		<shortDescription>Low Budget Film At Its Finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are rating this low because it doesn't seem realistic or it doesn't compare to Indiana Jones, quit rating these films without watching them. Again, I find people rating films which they didn't even take the time to watch or try to understand. This is a low budget film and is closer related to fantasy/comedy than to realistic action. This is a B-Movie and directors of this style of film love to pour on the "CHEESE". The cast was great and they actually boosted the movement of the film for the sheer awe of seeing Stone and Chamberlain do some pretty dry humor. You can't even compare Indiana Jones to this as Lucas films are set to make the fantasy world come as close to reality as possible. This movie was completely the opposite. Great creativity. If you're looking for wires and obvious painted backdrops, again, you're not watching the movie. Laugh at those the second time you see the film.Chamberlain's character is asked to help a young attractive woman to help find her father, who was lost in an exploration looking for King Solomon's mines. Someone else is looking for the mines as well and will do anything to get there and keep others from getting the hidden treasures first.Find this and set up for a great party night. Definitely worth keeping for classic fun and enjoyment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Review summary: Mostly obvious knock-off of INDIANA JONES, but functions more as an entertaining parody. I've heard many bad reviews on this film. They all say "Indiana Jones rip-off" or "Worst movie ever". But to me, this is actually entertaining, and it's silly fun indeed. The film is usually called a rip-off because they see some elements they also saw in the Indy flicks. Truth be told, this has more in kin with the Lucas/Spielberg classic than H. Rider Haggard's classic adventure novel. But seeing the film, it actually has a lot of fun with itself. It wasn't meant to be taken seriously, and I agreed to the bargain. Richard Chamberlain is not that heroic as Indy, but he throws in a lot of jokes to make viewers crack a smile. Sharon Stone shouts, complains, whines in the entire journey, but what would you expect on a big-screen debut. Herbert Lom, as I see it, is being more of funny than sinister intentionally. Same goes for John Rhys-Davies, but he looks more villainous. But it wasn't all parody and humor. "King Solomon's Mines" is also action-packed. Perhaps one of the real downer in the action department are the special effects (terrible process shots!) and stunts (the most obvious stunt doubles ever!!). Still, we have crocodiles, tribesmen, Nazis and exploding caves of lava. Perhaps it's my love for old-fashioned adventure that made me like this silly, mostly campy adventure, but I couldn't deny the guilty pleasure I had with it. Overall, this is actually functions as an enjoyable tongue-in-cheek adventure flick, but make sure you leave any pretense of common sense at the door. It's stupid fun. Rating: *** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rip-off or classic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I read a lot of the reviews here and it seems to be pretty divided as to whether or not this is a good movie. So here's my 2 cents. In my opinion this was not trying to be Indiana Jones. I think the intension was to make a campy, cheesy spoof, and as that it succeeds fantastically. Keep in mind this was the early - mid 80's. Cheezeball B-movies were all the rage and popular. Look was came out in around that period. King Solomon's Mines, a year later a sequel, Lost City of Gold. But we had many other great cheese movies like Ice Pirates, Dungeonmaster, Dragonslayer, Spaceballs, just to name a few. Conan the Barbarian spawn a whole subgenre of barbarian movies as did Road Warrior for post-apocalyptic movies. I'm sure there where other movies of these subjects before, but these were the ones that really kicked it off for those subgenres. I think that many of those who are complaining that King Solomon's Mines is so bad are those who are too young to remember and appreciate these movies that came out in around that period or those who decided it's not "cool" to like cheesy movies.Of course you can't compare the effects to that of Raiders of the lost Ark. Raiders had a near unlimited budget for the day, how do you compete with something like that? And do you honestly think that they blatantly ripped off scenes without getting permission first? I wouldn't be surprised if Lucas is making a small royalty of these movies, or at least did back when it came out. Yes, they rode the Raiders wave. Why is it that we criticize someone for riding a winning wave? If I had the chance, I'd do it in a heartbeat. I would argue that any of these movies have more heart than most of what comes out of Hollywood these days. These were made back when, for the most part, budgets were tight and people made movies for the love of making movies.Having a weakness for violent gore movies and foreign, B-Movies and foreign probably comprise 60% of my DVD collection and 70-80% of my VHS collection. Almost 600 movies combined. But I have a rare gift to be able to sit down and watch a movie without comparison to another and judge it on it's own. That's why my collection contains everything from Little Mermaid and Aladdin to Cannibal Holocaust(Uncut) and Salo: 120 Days of Sodom(Uncut), from The English Patient to, yes, King Solomon's Mines. (I do, however, have Lost City of Gold on VHS) So sit back, try to watch movies without any preconception of what you are about to watch. Critics, friends, rumors are just that. You are your own person, make up your own mind. If you can't do this, you are probably looking at the wrong movie. All you will see is a bad Raiders rip-off and you should stick to what you know or "reality" *Ya Right* TV.And that's my 2 cents.ME</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fun flick, based on the original story by Rider Haggard but with lots of bits from other sources, along with some totally humorous and almost unbelievable "stuff". If you want a serious flick and are the type who takes notes during the show, go somewhere else. If you want some genuine old-fashioned, borderline ridiculous entertainment along with your big bowl of popcorn, this is definitely it. Sharron Stone's character is a trip. The bit with her taking over the position of pilot in a commandeered biplane, even though she has never even been in a plane let alone flown one, is absolutely a scream. "Vroom!" was her exact summation of the experience. As for the Germanic presence in the dark Continent, as insinuated in this version of "Solomon's Mines", this is historically correct for the time, though far from accurate in its presentation; but this is entertainment! This edition of "Solomon's Mines" is not intended to be an accurate re-run of earlier flicks. If you gotta have precision and accuracy, see the '40's version with Stu Grainger and Liz Kerr. If you want some good entertainment of the non-serious vein, this is a good one. I've worn out my VHS version and am beating the bush for a DVD replacement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>KSM: A Brilliant Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A long time ago, I was introduced as an "outsider" to a group of boys who would get together once a month to have a "Cheese Fest" of real bad movies. We watched three movies, and laughed until we cried. When it was over, I shyly suggested a movie called "King Solomon's Mines". They had never heard of the film, or hadn't seen it yet. This was my opening to be "cool" with the gang.At the next gathering, I came over with a VHS copy I rented from a store. We watched it, and had to stop the movie several times because we were laughing so hard! We all agreed that this was the best worst movie we had ever seen! About two days later, my front door bell rang, and it was the boys there to give me a gift! I had been "accepted" into their gang! Many nights of "Cheese Fests" followed, but none were as successful as the night we watched "King Solomon's Mines"! The gift, by the way, was the very VHS copy of "KSM" (which we pronounce; "Chaos, Mmm") I had rented! I still have it to this day, and have shown it to many friends who thank me every time while wiping away a tear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie rated so low by others but by some it gives them a reminder of indiana jones. Next to those movies this one is the next best. I would recommend it to indiana jones fans who have been waiting years for another sequel. This movie has a sequel too which is almost as good but get a bit slower at the end. The movie is really good though. I enjoyed the storyline, the actors, the music by Jerry Goldsmith is very enchanting, the only thing i could say isnt that good in this film are the special effects but for the time being it will do. Theres nothing to lose so go out and rent it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok i shall start by saying i am a huge Indiana Jones fan and when i saw this recently i thought it was a ghastly copy, but i think as the film progresses it gets better and some of the scenes late in the movie are very impressive - particurly when john rhys-davies forces the german guy to eat the diamonds. I liked most of the scenes with john ryhs-davies in but i was slightly disappointed to see him in rip-off of Indiana Jones as he was in Raiders of the Lost Ark. So overall this film isn't that bad to watch, its quite fun really but it is nothing compared to the mighty Indiana Jones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good effort at replicating Raiders!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not as bad as "Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold". It has some content of sheer excitement and adventure in it. But for most people who had already watched "Raiders of the Lost Ark" have definitely harbored discriminatory feelings and complements for this action film.As far as action, adventure and fantasy is concerned, it was a good raw effort by J. Lee Thompson who had earlier two great feathers to his cap namely, "The Guns of Navarone" and "MecKenna's Gold". However, the next sequel of this series i.e., "The Lost City of Gold" is indeed a hopeless effort to bewitch the audience who are used to viewing better films.Nevertheless, KSM is an interesting and reasonably well directed piece of motion picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A campier take on the Indiana Jones Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie will forever be dogged by the shadow of elder brother Raiders of The Lost Ark, when in actual fact the movie far more resembles that movies little brother, Temple of Doom. Now O.K., this is typical Cannon material. A blatant attempt to imitate more succesful efforts, and if sometimes in this movie anyway, things dont come off as intended the movie will LOOK bad. However, when all is said and done this is one of the better Cannon movies. Richard Chamberlain is simply wonderful as an Adam West-Alike Quatermain. Oblivious to the world around him. Sharon Stone too does well, with what silly dialogue she is given, and the rest of the cast [ John Rhys Davies etc ] take things seriously, which helps the film. The one thing that does let the movie down is the direction. Which is a carbon copy of the Indiana Jones movies. Maybe Cannon encouraged this, but J. Lee Thompson is in all honesty an uninspired director,. Maybe a younger director would have spurned the chance to out Spielberg Steven, and we might have had a better movie. Jerry Goldsmith's Theme is also badly under-rated but adds to the excitement, and enjoyment. When watching this movie dont take too seriously and sit back and enjoy a campy, Batmanesque movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adventures , humor and romance in the exotic African jungles starred by the legendary Allan Quatermain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This new agreeable version from H. Rider Haggard adventure follows again Allan Quatermain played by a likable Richard Chamberlain . However , the original novel took place in the 1880s or earlier, but this film moves Quatermain's adventures to the era of World War I, in an unusual case of a semi-update . This is the adventure of a lifetime starred by a fortune hunter called Allan Quatermain (one of the members of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) who teams up with a resourceful woman (Sharon Stone , according to her memoirs Kathleen Turner turned down the role of Jesse) to help her find her missing father lost in the wilds of 1900s Africa while being pursued by hostile tribes , a rival German explorer (Herbert Lom) and a slaver Arab named Dogati (John Rhys-Davies who along with Richard Chamberlain starred TV-series "Shogun") . Allan is leading a safari in search of legendary diamond mines and to save the damsel's father . They are pursued by German soldiers and must confront natives , animals and several dangers and risks until they find the King Salomon's mines . The brave hunter and the elegant lady become fast friends, confronting magic rites and cannibals in search of legendary diamonds mines . While a native (Ken Gampu) is reclaiming his rights over throne of an African tribe next to King Salomon's mines .This amusing spoof picture displays exciting action , thrills , humor with tongue-in-cheek , extraordinary adventures and outlandish cliffhanger situations abound . Richard Chamberlain as Quatermain is passable , though Stewart Granger in the classic of the 50s -by Compton Bennett, Andrew Marton and with Debora Kerr- is incredibly missed . Heat and ills affected the crew and main actors but Sharon Stone surprised for her resistance . Polished and colorful production design by Luciano Spadoni , though in low-budget and excessive transparency . The natives are played by a real ethnic people from Zimbabwe . Evocative as well as glowing cinematography by the Mexican Alex Phillips, being shot on location in Harare, Zimbabwe . Special mention to rousing and thrilling musical score by the great Jerry Goldsmith . The motion picture was middlingly directed by J. Lee Thompson , though filmmaker Tobe Hooper was attached to direct early in production . This film arrive in theaters in 1985, the year of the 100th anniversary of the first appearance of Allan Quatermain in the novel King Solomon's Mines in 1885. The sequel, Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold (1987), adapted the novel Allan Quatermain (1887), it was an impressive accomplishment that Quatermain had two films arrive in theaters for his centenary celebrations .Other versions of this known story are directed by Robert Stevenson, a 1937 version in which the supreme role was performed by the singer Paul Robeson who proved his singing faculties. The best and classic version resulted to be directed by Compton Bennett, Andrew Marton with Stewart Granger and Debora Kerr . Kurt Neumann directed a rendition titled ¨Watusi¨ with George Montgomery and David Farrar . And TV adaptation directed by Steven Boyum with Patrick Swayze and Alison Doody, among others . Furthermore , ¨King Salomon's mines¨ was filmed concurrently with its sequel, "Allan Quatermain and the City of Gold" starred by same duo along with James Earl Jones and Henry Silva directed by Gary Nelson .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How the 1980s managed to be less politically correct than the 1880s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>H. Rider Haggard's "King Solomon's Mines" has been filmed a number of times, but this is the only version I have ever seen. It is only very loosely based on the original novel; a greater influence seems to have been the first two episodes of the Indiana Jones franchise. The action is brought forward from the 1880s to the time of the First World War in order to make the main villain a German; "Raiders of the Lost Ark" had been set in the 1930s with Nazi villains. Haggard's Allan Quatermain becomes an action hero based on Indy himself, complete with bush hat (although without the bullwhip). Like Indy, Quatermain has a glamorous young female companion, Jessie Huston (who bears certain similarities to Willie in "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"). His male companions from the original novel, apart from the faithful African servant Umbopa, disappear.The 1980s are sometimes regarded as the decade which gave birth to the concept of political correctness, but there is little evidence of it in this film. (There is not a lot of evidence of it in "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" either). For a film made in 1985, "King Solomon's Mines" achieves the difficult task of being, by a considerable margin, less politically correct than its source novel, published exactly one hundred years earlier. Haggard is never entirely free of late-Victorian assumptions about race, but he does treat his African characters with dignity and allows them major roles in his novel as heroes and heroines, not merely as villains. He even allows himself a romance between the African maiden Foulata and the white Englishman Captain Good. Interracial romances might have been acceptable to readers in 1880s England, but cinema audiences in 1980s America seem to have been more puritanical on this point. Neither Foulata nor Good appears in the film, and Quatermain's love-interest is supplied by the white Jessie, played by a young Sharon Stone. American squeamishness about mixed-race romance does not appear to have diminished in the quarter-century since 1985; in the recent film version of "Around the World in Eighty Days" Phileas Fogg's love-interest was a white Frenchwoman, not an Indian woman as in Jules Verne's novel. The most offensive thing abut the film, however, is the treatment of the African tribe, the Kakuanas. In Haggard's version they may have been noble savages, but here they are portrayed as ignoble ones, bloodthirsty cannibals who love to cook white people in a huge iron cauldron. This same old cartoon cliché comes up in the 1950s movie "Gentleman Marry Brunettes", but at least there its offensiveness is somewhat mitigated by its being presented in the context of a stage show; in "King Solomon's Mines", by contrast, the film actually appears to be suggesting that this is how real Africans behave. Ethnic stereotyping is not confined to Africans; we also have a treacherous, sadistic Turk and a ruthless, bullying German colonel. The film's problems are not confined to its racial attitudes. It was evidently made on a much lower budget than the Indiana Jones films, and the action sequences and special effects are not in the same class. The story is frequently illogical, confusing or both. Richard Chamberlain makes a lightweight action hero compared to Harrison Ford and Sharon Stone does not show any evidence of the qualities which would later make her a major star, other than her sex appeal which is much on display. About halfway through the film someone obviously thought that Sharon was not showing enough of her sex appeal, as it is notable that throughout the later scenes her shorts gradually get shorter and tighter, until she ends up wearing a pair of minuscule hot-pants which in the 1910s would probably have got their wearer arrested for indecency. Male viewers, however, might as well enjoy the sight of Sharon's legs; there is precious little else in this movie to keep anyone amused. The only thing that surprises me is that the film-makers evidently thought highly enough of the film to follow it with a sequel "Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold" It is sad to think that the director J. Lee Thompson was once responsible for films as good as "Yield to the Night", "Ice-Cold in Alex" and "Cape Fear". 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREAT FILM!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favourite films, as it is so easy to watch, i think the director was being Padraic of other action/adventure films and that is why it appears cheesy. I think the areoplane scene which we can tell is really fake, is meant to make you laugh. I particularly like the way secretly Sharon Stone's shorts within the film start as clam diggers and by the end of the film she almost has hot pants on (typical Hollywood male gaze of woman). I think for that time the special effects were excellent for an action/adventure treasure hunter film. I like the narrative of this film, as its not really complicated, i also like the way light is used in the tree tops when sharon &amp; quatermain meet the upside-down people. This film is perfect to watch hungover eating warmed up pizza from the night before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The king of all Indiana Jones rip-off !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got this movie a while ago from a video store that was having a sales on old vhs movies. I watched it with a friend that weekend and we loved it. Everything in this movie is so weird and off the wall that it turns a low budget Indiana Jones rip-off into a great adventure movie. Richard Chamberlain does a good job as Allan Quatermain being heroic and saving the damsel in distress played by a young (and very pretty) Sharon Stone. The bad guys are played by two fun actors (Herbert Lom as a german general and John Rhys-Davies as an evil turkish man) who are in over-acting mode.The story is totally different from the book the movie is based on. They changed it to a more Indiana Jones-esque story in which Allan Quatermain great hunter/adventurer must help a girl find her father and stop the "eeeevil" german soldiers from getting to the King Solomon's Mines. What makes it so great is all those scenes that make you go "Did i just really see that ?".****SPOILERS AHEAD ! WARNING !****Quatermain trying to rescue the girl's dad on a train, barges into a wagon full of german soldiers then realizes his mistake. What do they do ? Do they shoot him ? Do they arrest him ? No ! Quatermain ask one of the guy for his trumpet, start playing some music while walking across the wagon and for some unknown reason everybody starts singing along happily until he leaves.The dialogue is also one of the fun aspect of this film. There's a scene in which a man gets crushed to death by a spike trap against a door in a shop and all the shop owner says is "My door !!" while looking sad. FUNNY STUFF ! Also when the german general says that german makes the best laxative after eating diamonds. All those lines are gems !****End Spoilers****If you're looking for a fun cheesy adventure movie that doesn't take itself seriously, then i recommend this movie else you should skip it.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow!!! This movie was incredible!!! I heard about it awhile back and hadmade many Allan Quatermane jokes about it before I finally saw it. I was expecting a terrible low budget novelty flick but what I got was breathtaking!!! King Solomon's Mines is one of the most relentlessly action packed campy films I've ever seen...and I don't think I've ever laughed so hard in all my life. From the opening sequence to the last frame I was rolling on the floor laughing like a madman at Allan Quatermane's crazy exploits!! Richard Chamberlain is great as a two-fisted treasure hunter\romantic icon with an adventurous twinkle in his eye. Sharon Stone is the next Kate Capshaw!!! J. Lee Thompson is a brilliant Director!!! Why may you ask? See this film, it never slows down...when I finished it I sat speechless for a moment of reflection and realized that the movie I just watched was in real-time!!! All that high energy fun took place over an hour and a half. This is a cinematic gem and it better have a 2-disc special edition DVD because I'll be first in line to buy it. So if you want the fastest, funniest, entertainingnest darn movie around King Solomon's Mines is the ticket!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>9 out of 10 hoots on my Hoot-o-Meter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another love-or-hate film, with opinion fairly strongly tilted toward "hate". Media critics certainly did. As I'm fond of reminding people who read my reviews, what do media critics know? They hate almost anything that doesn't look like what's in some museum old movies hang in.This particular film has plenty to hate. It's an obvious imitation "Raiders of the Lost Ark". It hasn't got a lot in common with the H. Rider Haggard book, much less the classic older film. It features Richard Chamberlain (some weird people find this a drawback). It's played for laughs. A lot.These are actually positive factors, of course.Allan Quatermain is the spiritual ancestor of Bernard Quatermass ? if you know who that is. It doesn't help when people mispronounce the first 2 syllables of either name as if spelt "quaRter". There's evidence that the first syllable should be pronounced as //qu&amp;#257;// (that is, //kway//), which is how the British pronounce it in the Qu&amp;#257;termass films.The film's plot, inasmuch as it barely resembles the original work, is irrelevant. It's merely a backdrop for snappy dialogue and funny business. This version of "Mines" is in fact a parody ? not only a parody of the main title, but a parody of "Raiders of the Lost Ark". If the similarity of scenes in Cairo in the latter and the jungle-border city (whose name I forget) isn't a dead giveaway, the presence of John Rhys-Davies in both films, playing roughly similar rôles, should be (in the former he's a bad guy, in the latter a good guy).I have no quarrel with parodying both "Mines" and "Ark" ? which have enough similarity of plot to allow that ? and one can certainly enjoy the film on its own. The problem is targeting the wrong flick at the wrong time ? that is, parodying a recent film ("Ark") by parodying either an old film or an even older book. Alas, the object of the parody needs to be familiar to the audience, and actually few in this film's audience would have seen the old film (1937), much less read Haggard's book. (If anyone is thinking that I forgot the TV version, please note that it was a year later than the 1985 film.) This would have been a far better film at its root, as a parody of "Ark", had it been wholly unrelated to Quatermain and had a different title.Speculation aside, this is a lighthearted and fairly funny film when taken on its own. It certainly has a good cast ? and a good thing that is, too. Characters and dialogue are painted with very broad strokes, and in the hands of lesser performers would seem overly clownish. As it is, the line is perilously close to being crossed ? and I daresay some will suggest it's actually crossed quite a bit. The title rôle is taken by the enormously talented Richard Chamberlain once (as Dr. Kildare) the heart-throb of thousands of hyper-hormonal young females in the '60s. Here the bloom of youth is gone, but the charm (not to mention the talent) is still there. As a parody, this is pretty much a farce ? it doesn't entirely succeed in that venue, but to the extent it does succeed, it owes that to Chamberlain as well as other excellent talent.Chamberlain's employer and later love interest, Jesse (sic)* Huston, is played by the delightful Sharon Stone. She and Chamberlain have a chemistry that helps things rollick along. Set in the 1890s, "Mines" has the Imperial German Army and German imperial ambitions replacing the only slightly more distasteful Nazis and Nazi ambitions in "Ark". These forces are personified by the cartoon cardboard of Col. Bockner, played by the wonderful Herbert Lom. His is the greatest comic talent here, and he succeeds almost beyond hope in making Bockner satirically funny instead of farcically stupid. John Rhys-Davies plays Dogati, the petty governor-dictator of the small African town of ***** (I forget; consider it a Senior Moment). This part is a marvelous parody of his rôle in "Ark". He plays it up well, always taking (insofar as possible) the comedic high rode. Rhys-Davies is one of those greatly talented Welsh actors who show up with greater frequency than the tiny population of Wales would account for. Finally there's the excellent South African actor, Ken Gampu. He plays Haggard's native character Umbopa (here misspelt Umbopo). This is, inexplicably, not a comic role ? and Gampu carries it of with impressive dignity and physical presence.((*Nowadays most people are clueless as to names -- for instance, those who spell the female name "Marian" (Latin Maria) as if it were the male name "Marion" (Latin Marius). Similarly, "Jesse" is a male name, as in King David's father. The female version is "Jessie". Of course, naming your daughter Jesse or Marion (shudder) is a damn sight better than saddling her with "Moonbeam Teapot Beach-Pismo" or "Wingnut Pramalot Black-Smith-Wesson" or whatever people are naming their kids nowadays.)) Another major talent, whose name puzzlingly doesn't appear in the credits, is the very talented Bernard Archard. Archard, who has had a long and distinguished career, has done very little in film or TV since 1987 and nothing since 1992. Here he plays a fair-sized minor role ? Sharon Stone's father Professor Huston.Side note: this film and Haggard's book make the common error of locating King Solomon's mines in Africa. Hogwash. Solomon's authority never extended even into Arabia, much less into the Dark Continent.Ultimately, my advice in watching this film is: don't get up-tight about how it's not really very much like Haggard's original creation, how it's terminally silly, how ? well, you get the idea. It's actually a lot of fun, and rather good fun at that, thanks to the high caliber of its performers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was so bad, it was ALMOST good in its badness, but not quite. It pulled only the very thinnest of plots from one of the best adventure novels ever written. In fact, if I hadn't read the novel or seen other movie adaptations of the story, I'd have been even more lost. I must admit, though, that the quality improved --somewhat-- toward the end. Sharon Stone's acting was just plain bad (she's gotten much better since this movie), but patient viewers are rewarded later in the movie by some nice views of her pretty legs as her costume gets mysteriously shorter and tighter as the story progresses. Richard Chamberlain seemed a bit like Pee-Wee Herman with a beard, wearing an Indiana Jones outfit. The rest of the characters are largely forgettable and unexplained, but John Rhys-Davies actually did a fine job. The musical score often seemed out of place, so much so that at times it was a distraction. See it if you must. There are worse ways one could spend two hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie and I think it is a great spoof. I think we need a little clean humor in this industry of movie making. The lines are great and why not have a little fun with it? Sharin Stone may have been starting out but hey, you have to start somewhere and why not do it with a little fun. I think making the movie must have been hilarious. Granted Indiana Jones has some classic lines and Harrison Ford pulls it off most excellently, there are still some great jokes in the movie. Give the producers a break. They probably had to start out somewhere as well. Take the movie for the comedy and silly acting for what it is: entertainment, because, after all the is what it is all about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jesse Huston (Sharon Stone) is on a mission to find her lost father, she enlists the help of legendary explorer Allan Quatermain (Richard Chamberlain) and both of them set off on their perilous journey.Bland, routine and deserving of its reputation as an illegitimate sprog cash in of Indiana Jones. Director J Lee Thompson and his writers adapt H. Rider Haggard's classic novel and effectively hope that writing set piece after set piece will make for an exhilarating adventure movie. It doesn't. Bad script, bad acting, poor special effects, roller-coaster pacing, cringe-worthy dialogue and the sets look to have been knocked up overnight. It's not as if Chamberlain &amp; Stone can't act, because they can, it's just that they are reduced to cartoon fodder and both look very uncomfortable in doing so. John Rhys-Davies adds some fun as Dogati but poor Herbert Lom phones it in as an ultimate caricature German villain. There's some interest in the pre-fame Stone's attire for the red blooded male, watch as her shorts grow steadily shorter during the film. And for the girls who like beards, well Richie Chamberlain sports a candidate for the world's tidiest beard throughout the adventure mockery; tho not quite as tidy as the frothy one worn by a big old fake spider.Don't believe those who say it's in the "so bad it's good" category, it's just terrible and you are strongly advised to seek out either the 1937 or 1950 version instead. 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some reviewers here think that it's a fun movie because it's so ridiculous, sadly I can't share that feeling. Comparisons to Indiana Jones are out of place; a much better movie to measure it against is "Romancing the Stone", and it loses every single point. The main problem is not the cheap stock footage, nor the ridiculous script (that could basically work as a comedy), nor the silly sets and costumes - the main problem is the atrocious acting. A comedy needs actors and a director with good timing; it doesn't get funnier with bad acting but boring.This would really only get 1/10 from me if it weren't for Sharon Stone's legs which get more and more exposed throughout the story. I can't find any fault with those legs, so 2/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so somebody at Cannon decided it would be a good idea to make an Indiana Jones rip-off, utilising a 19th century boy's own adventure novel that hadn't been adapted for the screen for around forty years. Perhaps perceiving the ineptitude of the ensuing production, they did away with attempts at seriousness in favour of out-and-out comedy.This is a terribly, terribly poor film.I find comedy highly subjective, and as I have an unusual sense of humour I tend to dislike the genre (apart from rare treats like PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES). This is no exception. The jokes are lame, the overacting whiffs of embarrassment, the supporting characters are racist stereotypes. One of the "highlights" sees Quatermain and his love interest inside a huge cooking pot which they manage to tip over and roll down a hill. It's that kind of film.The backdrops are okay, but the special effects seem particularly dated for the age (case in point: the silly blue-screen effects used to convince us that Chamberlain is hanging over a pool of crocodiles). Chamberlain himself seems mildly embarrassed - and so he should, as his acting career never recovered from this double debacle (a sequel was shot at the same time). Sharon Stone, playing a dumb blonde sidekick, is the worst I've ever seen (equally as bad as Erica Eleniak in UNDER SIEGE). John Rhys-Davies seems to be reprising his role from the Indiana Jones films, while the only performance I enjoyed was Herbert Lom as a comic-book German colonel.Experienced action director J. Lee Thompson manages to give this film a decent pace and sense of momentum, but the woefully unfunny script scuppers it from the outset.</fullReview>

There are NO funny lines in this film.... if the creators wanted it to be funny they would have used some lines that WERE actually funny... no, I don't get a kick out of watching terrible site gags with wires, fake backdrops, fake everything and dull, forgettable, anything but funny performances.... NOW IF THAT's your bag baby...by all means rent this one. If I want that I'll watch a comedy....and if I want 'campy' comedy I'll watch 'army of darkness' or something that has A.Comedy...and B. a little of something else to offer...

THere's a REASON the networks NEVER replay this one.... NEVER.... it would be a broadcasting death sentence.King Solomon's is terrible. HOnestly, this is right there with Ishtar, Leonard Pt.6, and Pluto Nash as the worst high profile film ever made. I figured I'd write one review on 'my worst theater experience ever'... this is the choice.... We walked into the adjacent theater and watched the end of Rocky 4.... I could have killed my parents for making me sit through 3/4 of this film. I did revisit this about ten years later to confirm my opinion, and I must say, my opinion has not changed. The.....Worst.....EVER! If Indiana Jones sold out their rights and they made 12 MORE sequels with no-names(that nobody rented).... this would be the equivalent of 16th installment, probably starring some washed up wwe wrestler and Shaq. You can always notice the truly terrible films...the one's with bad numbers(here on IMDb) and a bunch of 1/13 'thought this comment was useful' votes from the 'OBSESSED IDIOTS'.

		<fullReview>King Solomon's Mines (1985) is the best action and adventure movie I have ever seen. I think Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone are excellent in the lead roles. My two favourite scenes are when Quatermain jumps through the sun roof and lands on his feet on the table in the House of Ises and the escape scene where Quatermain and Jessie steal a plane to get to the mine. Jessie doesn't know how to fly the plane and Quatermain is on the wing struggling to get in. Another plane flies towards them to try and stop them escaping and a fight scene ensues. The best bit is when Quatermain hangs off the wing and double kicks the pilot in the head, knocks him out and finally gains control of the plane. Fantastic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The remake of King Solomon's Mines 1985</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in mid-1985,KING SOLOMON'S MINES was an attempt of producers Yoram Globus and Menaham Golan's angle eventually to cash in on the success of the Indiana Jones films of the early-1980's. It was also the producers attempt to remake the classic 1950 film of the same title which starred Stewart Granger. But with limited and negative results.Was this the remake of Stewart Granger's 1950 adventure classic with carbon copy hints taken from Steven Spielburg's RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK? It might have been,but anyway its only one of those "B" action-adventure that were all over the place during the entire decade of the 1980's well into the 1990's. The remake of KING SOLOMON'S MINES was a movie upon its theatrical release in 1985,was clobbered by the film critics,but despite to the audiences liking it,it was well-received at the box office despite making it one of the worst films of that year. However,it is not necessary to duplicate the 1950 version,but as far as the action scenes along with high adventure and fantasy it was a good effort by director J. Lee Thompson who had earlier two fantastic films that were successful in their own right....one was the Oscar nominated 1961 adventure film "The Guns Of Navarone",and the 1969 adventure-fantasy western "McKenna's Gold"(both films starred Gregory Peck),does astounding work with some of the intense action scenes.The casting of Richard Chamberlain(WTF???)in the lead role was challenging,but he does do justice to Stewart Granger's film and gives a great performance as a thrilling and daring action-adventure hero in this remake. Who said that Richard Chamberlain was NO Harrison Ford??? Yes,that Richard Chamberlain of "Dr. Kildaire","The Towering Inferno",and "The Winds of War" was in dire straits here when he signed up for the lead role as the two-fisted action hero. Sharon Stone,before Basic Instinct and other role is casted as the damsel in distress who basically ends up being rescued by Chamberlain from the clutches of a rogue of villains.The only saving grace here is film composer Jerry Goldsmith's rousing score which is the only thing that kept this from falling apart. Enjoyable fare. Avoid the sequel ALLAN QUARTERMAINE AND THE CITY OF GOLD which is no where never as better as the first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those of you who've seen the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, that is probably as close as you'll ever get to a good modern Allan Quartermaine movie. This film was at best a good Idea that went sour very quickly, and turned out a mediocre product.I remember first seeing this movie when I was nine, and thought it was great. And that's all I can say, it's great for a nine year old Indiana Jones Fan. There are discrepancies, masses of poor dialogue, and very heavy handed (and I mean beating you over the head) moments of Plot summary, Love scenes, and...cannibals. even though there aren't that many tribes of cannibals in Africa, Hm...The discrepancies, are as such that it:-Takes place in the midst of WWI, not pre turn of the centruy. -Allsn Quartermaine was about Richard Chamberlains age in about 1845, so the movie is way off. - If Allan is the great white hunter, why does he have a sawed off shotgun, instead of a Hunters rifle? -What is an arabic/turkish town doing in the middle of africa? -What hapened to that great thing called exposition which tells you the background information? -Um...ALLAN QUARTERMAINE IS BRITISH.Aside from all these discrepancies (which plague the movie), it brims with campy jokes and situations. Which is okay if done in moderation, not every other line. The sad part about this movie is that it seems to have only been made to cash in on the popularity of Indiana Jones, which was made at about the same time. I mean, it has Sallah (john rhys davies), a pulling behind the moving vehicle stunt, and other tidbits stolen from the Indiana Jones Films that have been worked into a butchered version of H. Rider Haggard's original book (which is very well written, by the way).All in all it's a sad film that is mostly only good for a laugh, and reliving childhood memories. Beleive me, I liked it better as a fond childhood memory than as I do now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on H. Rider Haggard's novel, King Solomon's stars Richard Chamberlain as adventurer Allan Quatermain, who is enlisted by blonde babe Jesse Huston (Sharon Stone) to help find her father, who has gone missing while searching for the fables mines of King Solomon. Herbert Lom plays Nazi Colonel Bockner, who, with the help of wicked Turk Dogati (John Rhys Davis, sending up his own role in Raiders of the Lost Ark), also hopes to locate the legendary treasure.When I first saw this film (back in the '80s at my local Cannon flea-pit), I thought it was abominable, a shoddy Indiana Jones clone thrown together in a hurry to make a quick buck. I now realise my mistake: instead of being a cheap rip-off, it is in fact a sly send-up that mercilessly mocks the conventions of the genre, which explains the ridiculously hokey script, the incredibly far-fetched action scenes, the cruddy effects, and the camp performances from a cast who are obviously in on the joke. When viewed as such, one's enjoyment of the film is greatly enhanced.Director J.Lee Thompson certainly keeps the bonkers action moving along at a decent lick, with a silly sequence aboard a speeding (NOT!) train, a ridiculous scene that has hero Quatermain hanging onto the wing of a biplane piloted by a petrified Jesse, a tribe that lives upside-down in the jungle, a hilarious moment involving a cannibal tribe's massive cooking pot, and a really unconvincing giant spider attack. The film also boasts a surprisingly decent score from Jerry Goldsmith, who effectively mimics John Williams' famous Raiders theme, and benefits throughout from the appealing sight of the pre-fame Stone in tight shorts (that get shorter and shorter as the movie progresses).</fullReview>

Here is a man who is such a prolific actor in his own right, he didn't need to be in something so absurd. It's like imaging Charlton Heston appearing in a Van Damme movie..................oh wait a minute....But there is a lot of fun to be had. The special effects are so bad that the green screen should have been credited as a main character, and then there's the escape in the large cumbersome cooking pot, and the spider, one of the poorest special effects ever committed to the big screen.See it for all the wrong reasons, it's a film for lovers of bad movies, it's nothing seriously awful, because it's so stupid, but the sight of Chamberlain riding rail tracks like water skis does stay with you.......</fullReview>

The then 27-year-old Stone wears short shorts almost all throughout the movie, and after about two reels it's a strong bet that the audience was fixated on Sharon's gorgeous legs, never mind Chamberlin and his quest for African gold.The picture did well enough that the following year, 1986, a sequel was mounted, "Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold," again starring Richard Chamberlin and Sharon Stone. This time, however, Sharon wore long pants all the way through, and judging by the warm reception of Sharon's legs in the original film, there was absolutely NO reason to hide those perfect pins in the sequel.

I had no idea that Sharon Stone used to be this seriously hot, and it even appears that she might have had a sweet personality way back when. I really mean that she is unbelievably beautiful in this film like I've never seen her before. As another reviewer noted, a further bonus is that her shorts get progressively shorter as the story moves on. Otherwise, the acting is risible and the special effects are beyond cheesy. Also, I'm just another privileged white male, but it's obvious even to me that people of African/Arabian descent are likely to be offended by this film. Overall, this plays like a lame made-for-TV Indiana Jones rip-off (although I believe it is derived from books that predated that Spielberg effort) with distinct and weird tinges of racism given that it was made in 1985. My best guess is that Richard Chamberlain had alimony or back taxes or something hanging over his head. He was definitely slumming for a paycheck. I really don't want to sound creepy or obsessed, but I'm 100% completely serious when I say that the one and only reason to waste your time on this stupid movie is that Sharon Stone is truly stunning.

Aside from lots of laughter that it presents,it is not short on action and explosive scenes.Overall,try to enjoy and be entertained this movie which should have been titled,"King Solomon's Mines Lite."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Allan Quatermain (Richard Chamberlain), renowned adventurer, agrees to take a young woman (Sharon Stone) across Africa in search of her father. The search changes from the girl's father to a search for the legendary King Solomon's Mine. Along the way, they encounter wild animals, hostile natives, a ruthless Turkish fortune hunter, and an even more ruthless German fortune hunter. Given its inherent limitations, King Solomon's Mines almost works perfectly. Yeah, it's got the low budget you would expect from an 80s era Cannon/Golan-Globus Production. Special effects, while fun in a cheesy sort of way, really highlight the budget limitations. The plot feels little more than a shameless rip of Indiana Jones, but is still enjoyable enough. Most of the acting is at least acceptable. Sharon Stone's constant whining didn't bother me as much as some other reviews I've read. Overall, King Solomon's Mines is pretty good for what it is. Notice I said the movie worked "almost" perfectly. My main complaint and the reason I cannot rate it any higher is Richard Chamberlain's Quatermain. Whether it was Chamberlain or the way the character was written, he comes off as a phony. I'm not buying him as a rugged adventurer. He's too well quaffed and too well dressed to be taken seriously. He's too obviously an actor trying to play a rugged adventurer. And that hat - the leopard band looks ridiculous. A better character or better actor might have made King Solomon's Mines a better experience. My favorite part of the film has to be scene-stealing Herbert Lom. His Colonel Bockner is so over-the-top, it's often laugh-out-loud funny. The instances where he is on screen with John Rhys-Davis are a real treat, with each trying to outdo the other. Really good stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>but there aren't many. The acting by Stone is almost, but not quite, laughable. Her character in early fight scenes starts as a shrinking violent with lots of appropriate screaming and fear, but then goes on the attack punching and kicking with action hero-like skills. In each scene, she changes personality more rapidly than Loki. Is this her fault or the directors? It really doesn't matter as she delivers each line as if she were reading a script in early rehearsals.Chamberlain is OK, but the script gives him almost nothing to work with. A competent actor should make better choices over which roles to take.The script is nearly a carbon copy of an Indiana Jones film, and bears no relation to the novel or even earlier versions of the film (which, over time, has deviated further and further from the plot of the book). Attempts at humor are feeble and do little to make this film watchable.Sadly, it is not so bad that it is funny. To use a baseball metaphor, it sits at the Mendoza line for films - not bad enough to mock and not good enough to watch.Rather than watch this, re-watch the Last Crusade for the 1000th time. It will be a better use of your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why this movie was given such a low rating. I loved this movie as a kid and watching it on netflix was just as entertaining. People have to remember that this wasn't supposed to be better than Indiana Jones or compete with it. Its supposed to put a humorous spin on it. From the theme song, German bad guys, Quarterman's get up, its all jokes.Take Indiana Jones, add a truck load of jokes, sprinkle in some bad effects and this is what you add up with. A good movie to waste time with!Enjoy it for what it is and don't expect more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have mixed feelings about this one. I think I have to be in the mood to watch it. The 1st 1/2 is definately the best. By the time they reach the umpteenth tribe, there is a feeling of repetition. Chamberlain is not a bad choice really though he was 50 when he made it. I haven't seen any of the other versions nor read the book so I can't compare. The music is great and some of the humour is quite funny really. The 'you can always bargain' line always brings a smile to my face. In fact 1 or 2 other lines do the same. Obviously, not everyone will like this but it's a tongue in cheek, good natured, simple adventure movie that will keep the kids entertained. I have to say, however, that the sequel was awful!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indiana Jones - Golan/Globus style! *** out of *****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To the uninitiated Golan/Globus are Cousin's Menahem Golan &amp; Yorham Globus who were prolific producers of trash throughout the 80's making such 'classics' as Death Wish 2,3 &amp; 4 &amp; Missing In Action 1,2 &amp; 3 (basically keeping Charles Bronson &amp; Chuck Norris in work) among seemingly endless amounts of other less than fantastic fare released through their Cannon Film Studio.So if you come into King Solomon's Mines knowing what to expect (In essence a low budget B-Movie, done with some of the worse dialogue imaginable,terrible visual effects and non-intentional hilarious scenes) you should be able to sit back leave your Brain at the door and enjoy.While I realise this was made to capitalise on the success of Indiana Jones - Nobody watching this should compare the two, If anything this is a Indy spoofRichard Chamberlain stars as Allan Quatermain who teams up with a young woman (a Pre-stardom Sharon Stone) to locate her Professor Father who's gone missing in Africa. This has action in bucket loads, plenty of Comedy (some of it intentional - some of it not), The Acting is very hammy - baddies Herbert Lom is hilarious as is John Rhys DaviesDirected by J.Lee Thompson (The original Cape Fear &amp; The guns of Navarone) A great Director who sadly ended up making trash mostly starring Bronson for Golan/Globus.Filmed entirely in Zimbabwe - obviously back in that particular Country's good old days - Not Unsurprisingly it bombed taking just $238,000 on a $12,500,000 BudgetIt's not great film making, It'll never win any awards (apart from the Razzies) but as B-Movie fun it's good stuff.Surprisingly followed by a sequel (Yes! there's more) Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold was Filmed at the same time and released a year later.*** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before there was Indiana Jones there was Allen Quartermain. H Rider Haggard's great white hunter has been around for nearly a century and has been made in films a number of times. But never with as much fun as in this 1985 film with Richard Chamberlain. The filmmakers were sure enough of it's success that they filmed a sequel ("Allen Quartermain and the City of Gold") at the same time. In this version J. Lee Thompson goes for a spoof of the popular "Raiders of the Lost Ark." Especially interesting is the inclusion of John Rhys Davies, also in the cast of of the Spielberg/Lucas hit. Watch this one with tongue firmly in cheek and have a great time. Especially funny is the scene in the Cannibal camp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Next to some of the Indiana Jones movies this is surely one of the best adventure movies ever made. I've seen this movie atleast 10 times. I just love adventure movies about finding treasure, fighting bad guys and discovering secrets, all while rescueing the babes. That's why I also liked The mummy(1999). Alot of people are saying that this movie tries to copy Indiana Jones, well that's just not possible because even though this movie was made after the first Indiana Jones, the book for this movie was written first. The book is actually considered a classic. Sure the movie may have been made because of Indiana Jones popularity but it's still a great movie. The second one just doesn't live up to this one, though it's still fun to watch. I wish that they would make the rest of the Allan Quarterman books into movies. It would really be great. They should really make more movies like this. It's just that it's so hard to make a good adventure/treasure hunting/fighting/shooting movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I downloaded "The People of the Mist" to my Kindle by accident (another story by H. Rider Haggard) and loved it. I then learned that he also wrote King Solomon's Mines and that in actuality the Alan Quatermain character was the inspiration for Indiana Jones. The idiotic movie, as I remember it, couldn't possibly be any more loosely based on the novel. I haven't watched the movie in maybe 20 years, and I almost want to watch it now to see how far off from the novel it was. It was a farce and I'm sure that's not how Haggard intended it. I could go on and on about the characters that were missing and the story being not even remotely similar. I don't recall Sir Henry, Good, Ignosi, Gagool, King Twala, the whole thing about the battle to restore Ignosi as king, them getting trapped in the mine when gagool shut the stone wall, etc, etc. This is kind of annoying that you have to submit a 10 line review and that it takes 2-3 days to be posted. Not that what I'm posting here is interesting or anybody will ever care what I have to say. I just finished reading the book and wanted to say how absolutely dreadful and completely unrelated to the book the movie was. Is this 10 lines yet?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original Indiana Jones in an Unoriginal Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every now and again comes along a great movie. And almost immediately following the release of this movie comes several thousand imitators. In the 1980's two movies came out that were very similar, Raiders of the Lost Arc, and King Solomon's Mines. Both had a rugged hero looking for lost treasures in exotic locals. Both fought against sinister Nazi agents. Both wore hats. However, Raiders of the Lost Arc came out in 1981, while King Solomon's Mines came out in 1985. You decide which one was the imitator.Anyway, in King Solomon's Mines our hero, Alan Quartermain must find Sharon Stone's father. All the while being pursued by a Nazi colonel who is our comic relief. This movie has a strange feel to it, making it seem almost like a spoof of Raiders of the Lost Arc, and yet you know, deep down inside, that they were being serious in their efforts.By itself this movie would have been average at best, maybe even enjoyable. But when you compare it to the movie that is steals entire scenes from, you feel sad and lonely, and just want to have a good cry.Or maybe that's just me.</fullReview>

And the few times she does make it on her own, it's by playing on sex. And the movie is extremely racist. In fact, when a main character calls the natives "you god-damned black jews" about halfway through the movie, I thought that "wow, well at least it can't get anymore racist now". I was wrong.But in the end, it's this complete lack of political correctness that makes the movie enjoyable.

		<fullReview>Another review appearing on this site stated that it "just isn't possible that 'King Solomon's Mines' rips-off ' 'Indiana Jones' - the book was written first and is considered a classic." Yes, the book was written first, and is considered a pop literature classic - but this dreadful film bares only the most superficial resemblance to the book, and is quite clearly a rip-off of "Raiders". I personally lost count at 20 direct references IN THE FIRST TEN MINUTES!!!!!I am a huge "Indiana Jones" fan, and enjoy films like "The Mummy" which, while not coming close to true "Indy" quality, have fun with the same conventions. But "King Solomon's Mines" is horrible. The acting, writing, direction and production values are bottom of the barrels (which is to be expected for this obviously low budget film).That being said, there is a definite entertainment value to the unintentional laugh out loud comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indiana Quatermain and the Mines of Doom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>H. Rider Haggard's King Solomon's Mines is one of those stories where it often feels that only the title and the odd character name have been filmed. If there were a prize for the least faithful version, Cannon's 1985 romp would win hands down. Richard Chamberlain's Great White Hunter Allan Quatermain may be a reluctant guide on a quest for the fabled mines, but this time his only companion is Sharon Stone, eager to save her archaeologist father from Herbert Lom's dastardly and cartoonish Wagner-loving German officer (the plot has been updated to pre-WW1 Africa). No prizes for guessing that this is inspired more by Indiana Jones than H. Rider Haggard (it even co-stars John Rhys-Davies as another Arab, this time on the bad guys' side), with the stunts increasingly outrageous and the tone firmly tongue in cheek.Shot almost back-to-back with the dire Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold and originally brandishing the how-are-they-ever-going-to-fit-that-on-the-marquees title Allan Quatermain and King Solomon's Mines and the Lost Caves of Death, it's a film almost as overloaded as it's rejected title: for the first half or so it's surprisingly entertaining, but eventually the relentless energy starts to wear you down as you realise that the film's used up most of its best stunts and jokes and is running out of clichés to rehash and lampoon. Certainly there's nothing in the second half to match a comic marketplace chase or a very silly train rescue that sees Quatermain work his way through variations of Indy's truck chase before skiing along the rails as he holds on by his bullwhip... In many ways, DVD is an almost ideal way to see it: a little too much to sit through in one go, a self-created intermission certainly helps.Chamberlain makes an amiable if overly reliant on dynamite Quatermain, though Stone is an irritatingly screeching heroine and Lom too much of an over the top caricature to provide much threat. J. Lee Thompson keeps it moving, Jerry Goldsmith contributes an enjoyably heroic score and there's enough of a sense of fun to paper over the weak spots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this movie is not as good as the first Indy movie "Raiders of the Lost Ark" or the third, "Last Crusade" it compares rather favorably to "Temple of Doom" and "Kingdom of the Crystal Skull". It mainly can compete with those two movies as it has a very fast moving story and for a low budget picture they sure do get a lot of places. The story follows Allan Quartermane and this girl who I don't recall her name played by Sharon Stone as they go on a quest for the lost diamond mines of King Solomon. They have to fight their way there through hordes of bad guys, have a train ride, have a couple of chase scenes and get caught by cannibals and nearly get cooked. Then they have to get through the mines guarded by a very annoying witch lady, in fact the movie would have been better had she never entered the movie, yes she is that annoying. Still, for a low budget movie that I am sure was trying to capitalize on the success of the Indy films this movie was rather good, much better than the very boring sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It shouldn't take more than 10 or 15 minutes for a viewer to discern that this is a Cannon Films picture--the writing is atrocious, the acting is third-rate, the sets and effects are cheesy in the extreme, and the director apparently had more important things on his schedule than showing up on the set and telling the actors what to do. The "action" scenes are laughably inept (extras falling down as if they've been shot but no gunfire is heard, hand-to-hand "battles" that look more like two drunks lurching into each other, things like that). Richard Chamberlain tries to pull off an Indiana Jones and fails miserably (he acquitted himself much better in "Shogun," but Golan/Globus didn't have anything to do with that, which is probably why). Sharon Stone is gorgeous but gives an odd performance; at times she tries to come off like a strong-willed, independent Katharine Hepburn type, but at others she becomes a helpless, clinging, "oh save me you big handsome man" caricature. She finally becomes so annoying you want to say, "Jesus, Dick, let the cannibals HAVE her." Director J. Lee Thompson was more at home making Charles Bronson movies (he directed nine of them); he should have stayed with Charlie. This badly written, badly directed, badly edited, badly-everything'ed movie is not one I'd want on my resume.</fullReview>

Not only is it NOT Alan Quartermain, it tries (oh so very hard) to make you forget it isn't Indiana Jones. The effects, editing, and performances are not even remotely as good as the worst Indiana Jones moment, so don't get me wrong. It's not that successful. It sort of just lies there, looking cheap and gaudy, and malnourished while you attempt vainly again and again to find a reason why you're trying so hard to find anything worthy of your time.I have never seen the 1930's original. Nor have I seen the 1950's remake, so I have no basis for comparison, but I must say that this thieved and inferior version of Alan Quartermain is nothing like the Quartermain from the many books I've read. I would have to say that Connery's estimation of this character in "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" probably comes closest to this generations' version of the "real" Quartermain.Just save Chamberlain the embarrassment, and save yourself the wasted time.It rates a 4.2/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

The acting isn't even B-movie grade. The stunts are totally unbelievable. Sharon Stone should be ashamed, and no wonder Richard Chamberlain's career derailed (excuse the pun if you have seen the movie) and he didn't become a household name. The blue screen was some of the worst I've seen, even for the 80's. As a spoof, it definitely misses. As an Indiana Jones-type adventure, it really misses. If you don't like headaches, skip this movie. It's so bad it will give you one- and I like bad 80's movies. But this was just painful to watch and it was hard not to turn it off and chalk it up to a waste of $4.99. Just get Indiana Jones and let the good times roll.

There are about 2.7 cheesy gasoline-fed explosions per minute, and Sharon Stone doesn't show very much of her body. The Turkish opportunist and the German general are broad (and bad) caricatures. The film's Israeli producers must have taken great delight in introducing a bumbling German army to the script, but it's all a bit childish.The 1950 version was much better, and I hope to see the 1937 version soon.

		<shortDescription>Feeble Indiana Jones rip-off.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alas, poor J. Lee Thompson. This once great British film director started out making such classics as Cape Fear, The Guns of Navarone and Northwest Frontier, but in the late '70s and early '80s he was reduced to such terrible fare as The Passage, Happy Birthday To Me and this utterly ludicrous Indiana Jones rip-off. Spare a thought too for some of the actors involved: Richard Chamberlain, Sharon Stone, Herbert Lom and John Rhys-Davies all must look back with regret at this ill-advised career mis-step. It's based very loosely on the H. Rider Haggard novel of the same name, but its inspiration is much more obviously taken from Raiders of the Lost Ark. The original story is updated to World War I, and the search for the legendary mines is no longer a battle against the elements: the heroes in this one are involved in a race against the Turkish army, who want to reach the mines first so that they can fill their pockets. Chamberlain plays Allan Quatermain for laughs, but the script doesn't provide him with any genuinely funny material. Stone's female character screams and whinges a lot and, although sexy to look at, becomes enormously irritating well before the end. The action scenes are also played for laughs, with the most ridiculous moment of all coming during a train sequence, when Chamberlain is dragged along behind the train while clinging onto a chain (he discovers that by standing up and placing his feet on the tracks, he can be pulled along like the back-carriage!) And how many times does Rhys-Davies seem to die only to come back to foil the hero? King Solomon's Mines is a really terrible film, but beware: there's a sequel and it's even worse! Avoid Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold like the plague: it makes this film look like a mini-masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Retarded adventure movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was terrible. You would think a movie like this could be enjoyed by kids, at the very least. But it isn't GOOD enough to be enjoyed by ANYBODY! I saw this movie when I was a kid, when all the other rip-offs of Raiders of the Lost Ark were being released. This was another bad movie in a long list of bad imitations. Richard Chamberlain tries to act cool and suave, and just comes off as an idiot. And Sharon Stone, well, we all know she can't act anyway. This is actually the kind of movie that really fits her as an actress. Has anybody besides me noticed that Sharon Stone can't act her way out of a paper bag?This movie was terrible. The plot was ridiculous, the acting was terrible, the directing was terrible...overall, I HATED IT! I hope you don't ever waste your time seeing it, but on the other hand I hope other people can see it so that they can realize how much I suffered when I had to sit through this pile of crap!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw the worst film I have ever seen. Yes, you're right, it is called "King Solomon's Mines". Until I saw it I didn't think that any film could be worse than "Deep Blue Sea", but now i got wiser. King Solomon's Mines" is a typical Hollywood-film, with unrealistic stunts (e.g. when Quatermain manages to stand behind the moving train on his feet!) and a plot so dumb that you can't imagine any worse. Also, at a point where Hollywood usually is good, namely on background and landscape scenes, this film looks as if it were made in the 1920'ies. Therefore: Give me one good reason to like this film. I can't find any, except from Sharon Stone's appearence. And that it not enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't a fan of the 1950 adaption but decided to give this one a chance anyway, mainly because of the two leading roles by Chamberlain and Stone. But oh did I waste 2 hours! What the movie is about? Well, actors screaming 'put me down' and 'let go of me' about 100 times, the most ridiculous conversations (you knackwurst eating hypocryt!), some tag along black man who suddenly is leader of an african tribe (I really didn't get that part but I was not really paying attention), a really really stupid scene with a 'human sized soup bowl' (I don't know how to explain otherwise) and some other ridiculous stuff. In short: To be avoided! 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Accept only Indian Jones - all else is a complete waste of time.From the opening moments when the spiky contraption appears out of nowhere to bringing down the roof of a cave with a pistol is utter nonsense. Wagner started to grate after a while. The acting was wooden and the 'special' effects abysmal - you could make out where the green screen was used while Richard Caberline is hanging over the crocodile pit, and climbing out of the molten pit those chains should have been red hot. The huge cooking pot was banal, the upside down guys ridiculous. Jumping out of a perfectly serviceable plane on the premise that "It Might Blow" (but no more than the film!) It was just all wrong. Add to this the tenet that the (raw) diamonds belong to the mountain and yet they still take two lumps of perfectly cut crystal and throw in the seemingly invincible Dogati and you have the worst rip-off movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why can't you give a score LOWER than a one on IMDb? If ever a film deserved it, it's this one! After all, I had such high hopes when I saw this in the theater (I was one of the FEW who apparently paid to see this crap). The ORIGINAL filmings of this tale (1937 and 1950) were exciting adventure stories AND the newest re-make starred Richard Chamberlain (a fine actor), so I had VERY high hopes!!! Aggghhh, the humanity!!! It turned out this was about as boring and dopey a remake as was possible! Instead of an exciting adventure epic, at times the movie was pure camp and played for laughs. This MIGHT have been okay except that the movie bounced back and forth and couldn't make up its mind WHAT to be. BUT, the all-time worst scene was Chamberlain and a VERY young Sharon Stone stuck in a giant cannibal pot filled with obviously plastic floating vegetables. How to get out of this mess (other than just wisely walking off the picture)? They rocked back and forth until the pot flipped and the pot rolled away with them in it! This was apparently one of the FUNNIER moments, so the laughs(?) only got more forced and annoying from there! AVOID THIS MOVIE LIKE THE PLAGUE!!! Also, this movie AND ITS SEQUEL were filmed simultaneously (oh no, there's more). I don't think the sequel ever made it to theaters and I hope all copies were burned but I am afraid that it's probably floating around somewhere out there. BEWARE!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can you say rip-off?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I almost utterly soiled myself when I read that is their words "is the best action and adventure movie I have ever see(n)". Then noticing it was from England I'm not the least bit surprised. Most of the action movies produce BY British film companies (not American companies utilizing their film stages) are at the best sub-par. It's like someone took the script of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' that had been translated from English to German to Spanish to Chinese to Portugese to Nordic then back to English again and said "Hey, maybe we can cash in on the Indiana Jones craze, but this time use mainly b-list actors (well, Henry Silva is more of a d-list), a poor script and shallow acting...what a recipe for success!...even a better idea...we know this movie will be such a huge hit we'll make a sequel at the same time (see Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold)." Both movies bombed worse than 'Ghosts Can't Do It' on a slow day.Then the reviewer chimed in with "Fantastic!" to close their review. Apparently they must be on some kind of mind-altering substances (know where I can get some?). In any case, my recommendation is to see the original and NOT the poor twelve-off copy and my advice to the person from England : get out more....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why are the Germans always depicted as bad guys in these sort of films?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"King Soloman's Mines" is a good-intentioned action flick withsuch a bad rep, it can be placed on the "bomb shelf" in a videostore alongside "Howard the Duck" and "Ishtar!" Why? Why is thisfilm considered so bad? It ain't so for me. I happened to likethis movie because of the cool plot and nice performances by thestars, including Sharon Stone in her early years. RichardChamberlain is Allan Quartermain, the hero that precedes guyslike Indiana Jones. He's off finding the legendary mines likethe title suggests from nasty Germans, led by Col. Bockner(Herbert Lom of "The Pink Panther"). That's another question Iwant answered: why are the Germans always the bad guys in filmslike this? Are they always this prone to be villainous? It'sgetting to be an awfu</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The single most stereotypical and racist movie ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Solomon's Mines had the potential to be just as good and Indiana Jones. The main problem in this movie is not that it had a small budget, but that it seemed to be geared towards 5-year olds. It sounds like it was written by 5-year olds as well.Things I learned from King Solomon's Mines: Africans like to swing upside-down from trees. Africans like to boil people in large pots and eat them. People explode violently when they fall in lava. Africa is home to gigantic man-eating spiders with plastic webs. Germany could have won WW2 using a few million dollars worth of gold and diamonds. Sinking sand is lethal. (It is generally only a few feet deep, contrary to popular belief) There are evil African tribes who like to feed people to alligators.And why do all the explosions in this movie look like the destruction of the death star? And why did all the natives look like members of Insane Clown Posse or the voodoo indians from Live And Let Die? I should have stopped watching this when I saw the big dragon head eat the German. I feel much much dumber now. This movie was responsible for 75% of our incorrect assumptions about the world, specifically the sinking sand and the boiling pot scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie did not seem fun and fair like Indy...There were some racially offensive things about this film. Sharon calls an Arab a tile head...Most of the natives were absolute idiots...there was all the bad "dark" tribes and some wonderfully peaceful "light" tribe in in the trees. Just many offensive adjectives towards the "natives". But I would still watch it..For some reasons imitation movies pull me in like the originals.</fullReview>
