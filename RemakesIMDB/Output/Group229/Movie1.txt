		<shortDescription>Simply a great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aaron Copland believed great art goes hand in hand with simplicity. This movie is simple and great. I was browsing on the internet when I discovered some reviews of the R-1 DVD which heavily criticize the movie (and not just the DVD). I gave a quick look at IMDb to discover that, quite amazingly to me, the movie has only a 6.8 rating, that it has only been rated by less than a thousand viewers and that many viewer apparently found it boring. Let me just emphasize what should be obvious: this version of 'King Solomon's Mines' is not an action movie. It is probably best described as an invitation to Africa, combined with a reflexion on various aspects of what it means to be human. It many respects, it foreshadows and complements Clint Eastwood's 'White Hunter, Black Heart'.Let me mention just one striking 'detail': what's going on on screen is SO fascinating that no music has been added to the various sounds emanating from the country or from the music instruments of the African people themselves. This was a daring move, especially at the time, but it enriched the movie enormously. I will end this quick review with a piece of advice: Your mind should be as free as possible from everyday's life various troubles if you want to enjoy this movie. Pick up a night when you are already rather relaxed, and immerse yourself gently into the atmosphere created by the filmmakers. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This lost-civilization adventure continues to be a favorite among those who love a thrilling tale...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many reasons why people like classic movies, but often those reasons are quite sentimental in their nature... Perhaps the reason for its enduring appeal is that it intends nostalgic trip to the past, where such films spawned juvenile imagination with breathtaking locations, exotic hidden societies, and characters with strange powers...Like all trips into the African wild, "King Solomon's Mines" proceeds through all kinds of land-forests, swamps, desert sands, lush meadows and rugged mountains... The film is filled with exciting scenes, and some rather effective looks at human motivations in the face of impossible odds...The color photography of Robert Surtees, greatly increases the visual impact of the outdoor scenes and almost overpowers the plot drama at times... Surtees' landscapes are gorgeous?vista after vista of jungles, dunes, high peaks, river rapids and waterfalls...Stewart Granger was talented enough in playing the dashing romantic leading man... He created a human hero who is the ideal concept of the white hunter?suave, tough, courageous, and strongly British...Deborah Kerr, the 'lady with the flaming hair,' had a charming weakness that was strong and feminine at the same time...This lost-civilization adventure continues to be a favorite among those who love a thrilling tale... "King Solomon's Mines" is a well-cast version filled with qualities close to the human heart: thrilling, adventurous, and amusing...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great, Under-Appreciated Adventure Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I *LOVED* the Book "King Solomon's Mines" by H. Rider Haggard, and thought I should see the movie. I was warned to stay away from the 1985 remake, so I went with this one. This is a very good movie, especially for 1950, although characters and parts of the book were either left out or switched around. Stewart Granger is good as the hunter Allan Quatermain, and Deborah Kerr, although her character has nothing to do with the book what-so-ever, played her part well as Elizabeth Curtis. I was surprised to find out this film was shot entirely on location in Africa. It also has some great nature shots. This movie is hard to find or see on TV, so spring for the chance to see it if you get one! Even if you're not an adventure fan, this is still a good one. (It was nominated for best picture.) 4 out of 4 stars for "King Solomon's Mines!" But, don't stop there--READ THE BOOK!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that changed America's view of Africa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always maintained that this version of King Solomon's Mines along with The African Queen changed forever the face of Africa for the American audience. Our ideas of Africa were mainly developed by the Africa we saw created on studio back-lots for 20 years. MGM had tried before to show a realistic Africa in Trader Horn, but the cost was prohibitive and the film never recouped the expense of making it, especially during the Depression. Audiences after World War II wanted a little more realism in their cinema. Fantasy they got from that machine they starting staring into in 1947 in their living rooms.They also selected an excellent book to film. H. Rider Haggard had spent some years in the British Colonial Service in Africa. He was a pretty good observer of what was around him, even though his writing is tinged with the white man's burden attitude so common in the 19th Century. The film is not a faithful adaption of Haggard's work, but it's pretty close to it. Deborah Kerr is a woman looking to hire Stewart Granger who's the best reputed guide in Africa. She's looking for her husband, not sure if he's dead or alive. Granger agrees to take her on safari along with one of her husband's friends played by Richard Carlson.This allows for a certain amount of sexual tension between Granger and Kerr and in fact the two of them had an extra marital affair. Carlson's part is essentially colorless. I think he's along mainly to provide a sounding board for Kerr and her changing attitudes about Africa and Granger.The jungle photography is fabulous, the film is worth it for that alone. Granger and Kerr create some good characterizations and the native Africans are good in their roles.King Solomon's mines had such an impact that even the later Tarzan films had a more realistic look about them. An absolutely must see item.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Adventure; Unpretentious, Epic in Feel, Plus a Mature Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this production was mounted for Stewart Granger, with Deborah Kerr and Richard Carlson as his co-stars, no one could have imagined how imitated, influential and important the film would become. It has an epic quality about it that is earned by African on-site locales, fine cinematography and direction of the film, and the discovery-aspect of the narrative as the participants learn along about a fascinating continent and its people with the viewers. H. Rider Haggard's venerable novel find to b a curious mixture of Victorian angst, adventure, romance, mystery evoked by an expedition storyline. The fine acting by Stewart Granger as Alan Quartermain the white hunter, Deborah Kerr as a woman seeking her missing husband, Richard Carlson as her brother, and Hugo Haas as a back-sliding villain works exceptionally to increase the believability of the film. The simplest incident on this dangerous expedition--sitting down in the wrong place, turning over a leaf, wearing the wrong weight or textile of garment, cutting one's hair, hearing a sound, anything--can trigger a learning or a dangerous experience... This was a lavish MGM production, with participation by legendary artists and technicians such as Cedric Gibbons as art director, Edwin B. Willis as set decorator, Robert Surtees as cinematographer, Douglas Shearer in charge of sound and many others. But the real star of the film apart from the actors is Andrew Marton and Compton Bennett's realization of Helen Deutsch's interesting modernization of the original novel. Wjite hunter Alan Quartermain does not really care to live any longer; he has just seen one of his best "boys" die in a hunting accident, having been hired to please a bloodthirsty imperial's whim to kill wildlife; and Deborah Kerr comes along just then in need of a guide, trying to convince herself that she still cares about the cold husband who disappeared in search of a fabled treasure, the gold mines of King Solomon of Israel.. Obviously the two are ready to fall in love during the dangerous search for her lost mate, one that takes them into unknown country, among dangerous tribes, and into adventures that include helping a deposed seven-foot-tall monarch regain his throne by a rite of combat, incidentally saving their lives in the process. The most exciting sequence in the film is a grass fire that causes animals to stampede toward the expedition, who must taken shelter crouched low behind a makeshift low barrier; it has been imitated, never duplicated, and was later used in several other films. The film is occasionally leisurely, never dull; its makers play with time very intelligently. For once, the viewer gets the sense in a film of an arduous trek, of time passing, time for changes to happen and motivations for the same. The actors are grand, especially the mature intelligent leads; all-in-all, this simple storyline in the right hands was turned into what is all-but-universally acknowledge to be a classic adventure-romance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A trek into Africa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The wonderful book by H. Rider Haggard "King Salomon's Mines" was beautifully adapted for the screen by Helen Deutsch. The film entirely shot in Africa has a lot going for it in Robert Surtees excellent cinematography. This is a film that is good for viewing by all ages, but young minds will probably will find it more to their taste because of the long trek the three principals take into the unknown.This film boasts two directors, Compton Bennett and Andrew Marton! The film is set in Africa. At the beginning of the film we watch Allan Quattermain who is guiding a group in a safari and a herd of elephants come near and one is killed. We watch in horror as the others rally around the dead animal in an almost human display of emotions.Quartermain is contacted by Elizabeth Curtis, a woman that wants to locate her husband who has come to the region in search of the legendary diamond mines of King Solomon's. He is reluctant, but since she meets his price, the excursion is organized. What Mrs. Curtis, or Quartermain, or even the third member of the mission, Jack Goode, don't realize at the outset of the trip is what they are in for! The trek turns into one of the most extraordinary adventures ever filmed. Some of the scenes involving wild animals are incredible. In fact, some of the things this party has to deal with are amazing. Especially impressive is the stampede sequence when one watch in horror how all these wild animals are running amok.Stewart Granger is Quartermain, the jaded Englishman living in that remote spot. He loves it there and would never go back to his country. Mr. Granger was perfect for this type of film in which he clearly excelled. Deborah Kerr plays the English lady in search for her husband. She sticks out like a sore thumb, but in the end, she proves to have a strength we didn't give her credit for. Ms. Kerr was always a good in whatever she undertook. Richard Carlson makes a good contribution to the film.The different natives shown in their own habitat add veracity to the movie. The tall Watusi tribe is the most exotic one we have seen in any films of this type.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of the '50s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film follows an excellent hunter (Granger) who is payed to go on a safari to find the lost husband of Deborah Kerr and Richard Carlson. He reluctantly agrees. Along the way they run into different perils. Including many tribes that want the group dead. The film is very exciting. And you feel for the characters when they come into contact with danger. I wish more action films could make you do that. The performances are the reason behind this. It's too bad that the actors and actresses in the film weren't nominated for Oscars. I doubt they deserved to win, but they deserved to be up. The script is also very good. It strays away from the book just a little bit. But I have no problem with that because the film, by itself, is very good. The cinematography and editing are flawless. And they rightly won Oscars. The film was also nominated for Best Picture. It's one of the better adventure films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This colorful outdoor story is great entertainment and has excellent work by Stewart Granger and Deborah Kerr. The spare plot involves a search for a woman's missing husband which leads eventually to a diamond mine in a distant province. The safari braves assorted dangers along the way from wild animals and savage tribesmen, and the film captures the beautiful vistas of the African plains and exotic animals in their natural habitat. Richard Carlson is along as a member of the safari, as are two natives who provide fine characterizations as the plot unfolds. This picture doesn't have a music score but does have instead the drums and chants of the tribesmen that provide an authentic accompaniment to the film. Robert Surtees received an Academy Award for his excellent cinematography for this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rousing adaptation lavishly produced by Sam Zimbalist about H. Rider Haggard's classic adventure novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The screenplay follows the British version by Robert Stevenson but the screenwriter Helen Deutsch changed the plot, as introducing a female character, the brotherhood relationship for matrimonial relation and eliminating the fantastic elements. Two English actors starred, Stewart Granger as the famous Allan Quatermain and Deborah Kerr as Elizabeth Curtis, hiring the great white hunter and accompanied by her brother John performed by Richard Carlson. At the time was announced as starring Errol Flynn , though he renounced for performing 'Kim' by Victor Saville. The safari led by Stewart Granger set out in search for her husband and the king Salomon's treasure mines. The brave hunter and the elegant lady become fast friends, confronting risks and danger in search of legendary diamonds mines.The African native is played by a real Watusi ethnic, Sinaque, reclaiming his rights over throne.In 1937 version was the supreme role performed by the singer Paul Robeson who proved his singing faculties.The filming started in Africa 1949, running time five months. The crew travelled by hundred miles in planes and trucks across Kenia, Uganda, Congo Belgian, Lagoon Victory, Falls of Murchisin and north of lagoon Tanganika where live the Watusi. Polished and coloristic production design by the veteran Cedric Gibbons. Heat and ills affected the crew and main actors but Deborah Kerr surprised for her resistance. There had confronting between Stewart Granger and Compton Bennett and Andrew Marton directed the second unity. Then, Metro Goldwyn Mayer dismissed Compton and Marton finished the picture. It was nominated for best movie and won Academy Award for cinematography by Robert Surtees and edition. Had several take-out with no use and later Metro Goldwyn Mayer utilized for its follow-up.The picture is followed by a sequel, rapidly made, created with excess footage previous, titled 'Watusi'(1959) by Kurt Neumann with George Montgomery and David Farrar. An inferior version directed by J.Lee Thompson(1985) with Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone; and a TV adaptation directed by Steven Boyum with Patrick Swayze and Alison Doody, among others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Solomon's Mines and two others that are classics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are three classic movies about early colonial Africa. 'Trader Horn'; starring Harry Cary; 'King Solomons Mines'; Granger - Kerr and 'Out of Africa'; Redford - Streyp. In the first two, old Africa was available, in the last it was not. The Technicolour and acting of the 'Mines' was fantastic!, although many don't realize that the scenes of the cavernous mines were filmed in Carlsbad Nat'l. Park and the trek into the great desert before the Kalahari region was actually White Sands New Mexico. The romantic wonderment of Granger washing Kerr's hair at Murchison Falls was copied quite nicely by Redford and Streyp. The green hills of the Watusi highlands were copied nicely in Karen Blixens Nygong Hills estate. It will be some time before another film comes out to match the beauty and majesty of colonial Africa like the 'Mines' and 'Out of Africa'. Until then, these two stand alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stewert Granger was never more imposing as a leading man, Deborah Kerr was never more beautiful as she was under the African sky and Africa was never more scenic or more deadly . This was like something out of the Boys Own annual and while connoisseurs of the book might complain about the total lack of similarity between this film and H Rider Haggard's classic, to us lesser mortals this film has the ability to take us to a different world.A world of sun ,sand and deadly creatures. So some of the animals may not have even been from Africa and the deadly spider was obviously straight out of the prop cupboard but seeing a lot of the animals in their natural habitat made up for this and the stampede scene literally took my breath away. I spent a large part of my life in Africa and this film made me quite homesick and the African music before the credits actually bought tears to my eyes. I caught this film on TCM in their weekend matinée slot and I just want to conclude by saying thank you TCM for another bit of marvellous movie magic. King Solomans Mines 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>H. Rider Haggard's classic story about African adventurer/guide Allan Quartermain, who after agreeing to search for Elizabeth Curtis' missing husband. Finds himself on the trail of the fabled diamond mines of King Solomon.A road movie in African locations? Well yes it is, but if exotic locations and jungle japery is your thing? Then King Solomon's Mines is the film for you. MGM shelled out a then staggering $3.5 million to make this piece, and not a penny is wasted as it's one of the finest productions from the adventure genre. Robert Surtees rightly bagged the Academy Award for his cinematography, the jungle, mountains and swamps all brought vividly to life by the adroit Surtees. Yet as good as it is technically, and as epic as Haggard's source is, the film still doesn't quite reach the heights to compliment the other aspects.It's not so much the cast, who had to contend with searing heat and numerous jungle infections, it's just the characters they play are plain and uninteresting. The burgeoning romance between Stewart Granger's Quartermain and Debora Kerr's Curtis is fine, and helps the trip zip along, but they are devoid of expression, secondary to the scenery around them. Granger {stepping in after Errol Flynn dropped out} does look the part of an adventurer, but a hint of heroism is badly missing, while Kerr plays the prim mistress act as if in her sleep. It's almost as if the technical aspects of the film took precedence over character substance, and that's a shame because this should have been a total benchmark for the action/adventure genre.Unusually for films around this era, the African tribes are afforded respect, and actually are the most interesting characters on show, and although a whiff of imperialism is hard to ignore, it never suffocates the actual story, mainly because of the air of daftness that is driving it all along. It's basically a technically excellent film {fake creatures aside} that sadly underachieves on its human characterisations. But with that said, now comes my disclaimer that it's a film I have constantly revisited over the years, I get a kick out of it, as I'm sure many others do. If only they had..........well I can't go on about it can I? 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the best "african trek" movie ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really love this movie. It has an intelligent script with none of the goofy inconsistencies that make most African trek movies so awful. And for once the safari does not include a bad guy who tries to sabotage everything.All the actors are good, but I think this may be Stewart Granger's best role. He gives real feeling to the "burned out" safari guide character and is totally believable. A young Richard Carlson and Deborah Kerr perform well too.It's based on an H. Rider Haggard story, but improves on the book by simplifying the climax so it'll fit in a movie. For once the movie re-write is actually better than the book it's based on.But what is most surprising about this movie is how real everything is. When they show natives, they are actually African tribes. When they need Watusi's, they film in Watusi-land! Even the animal scenes fit smoothly into the flow. You NEVER get the feeling that the stars are in a studio and some African footage has been spliced in behind them.The adventure builds to an exciting and believable climax, so you won't be disappointed. I think this may be the best such safari-trek movie ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good, but of its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>H Rider Haggard was a visionary author. He wrote a series of Africa-based fantasy and adventure novels which took his Victorian audience into the most exotic places - even when those places were real (and they weren't always!) they were totally outside the experience of the reader.This 1950 film adaptation of one of those novels has the same sort of impact on its pre-TV cinema audience. Although it takes a number of liberties with Haggard's source material, it delivers action, adventure, colour, and exotic locations to an audience which was, for the most part unfamiliar with the African locations used here.Watching it now, 60 years later, it still entertains although it now comes over as rather on the quaint side. The TV generations are now only too familiar with locations all over the globe, so what was once eye-catchingly different is now somewhat familiar (although still quite eye-catching).Where this film is still unusual is in its use of Masai in acting roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>H. Ryder Haggard's adventure tale has been transposed to the screen with professional polish, given authentic African locales for all the background color, and uses no music on the soundtrack except for the chants of African tribes. As such, it's a stunning film to look at in gorgeous Technicolor and nicely played by STEWART GRANGER as the burnt by the sun Safari guide and DEBORAH KERR in another of her prim leading lady roles.Kerr is actually seeking the best of guides so she can hunt for her husband, so she takes along her good friend RICHARD CARLSON. Naturally, a romantic attachment to Granger gradually develops once Kerr starts to melt under the African sun.All of the scenes involving actual native tribes are beautifully staged and handled with a sense of excitement and adventure, as are the scenes of wild animals. But it's basically a showcase for MGM's new property, Miss Kerr, and their new leading man, Mr. Granger.It kept fans happy when it opened at New York's Radio City Music Hall in the summer of '50, but today it's largely forgotten among the many gems that came out that year. It did win a couple of Oscars, one for the beautiful color cinematography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one remains a classic in the history of the adventure film genre. I first saw it in the early 60's. As a child, the scenes of animals in their natural habitat and peoples of African cultures made a big impression. These are still worth seeing today, especially since the film has been restored. I bought the VHS version in the 1980's and the restoration wasn't so good. Too much blue and brown like colorized versions of B&amp;W films. It was on t.v. about a month ago and the color was much better. Although the plot is predictable, the visual effects are still worth it 56 years later. Granger is a bit heavy-handed as the "great white hunter", especially in one scene where he peremptorily waves his hand for the "natives" to fall in and follow when he is not, in fact, in charge of the action being portrayed. Based on this film, I used to think Richard Carlson was British, not from the U.S.! My favorite scenes are of the men dancing in the Watusi village enclosure, and the hand-to-hand combat scene where Umbopa and his usurper cousin fight it out for the throne.A bit of trivia: The music played at the beginning and end of the film is the exact same music played in the film "Mogambo".</fullReview>

Based on the Haggard novel, this is just a good, old-fashioned adventure yarn. Granger makes a dashing hero, although it's not clear why the 37-year-old actor was made up to look about 20 years older in the film. Kerr is well cast as the prim and proper lady who struggles to battle the elements. Carlson is also good as Kerr's brother. Filmed on location, it looks authentic not only in terms of the setting but also in the utilization of native tribes people. Also adding to the atmosphere is a soundtrack featuring only jungle sounds.</fullReview>

It stemmed less from the story or the acting of the principals as from the environment and context of the film, set as it was in east Africa. I believe this film to be one of the first to be shot virtually entirely on location in Africa, and the results are stunning. Shots of stampedes that are clearly not drawn from stock footage are awesome, but even more gripping are the scenes of the Masai and Kikuyu tribespeople, playing themselves and doing so absolutely unselfconsciously. The tribal dancing of these magnificent people is moving (and at times terrifying). I understand that in filming them it was terrifying for cast and crew as well, for the spearthrowing got out of hand, at one point driving Deborah Kerr up a tree! In any case, this version of "King Solomon's Mines" is one for the ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, Rare Color Footage of African Villagers etc</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1950's version of King Solomon's Mines is unusual in a couple ways. First, there's no symphonic music score whatsoever. Film music is typically used to tell us what we as the audience should feel about activity on screen, and also tell us what the characters themselves are supposedly feeling. In this way both audience and characters share the same emotional reactions. Music on film is such a common and natural expectation (or substitute?) for an audience's emotions, that some reviewers here think the movie was bland and boring!Secondly, the MGM crew of about 30 people and 7 cargo trucks spent months in 1949 filming this on the Dark Continent itself, at locations hundreds of miles from civilization in eastern Africa instead of the usual Hollywood lots. They enlisted the inhabitants of remote villages as actors, asked them to perform communal dances, and took many close-up shots of their faces, hair, headgear, jewelry and body paint. This amounts to some of the most magnificent - and rare - color and sound footage of "old" untouched African culture I've seen. Not long after this, during the 1950's-1960's these villages gradually became part of the modern world, and by the 1980's, remote tribesmen were filmed as they hunted with spears - wearing "Michael Jackson" t- shirts.The movie is generally pretty good, but the Africans steal the show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A little old-fashioned by today's standards but still a watchable and entertaining dramatisation of H Rider Haggard's popular adventure which seems to borrow rather a lot from the story of David Livingstone's discovery by Stanley.There aren't a great deal of bona-fide action sequences to speak of but the mystery of missing explorer Curtis's disappearance and the deepening of Stewart Granger's relationship with the missing man's wife Deborah Kerr, all set against an authentic African backdrop and their interaction with a variety of indigent tribesmen, keep the viewer interested.The leads play off each other well within the confines of their stereotypical roles, Granger the commanding, aloof adventurer Quatermain and Kerr the initially starchy but also feisty Englishwoman abroad. Unfortunately she typifies the clichéd image of representing the weaker sex by screaming, fainting and falling down rather a lot. Richard Carlson is however very good as Kerr's common-sense brother.The film location camera-work is generally good, particularly the night shots in the desert although there are, not surprisingly, a fair number of reaction shots of the leads intercut into scenes of danger and a fair number of not always successful process shots too. The local natives are happily given plenty of screen time, speaking in their own tongue more often than not, which adds a little to attempted authenticity.It winds its way to a, being honest, less than nail-biting conclusion but in these days of C-Gen backgrounds, it was good to see this adventure in natural settings, although I'm willing to bet a fair number of animals were harmed in the production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a Treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember the movie played in our little town's premier theatre to considerable fanfare? See Darkest Africa As It Really Is in Dramatic Technicolor!? you know, that sort of thing. In fact it was a treat to see all the wild animals and fearsome natives, plus an exciting adventure story. I expect MGM made back its expenses and then some.Of course, that was before TV brought the world into living rooms everywhere. The movie may have lost that long ago novelty, but it's still a good story set in what was then colonial Africa, with a first-rate cast, including the exotic Umbopa, the prince in exile. Then there's that thundering stampede whose mighty numbers still impress.Like many reviewers, I cringe now at the elephant kill. I'm sure I didn't at the time, but then this ecological type change reflects a newer awareness, and one I think for the better. Actually, Quartermain (Stewart) is also bothered by big game kills, one reason he's ready to give up his hunting safaris.Happily, Stewart's persuasive as the experienced white man, while Kerr does nicely as the British gentlewoman able to adapt her well-bred ways. (However, MGM, ever the glamour studio, refuses to de-glamorize her no matter how rough the going). I do feel a little sorry for tag-along John (Carlson) who, nevertheless, hangs in there. On the other hand, I'm still curious about the van Brun (Haas) role. Was that episode in the book or was it added to diversify and perhaps pad the storyline.No, those old promotionals about Africa in Color wouldn't work now. But the movie's still an eyeful with a good adventure yarn and a fine cast, and those are film features that do endure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Picturesque Travelogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The setting: East Africa, 1897. Macho safari guide and hunter Alan Quatermain (Stewart Granger), offered a generous down payment of five thousand pounds, reluctantly decides to assist Elizabeth Curtis (Deborah Kerr) in finding her missing husband. But Quatermain is not confident that a woman can undertake what will be a perilous journey into the interior. Mr. Curtis had left his home several years earlier in order to find King Solomon's diamond mines in darkest (uncharted) Africa. Why Mrs. Curtis wants to find him is that she takes on some responsibility because of her less-than-decent treatment of him. She tells Quatermain that she is independently wealthy, unlike her husband, and that she still loves him (!). She even has a hand-drawn map of Curtis' trek. Yet these types of movies, where the wife is trying to find her long-lost beau, send a signal that you just know the missing dude isn't going to be worth it. So the movie develops into a love story between the two leads. Accompanying the two is Mrs. Curtis' loyal brother John (Richard Carlson). A key player is seven-foot tall and lean Umbopa (Siriaque) of the Watusi tribe. After fifty minutes of the movie have passed, he joins the expedition out of nowhere. Unassuming for most of the film's remainder, he has a significant moment at the end. By the way, the indigenous cultures are treated with deference, and the natives get significant screen time.We see many wonderful wild animals, including elephants, rhinos, lions, and leopards. But the expedition is fraught with all kinds of difficult situations: dangerous snakes (black Mamba, cobra, and others), an unfriendly native tribe, and a massive stampede of zebras, giraffes and gazelles. Then there are unpredictable bearers who later desert, stealing much of the supplies. Despite the setting of the story, it is nice to see that our hero Quatermain shuns the indiscriminate shooting of animals. Africa is a beautiful place, but one has to be tough to live there. After learning about the fate of Curtis, our heroes are trapped in a cave-mine without food. At the denouement there is an exciting three-minute duel between two men: a usurper of the tribal throne and the legitimate king. This clash really is not much different than that of a USA western setting with two dudes fighting it out, one good and one bad. If the bad guy wins, then it will be an undesirable ending for the few survivors of the expedition.This movie is an enjoyable adventure story with tense situations, and is nicely edited and acted throughout. Although Deborah Kerr is often frightened and has nightmares, remember that she is supposed to be proper and unsuspecting of a safari's hardships. The photography is magnificent! On-location shooting is always a plus, even if supplemented by such places as California and New Mexico. But there is no stock footage in this feature! Yes, Africa is the real star. In its day the film must have been a real eye-opener.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark Continent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie marked the end of Africa as the Dark Continent, as it was seen in the 19th century. In the movies of the period, there were always blank spots on the map -- Terra Incognita and Hereabouts There Be Dragons. The movies treated Africa as a kind of theme park designed for viewers who had only seen lions and giraffes in the zoo, if they saw them at all. "King Solomon's Mines", like the films that preceded it, contain a kind of colorful travelogue in which the narrator -- here, the protagonist Stewart Granger as the Great White Hunter -- explains to us what we're about to see."And now the natives in their colorful garb celebrate a religious ritual with an exotic dance. Afterward they sit down to a feast. The fact that the roast gnu still has hair on it doesn't seem to interfere with their appetites!" After "The African Queen" this Dark Continent model more or less disappeared from the screen. There wasn't a single lion or rhinoceros in "The African Queen," and the worst living menace that Bogart and Hepburn faced were an apparently limitless cloud of biting gnats.Yet, "King Solomon's Mines" is more than just a travelogue. That old-fashioned element is gotten out of the way rather quickly, and what follows is a tip-top adventure story of a long and dangerous journey in search of a missing husband and a fortune in diamonds -- and the "natives" are treated with respect.It was a popular picture in its time. I was sick and missed the class visit to its premier at Radio City Music Hall. It's well acted, as well as nicely plotted. Stewart Granger is a disillusioned white guide who manages to sport a nice Malibu sun tan. His melodious and theatrical voice was impressive. Deborah Kerr in, I think, her first American film is breath-takingly beautiful in a winsome way that makes you want to take care of her between nuzzles. Richard Carlson is his standard screen persona with a slight British accent.The novel on which the film is based was written by H. Rider Haggard, 1856 to 1925, who had lived in South Africa and knew how to write cracking good adventure stories. I was addicted to them in adolescence. This was perhaps his most popular; this and "She", which gave us the phrase, "She who must be obeyed," which I don't like to remember because it reminds me of my marriage. I read some of Haggard's work more recently and -- well, I think it helps to be a teen ager to get the most out of them.The location shooting was done partly in Africa, most of it by a second-unit crew, and it's convincingly African -- even the parts that were shot in California.The film was hugely popular in 1950 and it's worth watching now because it still glows with some of the old magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Grandeur of Africa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a Valentine to the beauty of Africa where the majority of it was filmed. A trip through jungle, desert and snow-capped mountains....it's a virtual travelogue. Adding to the joy of this film is a strong cast and a rousing story that keeps your attention.Stewart Granger is perfect as the somewhat jaded "great white hunter" who is talked into what seems to him a fruitless trip to uncharted territory in search of the lost husband of Deborah Kerr. Along for the ride is Richard Carlson as her brother, although he doesn't have a lot to do. Deborah of the flaming hair seems a little out of place in the beginning of the film but toughens up as the search continues.One of the joys of the film is the magnificence of the African players....they have great dignity and unusual beauty. The scenario in the Watusi village is a highlight of the story.Needless to say, the missing husband is found but can no longer prove a threat to the happiness of Granger and Kerr who have fallen in love on the trek. Richard Carlson is still around and still has nothing to do but I guess he made a good chaperone.This is a do-not-miss film which offers a look at the "dark continent" and plenty of thrills for the adventure fan. It deserves a little more attention than it has gotten over the years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Unique Film is Some Aspects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The MGM 1950 version of King Solomon's Mines is unusual in that it is an adventure story with no musical score whatever, other than some background drums and singing. Having seen it perhaps 15 times in the 1950s, I can say that it was always fresh, and just as scary in the tense parts every time seen on the big screen. The photography is just exceptional. The scenes of unspoiled African countryside in color should be cherished. An unfortunate part is the early scene with the actual shooting of a bull African elephant; but folks didn't know better then. I am pleased that the picture is now available on DVD, though the quality of image isn't perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrific film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fine film, which won Oscars for Best Cinematography &amp; Best Film Editing, it was also nominated for Best Picture. Filmed in spectacular locations/panoramas in an Africa that likely no longer exists with excellent actors and native tribepersons, there is much to appreciate. But despite its story and thrilling moments, it's likely to be a bit slow for the MTV/Attention Deficit Disorder generation/s. The only thing that bothers me about this film -- and it's significant -- is that it does NOT follow the book, which is actually more exciting and interesting even though (or because it's) sans the obligatory formulaic Hollywood-added love interest, which was for purposes of revenue-enhancing demographics, I assume!? It is an excellent family film! But will a writer/director like Peter Jackson PLEASE a film of this BOOK (and its excellent sequel, which has grand dramatic battle sequences, btw!) please!??? Someone mentioned it seemed almost like a documentary. H. Rider Haggard was a British Gov't official in Africa for *many* years, so he knew that of which he wrote, although he obviously romanticized some elements and/or stories (such as "She"). He did for adventure novels what Edgar Allan Poe did for detective novels! And if you do get/choose to read his books, get the UNabridged versions by HIM; some of the editions are truly horrible "translations"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film made in East Africa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This can be considered another film of adventure. However, it is different because it has been made completely in areas of former British colonies, Uganda, Tanganyika and Kenya, particularly in Rift Valley. Fauna shown here is still available in certain places of this African area, but not everywhere as it is in this film made in 1949-50. The other characteristic is that several tribes, particularly the Masai one, acted here and gave some ideas of their dances and rituals. In addition, violence from white people to black one is nearly absent. Therefore although old film it is interesting for those who are curious to know something of Africa</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hasn't this trip been penance enough?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was fairly clear to me that Elizabeth Curtis (Deborah Kerr) had no real intention of finding her husband once the expedition started. The only thing we needed to learn was why and it was answered about mid-way through - she didn't love him and treated him badly, so it was guilt all along that provided her motivation. The story would have been helped out if all those tentative glances between Quatermain (Stewart Granger) and Ms. Curtis were acted upon more deliberately, but the chemistry between the two actors never did seem to gel for me, even though they reportedly did carry on an affair for a time.Considering all the misery endured by the trio of adventurers during their trek, I would have expected the reveal of King Solomon's fortune to be a bit more lavish. What was that - a crate of colored glass? One was led to believe that there would be an entire cave filled with gems to make the expedition worthwhile, even if the original explorer was never found. Man, I had a chuckle over that one.I don't know, it's not often my summary line can also be used to characterize a movie but I think it fits. Notwithstanding the excellent cinematography, the film just didn't seem to offer a spark for this viewer. The Watusi actually had a name for it - 'yeer saba'. It describes a pointless, endless game.

		<fullReview>King Solomon's Mines is the second of the five film adaptations of the novel by Henry Rider Haggard.It stars Deborah Kerr, Stewart Granger and Richard Carlson. Granger portrayed the fearless-explorer Alan Quartermaine, and Kerr was the spunky Irish lass who hires him on to locate her husband. Compton Bennett and Andrew Marton directed this 1950 film.This was definitely an expensive remake of the classic film when it was released many years ago.The African scenery was something to behold.It was also an exciting and slam bang action film from beginning to end.Added to that,this could also be enjoyed by the whole family if seen today.Overall,this is definitely an adventure classic and remains one of the best adaptation of the Haggard's novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realistic African adventure with Stewart Granger and Deborah Kerr</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"King Solomon's Mines" tells the story of a woman (Deborah Kerr) and her brother (Richard Carlson) who hire a white hunter (Stewart Granger) in central Africa in the late 1800s to track down her missing husband who went in search of the fabled mines.It should be understood that this classic 1950 adventure film is just that ? a realistic adventure film and not an action movie, although there are some brief action scenes, of course. I say "realistic" in the sense that the story is taken seriously; there's no Tarzan or Indiana Jones and practically everything that happens is within the realm of possibility.The film was shot in central Africa ? Congo, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania ?with desert scenes shot at Death Valley and nearby Lone Pine, CA, and the cave scenes at Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico. The locations are incredible, to say the least, but the desert scenes beg the question: What desert did they run into in the jungles of central Africa? The only possible answer is that they went so far south they hit the Kalahari Desert.Like I said, this is a realistic adventure film (there's a slight romantic subplot but it's hardly worth mentioning). As such, be prepared for a cool hike into remotest Africa and the various fascinating tribes and animals thereof. Some criticize the film for showcasing too many animals, as if it's a zoological tour as much as a story, but the film was shot in 1949 and deepest Africa was still a mystery to the average person outside of Africa, which is why it's known as the "dark continent." Speaking of which, this was before Western Civilization reached (or infected) all the tribes in the interior and so the tribespeople appear authentic. If you were to go there today you'd see them walking around with tennis shoes, jeans and AC/DC shirts.Speaking of authenticity, the filmmakers made the wise decision to omit a conventional score and utilized percussion-oriented tribal music. This keeps the film from being unnecessarily dated with one of those horrible old-fashioned scores from the period.As far as the tribespeople go, the towering Watutsi are magnificent and the sequences at their awesome kingdom are a highlight.Lastly, you have to take into consideration that the story is condensed into a 103-minute time frame and certain segments of the story take much longer than shown, like the cavern sequence or the hike across the desert. The filmmakers obviously didn't want the film to bog down with overlong sequences.BOTTOM LINE: This is a great film for when you're in the mood for a realistic old-fashioned African adventure without Tarzan, Cheeta or Indiana Jones. Granger stands out as the uber-masculine hunter and Kerr is striking as the adamant redhead, but she's revealed as too weak at times, which isn't cool today.GRADE: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has all the trappings of a Travelogue through Africa while selling a very interesting version of Rider Haggard's novel. Sure they have changed so much from the Book, that to compare the two is a bit of a waste of time, for example no woman in the novel to one playing a major part in the Movie - so what? The story takes a long time to develop while I am sure just about every kind of African animal is shown along the way, but all the time there is great interest in what is happening. The cast is very good with Granger and Kerr leading, and Richard Carlson is a welcome addition, but in my opinion the stars of the film (other that the animals) are the leading African tribesmen, and the Watussi scenes are very memorable. This film is well worth seeing, and ignore the obvious impossibilities in the script and enjoy the grandeur of such a fascinating country.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to see one of the most awful and wince-inducing films of the 1980s, try watching the Richard Chamberlain version of this movie. I don't recommend it...unless you have a very strong stomach and a bit of a masochist within you! However, just because this film was a god-awful mess of a comedy does not mean this 1950 version or any of the other versions are at all like this newer film. The other "King Solomon's Mines" are NOT comedies but rousing adventure stories.One of the biggest pluses of this version is that it was actually filmed in Africa--just like the exceptional 1937 version. Because of that it lacks the studio-bound look of most other African savanna films of the age. Plus, there is none of the usual crappy stock footage (which, in many films show Asian and South American animals--in Africa!). No, MGM pulled out the stops for this one--filming it in color and on location. And, unlike the (yuck) 1985 version, no cannibal stew pots filled with plastic veggies and African explorers! Allan Quatermain (Stewart Granger) is a famous African hunter and guide. He is about ready to retire when he's approached by Elizabeth (Deborah Kerr) and her good friend John (Richard Carlson). It seems that Elizabeth's husband went to Africa some time back and is assumed lost or dead--she wants Quatermain to guide them in search of this lost man. However, the whole expedition seems entirely too dangerous--especially with a woman coming along with them. So, Quatermain is difficult to convince...until they offer him a huge fee. On the way, there are lots of adventures, death and mystery. Ultimately, they learn that the missing man was in search of King Solomon's supposedly mythical treasure. I could say more but don't want to spoil the fun.Apart from a VERY cheesy tarantula early in the film, this is an excellent film. It's better than the 1937 version in two ways--it's in lovely color and Quatermain's associates aren't dumb! But, the first film was more original and was blessed by the dynamic presence of Paul Robeson. Overall, I'd say they are both about equal.</fullReview>

Wonderful for its time, I guess, but doesn't really hold up for today's audiences. I still enjoyed it for what it is. The stampede scene was, however, pretty darn good. I have no idea how they got that to happen especially with so many different kinds of animals. What made me laugh, though, was the giant spider. It was so fake.

		<fullReview>Alan Quartermain(Stewart Granger) is a White Hunter.The very term is abhorrent to many people today,but it was a perfectly acceptable profession in colonial Africa.In many ways he is a man ahead of his time.He respects wildlife and will kill only when he is compelled to.He does have rather a paternalistic attitude towards Africans - as was common amongst whites - but he respects and understands their culture. Amongst his contemporaries he is the Bwana di tutti Bwanas,the man with the big rep.When Miss Deborah Kerr's husband disappears it is only natural that she should turn to him for help. Mr Quartermain is no saint,he clearly fancies Miss Kerr from the start and his initial reluctance to set out to find he husband is quickly overcome when she offers him silly money to do the job. He is however a damn good man to have on a safari,handy with a rifle and has a shirt with neat sewed - in belts to keep his bullets and his pipe handy should the need for a shot or a smoke arise. It should come as a surprise to nobody that in the course of an arduous trip where they come across more wildlife than you would see on a good night on BBC 2,they fall in love. Mr Granger grits his teeth a lot and Miss Kerr has a tendency to faint when confronted by anything more aggressive than a Pekingnese but don't let that spoil your enjoyment of a super film. All moral considerations aside,this is a ripping yarn with superb photography,luscious colour,good performances and was influential for a generation of movie makers drawn to a fascinating and mysterious land. "Heart of Darkness" it isn't - nor does it aspire to be. Exciting and entertaining,enthralling and informing it is - and that should be enough for any one movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember this movie from when I was in middle school. What impact! Saw it with my uncle who was a local high school basketball coach and remember him saying "boy, wouldn't I like to have a couple of those tall guys (Watusi) playing for me. Sure looks like he wasn't alone, this movie may have been responsible for Dikembe Motumbo, etc. in the NBA, in a roundabout way. This movie may have been the first exposure to their existence for the majority of America. The plot really deviated from the book (read later) but not all that much from an artistic point of view. The book was written almost as a documentary, as I remember. Would have been quite boring and probably impossible to make or follow without some type of plot interest. The cinematography was the first thing that reached out and smacked you, from the opening credits with the name rolling across the screen through the unbelievable stampede scene (how the hell did they do that?) and all the way to the end. It may be true that some of the characters were a little weak and the plot was somewhat cheesy but come on!!! Whoever compares this to "Raiders" is probably too young to realize just what went into the making of the movie and forgets the technology advances and the fact that this was the first one, kind of set the standard. Absolutely no comparison... how can you compare the Mona Lisa to a photo of Julia Roberts? Give me a break!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great adventure film not much action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a pure adventure film as oppose to being an action/adventure film. It really doesn't have much action but it is a great travelogue to an Africa that is now vanishing. Since the movie was released in 1950 it was probably shot in '49 anyway what's on the screen is an Africa that was still relatively unspoiled by guerrilla warfare or modern times. Producers for the National Geographic channel could only wish to shoot such pristine beauty. But on to the film, the story is familiar, a Great White Hunter reluctantly agrees to guide a woman and her brother into the wilderness in search of her husband. Along the way they meet tribes, and we are shown some of the tribes doing ritual dances. Also we get to see the wonder of, I think, Victoria falls before it became a tourist spot. The pacing of the movie is rather leisurely there's no real action except for the stampede which I found very exhilarating. Stewart Granger looked good as Alan Quartermain and has a manly presence in the role, although I preferred Clark Gable in "Mogambo" as the Hollywood white hunter. Deborrah Kerr looked lovely and her make up looked perfect the entire time. Their acting tend to be a little flat, as a matter of fact the acting in general felt flat, although Miss Kerr did a good job showing concern and panic. Hers might be the best performance of the movie. The two main leads just didn't have the joy of performance that the two leads in "The African Queen" had. And as for the final fight scene between for the tribal throne. I don't expect Jackie Chan vs. Jet Li, but this fight seems to have been done by amateurs with maybe a half hour of rehearsal. A great adventure and travelogue with not much action, overall a good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Solomon's Mines (1950) is the greatest of all USA produced African movies, no exceptions!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Solomon's Mines (1950 MGM) starring Stewart Granger and Deborah Kerr is the greatest movie about modern day Africa ever filmed, even though it was set in 1898.It shows the grandeur and perfect culture (and satisfaction) of the local natives....it is not about politics or social revolution, to it's credit.This movie is about how beautiful, how perfect Africa at the Equator level, but elevated to heights which make it comfortable ("It's like England," states Deborah Kerr!), and about the fact that Africa is where all civilization and human origins occurred.It is still the perfect place to live, and this movie shows that.Hooray! The story is a dumb Hollywood version of much more intelligent (but discarded) version of the story written by H. Rider Haggard.Too expensive to film the Haggard story, so Hollywood in 1950 made a love story out of it, and who cares? The movie still came out perfect, perfect, perfect, and people should see it and reverence it.Hollywood does the best it can with modest resources, especially mental and intellectual resources.This movie turned out good.I loved it. Screen it often. You should also.------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

		<fullReview>While it could have done with more characterisation, King Solomon's Mines is a lively and beautifully photographed film. The cinematography and scenery is fabulous and the editing is crisp and Mischa Spolainsky's score is rousing and beautiful. The film goes along at a good pace, has a good script and has an engaging story full of animal action, frenzied tribesmen and sentimental love scenes. The direction from Compton Bennett and Andrew Marton is strong, while Stewart Granger is very likable and the lovely Deborah Kerr is watchable as she always was. In conclusion, a very good film worth seeing for the leads and the visuals. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely the best version of King Solomon's Mine that I have seen. Stewart Granger can do both the swashbuckling and the more intense bits as we discover who Quatermaine is, his insight into the reasons why this beautiful woman wants to go on a hazardous journey for example. This is also the closest version to the book, the main difference being the existence of a woman, beautifully played by Deborah Kerr, in the film, the book is a strictly all male affair.Watch out for the bit where Kerr cuts her long hair and it instantly goes into beautiful permed curls, the one great complaint I have about the film.Otherwise, sit back and enjoy two excellent hours of fun, swash and buckle and a bit of love thrown in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lot of Fainting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I put myself into the fifties to view this. In the little movie theater in our town, we frequently saw movies that were quite old. I saw this in about 1955. Having viewed it again after all these years, I find that it has a spark that many of the others of its ilk did not. It's the classic he-man putting up with the uncooperative woman and ultimately falling in love with her. But this is a lot more. Just the wonderful use of real African tribes, the humanizing of the people. Quatermain has great affection to those loyal to him and their loss almost drives him from the business of safari guide. There is great adventure, wonderful animal shots, and a believable trek into the unknown. I know that women were viewed differently but this constant fainting every time things got rough was a bit much. Some people go a lifetime without fainting. This is really a Victorian novel thing and not very believable. Of course, she'd pop up pretty quickly without any semblance of nausea or disorientation. Make her character stubborn and resistant, but not so quick to drop to the ground. Small point. Overall, this is a fun film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining romantic adventure.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1950 classic is a favorite of mine for many reasons.Not least of which is the pleasure of seeing the gorgeous Stewart Granger shirtless and oozing sex appeal out in the jungle.Directed by Compton Bennett and Andrew Marton with a screenplay by Helen Deutsch it's based on the well known adventure novel by H.Rider Haggard.It tells the story of famous hunter and safari leader Allan Quartermain(Stewart Granger)who's a bit down on his luck.Until he is hired by wealthy and fiercely independent English woman Elizabeth Curtis(Deborah Kerr)to find her missing husband.After some strong objections from Quartermain including fears for her state of mind,concerning her determination to go through hell to find her husband,he agrees to her proposal that he be her guide through the vast jungle.They're joined by Elizabeths loyal brother John Goode(Richard Carleson)and many natives for the long trek towards the famed King Solomans mines(where her husband was last known to be heading).On the way they face much danger and hardship including wild animals,cannibals and there's a steady realisation of a growing attraction between Quartermain and Elizabeth.For me it's their relationship which makes this film a must see starting off as complete opposites and not the best of friends they gradually develop a touching relationship which is helped by the undeniable chemistry between Deborah and Stewart.Deborah sadly doesn't get much to do here except scream at animals and faint a lot but she is very good and compliments Grangers masculine tough guy perfectly.The highlight here though is Robert Surtees stunning cinematography and the breathtaking animal sequences including a stampede have to be seen to be believed.Although not a perfect film this is very enjoyable and has a good romance,adventure story with likable lead actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have seen the Indiana Jones films and expect rip roaring adventures then steer clear.Stewart Granger is in his element as a rather world weary game hunter who is offered a shed load of money from Deborah Kerr who wants to find her missing husband who went looking for treasure and has never returned.Although boasting extensive location footage that takes in the jungle, Savannah, desert and mountains not a lot happens but a lot of trekking some encounters with shifty white men, some shifty tribes and the usual wild animal and reptile escapades.There is a budding romantic subtext and maybe for the first time we see some authentic tribal music and dancing in a western mainstream film, although the choreography and editing of the final fight looks strange, as if the stunt coordinator seemed clueless as to stage manage a tribal fight scene.The film is credited with two directors because Granger fell out with the first one, but it certainly lacks action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice safari but weak adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a run-of-the-mill Hollywood production where the emphasis is on the colourful trip to inner Africa. The most interesting parts are clearly the tribes choreographies and the safari shots, which makes King Solomon's Mines OK as family entertainment, but makes the movie dull on the action side.With the difficulty to shoot on location most of the scenes it was a real challenge to do better than this flat continuity of talky scenes interspersed with beautiful shots of the African wildlife and local people. The story results quite boring: being a family movie it can't stem away from its clean line and thus you are only waiting for the prize in the title to materialise. And even then it is far from climactic since most of the movie has long before been let to tell a African story of its own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pathetic remake of a good movie that was made in 1937</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a bad remake of a very good movie that was made in 1937. The only advantage of this particular version is that it avoids the silly, comical aspects of the later versions. Most people who recommend this movie are comparing it to the more recent remakes, and most likely have never seen the 1937 version. The 1937 version tells an exciting story, and the acting is good. In this 1950 version, the plot is downplayed and becomes secondary to the romantic goings-on. Basically, it has been turned into a sort of soap opera set in Africa. Yeah, a lot of the scenery is good, but the special effects are not even as good as they are in the 1937 version, and the acting is deplorable. It is decidedly inferior to the 1937 version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A woman? A woman on safari?! No thank you!!" Allan Quatermain is about to learn a thing or two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Henry Curtis, an Englishman who arrived in Africa to search for the legendary King Solomon's mines, has not been heard from in two years. Now, in 1897, his wife, Elizabeth Curtis (Deborah Kerr), has arrived with her brother, John Goode (Richard Carlson), to find him. She will spare no expense, undertake any danger, to rescue her husband. Allan Quatermain (Stewart Granger), rugged, resourceful, decent and experienced, is just the big game hunter and old Africa hand she needs. It will take money, deposited up front, to overcome this widower's reluctance (he has a young son in England to provide for) to go on a dangerous wild goose chase. If her husband hasn't been heard of in two years, Quatermain tells Mrs. Curtis, he is undoubtedly dead. He also has doubts about her motives. They dislike each other on sight...but off into darkest Africa they go in one of Hollywood's grand adventure romances. The adventure part, for modern audiences, may seem a bit old fashioned. The trio encounter stampeding zebras, strange tribes, spiders the size of saucers, slimy centipedes, army ants, lions, crocodiles...and, as Quatermain points out to Elizabeth Curtis and her brother, in Africa human beings are just meat like every other animal. Still, the on-location color photography is nicely done. It might have been unusual in 1950 but it still holds up well nearly sixty years later. The whole concept of Africa at the turn of the century as a place of Victorian imagination and danger is hard not to enjoy. Africa was a place of lost cities, lost Roman legions, lost fabulous treasures, and even an ancient, forever-young queen who ruled without mercy -- a kind of 'she-who-must-really-be-obeyed' She, as Horace Rumpole might say. The romance part is handled with a great deal of charm. Elizabeth Curtis and Allan Quatermain find a good deal to bicker over, and bicker they do. Granger handles the he-man stuff with aplomb, and just as easily handles the back-and-forth with Kerr. It is Kerr, however, who brings delight to the movie. She's stuck with the requisite fainting and the turning away from death, but Kerr makes Elizabeth Curtis a woman with spine and character. Kerr shows us with subtlety how Curtis is beginning to learn from and enjoy her adventures, as frightening as they might seem at times. Her gradual appreciation of Quatermain is low key and endearing. Soon after King Solomon's Mines, MGM turned Deborah Kerr into a classic MGM-style lady. What a loss, although her skill and talent as an actress still shown through. For me, I'll remember Deborah Kerr best as Bridie Quilty in I See a Dark Stranger, Sister Clodagh in Black Narcissus and, much later, as Miss Giddens in The Innocents. For poignancy, see if you can spot Hugo Haas. He plays a seedy, dirty renegade in an isolated African village. It's not much of a part but he handles it well. Haas in the Thirties was a popular and celebrated star in Czechoslovakia. He acted, wrote, directed and produced. He was his own man. When the Nazis took over he had to flee and went to America. There, he was an unknown with no celebrity. He had to start over, not an auspicious thing for a portly, round-faced actor with a sharp nose. His name meant nothing. He made something of a reputation as a character actor in usually not-so-good movies. Haas used his money in the Fifties to start making his own movies, starring, writing and directing, just like the creative force he had been in Czechoslovakia. The movies, however, were just cheap quickies, reeking of lurid story lines. He died in 1968, his reputation in tatters, homesick and depressed. Just for nostalgia, go to Youtube and type in Hugo Haas and look for the clips from his 1935 movie At Zije Neboztik. You'll find one with Haas in evening dress at the bar of a posh club. He sings/acts that great song "Me To Tady Nebavi." (No, I don't know what it means.) Hugo Haas could be very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deborah Kerr has a hideous wig through the first part of "Solomon's Mines." You know by the time they find the diamonds the wig will be gone. At one point Deborah takes a scissors to it and gives herself a perfect haircut. That was my favorite scene. People in movies can always cut their own hair without it looking like a disaster. I also liked how whenever Deborah screamed Stewart Granger would come running into her tent with his shirt off. Her brother, played Richard Carlson, always had his shirt on, but then he wasn't the romantic lead. Carlson, who was born in Albert Lea Minnesota, didn't attempt to sound the least bit British too. I guess he figured he'd let Granger and Kerr do their thing and stay out of their way. The movie sort of fizzles to a conclusion. It's like everyone forgot that King Solomon's Mines were filled with diamonds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem I had with this film is that it can't seem to make up its mind whether it's an adventure story or a travelogue. The director pads the film with pictures of every conceivable African beast, and some glorious scenery, but the story is weak, and the romantic development is of the highest cliché factor imaginable. (And unfortunately, many of the spliced-in animal scenes were obviously filmed by different crews or just borrowed from someone else's film.)Anyone who has sat through INDIANA JONES or even ROMANCING THE STONE will be asleep by the third reel. And of course, critics who lean toward the PETA crowd, or dislike imperialism and paternalism, will be offended about once every five minutes by the slaughter of animals and the male&gt;female interaction. (Brave man repeatedly saves screaming, helpless woman.)Granger reminded me so much of Steve Coogan, that I couldn't help but wish they'd remake this as a spoof.If you want an glimpse into what Africa looked like 60 years ago, this would be a wonderful way to spend an hour. Unfortunately, it goes on much longer than an hour, with its paper- thin plot. Read the book if you want real adventure.</fullReview>

It feels authentic but it may be inaccurate or Hollywood-ized, I don't know. This was filmed in the twilight of the colonial era (c. 1950) before television (later satellite TV) and western pop culture invaded these areas.The main characters and plot line are wooden &amp; forgettable... the romantic subplot implausible.BUT my 3 kids loved it as I fast-forwarded over those parts and just showed them the full-color animal scenes and African village scenes. Some great singing, chanting, and dancing. Some of the mountain and desert scenery was interesting. Something about the way the cannibal tribe sequence was done was really effective and creepy.</fullReview>

So MGM in Their Typical Know it All Manner Hires a Woman to Write the Screenplay for this Manly Adventure Story. Sheesh.Secondly, although the Movie goes to Great Lengths and Spends a lot of Money going On Location to Africa and gets some Extraordinary Footage of the Wildlife&nbsp;and the Terrain, but then Assembles it into a Bland Romantic Story with an Ending that is Anti-Climatic. Sheesh.The Movie is Stilted with a Montage that is Clunky and Sophomoric and the Film Ends Up not much Better than a Tarzan Movie with its Positioning of the Dangers of the Dark Continent Paraded Out in Low-Budget Fashion Quickly and with Little Suspense. Sheesh.Look there is a Lion...Look there is a Snake...Look there is a Giraffe...Look there is an Crocodile and so on. These Things Happen so Quickly and without Setup that it is Nothing More than an Excuse. Sheesh.Overall the Native Africans and the Native Wildlife and the Native Landscape Steal the Show from the Adventure and the Romance. It is an Overrated Movie that is OK and Worth a Watch for some Travelogue Eye Candy. Don't Blink or You will miss King Solomon's Mine, but it isn't Missing Much because it isn't Much.

		<fullReview>This film makes my special list: One of the worst pictures ever nominated for best picture. Obviously, it didn't win. "All About Eve" was in a totally different superior class.To say that this film is dull is to put in mildly. We are subjected to all kinds of animals and Deborah Kerr spends most of the film fainting, falling and gradually coming to love Stuart Granger.The premise is good. Kerr and brother, Richard Carlson, go to Africa to locate her missing husband. He ran off to explore and hasn't been heard from in over 2 years. Wait until you discover his fate! Kerr had to find out the very hard way. Of course, there is animosity between Kerr and Granger at first. She had hired him to lead the way.Suddenly, we're into a civil war between the tribes. Luckily, it was a very brief one.The cinematography is nice. I guess the Academy needed this film to round out the 5 required at that time. Come to think of it, there had to be something out there that was better than this junk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say about King Solomon's Mines is that it has some scary bits that you wouldn't find in a film, because, when suspense builds the event that is taking place is scary without any suspense music, because, you must just watch.Here are a few examples of the scary parts:The first one was when everyone was asleep and a leopard came out of nowhere and there was at least 10 seconds of it lurking at the side of the woman's tent.And then, it tries to rip through the side of the tent and the woman woke up and screamed and someone came to here rescue. Sheesh! When I saw that leopard, I could feel my heart thumping in my head!The second one was when the woman was sleeping again BUT she was sleeping somewhere else on the adventure.And suddenly, a rock python came slithering down a broken branch ans slithered towards the women's dress. The women woke up and screamed. Her scream was so loud , I jumped.The third one , was a stupid one. The woman was so angry she went behind a bush to take off her coat and this toy spider crept into her coat (it was suppose to be real, but I could see it wasn't).And when she came back, one of the men she was with saw the spider on her dress and whipped it off. Then the woman saw the spider and she fainted.The fifth one was when they were all in a cave and got trapped by the a rock slide that covered the entrance of the cave when they saw someone's skeleton.These were all the parts that scared me, especially the woman's scream.7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was so disappointed with this picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't tell you how disappointed I was when I got through this picture. I found it boring and not very epic at all. I was expecting an epic of sorts, more adventurous and daring but what we have is a run of the mill picture with some amazing footage. That amazing footage in capturing the tribes doing their thing but the rest is uninspiring.The lack of music was a major disappointment, there was nothing. This picture was crying out for a film score!!! Then we have the stereotypical characters, they were so boring, they had nothing to do! There was no adventure feeling at all.The climax is boring too, it just died, the director seemed bored. Where was the excitement?Technically, the film was shot well but the screenplay was the initial problem, it wasn't very good.Obviously, people will compare this with Raiders of the Lost Ark. I prefer Raiders, which was a near perfect picture, it had a sense of adventure.What a disappointment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Voyage Only</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You need to compare this to "Out of Africa" and "African Queen."And it compares very poorly indeed. Four-fifths of this is the voyage across Africa with only two purposes: to show off the then novel footage of the place, and to portray the snotty, pretty woman loosening up and falling in love with the manly man. This part is dreary, without charm or rhythm. The only charm you might find is Deborah Kerr who to my mind is rather charming.At the end, you'll find two rather unrelated sequences. One involves the mine and is staged like a cheap serial from the 30's. The other concerns a contested Watusi kingship. Except for the final spear throw, this is as fine as you get in terms of discovery photography of native people. Sure, it is staged and clean and exploitative, but rewarding non-the less. Reminds me of a much better film of this native type: "Legong."Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie expecting a great adventure. Instead, I got a movie with great scenery but the movie goes nowhere. The movie look like it was so in love with filming Africa that they didn't bother to come up with an interesting story. It starts out well, but a journey has to have an interesting destination. King Soloman's Mines doesn't. Spoiler alert: When they finally get to the mines, they spend all of five minutes there and seem to shrug off all the diamonds. Huh? You go to all that trouble to journey to this place and you seem not interested when you do. This movie needed more action, thrills, and bruised forearm moments. Scenes involving one wild animal after another, including two straight scenes with snakes in it. Maybe I come from a different generation from this movie (I grew up in the 80s) but I think this movie should have tried harder. Go with the recent version with Patrick Swayze or the underrated Richard Chamberlain version instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was first about to see this movie, I was really excited as I had read the book and considered it to be a real piece of work. However, the movie totally ruined it for me. If the movie had stuck to the book, it would have been great, but nearly all the really cool stuff was replaced with boring garbage.</fullReview>
