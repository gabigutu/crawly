		<shortDescription>This movie doesn't skip a beat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise is far-fetched but simple. Approaching thirty, Tom Seyre (Romain Duris) is working hard as an enforcer and violent rent collector for his dad, a scumbag real estate tycoon (Niels Arestrup). But a chance encounter starts him thinking he might be the talented concert pianist he once dreamed of, in the image of his late mother. Without stopping his usual work he tries to prepare an audition.Based on a flop more admired in France than the US, James Toback's 70's Harvey Keitel vehicle about a violent would-be pianist, "Fingers," this compulsively watchable, thrillingly accomplished new movie by Jacques Audiard ("De Battre mon c?ur s'est arr?té", still showing in Paris as it opens here) echoes his previous compellingly offbeat "Read My Lips" in grafting together two separate moral universes. Read My Lips depicted the odd alliance of a firecracker ex-con (Vincent Cassel) and a mild-mannered but angry hearing-impaired office worker (Emmanuelle Devos). It was an intriguing piece -- but seems low energy in retrospect compared to this. Audiard has made a powerful actors' movie in which Duris blooms, a powerful actor now, playing in effect both the Cassel and the Devos parts and acting out the resulting implosion of violence and frustrated artistic passion with astonishing zest. It's hard to believe he was the tame college student narrator of Klapich's "L'Auberge espagnole" three years ago.Duris as Tom is good-looking but vaguely burnt-out, his eyes a bit crazy, his hair neatly coifed, his jaw firm, has mouth a smiling snarl. The camera is on that square jaw every minute. Uniformed in boots, smart pants, tie and trim leather jacket, he's an elegant young hoodlum who can switch to a dark suit for a real estate hearing or audition, or wipe the blood off his cuff to enter a café or concert hall. He's angry all the time but brings vibrant energy to both of his conflicting lives. Tom finds a beautiful long-haired young master pianist called Miao Lin (Linh Dan Pham) to coach him in piano. These encounters with the keyboard he approaches like a prize fighter going at a punching bag. If he's an artist it's the hairy-chested, coiled, macho kind. How can you teach anybody pianistic excellence? The impossibility of the process is signaled by the teacher's speaking no French. She harangues Tom in Vietnamese, or just says in English over and over, "again" Or "no." Or "no smoking allowed." A cup of tea in the kitchen at end of session. Tom goes at the same piece over and over, a Bach Toccata. This relationship is an "oasis of calm" in Tom's otherwise 'loca' 'vida' -- the contrasts in such a piece as this are telegraphed without much subtlety -- but the unconventionality of the pair helps the scenes to avoid cliché. And the intensity is just as focused in these quiet moments.There are other strong relationships. Tom isn't isolated; he works with partners, one of whom uses him to hide his two-timing from his wife. Arestrup, who looks like a French version of late Brando, is superb as the blowsy, burnt out father, a big sensualist, an irresistible presence, always smoking drinking and eating, soft but nasty, irritating but impossible for Tom not to love and protect. Tom pursues Minskov (Anton Yakovlev), a Russian Mafioso his dad has tangled with, and winds up sleeping with Minskov's French girlfriend as well as somebody else's wife. Every encounter he has is reckless and intense. Duris doesn't fail us in any of this. Emmanuelle Devos is his dad's new girlfriend, whom Tom first calls a whore and rejects and then wants to hire on to calm things on the home front. Where's it all going to end? Despite all that's going on, as one French critic said, "there's no fat" in this picture. The pushes and pulls of the hero's dilemma make for fabulously kinetic editing and the action never goes soft. A final sequel resolves things. Some say it's milder than the American version, but that's overlooking the visceral punch of the action throughout. The dialogue underlines that just as in Read My Lips, people aren't communicating too well. It may be music is all that links them.The shortcomings of such a movie are its simplifications. The crooked real estate life like the classical pianist life can be no more than impressionistically dabbed in. And there's an occasional danger that Romain Duris -- who studied piano for months with his pianist sister for the keyboard sequences -- may be trying too hard sometimes. Since Tom also loves electro which he listens to with big headphones in his car -- as the word is Duris himself does -- classical music maybe doesn't grab the film as wholeheartedly as it ought to. You can't expect profundity but from the sound of "Fingers," this is more accomplished film-making. It may not have as much conviction, but this is wildly entertaining. And more than that, it's a movie where everything comes together, scenario, actors, editing. Audiard, who showed us dark secret places last time, now reveals himself a virtuoso of violence and passion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't miss this one (in America it's called "The Beat My Heart Skipped")</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rising French director Jacques Audiard ("Read My Lips") has naturally relocated James Toback's "Fingers" from New York City to Paris. He's also modified the Mafioso's in the original by creating a tight gang of 'real estate' brokers (brokers that break windows, dump rats, etc. to move squatters off their properties).Basic plot line involves a young man, 'Tom', who is very much caught up in 'the life' of being a thug like his father. He pals around with his two partners and they work hard by day and party harder at night (usually ending with a barfight). Then one day he spots his deceased mother's old music agent who offers him an audition in gratitude (Tom's mother was a professional concert pianist).What follows is an intriguing and humorous plot line as Tom takes on a piano coach (from Beijing no less) and tries to regain his affinity with the piano almost ten years after he'd stopped playing.Extremely well-acted film with Romain Duris (as 'Tom') offering up one of those rare performances that's absolutely mesmerizing (most USA audiences will remember him from "L'Auberge espagnole" - another French film worth your time!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting, first-class film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "The Beat that my heart skipped" is an immaculately crafted and relentlessly gripping film. Its existential premise (a dodgy estate broker feels a sudden urge to rekindle his long abandoned passion for piano-playing whose rarefied world comes in contrast with his everyday life and seedy activities) is rooted in the world of film-noir. The escalating conflict between his "duties" and his lofty aspirations is unerringly captured while maintaining an eye for subtle but telling characterization of the supporting characters. Through his inner turmoil, the main drama materializes and the theme of unfulfilled potential due to a multiplicity of factors not always within somebody's control poignantly emerges.Jacques Audiard, not the most famous but certainly one of the most talented french directors of the last ten years, has remarkably transcribed the mythology and some of the most eminent film-noir themes onto the modern era. The framing, lighting, music (especially its juxtaposition), mood and plot development are spot-on while the main performance my Romain Duris is career defining. The film stands out as one of the best modern neo-noir -a film with a rather singular style, akin to the director's equally commendable previous works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent film, and highly recommended. Its script is absolutely wonderful, showing the protagonist having a dark and ugly side, yet possessing the ability to express his sensitivity, as a classical pianist, through music, as he prepares for an audition with an agent. The juxtaposition of the two opposing sides of the protagonist lends the film an unexpected power and impact. It is a violent film, yet a humorous one at the same time, with great acting. De battre mon coeur is a remake of Fingers, which unfortunately I have not seen (yet). I can only hope that the French film will be released in The Netherlands as well, so I can see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>how do the French do it?? &amp; why can't American film makers come close? this is a remake of the film "Fingers" released in the '70's directed by James Toback &amp; starred Harvey Keitel. this remake is a beautifully told story that grabs you from the beginning &amp; only lets go at the very satisfying end. brilliant acting by all, most notably Romain Duris. briefly, it is a study in the psychological make-up of a late 20's macho guy torn between his artistic nature inherited from his concert pianist mother &amp; his real estate thug of a father. Duris walks/acts on a very high wire balancing the 2 sides &amp; has the audience rooting for his desire to overcome his distaste for the seamy business he has "inherited" from his father. if 1 were to see only 1 film this summer, i would highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe the best French film I've seen so far this year- stylish, realistic, not for everyone...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the particular movie fan, The Beat That My Heart Skipped, is a slice of intensity, wonder, and subtlety that can only come from Europe. The director/co-writer, Jacques Audiard, has taken a film previously made by James Toback called Fingers, starring Harvey Keitel in the role now occupied by Romain Duris, and made it his own. If I had seen the original version I would make a couple of comparisons to it (at the least, for those who didn't see the original the remake makes you want to check out the original, if only for the acting appeal of Keitel). However I did think about another wonderful French film in the vein of this film- Francois Truffaut's Shoot the Piano Player.While Truffaut's film is a little more concerned about the lead's relationship(s) with women, I felt a kind of connection between the material of the two pieces- sometimes intense, usually lyrical, tales of a person trying to find what fits more for them, the more criminal side, or the artistic side. And, much like Truffaut and his other New-Wave counterparts, Audiard successfully takes an American formula picture and forms it well into a French setting.There are a few reasons to recommend the movie, one would be for the music, which gives repeated but specific renditions of a Bach tune. Another would be just for the technical-side, which is well-done in hand-held, neo-noir style by Stephane Fontaine. Another could even just be for how Audiard tells his story, or sometimes doesn't tell it: a couple of times mid-way through the film, I wondered if the story of this character would 'go' anywhere, which can either make or break a film of this kind. It pleasantly (or intensely) did, bringing a catharsis for a viewer by the final scenes.But likely for most the prominent reason would be for the realistic acting, in particular by its star Duris. As I said, I can't make comparisons between a heavyweight like Keitel and Duris (whom I've never seen in a film before this), but on his own terms Duris creates his character believably. It's at times a complex character, or sometimes not- he has that kind of attitude and face where you don't know whether he's really a 'street-level' guy or more straight laced. The split that is also apparent in the character's parents, one a classic pianist who's passed on (the mother), and the other a more criminal-type of a father, also gives the film an added boost of psychological energy. The lead in this film, much like with the storytelling (or lack of it), dictates how it may turn out.In the end, Audiard and Duris make it compelling enough for the film to be about him, his conflicts, his lusts, his music. It's a wonderful movie that seems to have passed under the radar (it's in only a few theaters around the area) amid other independent summer fare, but if you're an enthusiast of character-driven thrillers that give a bitter-sweet edge, it's a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb human drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE BEAT THAT MY HEART SKIPPED (Jacques Audiard - France 2005).It's usually the other way round, but this time the French took a shot at remaking an American film, James Toback's FINGERS (1978), which starred Harvey Keitel. And the result is excellent. This riveting human drama by Jacques Audiard features an impressive performance by Romain Duris as Tom, a 28 year-old hoodlum who seems destined to follow in his father's footsteps as a property shark working in a sleazy, barely legal twilight zone of the dodgy Parisian real-estate world. But a chance encounter with a former music teacher leads him to believe that he can become, like his mother, a concert pianist. With the help of a young virtuoso pianist, who just arrived from China, he starts preparing for a crucial audition, but soon the pressures from his former pals mount and he gets trapped between two opposite worlds. But Tom is not just a sensible artistic young man desperately trying to escape the world he lives in. He's not entirely sure he wants to leave his old life behind him. He's got a mean streak and when necessary, he takes care of some unresolved matters using whatever means he deems appropriate to take care of unwilling partners, squatters or whoever gets in the way of his (or his father's business interests), really putting the squeeze on people unwilling to cooperate. Romain Duris injects his role with an enormous amount of vibrancy and energy. I've never seen Duris in another role before, but his character is complex, perennially nervous, strained, angry, but incredibly charming. One moment he's in leather jacket, wiping the blood of his face after a little bashing with some squatters. The next, he's in suit and tie and negotiates with real-estate moguls. The film's atmosphere is dark, moody and downbeat, but Tom's vibrant energy and aggression firmly keeps the viewer's attention. Jacques Audiard's direction is remarkable assured. He seems to know exactly what he wants to present on the screen, never showy and a keen camera eye to give the already top-notch performances maximum impact. What's so refreshing, is that the film doesn't make a big point out of the human relationships. It never becomes overly sentimental, but at the same time all these characters are real and completely believable, just incredibly vivid characterizations. Sharply written, stylish, expertly paced, directed and performed, this is definitely one to catch.Camera Obscura --- 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grace From Gracelessness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Beat That My Heart Skipped has the pulse of a major film, a certain energy that pulls you in, makes you interested in what it's doing. Its director, Jacques Audiard, gives one the impression that his is a big-league talent; there's a hum to his images that recalls Inarritu, without quite the same manic intensity, and for a brief moment or two puts one in mind of Scorsese, particularly GoodFellas (an early bar-fight scene recalls the dreamy, fixed-in-time feeling of some of Scorsese's violence). His lead actor, Romain Duris, has something of the young De Niro's quality of pent-up violence and greasy charm, but leavened by a more intellectual, less visceral Europeanness. Like Scorsese and De Niro in Taxi Driver, Audiard and Duris conspire to create a memorable study of a low-life seeking to emerge from the slime, though this time the low-life is armed with talent and confidence, and seems maybe capable of turning his dire situation around.The low-life, Thomas Seyr, is a real-estate broker who's involved in all sorts of shady business deals; he and his slimy partners, Fabrice (Jonathan Zaccai) and Sami (Gilles Cohen), spend much of their time chasing squatters out of the buildings they've procured (planting rats in their room is a favorite tactic), and trying to work their way around government housing regulations (when a group of homeless come to take up residence in one of their tenements they hurriedly smash everything, rendering the rooms uninhabitable; the script seems to be taking advantage of certain sore social issues here). Thomas, a button-man who happens to sometimes work in an office, was born to this kind of work; his father, Robert (the marvelous Niels Arestrup), is also involved in less-than-legitimate enterprise, and sometimes calls upon Thomas to take care of unpleasant business (like beating people up who refuse to pay). Thomas, however, has an unexpected artistic side; his deceased mother was a concert pianist, and one day while driving around the city he encounters her old manager, Fox (Sandy Whitelaw), who encourages him to return to his study of the piano, which he has nearly given up. This awakens in Thomas some latent ambition, a desire to escape his sleazy circumstances; he re-commits himself to his art, which leads him to the door of a recent Chinese immigrant, Miao Lin (Linh Dan Pham), who tutors him, somewhat awkwardly as she speaks no French and he no Chinese. Thomas's less-than-honest life has saddled him with numerous obligations however, ones it will be difficult to leave behind.The movie's theme is a familiar one: the impossibility of entirely escaping one's past, especially when one is still actively engaged in living the life that has caused one to have a shady past in the first place. Rather than deal with this in some abstract way, Audiard tackles the theme organically; we see what a bundle of unspent nervous energy Thomas is, and realize how his essential personality, his craziness, is the thing that really keeps him from being a pianist instead of a thug. This is not a story of fate being for or against anyone; it's not some cosmic force that keeps Thomas from leaving behind his old life but his own nature, and that of the people around him, especially his father, who is fundamentally a coward and needs Thomas to take care of things for him. Thomas's artistic endeavors are hindered by his inability to focus himself; he can't sit still for a second, and when he plays, the frustration drives him to hammer the keys like he should be able to beat a tune out of the instrument the same way he beats money out of people who owe. His personality is all jagged edges, and what he needs is to smooth them out, to reign in his impulses, his anger. This makes his introduction to Miao Lin all the more fortunate, for she has the patience of a saint, the quiet firmness needed to help tame his immature nature, to bring his fires under control. Romain Duris gives a live-wire performance as Thomas, something reminiscent of the Mean Streets De Niro, and that other great seventies sleaze-ball actor Warren Oates. He's basically an overgrown kid; he seems like his system is always pumped full of sugar (or maybe something stronger), and he has no inhibitions whatsoever which makes him a kick to be around, yet there's something doomed about him, the quality of a ticking time-bomb. Thomas might be a fun guy and a loyal friend (his loyalty is one of his failings), but you just know that sooner or later life is going to blow up in his face.Audiard and writing partner Tonino Benacquista have smoothly transplanted the plot of James Toback's '70s cult item Fingers (which starred Harvey Keitel), and tweaked it to make it work in modern-day France. The pair seem to have an affinity for rough-edged-but-lovable characters coming under the influence of tender-but-firm women; their earlier film, Read My Lips, dealt with a similar situation, but was more straightforwardly a thriller, and didn't seem as refined either narratively or thematically as The Beat That My Heart Skipped. Audiard is a fantastically assured director, able to infuse a scene with energy without resorting to empty stylistics, and able to elicit dynamic performances that never edge into showiness. Audiard has a feel for the natural energies his actors give off; he taps into Duris's nervous charm, the nagging inadequacy of Niels Arestrup as Thomas's nuisance of a father, the radiant stillness of Linh Dan Pham as Miao Lin. This is one director who makes good movie-making seem easy, rather than making it seem hard on purpose so people will appreciate it more. Add Audiard to the list of modern directors whose next film is a must-see</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a first for the French cinema, the remake of an American film, when just the opposite is what happens always. The Americans love to redo what some French director did before, with mediocre results. "The Beat that my Heart Skipped" was adapted for the screen by Jacques Audiard and Tonino Benaquesta, from the 1978 film by James Toback, an under appreciated director that deserves more credit for his work in this country. Mr. Audiard directed the French version.As a character study of Thomas, the film somewhat succeeds in presenting his ambivalence as a petty criminal and as a frustrated pianist that is trying to regain his skill in playing the instrument. Thomas is, from all accounts, an ugly character that will engage in all kinds of under handed situations in order to make a living. Most of the motivation in Thomas' actions is driven by his loyalty to his small crook father, who is constantly nagging him to take care of the old man's criminal activities as well.In Romain Duris, director Audiard gets a multi layered performance that is what keeps the film going. Mr. Duris, an intense actor, is the dominant figure in the movie, and perhaps the excuse for seeing the film. Nils Arestrup, as the father, has also some good moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting character study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of us take a large portion of our DNA from the father's side, other the mother's. With 28-year-old Thomas Seyr (Romain Duris), it's a 50/50 affair. He is just as much as (maybe even more so) of a thug as his father is in his shady activities as a real estate broker, but at the same time promising material for concert pianist following his mother's footsteps. His father, over-the-hill but refusing to quit, we see considerably in the movie. His mother we never see, as she died when he was a youth, shattering his musical dreams.The plot is not so much of a linear story, but more of a cross-sectional cuts of various aspects of Thomas' life. On the more mundane side are his business activities that alway verge on being criminal, his affair with his partner's neglected wife and his relationship with his father to whom he seems quite devoted.More interesting is his musical pursuits, triggered by a chance encounter with his late mother's manager who remembers his talent and invites him to an audition "when he is ready". This leads to his seeking help from an accomplished pianist Miao Lin, a young women who studied in the Beijing Conservatory, just arrived in Paris, speaking no French at all and "just a little" English. (Here we see the not unusual sloppiness when an Asian aspect is covered in a "western" movie. There is absolutely no logical reason for a woman from China to be speaking Vietnamese, except for one - the actress IS Vietnamese). Anyway, the communication purely through music and gesture is very well handled.The shooting style is quite contemporary, and leans towards using darker scenes. Interesting to note that in the two series of piano practicing scenes, it's always dark and gloomy when he plays at home, but is reasonably bright when he is at coach Miao Lin's place.As with such non-story-oriented movies, the ending is inconclusive. But that does not matter as it is the character study that is of prime interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like French movies. Most of the time. But The Beat that My Heart Skipped is a real yawn. The story of a thug-for-hire who really wants to play the piano sounds about as pretentious as you can get, but I don't hold that against it. In other hands it could have been brilliant but this episodic disjointed, glum little film is very far from brilliant.There are some nice scenes and original ideas here, but never nice or original enough to make you care about the characters. Thomas Seyr is good in the lead role but there's only so much he can do in this bitty, unrelentingly downbeat film.On the plus side, the soundtrack is vibrant and does its best to lift the movie, but every time you think something really pivotal's going to happen... it doesn't.The best thing about this film is it's lovely title. The film doesn't deserve it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen Sur mes levres and liked it a lot, and having read reviews of this one that made it sound even better, I had high expectations.Alas, my initial disappointment with the opening scenes was confirmed as the film went on. I couldn't believe a single character except the father's mistress, Christine, played by Emmanuelle Devos, who made the film live for the two brief scenes in which she appeared. The first of those was quite early on, and I thought that the film was going to pull itself together and turn into something really good; but she disappeared then until another short scene quite close to the end.I found Romain Duris' performance tedious. He was not bad at the gangster bits, I suppose; but as a classical pianist, he was embarrassing to watch. To be fair, the character was just not credible -- you can't think of becoming a concert pianist if you are 28 years old and haven't practised for 10 years -- but all the swaying and drooping and bellows of anguish were so ridiculous that at times I had difficulty continuing to watch.I have no idea what point the director thought he was trying to make, and I don't think he had much of an idea either. Was he showing that it was possible to change, or that it was not?A complete waste of time, unfortunately. I just wish there were more films around with Emanuelle Devos. For an awkward woman with no real beauty, she has a presence and a power of attraction that are hard to withstand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I have said previously French films can either be very good or like this one where the director seems more concerned with an esoteric format to produce what is in the end nothing.The film starts with potential but degenerates into a series of angst that the main character is attempting to resolve.This leads to a very disjointed movie where nothing of consequence happens and the viewer is left to employ some form of rational to begin to understand the story line. Experimental cinema has a place but to regard this movie as some form of new wave is a gross misunderstanding. I believe that there is a cult of film making and watching that "like the Emperors new clothes" permeates the industry where begin,middle and end are inconsequential and there more avant Gard they appear the more they are accepted.Techniques are fine but they must be employed within the frame work of a genuine story told in believable format with the enjoyment or compulsion of the watcher paramount.It is fine line between puerile rubbish and this type of film but an attempt to relate to the masters of previous successful productions would lead to far more success than this banal attempt to be modernistic and yet void of real incident.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>creative moments, but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A protagonist leading a double life as a hard man with artistic aspirations as a pianist ? neither original nor particularly plausible, but perhaps an interesting premise for a film in the hands of a promising director. Overbearing sentimentality seems to afflict so many films these days, and opportunity for cliché here was rife. A happy ending would have been nice, of course, but entirely unrealistic and predictable. The film does revolve around a slightly cringe-worthy father-mother-son emotional triangle, although to his credit, Audiard does (largely) side-step such temptations. The ending is in fact particularly well crafted and shrewd, and Romain Duris in the lead role is convincing in pulling off his double persona, so the film does succeed in attaining a much needed degree of realism.What's more, Audiard is clearly a talented director. The hand-held camera work comes across well, and its play of focus on background lights, particularly on distant car headlamps, serves as an interesting motif throughout. I also particularly liked the nods to film noir ? all those profile shots of Duris with only the lower half of his face visible ? which lend Duris' character a brooding power.Several aspects of the plot, however, were weak, which meant the film didn't hang entirely straight. Tom's chancing upon his mother's agent who happens to give him an audition straight off seems rather clumsy, and his friendship with his estate-agent buddies is mysterious ? they just seem so horrible, and Duris clearly has an ounce of moral fibre in him, so why attach himself to them? Of course, the film puts it down to his loyalty to his crooked father, but this too seems a little thin. Neither is there much substance in his adoration of the piano ? he sits wiggling his fingers for hours on end, wrapped in a classical cocoon, yet listens to hard electronica whenever he wants to relax.This is a film worth watching then, with plenty of creative spark, but I'm not sure it lives up to the hype generated by impressed critics. 6/7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps it doesn't seem like such a big deal to a lot of people, but I was completely turned off by how *badly* the actor faked at playing the piano. It's like he never ever saw someone playing the piano in his life! The film became pure comedy for me when watching the scenes with his piano teacher. It wasn't as bad as Adrien Brody's fake playing, but it was still noticeable enough to make me question what the director was thinking. Is it so hard to find an actor who can actually *play* the piano? I'm just thankful the main character wasn't a violinist or cellist (can you imagine how horrible that would be...it would be pinky fingers going in all directions...) Gosh darnit, you actors! If you're going to fake-play an instrument, be believable!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this film based on a whim. The box had some good quotes and such so I took it home.The movie opens up slow setting the plot. Father problems, boring conversation and dialogue. Any discussion of how intense the draw between Tom's artistic world vs. his gangster one is garbage. The man grew up and into the gang life stlye and is now trying to find himself through art.The whole story felt like it needed more. The main characters are referred to as "gangsters"? They beat the homeless. I cant help but imagine how this movie would of turned out if it were made for an American audience. It felt as if the director wanted to play a kind of safe-feeling tone. I felt pretty certain when predicting that the end bad-guy would NOT get shot because I couldn't imagine seeing something so gruesome actually being shown. I was a bit surprised when they actually showed the father's dead body.The only thing that made me certain my time was not entirely wasted was the cinematography. Some of the shots of Tom driving drew me back into the character's mindset. Tom with his piano teacher was a happy surprise.If there is any moment where a movie can capture any true sense of life then I can consider it a worthy watch. I felt a few of these moments such as when Tom asks her to pause in the doorway. It reminded me how random and admirable life can be. At the end I did not feel motivated or as if i had just seen a good movie. The director has skills, they just did not show through here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>French screenwriter and director Jacques Audiard's fourth feature film which he co-wrote with French author and screenwriter Tonino Benacquista, is a remake of American filmmaker James Toback's narrative feature "Fingers" from 1978. It premiered In competition at the 55th Berlin International Film Festival in 2005, was shot on location in Paris, France and is a French production which was produced by producer Pascal Chaucheteux. It tells the story about a 28-year-old man named Thomas Seyr who works as a kind of real estate broker in Paris, France for his gangster father named Robert whom is getting remarried to a model named Christine. Whilst spending most of his time with his friend Fabrice who is depending on him as an alibi to cover up for is numerous affairs and becoming infatuated with his friend's wife, Thomas decides to revive a talent he stopped practicing ten years ago. Following his mother's footsteps and distancing himself from his father's lifestyle, Thomas starts taking piano lessons with a pianist named Miao Lin.Distinctly and precisely directed by French filmmaker Jacques Audiard, this finely tuned fictional tale which is narrated mostly from the protagonist's point of view, draws an intimate and profound portrayal of a relationship between a French man and a Vietnamese woman who's communication is somewhat limited by their differing languages. While notable for it's naturalistic and atmospheric milieu depictions, sterling cinematography by French cinematographer Stéphane Fontaine and use of music, this character-driven and narrative-driven psychological drama depicts a consistently involving and multifaceted study of character where the main character's inner struggle and mastering of his emotions interrelates with the narrative's continuity and contains a great score by French film composer Alexandre Desplat.This romantic, humorous and dramatic story about a young man who is driven by his passion for women and a constant duality within him, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, abrupt editing, incisive depiction of interpersonal relations, the versatile acting performance by French actor Romain Duris, the efficiently understated acting performance by Vietnamese-born French actress Lin Dan Pham and the fine acting performance by French actor Niels Arestrup. A poetic, heartfelt and memorable thriller-drama which gained, among other awards, the award for Best Film Not in the English Language at the 59th BAFTA AWARDS in 2005.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Portrait of the artist as a young hoodlum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Seyr (Romain Duris) is a nattily dressed 28-year old Parisian real estate debt enforcer who works for his father (Niels Arestrup), a sleazy housing profiteer. Seyr and his low-life buddies, Fabrice (Jonathan Zacca) and Sami (Gilles Cohen), acquire property for resale at a profit, making certain by any means necessary including violence that all squatters are removed. When a chance encounter opens the possibility for the opportunity for Tom to become a concert pianist like his mother, he finds that breaking away from his past is not so easy. Winner of eight César awards including best film and best director, Jacques Audiard's The Beat That My Heart Skipped is a loose remake of James Toback Fingers starring Harvey Keitel. In Fingers, Keitel plays the son of a gangster and a concert pianist who is torn between the efficiency of his father's profession and the passion of his deceased mother.The Beat That My Heart Skipped is shot with dark colors to create a mood of foreboding. It is not all atmosphere, however. Audiard uses disorienting jump cuts, bizarre camera angles, and a hand-held camera close to the character's anatomy to create a frenetic pace and energy to spare. Romain Duris, a young French actor loaded with talent and charisma, plays the tightly wound Seyr with manic intensity. He is an operator on the lowest level, beating up restaurant proprietors that are delinquent in their bills and unleashing rats in a tenement to drive out the squatters. He seems to relish the jobs he is asked to do but still dreams of becoming a concert pianist. When he runs into his mother's former concert manager, (Sandy Whitelaw) he asks for the opportunity for an audition, then engages a petite Chinese piano teacher Miao Lin (Linh-Dan Pham) to assess his abilities. Since he does not speak Chinese and she does not speak French, the film could have been called Read My Lips II.Miao is a civilizing influence and tries to stop Seyr from attacking the piano as if he was clubbing a tenant behind in his rent but cannot put a lid on his temperament. Their relationship develops slowly but erupts as both explode in frustration at his inability to follow instructions or master Bach's Toccata. To make life even more complicated, he is having an affair with his best friend's wife, and also brazenly seduces a mobster's girlfriend. While continuing to develop his artistic sensibility, Seyr carries out his father's suggestions to "take care" of recalcitrant payees, presumably out of love or guilt or both. He is very protective of his father and does not refuse his requests, though he has little respect for him, telling him that the woman he is thinking of marrying is a whore.When Seyr agrees to take on Minskov (Anton Yakovlev), a Russian Mafia boss who does not keep his promises, it is clear that he is in over his head and he begins to rethink his relationship with his father. Audiard captures the character's nervous intensity and brings the macho sub-culture of Paris to life, yet the film lacks any semblance of warmth. The Beat That My Heart Skipped is about choices and the willingness to change our direction in life and we relate to Seyr's struggle with different sides of his personality. While Duris' performance rings with a fundamental honesty, I found it difficult to locate a common humanity with this dark, shady man. His cold, abrasive personality and the film's gratuitous violence make this portrait of the artist as a young hoodlum difficult to embrace. Somehow thuggery against poor people and the humanity of Beethoven or Mozart seem incompatible. While there is a lot to admire here, for me it is a film that my heart skipped.</fullReview>

He and his colleagues use the nastiest means to oust the occupants. fighting, tearing the room into pieces, putting snake (or rats?) through the door slit - the beginning of the film is full of violent happenings in the dark. There isn't the faintest sign that this electro lover approaching his 30s can be a talented pianist.his life is changed when he meets an old colleague of his mother who reminds him that his mom was a brilliant concert pianist. he is invited for an audition and since then his life is filled with his passionate pursuit of his dream. he has lessons every day with a Chinese pianist miao lin. the Chinese girl can hardly speak any french, nor is she very expressive of her emotions. it is quite intriguing to observe how they interact in the film.the efforts he spends on the preparation has changed him. when he goes back to his real estate job, the beat of his heart "stops" as he comes to see how spiteful a life he has had. it is wise to leave it like this without further description. this makes the ending more enigmatic. two days after watching the film i am still pondering what was meant by the glance at the end, what kind of emotions tom must have &amp; why he does not kill the Russian guy.Romain Duris is a brilliant actor. most scenes were emotionally intense and very well-acted. i am excited to see how he listens to and plays music. not only are the piano pieces pleasing, the techno also thrills (trance is great!). i like it so much the way it portrays the dark side of his life at the beginning. a hard but realistic film which deserves one's mental efforts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Beat that my Heart Skipped is a beautiful film.Thomas Seyr is a property dealer. A broker. A fast talker. A fixer. He and his two partners encourage sellers to sell cheap. Encouragement includes releasing rats into the property at night or the liberal use of baseball bats.But this is a beautiful film.Mr Shady Adrenalin-Rush Seyr has a past. Not a bad past - more of a silver lining that accidentally gets uncovered. Like his mother, he used to play piano. A twist of circumstances has him suddenly realising he has a chance to be a pianist and he takes lessons to prepare for an audition. An audio flashback has his teacher telling him, "The emotion is not very generous" and at the same time the film slips into a minor key as our emotional involvement with the character kicks in.Playing piano interferes with Thomas' being a total bastard, much to the annoyance of his colleagues who don't want him pussyfooting around with such a silly hobby, but the audience and Thomas sense a soul struggling to shine through his shitty persona and the amphetamine paced timeframe stops the movie from going gooilly sentimental. More formula as we see him at the piano naked from the waist up after making love, flattering lighting, Chopin, Debussy, Bach and Mozart. Sensuousness and arty mix. Electro moves to classical. The Beat that My Heart Skipped carefully pushes all the right buttons, but still seems fresh given French naturalistic acting, an unpredictable storyline, great soundtrack, and being entertaining and funny. A remake of an American movie with Harvey Keitel, it stands up quite well even if lacking in substance.Thomas perhaps eventually finds what his heart missed, though not quite as predicted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense, haunting and, at times, creepy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In many ways this French film reminds me of "Good Will Hunting" and the old William Holden film "Golden Boy" combined--though it is far better than either of these previous films.Thomas (Romain Duris) is a very unsavory young man. His job is a sleazy one--he dispossesses squatters from apartments. In France, it is NOT easy to legally dispossess these folks--so Thomas and his thuggish friends beat the crap out of them or toss rats into the apartments to get the folks to leave. It seems that Thomas learned a lot from his ne'er do well father. However, hidden within is a part of his dead mother. The woman was a concert pianist and Thomas had this as his career goal as well. And, when Thomas happens to see his mother's old manager, the dream of being a respected pianist reignites within him. But just practicing the piano and improving his skills isn't enough- -he must decide if he wants to become respectable or remain a thug. Through much of the film, Thomas bounces back and forth between the two extremes. Where will Thomas eventually land?The film is much better than the other films mentioned because Thomas' journey wasn't fast and his change wasn't complete and magical. In the other films, the problem was just too black and white and the changes unrealistic. Here, however, with a better script and a really nice performance by Duris, you've got a really compelling film. My only reservation is that this is NOT a film for everyone--it's very violent, sexual and not a neat picture that follow the expected formula. Well worth seeing regardless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake interesting for Romain Duris' role as a villain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2005 French film DE BATTRE MON COEUR S'EST ARRETE ("The Beat that My Heart Skipped") is director Jacques Audiard's remake of the obscure 1978 American film FINGERS.Thomas (Romain Duris) is a shady real estate developer in Paris, releasing rats in apartment blocks to drive out the residents, then buying up the property before they can move back in. He is torn between this dishonourable profession like his scumbag father (Niels Arestrup) and a career as a concert pianist like his late mother. Seeking a way out of his violent lifestyle, he hires a Vietnamese pianist (Linh Dan Pham) to help him reach a professional level, and though they share no common language, it proves a fruitful partnership.Though the story remains powerful for much of its length, things seem somewhat rushed towards the end. It is suggested that character of Thomas' father's ex-girlfriend will play a major role, but then she disappears. And the ending itself, which I won't give away, is an ambiguous statement about whether Thomas has found peace with himself or not. Perhaps these flaws were present in FINGERS, I don't know, though I do know that the remake that is DE BATTRE has 17 minutes of new scenes, mainly dealing with Thomas' work with his piano teacher.Regardless of its plot and the comparison to the original, what makes DE BATTRE an interesting effort in itself are the performances. Many viewers will have known Romain Duris only from his turn as the innocent European manchild Xavier in 2000's L'AUBERGE ESPAGNOLE and its sequels. Here, however, Duris convincingly plays his occasionally villainous role and keeps up the nervousness of a man who can't find a way out.The film's soundtrack is an unusual mix of obscure pop, classical piano, and (Tom's personal favourite) the electro genre that exploded in 2005. The film music by Alexandre Desplats won the Silver Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2005.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast, tense with outstanding acting and a clever storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)Jacques Audiard, who previously gave us the very interesting Read My Lips (2001) and the cute and clever Venus Beauty Institute (1999), manages to create here a story about a character who is both a petty gangster and a pianist. Not exactly your usual combination of talents. Romain Duris plays Thomas Seyr who is that character. Duris brings an animal sensuality and an artist's sensitivity to the part. He is an actor of unusual skills and vitality. Audiard gets the most out of him.In the beginning Tom Seyr is in apprenticeship to take over his father's way of life in a French version of the protection racket. Their particular hustle involves getting properties condemned by trashing them or infecting them with rats or some other vermin, forcibly throwing out squatters or tenants, then buying the property on the cheap, and then finally selling it at a nice profit. In the end, Tom...well, I can't give you the ending, but I can say that it is entirely agreeable and surprising with just a little twist on what we might expect.Neils Arestrup plays the father. There are some other interesting characters and a lot of macho action, a bit of blood here and there, some quick and easy sex. And then there is an old piano teacher that Tom happens to run into one day who invites him to an audition. Tom has not played the piano seriously for years, but just seeing his old teacher brings back the thrill and the deep intimacy he once had with music, and recalls to him the career of his deceased mother, who was once a concert pianist who had hoped that her son would be too. He had the talent.But of course playing the piano at that level is not something you can take up, let go, and then go back to. But Tom thinks maybe he can do it with a little practice. But he needs a teacher to prepare for the audition. When he tries to get one he is effectively laughed at since he is 28-years-old and is very much out of practice and indeed never really practiced that much. But by chance (there are a number of plot furtherances in this film that come about by chance--but that is not a problem because the chance meetings seem natural and are events that would probably happen eventually)--and so by chance he is hooked up with a young woman fresh from China who speaks no French, but is an expert pianist who needs a little money. She agrees to help him. Her name is Miao Lin. She is played brilliantly with subtlety and finesse by French-Vietnamese actress Linh Dan Pham, whom I previously saw in Indochine (1992) playing the adopted child of Catherine Deneuve's character.The acting ability of Romain Duris and Linh Dan Pham are what carry this film. Audiard's direction is a bit scattered at times and especially in the beginning lacks focus, but a clever storyline and his ability to get great performances from the players overcome these faults.See this for Romain Duris who gives a virtuoso performance and for Linh Dan Pham who captivates with restrained intensity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom works in shifty real-estate deals with friend Fabice. Evicting squatters from lots in tasteless ways. Ocassionaly Tom collects debts from clients for his father Robert, also practising in questionable real-estate deals. On a chance encounter of his mothers old manager, his love of playing the piano is rekindled; not since played from his mothers death. Hoping for an audition, Tom enlists the help of Linh Dan Pham, a Vietnamese woman who doesn't speak any French.The Beat My Heart Skipped is a French remake of Fingers. Usually it is the other way around with America remaking a foreign language films, so this is quite a refreshing film in that regard. Unfilimar with the original James Toback film, director Jacques Audiard; also screenwriter with Tonino Benacquista, have taken the challenge of completely transporting the story into a French setting, and succeeded in this task.Audiard explores the relationship between parents and their children. Starting as a thug for his father, Tom becomes torn when his love of the piano is reborn. His love of his mother, which becomes tested when Robert decides to remarry, drives his passion to receive an audition. There's a sense of unspoken words Tom never said to his mother, the return to music as a way of redemption. Yet he is drawn back into the seedy world of his father; not wanting to lose him too. The piano is Tom's return to childhood naivety, dropping his responsibilities to emotionally free himself from his father's grip.Utilising hand held camera work, Audiard creates a chaotic sensibility. The camera is constantly on the move, seeking different angles. This chaos evokes an immediacy, not the urgency its seeking. Scenes are fast, many not lasting very long, for all the frenetic pacing, Audiard keeps it cohesive; along with one very commanding and captivating performance by Romain Duris. A wonderful mix dark brutality and beautiful music are skillfully balanced, with beauty found in the brutal and an emotional darkness in the music.The Beat My Heart Skipped is a captivating film that immediately draws you in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Beat That My Heart Skipped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Thomas Seyr (Romain Duris) could be any of us in the working class. Stuck in two worlds about what he really wants to do, versus what he has to do. In the shady corner of the real estate business relying on underhand tactics, he finds no joy. In the other world which presented itself as an opportunity to start again, he must upgrade in order to be accepted. It never is easy, then again, life never is to begin with.Constantly frustrated at his predicament, you begin to wonder towards which characteristics of his parents would he gravitate to - the father, who's about to remarry, and is living the life that Thomas secret disapproves, and that he fears he's subconsciously becoming his father's son, or his deceased mom, an accomplished pianist. Given the chance to dig deep into his potential of following in his mom's footsteps, he thought he could find joy in emulating his mother's success, but success always is the outcome of hard work, and plenty of frustrations along the way.With the help of a Chinese pianist (played by Linh Dan Pham), he sets himself a goal to be ready for an audition to set a new future for himself, and the classical music numbers greatly contrasts with Thomas' choice of Euro-techno music which he plays over his beautiful earphones, and I enjoyed prior to watching the movie, thanks to a friend who introduced me to Telepopmusik's Just Breathe, which was used.While juggling between real work, and his potential aspiration, things go awry with his love and sex life, when he falls for one of his friend's wife, and when his dad gets mixed up with and swindled by Russian gangsters. I particularly liked the scene where he sought out the Russian Minskov, where he goes about without a clue to try and straighten things out with the mobster, only to have him call and threaten him loudly over the phone, in the sudden presence of a passer-by. And what he did for revenge, was totally comical too, in context.There are moments in this film which painfully brings out themes of frustration, of being lost at a crossroads, and of deciding for oneself what your calling is. Decide for yourself if you're up for some serious fare about the choices presented in life, and about that leap of faith that you take in trying to achieve some of those goals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Beat that My Heart Skipped (2005)A striving, serious movie (even the weirdly incorrect title is serious) that ends up being an up and down jumble. I wanted to really get into this because it has a great immediacy at first, some petty violence, some general shyster gangsterism in modern Paris. The filming is fast camera stuff, lots of disorientation alternating with closeups up expressions and other moments of peace and beauty.There are deliberate contradictions in the style because the main character is a giant contradiction. Played by the charming young actor Romain Duris, we are pulled into his real estate terrorism (extortion of various kinds, kind of low level mob stuff) and then into an utterly high brow pianism as he tries to return to the concertizing career he once considered. So we go from bashing faces in to playing Bach on a Steinway.This is great. I like the premise. This ends up being the only real premise, however. There are nuances--he sleeps with the opposing mobsters girlfriend as well as his best friend's girlfriend, he has a Chinese piano coach who knows no French (and he knows no Chinese), his father is a bit of a douchebag and yet the son tries to help with his mobster doings, and so on. It's pretty fascinating and yet it all ties to the one large idea of a man searching for his better self. So the problem is a story that has more meat and sense of progression to it. Yes, we eventually get to the recital tryout, as expected, but it's too expected. A little.There is problem in the filmmaking, too, and for me it is partly editing and partly overall direction, which leads in the end to a flatter character development than a movie like this demands. I mean, compare the characters to those in something like "Midnight Cowboy" or even the contemporary French film "The Piano Teacher" and you'll find a different way of building intensity and meaning. I'm also thinking Duris is more Richard Gere than Al Pacino, in terms of sheer ability.Because a lot of the effect of the movie is kinetic, or the opposite of kinetic (in the piano scenes), I recommend seeing it big big screen. Which I did. That propels the many scenes of violence and might help keep them from being redundant. There are unlikely moments (landing the girlfriend in the bathroom, even for a hottie like Duris, is taking improbable film noir detective sex appeal rather far), and in a highly realistic film, almost cinema-verite at times, this chips away at the whole. It reveals a feeling of being a movie built on movie-making tricks too often to pull you totally inside.See it? By all means. It has moments, it has interest, it has fun themes (like the language barriers throughout). It really had potential. But have some perspective on it, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course, we saw Fingers a year ago or so, the same film in its original American incarnation with Harvey Keitel. That was a much better film. Keitel had a better way with the piano, and his interaction with his father and gangsters was better portrayed. The musical part was much better and that made the story more interesting. The guy wasn't very believable as a potential concert pianist. The ending was better in this, though, the more positive outcome. And too much of this was in the dark, which took a lot of interest away from the film. It's hard to beat Keitel in acting. And his buddy staying away every night was a bit too much to take.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that shows a young man in his late 20s who is caught between an identification with his father (a corrupt businessman) and one with his mother (a pianist, who has died). Tom, the main character, is both. The linked characteristics of his parents in Tom are passion, energy, willingness to take risks, sublimated fierceness--everything that makes a great musician. The director studies Duris' face the way Bigas Luna did Olivier Martinez's in THE CHAMBERMAID ON THE TITANIC. The character is still a boy learning to play his life. Watch it for the pleasure of nuance in Duris' face -- it can be anything! -- and hi character's shifting moods or for the any of the many other elements of the film -- the power of music, the father-son relationship, corruption in business, a fine actor before he has been abducted by Hollywood!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I generally like French films, but this one is not very good. I think the good reviews are from people who want it to be brilliant, but it is actually poorly written and lazily acted. The violent parts are not believable and the transitions to the poetic piano player are more pretentious than realistic. The lead actor seems to be overwhelmed with the idea of an artsy performance, so he uses the minimalist approach. The director complements this concept with a silly, pretentious style. Another problem is the music itself, namely the piano playing. The playing style is simply not in keeping with the supposed level of the piano player. Some of the supporting roles are quite good, but the parents simply don't measure up in terms of gravitas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it is a special film. for music, for story as a puzzle, for performance of Roland Duris who escapes from adultescence roles, and, sure, for its director vision. because it is only a confession about dream and about reality, need to escape from a circle for be yourself. brutal, violent and poetic. intense. and useful reflection of a state of soul and small things who define every day frustrations. the American cinema touch and the essence of French cinema - this could be the key of a beautiful film about a fight with precise target. and the motif for discover The Beat that my heart skipped as a kind of revelation about art. not new, not original but touching and profound. as sketch of a way to the truth. remembering French new wave, it is one of films who gives new perspectives about existence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Old Passion Creates Conflict</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brief conversation (at the beginning of this movie) about the added responsibilities that can be thrust upon a son when the father is no longer able to cope as well as he had in the past, flags up a situation that has a strong bearing on the drama that follows. The son's loyalty makes him committed to looking after his father but also makes him feel trapped and then, when a passion from his past re-emerges (in this case, an ambition to be a classical pianist), it causes conflict within him as he tries to decide which way to go in his life and also causes conflict with his father who disapproves of his ambition.Thomas Seyr (Romain Duris) is a 28-year-old Parisian real estate broker who works with his partners on property deals involving run-down apartments which they buy and sell off at a profit. Their work often involves forcefully removing squatters, immigrants and even legitimate tenants that they want to evict in order to facilitate another sale. Where the people involved show any reluctance to move, various tactics, such as releasing rats into their homes or smashing their windows with baseball bats are used to change their minds. Thomas' involvement in this type of work and his propensity for violence are the results of his father's influence. Robert Seyr (Niels Arestrup) has a long history as a slumlord and has, for many years, used his son to collect unpaid rent by any means necessary.Thomas' mother, who'd died some years earlier, had been a concert pianist and he's pleasantly surprised one night when he unexpectedly meets Mr Fox (Sandy Whitelaw), who'd been her manager. Fox remembers the promise that Thomas had shown as a classical pianist and offers him the opportunity of an audition. This sparks an enthusiastic response in Thomas who, after a long period of neglect, becomes determined to improve his piano skills. After being introduced to Chinese piano virtuoso Miao Lin (Linh Dan Pham) who's a newly arrived immigrant in France, he hires her as his tutor. Despite her inability to speak French, they soon develop a rapport and Thomas works obsessively to be successful in his new endeavour, which he knows can lead him to a better and more fulfilling life.Thomas' new obsession causes problems with his business partners because he can't keep up with all his commitments to them and similarly, because his father is no longer able to handle the trouble he gets himself into as a result of his shady dealings, Thomas is increasingly called upon to sort his problems out as well. As a result of these conflicting pressures, Thomas fails his audition. However, a way then presents itself for him to achieve the better life he wanted through classical music, albeit by a different route than he'd originally planned.This movie's direction, cinematography and script are all conspicuously top class and Romain Duris' performance is exceptional. His explosive volatility when he's playing the thug, his understated interactions with Miao Lin and his unrestrained distress in anther key scene are just some examples of the power and range of his acting. The characters in this story are all particularly well-drawn with Niels Arestrup standing out among the supporting cast with his portrayal of Thomas' crude, overweight father who hasn't got the good judgement to know when the time has come for him to get out of his particular line of work. "The Beat That My Heart Skipped" is well-paced, violent and more affecting than many people might expect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Audiard is one of our finest artists.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jacques Audiard once again shows his mastery for exploring morally conflicted characters within a criminal world where the wicked succeed and the decent are thrown in the mud. In Read My Lips and A Prophet he gave us characters that tried to prevail in this world while still keeping their soul in tact, but here he does quite the opposite. Thomas Seyr doesn't try to prevail through crime; he treats it just like he would any other job. The real story for him, what he really strives toward, is becoming a pianist. This is such a beautiful and unique approach to this story and I knew almost instantly that I was going to get attached to this guy. When he's smashing windows and threatening people with a baseball bat, he stands almost in a daze, completely dulled by his surroundings as if it's just any other day. It's when he gets behind the piano that he comes alive, with all of the wonder and fear that comes with that.Actor Romain Duris and Audiard really make you feel every emotion that goes through Seyr during these scenes. The frustration when he gets something wrong, the anxiety when he's auditioning for a manager and the pure unadulterated bliss that comes when he just stops and lets his love for music flow over him. Audiard again proves his knack for beautifully staging certain scenes, this is shown in particular with all of the musical moments in the film. He also does this thing that he did in A Prophet where he distorts the image when some very beautiful moments are happening and it makes you take even more notice that something truly special is happening currently; be it for good or for bad. Everything with Seyr's love for the piano is what sold the film for me, but I thought that the romantic subplots were remarkable as well.Everything with his friend's wife was endlessly fascinating and let Audiard shed some great light onto themes of lust, betrayal, deceit and selfishness; the kind of possession and anarchy that can come with love. But what worked the most for me was the dynamic between Seyr and Miao Lin, his piano teacher who is also a Chinese immigrant that doesn't speak a word of French. The two of them together, thanks primarily to the performances from Duris and Linh Dan Pham, don't understand a word that the other is saying but somehow they are able to convey this kind of puppy-dog love that they slowly develop. Through the highs and lows of their dynamic they never understand a word that the other is saying but somehow they still know exactly what the other means. It's really beautiful to watch and further explores that theme of love that Audiard sets up to run underneath the whole story.The audition scene is staged extraordinarily and really hit me a lot emotionally, but what's even more impressive is how Audiard stages the final scene of the picture. Trying to talk about it could definitely veer into spoiler territory, so I'll avoid that just by saying that it was a moment made of palpable tension and Audiard really hammered this theme that the person you are sticks with you no matter what you try to do. You can escape your life, but the past will always come back and there are parts of you that can just never stayed bury forever. Somehow it will come back out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De battre... my opinion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"De battre mon coeur s'est arr?té" is not your standard gangster film. Usually, as with this film, one or more of our gangsters has some hidden sensitive quality but "The Beat" is definitely different.The Tom we witness as his ambition to become a concert pianist returns, is very different to the Tom we see pulling the deals at the beginning of the film. The music he plays is almost more moving because of this contrast with his other life and I think Tom's passion for this music is portrayed in a believable way.A gripping film that I think affects its viewers on a much deeper level than is immediately evident. A recommendation for anyone who's willing to get lost in a frenzy of property deals, sleaze and classical music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"From Jacques Audiard, the acclaimed filmmaker," notes the DVD sleeve, "comes this haunting new thriller that fuses two unlikely worlds to create a stunning portrait of a young gangster. Romain Duris, in a standout performance, plays Tom, a 28-year-old who seems destined to follow in his father's footsteps as a Parisian property shark working in a sleazy and sometimes brutal world. However, a chance encounter with his late mother's music agent leads him to believe that he can become, like his mother, a concert pianist. In earnest, he starts preparing for the audition with the help of a beautiful, young virtuoso pianist who has just arrived from China. She doesn't speak a word of French; music is their only exchange. But pressures from the ugly world of his day job become more than he can handle?" Strange how this film has found its way into my hands before the original, US-made "Fingers" (1978), starring Harvey Keitel; more often, the American re-make of a French film predominates. Probably, the reason is that Mr. Audiard's version was immediately acclaimed as the latest work from a superior director. Re-titled "The Beat That My Heart Skipped" for English readers, this is a nicely performed character-driven crime drama. Twitching and quivering, Mr. Duris is especially memorable as the unhappy degenerate who yearns for respectability through musicianship. Unfortunately, the "shaky camera" technique gets out of hand sometimes, distracting during a couple of scenes; mostly, the wobbling stays in the realm of a sway or bounce - even when the characters are not, of course. C'est la vie.******* De battre mon coeur s'est arrete (2/17/05) Jacques Audiard ~ Romain Duris, Niels Arestrup, Linh-Dan Pham, Aure Atika</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Struggling to find your own place after having grown up between two worlds so different you wonder how they could meet in the first place. Killing the father symbolically to reach the dead mother. Trying to catch up with a promising future you let go. Ending up living it by proxy. Finally being caught back by the world you managed to leave. Because no matter how much you feel far from a world you grew up in, it's part of you, it's constitutive by rejection or acceptation of what you became. Because you can't just turn your back and hope everything you want to ignore will disappear. Because you have to deal with your past to find a balance between your background and your expectations. Another one of those stories I cherish where it's about reaching yourself, stuck between two worlds. Also another piece where Audiard manages to make petty gangsters likable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Beat That My Heart Skipped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not all remakes are made in Hollywood; the industry works the other way round too. I haven't seen James Toback's 1978 film Fingers, but its French remake by Jacques Audiard surely works admirably. Tom (Romain Duris) is a shady young real estate broker who doesn't shy away from using violence to make sure his clients don't forget to pay their rents and other expenses. One day he meets the agent of his deceased concert pianist mother and is invited to an audition, as he has some musical talent himself. To prepare for the audition he takes lessons from a Chinese female pianist Miao Lin (Linh Dan Pham) and despite the language barrier, a wordless understanding develops between them. Combining the tough criminal career and the patience required for practicing music is difficult for Tom though, especially due to his unreliable father Robert (Niels Arestrup) who Tom often has to save from serious trouble involving dangerous criminals.Tom's restless wavering between the two careers is fascinating to follow, thanks to Duris' fidgeting performance full of danger and thinly buried anger. Even though he maintains a tough appearance, it is obvious that the audition means a lot to him, evoking memories from his mother even though we never get to see her on the screen. Niels Arestrup also captures the miserable aura surrounding the father and could have easily stolen the show from a less intense lead actor. Besides the acting, the overall directorial style is in tune with the story and masters both hectic urban scenes and the calmer moments at the piano in Miao Lin's apartment. The shocking but touching ending doesn't provide a simple conclusion to Tom's confusion, but suggests that he has learned that he cannot flee making the decision forever. All in all, the dramatically titled film succeeds in delivering a riveting experience and belongs among the better French film of recent years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>music as a chance for redemption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not see yet the last film of Jacques Audiard 'Un Prophete' which enjoyed great success in Europe I did however have the opportunity to see now (from the ARTE TV channel) this previous film that he directed and my feeling is that I have met the work of one of the most interesting and complete directors in the French cinema today.It is usually the European cinema that comes with the original ideas and the American Hollywood industry that creates the remake, with lesser or greater success. Here the path is reversed. A film with a very similar theme about the son of a Mafia head trying to break with the family and with the life of crime in order to get back to the classical music making that was his childhood passion was 'Fingers' made in 1978 by James Toback with Harvey Keitel making one of his finest roles ever. Here with the action is transferred in the Paris of today, the main role is being taken over by Romain Duris, a fine actor who succeeds to make us believe in his character fighting an almost impossible fight for redemption and evasion from his milieu, and especially makes us care about him.Duris is supported by a team of actors which is best selected and do a great job - especially Niles Arestrup as the young man's father for whom he cares, and from whom he must escape in order to have any chance to find a new path in life, and Linh Dan Pham as the Chinese pianist who teaches the hero music lessons in the tentative to help him get back on the track of art, without knowing any French. The scenes between the two, one speaking French , the other Chinese (with no subtitles) and communicating only by mimic and especially by music are both dramatic and moving. It's a solid drama and a complex film, but never a complicated one, so it's a real thrilling cinema experience to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thomas is a small-time hood, son of another small-time hood, who goes around putting rats in houses, beating up people and pushing out squatters as part of his illicit real estate business; but Thomas has another dream, buried deep inside until a chance encounter on a busy Paris street ignites his desires: he wants to be a classical pianist. The film explores the conflicts between his day-to-day job, his problems with his randy father who eventually gets himself in too deep with the much bigger and more brutal gangsters, his business partners, and the young Chinese woman he eventually finds to teach him to play the piano on a level that can get him an audition for his dead mother's former manager.It's based on James' Toback's 27-year-old American film "Fingers" which starred Harvey Keitel and which is much admired; I haven't seen the original but its hard to believe that Keitel was any better in the central role than Romain Duris (a look-alike for a young Daniel Day-Lewis for all you Brit-fanciers out there), who offers brutality, insensitivity and arrogance in most of his daily life, but with an undercurrent of melancholy and self-doubt that makes him one of the most real characters I've seen on screen in a while. I loved the look of the film; it's shot in Paris but you'd never know, it's all close-ups, cramped apartment spaces and dirty night-time streets, no scenery but the emotions on the expressive face of Duris and a few of the other characters.The film doesn't talk down to the audience, something I find very refreshing after a summer of blockbusters...the first few minutes are a bit chaotic and confusing and they mirror the troubled protagonist. I love that, though he seems at times to be making progress out of his unpleasant and violent existence, you're never quite sure...until the spectacular ending, where everything wraps up beautifully...or does it? See for yourself. Best new film I've seen this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful tale of redemption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nearly every modern French film boasts a leading actor who has a magnificent obsession outside of their professional life,have you ever noticed that? Frequently it's music,sometimes a quest for a rare item, rock climbing or even acting (that last one's a favourite for all the rather pretentious play-within-a-play options it throws up). This film ploughs the same furrow but the obsession in this case - the piano - is more than just a showy tack-on,it's the very agent of the protagonist's eventual redemption. Everything good in his old life relates to his mother who fostered his interest in playing the piano; his present of moral turpitude and anger he owes to the influence of his deadbeat father. "My heart stopped beating" is the literal translation of the French title ("The Beat My Heart Skipped" sounds more like exhilaration than spiritual stasis to me!) and surely relates to this period,after Tom's mother's death,where Tom's heart is moribund. His is a world that whilst not outlandish (he goes to bars,works in an office,has mates) is subtly killing him. Comparisons have been made with Scorcese's Mean Streets and the squalid but recognisable world depicted there and truly Duris does have more than a hint of the early De Niro - that disarmingly sweet face allied to a troubled often explosively violent character. His is a superb,nuanced performance,leading us in time to an understanding and an empathy for what at first appears a "lost boy", just as he comes to find what had been lost within his spirit. Magnificent stuff and proof that European cinema is still light-years ahead of Hollywood in terms of films that actually mean anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"De battre mon coeur s'est arr?té"(2005)...aka "The Beat That My Heart Skipped" written/directed by Jaques Audiard is a French remake of James Toback's cult movie "Fingers" (1978) with Harvey Keitel. The film tells the story of a young man Thomas (Romain Duris) who is torn by two different sides of his personality - one dreams of becoming a virtuoso piano player and the other - a ruthless debt-collector and enforcer. I think that Duris's was the one of the best performances of last year - so convincing he was as a man who walked on the edge of two realities. The best moments of the film are the ones between Thomas and his piano tutor, the girl whom he hired to prepare himself for an audition that was offered to him by a man who had been the manager of Thomas's late mother, the talented concerto pianist. The man remembers Thomas who had inherited his mother's talent and used to study piano seriously until his mother died when he was 18 and he joined his father in the "real estate" and debt- collecting business. The tutor, a young pianist from China who arrived to Paris recently, does not speak any French and Thomas does not speak any Chinese - so they have to relay to music to understand one another. The film is not perfect, and I am not too fond of director Jaques Audiard's frequent and abrupt cuts of the scenes but it is superbly acted, energetic, and well written.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish Identity Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has become customary for tired Hollywood producers to look for European art house successes which can be remade in a more commercial style. Think of Cameron Crows remake of Abre los Ojos (Open Your Eyes) as Vanilla Sky or Mike Nichols remake of Cage Aux Folles. The Beat That My Heart Skipped is a rare case of the reverse happening. After the success of Read My Lips, French director Jaques Audiard turned to James Tobaks 1978 Harvey Keitel vehicle Fingers, and remade it as an altogether more stylish and powerful film. Tobaks film, a favourite of Godard and Tarranino, is often through of as some sort of lost masterpiece and has been favourably compared to Taxi Driver. On revisiting it, I found it over plotted and over long, but an interesting and overlooked piece of cinema history all the same. The Beat that My Heart Skipped focuses on Thomas Seyr (a top notch performance from Romain Duris), who has followed in his fathers footsteps and gone into business at the sleazy end of the property development market. He and his colleagues daily routine involves planting rats and setting fire to buildings to drive tenants out. Sometimes they resort even more direct aggression and violence in order to get their way. A chance meeting with his long dead mothers piano teacher brings new meaning to his life?..Essentially it's a film about the age old Oedipus concept, as Thomas flits between the violent influence of his father and the artistic heritage of his mother. As he becomes more engrossed with his piano practice, so he is drawn away from the wheeler dealing lifestyle of his father and business partners. Soon he is dancing to a different beat. But is his piano playing good enough to offer him an escape route? Shades of Al Pachinos desire to concentrate on legitimate business in the Godfather perhaps, also parallels with Billy Elliot as Thomas goes against the grain of his contemporaries. After being promised an audition, Thomas starts visiting a young Vietnamese tutor, Miao Lin, who has recently arrived in Paris on a scholarship. Miao Lin cannot speak French and the strained communication between them parallels Thomas' struggle with his father and his own sense of identity. Audaird wisely chooses not to subtitle Maio Lins Vietnamese dialogue to further illustrate the frustration that Thomas feels. Good use is made of music throughout the film, periodically switching from techno to classical to illustrate the dichotomy of Thomas' world. Perhaps the most telling scene has Thomas, hands still bruised from "business" dealings, tapping out classical piano chords on a bar, while electronic music blares out in the background and his thuggish partners discuss how they are going to drive their next deal home. Audaird is quickly is making a name for himself for turning out well crafted, intelligent thrillers. From Tobaks source material he has retained the protagonists internal struggle with the self, toned down his misogynistic tendencies, lost a subplot or two and given us a more satisfying ending. Now the only question left is: who is the best one handed piano player, Keitel or Duris?!!!Patrick Bliss.</fullReview>

This came into my mind when I saw the film in question, where a guy wishing to be a pianist is engaged in various punishing measures within real estate business... Anyway, it seemed odd, and made the plot rather fictitious than reliable. Moreover, there were several expected scenes and solutions, an arid ending, and the main idea of focusing on the relationship between father and son was not elaborated fully. Even good actors like Romain Duris and Niels Arestrup were unable to "save the day", the others were not catchy at all. Thus, particularly as for a French film, I regard De battre mon c?ur s'est arr?té quite mediocre, and I am a bit surprised it has won a number of important awards; it is tricky to balance between harsh mobbing and sublime art in a short piece of work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was frustrated by a lot of aspects of this film, but was forced to take it seriously since it makes such an earnest attempt at distinction. Thomas Seyr (Romain Duris) is a real estate businessman in Paris. Well, he may be better described as a thug who is in the real estate business, since it is his modus operandi to locate low-end properties with potential and take unsavory actions, such as harsh evictions and physical destruction, so that the properties can be obtained at bargain basement prices. Thomas also is an enforcer for his aging father, from whom he has learned his trade. Overall Thomas' life is cause for much self-loathing, but he thinks he sees a way out by becoming a concert pianist. As a young man he studied under his mother, who was a classical concert pianist, and was recognized as having talent. When his mother died his father became dominant and his lifestyle prevailed.This is where I started to have some problems with the story line. Thomas, being about 30, was surely aware that there was little hope for his achieving his dream, particularly since he could not disengage himself from his life of petty crime and, more importantly, sever his ties with his father. The deepest theme of the movie concerns Thomas' relationship with his father and how he cannot escape his filial bonds. (Spoiler) The scene where Thomas discovers the body of his murdered father is a real mind bomb. Never have I seen a reaction to such a horrendous event filmed with more gut-wrenching realism. Duris earned his pay the day he filmed that.Thomas is more believable as a thug than as a pianist - he simply does not have the temperament of an artist. I wish both of the extremes of his personality had been toned down, like maybe his wanting to play in a local jazz band and having a somewhat base approach to his job that did not involve being physically brutal. The drastic dichotomy in Thomas' personality as presented is hard to believe. And would a world-class pianist like his Chinese mentor take Thomas on as a student? What was the relationship between Thomas' parents? Could a small-time thug and a talented concert pianist actually have made a go of it? Duris is excellent in expressing Thomas' internal conflicts. He is like a piano string ready to break. Miao Lin is convincing as the Chinese pianist and Niels Arestrup is particularly good as Thomas' disheveled father.Altogether there were more pluses than minuses for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>tremendous performance by Romain Duris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When he was younger, Thomas Seyr had a dream of becoming a concert pianist just like his mother but abandoned that goal when she passed away, taking the dream with her. Now, ten years later, Thomas, at twenty-eight, is little more than a professional punk whose job appears to be investing in shady real estate deals then using underhanded and sometimes even violent methods to evict those who cannot pay their rents or mortgages. However, one day Thomas bumps into his late mother's agent who encourages him to take up music again. With a renewed sense of purpose, Thomas begins taking lessons from a beautiful Chinese virtuoso while, at the same time, attempting to pull away from some of the more unsavory elements of his life (including his own derelict father who he keeps having to defend against recalcitrant debtors). But he soon learns that renewal and redemption are often easier to dream about than they are to achieve and that the life we choose early on is often the life we have to live with.In an unusual trans-Atlantic turnabout, "The Beat That My Heart Skipped" is actually a French remake of an American film (it's generally the other way around) - in this case, James Toback's 1978 "Fingers." Set in Paris, this is a subtle, low-keyed study of a man fighting the demons of his own personality while trying to turn around a life that has veered perilously off its original course. Working off Toback's original screenplay, writer Tonino Benacquista and co-writer/director Jacques Audiard avoid making their points with heavy-handed melodrama, choosing instead to show us Thomas as he goes about the routines of his hectic daily life. Wisely, the film rarely makes moral judgments about the character; it merely records his activities, then allows us to size him up based on what we see. The fluid hand-held camera style employed by Audiard and cinematographer Stephanie Fontaine makes it feel as if the events were unfolding extemporaneously - that what we are witnessing is life caught on the cuff as it were. The filmmakers also don't find it necessary to tie up every loose plot end or coddle us by taking the storyline where we in the audience think it should go."The Beat That My Heart Skipped" would not be the success it is without the riveting performance by Romain Duris in the lead role. He brings such an intensity of focus and so much nervous energy to the part of Thomas that we cannot take our eyes off him for the entire hour-and-a-half-plus that he is on screen. He makes a morally ambiguous character both repugnant and strangely appealing at the same time. This is one of the strongest acting jobs of the past several years, in a film that provides a rich character study along with much fine classical music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must state from the very beginning that I have not seen "Fingers". Some critics keep praying it and saying how much greater it was. Really? I haven't heard of it so far (not that I am much of a film connoisseur!). I am a normal human being who went to the cinema to see a film very hard to tell friends about without blushing (because it has such a poetic title, lyrical, as some put it). These are just my impressions.The moment I went out of the cinema hall, I though the combination real estate mobster - gifted pianist was highly unlikely in any case, but rendered almost believable by Romain Duris. I thought he was a brilliant actor. I watched and couldn't believe it, an actor of the same rank as Daniel Auteuil...can't think of a young American actor to match. He DID render the whole thing believable, because I am not a fan of classical music either, and I had that music from that film in my mind ever since. Anyway, I see the film as a story about failure. You realize that you are on the wrong track and you want to go back, you do everything in your power to gain your former self, but you ultimately fail. And that is, I think, when his heart stopped beating. When he failed the audition. I think, in a metaphorical way, it stopped beating forever afterward, although he kept on living. But this is my own pathetic and pessimistic view. My friend, who saw the film with me, said the title refers to his emotion when he sees his mother's former piano tutor. I guess that's a more optimistic view!oh and I forgot the most important thing. It is equally about totally mad and insane courage to turn your life around as it is about failure, and it should be praised for showing that. In 9 American movies out of 10 the lost hero decides to take life in his own hands, strives and struggles and fights, loses days and nights and sweats and spills blood and...surprise! He finally wins, his effort is rewarded! How comforting! Let's just take a bow for a moment before a film which DARES show that actually, in these situations, in 9 cases after 10, YOU LOSE. And have to live with that, as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie over the weekend with my girlfriend. We watched with subtitles as neither of us speak French. And aside for a few moments of being at a loss (more because we're American and its a French film), it was a great film. It's a story of a relatively successful young man in the real estate business. His father had to beat up clients to make them pay the bills. His deceased mother was a pianist. Happening to come across his mother's manager, he is provoked to regain his early talent at the piano. The movie documents his travels in learning to play the piano all over again and his life along this path. With his father and colleagues pushing him away from the piano, he gathers more steam. But his day job keeps him away from his "hobby" as everyone puts it. He gets increasingly frustrated with dealing with everyone else's problems and not being able to pursue his own challenges.This is the type of film that ends and you are not sure if he reaches his goal. But you know that he is happy at the conclusion of the film. My only qualm? I don't think a single scene goes by without a cigarette being smoked. But then again, I think most of France has a cigarette lit.</fullReview>

I'll try to propose watching the movie in my french class. I can only hope that Audiard movies grew bigger and bigger in ambition and craftsmanship, in a time where good crime movies are barely seen in and out Hollywood. Great film, and great title.

		<shortDescription>Sounds like a big artsy cliché but avoids the genre traps and sentimentality that it could have fallen into to produce something much better and more convincing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thomas Seyr is a real estate broker; by which I mean that he plants rats, threatens, uses baseball bats and forces people out of properties so he can get them cheap and sell them on. A chance meeting with his late mother's manager brings back his interest in classic piano, with the prospect of an audition for Mr Fox. He finds a music tutor in Miao Lin and, despite her lack of French, gets her to gradually make him better. Meanwhile though his day job suffers as he becomes unreliable and his relationship with his father puts him under greater strain as he tries to use his violent career to help him out of trouble.I must confess I approached "De Battre Mon Coeur s'est Arr?té" with reservations because I could only see it taking a rough criminal and using music to make him a better person, while at the same time the language barrier between him and his teacher is broken down by the music to produce true love. I have made it sound terrible and I did worry it would be all artsy and deep. I needn't have worried because this film manages to pretty much deliver elements of the story I expected but to mostly avoid being clichéd, genre-driven and, well, up-its-own-arse. The story does do what you more or less expect but by avoiding these traps it is much better than just the direction of the story. Thomas becomes a different person but not necessarily a better one and I liked this approach because it made it a little bit more convincing. Likewise his relationship with Lin is not as corny as I feared and is actually quite a small part of the story ? this is about Thomas, not the "romance opened by music".As such the film is driven forward well by the life and character of Thomas; he doesn't get better with time or the music and if anything he uses the "refreshing" and "invigorating" power of the music to sleep around and let down friends. The story doesn't really miss a step and the only reservation I had was the sudden "two years later" conclusion ? although even that still worked pretty well. The direction is roundly good, although it took me a minute to get used to the hand-held nature of the whole thing. Plenty of good shots come out and Audiard does well to shun the clichés and easy sentimentality of the story in favour of sticking with his main character. At the screening I attended the subtitles seemed to slightly blur upwards but I got used to it quite quickly. The cast are roundly good and all come over as very natural and convincing. Duris dominates the film ? never being an "appealing" character but still holding my interest really easily. He is pretty intense and at the same time he understands his character well enough to prevent him just being an easy performance. Support is roundly strong from Arestrup, Zaccai and Dan Pham and they do well to stop any weak parts distracting from Duris.Overall this is a very strong film that does more or less what you expect it to but manages to avoid all the cliché traps that are so common with this type of thing. The direction is strong and the performances all do well to deliver strong performances while avoiding the sentimentality and easy character traits that they could have just delivered. Well worth seeing ? don't be put off by what sounds like a big movie cliché because it really isn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw "The Beat that my Heart Skipped." Stunning. Honestly, I was getting a little sick of the French cinema that they feed us here in London. It's extreme. On the one end, there's shock cinema (Baise Moi, A ma Soeur, and Trouble Every Day). And these are only the female directors. On the other end, you've got hyper romantic crap like Amelie.But, this film...romantic, gritty, redemptive.Spoiler Alert: don't read on if you haven't seen the film.As soon as you meet thuggish protagonist, Thomas Seyr, you just know it is going to end badly. You feel it with all of your being. So you settle in for a depressing descent into French existential nothingness. But, director Jacques Audiard surprises. The film takes an all together new route. He helps you to access universal feelings and emotions is wholly new and exciting ways. Every sequence is brilliant. There is no wasted effort. And as gritty and gripping as the film gets, at it's heart it is a love story. Loved it, loved it, loved it. Also check out "Read my Lips" by the same director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Silences within the Psyche of a Life in Transition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'De battre mon coeur s'est arr?té' ('The Beat that my Heart Skipped') is another superb and delicate character-driven film from French writer/director Jacques Audiard ('Read My Lips') and his collaborator Tonino Benacquista. How this director can take such potentially fragile subjects and create enormously powerful and indelible characters would indicate that he is one of cinema's truly important artists.The story evolves as Thomas Seyr (Romain Duris) is seen as a member of a real estate scam working with smarmy associates who buy and sell buildings at the expense and eviction of poor tenants. The work is distasteful but Thomas is following the lead of his father Robert (Niels Arestrup), a man on the skids who depends on Thomas to do his 'collections'. Thomas loathes the work but is devoted to his rundown father. We discover that Thomas' mother, a former concert pianist, is dead when Thomas encounters his old piano teacher who urges him to practice despite his ten year absence from playing and to audition for a new career. A light of hope goes on in Thomas' psyche and he is lead to a Chinese immigrant pianist Miao Lin (Linh Dan Pham) who takes him on as a pupil to prepare him for his anticipated audition.As Thomas practices, his world of crime does not abate and he is intermittently pulled away from his passion for the piano by his old partners as well as his father's continuing need for his 'dirty services'. He is torn between the life he has been leading and the promises of a career with his mother's (and his) passion for beauty in music. When the partition tenuously separating these dual lives is broken, Thomas struggles to find his way back to music. The ending is unexpected and keeps in step with the verismo of the screenplay.Romain Duris is a major talent and delivers the kind of performance that indicates he is becoming a powerhouse of an actor. But the real star of the film is the director who knows how to relate a glimpse of a man's life in subtle, quiet ways despite the accompanying background of violence. It is a delicate balance and Jacques Audiard makes it work. Highly recommended. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Betting the ranch on a charismatic actor works sometimes but not here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake of a 1978 James Toback film, "Fingers," in which Harvey Keitel played a crook who aspires to be a concert pianist. In "Beat," Tom Seyr (Romain Duris) is also a thug. He deals in low-end apartment house real estate, which frequently requires him to chase out tenants who would otherwise stay indefinitely under tough Parisian eviction rules.He and his buddies release rats into buildings, bash windows and toilets with baseball bats, and otherwise terrorize renters into beating hasty retreats to assure the success of impending building sales. And Tom tries to keep in touch with his dissolute widower father Robert (Niels Arestrup), who is also a nefarious wheeler-dealer.Tom's more cultured late mother, we can surmise, kept these two guys from descending into the gutter, while she was alive (we never meet her ? there are no flashbacks in this film). She had been a successful concert pianist before her death a few years earlier, and Tom himself learned piano under her influence.Now, his chance meeting with her former manager results in an invitation to audition. But he's 28 and, though he still noodles around on his piano at home, he hasn't practiced seriously for 10 years. Still, he feels a pull to follow in his mother's footsteps and make something better of his life. So he finds a teacher - a recent immigrant from Beijing, Miao Lin (Linh Dan Pham) - who schools him uncompromisingly to prepare for the audition.The resolution of this story is at once both inevitable and surprising, but the film turns on Duris's energetic, cat-like, springy presence in virtually every scene. He's forever on the move, and with his short fuse and inscrutably smug little smile, one never quite knows what he will do next. Just that it will be quick and decisive.For anyone even peripherally familiar with musical performance, it requires an unacceptable level of suspension of disbelief to think that this musical slacker could within just weeks polish his chops to a soloist's level of proficiency. The thought of it is pure nonsense.Duris is interesting enough to watch, but I was disappointed in this film, and not because of the absurdity of the conceit about musical performance. My hopes going in were high because of Jacques Audiard's earlier highly suspenseful films, "Read My Lips" (2001) and "A Self Made Hero" (1996). I thought that the male leads in those two films, Vincent Cassel and Mattieu Kassovitz, respectively, were both more intriguing than Duris is here.For that matter, if you want my nominee for the most tightly wound, electrifying male performer of the year, it isn't Romain Duris, it's the Turkish-German actor, Birol Ünel, who plays Cahit in the astonishing film, "Head-On." (In French, English, Mandarin &amp; Russian). My rating: 7/10 (B). (Seen on 09/05/05). If you'd like to read more of my reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful for fans of brooding French dramas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... but not necessarily something that will appeal to a wider audience. Romain Duris puts on an impressive performance as an apparently amoral landlord who finds his human side when he decides to revive his ambition to be a concert pianist.The drama unfolds nicely, with the would-be ivory-tinkler struggling to accommodate his day job (releasing rats to scare off unwanted tenants and suchlike) alongside his lessons with a teacher who speaks not a word of French.His father, another ruthless landlord, and his adulterous friend's wife also appear in subplots, but ultimately we are waiting to see if Duris's character can pull off an audition, or whether he will be sucked under by his clashes with debtors and rivals.The result, and the epilogue, provide interesting surprises, but this is not a film that fizzes with excitement or tension. Personally, I found it uninvitingly dark and the main character off-puttingly unsympathetic. Duris is watchable none the less and those who like their dramas broody will take to this like a Frenchman to a high-tar cigarette.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unlikely yet credible contemporary gangster drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the huge success of his A Prophet as last year became this, it's worth a detour through Jacques Audiard's back catalogue. The cryptically titled The Beat My Heart Skipped concerns come of the same themes that made A Prophet a tense - and epic - cinematic tale. Romain Duris is a temperamental young wheeler-dealer in Parisian real estate, fluent, if not happy with the murky aspects of his trade. Serendipity produces a remarkable plot diversion: offered an audition by a former piano teacher, he begins lessons with a Chinese girl who speaks no French, and finds the process emancipates him from the tawdriness of his day-to-day.Naturally the drama builds as the civilising effect of his extracurricular pursuit and that very job come into conflict. I liked the way in which Audiard managed this though. I also liked the way in which he dealt with the pianism within the film. This is a notoriously tricky area, introducing music or sport, events which have their own inherent drama. The non-Francophone teacher is a brilliant conceit in this respect - since we do not understand the Chinese (non subtitles) the drama moves from dialogue about the piano to the physicality of the exchanges between the characters.Of course, so much more revolves about this - like El Djebena, much of the drama comes from expecting Thomas to drop one of the many balls he's juggling - women, providing alibis for adulterous friends, the fractious relationship with his passée-thug father. A nice selection of supporting roles, from the wonderful Niels Arestrup as said dead-beat papa to the echt Parisian beauty Aure Atika as Aline maintain the verisimilitude easily enough. This is Duris' picture though. He performs with such a convincing equivocation that there is no second- guessing the script and we feel sympathy even in his foolhardiness and violence. A very good, if (also characteristically) rather pessimistic film. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There cannot be too many incidences in which the Europeans have taken an American film and remade it with the considerable amount of success that The Beat That My Heart Skipped achieves. Off the top of my head, one European remake of an American film that springs to mind is 2001's Mean Machine, but that's pretty much where we'll stop with that particular example. The film combines that heartfelt feeling you get with that genre linked to the passing of time in one's life, be it a tragic or triumphant one with a careful study between the lead character and his father while incorporating elements of the crime and romance genres but retaining the subject of music at its very core.The film reminded me of Craig Brewer's 2005 film Hustle &amp; Flow, that being about a criminal or one of society's lowlifes at best who uses music as not only a means of escape emotionally but as an escape literally when he decides to embark on a career as a songwriter-come-rapper. At the very centre of The Beat That My Heart Skipped is a character who I suppose we're to believe is full of musical talent and that talent is linked to the playing of the piano. But the talent goes seemingly wasted as the lead, Thomas (Duris), has his mother die at a very early age leaving him worse off than what he was. Very quickly, it seems, he must balance taking care of his father named Robert (Arestrup), a burden he talks about and introduces in the opening scenes, as well as his erratic and spontaneous job that frequently involves conflict with unknown elements.The film seems to be about nurturing but it carries a music related theme. Very early on, characters talk about having to take care of someone and the pros and cons that come with that. The dialogue is spoken by Thomas and he is referring to his father but he is someone who himself has neglected to nurture something else quite important; obviously not to him but certainly inside of him and that is the talent and interest in piano playing.Thomas' interest in music has evolved from his early years in life but it retains that consistency in the sense it is still instrumental music he is interested in, only it has changed from classical piano sonatras to contemporary electronic music. It is the feeling of moving on in one's life and in music from the past; retaining that joy we get from hearing a solid piece of music we enjoy but in an alternate form. Thomas' love for interacting with the music also lives on, he frequently plays out mock drum routines with his hands and wrists which I guess are meant to resemble his long since buried piano skills he bears with his fingers. Indeed, his father berates him for his choice in musical fondness in a scene more poignant that it first comes across as.Thomas' job is one I did not catch the specific title of but needless to say, he slithers from location to location in ominous fashion, rounding up squatters and unleashing vermin into particular apartment tenants whom are not exactly pleasing the housing firm he works for. The job is juxtaposed with the piano lessons he takes up following a chance encounter with his old teacher, whom convinces him to do an audition for him at a set date. The film's drama to do with these lessons spark from the fact he is retracing steps and being forced to confront demons of old. Listening to old tapes of himself playing for his mother are the scenes that hit home. Twinned with this, his Vietnamese teacher by name of Miao Lin (Dan Pham) doesn't speak his native French and the communication is patchy at best, creating not only the threat of potential confrontation but allowing the lead to interact with a member of the opposite sex.The film's spine revolves around Thomas trying to balance his own life with that of his father's. It's very true to say that his crime-orientated job along with his piano lessons and the threat on the horizon that is the audition work really well combined. In addition, his father is involved with a loose woman and the fact he is owed money from a shady Russian gangster just complicates things to the point it'll act as a huge catalyst for Thomas later on in the film.One of the film's crowning triumphs lies in it getting that last act just about spot on. There is a blend of optimism and tragedy as we are lead to believe he's one thing two years down the line but the success has come to somebody else and the ominous scenes of potential retribution are once again juxtaposed by scenes of piano playing and piano music. We get a fabulous performance out of Romain Duris who's playing a character one thing after being something else and then going back down a route similar to the one that made him what he once was. The blend of content and the hybridity of the genres complement one another rather than clash resulting in an often harrowing, often uplifting and mostly very engaging piece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Beat That My Heart Skipped is a quick-paced, jangly ride of a movie, juxtaposing scenes of visceral violence with quiet moments of artistic longing. Romain Duris holds the film together, the unlikely premise only succeeding by virtue of his riveting, multi-faceted performance as the tarnished Tom.Tom comes across as nothing more than a sneering, chain-smoking thug until a chance encounter with his former piano teacher reveals his past musical ambitions. Reflecting on his veering away from music, he surmises, "After Mum died, things got complicated." The economy of that line, revealing a whole backstory of grief, turmoil and opportunities squandered or lost, is symbolic of the film as a whole - there isn't a wasted line, scene or shot.Tom's fractured relationships define him. A colleague uses him as a diversion to cheat on his wife, then the wife in turn uses Tom (at his prompting) to exact her revenge. His music teacher does not speak French, so they make do with a handful of English words, or shouting past each other in French and Vietnamese when the tensions rise. It is a simple metaphor for our failure to understand each other, and ourselves.Tom's father; selfish, bloated, self-obsessed, is a prescient figure revealing the man Tom could become if music fails him - or he fails music. The horrific resolution of their troubled relationship, revealed visually, allows Duris to perform full-throttle, and he rises sublimely to the occasion.The camera eschews postcard shots of Paris, sticking closely to the characters, often in extreme close up, and letting you feel the dirt gather under your fingernails as you participate in their squalid lives. I use the plural loosely here - it is pretty much all Tom, as the camera stays with him throughout.The hand-held camera can cause queasiness at times, but it never gets too obtrusive. In terms of composition and editing, there are counter-poised moments of quiet and chaos. The pacing never lets up as Tom lurches from one unresolved situation into another. The film belongs to Durin as Tom, however, whose artistic barbarian nature is compellingly portrayed - and in true anti-Hollywood style, never truly resolved. An actors' film it is, and all the better for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Great Achievement For Jacques Audiard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** SPOILERS *** I liked him even before SUR MES LEVRES (READ MY LIPS). He had directed a film called UN HEROS TRES DISCRET, a sort of French FORREST GUMP starring MATHIEU KASSOVITZ, ANOUK GRINBERG, and SANDRINE KIBERLAIN, which was another beautifully-crafted film from this director.These three are all superb and in all of them, what I admire the most about his films is on display: he has a command of the image and both the dynamic cinematography (most often shrouded in darkness, in medium plan or close-up) and the elliptical editing contribute to the narrative thrust of his stories. There is an energy and a fluidity about them that glue you to the screen. Electric, moody.KASSOVITZ, VINCENT CASSEL, and now ROMAIN DURIS are his ideal (anti-)heroes as the characters they play share a common trajectory: somewhat marginal by the films' beginning, they seek (consciously or not) to integrate into the mainstream, into conventional society.DE BATTRE MON COEUR S'EST ARRETE is another impressive achievement for AUDIARD as he manages to make us feel for his protagonist even though he starts out as unlikeable. DURIS is angsty, nervous, impulsive, always on the move -- dealing with scumbags by day while pining for the quiet serenity of a Haydn piano sonata at night. That Audiard and Duris succeed in making such a dichotomy work is a credit to their craft.That last fight in the stairs was just a beautiful piece of macho aggression. Raw, visually stunning -- perhaps only CLAIRE DENIS could've come up with images as uncompromising...A must-see. Now, I'm looking to see the original FINGERS...</fullReview>

But instead of watching "The Beat that my Heart Skipped" to see a rare French remake of an American film, watch this film to see one of the most gripping acting performances of the last several years. Romain Duris, playing a very different character than he did in "L'Auberge espagnole," is absolutely phenomenal: he takes a role that could be (based on the plot summary) corny and sentimental and makes it gritty and believable.While you're watching, notice all the unusual camera angles that highlight the general feeling of instability that the main character is experiencing.Who knew that beating people up with frying pans and playing Bach could be so compatible?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Toccata and fugue in A flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering how often Hollywood re-makes French films, I guess it's only fair that a French film-maker should re-make an old American number. Jacques Audiard, who made the excellent "Read My Lips" in 2001, has here produced a French version of James Toback's hard-boiled but rather odd "Fingers" (1978) in which Harvey Keitel stars as a loan shark's collector who aspires to be a concert pianist. Here, a rather more handsome Romaine Duris stars as Thomas, a real estate developer (a lower form of life than a loan shark in France, it seems) who also aspires to the concert platform, following in the footsteps of his late mother. Thomas meets by accident his mother's former manager who, remembering Thomas's talent as a child, suggests he audition. Thomas hires Miao Lin, a Chinese pianist studying at the Paris Conservatorium to show him how, though she speaks no French. In the meantime his chaotic life lurches on; he continues to evict tenants and squatters, do dirty deals, come to the aid of his aging and disorganized father, and help his partner to deceive the partner's wife.Yet strangely his playing improves until Miao Lin, a lady of very high standards, compliments his playing, and he fronts up for the audition to play a Bach Toccata and Fugue in Morris Minor, or whatever. It would be unfair to tell you the rest, but suffice to say it's not a fairy story, and Glenn Gould went mad trying to get the Toccata and Fugue right.Although this film has some of the elements of a thriller, as well as a rake's progress, it is essentially a character study of a fairly odd guy. Thomas has a curious relationship with his dissolute and not very charming father ? their roles are almost reversed. He is contemptuous of women yet submits to Miao Lin's authority. He is not a nice person yet the viewer would like to see him climb out of the mire.Well, if the portrayal of real estate ethics in France is anything like the truth I sincerely hope I never have dealings with a French real estate agent. I found the film engrossing but Thomas was hard to identify with. Of course great artists are not always nice people but in his case he works too hard at being nasty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dark Character Study of A Thug Who Wants to Be a Contender -- in Classical Music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Beat That My Heart Skipped (De Battre mon coeur s'est arrete)" is a dark, intriguing character study of a son caught between loyalty to his corrupt, landlord father and his dead mother, a classical pianist. From an opening monologue by a friend about filial responsibility, we see first his violent following in his father's foot steps, then his sudden epiphany as he is reminded of his mother's life.While Jacques Audiard, director/co-adapter, from James Toback's film "Fingers" (which I haven't seen) also crafted the twisty crime story "Read My Lips (Sur mes levres)," this is not a thriller but is reminiscent as a similar thug out of place in a white collar world who tempts another into it, this thug is tempted to fit into the high culture world.No wonder his mother "had fits", according to the subtitles, when married to his dad, who expects the son to threaten his deadbeat tenants, demanding more such physical proof of loyalty as the son confesses his re-immersion in classical music, that the dad frequently derogatorily refers to as the province of homosexuals. Though his intense loyalty to his dad precludes an Oedipal interpretation, it is a gentle, lovely scene when he finds and listens to a tape of a rehearsal by his mother.Romain Duris, previously seen in the U.S. just for his gorgeous looks in lighter fare "L'Auberge espagnole" and "Le Divorce," could do for classical piano what Liszt did in his day. The costume designer must have loved clothing his bifurcated look, from black leather to the surprise when he is transformed into suit and tie -- especially when that shirt gets unbuttoned. I was reminded of Marlon Brando in "On the Waterfront" wanting to be a contender instead of an enforcer, but boxing is a more common career pairing than this somewhat naive quest to be a concert pianist as an altogether different use of his hands. He wends his way between these jarringly opposite career paths through constant negotiations and revenge, until he sees everything as a deal and everyone as having a price or is a prize in a competition, including women.Around religiously practicing the piano each day, he is simultaneously trying to move up just from routing immigrant squatters to clear development cheaply to doing more complex, shady investment deals, but gets screwed by his partners, so he screws them back, literally through their women. The seedy corrupt world of illegitimate real estate development and loan sharks, the kind of money laundering deals featured in "The Sopranos" that go from head busting to silver-towered banks, is viscerally evoked. He so doesn't see how odd the two parts of his life are that it is amusing when he frankly explains to the concert promoter's assistant what he does for a living with no conscience about his extra-legal tactics or violence.The only possible link we see between his two lives is his intense, almost meditative listening to rhythmic, pounding electronica music.We visually see the strain of him leaving his violent world for the piano in his fascinating interchanges through only music and body language with his Chinese coach, as he has more difficulty relaxing and being in touch with his emotions than with technique. The film does lay it on a bit thick about music as the universal language, though in effect it's only Italian music instructions, like "legato" that they can verbally share.The closing shot shows how he bizarrely integrates the two parts of himself, but the coda is a bit odd. Duris is so captivating that he makes it all make more visual sense than logic.There is an amusing side theme of immigrants to France who start out not speaking the language, leading to frustrating and even dangerous miscommunication, but who in two years, in the coda, have succeeded beyond the Parisians. I'm not completely sure what the title is referencing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pianist rage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>French cinema remains the home of adult orientated films that look at modern life. Here the life in question is quite European, as the anti hero Tom is both "geek" and "bully".The connection between the classical piano gift that Tom recognised while growing up clashes with the thug he has now become. The thug prefers to listen to pop, but the pianist sometimes has angry frustation. His father reminds him of his pianist mother, but also of the jobs he must still do to keep his fathers business afloat.The ending is one of the better resolutions I've seen, although I would have been happy to see more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Duris excels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It isn't often that a film contains a character so effectively created that they alone are enough for a film to work, but Romain Duris in 'The Beat That My Heart Skipped' gives an excellent account of the character Thomas. Reminiscent of De Niro in Taxi Driver, Duris proves himself to be a more than adequate actor with much to offer cinema in the coming years. His brooding aggression and visible battle between morals are enjoyable to experience. Not only has Duris managed to fully immerse himself with the character, he has also created a character that we want to see succeed.The film itself is clever. With an engaging plot and simple but defined characters, the audience are easily transported into this world of petty crime and testosterone. Duris steals the show though and I look forward to watching him for many more years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why make a film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The interviews included on the DVD release point up a central difficulty with this Jacques Audiard movie -it shouldn't have been made in the first place.He states that a producer approached him to do a remake, after that guy recently remade John Carpenter's ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13. Rather than turn him down flat (or pitch a more original notion), Audiard acquiesced and chose of all things, James Toback's FINGERS to re-do Gallic style.OK, I don't like the concept of remakes, but given how old (and tiring) that whole debate is, let's give them the benefit of the doubt. But Audiard enlists a previous collaborator (Tonino Benacquista) to script with him, and we find out Tonino didn't like Toback's film at all, and didn't like the notion of remaking it.So far, so bad, but the coup de grace is both men asserting they've kept the themes and main character (Harvey Keitel's memorable pianist/gangster) but jettisoned the rest of FINGERS. Fine.Finished film annoyed me thoroughly and repeatedly. It would take more than 3,000 words (triple the IMDb limit) to catalog the missteps or downright cheats committed here, but I'll chronicle just the most alarming. Audiard lost me from the outset with the edgy, jittery hand-held camera -so corny now through overuse, and quite distracting. Midway through the film he has a lengthy conversation between star Duris and his partner in crime in which he switches to traditional over-the-shoulder reverse shot closeups. BUT, Audiard consistently crosses the center line and violates the most basic of editing rules (Filmmaking 101), causing their heads to bounce back and forth from left to right side with each cut. Total incompetence.Audiard's explanation of why he chose Duris to star (boiled down, it's "flexibility" in approaching a surface/external character) is OK. But Duris really wore me down, a boring, one-note and pointless performance. He's a big star in France, and suitably charming/sexy (I enjoyed the fluff that was HEARTBREAKER), but I don't see any acting chops there at all. His smugness on screen reminds me of that stand-up comic London Lee of 3 or 4 decades ago, whose routine was to smirk and make fun of how rich and wonderful he is (sort of the opposite or Rodney Dangerfield, turning self-deprecation humor on its head). Duris is in virtually every frame of Audiard's film -too much of a bad thing.The simplest of boy/girl relationships in BEAT MY HEART (now there's a better English-language title!) are bungled. When Duris professes out of nowhere his love to Aline, the wife he's been facilitating a colleague's cheating on, she hops into bed immediately, falling for that line. It's filmmaking on the level of late night skin-shows made for cable, a pernicious "short cut" to sex approach that has infected lots of movies and TV -take for example the silly, wham-bam sex sequences in the British TV turkey trilogy RED RIDING. Similarly, his having his way with the poor little Russian plaything of a gangster is ridiculous. And no more ridiculous than him finally confronting said gangster in a crudely done ("2 Years Later" card inserted as the height of bad script structure) and corny epilogue.I can't even get started with the hokey (but central) subplot concerning hero's dad Niels Arstrup. This is not just mediocre 21st Century filmmaking but meretricious slop. A film industry where remaking Toback movies is considered OK is artistically bankrupt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it's supposed to be a remake of 'Fingers', a movie I haven't seen, it's much more like a slick retread of Clifford Odets's 'Golden Boy'. Which could well be the source of 'Fingers'. Nothing about the film makes sense and the juxtaposition of music and violence is the kind of thuddingly literal symbolism that gives French movies a bad name. Interesting how the director strives to capture an entirely derivative 'authenticity' by trying to make Paris look like New York. The image of thug developers and victimized squatters is the sort of social commentary one saw in London in the 70s and as a plot engine in this work is laughable. The erotic complications of the characters are preposterous and seem completely arbitrary. The music is almost interesting. But the symbolism of the teacher who speaks no French and the student who speaks no Mandarin so that they can only communicate via the piano is right out of Lerner and Lowe.Leaving aside all the other improbabilities, we are supposed to believe that a man who aspires to play the piano would ever risk his hands by beating people up. The only reason I can see for this is to make the hero some kind of tough guy, he-man instead of the kind of wimp who might actually care about music. And the whole plot seems to hinge on a chance encounter between the hero and his dead mother's agent. Or he planned to meet the agent. But if he did he wold have no way of knowing that the agent would invite him to audition so we're back to chance.The incomprehensible title gives a perfect clue to the tone of the film. Tripe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Halfway in I knew this movie was in trouble. I wrote it off as European cinema, meaning there is no plot, just aimless scenes that have no bearing on the film.Here are a few things that aren't tied up: the subplot with his love friend's wife, what really happened with his father, his own business dealings with a piece of property. They're just dropped. "Plot snot" I could hear the French director say. And the French wonder why Hollywood movies dominate theirs.But to my shock, this was a remake of Fingers. I've never seen that movie, but I've seen a few others from Tobak, the writer. And I can honestly say he's probably the worst writer/director in America. Totally pretentious, completely untalented. He's a hack who can't tell a decent story. So it kinda makes sense that they the French would remake this. Well, a copy of feces is still feces. Congratulations France, you copied a total turd! Ha ha! Jokes on you.Avoid this movie at all costs. You can't get your 2 hours back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here we go again on the road to nowhere. A leading man who's clearly been frightened by Vincent Cassell and strives to give the impression of loosely contained violence. He has a nice line in intimidation, throwing sacks of rats into tenement properties to encourage the tenants to leave so the property can be re-let; meanwhile his father is little better, having crossed the Mafia for which he pays dearly; the old man is played by Niels Arestrup so it's not a total waste especially as his new girl friend is Manu Devos, who copped a Best Actress Cesar in Audiard's last movie Sur Mes Levres (which co-starred Vincent Cassell, surprise, surprise). Anyhow it seems our leading man was once a dab hand at the classical piano before he let his life drift away from him so he's not all bad. Tired message, tired movie, do yourself a favor and give this one plenty of room.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>French cinema pleased with itself. Once and again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm trying to understand what those guys had in mind before the movie was put into production. The producer must have been pleased enough yet to cradle the new opus from a Great Film Auteur. The auteur himself ? He must have been pleased with the sample of a premise he had with the central character. That must be it: Jacques Audiard said in an interview he wanted to make a movie far less written than his previous directorial effort (Read my lips). What do you call that? Experimenting a new creative workshop or indulging in pretentious laziness? No, it's just a French disease: the auteur attitude. People keep telling you you're good and you end up believing them and then half your brain goes to sleep.So there's Thomas, he does nothing with his life and certainly no good. Then Thomas gets the feeling he can do better. Not better in a spectacular way but anything that might strip him off his nihilistic way of life is welcome. OK. But his inner conflict is so flatly described the movie never pulls off. You know, this is the kind of movie where the director is pleased with his own sympathy for his loser of a hero. The director shoots him in a sympathetic way but you never empathize. Why? Because the director fails to get the lively thrust of this character in the frame. Audiard quotes Il Bidone as a reference. Well, I'm sorry this is a perfect example of Fellini's failure to take his sympathy for losers off the ground. Sympathy might be a good starting point but if you keep playing that note over and over again till it's time for a conclusion, I suspect moviegoers will feel the movie doesn't deliver.At best - or if you think you're here on a mission to pump up French auteurs - you can say the storytelling is smooth. But there's no storyline. Everything is linear, nothing builds up from a previous event and the noir mood is supposed to swallow the episodic nature of the whole thing. Oh yes, something occurs that makes Thomas think he should catch up with his buried past of a promising piano pupil. It's not even an anecdote. And then... and after that... Yes it flows. Yes it goes nowhere. As most French films do when the boys in charge have come to think either they're big fat auteurs or nice little respected artists. In the meanwhile fewer and fewer people go to the movies.</fullReview>
