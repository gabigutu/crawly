		<shortDescription>A really strange and disturbing masterpiece of hilarious nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though this is one of my all time favorite movies, I would still have to give it 7 out of ten because it has too many flaws for me to rate it as a perfect film. For one, the plot does meander and great deal. Also, the characters for the most part are pointless and annoying. Still, this does not matter in the world of Herschell Gordon Lewis. This is easily one of the stupidest, most unbelievable, disturbing and hilarious movies that I have ever seen in my entire life. You'll find yourself laughing out loud as you vomit at the sight of people having swords shoved down their throats, being done in with punch presses, being chainsawed in half and every other disgusting thing you can possibly imagine. Only in the world of cinema can things this ridiculous happen. That's what I love about movies, they take you into a different world, and this movie does just that. Aside from the gore, what really makes this movie stand out is it's evil villain 'MONTAG THE MAGNIFICENT'. After watching this movie, my friend Jason and I decided to start worshipping him and revelling in his badassness. Also, what totally rules about this movie is just how terrible the acting is. Ray Sager is actually the worst actor of all time. It made me laugh the entire time I watched it, yet at the same time his presence has an unnatural creepiness to it. The ending has to be seen to be believed.Truly a unique horror film that should be seen by fans of bad cinema or just anyone who wants to be totally grossed out and given nightmares.(My personal rating is 10/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HEADS off to see the wizard...the nauseating Wizard of Gore!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another sensationally over-the-top splatter party directed by everyone's favorite horror lunatic; THE Hershell Gordon Lewis! "The Wizard of Gore" might not be his 'best' film, but it's definitely a fun experience and actually one of Lewis' most ambitiously plotted films, since he toys with subjects like hypnotism and optical illusions. None of the magical tricks are properly explained, as Lewis' sneakily avoids that in the dumb finale, but at least he tried to do something extra and ingenious with this film. Ray Sager, some sort of crossover between Vincent Price and porn actor Harry Reems, plays Montag The Magnificent; a self-acclaimed illusionist genius who butchers girls from the audience live on stage but has them return to their seats again in one piece. A young reporter, who's always dragged along by his girlfriend to see Montag's shows, discovers that the girls turn up dead after all and their corpses are damaged exactly like they appeared to be on stage. It's rather curious how you never grow tired of the way Lewis displays the gore in his movies! The sequences here in which female bodies are disemboweled, impaled or even crushed with an industrial punch press are overlong, monotonous and completely implausible, yet you stare at the screen with a gigantic smile on your face. Of course, these are the only significant scenes in "The Wizard of Gore" as the rest of the film hangs together by lousy acting, embarrassing dialogues and a shortage of decors. By the year 1970 and after having unleashed a handful of similar horror movies already, Lewis still couldn't care less about building up tension or continuity and went straight for exploitative grossness. The least you can say is that his work is an acquired taste, but he shall be forever worshiped by drive-in fanatics and other sick puppies, like myself. Amen, Mr. Lewis?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some say the Wizard of Gore is one of HG Lewis' weaker flicks, but I must disagree. Blood Feast may have been more ground-breaking and unintentionally hilarious, but W.O.G. stands up fine against that movie and any of his other gore films. There is a certain cheesy charm to Lewis movies, no matter if they are skin flicks, gore flicks, or even kiddie flicks. In this movie, the wonderfully hammy Ray Sager plays the Wizard and his main occupation seems to be delivering quasi-fascistic prattle to audiences with mutton chop sideburns, interspersed with running his fingers through the tomato-sauce covered animal organs that erupt from his victims, all to the audience's delight. There is some weak storyline involving an independent woman reporter and her well-tanned boyfriend, who try to solve the mystery of the Wizard, the fools. However, this is pretty much just window dressing for the 5-6 gory scenes of the Wizard doing his thing. In particular, there is an eyeball poking and manipulating scene that would have done Lucio Fulci proud. And please don't forget the awesome furniture and late 60's bourgeois home furnishings and polyester pantsuits that make all of these late 60's films look like "Barbarella" by todays standards. If anything, you have to love the fact that there was actually a time in this country where you could make a movie like this and it would be distributed. Thinking about the time period when Lewis was doing his thing and the way he was doing it is enough to blow your mind even more than his movies. If you haven't checked them out, you are doing yourself a disservice!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My personal favorite H.G. Lewis film, one of his goriest and most surreal offerings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wizard of Gore" is one of the legendary H.G. Lewis's goriest films. Its also one of his most interesting, as the plotting is rather ambitious, touching upon concepts such as hypnotism, meta-fiction, and illusions. Despite none of these themes being explored with anything resembling subtlety, its certainly an adventurous move for Lewis. To his credit, the ending is unforgettably bizarre. It also makes this one of his most surreal efforts, and in my mind his finest achievement. Sure, "Blood Feast" and "2000 Maniacs" are more groundbreaking and have larger followings, but this is the Lewis film I find myself watching the most.If you were actually fooled by what I said above into thinking this is a technically adequate film, well, I'm sorry. This still features all the Lewis trademarks, and fans of the godfather of gore wouldn't have it any other way. As the lead, Ray Sager is hilariously over-the-top, coming across as Vincent Price without the talent or the dignity. Wayne Ratay as the reporter working on the case is pretty wooden (not to mention he takes off his shirt one too many times, this isn't exactly a buff guy). Judy Cler actually offers a half-decent performance (by Lewis standards anyways). As I said above, this is one of Lewis' goriest films, and where the guy actually had some skill was staging memorably morbid death scenes utilizing bizarre props. They're cheap, but they're sometimes effective and unnerving (if also hilarious and monotonous). Lewis' direction hasn't improved too much (he never really got the hang of pacing), but for fans of drive-in trash, "The Wizard of Gore" offers much entertainment. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the great "what the..." movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Utter madness from HGL and probably his most accessible and entertaining film. The central premise is brilliant - someone should remake it - but all the weird subplots and scenes all add to the deranged atmosphere.The gore is pretty nastier and a definite progression from A Taste Of Blood and The Gruesome Twosome. The "eyeball" scene really surprised and shocked me because for once the effects are reasonably convincing. But it's Ray Sager's pompous portrayal of Montag that is the most appealing aspect for fans of kitsch and the ending is a genuine eyebrow raiser. Questions of existentialism and hardcore gore? It's all here. You will, at some points, question your sanity. That is, of course, if we're not all a figment of someone's imagination. Indeed, are you in fact sitting reading this review now? Or are you actually at home, asleep, dreaming that you are here? Aaaaagh!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are 6 women in this silly thing that get bloody parts pulled out.Its a completely worthless bunch of cinema, the lowest level of product designed to fill drive-in double features. I have to admit that there is the possibility of a clever idea at the end, but its all so random you can't put anything together.I suppose its interesting that all six of these women, plus the only other woman in the thing (a waitress who screams) are redheads.Now normally I would drill into this and purport that there is some significance to this. I surely did with "Peeping Tom," a real movie where all the women were reds. But that was made by someone we know paid attention to every detail (and who had a redheaded lover).Here, if you listen to the commentary (a commentary!) you'll learn that these were girls he picked up off the street for 20 dollars. Its just an effect of the class and time I suppose. It takes a certain type of woman to agree to stuff chicken parts and fake blood in her mouth and then do her only scene by spitting it out.But if you reach as I do, even here you will appreciate the slippery way the plot moves in and out of nested realities: shows, created realities, TeeVee, imagined romance, dreams. Its actually cool, but not in the exciting way that Ed Wood's realities bend. Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lewis Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a kid, I couldn't get enough of the Horror genre. Renting Horror flicks, on the weekend, from everywhere from Blockbuster to the smaller places like Video Warehouse. It wouldn't take too long to plow right through every Friday The 13th, every Elm Street, and yes, every watered-down Halloween disappointment, among countless others. Eventually, it would come to my attention that there is a whole other universe, an alternate universe, if you will, of Horror. I had discovered the wonderful world of vintage B-Horror. You know, stuff like Basket Case, Messiah Of Evil, and Burial Ground. Needless to say, it didn't take long to discover the ground-breakingly cheesy flicks of good ol' H.G. Lewis. Known mostly for his earlier stuff like Blood Feast and Two Thousand Maniacs, Herschell Lewis would later go on to make a movie that really stood out for me. One of the goriest, and might I add one of the least well-thought-out Exploitation flicks of the 70's. This is The Wizard Of Gore.I sure am glad I like gore, because magicians are kinda lame. And if nothing else, this 1970 gore-epic teaches us this. If you like 'em unrealistic and confusing, then I assure you, you will approve of this lame-brained story, which involves, you guessed it, a magician. Montag The Magnificent. Played by Ray Sager, a man 30 years younger than what the role calls for. No problem. Nothing a little white spray-paint and fake-looking, uneven white eyebrows can't fix. Ridiculous-looking eyebrows are the least of Montag's problems. Because this guy is rude, irritable, kinda loud, and just plain unpleasant. In other words, Montag is a real bummer. This old codger, who is clearly in a bad mood, spends the first 10 minutes of the movie explaining to everyone why his magic doesn't suck. None of that "saw a woman in half" stuff... Well, actually, that's exactly what's gonna happen. Except it's gonna be authentic, and gory as all hell. And basically, it's just gonna be real, except this chick just gets up and walks off unharmed. So, that's basically why Montag's magic doesn't suck. Montag, as a person, on the other hand does suck. because the "magic", or whatever takes hold later on in the evening, and said chick literally falls apart, in all her gory glory. No cgi here, gang. Just excessive, fake-looking gore, complemented by awkward, inept acting along with the usual stupid dialogue. It was beautiful, I tell you.And might I add, the old, grainy VHS that I had originally seen this on was much more suitable for a movie such as this. The cleaned up pristine look of the screen totally ruins it, in my opinion. However, owning a movie you love on DVD is kind of necessary, considering all the cool little extras involved. The commentary being a good example of that. In the audio commentary, Herschell makes mention of his disdain for this film, which is funny considering he's the guy who made How To make A Doll and Blast-off Girls. And now this should be the part where I warn you of the evils of the remake, from a couple years ago. I could present my own separate rant, dedicated to my hatred for this film. Instead, I'm just gonna let you know that I only made it about a half an hour through, and let you make up your own mind. what a shame that Herschell's next film, The Gore Gore Girls would turn out to be his last for 3 decades. Herschell's long-awaited next project, Blood Feast 2 would end up 10, or hell, even 11 times gorier than anything he'd done before. As if things couldn't get any better, I would imagine a DVD release for Herschell's next film is right around the corner. So, if you happen to dig lewis, you may want to keep an eye out for The Uh-Oh Show!, starring Lloyd Kaufman, and the legendary Joel D. Wynkoop. But first things first. If you've seen Blood Feast and/or Two Thousand Maniacs, and you got the Lewis fever, The Wizard would be the next logical step. Passionately recommended to Gorehounds, young and old. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So-Bad-It's-Good Definitely Applies Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has been on my Netflix queue for quite a while so I can safely say that I've wanted to see it since before Juno was out. This is the fourth Herschell Gordon Lewis film I've seen so far and only the second I've liked, the other was Two Thousand Maniacs. This, much like Two Thousand Maniacs, is a good movie. Not because it actually has substance and is well thought out, but because it is a lot of fun to watch and has become a cult classic.Let's be honest for a minute here, when Herschell Gordon Lewis was directing films, he had no idea what he was doing. As a friend of mine said "he is the Ed Wood of gore films." I have to agree completely. The editing is always choppy and horrible, the music is poorly placed, the acting seems to be straight out of a junior high play, and nothing seems believable. This brings me to the gore. If HGL only got one thing right in his career, it was gore. The gore in this film is awesome and cheesy. He may have made bad films, but they sure are entertaining.Sorry for going off on so many tangents, I'll get back to this movie. The story follows a TV reporter and her boyfriend who attend a magician's show of blood and dismemberment. They become suspicious of several deaths being linked to the show. It's a simple story but it is a lot of fun. I really like the magician theme. The bad acting factor definitely applies in this movie. I often wonder where HGL found these people. But as always, the gore is magnificent(no pun intended) and almost saves the movie. I had a lot fun with it.See this movie if you're a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis and you won't find much of anything new but it is a very good time. Go! Now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Herschell Gordon Lewis goriest and dullest movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Wizard Of Gore' is one of H.G.Lewis' goriest movies but it is also one of his dullest. More explicit than any of the "blood trilogy" which his reputation rests on, but without a tenth of the entertainment value. In fact I'd say it's even worse than his non-gore turkey 'She-Devils On Wheels'. At least that one had one or two laughs. Ray Sager plays Montag The Magnificent and could be Lewis' most wooden leading man (which is saying a lot!). He plays a magician who causes a sensation by dismembering female volunteers on stage then apparently making them whole again and none the worse for it. However afterwards the girls turn up dead, injured as they were in his "illusions". An ambitious TV talk show host (Judy Cler) and her sceptical sportswriting boyfriend (Wayne Ratay) try and solve the mysterious deaths and determine just what, if anything, Montag has to do with it. Some people seem to inexplicably rate this snoozefest very highly, but if it was the first H.G.Lewis movie I'd ever seen it would probably be my last. The acting is terrible as expected, and the gore is ridiculously unconvincing, but this time round the plot drags, and I found the whole thing terribly unamusing. For Lewis beginners I'd recommend you avoid this one and go straight to his hillbilly horror 'Two Thousand Maniacs!'. It may not be as in-your-face as 'The Wizard Of Gore' but it is a lot more fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey People,I can't believe this is what you had to write about this film. OK, the acting is bad - but it is also hilarious. The frames are not normal - but they have a very queer charm. The effects are very unreal, but this is part of the ideology. The crowd is not shot together with Montag. But really, why be picky. This is also part of the laugh (and this film is very funny). Ok, so Herschell, didn't have much money. So what?Monatg had me panicking. No, this is not only about gore. This is about destroying the line between illusion-cinema-reality. About viewing and seeing. About the conscious and sub-conscious. We all take part in Montag's horrible show.I watched the film with a few friends, and we all liked it a lot, but I guess I am the only one who really has nightmares ever since. I don't know why. This film touched some very deep point in my psyche probably, but I can't get over montag. Over the horror of the girl screaming her pain and the crowd not hearing cries.Watch it (10 Points!)Ido,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Wizard of Gore" is typical of Herschell Gordon Lewis--the in-your-face eviscerations where innards are strewn about with wild abandon is the signature of his work, yet what comes off as completely unexpected (and quite surprising) is the surrealistic turns this film takes. Granted, Lewis doesn't give us an existential, Bergman-esquire meditation on the meaning of life, but he infuses some clever camera tricks and mystic concepts that put reality into question. The plot centers around a boisterous illusionist/hypnotist named Montag, whose specialty is finding elaborate methods of simulating murder on-stage, only for the female volunteers to later wind up dead via the exact methods (sword-swallowing, head-hammering, chainsaw evisceration, etc.). Granted, Lewis stalls out in fully realizing the tenuous link between fantasy and reality, but at least he tries, which merits "The Wizard of Gore" an extra star in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My third H. G. Lewis watch, following on from COLOR ME BLOOD RED and 2000 MANIACS. THE WIZARD OF GORE is easily the worst out of the three, a simply awful, interminable Z-grade movie that features non-existent plotting and a wearying running time. The "plot", although you can't really justify it as such, involves a sinister magician who carries out a series of gruesome illusion murders on women, only for them to die the same way the same night.In reality this is just an excuse for a series of laboured gore effects in which graphic violence is meted out to distressed women. Thankfully the special effects are so poor that this isn't as sleazy or misogynistic as it sounds. Eyes are pulled from papier mache heads, hands are thrust through bright-red guts and swords are thrust down bleeding throats. In order to wring every drop of blood from the premise, Lewis disposes of continuity completely and repeats the same effects over and over, from different angles.Aside from the gore, next to no effort has been made on the script and it really shows; between the effects shots, this is as deathly boring as they come. The actors have been evidently recruited from a local theatre troupe and there's no creativity present in any of the long-winded dialogue scenes. In its own way, THE WIZARD OF GORE is just as tiresome as the many Hollywood blockbusters which rely on CGI effects and CGI effects alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid, boring and just bewildering</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magician Montag the Magnificent (Ray Sager) performs illusions of murder in front of audiences. In his show he cuts a woman in half with a chainsaw--but she's perfectly OK minutes later. However, soon after leaving the show, she drops dead cut in half. Another woman gets a spike driven into her head...but is OK. Still, after leaving the show, she dies when her head opens. TV host Sherry (Judy Cler) and newspaperman boyfriend Jack (Wayne Ratay) knows something is going on...but what? What a lousy picture! There's not one thing done right. For starters the plot makes little sense and REALLY derails at the end of the picture. The dialogue is ludicrous (the speeches Montag gives before his illusions are unbelievable), the gore is so laughably fake it's impossible to take seriously and the direction is (at best) uninspired. It also has a music score that appears and disappears with no rhyme or reason. Some people love this because it was done by Herschell Gordon Lewis (who did other "masterpieces" like "Blood Feast" and "2000 Maniacs"). He's been crowned the Godfather of Gore (he was making gore movies WAY before anyone else) but it doesn't mean his movies are any good! Boring, sick and makes no sense (especially at the end). Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Bad It's Good...Um, Really?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one is definitely in the "so bad it's good category" except, of course, for the fact that it's not at all good. Herschell Gordon Lewis is a cult figure in the world of horror and exploitation films. His 'Blood Feast' and 'Two Thousand Maniacs' are famous examples of his "craft". Both of those films, I have to say, are better than this one. At least Two Thousand Maniacs has that toe-tapping "And the South will Rise Again" opening song.Wizard of Gore is of course a terrible TERRIBLE film. But it will raise more than a few smiles, which is why it fits nicely in the "so bad it's good" basket. But then again it's so deathly boring! Between each outrageously gory yet incredibly fake-looking murder scene are stretches of dialog and ham acting that beggar belief for sheer boredom. At least the Wizard himself (Montag the Magnificent, played by the illustrious Ray Sager) is entertaining for some of the WORST acting you've ever seen in your life. I wanted to slap him and scream 'spit your lines out man'. He lingers over every lame sentence; each and every word is delivered so painfully slowly and painfully badly. Seriously, your DAD could act better than this. And you've seen him try on those few rare embarrassing occasions after a few too many beers at a family barbecue. Well, that's how bad Ray Sager is here! The gore scenes are rightfully notorious. Well, if someone fingering entrails (the local butcher's finest) and grinning salaciously is what qualifies as gore. There's plenty of guts on display but it's hardly convincing. Actually, it probably couldn't be LESS convincing. Especially considering after each shot of the viscera being fondled we cut back to a full shot of the victim without a drop of blood on them, let alone guts hanging out. The sword swallowing scene is particularly badly done. The actresses almost seem to giggle at times. They know how ridiculous it all is.Aside from Montag's on-stage gore fantasies, the highlights for me are: his Mesmer stare (with powdered eyebrows that don't match the ones he usually 'wears'), which supposedly represents him hypnotizing his audience or a hapless volunteer; the journalist with the crime scene photos who visibly glances at someone off camera several times, perhaps to read his lines; the way the victims suddenly fall down dead after the show in the most awkwardly edited ways...I could go on.So, yes, it's a WOEFUL film, but it's so bad it's an entertaining watch. But, really, it's just awful AWFUL film-making in every department. Be prepared to fast-forward through all the dialog and everything in between Montag's eyebrow close-ups. The only thing Mr H. G. Lewis had in spades was gumption. And a big-a** pair of "cojones". I hope one day to see some of his nudist camp movies!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My first experience with this film was the scene in Juno when she came across the tape in her baby's future adoptive father's collection. The scene that the film showed was none other than the world class Punch Press Trick. Something about the scene, with all the blood and retro early 1970's grainy film, made it stick in my mind for years after until I finally decided to watch it just recently. It centered around Montag the Magnificent, a magician whose dark powers was the top of their time. While the audience views a clean, harmless illusion, Montag slaughters his pretty female with immense gusto. Yet after the trick, they hop up alive and well. That is, until they show up dead only a few hours later. Meanwhile, a female talk show host tries to get him on her show, unaware of the trick he has prepared for her. It was strange, very strange. All the gory, violent scenes were hazy nightmares filmed on stock that made it look as if I was watching it through a millimeter thin sheet of red tissue paper. Even the scenes in between, dealing with our plucky (some would say pesky) heroine and her obsession with Montag had a certain surreal feel to them that bled over from the stage acts like blood leaking from the attic. Even its flaws, operatically bad acting, blatant plot holes that make Inception make sense, seem to work for this movie. By the end of it all, you feel as if you're waking up. You aren't sure what you just saw, but you know that it's in your head now, probably for good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deranged small-time magician Montag the Magnificent (a gloriously histrionic performance by Ray Sager) murders female volunteers from his audience in assorted gruesome ways on stage and passes off the atrocious killings as "illusions" in his lurid stage act. Snoopy talk show host Sherry Carson (the pretty, but hopelessly wooden Judy Cler) and her drippy boyfriend Jack (the extremely insipid Wayne Ratay) try to stop Montag. All of notorious goremeister Herschell Gordon Lewis' entertainingly sloppy and low-rent hallmarks are present and accounted for: a plodding pace, hilariously horrendous acting (Sager in particular totally hams it up with unrestrained eye-rolling relish like some kind of bargain basement Vincent Price), a slight script, a general air of pervasive lethargy, chintzy cinematography, a heavy-handed illusion vs. reality theme, badly dubbed in screams, a groovy swinging score, a ridiculous surprise ending, and, of course, loads of hideously graphic and excessive carnage (gross highlights include a gal being cut in half with a chainsaw, a metal spike pounded into a woman's skull, another lass getting split open with a punch press, and swords being rammed down two ladies' throats). Sure, this flick is without a doubt complete garbage with zero artistic merit to speak of, but it's this movie's very artlessness that in turn makes it such a lovably lousy marvel to behold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So the movie starts with a magician who is doing some lame tricks and then he picks a woman from his audience to chop in half. It ends up being shocking to the audience because he uses a chainsaw and he doesn't even have her inside a box. After his gory trick, and after the woman is fine, she ends up dead. This couple ends up seeing the show night after night and it gets weird and the end is really weird. It's not that great of a movie but it's fun and really fake. Watching this guy play in the fake guts is pretty gross and then I remember that the guts are fake and laugh. It's so strange that even the movie is an illusion because they used dolls and it's just a cheesy but fun movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This might have been an excellent short. And it works wonderfully as a fetish movie if seeing young women getting tied up and mutilated is your cup of tea. As a feature movie it's just dire.Unusually for a horror movie, it features a young professional woman in one of the leading roles -- and she doesn't even get raped and mutilated in the first five minutes for being a harlot! She investigates a magician who performs gory tricks in his show, with the same girls he performed his tricks on later dieing accordingly. This repeats itself no less than four times (if I counted correctly), each scene lasting maybe ten minutes and being as linear as train tracks in a desert, until her boyfriend muses: "All those girls who went on stage in the show died in the same manner later in the evening. Maybe there's a connection?". His girlfriend is so impressed by his cleverness that she proceeds to fornicate him out of gratitude -- and rightly so. It was the most intelligent moment of the entire movie.I'm not asking for too much, am I, here? I just want to be entertained. For that, I'm willing to forfeit good taste, intelligent plot, competent acting at the door. In the Wizard Of Gore, though, Herschell Gordon Lewis reveals himself as a gore fetishist. The premise of blurring reality and imagination may be interesting, but it's never developed into a story. Fail!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird B-Grade Gore Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clearly the only reason one would watch 'The Wizard of Gore' is for the gory aspect of it for it is pretty much a poor film in every other aspect such as execution, acting, score, writing etc. Yes, there are too many plot holes, very bad acting and abysmal special effects but it does succeed in being gory, even though the scenes of torture and maiming are too obviously fake, it invokes disgust or laughter (at the cheesy way it's executed and portrayed). I found the ending twist to be a bit strange. 'The Wizard of Gore' is one of those campy films that has attained cult status. I was referred to it by another movie and since I am fascinated by gore in films, I decided to watch this. Yet, it could be watched as a film that's so bad that it's funny. Yes, there is plenty of unintentional humour for those who want a little more than visceral violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A dreadfully repetitive script, coupled with an abysmal central performance from Ray Sager as the titular character (who delivers every last syllable of his many boring monologues in a drawn out manner guaranteed to irritate) make Herschell Gordon Lewis's The Wizard of Gore a real chore to sit through at times; however, several delightfully outrageous moments of cheesy Grand Guignol splatter and a jaw-droppingly daft ending thankfully prevent it from being a complete waste of time.Curvacious Judy Cler plays Sherry Carson, a TV talk show host who becomes intrigued by mysterious, mesmeric magician Montag the Magnificent (Sager), who uses his hypnotic powers to lure female volunteers to take part in incredible illusions in which they appear to be mutilated and killed on stage, but are finally revealed to be very much still alive.When these same volunteers are found murdered not long after the show is over, with wounds that match those inflicted by Montag during his act, Sherry's boyfriend, a sports reporter, becomes suspicious and alerts the authorities. But the police are unable to tie the grisly murders to the magician, and so Montag is free to continue his act, with his latest and deadliest performance to be broadcast live on Sherry's TV show...Montag's messy on stage antics?sawing a woman in half with a chainsaw, removing a girls brains after hammering a spike into her head, using a punch press to squish a lady, forcing swords into throats, and gouging out eyeballs?just about compensate for the terrible acting, poor editing, and a script that leaves so many unanswered questions that it even feels compelled to mention them all at the end. Unsurprisingly, Lewis is unable to deliver many satisfactory answers, and so opts instead for a WTF finalé that somehow transforms The Wizard of Gore from a gleeful slice of low-budget splatter into a totally whacked-out piece of existentialist horror cinema.Now that's what I call a trick!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Wizard of Gore" isn't much more than a confusing gore opus.**SPOILERS**Dragged along to a magic act, sports columnist Jack, (Wayne Ratay) and his TV hostess fiancée Shelly Carson, (Judy Cler) go along to Montag the Magnificent, (Ray Sager) perform his show. For his final act, he does a variation on a standard illusion and looks to physically saw a woman in half without doing so in a box. Afterwards, the volunteer appears fine only to be found dead later on with a wound exactly as it appeared during the performance. Getting curious, she asks him to appear on her show and perform there, to which he agrees and asks them both to appear at future shows. When a series of murders begins taking place where the volunteers begin dying in the same fashion as the illusion they perform in the show. Getting suspicious, they finally lay a trap for him during his TV appearance and try to solve his mystery once and for all.The Good News: While there wasn't a whole lot of good things, what was there wasn't bad. The film's biggest claim is the high amount of gore on display from the different illusions. These certainly are pretty graphic ones, with one chainsawed in half in full view of the audience, a metal spike shoved into the side of the head, swords shoved into the mouth and down the throat, one set on fire and another pressed into a whole with a metallic press, among others. These are all quite brutally done and manage to look possible as well. That's a fantastic trick to accomplish and this one does it nicely. The film's only other positive point is the really nice conclusion. This is where the film picks up it's pace and intensity slightly from before, allowing for a little more excitement and thus brings the film up slightly. The film's real power, though, lies in it's powerful illusions and extreme gore.The Bad News: While this one wasn't that bad, there's still some pretty big flaws here. The fact that the extreme gore here terrible and completely unconvincing is something to get over. The pressing illusion is the big one to get over, as the fact that the blood comes out as thick, gloppy mess is just so wrong that the disbelief at it outweighs the graphicness of it. It's the wrong color, shape, form and even its action that it takes, as real blood doesn't behave in that manner. It's just way too noticeable to be shocking or convincing, and the act that's being taken to drive the blood is where it gets it's impact from. The near incoherent plot doesn't help matters. This bounces around from scene to scene quite frequently, rarely tying up any loose ends left from the previous scene before raising a new one from that sequence. This gives the film a really disjointed feel, moving around as much as it does and then it goes ahead and finally solves the mystery at the end, only for the film's real remaining questions to be brought up by one of the characters in conversation with another and the whole thing then dismissed. It's not that smart of a film to do such a maneuver, and this one is no exception. Otherwise, this wasn't that bad.The Final Verdict: One of Lewis' more watchable films, this one though adds in the extra fact of a confusing story along with the traditional trademarks. Highly watchable for gore-hounds or Lewis fans, while those who aren't or find the flaws to be deal-breakers, seek other viewing.Today's Rating-R: Graphic Violence</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the worst thing Hershell Gordon Lewis ever made....though that certainly isn't saying much!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I have read countless accolades for many of the gore films of Hershell Gordon Lewis, I found the "gore" in this film to be incredibly stupid. Sure, there was a lot of fake blood--but the gore?! It often consisted of obviously fake mannequin heads and cow guts that just looked nothing like people guts. Perhaps in 1970 people thought this was realistic, but today with improved technology and an increase in the level of gore in films, this and other gore films of Lewis just seem dumb (despite their receiving a plug in the recent film, JUNO). This isn't to say every one of his films was bad...just all but 2 or perhaps 3. 'Genius' is a word way too casually used for Hershell Gordon Lewis. I prefer to use words like 'schlock-meister' or 'wizard of crap'.In this film, a stage magician specializes in gory tricks. He saws women in half or drives spikes in their heads--and yet they are just fine after the trick is complete. Oddly, hours later, they collapse--dead with injuries sustained from the tricks--as the injuries re-appear. The problem for me is that the guts are just stupid looking and the guy starring as the magician (Ray Sager) is a truly awful actor. Sager yells his lines and annunciates in a strange manner--and sports hair that looks like it was colored white using White-Out! This act comes to the attention of a local TV personality and her reporter boyfriend. She wants to book the magician on her show and later he wants to investigate him because all of his stage volunteers keep coming up dead hours later. It all culminates in a TV appearance where he tries to use his evil psychic powers on everyone in the studio AND at home! And, when it ends, the movie actually isn't quite complete. There are lots of mistakes made due to the little-known fact that Lewis is a lemur--this would explain the sloppy direction. Here are a few examples: the woman who collapses dead at a restaurant is still clearly breathing, the newspaper that you see at the 43 minute mark looks nothing like a real paper (the font and style are all wrong) and you can see the different cut and pasted portions peeling off if you pay attention.There is a tiny germ of a good story here but because the entire production is so sloppy and stupid, I can't recommend it to anyone except bad movie fans or those who actually believe that Lewis could direct. I could also see that many see this movie just as misogynistic as it's a film showing contempt for women as you see them hacked to pieces. But, considering how bad and stupid and poorly acted it all is, most who MIGHT be offended might just instead see the whole thing as a waste of time as opposed to something patently offensive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While its strange, mystical sense of suspense aids it, this movie is pretty mediocre in all other aspects, and yet I still find myself enjoying it. It's got terrible acting, bad picture quality and shaky, flawed transitions between scenes (and even stranger ones when it tries to demonstrate the Wizard's "power"), but it's still enjoyable. I wouldn't call this a horror movie so much as a strange combination of fantasy and gore, but it fits my Halloween bill well enough. The Wizard of Gore doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but then, like Phantasm, it isn't really supposed to.There is a 2007 remake of this around, and I might just be inclined to check it out, to see what modern film-making could do for this little gem...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Montag the Magnificent (Ray Sager) is a talented illusionist that has devoted audiences on his staged show and each show always has an new trick up his sleeves. He gets audiences participations from the lovely ladies but after the gory trick is done. His participations dies sooner or later. Now a TV talk-show hostess Sherry (Judy Cler) and her boyfriend Jack (Wayne Ratay), who's works the Gazette newspaper. They become curious with the tricks of Montag the Magnificent, especially Sherry. Who wants to interview Montag for her TV show but Montag promises a trick for the TV Viewers. While more dead bodies are coming up, these victims died after watching Montag's show after several hours. Sherry and Jack are trying to find out how these woman gets killed, while Jack believes that Montag is the real killer somehow but he can't prove it. Now they have solved the case with the help of the cops, before it's too late.Directed by Herschell Gordon Lewis (Blood Feast, Something Weird, Two Thousand Maniacs!) made an somewhat enjoyable guilty pleasure horror trash. Which i admit the premise is quite interesting. The gore effects are quite successful and shocking at times, for its time. But the acting is quite awful, despite a game cast. The directing is pretty bad with couple of moments of a few obvious goofs, using doubles at times and mannequins also. It is unintentionally hilarious most of the time. This horror film certainly has a cult following and it was recently remade with Cult Actor:Crispin Glover playing "Montag the Magnificent". I guess, i could tell why this film has some respect from the die-hard horror fans and it has also a weird charm too. As a Horror Fan, there's some entertainment in store here. But it certainly doesn't appeal to everyone. Worth a look. (***/*****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was my first Herschell Gordon Lewis movie, and it was certainly entertaining.Surprisingly (for me at least) the acting wasn't that bad. One notable exception was Montag, who had to exclaim or yell every line. Still, this made his character quite funny and captivating, so it could be seen as a plus.The gore was very over the top, but other than the short scenes on the stage, there wasn't that much more blood and guts. The gore itself ranges from amateurish to outstanding, with the crusher being a nauseating affair. However, some of the gore scenes were just too long, especially the sword scene near the end. Do I really need to see Montag slowly pull the swords out, and untie them? The soundtrack was good enough, although a little oldtimey for me personally, the plot wasn't too bad (except a little slow), and the ending was completely confusing, and made the rest of the movie make very little sense.Even with all of the negativity, I'll still give this a reasonably high score. Why? Because this is supposed to be cheap trashy entertainment, and it is.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extreme gore from horror's Godfather</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Herschell Gordon Lewis was his own genre, so it's pointless to compare any of his work to anybody else's. It's even pointless to measure his movies against prevailing or once-prevailing standards. "The Wizard of Gore", which is half stage play in the grand guignol tradition and half melodrama, is very gory and very protracted. The bloodshed is amped up to just below that of "The Gore Gore Girls" and it's wonderful to behold, even if it still looks unconvincing. A woman gets her stomach ripped out, a spike is driven into another woman's head, and a mad magician, played with over-the-top glee by Ray Sager, gets to run his fingers through lots of female guts. A precursor to "Bloodsucking Freaks" and certainly the goriest film ever made at the time (1970). As is usual for Lewis's films, the acting is hammy, the sound recording is poor, and the cinematography is merely adequate. Nevertheless, we horror fans owe a great, scarlet debt to the Godfather of Gore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>H.G. Lewis does it again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After enduring the overrated "2000 Maniacs" and instant classic "Gruesome Twosome", H.G. Lewis has once again won my heart with "Wizard of Gore", his second-to-last horror film. A lot of the murders are superbly gory (spike driven into a head, a punch press disintegrating a woman's stomach, forced sword swallowing, cutting a woman in half) and have improved considerably since 1966. Yet there is still a level of camp that hasn't aged as well as Lewis' earlier efforts. Montag the magician's little speeches get old really fast and the overacting on his part is unbearable. The heroine is way too obnoxious and unlikable, likewise with her skeptical boyfriend. There is a lack of so-bad-it's-good acting and campy humor that works so well hand-in-hand with the gore effects in Lewis' earlier pictures. But if you're searching for a H.G. Lewis film, you're obviously looking for gore effects. And you'll get them here. Just don't expect this one to grow on you like "Gruesome Twosome", "She-Devils On Wheels", or "Blood Feast". Watch for the surprise ending, which makes some kind of perverse sense if you spend time thinking about it. Totally unexpected and original, considering it's coming from the Wizard of Gore!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a HUGE fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis and I have to say that this film, along with "2000 Maniacs" and "She Devils on Wheels" is one of my favorites. I'd also like to say a few words to those who have criticized the effects in Mr. Lewis' films. Herschell Gordon Lewis is the FIRST director to bring us in your face blood and guts such as those effects in this film and therefore he had no pre-set standards to go by, in fact he set the standards (as low as they may have been) for many of the genre films today. Many of the horror films of today use god-awful CGI effects most of which are MUCH more fake in appearance than anything I have ever seen in one of Herschell Gordon Lewis' films. If it weren't for films like "The Wizard of Gore" there would be no Freddy Kruger, no Jason Voorhees, no Leatherface and no Michael Myers. On a side note, this film is also notorious as being the first horror film to have a chainsaw murder in it (years before "Last House on the Left or "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre). A re-make of this classic (starring Crispin Glover in the title role)is currently in post-production stages and it is being reported that the very same company that is producing this re-make is also producing a re-make of "She Devils on Wheels". There is also an idea being pitched that would cast many of Mr. Lewis's most (in)famous villains including Montag the Magnificent from "The Wizard of Gore" in lead roles. Watch for Mr. Lewis next film "Herschell Gordon Lewis' Grim Fairie Tales" which puts the eighty-something year-old director back in the director's chair, where he belongs!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a real fun one. "The Wizard of Gore" is another movie from the awesome Hershell Gordan Lewis and is filled with ridiculous gore, bad acting, and a storyline so out there you have to wonder what was going on in his head at the time.Ray Sager plays Montag the Magnificent a magician who does more then just pull the old rabbit out of the hat. No, Montag likes performing tricks that involve sawing women in half with a chainsaw, or ramming a metal spike through a woman's head, I think you get the idea. The magic part comes in when he is able to murder these women without the audience knowing. To the audience, it is nothing more then a trick. To us, the viewer, we see the goriness of what is really happening. Apparently, the women being murdered don't even realize they are dead until long after the performance is over when they just drop dead in public places. Will the police figure out what is going on and who is committing these horrible crimes?Ray Sager's performance as Montag is a lot of fun as most of his performance is him yelling and boasting. Obviously Montag has quite an ego. The gore effects are what you can expect from any HG Lewis film, cheesy but extremely gory and bloody, nevertheless. The acting is truly hilarious and is just awful, but this all works to the movies charm and the style. Let's face it, this is no award winning film here.I heard that a remake is in it's post production. I am not sure what to make of this as most remakes just suck. But on rare occasions we get a decent remake.Anyway, "The Wizard of Gore" is a great gore film and should not be missed. 8/10</fullReview>

I would have passed on writing any more reviews of them until I and a few friends spent (and I mean "spent" in the sense of "exhausted", "used up", "wasted") an evening watching "The Wizard of Gore". Naturally, I had seen it before, but my attention was always focused on the extremely inept (yet still revolting) gore effects. Then, one of my friends watching pointed out just how dull the bits in between the gore scene were. Quite true. Even the lead-ins to the supposed shock scenes crept along at a snail's pace, completely dissipating any tension there might have been. It is almost impossible for anyone to pay attention to this film because for most of the film, nothing happens. Then, when the gore scenes come, you haven't been engaged by the film in any way. You really just don't care about what happens next. The Lewis cult people should give it up. Lewis is incompetent as a director and his movies are not innovative - just dull, repulsive little cinematic abortions.</fullReview>

The women magically recover but are later found dead bearing the same wounds as they did during the act. Magic, hypnotism, or copy-cat serial killer? The plot, such as it is, is simply a set up for gore-auteur Herschell Gordon Lewis to stage graphic splatter scenes using animal cadavers for the close-ups. The scenes where Montag rummages around entrails as though he's looking for pearls are more silly than shocking. Some of the sword swallowing scenes are cleverly done, but beyond that, this film doesn't have much to offer beyond a check mark in gore-fans' life lists.

		<fullReview>"The Wizard of Gore," one of splatter pioneer Herschell Gordon Lewis's later films, follows a local TV reporter and her boyfriend who become fascinated by a local magician, Montag the Magnificent, who horrifically mutilates women onstage; the magic is that his subjects inexplicably survive their ordeals, restored and unfettered. But when the women begin dying offstage, things get even weirder.Herschell Gordon Lewis is an acquired taste?his films have the late '60s aesthetic of a "Brady Bunch" episode, except they are excessively and elaborately gory. They are classic B-movies of a bygone era, one that is impossible to be recapture, and that is why fans still flock around films like "The Wizard of Gore" or "Two-Thousand Maniacs"?they are relics of the genre."The Wizard of Gore" has been touted as one of Lewis's most bizarre offerings, and it's understandable why people have said so. While there is a plot strung between the moments of grand guignol of blood spillage (rooted in hypnosis and journalism), what really is on display here is the elaborate, gross-out special effects. This in and of itself makes the film a bizarre viewing experience, as an audience mediated through an audience?the characters look on at the victims, and we look on at the victims while looking on through the characters. It's a strange dynamic, and the film plays with our tendencies toward fascination when it comes to freakshows, and moreover, violence.The effects themselves? They're at times disgusting, at others bizarrely edited, but the truth about them after all these years is that, in spite of their being aged in some respects, they're still visceral. It's hard not to wince as a woman is impaled by a steel pipe, and then is playfully eviscerated on a wooden slab in front of spectators. It is these gross-out moments that punctuate the film, and are what give it its singlehanded punch.Overall, "The Wizard of Gore" is a gory, macabre effort, and one of Lewis's more memorable films; it's also one of his most surreal. Some will dismiss it as cheap exploitation, which is fair, but it's also worth taking into consideration the film's phantasmagorical thematics and the ways it presents explicit violence to its audience. What are we watching? And why do we watch? 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Montag the Magnificent (Ray Sager) is just that: Magnificent. Right in front of his audience's eyes, Montag chainsaws, spikes, decapitates, and performs a whole array of other mutilating acts. But, with a wave of his hands and a bit of hypnotism, he repairs them with a snap. Unfortunately for his 'willing volunteers,' as soon as their hypnotism lifts, they literally fall apart at the seams. Now, it's up to a talk-show host (Judy Cler) and her fiancé (Wayne Ratay) to uncover the mysteries that lie beneath the illusionist surface of Montag the Magnificent.Obviously this is not the perfect film. . . like many of the splatterfests/gore features of the 60s &amp; 70s, it's a very low-budget affair ($60,000 in 1970 would be less than $350,000 today) that is quite apparently more concerned with shock &amp; gore than, you know, great writing, direction, and sound quality. But, that's what you're supposed to expect when you watch a film like this. Therefore, it's better to judge it as a splatter film rather than some type of masterpiece of film-making. And, as a splatter film, it's solid gold: one of the best I've ever seen. Montag is a fascinating subject and his work is extremely shocking. The story works well from the 'hypnotism' and 'double deaths' for Montag's victims to the 'heroes' who must investigate him. . . it all worked. While the sound &amp; video quality were obviously not superb, a better DVD with more care for remastering could solve that. The acting wasn't unbearable, especially for a grindhouse splatter film. But, what's most important: The gore. While it was obviously not believable in some parts (parts where it probably wasn't supposed to be (like Montag's decapitation at the very beginning)), it was still utterly grotesque and real enough for me. Fans of HGL and similar splatter-makers will not be disappointed in this one.Like many splatter films, I'm having a hard time rating this. . . I could give it anywhere between a 6/10 (as a film in general) or a 9/10 (as a splatter flick). . . so, I'll just cut it down the middle for a:Final verdict: 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just checked out YouTube and found out that one of the sites there I subscribed to had put this Herschell Gordon Lewis flick on there today (or yesterday since it's now a few hours the next day). This is the first time I've seen one of this guy's movies in its entirety. While I did find the gore a little shocking, it was also very obvious how theatrically creative (in other words, a little fake) many of those scenes were. One of those scenes, by the way, I recognized in the movie Juno when that character and the one played by Jason Bateman were watching it on TV. While I recognized how amateurish the acting was, I did like the campy performance of one Ray Sager as the notorious Montag the Magnificent. Many of his line readings made me laugh so much! The leading lady as a TV personality and the leading man as a sportscaster actually weren't bad either. Despite some of the acting, the story was pretty good until the end, when, well, whatever logic you expected was very much thrown out the window and you're left saying huh? With all that said, I was pretty entertained by The Wizard of Gore. I guess now, I've gotta find another HGL flick to satisfy my curiosity. Maybe another one will be posted on YouTube or Google Video soon...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite Possibly Lewis' Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Herschell Gordon Lewis' masterpiece (with possible competition from "Blood Feast") "The Wizard of Gore", we peer into the world of Montag the Magnificent (Ray Sager). Montag has incredibly powers, being able to convince his audience that they are watching actual scenes of brutal torture. But after the show ends, the artificial victims become all too real. Will a reporter and a talk show host get to the bottom of these nasty murders? Those who love blood and guts (and that Is me!) are going to savor every last drop of this splatter fiesta. Spikes impaled in the brain, chainsaws across the stomach... eyes gouged out... swords in the throat. A drill press! There is a 60s or 70s feel to this (as there should be, given when it was made), so if you do not like camp or kitsch, you might think something is amiss. Lewis has used some odd footage. The audience always seems out of sync with what is going on on-stage, for example. And the focus here is clearly gore and not plot. Not only is the plot incredibly thin, but we are never really explained what is going on behind the scenes. Are the victims killed? If so, how do they walk away? Are they illusions? If so, how do they die later? The answer really is not that important.Ray Sager, who plays Montag, is excellent, and it is a surprise to see he was a last minute addition (though the melodramatic delivery of lines may be because of this). A frequent collaborator with Lewis, I do not know if a better actor could have been chosen. In the remake, Crispin Glover fills this role, and Glover is quite the strange one. But there is only one Sager and it is great that we have him here.We also have Lewis using the odd shot of focusing on the eyes of Montag (a similar shot is used in "Blood Feast" for Fuad Ramses). It is a cheap and easy gimmick, but works to set a creepy mood effectively.Side thought: In "Juno", two of the main characters debate Herschell Gordon Lewis versus Dario Argento while watching "Wizard of Gore". Let me weigh in: Argento is the better director, by far. However, there is something in Lewis' work that cannot be denied, and even the great Agento owes him a debt for cracking open the door to let out the new genre of splatter horror.I have seen the film twice now, but am still not sure if I can write an adequate review. But for now, I have to stress how fast a strong impression was left on me. Films like this just do not come by often. Joe Lynch, bless his heart, made a good gore film with "Wrong Turn 2", but there's something about this time period that cannot be duplicated today. "Wizard of Gore" is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, I think this is a brilliant film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*PARTIAL SPOILERS* Deliberately brilliant? No. Flawed? Good god, yes; the acting and production values are terrible. But somehow, "The Wizard of Gore" works. The creepy, menacing atmosphere (which has nothing to do with the gore sequences) was largely accidental, perhaps...but not entirely, as the dreamy soundtrack composed by Larry Wellington seems to indicate. The Godfather of Gore, always in it for the money, thinks that this was his worst effort. He's wrong! Herschell Gordon Lewis made a lot of entertaining drive-in flicks, but none of them were even remotely like "Wizard". It works as a straight horror film, even if that wasn't Lewis's intention. Never mind the fact that Judy Cler and Wayne Ratay are two of the worst leads in cinematic history; concentrate on Ray Sager's deadly serious performance as Montag the Magician. What he lacks in acting ability, he makes up for in sheer enthusiasm and drive. If you like surreal psychological horror á la "The Twilight Zone" and "Carnival of Souls", you'll like this, too (though I won't argue for a minute that "Wizard" isn't *way* rougher around the edges than "TZ" or "Carnival"). Why do all the women who volunteer for Montag's tricks turn up dead? What's really happening, and why can't the good guys get to the bottom of it? All the odd little quirks of the film--the stigmata, Montag's unexplained visits to the morgue to nab the bodies of the women who have been killed, and even the hiss of the cheap microphones during the movie's uncomfortably quiet moments--just add to its atmosphere. Be forewarned: most of the gore is cartoony and unconvincing, but there is one stomach-churning scene in which Montag performs a sword-swallowing trick on two bound "volunteers".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true exploitation zeitgeist!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now here's a bizarre movie! Is this a horror movie? Well, not really. There's a fine line here, I know, but this movie is more in the way of sheer exploitation. The plot is so thin you can barely follow it, however, with a good imagination, you should be able to fill in the gaps.The reason I say that that this is not a horror movie is that it's mainly concerned with torture scenes. To me, that qualifies as exploitation. I don't have problem with that. If you do, then stay as far away from this one as you can! WOG is one of the most mean-spirited films you're likely to run across, and a love of the bizarre is a must to fully enjoy it. It's hardcore!As hardcore as this movie is, it still isn't great. See it if you love trash cinema stuff like I do. It'll also be a good one to show to your friends so that you can see the look on their faces.Long live Montag! Long live exploitation! Viva H.G. Lewis!6 out of 10</fullReview>

I didn't get to see it then, but I just got it through a certain mail-order DVD club. This movie is hilarious! Everything about this movie is BAD, but in a GOOD way! The speeches Montag the Magnificent gives his audience about "being in a dream, but thinking you're awake and then waking up, but PERHAPS you just begin to dream instead!!!" WHOA!!! Montag's into some heavy sh@#!!! This movie really made me think! If you've seen Blood Feast and liked it, see this movie next. If you've seen this and haven't seen Blood Feast, then see that.

		<shortDescription>Hands down, the most underappreciated film ever!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is all too unfair and unfortunate that some viewers try to compare a singularly unique piece of DIY cinematic art such as Wizard of Gore by today's Hollywood standards. One needs to merely take the relatively low production values at face value to see that Herschell Gordon Lewis's magnum opus displays pure, fundamental genius and logic on a multitude of levels. The sheer sickness of some of the gore scenes has turned the stomachs of many whom I've shown this film to even today, despite how obviously they were executed for the camera. I personally find the often inept acting entertaining, but again, it is unfair to judge this (or any of Hersch's) films by the caliber of thespianism; the cast did not just finish a run at the Steppenwolf; many were just ordinary folk recruited for the exciting opportunity to appear in a feature film. But it is Lewis's sheer ingenuity that tops this underappreciated classic. Cutting budget corners by filming on-locations around Chicago such as local TV stations, restaurants, and a grade-school auditorium (where Montag's gory stage act takes place!!!) produce a documentarian time-capsule that Hollywood couldn't come close to replicating with a $30,000,000 budget. In addition to directing Wizard of Gore, Herschell also basically wrote the script which recieves almost universal acclaim even from the film's harshest critics. Oh, and did I mention the rather sophisticated freak-jazz soundtrack, also by Herschell. Bottom line: if your uppity, narrow-minded, and only amused by Hollywood flash, don't bother seeing this movie. If you can appreciate do-it-yourself cinematic craft at its finest, SEE THIS MOVIE NOW!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So-so splatter flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So the basic premise is a stage illusionist gets girls on stage and basically mangles them, but hey presto there OK at the end. But then they die shortly afterwards with the same wounds that they got during the act. That's about it, oh and there's a 'twist' at the end. I cannot help but compare HGL with Ed Wood. The similarities are all too obvious for all to see. Question is are they trying to be badly made or are they just badly made? I've no idea but I get the feeling HGL knew what he was doing, and through that I feel cheated. It wouldn't have hurt to put a bit more effort in. The gore is there naturally (in fact the title probably refers to HGL rather than the illusionist), but most of it could be created in your own kitchen. There's a whole 'what is reality' thing going on which is never properly addressed, which it should have been if that was his point. I've seen an interview with HGL in which he came across very well, but I think it's more the case of him talking a good movie rather than delivering one. I love low budget movies but this one has no style and the narrative jars at every corner. Will I try another HGL movie? Yeah probably, I'm a sucker for pap and maybe one day I'll get it. A mildly diverting oddity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definitive "cheesy" horror film , featuring one of the most memorable goofs ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike some members of IMDb, I don't reward craptastic movie making with high scores, even if the craptastic film in question turns out to be a masterpiece of pop kitsch. Which is the case here. So Wizard of Gore only gets three stars, mostly for the stomach-churning stage sequences wherein the putative 'Wizard' disembowels, maims and punch-presses his victims to death in front of a live audience, only it's OK because it's all an 'illusion', only it's NOT really OK because the victims all die horribly soon after. It's a compelling concept - murdering women in full view of an audience and getting away with it because the REAL illusion is that they weren't harmed - but it's literally the only thing the movie has going for it. Everything else about the movie is grade Z - from the stiffs who are trying to act to the 3rd grade metaphysics in the scripting to the technical sloppiness and low budget of the sets, costumes, and lighting. In fact, this movie contains the single most memorable 'goof' I've ever seen in a movie: Montag is trying to put a subject (and the audience) into a trance, and he's looking into the camera doing his 'you are getting sleepy' spiel, and he's going along, and then he says (and I am NOT making this up):"Concentrate.....*c-croncentrate* with every bit of your being....!""Croncentrate"?!?! Shouldn't the director have done a second take? (Or worse, he did several takes and this is the one they KEPT?!?). Or shouldn't someone have caught this in post production and dubbed a correction? (Of course, I am assuming the movie was actually "produced" which clearly was not the case.) Apparently no one (including Lewis) was actually paying attention while the camera was rolling. Or after wards. Geez, even "The Astounding She Monster" had better production values than that, and ASM only cost $11.98 to make. I don't want to beat on Lewis too severely (although he WAS partially responsible for "Monster A Go-Go" as well). "2000 Maniacs" was much better than this (at least for the first half), and his "Blood" trilogy was somewhat better. I'd suggest someone who wants to investigate HG Lewis would be better off starting with those films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wizard, from the Godfather</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of this movie alone is a good enough reason to see it; the fact that it features buckets of the Godfather of Gore's trademark red stuff is another one! It has to be said that this isn't a good movie by any stretch of the imagination, but there's plenty of fun to be had with it, and anyone who digs HG Lewis is bound to enjoy themselves. The plot is more than obviously an excuse for HG to get his bucket of red paint out, as the simple plot follows an illusionist who makes his audience believe that he's brutally murdering young women from the audience as a part of his act. The scenes on the stage make up most of the film, and Lewis delights in showing us every speck of blood from the horrific sequences. Seriously, this guy earned himself the nickname 'The Godfather of Gore' for a reason! Anyway, the plot thickens (just a little) when the girls he 'murders' on stage begin turning up dead in the same fashion as his illusions - a TV presenter and her boyfriend soon get on the case, but as the bodies start to pile up...the show is allowed to go on, just so HG can think up even more gore scenes! The effects are really quite silly, and look like they cost the director little more than a few pence. However, you do get the impression that HG Lewis really put his heart into this film, and that makes up for the crappy effects...even if they do make you laugh more often than they make you cringe. I'm sure that Lewis would have loved to have Vincent Price star in this film, but he had to make do with regular collaborator, Ray Sager instead. Sager's role is silly anyway, but his performance makes it even more camp than it should be. The rest of the acting is terrible as well; but, to be honest, I wouldn't have it any other way. The plot revolves entirely around the stage show, which takes place in a tiny, dingy, little arena with about ten seats in it. Really, the film just hops from one gore scene to another; and Lewis doesn't seem to know what to do with himself when there aren't any guts on the screen, as the 'filler' scenes are really quite boring. It all boils down to a really stupid finale...but it's one that makes it obvious that HG Lewis made this film a smile on his face, and I've got to say that I really enjoyed it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Wizard of Gore" is not a movie.It's a piece of tool designed to insult a horror fan's intelligence.For me to describe this film is like describing what human fecal matter would look like after being thrown against a wall.A big mess of a movie,this film gets only one star because it had that midnight drive-in theater appeal going right along with it.I remember the days of going to those drive-ins and watching those gory blood and guts movies that had an effect on me 'til this very day.The difference between those films and "The Wizard of Gore" is that those films,even though they were silly,had a sense of unease because of the gore.They seemed real.As for "The Wizard of Gore",it was not even shocking.It was way too fake looking.I know this was back in the early 1970s and the technology for blood and gore effects weren't all that good.But,I have seen films(although,I can't remember which)also released in that time that seemed more realistic in terms of gore.I will admit that the gore in this film can be a little stomach churning.It's just the idea that I was expecting a better reaction from this film.Herschell Gordon Lewis is basically the kind of filmmaker that reminds me of one of those cult filmmakers like John Waters."The Wizard of Gore" is a cult classic to the fans who watch his films.I don't get all excited whenever his films come to DVD or VHS because there is no point in doing that.When I was eight,I have seen a lot of gory blood splattered films.Even though now they are considered to me as senseless,they had that "Ooh,wow.Look at that!".Or,it would have me cringing a bit because of the gore."The Wizard of Gore" made me want to laugh.I was uncovinced because the gore was uncovincing.Watching "The Wizard of Gore" is so bad,it makes me want to beat my head in for watching this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wizard of Gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Herschell Gordon Lewis' blood and guts opus concerns a master magician whose stage acts really feature the violent deaths of his assistants from the audience. Montag the Magnificent(Ray Sager, in a campy performance)uses hypnotism to blanket his audience's perception of what is really going on while performing his acts on stage. What the audience sees is different from what Montag actually does to those who are, in actuality, unwilling participants, put under his spell, destroyed in gruesome fashion. Whether it be a chainsaw act that splits a girl in half, a punch press which burrows a hole into the stomach of another victim, a spike to the skull through the left ear lobe, or sword swallowing resulting in tongues and teeth removed, Montag is able to trick his paying customers into believing it's all an act, even after those harmed walk off the stage seemingly okay, later discovered to be anything but. Sports columnist Jack(Wayne Ratay)and television personality Sherry(Judy Cler)feel like there's more to Montag's acts that meets the eye. Those "marked for death" have a sign of blood on their hands, perhaps an ominous warning of what could possibly come for them in the future.While I don't necessarily consider HGL's THE WIZARD OF GORE to be a good movie in the least, I do believe it's essential viewing for gore aficionados(the punch press and chainsaw murder scenes are epic in regards to bloody carnage). You get plenty of Montag fondling guts, organs, and innards as his victims squirm and scream while being disemboweled and torn apart. The spike to the skull is probably the worst gore sequence of the lot because of the editing miscues and fake mannequin head(which isn't very convincing). If anything, it's good for some laughs. The pacing to me was a major turn-off, particularly as Montag went on and on, setting up his murder acts by talking endlessly on his "art of illusion". The finale is rather funny where Montag attempts to hypnotize all the viewers of Sherry's television show with Jack coming to his fiancé's rescue. Sager fits the mold perfectly established in the grand tradition of HGL's gore classicks, a deranged, bug-eyed crazy lunatic who delights in torturing and maiming his victims. THE WIZARD OF GORE will be most suitable for HGL's devoted followers, who are tolerant of the lingering camera shots of damaged bodies and the non-actors often cast in only films directed by the celebrated independent shock schlock exploitation extraordinaire.</fullReview>

Then for no apparent reason, he steals the bodies and takes them to a mausoleum in the same cemetery...A group of reporters and cops attempt to solve the apparent mystery. Or maybe it's all a dream... In all probability, it is an opportunity to put gross special effects on the screen when the Hayes board went away and the MPAA was still trying to figure itself out.Of course, the special effects are so poor that they are laughable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third H.G. Lewis movie I've seen is the splatter on the cake. I'm a big fan of "Blood Feast", "2000 Maniacs", and "The Wizard Of Gore", and, watching them in their chronological order, the discerning splatter freak might notice that, with each one, Lewis was becoming better and better at what he was doing. Of course, "The Wizard" is still schlocky with some of the cheapest gore and fakest body parts you're likely to see, but there's an elevated sense of "it is what it is" and this movie is like a gruesome sideshow at some demented carnival, with even the flaws amping up its charm to practically amiable levels. Also, Montag (portrayed with a sense of unhinged, sinister fun by the freakin' awesome Ray Sager) is one of my favorite splatter villains, period. His rambling monologue about what we perceive as real or unreal is not only priceless hamminess that I would put right next to some of Vincent Price's best moments, but it's something I actually truly relate to as well. He is your not-so-humble huckster guide through this tour of depravity he revels in, until the end when things get so bizarre, out of control, and insane that even he is at the mercy of the cosmic (and comic) existentialism he espouses with sadistic glee. While the FX are typically not close to top notch, this movie has so much quirky heart and black soul that I cannot help but rate this as one of the truly greatest films of all time, and it comes with my absolute highest level of recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Messy, Interesting Gore Film....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I guess I should be commended on being able to sit through this entire film. Anyone that has should win a prize. It has poor acting, amateurish direction, cheap special effects, a ridiculous story, and an unbelievable quantity of blood and guts to make anyone miss their next pasta meal. Yet, through all of these shortcomings, I was for the most part entertained. The reason: the film is so poorly done and so unbelievable that one can only laugh at its being. The story is about a magician named Montag that commits atrocious dissections in front of his audiences and passes them for illusions, only later they really happen to the victims. One woman is sawed in half, a couple of girls swallow swords the hard way, one gal has a nail hammered into her head, and you get the picture. None of these grisly killings is very realistic and I attribute that fact to my ability to sit through this film. My only question is why would someone make such a waste of celluloid. However, if you like to see grisly crimes enacted lacking realism than The Wizard of Gore is for you....or if you, like myself, just like to laugh at a real, bad attempt at making a film, The Wizard of Gore is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another infamous inept gore classic from auteur Herschell Gordon Lewis.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wizard of Gore starts as stage magician Montag the Magnificent (asisstant editor Ray Sagar) prepares to wow a captive audience (that counts anyone watching at home out then...), he ask's for &amp; gets a female (Karin Alexana) volunteer from the audience. Montag the Magnificent claims he will saw her in half before the audience's eyes, however he won't be using a handsaw or a wooden box to obscure the trick. No, Montag the Magnificent shackles the woman down on an ordinary table &amp; then proceeds to cut her in half with a chainsaw. From the audience's point of view nothing happens &amp; the woman gets up seemingly unharmed, unfortunately later that night while at a restaurant the woman makes a mess on the floor when she drops down dead having mysteriously been sliced in half. Daytime TV talk-show host Sherry Carson (Judy Cler) &amp; her newspaper reporter boyfriend Jack Ward (Wayne Ratay) are the first to discover a link between Montag's performance &amp; the woman's death so begin an investigation to find out whats going on, oh &amp; Sherry wants Montag on her TV show....Produced &amp; directed by the so-called Godfather of Gore Herschell Gordon Lewis this was one of his later efforts but The Wizard of Gore is still as inept, badly made, amateurish &amp; silly as most of his other gore flicks. The script by Allen Kahn runs true to form for a Gordon Lewis flick &amp; is nothing more than an excuse to show girls being brutally killed in over-the-top gory ways so in that respect don't expect anything deep or meaningful (as if!). Unfortunately the padding, erm sorry I mean story between the killings isn't very good, in fact the term 'isn't very good' is a bit of an understatement. There are all sorts of strange, unnecessary, dull &amp; frankly weird scenes which the film could have done without. For instance meaningless scenes of Montag the Magnificent (I feel he's overselling himself a bit with the 'Magnificent' moniker) stealing bodies &amp; then placing them in a crypt for no apparent reason, the bumbling cops investigation, sherry &amp; Jacks character building scenes &amp; one of the most bizarre twist endings I have ever seen. I'm still trying to figure the ending out, no matter how many times I look at it it just never seems to make anymore sense! The undoubted highlight of The Wizard of Gore though is predictably the gore, it's not particularly realistic but Lewis dwells on it, has his camera zoom in on it, has Montag stick his hands into open wounds, fiddle about with people's insides &amp; pull them out &amp; there's plenty of fake blood splashed around. When all said &amp; done I quite liked The Wizard of Gore as it's certainly a bit different if nothing else, it's not art but good often bizarre very gory fun.Director Lewis really can't direct at all, The Wizard of Gore is so sloppily made, edited &amp; shot it looks like a high school production. I loved the opening scene where Montag takes the clichéd magic trick of sawing a woman in half &amp; twists it so Montag cuts a woman in half with a chainsaw in a sequence that's gorier than anything seen in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) which was made several years after this. There's also sword swallowing, a woman has a huge metal spike driven into her head before having her eyeballs popped out, someone gets her body squished with a power press &amp; Montag even cuts his own head off with a guillotine all with gory results. The special effects are poor, there's no other word to describe them really. There's no style, the sound quality is appalling &amp; the cinematography barely manages to capture what happening. The abrupt change in music to signal a shift between illusion &amp; reality is poorly handled &amp; the scenes showing a close-up of Montag's eyes every time someone is supposed to be hypnotised is rather jarring.With a supposed budget of about $65,000 this has horrible production values, poor special effects, some of the worst editing ever, grating music yet for some strange reason it sort of works. The acting sucks, on the DVD commentary Lewis reveals Sagar got the part of Montag because the guy they initially hired never turned up for filming!The Wizard of Gore isn't a film your supposed to like, from a production point of view it's an absolute disaster but I did like it, I liked the imagination on show, it's something different, I liked the basic premise &amp; I loved the over-the-top splatter filled gore effects. I can't recommend it wholeheartedly but I liked it on a personal level, basically if you have seen any of Lewis' other flicks &amp; liked them then you'll like this. Like his Two Thousand Maniacs! (1964) which was remade as 2001 Maniacs (2005) someone has also seen fit to remake this as The Wizard of Gore (2007) not that anybody wanted it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another "Oscar Winner" from Herschell Gordon Lewis.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We start with Montag the Magnificent speaking to an audience on the subject of illusions and reality. Unfortunately for him (and everyone else in this movie), reality shows his acting capabilities to be an illusion as well.The plot involves a magician who performs dangerous and life threatening "tricks" with female members of the audience. After the performances, the participants wind up being killed in the very manner of the previous illusion. The police start investigating the magician when they're tipped off by a TV reporter and her ever curious boyfriend (who are audience members recognizing the victims from the show).This is almost an intentionally bad film. I won't go into details as every single aspect of this movie screams of a cheap production. One graveyard scene was so bad that I thought Tor Johnson was waiting to be queued. And the audience members (what they show of them) all look as if they've escaped from an asylum for the aesthetically challenged (except for the victims, of course). There are some admittedly grisly scenes here and there. One woman is chainsawed in half, another has a spike pounded through her head (that he changes into a mannequin) and some others swallow swords that goes beyond the help of mere Maalox. Unfortunately, there's no sex to pad things here. Only insipid dialogue that makes one beg for the next dead body.I guess that it still fits into the category of being so bad it's good, so I'll go ahead and recommend it. Besides, it's Herschell Gordon Lewis and one has to have a foundation to build on with any genre (even exploit).Charlie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exploitation for the nerves?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like exploitation cinema. I like the cheesy violence and sex, the low quality scripts and no budget direction that comes with the genre. It's fun brainless carnage packed with oddities and quirks used by directors whom while trying to score a buck or two also test the censorship boundaries to their limit and sometimes succeed in making something that really stands out. With that cleared, H.G. Lewis's The Wizard of Gore is a forgettable piece of trash with a sort of interesting concept behind it. It's not about it being bellow the standard grindhouse experience, the splattery violence is indeed present here, no it's about the presentation, specifically about the lack of such.A magician performs tricks. Tricks never before seen, tricks of a gruesome violent nature. In the opening titles he cuts his head with a guillotine, shortly after reemerges fully intact. After a short introduction and a few minor tricks he chooses a volunteer from the audience, a woman, it's always a woman. Straps her on a bed and then proceeds to cut her in half with a chainsaw. All is done in clear view, and we see everything. He plays with her guts and innards and suddenly, just like that, she is whole again. Returns to her seat and shortly after the show is over dies the same way she was torn in two by the chainsaw.Lovely little idea for a horror and I must admit it was the reason why I chose to watch "The Wizard of Gore". The quality of the movie didn't matter much back then as I mentioned already, I like the low-grade cheesy stuff. But the surprise of just how bad that quality is came as complete shock to my senses. It was low, lower than that which I had found entertaining and even lower than that which I found dull. The only possible comparison I can think of is Michael Bay doing a no budget film. There is no dread for horror. There is no cheese for brainless carnage. There is only some of the worst gore effects, camera work, editing and audio captured on celluloid. It's an endless repetition of the same scene with just slight differences. The horrible gore gets even worse, looks laughable with each passing sequence. So absurd as to how Lewis wants you to believe a mannequin stuffed with red paint is a human body. With every minute it becomes more and more unbearable indeed this truly is a torture show. I'll restrain myself from commenting on the horribly annoying acting since that was never an issue worth noting in such type of film.The Wizard of Gore is an amateurish film showcasing horror as bad film-making and in a sense it truly is terrifying. Such a shame because a plot like this deserved something better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Lewis returns to his usual form.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a boring attempt to make a "real" movie, H.G. Lewis returns to making movies his own way (revolving around gory set pieces). He pours it on in this one. All the red paint and animal entrails you can stomach. This tale revolves around a magician who performs those tired parlor tricks (i.e. sawing a woman in half, sticking swords into a basket, etc.) but with some interesting conclusions. As with all of Mr, Lewis' films, the budget's poor, the acting is bad and the padded out feel is back. A return to form for Mr. Lewis in other words.Recommended for campy horror film fans.BP.S. The make-up man did a bad job of trying to make the magician look old and wizened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wizard of Gore, The (1970) * (out of 4) A news personality gets drawn to a magic show where Montag The Magnificent act out various forms of torture. The magician will make it appear that he is brutally slaughtering women on the stage but the women eventually walk off but hours later they are found really slaughtered. The newswoman's boyfriend starts to get suspicious so he starts to investigate. Clocking in at a torturous 96-minutes, this here is clearly the worst of Lewis' gore films. I normally enjoy all of his gore films but this one here was just torture to sit through and I found it deadly boring before the first murder had even taken place. Most of his gore films have very little plot but at least they have something in them. This film has absolutely nothing and it's no wonder this thing sat on a shelf for nearly two years before finally getting released. The first murder sequence is downright boring and sadly they don't get any better but in fact they continue to get worse. The explanation behind what the magician is doing and how he's doing it is just downright stupid and you can't help but roll your eyes throughout the film. Even worse are the gore effects, which have to be the worst of the director's career because of how fake they look. Countless times you see the women breathing even though they're suppose to be dead and there's one scene where the knife being used starts leaking blood before the actual murder. This movie is a complete disaster from start to finish and all the blame must go towards the director. Each scene is done is such a slow, drown out pace that I was just sitting there wondering what the heck Lewis was thinking by doing this. I'm certainly not trying to suggest that his other movies were masterpieces of cinema but at least they were entertaining. This one here just worthless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ahh . . . the power of cheese.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* Just to get this out of the way: Just because I give this a low score does NOT mean it isn't an enjoyable movie. It simply means it's inferior to other movies.1970s horror cinema seemed to be in conflict with itself. It's obvious that a lot of horror directors of the time wanted to make serious, mature, realistic, truly terrifying pieces? Straw Dogs, Alien, The Exorcist. It's also obvious that a lot of horror directors of the time wanted to make immature, cheesy, ridicules pieces?Suspiria, The Omen, The Wizard of Gore. It's almost impossible to believe the two polar opposites could come out of the same decade. But I guess every generation has filmmakers who grow up and those that don't. With all of that said, The Wizard of Gore is the only movie in the latter group that I can actually find pretty cool. It's no masterpiece. I'm not even sure it's even worth a watch, but if you do watch it, it's not that bad.The plot is very creative for a 70s movie, and that threw me off guard. I was planning on typing this section of the review ranting about how unoriginal the movie was, but I can't do that, for which I'm grateful. The first 20 minutes are an absolute blast. However, sadly, after that point the plot takes a predictable average-man-turned-detective turn strait into a pit of boredom. The scenes that were initially pretty cool just turned repetitious and even a little annoying as they replayed over and over again throughout the movie. By the end of the movie, you'll easily start to see that you've just watched a predictable episode of The Twilight Zone, complete with cheesy reversal-of-expectations ending. The acting is laughable, as you probably expected. It's really saddening how such a great premise received such terrible execution.Speaking of executions?how was the gore? Well, first and foremost, the gore effects are some of the worst I've ever personally seen in a 70s movie. People are replaced by obvious mannequins. The blood looks more like ultra-red clown paint than realistic plasma. Guts are represented by what appears to be red and black wads of paper and look about as much like real organs as jelly doughnuts do. The actually amount and intensity of the gore isn't even that special. This is an exploitation film, so, obviously there is going to be a decent amount, but it's nothing compared to today's standards whatsoever. The pretentious losers who call this the goriest movie of all time, or even one of them, really need to watch popular movies. Just because a movie is obscure like this one does not mean it's gory. Just because a movie is popular doesn't mean it's made by weak pansies. In this case, that generalization I just made proves true.But regardless of all that, this is still a decently fun movie. It isn't going to make you throw up, but it will make you laugh, and there's nothing wrong with that. If you're a hardcore horror fan that must see any and all horror films, this isn't going to be the worst you see. If you're just a casual viewer, there is no reason for you to even waste your time here. Go watch a Takashi Miike movie?like Gozu?and you'll get the same experience, but with a much better story and much better production value. If you want over-the-top gore in similar style, check out Brain Dead. There is just no reason to watch this movie unless you absolutely are forcing yourself to do so.Overall, The Wizard of Gore is fun, but not fun enough. It's gory, but not gory enough. The story is creative, but quickly falls into clichés. I give it credit for trying, and I'm glad I viewed it, but it's no classic. Then again, neither are most of the movies that are labeled such.1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>H.G. Lewis tried to top "Blood Feast" with this somewhat creative clunker about a magician who saws people in half-- literally. The goopy blood flows freely helping cover the dreadful performances and Lewis's usual incompetent direction. Only interesting as a curio from the era before "Friday the 13th."</fullReview>
