		<shortDescription>A Delightful Family Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is only one movie in history that I can name that my wife, my mother and my six-year-old daughter enjoyed equally. This is it.This is an astonishly effective and pleasant remake of a very good film. It's light, romantic, touching and downright funny. You cannot pour enough accolades on young Lindsay Lohan, who effortlessly plays both twins, and, if you listen closely, juggles four accents. (She changes her Brit accent when she plays her own American alter-ego pretending to be herself in England - if you saw the film, you know what I mean).Natasha Richardson and Dennis Quaid with that big, goofy, infectious smile, give the film its romance and maturity, without stepping on the fun-filled kid's plot. This is simple, easy-to-watch family entertainment.There is also a great editing and effects element. You never once notice a split screen or cheap over-the-shoulder shot when both of Lohan's characters are on-screen - its really quite astounding how seamless it is.My daughter, after seeing this in the theater, quickly proclaimed this her favourite movie ever. We own the video, and I have watched it with her at least a dozen times without growing tired.A perfect rental after a bad day, or when you want to have a family movie night. *** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that this is the best Walt Disney film that I have seen since The Last Flight Of Noah's Ark. It is a delight from start to finish and every bit as wonderful, perhaps even better then the originial. This ia a welcome return to the good old fashioned clean family films Disney used to make. The soundtrack is wonderful and Lindsey Lohan is a great little actress who plays the two parts very well (I love her British accent). Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson were terrific at playing Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara's old parts. A young actress named Elaine Hendrix is a great comic villianess. I detested her character and laughed my head off when those girls gave her just what she deserved. Some people might say that this plot is old and clichéd by the standards of today, but it still works. They should release this on a double bill with the original. I hope Disney keeps on making films like this, goes back to "the good old days" so to speak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wonderful remake of the 1961 Hayley Mills film. This film is much more realistic, with better acting. Lindsey Lohan is amazing as both Hallie and Annie--I really did think she was two people, she portrayed the two different charactars fantastically. All the different charactars in this movie are really funny as well, and there are no bad actors. The plot just zips by! I give this movie 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good natured fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those rare cases where a terrific movie is equaled by its remake. Hayley Mills carried the dual roles of twins learning of each other's existence and concocting a plot to reunite their divorced parents splendidly in the '60's version, and Lindsay Lohan showed wonderful comedic talent at an early age in this delightful remake.It's a Disney flick, so the comedy is family slapstick variety as you would expect. The evil stepmother-to-be is over-the-top evil (even called Cruella De Ville by one of the girls), and she's a character you love to hate. The obvious chemistry of the parents (Randy Quaid and Natasha Richardson) is great, and begs a question which is never answered to satisfaction, "Why did they split up in the first place?" Everything in the film symbolically shows that they were made for each other: even their respective maid and butler take a shine to each other.The fx and editing to stand Lohan's two characters together is magnificently done; it really looks like two actresses. No split screens, backs of heads of fake-looking "doubles" etc. to distract you from the movie. Lohan skillfully contrasts the American/British accents and mannerisms of the two girls; you know and believe which twin she is at any given moment.Well directed, well acted and fun. I'll even forgive the film makers for ripping off the stranded-in-the-lake scene from "Meatballs." The closing credit snapshots provide a sweet epilogue to tie up loose ends.Good family oriented comedy worth a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Disney Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>School holidays can be deadly for older cinema patrons but sometimes there are films for children that are well worth a visit for adults. Unusually, The Parent Trap is a children's film that can even be recommended for children by the most morally bound parent - although there is a divorce that may need to be explained away. The Parent Trap is cute, sugary and funny - and unashamedly so. The Parent Trap was originally made in 1961 starring Haley Mills as a pair of twins who accidentally meet when they are eleven years old. Their parents divorced when they were babies. They then connive to get their parents back together. This is classic Disney material and the formula can and does work very well indeed in this modern version. Heaven only knows how the special effects are done but I suggest that you just forget about that and settle back and enjoy the film. You won't have any choice anyway. I was convinced that the twins must have been played by real life twins and I'm sure that I won't be the only one to fall for that particular Parent Trap. Young Lindsay Lohan plays the girls, (both of them!) complete with fabulous accents, sunny bright and distinctive personalities, appealing red hair, freckles and a great sense of fun. One of the girls has become a Londoner and one a Californian and the girls also sport very commendable English and American accents, as well as composites of the two accents when the girls switch places. It's also pleasing to see young girls being given the sorts of lightly rebellious antics to frolic with as are usually reserved for young boys. The story begins in a New England summer camp where practical jokes are the go, although the film is careful to keep nastiness well out of the way. It would be hard to accuse Lindsay Lohan's twins of any serious crime in any case. The girls decide to switch places so they can each meet their Mum and Dad. In true Hollywood style both parents are rich and attractive and they of course each have hired help (Lisa Anne Walter and Simon Kunz) who are of course are going to fall in love. But then we must have the wicked stepmother and this is provided by Meredith, a gold digger who's out to score the very rich hand of Dad. She's played with appropriate relish by Sharon Stone look alike Elaine Hendrix. The story really revolves around the parents, played by Natasha Richardson and Dennis Quaid. We can settle back and wait for the inevitable to happen, because we just know that this is going to be one of those "happily ever after" efforts where Mummy and Daddy will again fall in love and properly become parents for these two very cute and loving girls. But along the way be prepared for some very solid laughs and a wonderfully animated and motivated lizard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun reminiscence; see both versions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely worth seeing hand-in-hand with the original version; rent one on video and then go see the other in a theatre. The parallels are quite strong, though, as the world grows smaller, instead of a California/Boston split, it's a California/UK split.There are some lines of dialogue in common in both films that feel particularly appropriate, and are definitely winning ("like *sisters*" -- "No, [Halley], like *twins*"). The musical throwbacks to "Let's Gets Together" are also quite enjoyable.Perhaps recognizing that their target audience is not only kids the age of eleven-year-old Annie/Halley (Lindsay Lohan), but fans of Hayley Mills and the original film, a more in-depth rationale is presented for the breakup of the parents, with an appropriate romantic twist.Additionally, one never ceases to be amazed that some of the old tricks (and quite a few new ones!) work quite well. And, as the trailer says with a twinkle "Introducing...Lindsay Lohan" -- she's a knockout at this.Apparently Disney wanted to give Hayley Mills a bit part in this film but she was unavailalble...nevertheless, it's a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may look "a film for kids", but this movie really is, a must-see for both adults and kids. It is a great love story. I'm single but the film reached my heart - I'm sure married couples will love this film too.When I saw this for the first time, I was on airplane. I was lucky enough to get upgraded that time, so I was with personal video screen - I saw _The parent trap_ twice and cried several time in each of the viewing. Now I got DVD for it, I saw it more than dozen times by now. I feel very happy after every viewing of the film.Lindsay Lohan did it super (especially accents), dad and mom are really lovely.If the film comes to a theater near you, don't miss it. On big screen you can find some additional details DVD/Video. The film is totally, and completely lovely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beleive you me was i skeptical of this movie. First of all the original is a highly regarded film in my house. If it's on t.v the world stops for it. And beleive me when I first heard about the remake i was very very angry because hardly ever does a remake even compare to the original. I didn't understand it of course. Especially how a movie like that cold work in the 90's. I mean reality check what court, let alone parents, in the world would decide to split up a pair of twins let each parent have one never let them even know about the other one and never let them see each one ever again? Puh-Leeze. But boy was I ever wrong.This movie has every bit as much charm as the original and it's ending (I won't give it away) makes much more sence than the original, they-just-get-together-without-talking-any-of-there- problems-out original.And huge props to Lindsy Lohen on the accents. I am very big on accents and was overwhelmed at how good she was. I see big things for her.So go see it. It's truly captivating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Parent Trap " is good but its star Lindsay Lohan is better as she was able to steal my breath away in dual roles playing Hallie and Annie Parker. Working with such a clever plot, Lohan has almost single handily pulled off one of the best performances of 1998.Also, what a breath a fresh air to Hollywood as she explodes on the scene as one of the best child actresses I've seen in a long time. The proof is a movie called "The Parent Trap."Lohan's performance is great but we also must not forget that it stars Dennis Quaid as one of the best actors I've seen. With his versatile talent in film genres such as drama, action, or family, Quaid has the ability to capture my attention for the length of the movie."The Parent Trap" is a light hearted film that will allow the mind to flow freely while sitting and relaxing. In addition, the movie was not only clever, but original because Lohan pulled off her role as she knew what she was doing without having to be told what to do. Lohan is a natural talent that should be treasured because she is so good and seen in more filmsThe supporting cast also fit, which made it that much more enjoyable to watch. Good cast choices all the way around. I suggest that everyone see this film because it is really good clean fun with one of the brightest and youngest stars to hit Hollywood. Bravo to the cast and crew of "The Parent Trap."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say, I couldn't stand the original Parent Trap, but maybe that's because I saw this version first. Either way, the new Parent Trap is a great film and the perfect film to see with the family. When I saw it, I knew it would wind up in my family's library, and that it did, as soon it was available. Charming, funny, even romantic. I actually had a few tears at the end! The cast is great, Lindsey Lohan is funny and adorable, just likable, and unlike the original parents, Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson are excellent and seem like great parents. See it with any kids that you care about, everyone in every age category will like this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lohan Shines In Debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lindsay Lohan shines in her debut film: The Parent Trap, a remake, or more accurately, a re-imagining of the 1961 Hayley Mills' film. Lohan stars as the twin girls, who meet each other at summer camp, discover they're sisters living with divorced parents, and scheme to get their parents back together. This time one twin is from London and the other is from wine country in Napa Valley. Lindsay Lohan is full of charm and talent; she is every bit the equal of Hayley Mills in playing the twins. Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson, as the parents, are appealing as well; they have great screen chemistry as parents that never really fell out of love. The supporting roles of the domestics are filled well, and there are several in-joke film references to the first film. The problem with the film is that it is as predictable as it is formulaic, offering us nothing we haven't seen before. Elaine Hendrix, as the fiancé, is funny, but a bit over-the-top in Snidely Whiplash fashion at times. Joanna Barnes, who played this role in the 1961 film, returns as that character's mother this time. The film contains almost laughable turns of plot, which would hardly occur in real life, but it is a family-oriented film. Everything has to come out in the wash. It's interesting to note that the thematic elements concerning divorce do not really have the same negative connotations they most assuredly had in 1961. However, this is really an entertaining showcase for young Lindsay Lohan, a terrific find. This was also the directorial debut for writer Nancy Meyers, who is one to watch. **1/2 of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Changes Of Lindsay Lohan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that no one has recently commented on this Video for quite some time, maybe even years. My name is Zachary Fiducia, i'm 18 years old, from when i was about 5 years old till now occasionally ill watch this video knowing that for the longest time it was my favorite movie ever. It seems that even over the years this video is still number one in my records. One of the reason's why is because of Lindsay Lohans duel acting part. It was brilliant beyond no matter, her acting skills seemed flawless for the time. Along with Natasha Richardson who recently passed away unfortunately at such a young age and Dennis Quaid. What really got me was the selection of music for the film, it included "The Beatles, along with Nat King Cole" After watching this Film, i have to question myself what happened over the years? It seems that either movies are changing or people are changing. For example Lindsay Lohan, a once very talented actress and i say that with no regret, seems to be throwing away her talent here in 2009, and continuously over the years and its a shame. She once said that she wanted to "Become a director, continue acting and go to college" She might've tried to stick with that for a few years but it seems that she's given up? It hurts to watch this film knowing Natasha is gone (Rest in Peace) and that Lindsay is not this delightful young talented actor anymore. It's a shame i still give this film an 8 out of 10 because it proves that Lindsay does have talent, she always has she just doesn't know how to show it anymore. I thank the Directors for producing such a great family movie, it'll be my favorite for as long as i live.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sensational piece of family entertainment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walt Disney's 1998 remake of The Parent Trap is a sensational piece of family entertainment. This film marks the theatrical debut of the incredibly attractive Lindsay Lohan, who is now one of today's biggest stars. Lohan was a great choice for the dual role shown in this wonderful two-hour show. Lohan was beautiful even as a preteen (she was 11 years old when this movie was made). When I saw this movie for the first time, both of her characters, Hallie and Annie, really captivated me. Lohan really sparkles and does some adorable stuff throughout the entire motion picture. Both Hallie and Annie have a strong way with affection, and that is something that I deeply admire. I was touched when the two girls hugged each other in the camp's isolation cabin. Hugs are joyful and so is this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remakes are never as good as the original so I never bothered watching the 1998 version as I had seen the original in 1961 and it was a film that sticks in your memory. One night I could not find anything I wanted to watch on TV so was flipping through the channels and came across this version on Film4 (UK satellite TV). The film was half way through and I loved it. I found the film on the same channel a few weeks later but once again missed the first part. The same happened a 3rd time so I went through the channel listings for the next month until it was on again on 23rd Jan. I then recorded it on both my living room and bedroom SkyPlus boxes. Although a Disney comedy I find this version to be a real tear jerker. 10 times there are scenes that bring a lump to my throat and tears to my eyes. I have watching it least 50 times and still watch it at least twice a day. The cast are perfect with Lindsay Lohan stealing the show. The most beautifully emotional film I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovable Lindsay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so sweet it should have a warning label for diabetics. Natasha Richardson and Dennis Quaid play divorced parents who more than a decade later are not sure why they divorced. Instead of opting for joint custody, each of them opted for sole custody of one of their twin daughters. The girls grow up never knowing because their parents never said they had an identical twin sibling. When the twins meet in camp and discover who they are, the plot is set in motion.Richardson and Quaid are wonderful as the likable parents, still very much in love, even after a decade apart. But, the star of this picture and the one on whom the story turns is Lohan. She is bright, perky, adorable, and completely convincing as both Hallie and Annie. If she isn't, this movie falls apart fast. But, not to worry. Lovable Lindsay makes not a single false step.She is so good, I found myself thinking about the actress, not the character, feeling a twinge of sadness that Lindsay was not more like Hallie and Annie. This is a wonderful movie, almost too sweet at times. It had me in tears at all the right moments: when the twins meet, when they learn they are sisters, when the parents discover they've switched places, and when the parents inevitably reconcile. First rate family entertainment thanks to a star performance from a very young, very talented Lohan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first I was a bit freaked out because Lindsay Lohan wasn't Hayley Mills, but from the moment the twins discovered they were twins, I was hooked.I can't apply enough positive adjectives toward this movie. It was touching to see each one-on-one family reunion, as they just kept coming. It was funny and witty, and I laughed unexpectedly at several points. And it was romantic: although this isn't typically classified as a romantic comedy due to its family orientation, it's perhaps one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen, set up by the aforementioned reunions. It was even heartwarming, and a bit nostalgic, to see the child star, so vibrant and carefree, back before she, well, "matured" into a young adult and its associated questionable behavior. In all, this movie was perfectly cast, even down to the bad girl, and it far exceeded my expectations. Now I want to go back and watch the original again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lindsay Lohan, known for being an easy press target, used to be cute! This movie is a good example of her red-headed, freckled goodness! In this late 90's remake of a Hayley Mills classic, Lohan plays both homely Napa Vallley girl Hallie Parker and Prim and proper London native Annie James...who unexpectedly meet at summer camp and don't exactly take a fancy to each other. But, when both put in the isolation cabin due to their antics, they learn they are twins separated at birth. So, predictably...they swap places, meet their parents...but there is an ugly surprise: Hallie's dad is about to wed snooty newspaper reporter Meridith Blake...this could thwart their efforts to bring their parents back together...or will it? This was, overall, a very entertaining film. Lohan was adorable. The performances of Natasha Richardson and Dennis Quaid as the parents were also very memorable! I recommend this if you like the cute redhead version of Lohan...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will never not love Disney's The Parent Trap. It's pure escapist fun with a delightful setup that pays off big time with laughs, heart and and a classic story of mistaken identity. Lindsey Lohan, back when she still resembled a human being, is endlessly adorable as both sides of a set of twins, separated at birth, who meet serendipitously at summer camp. Hallie is a laid back California chick with attitude to spare, and Annie a buttoned down, introverted London gal. They cross paths, become the best of friends and each begin to yearn for the parent they never had. Soon they hatch a cunning plan to switch places on their parents in hopes of getting them back together. At the end of the summer Annie goes back to Napa Valley as Halley, and Halley to London, as Annie. That's when the fun really begins. Dennis Quaid displays his easygoing charm and mile wide smile as their father, a vineyard owner, and Natasha Richardson (RIP:() is heavenly as their radiant mother, a wedding dress designer. Veteran DOP Dean Cundey expertly sails through London archways and sweeping sun dappled valleys, creating a gorgeous playground for the actors to bring this excellent comedy, with surprisingly mature emotional beats, to life. The plot draws us in further as the girls attempt to sabotage Quaid's wedding to a horrible gold digging banshee (Elaine Hendrix, syrupy slime). It's all set to a lighthearted comforting rhythm, and looks fantastic on scree. I grew up with this one, and keep revisiting it again and again.</fullReview>

I don't normally shed a tear over even the most emotional films but this certainly brought a tear to my eye on more than one occasion, as well as making me laugh. This is surely one of Natasha Richardson's finest hours, with superb performances from Dennis Quaid and Simon Kunz as the brilliant butler. You also have to think that Lindsay Lohan was an arguably better actress as a teenager than an adult, performing two parts just as brilliantly as each other. Great entertainment for all the family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Their parents divorced when they were babies, Mum Elizabeth raising Annie in London and Dad Nick raising Hallie in California, and neither of the identical twin girls knew the other existed. They meet at summer camp and decide to switch places so that they can both get to know the missing parent they have always yearned for, with a view to reuniting them. Their plan becomes complicated because Nick is planning to marry golddigger Meredith.Walt Disney's 1998 remake of its earlier version has 11-year old Lindsey Lohan replacing Hayley Mills in the dual roles of Hallie and Annie. The rest of the cast, headed by Dennis Quaid as Nick and Natasha Richardson as Lizzie, are all excellent, but Lohan is superb. She creates two characters who are similar but different, and copes easily with four accents - English, American, English doing American and American doing English. The special effects which place her in the same scene with herself are superb: the split screen of the original version is enhanced with digital effects which are absolutely seamless.And the film - which doesn't bear close examination in terms of plot, though that really doesn't matter- is huge fun, performed with great good humour, and some emotional heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the Lohan Twins steal this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>before anyone tweets or twitters, yes, indeed, I know there is only one Lohan twin, but I maintain (and I saw the first version with Haley Mills in a theatre) that the reason this movie works, and works so well, is that she sells the two roles like Black Friday at Bloomingdales. Seriously, this movie is far better than it should have been because of her. And yes I know this opens yet another can of worms. Before Lindsay grew up to become Britney, and play Marilyn Monroe in a miniseries, and be awarded Sexiest Woman Alive by some sycophantic reality show, this was what she did best. Act. She was great in this, and she was great in DRAMA QUEEN and she was great in MEAN GIRLS. I wonder if film historians of the future will give her proper credit? She steals her scenes from everyone else in the film except the dog. Dennis Quaid looks especially uncomfortable just trying to keep up with her. Much better than the IMDb rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Parent Trap is a must-see for anyone, even adults! When this movie came out I was 9 years old - now I'm 23 and STILL love it. The jokes and plots hold up well, even 13 years later. I watched this movie the other day and cannot believe how much I still enjoy it.The soundtrack is amazing, as well. The decades-old songs work so well with this movie, which is a great surprise. The Parent Trap has one of the best soundtracks to a movie (okay I'll admit it... I own the CD and STILL listen to it in my car!)Do yourself a favor and see this movie if you haven't already. I've never met a person who didn't like this movie. Plus, it's endearing to see Lindsay Lohan as an innocent child (though sad comparing to what she turned out to be.)Bottom line: You won't be disappointed. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really enjoyable, newer version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this movie today on a 'double feature' with the original. And although I love the original, mainly because of the incomparable Haley Mills, this version is just as enjoyable and in some ways, more believable.First of all, it made me so sad to think of how Lindsay Lohan has gone down-hill. She really is a solid actress and anyone who has seen her in "Mean Girls" knows what I mean. And in this movie, her English accent and her American accent are solid and believable.The wonderful departed Natasha Richardson simply oozes class and sophistication, as well as a knack for comedy. Well, why not, with her gene pool and family background? And her interaction with the always solid Dennis Quaid is truly good and believable. You can actually imagine how they once fell in love and easily imagine that they'll reunite.The supporting characters are also terrific. Much better here, that it is not cluttered up with any parents and grandparent, as in the original. And the fiancée in this version is so much more believable than the one in the 'original'. In this version, you can almost like the woman and then feel sorry for her.I'm not much on "re-makes", but this one was worth doing and they did it so very well. Two thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lindsay Lohan gives an impressive performance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good movie. Lindsay Lohan's performance is impressive. She is a very talented actress and shows it in this movie. To play a dual role is a difficult but she does it and does it well. When watching Ms. Lohan in this movie it is hard to believe that she is the same person who is now the subject of so much negative attention. As for the rest of the cast, they are also excellent, especially the two who play the butler and the housekeeper. They were warm and funny. Of course, it's so sad what happened to Natasha Richardson. She was such a beautiful, charming, wonderful actress, as she proved in this movie. Although Dennis Quaid got top billing, the movie does not center around his character. Rather, Lindsay Lohan carries this movie; she is the actual star. She is in just about every scene, playing two different roles. One thing about Lindsay Lohan: she is talented. Maybe one day she will return to the screen and again become a star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Parent Trap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Nancy Meyers (What Women Want), this is actually quite fun and not too cutesy for a Disney film, especially a remake. Basically, at Summer Camp in Maine, USA, two redhead eleven-year-old girls, Hallie Parker and Annie James (introducing then freckly faced Lindsay Lohan, playing both) coincidently meet each other, and after a little naughtiness with each other, become friends, and after finding out more about each other, realise they are twin sisters. Hallie by the way is the cool, laid back California gal, living with father Nick (Dennis Quaid), and Annie is the proper rose from London, living with mother Elizabeth James (Natasha Richardson), and the girls, who never met their other parent decide to swap places to get their time together. Hallie seems pretty happy with her mother in London, but Annie discovers her father is planning to marry new "love", the nasty and money hungry "Cruella", Meredith Blake (Elaine Hendrix). So the twins now have the plan for Hallie to reveal herself to Elizabeth, so that they can travel to America and try and get her and Nick back together, after eleven years apart. They do eventually get Meredith out of the way after pulling some tricks on her, and they do get Nick and Elizabeth in a room together, and there is a happy ending after that moment of unsureness, so the whole family are reunited with a wedding. Also starring Bruce Almighty's Lisa Ann Walter as Chessy (Parker's Housekeeper), Four Weddings and a Funeral's Simon Kunz as Martin (James's Butler), Gremlins' Polly Holliday as Marva Kulp, Sr. and Friends' Janice, Maggie Wheeler as Marva Kulp, Jr. The special effect tricks are so good it is really easy to forget there aren't really two Lohans, yes, she is cute and likable as both twins, I'll admit this is more for little girls, but I have to say, all the family should watch. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this film isn't exactly a romantic comedy, there are some scenes of intense romance on it, so I've chosen this day in particular to write a comment about it: 14th February (Valentine's Day).This movie tries to be charming and "cute", but this try isn't completely successful.The sequence aboard the gorgeous liner Queen Elizabeth II is very romantic and gives a nostalgic and classic touch to the movie. To accent this romantic atmosphere, during the opening sequence aboard the QE II we hear the beautiful song "L.O.V.E." by Nat King Cole. There's also a sequence (later in the movie) aboard a luxurious yacht, recreating the night aboard the QE II. Both sequences are brilliant.Nat King Cole's song isn't the only good oldie here. There are more, like "There She Goes" by The LA's and Natalie Cole's "This will be (an everlasting love)". The last one that I mentioned can also be heard in the romantic comedy "While You Were Sleeping". I also appreciate the fact that this movie gives us a good look on the beautiful London city, showing some of its most notorious monuments (Big Ben, Tower Bridge, etc...). There are definitely some classic elements in this film that give it a classic feeling.The rest of the movie, however, isn't completely great. It has some nice humor and the butler Martin is a funny dude. But there are also some mean and cruel jokes in Camp Walden during the 2 twin sisters rivalries and plenty of other stupid jokes (like that ridiculous joke with the lizard). Meredith Blake is too-much Cruella DeVil-like when it comes to personality, which is pointless. Sometimes the movie nearly ends up being a joke.Although I really don't like Lindsay Lohan, the truth is that she does a good performance as the twin sisters. Dennis Quaid is quite good as the charming Nick Parker. Natasha Richardson was not only good in the role of Elizabeth James, but also beautiful and elegant (with a Princess Diana-like figure). Simon Kunz makes a hilarious butler Martin. Ronnie Stevens does a good Grandpa Charles James.Overall, not a bad movie. It certainly is okay and watchable, but fails in some small but significant details.</fullReview>

I actually like this updated version a bit better than the original one, although the original was also quite good. It's basically the same story (twin girls separated at birth discover each other at summer camp and decide to switch places in the hopes of reuniting their parents) but the updated version has a more modern feel.The cast is perfect, especially Ms. Lohan in the role of the twins. With all the drugs, alcohol, bulimia, car accidents and other tabloid aspects of her life, it's easy to forget how good an actress Lohan is when she sobers up and eats a healthy diet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1961 vs. 1998</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few movie remakes can be said to be better than the original. The 1998 Parent Trap is one of those rare exceptions. While the 1961 version is a classic story, it looks very much like a movie from its time, giving Disney license to make a more contemporary version. Here's the tale of the tape...The premise: 1961: Susan is from California; Sharon is from Boston. The two take an instant dislike to each other when each has "the nerve" to wear each other's face. 1998: Hallie is from California; Annie is from London. Their faces are hidden in a friendly fencing contest, though it turns ugly when both Annie's touche lands Hallie over a railing and into a large water bucket. Annie tries to help her out, but Hallie pulls her in. The disdain starts seconds before they even see each other's faces. A little more believable.The realization: 1961: Still not getting along in the isolation cabin, one yells at the other over the theory that they indeed are sisters, even though the evidence overwhelmingly proves it. No comments after the "I'm sorry" hug. 1998: Far more warm and fuzzy -- without crossing the sappy line -- in the isolation cabin. After finding common ground in Oreos and peanut butter, the two become weepy and astonished after repairing a ripped photo of their parents. Shot very well.Sign of the times: 1961: Not only do the twins slap each other before the realization, but the father's fiancee also slaps one of the twins. No way you'd see the latter today. 1998: Mother and daughter both agree the arrangement "sucks." No way you'd see that in 1961, nor the 11-year-old girlish "Oh my God"s from Hallie. (I can't think of any other reason why this got a PG and not a G rating.)Music: 1961: Musical numbers that were part of 1960s Disney. 1998: Short, quick music videos that are accepted in a lot of movies.The performances are pretty much a dead heat, and hard to compare considering the times. However, there are differences.The parents: 1961: The characters of Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith (Maggie and Mitch) seem more jaded and angry, both at each other and themselves for unnecessarily throwing something away. 1998: The characters of Natasha Richardson and Dennis Quaid (Elizabeth and Nick) had simply moved on, and had difficulty remembering what broke them up. There was little evidence of any bad blood, though Elizabeth was too reluctant to believe in their love.The fiancee: 1961: Joanna Barnes as Vicky was a young and attractive shrew. 1998: Elaine Hendrix as Meredith was a young, beautiful, sexy, manipulative, and two-faced. It took more time to root against her. (Nice touch with Barnes as Meredith's mother.)The twins: 1961: There's a good reason why the cute blonde was working steadily for many years after The Parent Trap. Hayley Mills had the two characters down to a T, and that Pollyanna quality from her previous film still comes through. That's what Disney wanted in the 1960s. 1998: All the more reason we'll be seeing a lot of Lindsay Lohan. In her movie debut, the auburn-haired, freckle-faced newcomer nailed two characters and two accents, and added some comic touches to her roles. You could see a little more range in Lohan's portrayals. As believable as this story could possibly be, Lohan's performance is the glue to this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rated PG for some mild mischiefPlot Summary: Two identical twins (Lohan),who both no nothing about each other, meet at a summer camp and switch places in an effort to reunite their parents (Quaid and Richardson)Let me tell you about the actors and actresses in this film. I did not see the original so I have nothing to compare this movie to, but I think it is similar tot the movie "It Takes Two". Lindsay Lohan does a brilliant job playing Annie and Hallie, two twins whose parents broke up when they were little. She does sort of an Olsen twins performence, similar to the one in "It Takes Two", where the Olsen twins play twins in the exact same plot. Dennis Quaid does a nice job as the clueless father who is falling into the trap by falling in love with the soon-to-be stepmother, Blake Hendrix in a nice Cruella De Vil performance. The twins try their hardest to get their parents, played by Richardson and Quaid, together, going as far as to make sure the two meet at a hotel while on vacation.This film plays well as a comedy, as the twins adjust to different lifestyles, one is from a rich British house, the other is from a ranch in Northern California, with plenty of sight gags, but as the story goes on, a romance develops, not only between the divorced parents, but also between the butler and the housekeeper, played brilliantly by Kunz and Walters. This movie can also be described as a chick flick, as it fits the category of that and a family film, warm, funny, and romantic, with a preteen lead. I saw this movie first on a plane and was suprised that it was pretty good, and even viewed it a few more times. All in all I thought this was a pretty good flick, and I reccomend it to you, especcially if you are on a date or with your family.My Rating: 6.5 out of 10 or B</fullReview>

The father (Dennis Quaid) lives in California and the mother (Natasha Richardson) lives in London. The father goes to marry with a young (Elaine Hendrix) and the girls are planning the reconciliation parents by the means to create an impossible life to the father's lover.It's a remake of the film featured by Mauren O'Hara and Brian Keith and the daughter Hayley Mills but is adapted to the modern times. Lindsay Lohan interpretation is top notch likeness to Hayley of the previous film,she interprets to both and she performs outstanding. Lohan is actually a star since what she played ¨Mean girls¨number one in United States box office. Special mention deserves Elaine Hendrix as father's bride, her acting is excellent as the ominous and avaricious fiancée. Joanna Barnes who played the bride in the first version here plays Hendrix's mother. In the film there are comedy,tongue in check ,humor and is pretty bemusing . The picture obtained quite success such as the first part. The motion picture will like to familiar comedies fans. Rating: Very nice. Well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great and Enjoyable Entertainment for the Whole Family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hallie Parker (Lindsay Lohan) is an American girl who lives with her father in a viniculture farm in California and never met her mother. Annie James (Lindsay Lohan) is an English girl who lives with her mother in London and never met her father. One day, in a summer camp, they are introduced to each other and they find they are twins. They decide to switch places to have a chance to meet their mother and father. Of course there will be a problem as a plot point along the story, many clichés and a happy end. This is very predictable in this type of movie. When a viewer watches this type of movie produced by Disney, certainly would not be dumb enough to expect a drama, or a credible or realistic story. This is a comedy, almost a fairy tale. And fortunately they do exist, to make the world better. But this story is adorable and the selection of the cast is perfect: Nicholas Parker (Dennis Quaid) is a handsome man, Elizabeth James (Natasha Richardson) is one of the most beautiful and elegant actress, Meredith Blake (Elaine Hendrix) fits perfectly as `Cruela' and the butler, Chessy and the grandfather are actors and actress perfectly selected for the role. Lindsay Lohan is also great in her double role. A great and enjoyable entertainment for the whole family. My vote is nine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all of the comments I've seen here, no-one mentions the greatest special effect ever pulled off... when Hallie pierces Annie's ears. Hallie's ears are pierced, and she realizes that Annie's are not. When Annie objects, Hallie explains that there would be no way that their dad would believe that she had pierced ears when she went to camp, but not when she came home. The only way to pull it off is for Annie to have her ears pierced. When Hallie literally plunges the needle through Annie's earlobe, she (somehow) hits it dead center; and you actually see this with your own eyes! This, to me, is one of the greatest special effects ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Parent Trap 'is a remake of another movie from 1961 with the same title and also remembers a lot'' It Takes Two' with the Olsen twins. Since I watched both movies (''The Parent Trap'' from 1961 and ''It Takes Two'') before this new remake, I found it totally predictable, even this movie having some small differences of the other two. I think the nicest thing about watching this film is to see the young Lindsay Lohan in a cute movie. The first time I watched this movie(1999) Lindsay was not famous, so only now, taking the movie to watch again that I could notice that she was in there. We also have Dennis Quaid as the charming dad of the girls, and the actress who plays Janice(Maggie Wheeler) in 'Friends',as one of the women working in the girls camp.</fullReview>

I never saw a remake out do the original and have its one unique story instead of copying it completely.Mar is a superb villain with her rich girl snobbery, evil smirk and over the top threats towards the girls. She makes Cinderella's stepmother look like a stepford life.The parents, Nick and Elizabeth, had chemistry, were cute and enduring as two people still in love with each other yet afraid to admit it.Another aspect I loved was the side story of the help Jesse and Martain as they fall in love helping the girls with their schemes.The parent trap is an excellent family film and highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first looked at the movie, I thought that it was just going to be just like any other old Disney movie. But this movie blew me away. Lindsay Lohan has done an amazing job in her roles. She plays two twins. All of the characters acting is legit and you will never have that uncomfortable feeling of a bad actor trying to say something.The comedy is good but what I cherish most about about this movie is the message it conveys. The emotion of the movie is pretty overwhelming sometimes. I the sad parts were very sad and the happy parts also will want to make you cry with tears of joy.Overall, this movie teaches you about love and most of all, family. I don't usually write reviews, but this I just couldn't resist. This movie was just hand down absolutely great. It is not directed towards little kids, because it conveys a valuable lesson that applies to all ages. This is one of my favorite movies. A must watch for any age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen this movie in quite some time so when I found it on Netflix last night (well actually, it found me) I clicked play without any hesitation. As I was watching it I kept being reminded why it was one of my childhood favorites. It's so entertaining, especially for a young audience. These two eleven year old girls are sent to summer camp (relatable), they meet each other and find out they're twins (awesome), they each get to travel to the other one's home and meet their long lost parent while pretending to be the daughter they're not (talk about exciting), all the while trying to bring the parents back into each other's arms (so sweet). It's cute, it's funny, it's touching and it's an awesome adventure.For being that young and having to play two very opposite roles, Lindsay Lohan does such a fantastic job. She completely steals the show. Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson are so charming playing her loving parents. The actors are great, the soundtrack is great and the story is easy to follow yet still entertaining. A perfect combination to make the perfect preteen movie. I've never been quite as grateful for my random Netflix suggestions as I was when it suggested I take a dive back into childhood and watch The Parent Trap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the remake of 1961's The Parent Trap starring Hayley Mills as twins Susan and Sharon. Here, Lindsey Lohan takes on the duo roles, but named Hallie Parker and Annie James. The plot is the same as the original: the twin girls meet for the first time at camp and decide to switch places so they could each meet the parent they never met. While concocting a plan to get their divorced parents back together, the plot thickens when their dad Nick Parker (Dennis Quaid) is engaged to gold-digger Meredith Blake (Elaine Hendrix).As with most, if not all, movies from Disney, this one has that definite family feel and is a good film for the younger viewers. However, I think this remake lacks the charm and spirit of the original, and definitely lacks character development and memorable supporting characters (though it was nice seeing Joanna Barnes, the gold-digger in the original movie, appear as Vicki Blake, the mother of the new gold-digger). The overall movie and acting are OK to say the most. It is sometimes difficult to critique a remake as you feel compelled to compare it with the original. However, if you judge this movie as a stand-alone film, I think you would get a movie where it is fun to watch at first, but not one where you would watch repeatedly and one best left for the kids.Grade C</fullReview>

They reunite at summer camp and discover their connection. They devise a plan to switch places to see the other parent, and force them to meet again.The plot is stupid. The premise of splitting twins is draconian. The plan is actually at the level of an 11 year old's mind. It's a farce worthy of early 60s Disney.Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson make for a likable couple. But it's Lindsay Lohan who does some great kid-acting here. She's playing two different characters with two different accents, and she plays them convincingly. It's incredible to see her acting two sides of the same conversation without missing a beat. It's easy to see her potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Parent Trap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Parent Trap, a comedy video co-written by Nancy Meyer, Charles Shyer, and David Swift, is based on true love and finding the other half. Giving the viewers an inside look at a typical split up family with major problems that can be fixed, with a touch of love and explaining to do. From the entire eye catching scenes to the amazing roles being played, thus created a story worth watching. The Parent Trap is a family video that involves two young twin girls Hallie and Annie, both being played by Lindsay Lohan, who never knew they were twins until they both attend the same camp at the same time. Without knowing they were twin sisters, the competition was on and a series of pranks were being pulled on each other. With all that happen they were brought closer than they could have ever imagine, and it just so happened to be a life changing experience for them both. Meanwhile, trying to restore what they have missed out about the other parent, they decided to switch places, "I'll teach you to be me, and you can teach me to be you," quoted by Hallie Parker. With all of the chaotic planning, switching of homes, and getting rid of the soon to be evil step mother, the two girls bring everyone together as one big family again. One important factor in having a good film is to see if the acting seems natural, without it being too awkward or overboard. In the film the young Lindsey Lohan played both of her characters very well, knowing that in reality she's not a twin, but pulling it off as if she really was a twin. One of the main roles in the movie was to speak in a British accent in which Lohan spoked it flawlessly. Another two character that gave this movie a little romance in the air were Elizabeth James (Natasha Richardson) and Nick Parker (Dennis Quaid). Asides from Quaid's good looks and stunning blue eyes, we catch Richardson and Quaid eye locking in scenes that really did seem like they were meant to be after all. Another important element is the plot. Overall this movie was pretty easy to understand giving the viewer's good details, like the switching up places. The producer gave a very good two to three minutes just showing the twins teaching each other how to be each other. The flow of the storyline was smooth and the scenes transitioned easily. After all The Parent Trap is a comedy based genre, giving a family a good laugh out of it. It's not completely boring to watch, because all the action and the teasing keeps the film entertaining. Like when the soon to be stepmother woke up in the middle of the lake and getting attacked by a bird, the viewer's definitely knew who planned all of this. Asides from one happy ending, this movie is inspiring to us all, because of how each of the characters never gave up. It only showed us of them striving to be one big family again, by how convincing the characters might of been.</fullReview>

Lindsay Lohan what can I say but a wonderful job done,, playing 2 characters,, all of those lines to remember, and which character says them,, wow very impressive at that age,, however old she was at the time.. I guess this was her young and innocent age,, because we all know now what happened to Lindsay.. so anyway back to the film . 2 girls are sent to Summer Camp unbeknown-st to each other at first that they are identical twins. they meet and fight and argue,, then they slowly become friends and start talking to one another,, one thing leads to another and the sisters slowly start to figure out that they are blood related sisters, well neither one has seen the other parent, one lives with mom and the other with dad, so they decide to pull the old switcheroo and trick the parents,, this way the can spend time with the other parent,, how ingenious this was I thought. excellent movie for the whole family to watch,, and a joy seeing a young and innocent Linsday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay I actually have not seen the original, but I really like this movie so I'm not going to bother ruining it for me. This was Lindsay Lohan's debut, and although she's a terrible human being now she honestly was a great actress. She does a great job at her young age of portraying her characters. The movie is about twin sisters separated at birth when their parents divorced only to accidentally come face to face at summer camp eleven years later. At first they are rivals, and pull various pranks on each other until they are punished and forced into solitude for the rest of the duration of the camp. They slowly start to learn about each other and realize they are twin sisters. Each wants to meet their other parent very badly, so they switch places. They run into some unexpected problems when they discover their father is about to wed a beautiful young gold digger and work together to reunite their parents before the wedding. This movie is good for people of all ages, and it is surprisingly not corny. Dennis Quaid does a fantastic job of being the goofy, lovable father that puts his daughter first and you come to adore him. Well done Disney!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved this movie and I still do</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I decided to watch this on VHS that I recorded years ago off the TV and surprisingly I really enjoyed this one. Lindsay Lohan plays twins who decide to swap places in order to see their other half that they never met before. So the British girl (Lohan)goes to California to meet her estrangled father played by Dennis Quaid(who I swear has such a nice smiley face all the time)while the American girl Hayliee(again Lohan) goes to the UK London to see her mom(played by the late Natasha Richardson who was in Maid In Manhattan). SO its up to Hayliee and Annie to get their parents back together again. But will Quaid and Richardson fall in love again?Yes its a bit silly having the same girl acting two parts,but for what its worth The Parent Trap is still one of my favourite movies to this day. Lohan was in mighty form as both twins,while Quaid and Richardson had some sizzling romance going on. Elaine Hendrix who plays the bitch from hell(Quaid's on screen from hell) was also really good in this movie.The story is very sweet and lovely and as for the rest well I still love this movie even up to this very day.Bottom line if you never seen it yet watch it.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you think of a classic movie that everyone will enjoy, The Parent Trap is one that will for sure be appealing to people of all ages. The film is a great remake of the original 1961 film, and the new cast did an awesome job with their roles. The film is well directed with great filming and production and even though the same actress plays the leading role as two people, the film is put together seamlessly. When two identical girls meet unexpectedly at summer camp, they knew they had to be related. After almost twelve years, the twins, Hallie Parker and Annie James (doubly-played by Lindsay Lohan), were finally reunited with one another. They were separated at birth when their parents got divorced. One twin went to England with their mother, Elizabeth Parker (played by Natasha Richardson), and the other with their father, Nick Parker (played by Dennis Quaid). After summer camp, they wanted to meet their other parent that the hadn't seen since they were born, so they had the bright idea that they would switch lives and go to the other twin's house. They each pretend to be one another as they lived their new lives in opposite sides of the world, but while Annie is meeting her father, he tells her the unexpected news that he is going to get married to his new fiancé named Meredith Blake (played by Elaine Hendrix). Annie calls Hallie immediately and, long story short, that's when they come up with a plan to bring Elizabeth James back to the wedding so they can "trap" them and get them to fall in love with each other again. The cast of the film does a great job playing their characters and they really make the movie come together perfectly, especially Lindsay Lohan. When you watch the movie, you forget that it is the same girl that is playing both girls. She does such a good job at making the characters totally different with their accents and personalities that you forget that it is the same girl playing that part. Lohan does an outstanding job at making the movie go seamlessly together and to make it seem like real life. This movie is very well crafted. The directors did a great job with the locations that the film is shot at, and making sure that these scenes go together and fit together like a glove. Starting with the camp, where the girls meet, to their dad's house in Napa Valley, to the mom's house in England, to the camp grounds where they go through good times with their father and new step mother, to the hotel and wedding site to the end of the movie where Elizabeth and Nick come back to the Queen Elizabeth where they first got married. I liked how it had a variety of different scenes that took place in different destinations all over the world, and the producers and filmmakers did a good job at making sure you knew exactly where everything happened. The camera footage and production of the film really enhanced the movie. When they filmed certain things, they had just the right angle to make you feel like you were in the movie. One particular example is when they were camping with Nick and Meredith and the twins played a prank and put a lizard on her Evian bottle. The camera got the lizard coming towards her mouth so it looked like it was happening to you. Another example is when they prank the girls in the cabin. They had all kinds of traps set up so that when you walked or opened a door, something would fall on you-and the cameras were there to capture each time something fell. There was a part where a huge bucket of chocolate syrup was poured on one girl, and the cameras were there to let you watch it fall from the bucket to the top of the girl's head. Without the great production and footage that the cameras got this movie wouldn't have been as good. This movie is one that will never get old, no matter how many times you watch it. Once you see the film, you without a doubt will want to watch it again. All the actors and directors and producers and everyone else involved in making this film were definitely successful, and they did a great job with the movie. This is one you will for sure want to see at least once within your lifetime!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Winning Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Parent Trap is a remake of the 1961 family film of the same title. It was directed and co-written by Nancy Meyers. It stars Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson as a couple who divorce soon after marrying, and Lindsay Lohan in a dual role as their twin daughters, who are accidentally reunited after being separated at birth.At a summer camp in Maine, 11-year-old Hallie Parker meets Annie James. Despite a curious resemblance, Hallie develops an immediate dislike for Annie, and the feeling is mutual. However, the two eventually discover they are twin sisters separated not long after they were born. Their parents, Elizabeth and Nick, had met on the Queen Elizabeth 2 and married on that same voyage. After a divorce, Nick brought up Hallie at his Napa Valley vineyard, while Annie lived with wedding-gown designer Elizabeth in London. Neither twin was aware she had a sister, until their summer-camp meeting. To learn more about their parents, they switch places and maintain the deception until Nick states he will remarry. The twins then try to engineer a renewed romance between Nick and Elizabeth, but Nick's annoying but attractive fiancée Meredith presents a major problem in reaching their happy-ending goal.Writer-director Nancy Meyers takes the winning formula of the original and gives it an amiable modern spin in this remake.Young star Lindsay Lohan shines in her breakout role while Richardson and Quaid have great chemistry despite limited time on screen.Overall,it this light comedy is sweetly timed, the direction smart and assured, and the visuals bright, colorful, unobtrusive and faultless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully Cheerful Fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I have to say, I haven't seen the original film before, but I will say when people mention good remakes, this one is often forgotten. If you want an excellent, well polished well sparked remake, this is the one! Back two years ago, I watched Martin Scoursese's Cape Fear which I found was outstanding, but now that has changed since I saw this remake from 1998. This is one of the better remakes in many years of a total line up of them. However, since I haven't seen the original at all, I will not be comparing this film with Lindsay Lohan to the 1961 version. (Warning, some spoilers are in here, so if you have not seen this film, please don't read everything).The film sets on a warm sunny day, set 11 years later from these parents who were married, had twins and then separated, where one took one twin to live in England while the other was taken to live in California. 11 years from that setting, the two twins meet each other at summer camp and then find out about each other. This leads them to fact that they are alike and the two twins, Annie and Hal become eager and determined to reunite their parents together.This was a really fun film to watch, my expectations weren't high and I thought that it would've been a decent film. I was totally wrong as this film is well casted, has a memorable music score, has some beautiful looking scenes and the anticipation, twists and overall plot of the film are all shown in great forms and shapes. The story is told beautifully as it is done through the perspectives of the two twin girls (played by Lindsay Lohan) who are wanting their parents to be back together.First off, I have to mention the musical score; I thought it was hauntingly enchanting, peaceful and quiet and it really had a melody to it. It also suited the acting of Lindsay Lohan as Annie and Hal who I thought did a stunning job. They were, mischievous, cheerful, cute and awesome in one pack! She does a real great job as the two characters and she is definitely the light of the film with her different accents, playful pranks on the father's girlfriend and explorative minds.Many of the places of where the scenarios take place were a good choice for the film to. Hotels, pool areas, the country, camping sites, cabins, crowded streets, its all there and it was really great to see so many different places that the girls could explore.The cast and choice of actors/actresses were wisely picked out and like I mentioned before, Lohan was the best and the star. Everyone I would give credit to too as they were excellent in their roles, showing seriousness and funniness.Lastly, I'd talked about some of the unpredictable plot twists in the film. When I thought the mother and father weren't going to get back together, I was thinking, its not going to be a happy ending! It was paced really well about how they were going to show the mother and father getting back together again. The ending (I wont talk about) I was stoked! Overall, The Parent Trap from 1998 is excellent piece of film from the very late 90's which has much potential. Loving the film as I do, I would say it is, hands down, the best film I have seen this year! It marks a 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really sweet and funny movie. Great job from the cast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing the trailer for The Parent Trap in the summer of 1998. I had already seen and enjoyed the original 1961 movie but was quite impressed by what I had seen in the trailer. Unlike many of the remakes that are coming out these days, this looked quite refreshing and an unexpected hit from Disney. So when I finally saw the film two times in the theater that August, I couldn't have been more impressed. Yes, this maybe the only movie to date that I viewed in the theater twice and for my vote, it was for good reason.This is a fun, witty and sweet little movie that I continue to enjoy. A lot of this is due to Disney getting Nancy Myers to co-write the screenplay and direct the film. She had been writing screenplays for years by this time and even had a few hits in her resume, Father Of The Bride Parts 1 and 2 being the most successful. To make her directorial debut, she agreed to helm a remake of the classic 1961 film for Disney. They couldn't have hired anyone better. A tremendous talent in screen writing and directing and deserves to be placed with Frank Capra, Preston Sturges and Billy Wilder. While this is you could say a children's film, Myers provides enough class and wit that people of all ages can enjoy it.As for the cast, everyone did a great job and bring a lot of humor and sensitivity to the characters. Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson was amazing casting and both play the mother and father roles in the most believable way. I enjoy their scenes together. Of course, there is the delightful Lindsey Lohan. I really don't know what to say about her personally but as an actress, she is a remarkable talent and this movie shows it. I remember being impressed by the trailer at her capabilities to pull it off. She's quirky, fresh and fun to watch in both roles as Hallie and Annie.Dean Cundey was the cinematographer on this film who is known for his wide variety of work, from Halloween (1978) to The Thing (1982), from Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) to Jurassic Park (1993), from Apollo 13 (1995) to The Parent Trap. Because of his brilliance, he was brought in for the film's amazing technical work. Montion control had been used before many times and even Nancy Myers herself has said that she wasn't sure how it works but it is used to astonishing effect here. With Lohan's talent to play the wisecracking Hallie and proper Annie, motion control allows you to appreciate the differences in the two twins and also, the similarities. My favorite shot in the movie is when Lohan as both Hallie and Annie are looking in the mirror after Annie gets her hair cut. A one shot that gives the young actress a chance to walk in and out of frame as well as give lots of dialog.All in all, this is a great movie in my opinion. It's a feel good movie with a lot of charm and as I say class that I highly recommend it. Rent it or better yet, buy it if you ever get the chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly GOOD!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Uusually I'd say remakes are marginally good at best, but I'll have to admit, this one's a HOOT! I LOVED the original, with Haley Mills, Brian Keith, and Maureen O'Hara, and I'd have to vote the original just a bit higher--BUT--This one is a true gem, and the cast was FAN-DAM-TASSTIC!!! Dennis Quaid was the absolute PERFECT fit for Keith's part, and I love the fact that the actress who played "Vicky" in the first one, Joanna Barnes, RETURNS--37 years later, {as beautiful as ever}!--playing Daddy's spoilt pretty-faced fiancé's MOTHER, "Vicki" this time! And the chemistry, ohh--The chemistry between Quaid, and Natasha Richardson, was simply divine! Maybe a little too, perhaps, because I, for one, never reeally could see how they'd have split in the first place--whyy?!! But this rather quick jump into love again in no way detracts from the movie's deliciousness. Lindsay Lohan gave a smashing, and natural performance in this, her debut feature, a sure-to-be classic for decades to come. One of the things I liked most about it is that it didn't go the way of many remakes by smothering it with too much of today's attitude, and modernisations. VERY well done!If there is a formula for doing remakes spot on right, then this one follows it perfectly!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We give Lizzie and Nick high reels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another example of a couple that barely spend 15 minutes of screen time together; nevertheless we feel that we saw enough to give Lizzie and Nick high reels. They had good physical chemistry, and of course, there's those adorable twins (although even parents as capable as these two must shudder at the thought of teenage Lindsay Lohans).Lizzie and Nick met and married many years ago but the hotheaded young newlyweds quickly found life together intolerable - plenty of passion but too much pain. They decided to separate; each taking one of their identical twin daughters with them. Nick settled in Napa and became a wine magnate; Lizzie fled home to the UK where she became Elizabeth James, the Vera Wang of England. Neither one has told their daughter about their spouse or that they have a twin. It is not until the girls turn 10 that they finally meet at a summer camp, and plot to get their parents back together.While the outcome is inevitable it is one we agree with. There is no doubt the love and attraction are still there and both seem to have matured considerably so the angry, hairdryer-throwing tantrums will hopefully be a thing of the past. And of course they have a shared love of their two daughters.There's a small matter of geography to be sure but as both Nick and Lizzie are both well off and successful we think they'll make it work. She'll probably move to California but take the girls on trips to Europe. The four of them will be a happy, successful, well-traveled family.Reel Thing Rating: 5 out of 5 Reelshttp://www.reel-couples.com/the-couple-elizabeth-james-nick-parker/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even more family friendly than the original. Very watchable for all ages. But it will fulfill your sugar requirements for the day. And similar to sugar you might not want your kids (especially girls) to watch this before bed. Some of them go quite hyper at the thought of having a natural co-conspirator living with them 24x7.Looking forward to the rumored #2 modern remake where things take a modern twist after the camper conclude that they are twins. The parental confrontation reveals that their mothers were the actual twins and with twin fathers accounting for their similar looks. So the kids are not actually twins. The happy moment is resolving difficulties between the parental twins who have not spoken since the long ago girlfriend/boyfriend theft incident. I think M. Night Shyamalan is directing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say The Parent Trap is a good movie. I remember my two cousins Lacey and Marissa taking me to see it when it came out and I was worried that I might not like it because it's a girls' movie and I'm a guy but I'm glad that they took me to see it because I really enjoyed it. The plot was pretty good about two girls named Annie and Hallie who were separated at birth and meet each other at camp and plan to get their parents back. I thought Lindsay Lohan gave a good performance playing both of the twins. No one else could of done it better and I also thought that Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson gave good performances as the twins' parents. I also thought that Elaine Hendrix gave a good villainous performance as the snobby gold digger Meredith Blake who tries to marry the twins' father. The films also has a lot of hilarious scenes that'll have you laughing really hard. All in all The Parent Trap is a good movie that the whole family can enjoy. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What you see is what you get with "The Parent Trap".It's funny,it's sad,it's corny as all get out,but it's surely entertaining and leaves you with a warm glow. Mr Quaid the late Miss Richardson are spot - on as the parents and the gifted Miss L. Lohan is quite enchanting in her dual role as the identical twins who conspire to reunite them. Much as I love Hayley Mills I have to admit Miss Lohan is more convincing - aided somewhat by the technical advances of the last 40 - odd years. But the whole movie is like a gorgeous cocoon keeping us safe from the realities of the world and I loved it. There are of course two tragedies attached to this film;the dreadful accident that cost Miss Richardson her life and the and the apparently ceaseless descent into the worst sort of notoriety that has engulfed Miss Lohan. Perhaps she could consider what a fragile thing life is,thrust away from us at fate's whim,and not continually tempt the same fate that took Miss Richardson from us. After all,"The Parent Trap" is a life - affirming film which can make us feel everything will be alright in the end even as we know it probably won't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By far and away one of the better remakes out there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard there was a remake of the thoroughly enjoyable 1961 original, I wasn't so sure whether I wanted to see it. I did see it however, and I was pleasantly surprised. This film is really cute, touching and funny, with a wonderfully light tone; it isn't as good as the original but it is definitely one of the better remakes out there, and this is coming from someone who has seen her share of some truly awful ones(ie. Psycho and The Wicker Man-at least the latter had some entertainment value for the wrong reasons!).The 1998 film does have its small problems though. If you know the plot of the film already, you may find it formulaic and predictable here, I found it very original in the 1961 film, not so much here. Like the 1961 film, the film is a little too long, and it does play loose with some of London's geography and lifestyles.Flaws aside, what we do have is a light, funny, upbeat and touching film, elevated by a witty and snappy script, adept direction, gorgeous cinematography and scenery, a breezy soundtrack and of course some great acting. Lindsey Lohan had a lot to live up to, considering how outstanding Hayley Mills was, and thanks to some superb make up, she does a really good job in one of her better performances. Just for the record, she has done some good performances such as in this, Freaky Friday and Mean Girls, but she has also been in some mediocre to bad movies especially Get a Clue. Not only is The Parent Trap one of her better movies her dual role performance is one of her better performances too. In terms of supporting performances, Dennis Quaid is great as the father, very cute and funny and actually more at home than Brian Keith was I feel, while the late Natasha Richardson is drop dead gorgeous in this movie.Overall, just a delightful remake of a delightful original. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Parent Trap is exactly the sort of easy-going, endlessly engaging family film that seems to have become an unusually rare breed. This thoroughly enjoyable 1998 remake of the 1961 comedy hit starring Hayley Mills packs plenty of humor and emotional punch. Nancy Meyers directs Lindsay Lohan, who plays 11-year-old twins separated at birth when their parents divorced. In the first two minutes of the Disney classic The Parent Trap, Meyers perfectly, and wordlessly, depicts the heart warming love story of Elizabeth James (Natasha Richardson) and Nicholas Parker (Dennis Quaid) through their spontaneous, yet undeniably gorgeous, wedding aboard the serene ocean liner the "QEII" (Queen Elizabeth II). "11 years and nine months later" flashes across the black screen and the movie refocuses on Camp Walden, an eight-week summer camp for girls in the woods of picturesque Maine. A typical, child-like rivalry quickly develops between two o f the girls at the camp: Hallie Parker, sassy and very sure of herself, and Annie James, ladylike, reserved, but quite stubborn. Of course having the exact same hair color, eye color, height, and freckles as each other isn't enough to even suggest to either Hallie or Annie that they could possibly be related. It takes immature pranks, the 'isolation cabin', and their mutual adoration for poker and Oreo's with peanut butter to figure that out. It takes about five minutes for the girls to scheme up a plan to reunite their father and their mother by going home to each others parent after camp. With a little help from their nannies, Hallie and Annie set out to rekindle their parent's relationship and achieve the whole, happy family they've always wanted. The only problem is that their father announces his engagement to Meredith Blake, a gold-digging publicity agent half his age, shortly after "Hallie" (Annie) comes home. In its own way, The Parent Trap celebrates the ideal of family ties as one of the pre-eminent virtues of our time. Lindsay Lohan truly makes determines the effectiveness of the film with her ability to impeccably persuade the viewer that she is two distinct, separate characters. I have listened to and watched The Parent Trap every night for the past two months on my iPod while falling asleep, and I intend to for many more months. The genuinely happy movie and its characters never seem to become repetitive; I still, as a fifteen-year-old, get excited every time it plays on Disney Channel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The charming remake of the same charming film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Parent Trap 1998 is a Disney remake of a 1961 Disney film of the same name, with both films being adapted from Erich Kästner's novel titled Lottie and Lisa (Das Doppelte Lottchen). This one is directed by Nancy Meyers and stars Dennis Quaid, Natasha Richardson, Lindsay Lohan, Elaine Hendrix, Lisa Ann Walter and Simon Kunz. The plot sees Lohan playing 11 year old identical twins, Hallie and Annie, who on account of their parents divorce when they were born, have lived separate lives unaware of the other's existence. Hallie was raised in America by her father, Nick {Quaid} while Annie was brought up in London with her mother, Lizzie {Richardson}. But fate intervenes in the girls future when they are both enlisted at the same summer camp, where after some unaware aggressive rivalry, the girls realise they are actually sisters. Thus they decide to swap places and go to live with the parent they have never known. And maybe, just maybe, they can get mom &amp; dad back together again.The word amiable is the first thing that springs to mind come the end of a viewing of this version of The Parent Trap. It has no pretensions to be anything other than the smile inducing family comedy that it is. Something for the kids comes courtesy of the shenanigans and set pieces that involve Lohan's dual sisters, while the adults, if so inclined, get a nice sweet romantic story that's not shy in the laugh department either. Disney's original film from 61 starring Hayley Mills has a firm fan base and is fine just the way it is. So why a remake then? And why a remake that's not really doing anything different? Well the cynical could point to a cash motivation, but I really feel that Disney just wanted to update a lovely story and bring it to a new audience. Besides which there's a lot of love shown to the original, with nods and references ensuring that nobody is in any doubt about this update knowing its family tree.The cast are well worth their corn. Lohan is perky and handles both accents of her characters very well. Asked to basically carry the weight of the film, she does so with such agreeable ease, it's not hard to understand why she was being touted for big things back on release of the film. The two main adult actors are, in truth, not required to do a great deal of depth seeking. But both Richardson and the criminally undervalued Quaid play it right and engage from the get go. It's with the adult support that The Parent Trap surprisingly pleases the most. Simon Kunz as Annie &amp; Lizzie's butler Martin is a total joy and reason enough to stay with the film thru its over long running time. Lisa Ann Walter as the other "house keeper" Chessy, also impacts, both on a comedic level and as an emotional centre as the plot pulls together. Which leaves Elaine Hendrix as the gold digging, self centred babe, Meredith Blake, who's out to snag Nick into marriage and upset the applecart big time. As the only villain of the film it would have been easy to just play it one dimensional, but Hendrix is asked to offer up a bit more, and she does, especially during a fun filled, and character outing, camping trip.It is too long at just over two hours, and you got to wonder about the callous side of the parental decision glossed over by Disney. But this kind of family fare is prescription medicine for the cold of heart. It may be undemanding too, but if you find yourself in need of a break from head scratching Indies or machismo fuelled actioners. Then you may just find that this film gets in and does just the job you want it too. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the sisters that finally met</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main actors in this movie are Mary-Kate and Ashley, and this movie was about two twins who were sisters and were separated at birth. Their parents got a divorce, so they never met; they also never knew that they had a sister until the day they meet at a camp that they were both sent to for 3 months. They decided to switch places; the one that has lived with her family for her whole life will now go to live with the mother, and the one that has been living with the mother will go with her father. The setting of this movie is mainly at the camp that they are at, but once the 3 months is up and they go back home the setting switches to the mother's house, father's house and somewhat in a hotel. Some parts that I thought were done well and were pretty cool was when the sisters set up all of these traps everywhere in the camp and started pranking all of the other campers that were there. It was also cool and funny when they did really mean things to their step mom while they were on a camping trip, but they really only did it so that their step mom would break up with their dad. Then their dad will be able to be back with the original mom again, and they would be a normal family again. All the parts in this movie were actually done really good, and you didn't want to stop watching it. In the end I really enjoyed watching this movie, and I feel like I could watch it over and over again. This is a movie that always keeps you interested, and you don't want to stop watching it; you want to see what happens next. It was a funny movie but also romantic and sad at some points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film which first launched Li-Lo onto an unsuspecting world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hallie Parker is an eleven-year-old girl who lives in California with her father Nick, a successful winemaker. She knows very little about her mother, from whom Nick was divorced when she was a baby, and is completely unaware that she has an identical twin sister living in England. Annie James is an eleven-year-old girl who lives in London with her mother Elizabeth, a successful fashion designer. She knows very little about her father, from whom Elizabeth was divorced when she was a baby, and is completely unaware that she has an identical twin sister living in America. And then, quite by chance, Hallie and Annie meet when they are sent to the same summer camp. They quickly realise that they are in fact sisters, and decide that it is their mission in life to reunite their parents. To achieve this ambition they hit upon a plan. Hallie will return to London, pretending to be Annie, and Annie will return to California, pretending to be Hallie. The one obstacle to their plans seems to be Nick's fiancée Meredith, attractive and seemingly charming but really scheming and mercenary. There are plenty of plot holes in this film. I cannot see any divorce court, on either side of the Atlantic, sanctioning the bizarre arrangement Nick and Elizabeth evidently made about the future of their children. (The courts are often reluctant to split up siblings, especially twins). The British aristocracy do not normally send their children to American summer camps. (Elizabeth's father, with whom she lives in a huge London mansion, is evidently from the upper classes). Is it really conceivable that neither Nick nor Elizabeth would have told their child that she has a sister? And is it conceivable that neither of them would have seen through the deception that was being practised upon them, especially as Lindsay Lohan's English accent, both as Annie and as Hallie-pretending-to-be-Annie, often slips? (Hallie-pretending-to-be-Annie is eventually exposed by her grandfather, and Annie-pretending-to-be-Hallie by her father's maid). Fortunately, this is the sort of film in which plot holes do not really matter, being a romantic comedy, not a serious, realistic drama. It effectively revives the "comedy of remarriage", a sub-genre of romantic comedy which deals with a divorced or separated couple who rediscover their love for one another. This type of film was very popular in the thirties and forties ("The Philadelphia Story" is perhaps the best-known example) and to a lesser extent in the sixties (the original "Parent Trap" was made with Hayley Mills in 1961) but has become less common in recent years. There was perhaps a reason why Disney decided to remake this film and revive the genre. The story differs from most rom-coms in an important respect. Most romantic comedies focus upon the lovers themselves, but in this one Dennis Quaid as Nick and Natasha Richardson as Elizabeth end up playing supporting roles to the triumphal entry of Lindsay Lohan onto the world stage. This was, of course, the film which first launched Li-Lo onto an unsuspecting world, and it is she who steals the show. One film was all it took to establish herself as the most self-assured, charismatic and lovable child star of the age, just as Hayley Mills was in 1961. (Like Hayley, Lindsay plays both sisters). The focus on the film's child star makes it ideal for a family audience, whereas most romantic comedies are intended primarily for adults. I've never actually seen the 1961 version so I can't compare the two, unlike many reviewers who seem to have a definite preference for one version or the other. The 1998 version is no great masterpiece, but it is an amiable and likable family comedy with a great little heroine. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original 'Parent Trap' is a classic wonderful delightful film. Why on earth did Disney decide to remake it? Wouldn't it be better to take a bad movie of theirs and remake it into a good movie? Why mess with perfection? Despite having said all that, I enjoyed the remake. Les Miserables is the only Broadway musical I ever saw and I saw it in Boston. If I went to London and saw the same show, it would more or less be the same show, but with the personal touch that each cast brings to the performance. That is how it was with the remake of the Parent Trap.The original is not better because it is the first version I saw, but because it has more charm overall because of the delightful Hayley Milles. It also has Hayley Milles beating up herself. The remake has Linsey Lohan having a sword fight with herself which she pulls off nicely and little Linsey is so cute and adorable. The first movie had a nicely flowing story pace while the remake had a more logically revealing storyline. You learn a little bit more about what caused the Parent's breakup in the first place. The people's reactions in the first film are more realistic and natural then in the remake, except for that of the nurse maid on the Father's side. She cries up a storm when she finds out the true identity of the girl she hasn't seen since she was one years old. The new version also has Dennis Quaid which is usually a good idea for any casting director. What worked to make the story a success the first time around, they included this time around. They structure the story differently but just as effectively. The ending of the first one worked really well and the ending of this Parent Trap ends equally well but in a different way. They could not have fit the new ending in the older version for technological reasons. But the new ending makes more sense story wise then the former all the former is quite good as well. The Remake of the Parent Trap deserves a place next to the Original Parent Trap in your family library. It might even be fun to watch the two and then compare them. The movies together and by themselves make for an evening of in-depth discussion and entertainment. If your brave you can then watch Parent Trap 2 and then realize how much better the other two films really are. If they remake Parent Trap 2, lets hope it's better then the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite live-action Disney movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie, I had no idea I was in for such a treat. The 1998 version of The Parent Trap proves to be even better than the great 1961 original. In her film debut, Lindsay Lohan plays her dual role perfectly, actually appearing to be two completely different people. Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson are also excellent as the parents, and their interactions are some of the best scenes in the movie. The acting is excellent, and the film is funny, touching (especially the scene with the girls finding out they're sisters for the first time), and entertaining. The film could also be considered a romantic comedy, and it's easily the best one of those I've ever seen. I really don't know why I love this film. It's neither the funniest nor the most intelligent film I've seen, yet it amazes me each time, and it's one of the few movies that makes me cry. Most of the movies on my list of favorites aren't like this one, but I love it nonetheless. I have watched it many times and I am not tired of it yet. My favorite live-action Disney movie, and one of my favorite films.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS:As a remake, this wasn't bad at all. It isn't as god as the original, in my opinion but is still a lot of fun to watch. The essential story is the same though a few minor details are changed.I liked Lohan's work in this but found the casting of Natasha Richardson to be the best thing about it. This is the kind of story that never feels dated. It's completely family friendly and kind of a classic, so, even though I don't always like remakes, I think this was a great movie to remake.I'd say this version is a little wackier then the original(though I saw the first one so long ago it's tough to remember) but by and large there are not all that many differences and if one is seeing the story for the first time, without having seen the original they will still probably get a lot of enjoyment from this version.The fact that the story wasn't to changed, as well as the wonderful casting made this a lot of fun to watch. I;d give this a strong 7.5 and recommend it..the original AND the remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lindsay was so good in these sweet Disney film remakes, but I have to ask, where has her talent gone? Is she partying so hard that her work is suffering?! While I can't say this work is delightful, like I do say about the original, it is quite charming.Lindsay Lohan is no Haley Mills, that's for sure, but her younger performances are quite endearing. Unfortunately, she has not carried that desirable character trait forward in her career. Indeed, if she continues along her current vein, I wouldn't be surprised at all, if she ends up without a career.This is an enjoyable movie, if you're not a Lohan fan. Otherwise, it may serve too well as a reminder of the beautiful talent inside the self-destructive waif she is now.It rates a 6.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this movie is quite silly, it is also hilariously funny.The movie is about a family of two twin girls, Halley and Annie, and their parents who met on a cruise from England to America, but they separated when the girls were very young. The father, Nick Parker, goes to live in California with Halley, and the mother, Elizabeth James, goes to live in England with Annie. The two girls meet at summer camp and decide to switch places. Nick Parker has become engaged to an awful woman, Meredith, who the girls nickname "Cruella". She only wants to marry Nick for his money and plans to send Annie to boarding school. Annie hears of her plans and calls Halley for help. The two girls set a date for their parents to meet each other again and their mother hopes to switch the girls back. But Nick doesn't know of these plans and is simply meeting Meredith's parents. What will happen next? Will Nick and Elizabeth remarry or will the girls be switched back? The movie has so many cute and funny lines from all the characters, and it's never dull. I've seen the movie more than four times, and I still love it.</fullReview>

I got a good look at her face and realized that she played the father's scheming fiancé in the original movie! Just to be sure, I looked it up on IMDb and there it was! She's Vickie Blake in this movie and Vickie Robinson in the original. Just thought that was pretty cool! I loved that they kept with the original film, but just updated it a little bit. And even though there are no musical numbers in this film like there was in the other one, they do have one little clip with Hallie singing "Let's Get Together" while waiting for the elevator. I can't remember how old I was when I first saw the original movie, but I'm 26 now and I still love this movie. When I have kids, I hope it will be one of their favorites as well!</fullReview>

A remake of the 1961 Hayley Mills version, the movie is updated for current times while keeping the classic details and plot devices of the original film. Lindsay Lohan does a great job portraying the twin sisters, to the point that I first thought two different girls were playing Hallie and Annie. She has a lot of talent, and she is so cute. I'm sure she'll do some really good films once she matures into an adult. Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson have awesome chemistry, and it's great to see them on-screen together.

		<shortDescription>Much more enjoyable/believable than the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Technology has advanced to the point where the "twins" can easily be shown together (and much more often than the original) without the "overlay" being apparent which makes the film more believable than the original. Both Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson play "softer" characters than Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith which makes their love for their children more believable and Richardson has a natural smile that can only be described as infectious. Elaine Hendrix is the woman you love to hate as the "other woman" and I especially enjoyed how both Nick and Elizabeth's hired household help mirrored their lifestyles and personalities. And finally, Lindsay Lohan did an excellent job of playing two entirely different people at the beginning of the movie but as they become more familiar with each other their personalities merge to one as you would expect with twins.In my opinion today's comedies are not that "funny" but the last 30 minutes of this movie after Nick and Elizabeth meet for the first time in 11 years is as funny as anything I have seen in quite some time. The hike to the campsite and the time they spend at the campsite was possibly funniest 5 to 7 minutes of a movie I have seen in the last 15 years. This is one of the few non-animated movies Disney has done in quite some time that they felt comfortable associating their name with as opposed slapping the Touchstone label on. However, this movie can also be both very touching and very hurtful at points if you are a divorced parent of a young child. You may want to think about letting your child see this because it could build their hopes up.</fullReview>

Remember, this is only a movie.Meredith is obviously none too bright if she believes that Nick is going to choose her over the girls or that she can make the girls lives hell. The two girls would simply move to England and live with their mother. But, this is movie and as such is not intended to be logical.All in all, I hope that Ms. Lohan eventually is in a movie that allows her to use her acting talents.

In 1961 with Hayley Mills she was the girlfriend and in 1998 with Lindsey Lohan she was the mother of the girlfriend. I enjoyed the movie in 1961 and also in 1998. Good plot and a fun movie. It is really a good movie to watch on a Saturday afternoon when the weather is too hot or wet. The new twist of the movie in the 1998 version was the Butler and housekeeper becoming involved and engaged. The comparison of Brian Keith and Quaid as the Dads were good although I give the edge to Brian. The first "Parent Trap" is my favorite as it was a great Disney flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I will admit it, though it will be with a slight feeling of shame.I really love this movie.Even if I wasn't as large a fan of Lindsay Lohan as I am, I would still have to say she did excellently with playing the roles. I remember, in my childhood, when I first saw the movie, I thought they had just managed to miraculously find a girl who so closely resembled Lohan.Why? When you watch this movie, you do not see Lindsay Lohan. You honestly do feel like you are seeing two different girls- Annie and Hallie.I know the story is incredibly over the top. I never saw the original, so I have no idea what they did in that, but, the chances of you going to the same camp as your long lost twin, realizing that you are twins, and then deciding to switch lives is very improbable.Which leads me to wonder...would a judge really agree to separate twins? Would custody of one parent be given to one child and one to the other like that? And would the parents really have been able to live like that for almost 12 years, not having any idea what happened to their other child? So, I know it's really silly. Scold me if you like.It's that simple fact, though- that this movie makes you wonder- that makes it so wonderful. No pun intended.This is the kind of movie that makes you wonder if maybe you have a long lost twin somewhere, and would you have been able to switch with them? Would your parents, also, not realize it was you? It tickles the imagination in such a way as to fill one (uhm, like me) with that utterly sappy "warm and fuzzy" feeling.The movie is definitely not a serious one- but that only adds to it more. The sense of humor isn't particularly over the top, or stupidly silly. This makes the film something that children- and adults- can honestly enjoy.Do I have a long lost twin somewhere? Probably not.It's this kind of film though that makes you wish you did, and almost believe it is possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney might be falling down on the job of making family films that actually interest the whole family, but every so often they manage to make one that shines. "The Parent Trap" is one of those films.In this remake of the 1961 classic, 2 twins Hallie and Annie (Lindsay Lohan), were separated at birth, when their parents divorced. They are reunited, by chance, at summer camp. The two of them quickly hatch a plan to reunite their parents by switching places. The problem is their father has met someone.Hilarity ensues through the film as these two charming girls make mischief. The cast delivers an amazing performance. Lindsay Lohan does an excellent job in her debut role.No film, however, goes without its flaws. This film had very little of those. The only people who would notice them are fans of the older film. The problem is, when you break it down, the film is a modernized version of the 1961 film, with a new cast. The film doesn't introduce a lot of new plot turns. There is a tidbit here, and there, that is different from the original. But all it truly is, is an updated version.Still young Lohans charm, Dennis quads superb acting, and the talents of the rest of the cast earn this film ti's A+.9 out of 10</fullReview>

The parents, played by Natasha Richardson and Dennis Quaid, were also very amazing, but Natasha Richardson really stole the show. As Elizabeth James, Natasha played the mother role picture perfect, and it's a surprise since she is used to more serious roles, but she was the perfect wonderful mother in this movie. Lisa Ann Walters also displayed some great personality as the nanny to Hallie, and Simon Kunz added some very funny moments as the butler to Elizabeth and Annie James.

I don't know why either but when the girls declare they are going to switch each other again in terms that the mother and the father all go on a camping trip and the camera zooms out behind the girls while the father looks at each one, the girl on the left has a very different hair color then either one of them. And the whole poker thing when the two girls are playing in the very beginning shouldn't be that easy. One of them gets straight in diamonds then other one gets a perfect hand too.

Natasha Richardson is very direct in her role as Elizabeth James, their mother. Elaine Hendrix seems like she researched people to find a snobby gold digger and a make-up artist who can apply way to much to make her seem like a fag, because she had that part nailed.

		<fullReview>We just happened upon this film on the TV and found it hugely enjoyable. It's what one might expect from the synopses but very well executed. Really good performances and the movie captures a warm, romantic spirit.The central and supporting performances are all strong and the cast are all completely in tune with the movie's style - a style that we can trace back to the 1930's - but which probably flourished in the 60's &amp; 70's live-action Disney productions. Why this movie gets a PG rating is beyond me, other than some clearly "fantasy" pranks and a little, very mild adult references (over the heads of any child who doesn't already know).You will laugh and maybe even have a damp eye occasionally. Well crafted family entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very romantic, witty, hilarious, and touching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, THE PARENT TRAP is a very romantic, witty, hilarious, and touching movie. The one person I really hated was Meredith (Elaine Hendrix). This was because she was an absolute witch who wanted Nick (Dennis Quaid) all to herself! Plus, she threatened to ship the twins (Lindsay Lohan) off to Switzerland. Also, I believe that the twins gave Meredith what she deserved on the camping trip. When Meredith got called "Cruella DeVil," I thought she deserved it. I laughed really hard when she said, "Who do you think I'm talking to? Robert De Niro? Yes, I'm talking to you." My favorite part, though, was when Nick, Meredith, and the twins were on the camping trip, which was where Meredith got some tricks pulled on her. That was absolutely hilarious! In conclusion, I highly recommend this film to all of you who are fans of Dennis Quaid or like a good romance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Families movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a delight to watch The Parent Trap, my whole family enjoyed it. Lindsay Lohans acting was top notch along with a great cast it is the perfect movie. The whole Camp scene was good especially when they started to know each other they finally became friends. The whole Plot is a classic but this has a special kind of spin to it. The Comdedic parts of the movie were hilarious, we literally jumped off the couch laughing. Near the end of the movie we were all captured in the moment. The Drama was eye catchy because the drama was always like a cat fight like when Hallie(Annie) was mouthing with Meridith. You can never get bored of Parent trap because its so adorable and good 10/10 TPT can always bring a smile to your face</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Girl Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every seat for "Parent Trap" was full--with 100% girls of all ages. Even more than with the recent "Romeo and Juliet," and younger. I couldn't remember being in a theater like that since I first saw "Hard Days Night." It's a bit much that the parents are idyllically rich, but I liked Richardson's nervousness and reluctance to see and get back with Quaid, with fun jokes about his being a hunk with a killer smile--even if of course you know how it's going to end.Lohan is absolutely amazing, though I'm sure I did catch a couple of continuity problems between one and the other twin.Much as I like Lisa Walters (she had a fun TV show last season), that part would have made more sense with an older woman as the nanny.

		<shortDescription>the incredible Lindsey Lohan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is almost perfect Disney.Heartwarming and enjoyable. Innocent and full of good feeling.Like they used to make them but don't anymore.It is well directed in Disney style and all the actors are good in it, but of course it's a Lindsey Lohan star performance.She absolutely shines in this one.The twin trick is technically done very well but one expects it these days.Its in her performance that the twins really come alive.She makes each one a separate person with clear differences and also manages an enjoyable British accent. I own it on disc and have seen it so many times,more than i've seen much more famous and "bigger" movies. I believe anyone who likes Disney will love this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The reason I loved this movie is its so natural and forthright!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really loved this movie! It was both hilarious and groovy! I was surprised that the twins looks so much alike! I didn't know about the split-images technology used! It was cool! One would never tell! To think that both parents decided to send the girls to the same camp, it shows that deep inside them the hold the same traits and qualities. It was a pity they had to split, but I guess they needed the time apart to grow as individuals. They were able to do that and were successful in their specif fields! That was very good! The story line and the characters are fantastic! Dennis is good and so is Natasha! and the happy ending was an icing to the cake! The tricks they played on their father's fiancée were rib-cracking! I've never laughed so much in a long time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a nice movie. Lindsay Lohan is looking so cute and appropriate as the adorable twins that you begin to cry at one scene when Hallie's nanny recognizes "Hally" to be actually "Anne". Dennis Quaid is good, but obviously he is shaded by Lohan. The Disney touch has given the simple story a very sensible yet funny look. The scene when the two understand they are siblings was really enacted so touchily that I had to check my tears. The role of Elaine Hendrix was needed only to show the most precious-ness of the daughters to their Dad. the language of the film was decent. And the best part was the attitude contrasts of Anne and Hallie played by Lohan. The song "Here She Goes" is so appropriate on her....! I can go on describing all the scene that had touched me but that will make you know all the suspenses. I recommend to see this movie to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hallie is from California, and Annie is from England. When the two meet at summer camp they realise that they have nothing in common, except they are identical twins! So they decide to switch places, and get their parents back together. They do all they can to get their parents back together, surprise meetings, candle-lit dinners, camping trips, the rest is down to fate. But will it it work, or are Hallie and Annie just to late? This is my favourite movie ever, Lindsay plays Hallie and Annie brilliantly, and Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson are also great at playing the parents! I give this movie ten out of ten, the music is brilliant, as is the locations, and as I already said, the actors are great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Parent Trap is a great movie for children. It is funny, wholesome, and I'd have to say that it is Lindsay Lohan's best performance.If you like the Lizzie Maguire Movie and What a Girl Wants you will surely like The Parent Trap.Parents if you are looking for a movie that you can let your kids watch with out worrying, then The Parent Trap is the movie for you.So there you have it; a great movie for kids, Lindsay Lohan's unusual ability to fence, and throw in Dennis Quaid. What do you have to lose.I hope you have found this comment useful!!!!Thanx, Sheenultralord</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the characters i like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though it is a little bit incredible ,it is a good life story .For I am a optimistic person ,i like a story with happy ending .Annie and Hallie are the most successful actresses in this film .i viewed that they are real twins at the beginning until others told me that they was acted by the same person .she is so lovely and well done on performing two different characters. One is a gentle girl with good education but lives without father ,another is a spicy girl ,crude and always comes up with strange ideas .both of them are excellent ,however I still prefer they are two ,for that will be more perfect I admire her for her skillful act as a little girl, you know not everyone could do that.Although Elizabeth and Nick are the main actress and actor in the film ,they perform less ,but no doubt excellent .compare to them ,i think Martin and Chessy is a funny pair .at the beginning Martin gave me an impression as a gentleman ,a good butler always in uniform ,especially when he dance with Hallie .until Elizabeth want to visit Nick in Napa valley, California , he was in a dress like a viking ,that really surprise us and made everyone laughing .when he first saw Chessy who is the housemaid of Nick .same temper and character hold them together ,they even forgot their host .it seems according to someone's saying --love arrange everything.a good film constructed buy many factors ,but the most attractive part is the characters, for it could easily gave people deep impression but not the sets or any thing else .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what I learn from parent trap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main characters of the story are Hallie and Annie.They are twins,but their parent get divorce.They meet at the summer camp,and soon discover that they are sisters.The whole story tells us how the twins get their parents back together .The story shows us the bad side of the life.In the recent years,the divorce rate is getting higher and higher.I know that do a little good to both sides of the couples,but children suffered quilt a lot .Take Hallia and Annie for example,if they do not meet at the summer camp ,what their life will be ? do they live a happy life ? Let us just imagine.Annie does not know who is her father ,and what her father looks like .There is not father telling her stories at night in order t0 help her falling asleep.There is not father helping her when she meets problems in life .There is not father playing basketball with her on the weekend .She may suffered from classmates' strange looks. Will she tears when seeing fathers sending their children to school .I think she will. And I believe Hallie even suffered more from no mother .For the twins , living in the single family is the best time in their life ,because both of them are missing the parents so much.Divorce ,in my opinion ,is not a good thing .Do not get divorce . .</fullReview>

I have been expecting to have an opportunity to participate in summer camp , hope and there to very amazing thing happens too by oneself very much all the time . So she meeting she pairs of afterbirth sistering normal thinging very in there can miraculously. It is really a miracle .While seeing they take off the mask and see mutual face, I am very excited for them. Annaie James training is admired by people very much at this moment. She annotates the characteristic of a standard British little girl thoroughly.Courteous and overcautious, and there are principles. Her talent and wisdom let people exclaim. This role performing that she clears up lets people enjoy endless aftertastes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Parent Trap is a funny and wonderful film , I love it very much .It has the same name about 11-year-old twins, separated at birth when their parents divorce, who meet again at summer camp. The parents are Nick parker , who now lives with Hallie at his vineyard in Napa , California , and Elizabeth James , who makes her home with Annie in London . The twins , played by the excellent and talented Lindsay Lohan who is a clever girl play two different roles , each return to the parent they are never known , with a plan to reveal the switch and help the parents reunite when the twins are restored to their custodial parent . Unfortunately , something unlucky happened during the eight weeks of camp , he is fallen in love and plans to marry the younger woman Meredith Blake who just wants his money and rude to his daughter . The twins spring into action , and the London twin brings Elizabeth to San Francisco . The twins create a romantic dinner-a-deux for the pair , with the help of the California nanny Chessy and the London butler Martin . the results aren??t quite as expected , but as we suspect all along , things work out as should . but finally Nick still chooses his ex-wife with the twins?? help and the family is compound again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike most of the American films, the ?°Parent Trap?±is a film about the love between family members.The story it tells about is common,but what it shows us are unusual----The movie itself tells the story very well.There is a saying in China:?±The touch lies in the little details.?± So it is.The directo r knows people&amp;acute;s world inside very well,he got it and used it in the movie successfully------That makes people follow what is doing on just by several actors (actress) and several little details. The movie itself put something in the words,then we watch ,and we are touched at last by nature.I regard this movie as one of the movies which touch me deeply. For its prosaic details but unusual meanings.Life lies in the words, love lies in the words, and the most important thing is family for a child.The movie tells me those things. Furthermore, those things make it become a good and touched movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something touch me in Parent Trap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Parent Trap what I have seen twice touches me all the time. Especially some parts of them. At the beginning of the film, the twins look like enemies. That is what we don??t expect. But I believe that whatever they do will not hurt each other really. Except for DNA authentication, I think that is the best example that explains why they are twins. They not only look the same and eccentric taste is the same but also temperament is the same as well. Thinks to those mess things they made, they have the chance to live together.?°One ?­two?­three!?± The tow torn photos, when placed next to each other, fit perfectly, forming one complete photo. Annie??s Mon sits next to Hallie??s Dad. ?°That??s my Dad.?± ?°That is my Mon.?± I don??t know why this part makes me tears. But who knows? Stand in their places. If you meet your father or your mother whom you have never seen before, what can you do? Cry? Yes, most of us choose crying and we can tell him/ her how much we love him/her. But they can??t. They just switch places. Nick will get married a creepy but beautiful woman who is only after his money. For the hoping of the whole family, something they do make me laugh and the girls?? affection touch me at the same time. Their Mon also stands up for her love. For that and for her children, I think it is a good determination to lay some reasons that make them break up aside. She has set a good example for others, hasn??t she? When the Annie??s grandfather knows the fact, the relationship set up between Hallie and him is pure. Do you think it is rare in the world that a relationship is without generation gap? No matter what, the end is acceptable. But the parts what touch me will keep in my memory for a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you ask me which child-star I like best, I will tell you immediately without thinking that is Lindsay Lohan! Maybe you are not so familiar with her name, but if I introduce more, you will say, oh, that's it! Lohan is the actress of the movie Parent Trap!The editor must be very intelligent, for he picked up an excellent girl from thousands of children, Lohan came from Long Island, and at that time she was only 11. When others at the same age was still ignorant, she had already act in a film successfully. I didn't believe she played dual roles until the end of the movie. It was amazing and unbelievable that a 11 years-old girl could do so. She was clever, beautiful, competent and vivid, and attracted every audience deeply.Many years pass, Lohan must be a charming lady now. We still like her and look forward to seeing her good performance in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my view about parent trap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the first time I saw the film, I was deeply touched by the naught and lovely twins, Especially the first time they were met at the school. It is very interesting, then I was touched by the content of the film, I think the love Is very important In our life, whenever you are, wherever you live, no matter what the situations we face, love is always in there, in our heart, it not changed by the environment we are, the true love is not change, it is can make us feel great no matter what the mood we are in,The film gave me a good lesson about love after I saw it, the love about parents, the love between family members, from the film we can seen that the time has make the family apart, they live far away from each other, but what makes the family reunion, I think all the people can know the reason, it is about love, because they love each other very much, although they are apart along time, but the heart get close each other, the good end of this film can tell us above.The true love is not changed by other peoples, in the film, the Meredith want to marry Nick because his property, but endless, so I think money can make many things come true, we can many things we want, when it comes to love, money can not make love come true forever, I think this film is a good example about life, so we should love each other in the family and cherish the relationships we made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>love me, love my parents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is a comedy. It happens at a summer camp in Maine, USA. two young girls Annie and Hallie. They look pretty similar. When they get along with each other, they know they are twins. Annie lives with mother (Elizabeth) and Hallie lives with father (Nick). They decide to switch sides. All works well, until their father decides to marry another woman who is beautiful but covets riches. So the girls decide to make their parents reunite and let their dream come true. As for me, the moving scene is Hallie tell her mother the truth that she is not Annie. She is Hallie. At that time Hallie is very contradictory in her heart. And she worries about her mother does not love her as love as Annie. Before she tells the truth, she must think a lot. No one knows how strong feelings are there in her heart. She desires for having a complete family, which have father, mother, sister and she. She doesn??t want to switch again. Fortunately, the girls don??t surrender to the life. Through their optimism and intelligence, they make the things according to their plans. Although no everything is bon voyage, they never give up. In their heart they know a complete family are their wishes for.I think it is their hard working to touch the God and let their dream come true. But it??s very important that their parents still love each other. Because of a small mistake they separated. Sometimes we need not too opinionated in life. Life looks like a box of chocolate, you don??t know what you??re going to get. Holding on whatever you have and cherish many valuable things in your hands.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, the movie ?°Parent Trap?± is an impressed, touched and humorous movie. Common and humorous are the most obvious difference with some stately and boring super film. Different people could get different ideas about it. It??s main idea is two young twins lives in a separated family, when they found the truth, they decided to know more about their ex-parents, so they switch their identification, and help their parent recover at last. It is so common a story that you need not devote any energy to digest its contents. Generally speaking, it makes us know the importance of a whole family to their own members. As an adult, when you get remarry or divorce, you should care for the feeling of your selves and children, because they are the most powerless and innocent benefitor and victim, who will be affected by your choice directly. A happy and consolidated family is a vital treasure to the cultivate of children. To me, the most expressed occasion is the wife told her ex-husband that she would have come back to him, if he caught up with her on the occasion of their first broke up, it is a pity that the man lost the chance to recover with his beloved wife, so he will not lost it any more. In our daily life, we will meet so much choice, but majority of them were missed because we daren??t to purse them or accept those challenges. As everyone known, something won??t come back once missing. When you came across someone, please cherish your chance and take action as soon as possible.In a word, if you could learn something from it, it is a good movie.??Î÷?¤?§Ô?ÍâÓ??µ021°??­?Î</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>prim Annie and cool Hallie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fun family movie, with lots of romance, great scenery in San Francisco, London, and the Napa Valley, and a story that grabs at the heart strings. The "Parent Trap" features a young unknown girl(Lindsay Lohan) playing both twins -- prim Annie from London and cool Hallie from Napa. Twin sisters, Hallie and Annie, are separated at birth by a divorce. Ten years later they meet at camp, not knowing they are related. But the discovery soon happens, and now their goal is to bring their mother and father back together. So they agree to switch places, and go home to meet the "other" parent. However, a crisis looms when Annie discovers her father has a fiancée and the impending marriage is just two weeks away.Linday Lohan is quite excellent at acting with herself. Her emotions are quite realistic and unrestrained. She is really a lovely girl,she can speak English, she can speak French, she can play cards and she can fencing?­?­Oh, she know so many things! We can't imagine that she is just a 11-year-old girl. When she act as Hallie, she is really a clever child, we don??t know that what she will do next. When she act as Annie, she is really a grace lady, like a priness, and has a grace temperament. And she??s thought is clear, to solve problem more suitable.In a word, Linday Lohan, a good actress, I really love this beautiful, lovely, grace, clever girl.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen the movie in the movie channel on TV when I was in the middle school but just a part of it. I thought the movie is very interesting. I had a chance to see the movie again. My teacher shown it to us in class.The Parent Trap is a good movie. I like it very much. Hallie and Annie met and discovered they are long-lost twins at a camp. The parents divorced and separated them after they were born. They planed to bring the parents back together and the succeeded at last. In fact, a whole family is important to the growing of children. But Hallie and Annie both are optimistic.Lindsay Lohan plays two different characters in the movie. She did it very well. She began her career at age three as a Ford model, and also made appearances in over sixty television commercials. I also like her another movie, Freaky Friday. She also did a good job.Looking forward to her better performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say Parent Trap is really a good film .It??s an interesting story about two young red heads .They are not only beautiful but also very clever .Their parents divorced many years ago .When they got the truth ,they try their best to get them back together .Facing to Meredith ,a beautiful but creepy woman ,they struggled with her instead of giving up by their little clever heads .At last ,they won ! Maybe many people believe that Parent Trap is a common story and not special at all .In my opinion ,it??s better than some movies today which are boring ,violent ,blue like dirty rubbish .The two little girls who have childish ,pure ,and kind hearts is the type we lack today .It makes you laugh and relax .When you are upset ,when you are tired ,it??s a good choice ,is not it ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dog's nose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After I saw the movie Parent Trap, some ideas came upon me. The more I thought about it, the more excited I felt. Now I can??t help sharing the wonderful ideas with you, my friends. The story is like this: Annie arrived at the Victorian-style ranch house with her father??s accompanying. The housemaid. Chessy came out. She was very happy to see Hallie back, but they including Hallie's father, Nick didn??t recognize that the girl wasn't Hallie. However, when Annie said hit to the dog, Sammy, she didn??t receive Sammy??s enthusiasm. On the contrary, Sammy sniffed at her shoes and barked at her. Even though Chessy felt a little strange, she paid no more attention to it latter.I couldn't understand why people couldn't recognize someone who live close with one another for a long time but the dog could. Thinking about if for a long time, I finally realized that there are two reasons. One is that the dog has an agile nose but people not. It is just dog's instinct. That??s why we can not reproach those people. The other is that some people lack some abilities of insight and analysis. They can??t realize and deal with some things correctly so that they may be making some silly mistakes. It shows that we can't judge people by their appearance.From the film, I learn that we should come to a conclusion after investigating and analyzing the matter carefully and intellectually, and should not be blinded by some superficial phenomena.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been watched the movie ?°Parent Trap?± when I was a senior in high school. Now I am the junior in the college. I watched it again in my movie course. What an excited thing that I can enjoy it again! I still remember some excellent incidents of this movie. It can see how charming the movie it is! In my memory, the movie made my mother (my mum also watched it) and I felt very funny and happy 3 years ago Also, the two little girls in the movie Annie and Hallie are so lovely and nice. Now, I watched it again and found something that I did not know and realize before. For example, from the two girl??s parents I know that don't be so stubborn in something , don??t hesitate and chase it immediately when you think you are right ,know how important catch the opportunity quickly. I know, courage, hope, smart and brave spirits are the factors of success through the two little girls'actions.I must mention the little actress??Lindsay Morgan. She is so nice and smart. As a little girl, it's difficult to play two different characters in one movie. But she did it and did it very well. She brought funny and laugh to us. I think most of us who watched this movie will like her and gave her good comments. It??s a pity that I only know her one movie. I hope she do better and better in her career life.At last, I would like to thank Mr Chen who is my teacher of English movie course. Watching movie is a good way to improve our spoken English and listening skills. Hope ?°Hallie and Annie?±, hope Lindsay, hope everyone goes well.</fullReview>

Then their common history opens up when they are banned into the isolation cabin for unsociable behavior. They discovered they are long-lost twins .Being twin sisters, their parent separated them at birth and divorced. Now the twins they devise a plan to bring their divorced parents back together, and have the family they have always wished for.I love the way this Movie shows how important a child Parents are. The story has the good judgment to focus more on the relationship than the gimmicks of the impersonations. The Parent Trap is a delightful joy to watch from beginning to end. All in all a must see family movie, perfect for anybody. This movie lets me understand, thousands separate even if the distance, but the kindred will not disappear or cut off. Perhaps this is that blood is thicker than water. If you like Disney movies or family movies of any kind, this is a wonderful to see!</fullReview>

More importantly, over 100 of my students have watched this great movie in class and I have asked them to role-play the twin sister as part of the final examination this semester.They will also learned to write movie comments/reviews on www.IMDb.com and share with other people from all over the world their views on Parent Trap.

		<fullReview>In her first role as a complete star, I think Lohan executed the part of both Annie and Hallie tremendously. I'm not going to go into mega detail on the plot etc, but I just wanted to say to the critics that think twins should have been hired - Lohan was awesome at playing both sisters, she showed maturity beyond her years, and it is not easy to work in a way that you basically have to talk to yourself! Not only does she work in two roles, she gets into each character superbly, and even does a believable English accent (although as a English girl I have to say it annoys me how English people are always portrayed as posh in US-made films..trust me we aren't all like that!). I think everyone should give Lindsay Lohan the credit she deserves!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi! Hello! My name is RHEG(pronounce as REJ). I am a Philippine, male 14yrs old fan of Lindsay Lohan. since 1998.By the way, I first watched this movie just a month ago because it was showed on the television. I didn't make it to watch it in cinema. This movie is really great even though others say that the original movie is better. The officials behind this are really cool. They made it to appear that hallie and Annie are 2 different people. I liked Annie more than Hallie coz i really liked the british accent. But is Hallie is also cool. Honestly, Lindsay Lohan is a very very very beautiful and cute girl. I really liked her. I love her beautiful red hair and her adorable blue eyes. I also liked her cute freckles. We were almost in the same age when I saw this movie because the movie was shot 1998, I watched only this year 2004. She was 11 or 12 years old and I am 14. To tell you the truth, I really have a crush on her or should I say I love her, but it is only in my dreams because an ordinary boy like me doesn't have a chance on her. Another is, today Lindsay is already 16 or 17. Anyway, all that I can say is Lindsay and this movie are both great. That's why I bought a VHS tape of the parent trap-1998 so I can always be in touch with her.</fullReview>

I'm real glad that someone out there had the same idea! I think Lindsey Lohan expertly balanced her characters; one, being a street-wise Californian Pree-teen, the other, a sophisticated, English rose. in fact, her performance was so flawless, friends don't believe me when i tell them that the "twins" from The Parent Trap, are actually one and the same person! Aside from that, Natasha Richardson definitely contributes to the film, in that scatty, quirky way of hers. Do yourself a favour, give this film an hour and a half of your time;I think it's well worth it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why? Because while the remake throws back to the original, with some of the same lines and scenes, (the cabin prank, the hiking trip) it manages to distance itself enough that it is its own movie. For instance, the poker scene at the camp. Granted, some of the new stuff was hokey (the elaborate handshake) or sickeningly cute (the butler and the nanny storyline, which i actually do find entertaining), it is still very well done. Lindsay Lohan does as well as Haylie Mills in the original, and I actually like Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson better as the parents. And I really like the added touch of bringing back Joanna Barnes, who played Vicky the fiancee in the original, as future-mother-in-law Vicky. It was definitely unexpected (for me, at least) and I enjoyed that. Overall, this is as good as the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Summer camp, Maine, 1998. Two girls meet at a competition and one defeats the other. Later both of them are confined in a isolation cabin due to their anti-social behaviour. Then they realise they are actually identical twins- Hallie Parker (Lindsay Lohan) lives with her father, Nick (Dennis Quaid) in Napa Valley, California and Annie James (also Lindsay Lohan) lives with her mother (Natasha Richardson) in London, England. They have never met their mum/dad because they were seperated when their parents divorced and they have never been told the truth. The girls decide to switch identities in order to meet their parents, only to find out later that their father, Nick, is about to marry a money-sucker named Meredith (Elaine Hendrix). Now they have a master plan, which is to get their parents reunited...Overall, this flick is entertaining, though it's typical Disney with many unrealistic elements. A fairy tale, basically. But it's fun. Lindsay Lohan is capable, brilliant and definitely on the way to auspicious stardom. The film is not recommended to sophisticated thinking adults, though. 7/10</fullReview>

I'm not looking for deep, meaningful, insightful films, though sometimes Disney does provide them. I take my children to Disney films because they are fun and entertaining, and that is exactly what the Parent Trap is, a fun and entertaining family movie. I especially enjoyed the fact that they had the woman who played Vickie in the original movie play Meredith's mother, and her paraphrasing the "Hello pet, you may call me Aunt Vickie," was classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best family movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have only had the movie for a few weeks, but have watched it several times. Each time I find something new to wonder at. Lindsay portrays the American and English girl with such aplomb. She enters into the parts so naturally that you believe that she really is the particular girl she is portraying at the time, and not merely acting a part. Each of the other actors add to the greatness of this movie. My grandchildren (aged 4 - 8) have watched it four times in a week, they enjoy it so much. Occasionally some of the lines Lindsay has to say are a bit corny, but nothing can detract from her use of eyes, physical actions, and facial expressions, such as when Hallie gets into the car to return to America, and Annie is in the car returning home. Her American reaction when seeing her mother for the first time was so natural, as was her English reaction when meeting Dad - the way she stopped and waited to be invited into his arms was really inspired. Even though Lindsay is both girls, she portrays the parts as two different girls. A great movie, worth 11/10.</fullReview>

They are completely faithful to the premise and basic concept of the story. However, they are not slaves to it when it comes to details. Disney has very smoothly updated the story and they've made it a winner in its own right. And look for the cameo by the actress who played the evil gold-digger in the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. It was a beautiful remake to a classic original. I disagree with a comment made by someone earlier. They said that the strip poker game and gambling should have been cut out. First of all, it wasn't strip poker except for the last hand and they were going into seventh grade. I am about her age and I still remember that in seventh grade those things happen. I love the ending. It was new and fresh. I even believe that because of the way they ended it that they could have a part two. The only thing I want to know was if she was nude for the scene right after the poker game or if she had a flesh-colored bathing suit on. Someone let me know if you know. If it was a bathing suit then it must have been a strapless one because you see her shoulders at that point. Anyway, EXCELLENT MOVIE!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Romantic, funny, clever, and wonderful casting. Who wouldn't fall in love with Dennis Quaid in this movie? I'm the same age as Haley Mills who played the twins in the original movie and do believe I prefer this version! Miss Lothan is a "find" and I hope she can continue in an adult career... Good all around fun, and highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good family entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can think of only a few films that can kids enjoy that won't bore intelligent adults and vice versa. This film is a pleasant exception. Director Nancy Meyers, was right on spot, and took an older film and made it better than the original, a bit unusual. The cast was excellent. Lidsay Lohan, who played the role of the twins, was cute without being grating, while Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson had wonderful chemistry with each other, as well as with Lohan. The strong point of this film was the fine acting by the entire cast. I'll give it a solid *10*, because family films are rare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very good Movie and I think 11 year old Lindsay Lohan, a professional actor who played both Hallie and Annie, spanned the gap between screen and audience and made me fell like I was there. I love the way this Movie treats children with respect.Remember how Annie had the shivers when she saw Hallie's photo of her dad's back?

		<fullReview>I don't like very old movies (1950-1970) they are just too primitive and the picture quality is too bad. This movie is based on a very old version so I don't really care about the original. This new version looks really good. There are no slow parts in the story so it's just 2 full hours of fun. I did not even notice that the 2 girls are actually played by one. I have seen this movie many times and the technique is just amazing, the lighting and eye-lines are always correct when the 2 girls are in the same frame.This movie also contains one of the most perfect special effects: the animal that crawls from the top of "Mer's" head into her mouth. Finally a computer-effect that is 100% useful and really funny.If you want to watch a good movie ...then go and see this one !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best movie Disney has ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Parent Trap is a great movie full of action, romance and comedy, as you would expect. It is a story about two separated twin-girls, Annie James and Hallie Parker each one living with one of their parents. They meet up in a camp in Maine and prepare a great trap for their parents, which are divorced for 11 years. Lindsay Lohan plays the two girls, Natasha Richardson plays their mother, Elisabeth James, and Dennis Quaid, their father, Nick Parker. Also starring Elain Hendrix as Meredith Balke and Lisa Ann Walter as Chessy. Probably the best movie Disney has ever made The Parent Trap is filmed in lots of diferent locations, providing a great deal of difference. It starts in Maine, Camp Walden, goes on to London, Napa and San Francisco and finishes in London. Nancy Meyers has showed us that it can do a great deal. I advise you all to buy or rent this film because it will be the best movie you'll ever see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, THE PARENT TRAP is a VERY romantic, witty, hilarious, and touching movie. The one person I REALLY hated was Meredith (Elaine Hendrix). This was because she was an absolute which and wanted Nick (Dennis Quaid) all to herself! Plus, she threatened to ship the twins (Lindsay Lohan) off to Switzerland. Also, I believe that the twins gave Meredith what she deserved on the camping trip. When Meredith got called "Cruella DeVil," I think she deserved it. In addition, when she said, "Who do you think I'm talking to? Robert De Niro? Yes, I'm talking to you," I laughed REALLY hard. My favorite part was when Nick, Meredith and the twins are on the camping trip and Meredith got the tricks pulled on her. That was absolutely hilarious! In conclusion, I HIGHLY recommend this film to all of you who are fans of Dennis Quaid or like a good romance.</fullReview>

It is a funny movie about identical twins who are separated as babies, and don't know about each other until they meet at a camp by coinsidence. They start out fighting then they find out that they are twins, and they try to get their parents back together. This movie is both funny and emotional. A must see movie. I recommend seeing the 1961 version first, but if you haven't seen this movie rent it or buy it. It will be worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen the original all the way through once, and partway twice. This version is very delightful. First of all, outstanding job Lindsay Lohan (Hallie Parker and Annie James). Playing two different characters that are quite different in personality is a difficult task for a child actor. All of the acting was very good. Dennis Quaid (Nick Parker), Natasha Richardson (Elizabeth James), and Elaine Hendrix (Meredith Blake) are outstanding. But, of course, Lindsay Lohan as well as Lisa Ann Walter (Chessy, Nick's housekeeper), and Simon Kunz (Martin the butler) really steal the show.**************spoiler alert****************The plot was outstanding. I wondered throughout the movie whether the parents were going to get back together (I could not remember the outcome of the original). This version kept me guessing right up till the very end. When I thought there was no hope and Annie and Elizabeth were leaving at the end I thought "what a horrible ending." But then when they arrived back in England and Hallie and Nick were waiting on them, now that was awesome. There were some very funny sequences in the movie too. There were a few questionable scenes. I wish the strip poker and the gambling could have been left out. But otherwise the movie was quite clean, especially since there were many opportunities for sexual, adult content.</fullReview>

My wife &amp; I loved it when we saw it on a date, and my kids (both under age 7) think it's hilarious.Kudos to Lindsay Lohan and the special effects folks for making us forget that only one girl is playing both twin parts, a vast improvement over the original with Hayley Mills. Also to Lisa Ann Walter and Simon Kunz for scene-stealing performances as Chessy &amp; Martin, the two girls' nanny &amp; butler.Keep your eyes &amp; ears open for a few sly references to the original 1961 "Parent Trap."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of the original, I went to see this movie expecting to be disappointed. Turns out that I love it almost as much as the original. Disney did a great job in this remarkable remake. The characters, especially the parents, are much more 3 dimensional. Disney managed to modernize the movie while still keeping true to the old favorite.I love the quick one-liners which remind you that this movie is a remake, especially the cameo by Joanna Barnes, and the reference to Rev. Mosby.Lindsay Lohan did an excellent, excellent job of recreating the role of the twins separated at birth. Her acting skills alone make this a movie worth seeing, even if you weren't a fan of the first. And kudos to Disney for staying true with the "one girl plays two characters" theory, rather than hiring say the Olsen twins to play this part.All in all, I could watch this one back to back. A bit shorter than the original, but still the best remake I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thanks to my 15-year-old daughter for forcing me to watch this! It's now my favorite movie of all time. I can't get enough of it! It's SO much better than the Hayley Mills version - after seeing this great remake, Mills now comes across to me as shrill and phony. Lindsay Lohan is much more natural and certainly convincing as the twins. The relationship between the parents is more real, too. Funny that the running length for both versions is the same; this one seems to move much faster. Anyway, if you're a hopeless romantic, as I am, this movie is a MUST!</fullReview>

I found the movie had a great up-to-date look, and was very warm and inviting. Acting by Natasha Richardson and Dennis Quaid was also good, as were the supporting characters like Elaine Hendrix.If you know both versions well, see them both.

		<fullReview>Lindsay Lohan stole my breath away as Hallie and Annie Parker. Working with such a clever plot, Lohan has almost single handidly pulled off one of the best performances of 1998. Also, what a breath a fresh air to Hollywood as she explodes on the scene as one of the best child actresses I've seen in a long time. The proof is a movie called "The Parent Trap.""The Parent Trap" also stars Dennis Quaid as one of the best actors I've seen because he is so versatile if he is in a drama, action, or family film. I have since seen him in "Frequency," which is my favorite movie of all time."The Parent Trap" is a light hearted film that will allow the mind to flow freely while sitting and relaxing. In addition, the movie was not only clever, but original because Lohan pulled off her role as she knew what she was doing without having to be told what to do. Lohan is a natural talent that should be treasured because she is so good and seen in more films The supporting cast also fit, which made it that much more enjoyable to watch. Good cast choices all the way around. I suggest that everyone see this film because it is really good clean fun with one of the brightest and youngest stars to hit Hollywood. Bravo to the cast and crew of "The Parent Trap."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't think this movie could be as good as the original, but I guess I should have known better! Lindsay Lohan is excellent and very lovable, and all I can say is . . . we better be seeing her in other movies!!! She better not be one of those child stars who you see once and then fades out. She's too good for Hollywood to let that happen. I liked both Annie and Hallie at once, even though they were snotty to each other in the beginning, but for some reason that made me like them more. I guess it showed their high-spiritedness, which is good to see in adolescent girls. (And of course, I knew they'd become friends soon enough.) I loved Dennis Quaid as their father; I hadn't seen him in any role where he has the warm father/friend image. I thought Meredith was more suitable for her character than Vicki (her counterpart from the original). She was funnier and seemed more like "the wicked stepmother-to-be." Also I liked the scenes of London and Napa Valley that we got to see in this one. The filming was excellent. I thought the ending made more sense too and was more complete. The original has the "Disney classic" aspect about it (it was made when Walt was still alive) and should definitely not be overshadowed but the new one was easier to relate to (since it takes place today, obviously). I can't really pick one over the other. Their differences have to do with the time periods, of course, so I think it's best to just leave it at that and not try to analyze which is better. They exist well in harmony. Oh yeah, and I loved the music too -- I bought the soundtrack after seeing it only once.</fullReview>

My wife and I wanted to watch something kind of simple and fun, rather than yet another action movie or yet another stupid comedy; so, we asked the video salesperson for a recommendation and this movie was tops on the list. I have to say, the movie is absolutely wonderful. Both of us loved it, especially since we both recognized Lindsay Lohan from a soap we both used to watch: i.e Another World. Lindsay was incredible for the short time she was on Another World and she is doubly incredible in this movie. I very rarely tear up when watching a movie, but this movie had a few scenes where my eyes watered up. I went out and bought the video the next day and have since watched the movie at least 3 more times.

It is a nice movie about 2 11 year old girls who meet at a summer camp and find out that they are twins who were split up when they were babies. They decided to change places when they went home, so they can each meet their other parent. They also decided to try to get their parents back together. To see if they did or not, watch the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A charming remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read a few comments from movie critics and needed to add some comments about this movie.I'm a single male and Disney movies are not my usual fare. I happened accross this movie one night (very late) and was instantly charmed by Lindsay Lohan the young actress. This movie will not overtake "The Wizard of Oz" as one of the top family films of all time, but it is definitely a worthy entry.Every one in the family, young or old, will find it captivating, charming and it will touch your heart. Critics always find things about movies to denigrate.Well I suppose you could say that here too. The underlying story about a couple that divorces shortly after the birth of twins and each parent takes a twin and goes their separate way without subsequent contact, may be a little stretched but so what. The movie develops an unlikely original premise. What movie doesn't??? (other than documentaries!)Don't read any criticism of this movie without seeing it yourself! Any person not touched and enthralled with this one has no soul to be touched!I don't want to give too much more away...See it!! Love it!!! you'll be thrilled that you did! and so will everyone you saw it with!!</fullReview>

Now I've seen the movie a multitude of times. I just can't say enough about this movie!A job well done by all the people at the Disney studios, the writers and of coarse the cast. Especially Lindsay Lohan, who did an excellent and convincing job of her "double role". I laughed, cried and thoroughly enjoyed myself. It just doesn't get any better than this!I've seen the original and I appreciated it as a cute Disney classic, but the 1998 version just floored it! Great Job!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful re-make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with other critics, I have a special place in my heart for the original movie with Hayley Mills. However, this is a re-make that really works. It has been updated for the 90s very well, while still being a very sweet picture. Lindsay Lohan is what makes it work so well, with others very well cast. Of course, the original snag in credibility still holds: what parents in their right minds would just walk away with one baby apiece and never want to see the other one? But if we suspend disbelief, as we must do at times anyway, this is an enjoyable movie. To her credit, Lindsay does better with switching accents than Hayley did (although Hayley was so lovable that we were willing to overlook that). Check out Simon Kunz, who plays Martin, in "Four Weddings and a Funeral"--completely different character, this guy is great. I think this one is on its way to becoming one of the comfort movies that I watch when I'm feeling bad. Even my 17-year-old son liked it. My husband loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney's remake of The Parent Trap is absolutely fantastic. Lindsay Lohan is outstanding in the dual roles of Annie James and Hallie Parker. While she carries the bulk of the film, she is supported by an outstanding cast. Natasha Richardson is great as the beautiful, sophisticated English working woman. Dennis Quaid brings a lot to the ruggedly handsome American father role. Simon Kunz and Lisa Ann Walter add a touch of humor in their roles as Annie and Hallie's butler/nanny, respectively. Fantastic direction. Also, the soundtrack for this film fits the movie better than any I've seen in a while. * * * *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Parent Trap (1998) is a great all around movie for both children and adults. Lindsay Lohan played a huge part for only a 12 year old actor and this being her first film. One thing that caught my attention was the amount of special affects and computer editing that was done to make the movie. It was not a long drawn out movie or a get right to the point movie but it kept you interested all through the movie. Also the movie was 2 hours long not like other family movies that are 1 hour and 10 minutes or so.Not many movies do I watch 15 times in a week for a month but this one I did that's how great I thought it was. I think the new 1998 film beats out the 1961 film by miles. One reason is it is set in my time and not 1961.Here is some info about Lindsay Lohan she was born on July 2,1986 in New York ,NY and is currently 12. The filming of this movie started in June of 97 and ended in December of 97. Lindsay is recently back in school in which she is advanced in math and science. She is 5,0 tall and likes to swim, shop, and roller blade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was dying to see this movie because I had loved the Hayley Mills version so much growing up. I went in with expectations for a "cute" movie, but not one as good as the first. I also went to see Lindsay Lohan, who I had adored as Allie on Another World.I was blown away by this film. My eyes were repeatedly filled with tears {when Hallie and Annie realize they are sisters, when they switch and meet the other parents for the first time--especially Hallie meeting her mom!, when Chessie realizes that she's looking at Annie and not Hallie}. Lindsay Lohan will amaze and stun you with her talent, humor, and beauty. Natasha Richardson and Dennis Quaid are unbelievable as well.I was impressed at how the writers had updated the film, yet kept the flair, story, and some of the lines from the original version. When Hallie breaks into "Let's Get Together," you can't help but smile! This movie will delight you, as will Lindsay Lohan--she'll go on to do great things.If you loved the first, you will ADORE this version. If you have yet to see the first, you will love this, but go see Hayley Mills' version first!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Put all skepticism aside as you come into this film. Lindsay Lohan does a wonderful and touching job as twins Hallie and Annie. Her British/American accents are flawless and she instantly grabs the audience's hearts and sympathies from the opening scenes onwards.The plot of this film follows the original fairly closely, although the locations are often different (in this film one twin hails from London rather than Boston.) Rather than trying to mearly copy the original, the film stands quite strongly on its own feet, and even features several elements in homage to the original film. One delightful example is the appearance of Joanna Barnes (who portrayed "the other woman" Vicki in the original) as Meredith's mother "Vicky" (which was also her name in the original film.)The whole cast radiates with energy and enthusiasm. Lohan is the real standout here, taking two established characters and making them her own. This film is a winner that can be enjoyed by the entire family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake of the 1960s classic is almost better than the original. I was skeptical if Lindsay Lohan could recapture the charm of Haley Mills, but she pulls it off wonderfully. Unlike the parents in the original, Natasha Richardson and Dennis Quaid aren't fighting all the time. They are instead playing two people who married and divorced very quickly but never lost their feelings for one another. This is one of the best family films I have seen in quite a while. I would recommend it to fans of the original because it is just as charming and there are many little in-jokes referring to the 1960s version. I would also recommend it to those who have yet to see the original, but are great fans of Disney films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a great family film. Though it may not blow your mind, like Fight Club does, it is purely for fun. Lindsay Lohan creates a stunning performance; I admire her for this even though she now has boob implants. It is romantic yet childishly sweet movies like this that keep America young at heart. There is plenty of bickering, scheming, humor, mischief, and, of course, the mushy stuff. I don't know how they did it, but this was beyond mushy... it was an actual love story. I'm pretty sure many viewers are biased that this movie is a Disney feature with Lindsay Lohan, and they come skeptical. WAtch it and just enjoy a film for crying out loud. you will love this We don't always need a Pulp Fiction. For all i know, The Parent Trap had great LAUDABLE acting, it masterfully created the mood for romance, and had an unpredictable ending. Its a 10 (the only 10 i give for family films).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Parent Trap " is good but its star Lindsay Lohan is better as she was able to steal my breath away in dual roles playing Hallie and Annie Parker. Working with such a clever plot, Lohan has almost single handily pulled off one of the best performances of 1998.Also, what a breath a fresh air to Hollywood as she explodes on the scene as one of the best child actresses I've seen in a long time. The proof is a movie called "The Parent Trap."Lohan's performance is great but we also must not forget that it stars Dennis Quaid as one of the best actors I've seen. With his versatile talent in film genres such as drama, action, or family, Quaid has the ability to capture my attention for the length of the movie."The Parent Trap" is a light hearted film that will allow the mind to flow freely while sitting and relaxing. In addition, the movie was not only clever, but original because Lohan pulled off her role as she knew what she was doing without having to be told what to do. Lohan is a natural talent that should be treasured because she is so good and seen in more filmsThe supporting cast also fit, which made it that much more enjoyable to watch. Good cast choices all the way around. I suggest that everyone see this film because it is really good clean fun with one of the brightest and youngest stars to hit Hollywood. Bravo to the cast and crew of "The Parent Trap."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible spoilers!I loved the original when I saw it on Wonderful World of Disney, so when I found out they were remaking it, I was worried. But I really enjoyed it!Linsey Lohan does and excellent job of carrying her two roles. Natasha Richardson and Dennis Quaid are terrific as the exes that their twin girls want to reunite. Natasha does a great job of portraying the confusion of loving someone but thinking that it won't work out. Simon Kurz and Lisa Ann Walter are also very good as Lizzie's butler and Nick's housekeeper; and the way they are part of each family is very sweet. The scenes at the hotel and the camping trip are absolutely hilarious! This remake is good for adults and kids; the scenes with Lindsey Lohan are goofy, but not so silly an adult would groan. And the scenes with the parents interacting are sweet, but not so syrupy that kids would start gagging.I loved the original, but the musical numbers in it are a bit cheezy. Luckily, there are no musical bits in this remake. But there is a quick humming of the tune "Let's Get Together" (from the original) at one point. It's just a sweet dream of what could happen in life if love really conquered all and children ruled the world. I know, I know, the plot is unbelievable, but sometimes you gotta watch a movie where *everything* comes out alright at the end.Oh, and make sure to sit through the credits! "Photos" are scattered throughout the ending credits that give you an idea on what happened at the wedding....Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of the original Parent Trap, so I was a little nervous about this remake. Well, I shouldn't have worried because this is a delightfully fun, family movie that pays due respect to the original Hayley Mills version. (At one point, Lindsay Lohan sings a few bars of "Lets Get Together", and if I am not mistaken, the woman who plays Meredith's mother in this film was the original "Other woman" in the Hayley Mills version).Lindsay Lohan is wonderful. She plays both characters distinctly and with comfortable ease. The entire cast is great, especially "Chessy" and "Martin" - I loved Chessy's line: "Don't look at me, I don't know a thing!" And I loved seeing "Flo" from tv's "Alice", Polly Holliday, in the role of Marva, Sr. I just love her!The music is also great in this film; my favorite is "There She Goes", played when Hallie first arrives in London.This is a terrific movie all the way around. Lots of fun, perfect for the whole family. See it, you won't regret it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Used &amp; improved on the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the book club paperback in the late 60s, saw the 1961 movie (note that this is *not* the 1950 original) in the 70s, and this 1998 remake last night. I enjoyed all thoroughly; the remake is the superior movie because it gave tribute to its forebears and built well upon the 1961 version. The most memorable cinematography from the original movie were reprised in the remake, and several points of acting and direction were improved. I've long been a fan of Haley Mills (and her older sister); Lindsay Lohan has done an excellent job of studying both Mills and Patty Duke (several of the Hallie/Annie interactions were lovingly stolen from Patty/Cathy Lane). She acts like a young Jodie Foster, which brings credible depth to a role that is easily left shallow (ref. Olsen twins in "It Takes Two"). There were a few weak points. First of all, the first "tingly" scene, where Annie deduces that they're twins, has the slow timing aimed solely at the younger audience. This is one of the few points where the direction fails to accomodate the wide range of ages who will love this flick. Next, although split-screen technology is much improved, those of us who grew up with the play-my-own-twin genre get a little tired of the uncreative cuts and framing after about an hour; George Lucas taught us how to do better. Also, a "family" movie should not have a single word of vulgar profanity, but this version slips one in (the example is left as an exercise for the viewer). In keeping with the 90s, the parents are much more developed, and Meredith is played much better than Vicki was, especially as she steals a few mannerisms from Glenn Close in "101 Dalmatians" (which origianl also appeared in 1961), and gets appropriately tagged for it. Not to be left behind, Joanna Barnes (1961's stepmother-to-be) reappears as "Vicki Blake" (Meredith's mother), and repeats her 1961 interpretation for an excellent cameo (as well as supporting Meredith's characterization). I heartily recommend that you see both Disney versions of the film. Start with the 1961 version (or the 1950 German version if you're a real cinema lover) so you can properly appreciate the updating. Keep in mind that this movie was made in the "Ozzie &amp; Harriet" days, when divorce was rarely discussed and a shame on the children, and movie characters could be rather well defined by a single tragedy such as this. Enjoy it for what it is ... and then see this remake. It certainly beats a Raiders-Packers game on a Sunday afternoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw The Parent Trap in mid-June. Being 15 years old, I'm not a big fan of Disney movies any more. But my parents were watching the movie in the family room when I came in the read the newspaper, and I must say I was captivated by the entire movie!I remember hearing last August that Disney made a remake of The Parent Trap. I had seen the original, and I must admit that I thought it would not be nearly as good as the original. I must also admit that I was wrong.As hard as it may be to believe, this is even better than the original! Lindsay Lohan does a spectacular job portraying both Hallie Parker and Annie James; and to think this is her first movie! Natasha Richardson and Dennis Quaid both make wonderful performances as the girls parents. Simon Kunz and Lisa Ann Walter also do a great job portraying Annie's butler and Hallie's nanny, respectfully. This was based of the 1961 parent Trap, starring Hayley Mills, that was written by David swift. Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer wrote the script for the remake and Meyers was director and Shyer producer. You'll remember the duo from their work with the Father of the Bride movies. Elaine Hendrix also does a great job playing Meredith, the evil step-mother-to-be. Ronnie Stevens also does an excellent job playing Annie's grandfather.The movie starts out when the girls are sent to Camp Walden For Girls in Maine. While there, they meet and aren't very fond of each other. They start playing practical jokes on each other until the camp directors, Marva Kulp Sr. and Marva Kulp Jr. (played by Polly Holliday and Maggie Wheeler, respectively) send them to an isolation cabin for them to spend the rest of the summer there. While there, the girls try to make the best of things and start to talk to each other. They then begin to realize that they are amazingly similar to each other. After a while, they finally realize that they are twins! With each child wanting to meet their other parent, the girls devise and elaborate plan to switch places, hoping that when their parents realize they have the wrong child, they will have to switch them back and see each other after a hiatus of eleven years.I won't tell you anymore about the movie, but it is highly recommended. I also suggest that you see the original one, so you can see the similarities and differences between the two movies. You'll be able to see how the time difference between the two movies can make them seem much different, even though they have the same plot. If you liked the first one, you'll love this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not often that I say that; that a remake of a movie is better than the original. I would still suggest that you see them both, since both are good movies. This version has a few things that make it better. First (and probably most importantly) it has a 90s attitude instead of a 60s one. Second, the girl from England is much less stuck up than the girl from Boston. Third, the parents actually talked out their differences in this version and acknowledged how troublesome their relationship could be, both on themselves and their daughters. All this made for a much more enjoyable movie. The only thing I missed from the original that wasn't in this version was the catchy tune the girls were whistling on the way to the isolation cabin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie expecting to enjoy myself. I got more than my money's worth! Lindsay Lohan did a spectacular job as twins. Its hard to believe that this is her first movie. Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson played their parts very well, and were believable as a divorced couple with lingering affection for each other. Unlike some other movies, such as , in my opinion, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, The Parent Trap provided characters that I could feel for.I have seen the original movie many times, but I think this one out shines it. I find there is more believability here than the Hayley Mills version. I was delighted that there were some small details that survived here. I believe it was Hallie who was singing a line from "Let's Get Together", the song Hayley Mills sang in the original.This movie appealed to me as an adult, and to the child within me. I fully plan to see this movie again and again. Its great for kids of all ages!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Parent Trap is by far the best family film to come out this year. With a perfect blend of old and new, it surpasses the original. The tricky task of making the parents not be simply plot ploys is done very well, and Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson are charming and funny in their roles. Many moments make one burst into laughter. Perhaps the best part of the film is Lindsay Lohan. Instead of trying to improve on the Hayley Mills role, she creates a great character of her own, and is natural and completely unself-conscious, spunky and easy to root for. Give the girl a hand!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give Me Back Brian Keith &amp; Maureen O</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This more modern remake is only good as far as you can endure the grinning Lindsay Lohan. She actually is awfully good; the problem is that the parents are absolutely colorless and too much emphasis is put on the little girl(s). She is pretty and lively, but shouldn't have to carry the entire film. The original film had a balance, because Brian Keith, Maureen OHara and Charles Ruggles were wonderful actors and their roles were written as strong characters.The original parents parted because they were stubborn and headstrong people, not simply self-involved -- as the remake parents seem to be. Only Kramer vs. Kramer could get away with divergent careers as a reason for divorce and leave us with sympathy for the couple. Perhaps Disney has determined that only children will watch the movie, so the adult roles in the film are extraneous and do not matter. Disney didn't use to film this way. They made good movies! I do enjoy, however, the nods given in the new film to the old one: the Kulp sisters of the camp named for Nancy Kulp, the original Vicky Blake actually playing Meredith's mother, and so on.</fullReview>

I'm not too crazy about how she's looking now (Aug 2005) but she's adorable in this role, and her enthusiasm is contagious. I was really swept away by her characters Annie and Hallie, and thought she carried the roles extremely well. Both Richardson and Quaid were good, and didn't overpower Lohan's performance. I loved the characters Chessy and Martin, but wasn't too impressed with the villainous Meredith, whom I thought overplayed a role that would have been more threatening if played a little cooler. The movie made me laugh and cry, and I would definitely recommend it to family and adult friends alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Clean Dysfunctional Family Fun?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple get divorced (for no good reason that is ever explained)and decide to each take one of their twin daughters with them - so as never to have to communicate with each other again. Subsequently, both parents appear to forget they ever had a second child, never bother to tell either twin that the other exists or discuss with them their missing parent. That is the ridiculous premise upon which The Parent Trap is built. And this, one reviewer described as "good, clean family fun"? Good clean dysfunctional family fun, perhaps.If you can get beyond the glaring flaws in the plot you'll be impressed by the cast. Lindsay Lohan is exceptional. Even her English accent is flawless - pretty amazing for an actress of any age never mind one of eleven! And it is especially commendable as it is the only accurate reference to England and the English in the entire film.We don't have "Oreos" (or however you spell it) in England so when Halle/Annie both claim to have always enjoyed eating them with peanut butter it just comes across as clumsy product placement. But then again, Disney's chocolate box version of London only exists in the mind of people who've never visited it.Annie's relationship with her "Butler" is too intimate for a professional relationship and their handshake ritual is, frankly, ridiculous. As is the pairing of said camp butler with butch nanny in the romance stakes.An odd film, not badly made but still odd. It trivializes divorce and its repercussions in the context of a family entertainment. A contradiction in terms, me thinks. In the real world, parents like these should have been "trapped" by social services but that would hardly make for Disney entertainment, would it?!</fullReview>

Young Lindsay Lohan (playing both girls, as did Hayley Mills in the original) is a perky, but trite and innocuous tyke, and this camp where the kids meet is ridiculously "Hollywood" (the girls fence and play poker on the side...what world are screenwriters Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer from?). Meyers, who also directed, does well by the adults (Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson), but her scenario is so loaded with sticky-sweet sentiments and happy endings that the end result is weighed-down with false, heavy treacle. * from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very nice remake of the 1961 Hayley Mills vehicle from Disney. Fun for the whole family. Indentical twins, Hallie and Annie(both played by Miss Lindsay Lohan in her movie debut), have been long separated, because of divorced parents. Dad is Nick Parker(Dennis Quaid) a wealthy Napa Valley vineyard owner and mom Elizabeth James(Natasha Richardson)is a London fashion designer. The twins accidentally meet at summer camp and decide to get their divorced parents back together again. For a little girlish mischief they swap places and actually screw up the plans of a beautiful publicist Meredith(Elaine Hendrix)from sinking her gold digging claws into their dad with marriage on her mind. A pleasant soundtrack features: Linda Ronstadt, George Harrison, The Loving Spoonful and Young Holt Unlimited. Also in the cast: Lisa Ann Walter, Simon Kunz and Ronnie Stevens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite My Best Efforts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't criticize Disney's remake of its original, The Parent Trap because it wouldn't be sporting. Yet, there's nothing there to criticize, anyway. This is the ultimate in a little girl's movie. I have a tweenager who has seen this thing at least 30 times (my count is three) and other than the criminally cruel act of having a couple split, taking a twin a piece, and not bothering to tell the children about their twin, there's nothing to gritch about.Except . . .Seeing little Lindsay Lohan, about as bright, talented, and charismatic a 12 year old as you'll ever come across, turn out to be a wreck of a 21 year old, with paparazzi snapping away at her obviously intentionally exposed external reproductive organs is nothing less than heartbreakingly dispiriting.I think it's the dad in me that makes me cringe every time Jay Leno tells some new, lurid joke about Lohan's latest vehicular catastrophe. I keep asking myself if someone, anyone could have kept the cute little kid in TPT from turning into, along with Britney Spears, a national crotch joke.Which brings me back to the movie--and Freaky Friday and Herbie, the other two Lohan movies I've seen. They're all fantasies, obviously. Yet, they are both sad and comforting. Sad because they aren't real, and comforting--comforting because my innocent tweenager doesn't know about the wrecking of the little girl she likes to watch in The Parent Trap.And, if I can help it, she won't know for a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Parent Trap, with Lindsay Lohan is better than the original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Parent Trap, with Lindsay Lohan is better than the original! I can't think of any other remake that I feel is superior to a fine original. But Nancy Meyer's version is better in every respect.First off, Lindsay Lohan is a real talent. She is extraordinary in this challenging role. And unlike in the 1961 version, they did not make the twins hideous looking with horrible short wigs! And Nancy Meyers very wisely kept the camp part of the movie to about thirty minutes. She realized that the movie doesn't truly begin until the parents meet again for the first time. So she jettisons overdoing any camp hi jinx and quickly moves the story along to when the twins have switched places with each other.Dennis Quaid is so wonderful as the dad. Ruggedly sexy and gorgeous he exudes manliness. His performance makes the movie. Natasha Richardson is not my favorite pick for the mom. She is surprisingly dowdy for a fashion designer. Her clothes, except for the dress she wore for dinner on the yacht are horrible. And her hair needed a color touch up. Her dark roots were so distracting throughout the movie. I didn't find it believable that a gorgeous man like Quaid would fall in love with this average looking woman.Elaine Hendrix was outstanding as Meredith Blake. She is gorgeous and just catty enough. Her scenes with the twins were great fun.Simon Kunz, as Martin, the butler and Lisa Ann Walter as Chessy, were standouts too.Everything about the 1998 version was superior. Fabulous scenery and just a more fun version of this classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Second time's definitely the charm when you watch both the 1961 Hayley Mills version, and this updated 1998 Lindsay Lohan (her first movie, as shown in the opening credits) version, both bearing the same name: "The Parent Trap!"This movie follows pretty much the same storyline as the original, except that we have a girl and her dad live in the California Wine Country, and we have another girl and her mom; they live in London, England. Both girls end up at the same camp and, while fencing, they seem to know each other quite well!!!!! They think that they are twins, and now, they had to switch places because the British girl doesn't know her dad, and the American girl doesn't know her mom!!!!! But do not fear, for they will sort things out immediately!!!!!This remake is genius; however, I'd stay very, very, VERY far away from the "Freaky Friday" remake, however. I give this version a 10 only because it's a "Golden Age" flick.</fullReview>

Hallie: Why I ought to!Hallie: I have a brilliant beyond brilliant idea!Annie: That girl is, without a doubt, the most horrible creature that ever walked the face of this planet! Hallie: Thank you, thank you very much.Annie as Hallie: Chessy, I changed a lot over the summer, that's all. Chessy, the Parker's Maid: OK, boy if I didn't know any better I'd say it's almost like you were... forget it, it's impossible. Annie as Hallie: Almost if I were who, Chessy? Chessy, the Parker's Maid: Nobody, nobody, forget I mentioned it. Annie as Hallie: Almost if I were, Annie? Chessy, the Parker's Maid: You know about Annie? Annie as Hallie: I am Annie.Elizabeth James: You're not Annie? Hallie as Annie: That would be correct. Elizabeth James: You're Hallie? Hallie as Annie: I am. Annie and I met at the camp and, and we decided to switch places. I'm sorry, but I've never seen you and I've dreamed of meeting you my whole life and Annie felt the exact same way about Dad so, so we sort of just switched lives. I hope you're not mad because I love you so much, and I just hope that one day you could love me as me, and not as Annie. Elizabeth James: Oh darling, I've loved you your whole life!Hallie as Annie: His and hers kids. No offense, Mom, but this arrangement really sucks. Elizabeth James: I agree, it totally sucks.Hallie: We actually did it!Hallie: I'll tell you what. I'll make you a little deal. Loser jumps into the lake after the game. Annie: Excellent. Hallie: Butt naked. Annie: Even more excellent. Start unzipping Parker. Straight, in diamonds. Hallie: You're good James, but, you're just not good enough. In your honor, a royal flush.Annie: Any of your pictures ruined? Hallie: Only the beautiful Leo DiCaprio... Annie: Who? Hallie: You've never heard of Leonardo DiCaprio? How far away is London anyway? Elizabeth James: Where are we? Nick Parker: This is where we're eating? Hallie: No. Actually that's where we're eating. Annie: It's ours for the night. Nick Parker: Wow. So, how exactly are we paying for this? Annie: Well, we pooled our allowances. Nick Parker: Yeah. Right.Annie? Annie: Okay. Grandfather chipped in a bit. Elizabeth James: Annie! Annie: Okay.

What adds to the greatness of this film is that it appeals to both children and adults. Dennis Quaid and Natalie Richards were wonderful to fill the romantic rolls of the twins parents. Two divorced parents being subject to their twin daughter's scheming proved to be both entertaining and enjoyable to watch. With so many same scenarios as the first film, it was neat to see how they re-did those scenes and made the 1960's film a cool 1990's film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My summary title says it all. I honestly can't believe how absurd this movie is. The villain is incredibly over the top to where they might as well be laughing every scene she's in (hell she practically does several times) even for a kids movie this movie's storyline has a lot of conveniences. Such as how both of Lindsey Lohan's parents are still in love with each other (even though I don't remember why they broke up in this movie) and even how the two "twins" meet. Something that I will give this movie credit though is that even though it's just a average kids movie it's not degrading to any of the actors. It also shows early talent from Lindsey Lohan which makes it a shame that she later appears in movies such as "I know Who killed Me"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original is better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>in my opinion, the original is the best. this version is good as it is more modern, but if u ask me Natasha Richardson's performance didn't quite stand up against Maureen O'Hara's in the original. Maureen had more personality in the role and maybe it was because of the script but i felt Natasha Richardsons character was a little boring. I don't think she stood up and had an impact. In the original, Mareens wardrobe and hair was changed and we knew that she had it somewhere in her head to get back with Mitch. Natasha's character didn't change her appearance and i felt that it was a let down as it was part of the story. Also, there seemed more chemistry between Maureen and Brian Keith, especially in the scene where she punches him in the eye..they didn't even attempt to do that scene in this version!! that must tell you something!! however Lindsay Lohan was brilliant...probably the only benefit of watching this remake. Maureen O'Hara in combination with Brian Keith made the parent trap what it was.Anyone agree or disagree?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was pretty good, but actually, I think I liked the old one better. I hope I'm not offending anyone when I say Lindsay Lohan wasn't a very good actor when she was a kid. She was okay, but not all "OH JEEZ SHE USED TO BE SUCH A GREAT ACTRESS". I did like some things better. I liked the butler, and I liked the tricks at camp more than I did in the older one. I really laughed at that! And I liked the special high-five; that was really funny. I would have liked the camp that Annie and Hallie went to. It looked like fun! It was great, in both versions of The Parent Trap, how Annie and Hallie hated each other at first and ended up being inseparable. A pretty good film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely the worst version of all the films on the subject. I even liked "It Takes Two" better, mainly because Kirstie Alley and Steve Guttenberg are much more fun to watch. Nonetheless....I can accept that the story might be material for a good family picture...unfortunately not even David Swift succeeded in making it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with another author who said that the one dimensional "support" characters...that is, everyone but Lohman...did not help this film. The original was indeed more of a cast movie, there were several good roles. I was embarrassed for Dennis Quaid. Talk about phoning in a performance! And there was no relationship evident- past or present, with Natasha Richardson's character. Neither had substance.And the ridiculous "butler"- what's with that? Was he meant to be gay originally and then the writers changed their minds? The little dance with Annie was also embarrassing. It appears that no one gave any thought to character development at all. Why oh why did the parents get together in the first place, and ditto for the second time around.The main interest here is comparing it to the much superior 1961 version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have they fired Eisner yet?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For fans of the original, this was a waste of time. However, it was a noble attempt at remaking a good story for a new audience. And Lohan has become the Disney company's new Haley Mills. (Too bad she is quickly transforming into another Britney-clone.) But can someone explain to Mr. Eisner that he needs to make NEW movies, not ride on the shoulders of the Disney genius of old? This film was made amongst a slew of mediocre remakes of and unnecessary and uncalled-for sequels to some great Disney classics.No wonder the company is in trouble; when you have this little imagination, how are you supposed to run the greatest Magic Factory in all of entertainment?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than The Original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original version of, The Parent Trap starring Hayley Hills was good but this new version, starring Lindsay Lohan, playing both the twins and the brilliant Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson playing the parents is much better. Nancy Meyers, who has directed many good comedy-movies, is the director here and she does a really great job. The screen-play is brilliant too. Well, we all know the story, don't we? Identical twins Hallie and Annie were separated at birth when their parents divorced. Hallie lives with her father, Nick, in California and Annie lives with her mother, Lizzie, in England. When they meet at summer camp, they plan to reunite there parents back together, but first they have to get rid of Nicks horrible new girlfriend, Meredith. The Parent Trap is such a good, fun, family, comedy, movie, which I'm sure *everyone* will love. If you've seen the original or even if you haven't, you should see this movie. Good performances by all, especially, the BRILLIANT Dennis Quaid. I give this brilliant movie a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lohan Carries This Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Parent Trap (1998): Dir: Nancy Meyers / Cast: Lindsay Lohan, Dennis Quaid, Natasha Richardson, Polly Holiday, Elaine Hendrix: Remake of 1961 classic referring to twins who conspire to bring their parents back together. They are a symbol of meaning to both adults. Twins discover their birthright at summer camp after their parents split fourteen years ago. In an attempt to get them back together they switch places. The outcome is so obvious that when one character says, "Who would've thought, my nanny, your butler?" Directed by Nancy Meyers who remains faithful to the original despite the little if anything the film really offers. What it does present is a great double performance by a leading lady who gives the film more than it deserves. Lindsay Lohan chews scenery as the twins despite travelling ground that has been travelled. Thankfully her charm elevates it but doesn't save it. Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson play the typical parental figures. Three years prior to this Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen starred in the dreary It Takes Two as if changing the title would create a sense of originality. It was the same stupid pitiful storytelling that this tired remake would attempt to capitalize upon. Of course, this film is aimed at children who may delight in Lohan's ability to do what it took two Olsens to do. Pointless sequel proves that Hollywood has fallen into a trap of no good ideas. Score: 3 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie will be loved by all teenage girls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure this movie will be loved by all teenage girls, exactly the group of people Disney targets with this kind of movies. Personally I thought it was much too corny and oh so predictable, but I'm not a teenage girl of course.Imagine: Two 11-year old girls meet each other at summer camp. One comes from California and the other from London. They resemble to each other, not only in looks but also in taste. Of course they find out they are twins and that they got separated at a young age, when their parents divorced. The first wants to see her dad for the first time, the other her mom. They switch places and they will live with the other parent. Of course the girls want to get their parents back together but there is a problem. Their father has a girlfriend, which is of course an absolute bitch who hates the kids, but no problem: They will arrange a meeting anyway and do whatever is necessary to get them back together. From one thing comes another and of course they fall in love again...Perhaps it is just me, but I don't believe in this kind of "romantic" stories with a lot of pink ribbons around it and beautiful red hearts shooting trough the air. I guess that's not what girls want to hear, and certainly not 11-year olds. But no problem, they'll learn it later on.Even though I thought it was very predictable and way too corny it also had a good point: the acting. It really wasn't bad. That's also the reason why I still give this movie a 5/10. If I had been a teenage girl it would probably have been a 9 or even a 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poorly executed drivel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe this to be the third remake of this movie, the first one I saw way back and I think it was German with English subtitles and I think the translated title was "Twice upon a time". A movie made in the fifties and very well done with a believable script. The second was the one with Hayley Mills, also extremely well done (whatever happened to Hayley and her sister Juliet, anyway?)However, this version strained the outward limits of credibility for me. The one dimensional almost second wife and the absolutely luxurious lifestyles of the separated parents just for starters - I mean really. The ongoing problems with continuity kept me amused all the way through and the hit and miss accents of the twins, could they not afford to hire two kids? All in all I recommend not wasting your time but watch the Hayley version or if you can get your hands on it the original. 4 out of 10 from me (and only for the wonderful Natasha Richardson (what was she thinking!), 6 out of 10 from the 8 year old in my life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lindsay Lohan as twins did her job fantastic. I am not sure whether it is an original story or adopted from other foreign language movie, Because there is an Indian movie ( Telugu movie - Letha Manasulu) made in 1966 has similar story line.Halley and Annie both twins played by Lindsay Lohan are separated as their parents get divorced. They meet in a camp and then realise their relation and try to unite their parents successfully. They play tricks to scare away the new girl who enters into their father's life by playing naughty tricks and finally succeed in uniting their parents.There are lots of interesting moments for children who will really enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a child, this was always my favourite movie, and I always insisted people to call me Hallie after I finished watching it. On the recommendation from my friend to see my opinion on it years later, I was surprised to find I still loved.Lindsay Lohan was - and still is a brilliant actress. I love Annie and Hallie - they're two of the best characters I've seen in Disney movies in a long time. (Plus, you just had to love Annie's accent - well done Lohan!) I loved the plot too! And the script was well-written and suited the characters really well. I'd recommend it to anyone - it's a brilliant family movie, and it's pretty good to watch on your own to get a few laughs, too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stick with the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all remember the original parent trap; fun and innocent with a commendable performance by Hayley Mills. This Disney carbon-copy remake with Lindsey Lohan only serves to demonstrate how little original thought exists in the minds of mainstream film producers. Since we've seen the movie before and are now given the same in a less nostalgic, less humorous, less emotionally involving form, this version not only fails to add anything (besides a new cast), but unfortunately simply goes through the motions. Lastly, because of the emotional distance (we feel nothing for the parents and little for the twins) of this cast with the audience, this version simply highlights the superiority of Brian Keith, Maureen O'Hara and Hayley Mills and Hayley Mills.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake is based loosely on the original movie by the same name with Haley Mills. The movie is OK at times, but at times it looks like the filmakers did not even follow the original movie. The acting is quite flat, as most of disney's live action movies nowadays. The two main people , Dennis Quaid and the actress who is the mother have been in better movies than this family junk!!Quaid was excellent was the movies "D.O.A.", "The Big Easy" to name a few!!If you like family movies , then watch it , but be advised the original one is better despite being 30 years old!!!Disney please stop remaking your classic movies please!!!If you do remake them , make them the same as the original movie!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this piece of garbage because my then girl friend insisted we see it and refused to let me sleep in the theater. To this day I can't make the Psycho Hose Beast understand that I hated this movie. All of the characters were stupid in this thing. Everyone can see that the girls are exactly identical to each other, yet nobody can figure out that they're twins until they find a picture of their parents. About half way through, the film makers realized they had no plot, so they wrote in some weak thing about some snobby chick trying to marry her way into Dennis Quaid's money, so the girls decide that the best is to get their parents back together. "Sure, they drove each other nuts and grew to hate each other the first time, but I'm sure it will work perfectly this time." Anyone over the age of five who can sit through this entire thing without wanting to strangle those two brats is either in therapy or belongs there.</fullReview>
