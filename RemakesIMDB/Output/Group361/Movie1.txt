		<fullReview>"Family" movies usually make me cringe. Saccharine plots, cloying kiddie actors, goopy dialogue...no, thank you! But "The Parent Trap" succeeds admirably as both children-friendly fare and reasonably witty, sophisticated comedy. The high-class production values don't hurt, and neither does the superb cast, right down to the character roles. The ever-dependable Una Merkel is a gem as the smart-talking maid, having lost none of her streetwise timing since her brassy blonde days in the 1930's. Charlie Ruggles is extraordinarily lovable as the grandfather, and Cathleen Nesbitt plays wonderfully against type as the domineering grandmother. Leo G. Carroll once again benefits a film simply by his appearance, and even Nancy "Miss Hathaway" Kulp is on board as a butch camp counselor (quite a stretch). Of course, at the heart of it all, is the bravura performance of Hayley Mills as twins Susan and Sharon. She's never revoltingly sweet--there's a winning streak of spice in her personality that separates her from all other child stars. Plus, her kicky pre-Beatles British accent and snub-nosed beauty lend her a more worldly air than her contemporaries. The ravishing Maureen O'Hara, in one of her last major roles as the twins' mother, Maggie, begins the film as a nondescript cipher, but her glamorous metamorphosis in the latter half of the film shows just how funny and sexy she can be. Mitch, the twins' father, is played by the ruggedly handsome Brian Keith, who generates the right mixture of roughneck toughness and paternal warmth.And the criminally-overlooked Joanna Barnes plays Vicki, the predatory golddigger looking to sink her claws into Mitch. Vicki's verbal duels with Maggie and the twins are surprisingly catty for a children's film, and delivered with perfect villainy. The very 1961 flourishes are priceless: the hopelessly tone-deaf Tommy Sands and Annette Funicello "singing" the theme song; the "formal" dance, with the girls all decked out in crinolines and laces; Susan plastering her bungalow wall with pictures of her favorite pin up boys (Rick Nelson!); and, my personal favorites, Sharon and Susan showing each other their parents' photos: hyper-posed, glamorous Hollywood 8x10 glossies! The plot actually plays like a highly sanitized Rock Hudson/Doris Day bedroom farce, except that Susan and Sharon direct the course of action. You know what the ending will be even before you watch the movie, but it doesn't really matter. This is a delicious bon-bon of a flick, as irresistible to adults as to their children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Charmer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the split-screen technique had been around for a decade or so, it was usually more noted for its failures than its success, and the actor required to play dual roles usually took tremendous heat for their failure to create two physically identical but distinctly different characterizations on screen. But with THE PARENT TRAP, with the difficult dual role resting on the shoulders of an extremely young star, Walt Disney struck gold. It would be the single highest grossing film the studio had released up to that time, and even some forty years later the baby-boomers who flocked to see it in 1961 regard it as one of their favorite movie experiences.But THE PARENT TRAP has a lot more going for it than mere nostalgia. The cast is really, really good, featuring the ever-likable Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith in leading roles and a host of great character actors (including Leo G. Carroll and Nancy Kulp) in minor roles. And then there is Haley Mills. The daughter and sister of noted English actors, Mills was no newcomer to the screen when THE PARENT TRAP went before the cameras--she had even picked up an Oscar for her earlier Disney film POLLYANNA. Even so, this was no guarantee that she could pull off the feat of double roles, something that had daunted even the legendary Bette Davis. But she did.The story has been told so often that surely every one knows it by now. A wife delivers twin daughters--but shortly afterward divorces her husband, and each wins custody of one child. The children are raised without any knowledge of each other's existence... until they unexpectedly bump into each other at summer camp, put two and two together, and devise a scheme to get their parents back together again.Even today, and in spite of its familiarity, it's an amusing idea, and while the actual script is weak in spots the cast, and especially Haley Mills, makes the most of it. There's plenty of slapstick, lots of laugh-out-loud scenes, and enough charm to beguile all but the most cynical viewers. And Haley Mills clearly demonstrates why she was regarded as the single most gifted child actor of her era: although she plays both Susan and Sharon with the same edge of mischievous fun, they do indeed come off as completely different personalities.Of course, digital technology has left the old split-screen technique in the dust, and today its easy to see the flaws in the technique that weren't so obvious at the time. And the quality of the film transfer is not the best: while this isn't the worst transfer I've seen, it is full of artifacts nonetheless. Even so, the appeal of the story, the cast, and most particularly Haley Mills make up for a lot, and this Disney double DVD comes complete with a host of bonuses (including a making-of documentary and an audio commentary track by director David Swift and Haley Mills) that fans will enjoy quite a bit.If you were a fan of the film then, you'll remain a fan of it now. And if you want to introduce your family to a truly charming movie experience, you couldn't make a better choice.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Family Film with winning performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hayley Mills does a spectacular job playing twins Sharon and Susan who are split up at birth and then reunited at summer camp. Of course they plan to reunite their divorced parents before a new woman can get her hands on their father! It's not hard to see why this film has remained popular, Mills, O'Hara, and Keith all are wonderful, and even if the story isn't the most believable it is perfectly suited for younger viewers. Forget the 1998 remake, stick with the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the movie, always have. But then, why wouldn't I? Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara, and Hayley Mills? Excellent cast. My parents took me to see this movie when I was a kid -- [I was born in 1955] so I wasn't too old and I totally loved it. I own the VHS and will probably have to buy the DVD, if I can find it.Joanna Barnes is the woman you love to hate -- god wasn't she just wicked and terrible in this movie? You just hate her!!! Calling Hayley - pet, in that exaggerated way. UGH! Brian Keith, god I just loved this man! Loved him in Family Affair too! Always such a good actor. [Some other favorites; Those Calloways, The Pleasure Seekers, Nevada Smith, and especially, With Six you get Eggroll.] Maureen O'Hara, what a wonderful actress. I loved her in this movie, but then love her in any and everything she's done really [some other favorites are; McLintock! and Spencer's Mountain].Cute, cute movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best Disney movies ever made. It is funny, warm, and it is something everybody can enjoy. To watch this in the twenty first century is a wonderful trip back in time. This movie is very 60's, but that does not make it out of date, the tricks and gags are timeless. I loved this movie when I saw it for the first time many years ago. Therefore, when the new 1998 remake came out, I had to see that too. The new one is also sweet and warm, but the original version is the best. If you see this version first and then all or some of the new afterwards (as I tried, for fun, one was on TV and I have the other on DVD), the new one reveals itself as being superficial and a bit cheasy compared to the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lets Get Together (and watch the Parent Trap) Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Part of the joy of Christmas is all the surprises that come with it. What neat things will I find in my stocking as I sneak downstairs to look in it? What will be in the next present that I open? Will I or won't I glimpse Santa sneaking around my living room? The greatest surprise of all is realizing that the little babe born in the manger is really the creator of the cosmos and of the very manger he is sleeping in.The Parent Trap is like Christmas. It brings smiles, joys and surprises. Imagine going away to summer camp when you discover someone who looks exactly like you standing in the lunch line. Who are they? And why do they have your face? You mean we have the same birthday? You mean we have the same parents? WERE SIBLINGS!!! What would you do in a situation like this? Why switch places with your newly discovered sibling of course.This film has as much intrigue as a James Bond film and as much mystery as an Agatha Christie novel, as the twins plot to get their divorced parents back together. It's great to have a film so blatantly say 'Divorce Really Sucks (the life out of families) And the Sixth Sense style surprises continue to show up throughout the film as the parents and those in the households on each side of the continent realize that the person they thought was one twin really was the other one.Sometimes when the revelation is revealed in a story, the interest level seems to flatten in the storyline, but not in this film. It maintains a high level of interest throughout the film. It's also interesting to note that in that the high quality special effects that were used in the picture were done in an age before computers were as sophisticated as they are today. It is really convincing that there are two Hayley Mills on the screen at the same time. I once did shot the same person on tape using two different hair styles and made it look like she was talking to herself as a different person. It's way cool to do if you know how to do that sort of thing. I also shot myself doing the 'Who's on First' routine.The movie has few flaws if any. At times I had trouble telling the two characters apart but that may be me and is not enough to mention as a real flaw. Some of the characters smoke cigarettes in plain view of children. I mean the horror of it. Overall I think cigarettes stink and are bad for children but I am not a smoking Nazi who would sponge all cigarettes from older films. There are some who would actually do this.Another neat little thing is how they talk about sexuality without actually talking about it. The innocence of a family friendly film is still intact with the reality of the meaning of sexuality and martial love weaved into the seams of the film. All of the actors are a delight to spend two hours with especially Hayley and the guy who played the minister. You also get to witness Hayley kicking the crap out of herself. It's rare you see a good girl fight on film. It's sexist that only men kick the crap out of each other and never women.Part of the reason I loved this film as much as I did in my reviewing of it, is because I was impressed and pleased that Disney could produce such a high quality, mature looking film. This film is not just good for Disney, its' a good film in general. Any Disney slapstick happens as a result of the story and not as a result to just get laughs.This is not worth a rental, it's worth buying and keeping and sharing with loved ones. Rent it by all means if you don't have the money to buy it. This film is Pure Movie Magic. Disney Gold: A warning: Don't be tempted to watch the sequel that is on the same DVD disc, it's bad as the original is good. If the original is Charismas, the sequel is Tax Day eve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing , funny and entertaining family comedy with a sensational Hayley Mills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an agreeable updating from an E. Kastner's story , it deals about two twins little girls (Hayley Mills). When they are in summer holidays and after several antics each other , discover the surprise which they are twin sisters and then they plot change characters with their different parents (Mauren O'Hara , Brian Keith) who are disjointed since the divorce and the girls have been separately raised . The father is going to marry a young woman (Joanna Barnes) and the eleven-years-old girls scheme the parents reconciliation by making impossible life of the father's bride .The picture contains enjoyable comedy , humor , tongue-in-cheek and being pretty entertaining . This classical Disney comedy was remade in 1998 with Lindsay Lohan and previously adapted to British cinema in a movie titled : ¨Twice upon a time¨ (1954) . Hayley Mills acting is sympathetic and amusing . Hayley plays two sisters and she makes it splendidly . Hayley starred two sequels for Television (1986, 1989). Susan Henning took on the role as Hayley Mills' body double for several of the twin shots in the film , as part of her contract, she signed away her rights to be credited . The screenplay originally called for only a few trick photography shots of Hayley Mills in scenes with herself; the bulk of the film was to be shot using a body double. When Walt Disney saw how seamless the processed shots were , he ordered the script reconfigured to include more of the special effect . Mauren O'Hara and Brian Keith are magnificent as parents in similar roles later starred by Natasha Richardson and Dennis Quaid . Joanna Barnes as the unpleasant fiancée is very well , in the remake she played the bride's (incarnated by Elaine Hendrix) mother . The movie will appeal to family comedy enthusiasts . Rating : Amusing and enjoyable . Well worth seeing .</fullReview>

Im not going to compare it with the 1998 version, because even though they have the same name and same basic plot, they are two different styles so how people can say one is better than the other is beyond me. But, the 1961 version IS better.It has everything, comedy, romance, sadness, the acting is superb, not just from Hayley Mills, but you have Brian Keith as Mitch, and Rev. Mosby, 'Bourbon, Double, On the rocks'. I cannot fault this film and cant wait to watch it again.One of the best films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the 1960's Best Films!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the 1998 remake with Lindsay Lohan, I had to check out the 60's version which I thought was unbelievably filmed well! Firstly, before I start ranting on how great the film was, I will say that I don't think that this film doesn't match the remake. Usually I find remade films worse or less superior than the originals but for some reason I just found some more fun in the remake. The original however I think is still excellent and should still be viewed.The plot centers on two twins who discover each other at a girls camp. They find out who each other's parents are and then they decide to con-cock a mischievous plan into swapping places and getting to know each other's parents before meeting again, trying to reunite their parents.The acting, scenery and settings, music score, unique moments and memorable scenes were put together very well and the entire film still holds up to today's standards.My first thoughts were that the film wasn't going to be great at all and that it wasn't going to beat the remake. I was wrong about it being a well made masterpiece, but I was right about it not beating the remake in my opinion.I thought everything was a little different and more absurd whilst I still found more moments (especially the woods scenes). However, I did find the music a little bit too typical (very 50's-60's styled themed music, it sounded like anything else).Overall, I do love this film. I don't have anything negative to say about it, but there's just something about the remake which I found more special, but then again if we didn't have this film, we wouldn't have the remake!!! Anyway, I really believe the film is one of the best 1960's films, ranking right up with 60's horror such as Black Sabbath and Rosemary's Baby. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Favorite During My Tween Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie on Sunday night TV Wonderful World of Disney in 1979 and was hooked. I bought the book at the school book fair and reread it a dozen times.My older sister had seen Parent Trap in the theater and knew all of the parts that 1970s TV had edited out.In the 1980s I finally got to see the whole film uncut on the Disney cable channel and finally got to figure out "the little dolls signing the parent trap song" my sister spoke of (there was 15 minutes I'd never get back)....Dorky animated cupids aside, as a kid I loved the movie's cross country saga. The camp cabin sabotage, the twins joining forces to prank dad's girlfriend.Although most kids will still enjoy the original movie's favorite kid moments of the punchbowl splashing into a chaperon, the timeless cake falling on Miss Inch's face, and Vicky's hissy fit, the movie's long pace might bore todays kids.Although some purists don't like the new remake of Parent Trap, I thought the remake kept the essence of the original story and updated it to match todays global travel, destigmatization of divorce, etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little too long, but original, sassy and smart, with an outstanding Hayley Mills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I do prefer it over the remake. The remake was really nice too, but this has a more special place in my heart. It is a little too long however, and there are one or two moments in the film that could have been less padded such as the interlude at the summer camp.That said, The Parent Trap is a really engaging film, it is sassy, funny and smart with an original concept. The film is really beautiful to look at too, lovely cinematography, costumes and scenery. Another nice component was the music, really tuneful and sweet and most of all memorable.The script is funny, sharp and smart, there is some witty dialogue and also some touching parts too. The direction is equally adept and skillful, David Swift also guided Hayley Mills through her Oscar-winning turn in Pollyanna the previous year.Then there is the acting. Hayley Mills is outstanding in the dual roles of the twins who try to reunite their divorced parents. I first encountered Mills in Tiger Bay, a very underrated film that is and she was just brilliant in it, in fact her performance in that film is one of my all-time favourite child performances. Let's not forget the other actors either, Brian Keith is fine as the father though he could have done with more material, and the stunning Maureen O'Hara is a delight as the mother. There's also Leo G.Carroll, who I am familiar with from his supporting turns in Hitchcock films like Suspicion and Spellbound, it was nice to see him again.Overall, I liked this film very, very much. Not perfect by all means but a delight nonetheless. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A PERFECT family film, well worth 2 hours!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is excellent! It's the story of two twins who were separated shortly after birth when their parents divorce. The twins (both played masterfully by Hayley Mills) accidentally meet up at summer camp 11 years or so later (each not knowing of the other's existence), and through a series of hilarious hijinks, realize that they are sisters and plot to get Mom and Dad back together again. This is a movie that reminds us that marriages, even bad ones, are worth working out and fighting for, a message that is missing in so many Hollywood movies these days. Look for really charming, Oscar-worthy (in my opinion) performances by Una Merkel (Verbeena) and Charles Ruggles (Charles McKendrick). ****SPOILER ALERT**** The scene where the twins first realize who they are and what happened is classic, and worth the price of a rental by itself. The dance number, "Let's Get Together", which the twins perform again later in the movie, is memorable, and you'll be singing it to yourself for weeks later! So, if you want to make a ninny out of yourself by not seeing this movie, it's none of my never mind, that's why I'm not saying a word!10/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary how no one stays together anymore these days. But enough about trashy Hollywood marriages and J-Lo's next big divorce... and on to the topic of great lovers parted by silly quarrels. Like the one in The Parent Trap. Sharon is a conservative Bostonian girl who's getting in touch with nature at summer camp when she meets Susan. Susan is a loose Californian tomboy with a sweet tooth. When the two girls see each other, needless to say the experience is a kin to looking in the mirror in the morning. Only with two different hair styles. The girls look alike! But they have no idea who one another is.At first, the relationship is rocky. They can't get along together. Each figures that the other has a lot of nerve showing up with the same face. Things quickly get juvenile and out of hand. The head of Camp Inch steps in and forces them to share a special isolation cabin as a punishment for fighting at the camp dance- the effect either to drive each other crazy or learn to accept their similarities and become friends. They don't simply become friends, but understand they are indeed sisters. Twin sisters. Then, they compose a plot to bring their estranged parents together again by switching places. And everything gets twisted. Especially when Sharon arrives at her hunky father Mitch's home in Carmel- where pretty young gold-digger Vicky Robinson is swooping in on the family fortune.Actress Hayley Mills becomes a Disney legend. One British girl plays two separate American twins. That's a feat of technical achievement by any standard. The Parent Trap is one of Disney's greatest non-animated features and everyone should see it. Young and old. Though, it will mostly appeal to families with mischievous children. The story includes a subplot of the twin girls playing devilishly clever pranks on anyone who crosses their line. Well-acted, witty, and touching. A masterpiece, big thumbs up. The Disney DVD for The Parent Trap is truly packed with great bonus features and a deal at a reasonably inexpensive price. Get it. Disney made a sequel in 1998.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pleasant whiff of an idea (twin teen girls--separated by their divorcing parents shortly after birth--find each other at summer camp and plan to reunite their folks) gets a big boost not only from the colorful players but by gorgeous photography and production (check out that home in California!). Hayley Mills is very persuasive as lookalike troublemakers Susan and Sharon--and if she gets a little shrill at times, that's OK because her manner is still very likable and, let's face it, she's adorable singing "Let's Get Together (Yeah Yeah Yeah)". Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara are perfect as Mills' parents, the supporting cast is a wonderful collection of screwballs, and the finale (though it takes a while in coming) is very uplifting. An energetic and happy Disney enterprise, quite memorable and eons better than the recent remake. ***1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pretty short-haired Hayley Mills (as Susan Evers) and pretty long-haired Hayley Mills (as Sharon McKendrick) meet at camp and discover they are twins who were separated at birth by divorcing parents Brian Keith (as Mitch) and Maureen O'Hara (as Maggie). At first, the thirteen-year-old girls don't get along, but they soon become fast friends. It doesn't take too much thinking to figure out the plot from here. The twins decide to switch places and bring their parents back together, since neither remarried. But, they must first stop Mr. Keith from marrying gold-digger Joanna Barnes (as Vicky Robinson)...After looking at Maureen O'Hara, I'd consider marrying her. After looking at Mr. Keith's California estate, I'd consider marrying him, too. So, I guess these parents stayed single because, at Ms. Mills deduces, they really do love each other. They sure fight like an old married couple. Why they separated their daughters, and hid them from each other, is inexplicable. While it's never revealed, the daughters must have spent many years in British finishing schools, without running into each other. The "split-screen" is very good, but Mr. Keith's hairpiece does not match properly. Okay, I'm marrying Hayley Mills.***** The Parent Trap (6/12/61) David Swift ~ Hayley Mills, Brian Keith, Maureen O'Hara, Joanna Barnes</fullReview>

Her every line, gesture and expression was perfect. It was Hayley's greatest work, and a triumph for the Disney Studios.The rest of the cast from Maureen O'Hara (at her most beautiful) to Brian Keith (at his most charming) was ideal.

		<shortDescription>One of the best "family" movies Disney ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Featuring the sexy, ruggedly handsome Brian Keith and the flawlessly beautiful Maureen O'Hara, THE PARENT TRAP is a fun and funny family comedy about identical twins Sharon McKendrick and Susan Evers (Hayley Mills, the '60s Disney sweetheart) who don't know each other exists until they meet at a summer mountain camp. Unable to accept that their parents don't still love one another, they scheme to reunite the folks by switching places. Although I found it kind of strange that 2 Americans would have one twin with a British accent, I realized the maternal Grandmother is also sort of British. It doesn't matter anyway, Mills is too cute. I really love Keith because he brought a realistic sense of humor as the flabbergasted Dad who just wants to remarry with some young broad and pretend he's moving on with his life!!! O'Hara is also more than a pretty face. She's hilarious. This film is colorful, fun and just sexy enough not to be boring to adults. I love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An endearing comedy with two enchanting Hayley Mills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Parent Trap is a wonderful Walt Disney comedy. It allows us to benefit (in part thanks to the then revolutionary "split screen" technique) from a great performance by two Hayley Mills instead of one! The story of twin sisters discovering each other at a summer camp and trying to rebuild their "broken home" is very endearing. Yet, the emotion is well balanced with refreshing humor and quid pro quo situations. The cast is superb and it is worth mentioning the magnificent acting by the ever beautiful Maureen O'Hara and masculine Brian Keith. There is also a great appearance by Hitchcockien Leo G. Carroll in the role of a really funny Reverend. Still, center stage is Hayley Mills, 15 years old when the film was released, always funny, witty and really enchanting. Eventually, looking back at it now, The Parent Trap also, in my opinion, send us a feeling of nostalgia, like a frozen time capsule of the early 1960's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A double dose of Hayley Mills in an exceptional Disney gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***plot synopsis in this review***Once upon a time, before there were Barefoot Executives, Computers Wearing Tennis Shoes, Strongest Men In The World, World's Greatest Athletes, and Invisible College Students, there was a studio named Disney that believed in making good live action family motion pictures. They made gems like 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, Old Yeller, Pollyanna, Mary Poppins and this little gem called The Parent Trap.Not only do we get Hayley Mills playing dual roles with perfection, we get a great script by David Swift (who also wrote the script for Pollyanna and directed both films) that draws us in right from the opening credits (despite a somewhat obnoxious theme song vocalized by Tommy Sands and Annette Funicello). Add to this one of the best supporting casts Walt could possibly have assembled, and you have two hours plus of rollicking entertainment.When Hayley is on the screen with herself, the effect is uncanny, and you almost believe there are two Haley Mills. These scenes are mixed with others where she interacts with a double, (the uncredited Susan Henning) and the combination works, due in large part to Ub Iwerks who came up with the special photgraphic effects to make it all possible. Remember, in 1961 there was no such thing as digital effects so this was a tremendous undertaking for it's time, not having been done to this extent before.You should know the story by now but briefly, it centers around two girls, Sharon and Susan, who end up in the same summer camp and discover that they are identical twins who were separated from each other when their parents divorced, each parent taking custody of one of the twin girls. The rest of the movie centers on them changing identities, not only to meet the other parent, but in a wild scheme to get the parents (played by Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith) back together again. Okay, so it is all far-fetched but it is far-fetched hilarity.Besides Hayley's performance, Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara are great also, with Brian Keith never being funnier as the father who always seems to be getting the worst part of everything. Add to this a possible future step-monster played by Joanna Barnes, and Leo G. Carroll in a small but unforgettable role as a preacher, how could you go wrong? Even if you don't like this type of film, it's worth a look to see it at least once in your life.This movie was remade in 1998 with Lindsay Lohan, Dennis Quaid, and Natassia Richardson. The update is equally fun, which just goes to show what a good idea they had in the first place.If I have a complaint it's not with the movie but with the Disney Studios. This is one of their films that was given first class treatment on DVD, one of the best I have purchased. What makes this so maddening is that they can release a great DVD like this one minute, then rush out bad DVD transfers on fine films like Moonspinners and The Journey of Natty Gann. I'm not asking that they release every film in a special two disc edition, but there is absolutely no excuse why they can't at least make a decent video transfer of some of their other films. Just getting a decent copy of the films would be enough. It's frustrating.Till Next Time, Next Class Please</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still my favorite movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Parent Trap was the first movie I ever owned on video. It was one of my mom's favorites when she was young, and I rented it so often that it was cheaper for my parents to buy it, even at it's original video price of $79.99. I know the movie line by line, because it's one that you can watch over, and over, without tiring of it. I must have seen the movie six times before I realized Hayley Mills was playing both girls. (I was young at the time.) She does a superb job of bringing life to both Susan Evers and Sharon McKendrick. I highly recommend this movie for anyone, children and adults alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My first exposure to this movie was seeing previews on TV. My response was along the lines of "What a stupid, silly, comedy; I'm not going to go see that movie". Soon thereafter, my parents and I visited for a week with relatives in another city. One day they took us to see; you guessed it; "The Parent Trap". Fortunately, I was open-minded enough to pay attention to it. I discovered that, instead of stupid and silly, the comedy was clever, original, and most of all, very funny. And, of course, I fell in love with Hayley Mills. She was so much more spunky and feisty than any girl I knew. I loved that line "We submarined her". Then there was that darling face with, still to this day, the cutest nose I have ever seen.I've had the video for years and watch it fairly often. Being nearly 40 years older now, I find Maureen O'Hara as the real beauty of that movie. And my favorite scenes now are those near the end where she and Brian Keith realize that they need to get back together again.But Hayley still does, and always will, occupy a small corner of my heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderful movie! It takes great acting talent to pull off a duel role, but Hayley Mills has it! A role like this can't be easy, esp. when she sings "Let's get together". What is more remarkable however, is her ability to play two different &amp; distinct characters!The two are certainly VERY different! Sharon lives in Boston, who plays the piano and (Curiously enough)her life is controlled by her Grandmother! High society type. Susan on the other hand lives in California with her father, free spirit, goes camping, mountain climbing, Ect.The two meet at summer camp-at first they have a rivalry-as a punishment for fighting, they are forced to stay together in the same cabin, room together, eat together and play together. Over time, they begin to talk and discover that they are sisters. Susan has a fantastic idea.......switch places!!!!!! she has a plan.They enact on a plan-Susan goes to Boston to meet mother-and Sharon goes to California to meet her father. Easy Right??? Wrong!!!!It isn't long before they'll have to reveal who they are.But, hold every thing....Dad is engaged to be married Vickie who is 20 years younger than dad is! The sisters enact on a plan to separate Dad and Vickie. The wedding plans are further complicated when Susan and Mother go to California!Great fun!! ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reviewing much horror I felt I need to change my comment history a bit. This is a cute and totally wonderful Disney-classic with amazing Hayley Mills ("Pollyanna") in the leading roles as twins. She's one of the best child actors ever."Parent Trap" is a movie you can't dislike. Every family member will love it with its great story and acting. I saw this a couple of weeks ago and I really felt it should had been great if I had seen it when I was a child. Then it had been one of the best movie experiences in my life. It's so warm and friendly. I feel I wanted to live at that time, in the United States. Sometimes I feel that being young in the 1950-60's must have been great, even if I really like growing up in the 90's as well.I recommend this movie to everyone. You can't be anything else than happy afterwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies from my childhood. I loved watching the antics of the twins played by Hayley Mills and Hayley Mills, but you have to overlook a few issues and just enjoy the show. Typical of many Disney movies in the 50's and 60's, there are two separate plots. (So it could be turned into two TV episodes!) The first is a story about how separated twins meet at summer camp and switch places. The second story tells how they submarine their father's engagement and get their parents back together again. One of the most interesting things about the first part is the contrast between the proper Bostonian and the free spirit Californian and how they deal with their new, unfamiliar surroundings after they've switched places. (The scene where Sharon plays a classical piano piece, switching quickly to chopsticks when her father finally notices that she's never been able to play before, is too, too funny, but unfortunately was usually cut out in versions that had to fit into 2 TV hours.) That contrast disappears in the second part, however, and each twin acts like the other, even when they're not trying to fool their parents. (I would have expected Sharon to have screamed at the lizard sitting on the canteen.)I had always been puzzled why Mitch (Brian Keith) ever would have left Maggie (Maureen O'Hara) in the first place. And then, why would he ever be interested in snooty Vicky (Joanna Barnes)...and why he wouldn't have IMMEDIATELY dumped her for Maggie.But beyond these few puzzlers, it's a joy to watch. And oh yes, Ruth McDevitt is a hoot!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lighthearted Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two identical looking girls (both played by Hayley Mills) meet at a summer camp and they discover that they are twins. Their parents are divorced and they had decided to take custody of one girl each. They guess that since neither of their parents has remarried, they must still harbor feelings for each other. They each go to the other parent and plot to bring their parents together again. It is a simple story. The first half of the movie in very enjoyable. The scenes where the girls see their other parent for the first time are touching. But, the movie looses touch after the parents meet; it becomes noisy and meandering. There is an unnecessary plot-line of the father's (Brian Keith) engagement to a generic, gold-digging, young woman and the girls trying to get rid of her. Maureen O'Hara, as the mother, easily steals the show with her wit, grace and beauty. There are many good, well-acted supporting characters like the girls maternal grandparents, the sharp nanny and the flirty Reverend. The girls' personalities are well-written. The father gets the tomboy and the mother gets the more feminine daughter. But, Hayley Mills rather fails to bring the differences to life. She gives the same performance for both the characters but somewhat makes it up with her liveliness. It has good nostalgic value but does not really stand up if you are watching for the first time in 2010's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>still doesn't beat the original 1961 version *possible spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>one of Disney's all time favourite classics and beloved by many of all different ages. Hayley mills who quickly rose to stardom and recognition for her superb choice of roles shined in this family dramedy after twin sisters separated at birth after their parents divorce who took one girl each at birth. they would meet years later as teens at a summer camp not knowing the other existed. what ensues is hilarity at every corner and classic slapstick and physical comedy. mills is the perfect choice for the role as if she were born to play it and the added touch is her fun song performance mid-way through the film. i thought the film was perfectly cast and there was just great chemistry between all the actors. it's also nice to see that Maggie was portrayed as a fiercely independent and fiery individual who didn't take nonsense from anyone and stood up for herself. the script was expertly written without the story being overly sappy or melodramatic. plus there weren't any points where it dragged for too long or bored the audience. i didn't much care for the sequels that followed which also starred Hayley mills but as and adult. i recently saw the remake starring Lindsay lohan and it doesn't do it justice. you can't beat the original as it's always the first one you see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an identical twin who was born the year this film came out, it for obvious reasons holds a special place in my heart. I remember watching it on TV as a little girl with my identical twin sister and we loved every minute of it! We could obviously relate to the incredibly close (yet at times frustrating) bond shared by Sharon and Susan, played by the delightful Hayley Mills. I don't think that you have to be a twin to have fun with this movie. It is a delight on all levels.Maureen O'Hara (at the height of her great beauty in this film) and the ruggedly handsome Brian Keith are perfectly cast in their roles as the twins divorced parents. A great cast of supporting players that include Charles Ruggles, Una Merkel, Joanna Barnes and Leo G. Carroll just add to the talent that went into making this picture. They just don't make movies like this anymore, family movies that are great for everyone to watch without being overly sappy or dull. It makes me long for the good old days.For a fun family movie night don't waste your time on the remake with Lindsey Lohan. Rent this little gem, pop some popcorn and curl up with your kids and have a good laugh. They'll enjoy it as much as you will!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This touching classic is my favorite movie of all time. My parents divorced when I was very young and I had a sister less than a year older than myself. My biological mother was Irish and from the Cape Cod area of Mass, also my father moved to California as in the film. The movie is flawless in its depiction of a child's desire to get the family back together with the affection and belonging that ensues. Haley Mills, the "other" twin (I believe her name was Susan), Bryan Keith, Maureen Ohara, Leo G. Carroll as well as all the rest could not have done a better or more convincing job.

		<shortDescription>Mischievous, lively, &amp; fun twin antics, but a bizarre premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always been a huge fan of Hayley Mills and grew up with her in this type of movie. Like everyone else, I always just figured it was cute and heartwarming, then got to thinking...and I see at least one other reviewer agrees with me.This Disney family classic tells the story of two twins, Susan and Sharon, whose parents divorced shortly after their birth. Each parent assumed custody of one of their daughters, so these twins have been unaware they have a sister. However, the pair inadvertently meet at summer camp, recognize each other (of course, they're identical), and decide to switch places by going to live for awhile with the opposite parent. Then the scheming but appealing duo embarks upon a mission to reunite their divorced parents, despite the fact that the father is now engaged to another (rather nasty and not at all suitable) woman.First, Hayley Mills is of course an absolutely fabulous little actress here, playing the dual roles of the sisters, Sharon and Susan. She's bubbly, perky, endearing, charming, and all the rest of it, plus makes you believe there really are two different girls. Also, the parents are well cast, with the rugged Brian Keith portraying the father and the beautiful, sophisticated Maureen O'Hara as the mother.However, I agree totally with another reviewer that questions...what kind of strange, cruel, uncaring parents would split up their kids like this? Talk about dividing assets! It seems these twins have essentially no contact or awareness of the non custodial parent, in addition to being quite oblivious that they have a twin sibling. Furthermore, it is incredible that these parents seem to want no contact with their non custodial child. Such a parent does not come across as very heartwarming to me, even if played by Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara! Thus, the basic premise behind this tale is beyond bizarre. Of course the cute antics of the twins get the parents back together in the end. If this estranged couple is so easily reunited, one wonders why they ever divorced in the first place. However, I could forgive this...we all want a happily ever after ending here...but not the splitting up your children in infancy business.Anyway, it's a lively, light hearted, entertaining little movie that's fun to watch, lots of mischievous pranks and so on. But as for a 'family film', it has some strange messages. Parents should discuss some of these issues with their own kids while watching it, whether or not they themselves are in a divorced situation. My own child did not grow up with divorced parents, but I would still have wanted to make it plain...this is Disney and makes a cute story, but dividing up your children like this, denying them knowledge of their sibling or noncustodial parent isn't remotely acceptable in real life.As far as the new 1998 version is concerned, this 1961 Hayley Mills one is a classic and perfectly fine just the way it is. Why must Hollywood always feel compelled to do remakes? It's like they don't believe modern audiences can relate if the hairstyles or whatever are a little different. Absurd!</fullReview>

David Swift did an excellent job with the script and direction. This is just an all around, cute, interesting and enjoyable movie. Hayley Mills was just awesome as was the rest of the cast. One flaw, though, is the English accent Hayley falls in and out of, but it's such a minor flaw that most people would either not notice or not care. It would have helped for Sharon to be from London (like the remake) instead of Boston. This film also displays beautiful homes and scenery. You can't help but truly care about the outcome of this film, even if it is a little predictable. I recommend this classic film, if family movies are your thing.</fullReview>

Most important to me is the fact that it stays a light movie with good characterization and fine dialogue.However, at over two hours this is way too long for a comedy. The prologue at the camp where the girls meet sets the pedestrian (family?) rhythm. Then, there are very few twists and turns but each are stretched for long sequences.Had the movie been any less good on other accounts - cast &amp; characters, dialogue, settings and production values at large - it would surely look tedious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The parent trap based on the book is about a girl named Susan becoming the rival of Sharon while at summer camp. What makes its odd is both girls look identical, know stories about the other's parent and find out they have been separated by divorce.This time played by Haley Mills, a gifted young address who made this into a box office success and launched her acting career. The fabulous Marean O'Hara and Brian Keith were a delight as the kooky parents to the twins playing off one another anytime they're on screen.The humor was refreshing as its in the arguments the couple has, the twins pranks or fight at camp and the side characters shenanigans making it a memorable experience. I never laughed so hard in a long time.It does drag in places after an exciting first hour as the twins perform a musical number only to eat up screen time and many scenes are spent talking repetitively about the same problems through out.The new love interest wasn't as evil or conniving as the 90s version Mar and made you think how good ole dad couldn't see right through the charade sooner.Another flaw was the slit screen was kinda obvious in certain scenes taking the realism out of focus for a few moments at a time.Still it was a nice way to see a nice, clean, relaxing film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... is anybody else but me disturbed by the entire premise? Two people divorce, for reasons never spoken in the film, and they literally divide the child in half ala Solomon. One baby of their identical twin girls goes to dad (Brian Keith), and the other to mom (Maureen O'Hara). Not only in the first ten odd years of their lives does neither parent ever see (you don't know if they inquire via the other parent) the other child, they deny to both children the knowledge that they have a sibling! What judge would sign off on this deal? Wouldn't grandparents intervene or try to sneak a peak at the other grandchild in all of this time? Disney seems to have created a world where none of these questions are asked and the parents are free to write up any child custody agreements they care to arrange in a vacuum.Into this rather bizarre arrangement comes a summer camp to mess everything up. The two children end up at the same camp at the same time! Again, big screw up by the parents. One has been raised in upper crust Boston, the other on a ranch in Monterrey. Thus they have nothing in common but their looks. They cause trouble for each other with their pranks, until things escalate to the point that they are punished by being forced to live together in the same cabin in the woods. There they figure out they are sisters. So, now that they are each curious about their other parent, they decide turnabout is fair play and go back home to the parent they have never seen with each masquerading as the other.The thing that upends their plans is that dad is getting ready to remarry. Now every synopsis I have seen describes bride-to-be Vicki as a golddigger, but let's face it. It's not like Gerry Hall is marrying Rupert Murdock here. Dad is not that rich and not that old. He could live a long time and he could go broke. It was just a plot device to get the girls to reveal their switcheroo and thus get mom to fly to California and get the parents talking again, and to have an excuse for the girls not to like their stepmother to be, whose only problem seems to be that she is just not the outdoors type to be living on a ranch. And let's face it, the girls wouldn't like their new stepmom if she was Mary Poppins because she would be busting up their dreams of a reunified family.So how does this end? I'll let you watch and find out. I will say in the film's defense that it has a great two-tiered script with slapstick and adolescent humor for the kids and plenty of whimsy for the adults. The sentiment is genuine and not saccharine and the veterans in the cast give it plenty of gravitas, and kudos to Hayley Mills for making me forget that I wasn't looking at two different little girls. Just don't THINK too hard, because it ruins everything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This version of The Parent Trap is far superior to the remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first heard of this movie when I was a very little kid and I grew up with a Disney Sing Along video that contained a song from it called "Let's Get Together", so when I was eight years old I was motivated to try out the full movie and my family and I rented the movie from our library. That was my first time watching it from start to finish, and ever since then I also rented it from my library again in 4th grade and on Netflix in 9th grade. From the moment I watched this comedy in 9th grade, I've always though to myself "Wow, what a great film this is!", and to this day I own the movie on DVD and there are many things I love about it. First off, I love the beautiful scenery of Camp Inch where the twins in the movie meet in the beginning, as well as Sharon McKendrick's beautiful mansion in Boston and Susan Evers' Spanish architecture house in Monterrey, California. What I thought of the acting was that Hayley Mills definitely aced playing the roles of the twins (whose names I mentioned earlier in my review), as well as the beautiful Hollywood actress Maureen O'Hara playing the role of Maggie McKendrick twenty years after her most acclaimed role, Angharad Morgan in the hit John Ford film "How Green Was My Valley". In my opinion, Mills played the role of the twins much better than Lindsay Lohan did in the new version of The Parent Trap. In addition to all the phenomenal filming and acting of this hit movie, I also love the music that the Sherman Brothers wrote like the pretty song "For Now For Always", and "Let's Get Together" (of course). If anyone is looking for a funny film to watch that combines phenomenal acting and engaging music, I recommend you check out this movie and definitely skip the remake of it with Lindsay Lohan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightfull Hayley Mills, not a convincing plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love the pranks the twins played on each other, Hayley Mills gave a lovely musical performance towards the end, and it's also amusing to see her throwing a tantrum. So much for the "trap", the "parent" part though, is pretty horrible. Their dad seems to be the worst dad on earth, probably the worst man too. How can any man not fall in love with MAUREEN O HARA the first time he sees her(after 13 years)?? She has to actually get out of her way to trick them to break their engagement?? And for a man who abandoned her and separated her from her child years ago (I assumed), let her kid be slapped by a stranger and did nothing about it, not to mention he's barely handsome and has no personality what so ever at all. That's just ridiculous. She should have been still mad at him, and he had too crawl on his knees to win her back. Actually she and the kids deserve better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vicki exclaims, "Are you inferring that I'd marry your father for his money?" "If the shoe fits, wear it," responds Sharon.The Parent Trap, filmed in 1961, is about twin girls that meet each other at a summer camp. The girls do not get along because they look like each other (as weird as that sounds) and get in trouble because of the games and pranks that cause mischief. The girls get sent into the same cabin as punishment. They have to learn how to work together for the rest of the summer camp. One day Susan and Sharon decide to converse with each other. They share information about where they are from, and things they like to do. Sharon shares that she lives with her mom, and Susan shares that she lives alone with her dad. After a few more comparisons, they realize that they are long lost twins. Sharon and Susan use the rest of the summer camp to get to know each other and their families. Sharon cuts her hair the same as Susan because they decide to switch places. Sharon takes Susan's place at home, and Susan takes Sharon's place. Sharon meets her father, Mitch, for the first time and comes to realize that her father is in love with another young lady named Vicki. Vicki wants to marry the twins' father because of his wealth. Sharon calls Susan and begs her to bring their mother to California so she can stop the wedding. Susan and her mother fly out to California so they can get this confusion resolved. Sharon and Susan plan to destroy their father's wedding plans. Sharon and Susan set up romantic dinners for their mother and father. Sharon and Susan's mother, Maggie, meets Vicki, she does her best to embarrass Mitch. Maggie does not want Mitch to get married to Vicki because she secretly still loves Mitch. Sharon and Susan do everything they can to stop all wedding plans with Mitch and Vicki. The family plans a camping trip and Vicki throws a fit. Vicki does not want Maggie to come because she is the 'ex-wife'. Sharon and Susan are disappointed when they found out that their mother will not be coming on the camping trip. They plan to prank Vicki on the camping trip because they know how much Vicki does not enjoy the outdoors. Vicki did not enjoy the camping trip with Mitch and the girls because of the pranks Sharon and Susan pull. Sharon and Susan had lots of practice at summer camp, so they were pros at pranking Vicki, and getting her to not like the girls. Sharon and Susan gained up on Vicki to make her leave. Vicki called off the wedding because she was fed up with the girls. Mitch, of course, picked his girls over Vicki. Maggie was secretly overjoyed with this news when they came home from camping. Mitch and Maggie end up falling in love for the second time. Sharon and Susan could finally live together without switching places.The climax of the movie is when Susan and Sharon find out that Mitch is wanting to get remarried to Vicki. The movie now has a problem, and it's now the screenwriter's job to come up with a solution. The girls tell their mother, Maggie, and she is not thrilled about the news. The screenwriter uses Maggie to notice the problem and fix it. Maggie drops little hints in the movie to show that she is still interested in Mitch. Does Mitch recognize those hints?Mitch does not recognize that Maggie still loves him. Mitch has to figure out if Vicki is the right person to marry, or if he truly loves Maggie. It was made clearly that Maggie has already made up her mind, and goes to visit Mitch to win his heart back. Susan and Sharon have decided that once they get their parents back together, they can live together and not have to travel to see each other. Susan and Sharon think that this is the answer to the problem. The twins don't know that getting back together after a divorce is not an easy thing. Mitch and Maggie would have to work out all sorts of problems to get it to work, and what if they don't really love each other? Susan and Sharon were very lucky because it works out for them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie The Parent Trap starts off with your main characters Susan Evers and Sharon McKendrick. You first meet the two girls at a summer camp. From the most they set eyes on each other they hate each other, it might have been because they look so much alike. After pulling several pranks on each other the girls end up stuck in a cabin together! One stormy day they start to talk to each other and find out that Sharon only has a Mom and Susan only has a Dad! They put it together that they are twin sisters! They decide to switch lives so they can meet there other parent. They then try and pull there parents back together.The Parent Trap was a very family friendly movie. There were several times to laugh during the movie, but it definitely had a deeper meaning. This is definitely a movie to watch with the whole family. It was a very interesting story, that kept you not wanting to see it end. It is nice to know that they are bringing their family back together. It really shows the importance of having families together helping each other. I would definitely give this movie a good rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dated but enjoyable look at the remake's roots.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>California girl Susan Evers &amp; Bostonian girl Sharon McKendrick (Mills, both) meet each other at summer camp and realize they're twins and their divorced parents are the same, so in the hope of them and their parents staying together, they devise a plan to switch places and try to bring them back in love again. However, Mr. Evers's (Keith) new fiancée Vicky (Robinson) may prevent that from happening. Considering the required contributions Mills had to bring to this part, she's perfect at it; she's got the comedic timing down, especially during some sweetly awkward conversations between her parents, and she injects plenty of spirit into an otherwise mediocre role. As for O'Hara &amp; Keith, their chemistry combined with their strong representation of the nitty-gritty in grown-up relationships is also what makes the film shine. Separate them, however, and Keith turns into quite the unlikable parent; it's hard to tell whether to blame the writer (Swift) or the actor, but it's simply a role that could've gone into someone else's more energetic hands. I can only imagine the challenge it took for the filmmakers to make two Hayleys in one shot, but when invisible lines aren't the solution, they turn to backwards angles and shots involving either fast pace or natural shadow...clever work there, Swift. Although I prefer the 1998 remake, this original version of The Parent Trap is an overall enjoyable look at the roots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is one that a lot of people can identify with if they come from a divorced family with two loving parents and you want them back together again. Sometimes one or both of your parents will have a new romantic interest that you are not crazy about and want to get rid of them like the character Vicky Robinson (Joanna Barnes). So what are the kids to do? The thing to do is to trap both of your parents - trick them into getting back together! And that is exactly what Susan and Sharon (both played by Hayley Mills) plans to do - Parent Trap! This is a great family comedy film that is fun for all ages. A good movie to watch on a boring Saturday morning.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Parent Trap is, I think, one of the best family films ever made, and one of the best ones from Disney - having that pure, magical Disney touch. This fun story tells about teenage twin girls Sharon and Susan, who met for the first time at summer camp. Concocting a plan, they decide to swap places and try to bring their divorced parents back together.Though is movie is over two hours long, every moment in the film is intriguing and captivating, which captured my attention and I was not left bored at any time during the movie, from the twins concocting plans and course of events to reunite their parents to forest scene where the twins unleash of bag of tricks on the film's antagonist. The acting was great and I especially like the performances of Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara as Mitch and Margaret; they had excellent on-screen chemistry. Hayley Mills did a great job portraying both Sharon and Susan; I enjoyed watching the parts where they first found out they were long lost twins and how they adopted each others personalities when they decided to switch places to visit each other's parents. And, I loved Joanna Barnes' portrayal of the golddigger Vicki Robinson - charming, yet devious and hilariously crafty.The filming locations in the movie were breathtaking, from the elegant house of Margaret to the vast and magnificent ranch home of Mitch. And, the songs were quite catchy to listen to, especially the "Let's Get Together" number.Terrific movie for the entire family - full of laughs, surprises and fun.Grade A</fullReview>

Brian Keith is always a terrific actor &amp; playing dad seems so natural for him as he does it again in Family Affair on CBS later. Maureen O'Hara is a great mom &amp; it is difficult to every think of a film she was in that she wasn't good.Not only is this movie good entertainment, but the story is done at a leisurely pace which allows for most possible comic effect &amp; also for most touching emotional strings as this film has a heart of gold to go with the comedy.In support, lets not forget Nancy Kulp (Miss Jane on the Beverly Hillbillies) &amp; Leo G Carroll (TV's Topper &amp; in Man From UNCLE) who provide some of the mass talent in this particular Disney film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I re-watched The Parent Trap last weekend (watching Polyanna right now) and got to remember just how wonderful Disney movies were in the 50's and 60's. I know movie making and styles have changed, but our kids need to see the wonderful old movies full of love, caring, fun, humor and respect. They are great movies.The Parent Trap is heart warming and so revolutionary in its time of making. The split screen was so new but beautifully done. I like that they only used Lohan in the remake (holding true to the original) - which I think is quite well done, but it's not as good as the original.This is a great movie that should be revived and shown to kids - along with Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Polyanna, etc. It shows a lost time in movie making. Even Disney doesn't make movies like this anymore, which is a shame.Watch this wonderful movie and watch it with your kids, you will all appreciate it as we did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A Superb Gem"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Swift's directing must be the magic of the original (1961) "The Parent Trap", because both the 1961 and 1998 movies had excellent casts with for the most part the same story line, but the original is far far better than the 1998 version. Although I enjoy watching the 1998 version for what it is, I become totally absorbed into the original 1961 production for it seems effortlessly natural and realistic where as the 1998 production seems totally contrived. I cannot even give the 1998 version a pass for being contrived as a parody of the original. Naturally the styles from 1961 look a bit dated today but the entire original film is a superb gem. I hope you equally enjoy it should you have the opportunity to view the original 1961 production of Walt Disney's "The Parent Trap".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Parent Trap, with Hayley Mills is one of the best movies Disney ever made. It has held up through time b/c it is a classically themed movie.Hayley Mills is a very talented child actress who more than holds her own in this movie. Despite being made in 1961, the magic of making Hayley a "twin" holds up well. I think that the first half of the movie, where the twins are at camp is way too long. It could have been cut by two thirds. It drags on for so long and all the viewer awaits is for when they switch places.Finally the switch takes place and the fun begins. I love Charles Ruggles as the grandfather! But the movie would have been far better without the awful grandmother character.Maureen O'Hara as Margaret McKendrick is perfect casting. A fiery, Boston beauty and she is more than a match for Mitch.Brian Keith, as Mitch Evers is great casting too. He is wonderful as the rugged, no nonsense father. Joanna Barnes is a perfect villain as the gold digging fiancée.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a mad crush on Hayley Mills when I was a kid. I don't know what it was about her...I think it might have been that English accent. Whatever, I absolutely adored her and THE PARENT TRAP was probably my favorite Hayley film where she played twins separated as babies by their divorced parents who meet at summer camp, figure out what their parents did, and plot to get them back together. I recently viewed this Disney classic again for the 25th or 30th time a couple of months ago and still found it supremely entertaining. Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara are wonderful as the parents and Joanna Barnes makes her presence known as Keith's bitchy new fiancée, Vicky Robinson. Of course, it doesn't make sense that the father lives in California and the mother is from Boston and the twins spoke with English accents, or that nobody noticed, but I let that slide as a kid and I still do. A classic, anyway you slice it, forget the sequels and remakes and stick with the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Strictly Laugh Affair indeed! 123 Minutes of unfailing fun and merriment that certainly had ME laughing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About five hours and forty minutes ago from this moment, I finished watching "The Parent Trap" with my mother downstairs after just over two hours of playing time and we were extremely amused - to say the least! I feel so glad for recording the film on ITV1 just last Christmas or else I'd have missed out. Believe me now, if YOU haven't ever watched it you'd be missing out too. I have not seen the 1998-remake and my mum keeps telling me and telling me and telling me that she recommends that I see that film too and after an extent this irritates me and how can I if I can't find the video it was recorded on? I know she's only trying to help though and I am moved by her efforts.She does tell me that unlike most tatty, tired remakes that one is just as good if not BETTER than this original presentation of a novel which appears to be French. Neither of us could wait to watch the movie this afternoon and, after my stressful morning at college and mum's own stress from keeping everything in order with her poor bad back, it certainly lightened our hearts.To think that the technology even existed back then in the early 1960s to use such special camera effects that give the illusion of not only one but a pair of Hayley Mills for the purpose of bringing the twins and their plan that was simply fate to life.Some minutes after the overture, at the dance party at Camp Inch, that huge - and I mean HUGE - fight between the twin sisters at the dance, I think, was destined to show its audience just how rebellious, secretive and malicious those girls can be; after all, it's not everyday on such a special occasion as a dance party at a Summer Camp is ruined by merely two girls who are so angry with one another that they start up an enormous catfight, knocking stalls over, breaking record players, getting food absolutely everywhere and causing one heck of a mob and even getting the headmistress involved! My god, most kids I know wouldn't dare, they'd feel much too threatened! But I still think that all of that just adds to the comedy of it all; that shocking kind of behaviour, the malice of those two young girls triumphing over the discipline of any adult - strict or slushy alike - just adds to all the unstopping entertainment! But I completely agree with my amazing mum when she says it's sad for Vicky, Mitch's wife-to-be, being treated with such disrespect! It is not in the least bit fair for her and, answer this, is it HER fault that Margaret Evers changed back to Margaret McKendrick because Mitch divorced her? The answer is obvious.I imagine Disney wanted to make Vicky mean, bullying and selfish and she is all those - though to an extent - because for the most part, the reason she had such a bad temper was simply due to the fact that she'd reached the end of her tether with those kids and so from the point of the camping holiday, both I and my mother sympathize the long-suffering future bride completely and it's kinda sad how she forced herself to leave the man she loved because of the behaviour of his two girls. Even when she threw a tantrum just like the twin sisters in throwing pots and pans all over the place and hit the pair of them on her way out, we sympathize her and can't really blame her either.Still, we also kinda thought, "they're thinking, 'it was certainly worth that slap to get her out'" and, to tell the truth, I couldn't think of a much better ending; Vicky to a degree got exactly what she deserved because she was not the nicest person in the world but they still felt bad about tormenting her, made that known to their parents &amp; life turned out to be just as they originally planned. I, myself, have experienced the trauma of my parents divorcing one another at the minor age of 6 and I couldn't believe my dad was going to spend a most of every year yet to come abroad, away from his family and I know MY biological parents will not remarry ever again but I couldn't think of a better husband for my wonderful mother than the one she has now and the message to this comparison is that all families are different.At the end, one of the girls wakes up early in the morning and tells the other of a dream she just had... the second wedding of Mitch Evers and Margaret McKendrick in the garden of their house, all their friends and relatives attended and the twin sisters who are bridesmaids grin at each other as if to say, "we've done it! Our plans finally worked!" I highly recommend this outrageous, fun-filled, spirited two hours for those who feel they need a nice vacation from the contemporary action thrillers and horrors e.t.c and I think you may well find that the somewhat "sad" moments are not really sad at all - just endearing and sentimental that's all. The fun here is unfailing, take it from me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You already know this: this is great family fun. Get the gang together, throw a couple bags of popcorn in the wave, sit back and have a good time.The Big Surprise of "The Parent Trap" (1961) is that Maureen O'Hara is can be pretty unlikable through most of the picture. She's pretty much the same hellaciously feisty and fighting Irish witch that married John Wayne in "The Quiet Man" and who often only argued and fought with the poor guy.However, when she has her sane, loving moments with ex-hubby Brian Kieth, she lights up the screen and "The Parent Trap" blossoms.Bu of course, the film belongs to delightful little Haley Mills, who didn't stir any romantic feelings in me until three years later in Disney's "The Moon Spinners" which was her first romantic adolescent role when she fell for dashing young adventurer Peter McHenry and visa versa.In "The Parent Trap," Haley pulls of the minor miracle of playing to herself (delightfully) as twin sisters separated at age one, with each of them going to one divorced parent. IMPORTANT FUN NOTE: Of course, the fact that Haley's totally British accent is undisguised in two girls who have lived all their lives in the US (one in California, the other back east) is to be blissfully ignored.Vets Una Merkel, Charlie Ruggles, Nancy Kulp, the always wonderful Ruth McDevitt, loopy composer/band leader Frank "Happy Kyne" DeVol and Leo G. Carroll add a special zing to the festivities.And the knockout Joanna Barnes is a particularly nasty Harpy who manages to get herself engaged to Keith, much to the dire consternation of the twin Haley's and O'Hara. Will the engagement lead to marriage? Have fun: watch and see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not necessarily a good film for children to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film when it first came out in 1961, and I was young enough to have a crush on the immensely talented Hayley Mills. I can still enjoy watching it; however, I'm not sure it's an appropriate film for young children. There's nothing overtly inappropriate about its content--no violence, no rough language, no real sexual undertones. What I question is the film's none-too-subtle message about marriage and divorce. It may confuse children, especially children of divorced parents.The film begins with a bizarre premise: Hayley Mills plays identical twins who don't know of each other's existence until a chance encounter at a summer camp throws them together. Eventually, they discover that they are sisters. That moment of discovery can still bring a tear to my cynical old eye, but stop for a moment and consider just how bizarre the film's premise really is ...One sister has grown up with her father (Brian Keith) in California; the other with her mother (Maureen O'Hara) in Boston. Apparently separated shortly after birth, each not only has grown up unaware she has a sister, but each has had no contact with the other parent. How could that have happened? By all outward appearances, the parents are intelligent, caring, and responsible people. What horrible thing could have gone wrong in their marriage that caused them to cut off all contact with each other and to separate their daughters from each other and from their opposite parents?In one summer camp scene, the girl who lives with her father reveals to her about-to-be-discovered sister that she has a photograph of their mutual mother. How could she have that picture and not know that her mother is alive and well? For one reason only: Her parents have lied to both her and her sister throughout their entire lives. Who would do that their own children? How wonderful and caring do those parents look now?(Incidentally, this is fairly typical Disney fare. Have you ever noticed how many early Disney films are about children separated from their parents. Not just early Disney films, come to think of it. THE LION KING has an awful scene in which the lion cub sees his own father get killed. TARZAN, too, is about an orphan whose parents suffer horrible deaths.)Leaving aside the premise of THE PARENT TRAP, I must now object to the film's resolution: The girls reunite their parents by contriving to force them together in one place and then overwhelming them with cuteness--personified by the song, "Let's Get Together." The scheme works, of course, but why? If the parents are so wonderful and have always loved each so much, why did they divorce in the first place? Is there any reason to believe they have changed? And what is wrong with parents who would do what they have done to their own children?As I said, I can still enjoy this film--largely because of Hayley Mills's spunky performance--but allow young children to see this film? I have serious reservations. My own children were unfortunate in having to grow up with divorced parents. I never forbade them to see THE PARENT TRAP, but I took some care to steer them away from it.My children loved both their parents and would like to have seen us get back together, but it would have taken a lot more than singing "Let's Get Together" to make that happen. Watching that film when they were young could only have made them feel there was something wrong with them in not being able to match Hayley Mills's imaginary success. THE PARENT TRAP may be the worst kind of fantasy for children: a beautiful, dreamlike answer to heartbreak that could almost never happen in real life.Who benefits by putting such a dream into children's heads?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still good, but dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when Hayley Mills and I were much younger, and I remembered it fondly. Recently, however, I viewed the 1998 remake (see my IMDb comment on it), and I wanted to see the original again for comparison, which I now have done.It's hard to evaluate this movie on its own, as this is one of those, perhaps rare, instances wherein the remake is better than the original. Technology advances (and perhaps a bigger budget) aside, and without going into detail, let me merely observe that the remake reworks and updates this original, improving upon it in the process, most notably in characterizations, in certain casting for better chemistry, and in the script.Wherever there are scene-for-scene comparisons, more often than not I prefer those in the remake. By deleting several outdated scenes, situations, and attitudes, the remake was able to expand some of the better scenes from this movie. The extended trashing of the cabin near the beginning of the movie would be but one example -- they perform pranks in the 1998 version that we never would have thought of in 1961.One of the better scenes here, however hokey it may seem today, is when the twins perform a piano-guitar duet for their parents at the re-enactment dinner. (I don't recall Lindsay Lohan's musical talents being utilized at all in the later version.) Although I would continue to recommend this movie, if you can see only one, see the remake (as opposed to "The Parent Trap II," which is a made-for-TV dozer).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Divorce gets the Disney touch. Far-fetched plot is overcome by good performances by Hayley Mills, Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara. Still haven't figured out what kind of heartless parents could come up with a divorce settlement where twins are split, never to be paired again. In a brief musical interlude, Hayley predates the Beatles with a "yeah, yeah, yeah" line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, though the remake is even better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Parent Trap" just has one of the greatest plots for a family film ever. Hayley Mills was excellent in roles and pulled this off in a very funny way. She plays twins separated at birth who meet and camp and decide to switch places and meet the parent they've never seen, and try to get mom (Maureen O'Hara) and dad (Brian Keith) back together. The result is a film that is very entertaining, funny, and touching. There are tons of memorable scenes, such as the girls meeting, the song and dance ("Let's Get Together") scene, and the camping trip. The 1998 remake with Lindsay Lohan is even better and more touching, as this plot works even better for a family film today, in my opinion. However, this original is very funny and definitely worth watching. If you've only seen the remake, this version may seem dated at first. Watch it again; you'll be used to it and you'll start to enjoy it more. This is a classic live-action Disney movie, and young and old alike can enjoy it.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute Disney Fluff. However....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When people watch The Parent Trap, I wonder if they ever notice, like I have, a certain undercurrent of cruelty that even got past Walt Disney's watchful eye.If you didn't catch it, let me point it out: Mitch and Maggie Evers get divorced and decide to let an entire continent separate them. This is realistic so far. But their breakup is obviously so hostile and nasty that one takes Sharon, the other takes Susan, and mutually decide that neither twin shall ever know of their other sibling's existence.This is bad enough on its own. But to add icing to this inedible cake, Mitch and Maggie choose to forget about their other child at the other end of the country. Why inflict this on their girls? They didn't ask to be born, let alone cause the split.Okay, okay, I tend to look a little too close at this stuff today than when I was younger. After all, that is the plot, right? And the twins resolve this parental problem, right? And Disney would never end any movie on a sad note, right? Despite my observation, I enjoyed the rest of the movie. So go pop some popcorn and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's Get The Folks Together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking at The Parent Trap over 40 years from when I first saw it in the theater I can see why it was such a hit in more innocent times. It's cute and clever and certainly fulfills a wish fantasy about kids from a broken home longing to get their parents back together. Looking at it now though, I wonder if Walt Disney might have been perpetuating a bad fantasy on a generation.This was Hayley Mills's second film and third with Disney and in The Parent Trap she takes her Pollyanna, doubles it, and brings it up to the beginning of the New Frontier. She plays twins, separated at birth, each going to live with one parent and neither knowing of the other's existence. They meet at summer camp and switch places the better to get to know the part of their life they've missed. It works out well for the one who goes with Maureen O'Hara, but the one with Brian Keith discovers that Brian's head is being turned by a mercenary Joanna Barnes on the prowl whose mother reminds her about California's beautiful community property laws.This means getting Maureen from Boston to California and revealing all in an attempt to put mom and dad back together again.Maureen O'Hara made her one and only film with Disney with The Parent Trap and in her memoirs she and Walt quarreled because her contract specified first billing. She did not like Hayley Mills being first billed. But she decided not to pursue legal action as Walt threatened to blackball her. He was powerful enough to do it and did do it to a few people. She liked her co-stars though and was especially fond of Brian Keith. There are a lot of laughs in The Parent Trap with the girls first not liking each other in summer camp. And later on Joanna Barnes goes on the camping trip to hell courtesy of the Hayleys. I've got to say no matter what else happens they helped good old Brian dodge a bullet in the form of Joanna Moore.But you know how many kids in 1961 and later on Disney's prime time television program saw The Parent Trap and thought that too could plot a good scheme to bring divorced parents back? I wonder how many were disappointed in that way.Part of the bad side of The Magic Kingdom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>while i will say this movie is certainly family friendly,i didn't really like it all that much.i felt it was too long and slow.i think it could have been 30 minutes shorter without missing anything important.the acting is good,but i found the characters bland and uninteresting.Hayley Mills is is a decent enough actress,and it must be hard for one actor to play twins convincingly,which Mills does.but the movie is a bit too mellow for my tastes.I did like Maureen O'Hara as the mother.she stood out from the rest.Brian Keith was also good as the father.this is definitely a movie the whole family can watch.i did think it was a bit mellow,but to be fair there were a few fun scenes,and some catchy songs.my vote for The Parent trap is a 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes A Divorce Can Be a Good Thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No doubt as a penance for releasing scores of animated films without cogent family units, Disney released The Parent Trap; a Hayley Mills starring, anti-divorce film that had to have felt dated on arrival. In it, a set of estranged identical twins meet by sheer happenstance at camp, trade places, and attempt to bring their divorced parents back together again. The plot immediately appealed to me, even though I had seen the Lindsay Lohan remake. It's a story about the difficulties of preserving the family unit, the unfairness of divorce on young children and the implications of love when faced with the practicalities of life. So naturally Disney sidesteps such themes to make a film as fluffy and unnecessary as a feather boa.Okay, so maybe I'm exaggerating a little. The young Hayley Mills who had just started her Disney movie blitz is at her best as the likable twins Susan and Sharon. Both characters have personalities that are just developed enough to tell them apart but in case its too subtle one has a bad case of Long Island lockjaw. Their hijinks are fun, their humor agreeable and the end result is one of the more charming performances to come from a child actor.I'm actually quite concerned for these kids who have to deal with such narcissistic parents. Sure Disney glosses over the reasons why they got divorced in the first place but its easy to see their personalities are just too self-absorbed to be loving partners...or parents. If you're the proud parents of twins or triplets or sextuplets, you'd be able to narrow in on who's Justin and Dustin wouldn't you? That puzzle would be even less difficult if one of them had been a stranger to you for thirteen or so years but this all seems to be above their heads. Its only when one of the twins finally blurts out the truth that the families discover there's something rotten in the state of Massachusetts.The parents get even worse when they reunite and start exchanging rancorous chit-chat. The father (Brian Keith) you see is about to marry a much younger gold digger who, of course, exemplifies the evil stepmother trope we've all come to expect. So it only makes sense that the man's ex-wife (Maureen O'Hara) takes a trip to the coast, unannounced, totting one of two Machiavellian moppets, making catty comments, and dressing in the man's bathrobe. She then prances around the grounds while he's entertaining in a twisted game of hide-and-seek. Once they actually meet up, they of course argue until she literally punches him in the face in front of their kids! By that point, the couple was one mimosa away from "Thunderdome".If either of them were smart they'd get a restraining order against each other and shuttle both kids back and forth between California and Massachusetts. Not an idyllic solution, but its better than living with "The War of the Roses" (1988) 24/7. But alas they do stick it out together in the end because everything is supposed to be cheery, rosy and bright. It's a Disney movie after all; there are no tears in Disney movies! I just fear that kids with divorced parents will see this movie and want to imitate it which is kind of sad when you think about it. Its a hard lesson to learn kids, but sometimes a divorced household is better than one where one parent's in the morgue and the other in jail.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly and Overlong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Girls who look exactly like each other meet at a camp and take a ridiculously long time to figure out that they are twins. This silly comedy has some amusing moments but rambles on far too long, often becoming a drag. The whole premise of each parent taking a twin after divorce with no intention of ever meeting again seems preposterous. It is never explained why the twins speak with a British accent when they were born and brought up in the US. Did the filmmakers think that accent is genetic and was inherited from Irish (close enough to British) mom O'Hara? It is more likely that Mills was incapable of sporting an American accent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Home Alone, a Case of Child Abuse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with the abandonment of a child in Home Alone, there's the core issue of psychological abuse to children in Disney's The Parent Trap that, if thought through too thoroughly, one might get a colossal case of the slack-jawed amazements here.In the original and the remake, divorced parents split their twins and don't tell the children that they have a birth-mate. The bizarre cruelty of that act is the hook that makes the story work, but, in anything like real-life, Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara would/should be looking at legal action (we could only hope).And that's the only caustic thing I have to say about TPT.Okay, I lied. Hayley Mills has a voice that could peel paint, so the whole "Let's Get Together" pop song is excruciating. But The Parent Trap has solid comedic performances and a sweet, Disneyfied feel that makes me long for The Wonderful World of Disney on NBC Sunday nights.My suggestion is to buy a copy of the original and the remake (or look for a good, complete showing on Hallmark or Disney) before your little girl(s) get too old for them.And watch Keith, O'Hara, and Mills over and over until you're sick of the whole lot, and your daughters are just getting warmed up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this movie has a significance for the era in which my parents came of age, but it's not the significance that you were thinking of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the most part, I watched "The Parent Trap" just so that I could heckle it like Mike, Servo and Crow do the movies that Dr. Forrester and TV's Frank send them on "Mystery Science Theater 3000". I'm most proud of referring to the woman with the surname Robinson as the character in "The Graduate".But what this movie really represents is what was thought of as "acceptable" and "decent" entertainment. Before too long, the Beatles arrived, causing a torrent of movies and music that old-school people didn't consider "acceptable" or "decent". It got to the point where the "unacceptable" and "indecent" stuff got accepted as a general part of popular culture (good old parable of the leopards!). As in my parents' era, so in my era. "Acceptable" and "decent" culture used to be movies like "Home Alone", but soon it was "American Beauty".The point is, this is the sort of movie at which I roll my eyes. I see that there was a remake starring Lindsay Lohan. We all see what a wreck Lohan became.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Claptrap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Questionable Disney film with Hayley Mills playing 2 roles; twins whose existence was kept from the other due to an improbable and cold-hearted decision by their selfish, divorced parents played by a lovely Maureen O'Hara and a tubby Brian Keith who's notably lacking in warmth. Mills doesn't make the twins distinctive though the special effects are fine and unobtrusive. The big problem with the film is that the adults are childish and unappealing and Keith and O' Hara don't belong together and what brought them together in the first place remains a mystery. Pity Joanna Barnes who was so good in Auntie Mame (1958), she has a thankless role and has been prematurely aged by hairstyle, make-up and photography. The supporting cast made up of familiar faces is dull and David Swift's direction of this big screen sitcom is anything but swift.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This 1961 original must take a back seat to the remake with Lohan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put, young actors today are better, and modern filming and editing techniques are better. The stories in the two 'Parent Trap' movies are very similar. Identical twin teen girls separated at birth, one raised by her dad, the other by her mom, meet at camp, figure out who they are, plot to get mom and dad back together. A roadblock they must clear out is the younger woman planning to marry dad any day now. Haley Mills is cute and does a good job, but I find Linsey Lohan creating a much more interesting set of roles in the modern remake. Other differences. This original had mom and dad on opposite coasts of the US. The remake has them in California and England. In the original the twins are much more compliant while the parents have more 'edge' to their characters. It is the opposite in the modern remake.</fullReview>
