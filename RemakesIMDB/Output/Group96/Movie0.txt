		<shortDescription>Good character-driven human drama; I blame the teenagers for the low rating.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once more, a great injustice has been done by IMDb voters. Dark Water currently has a rating of 5.4, with 16% of the voters giving it a 1! Note that 16% is 251 users, so it's not that a lot of people thought it was bad, it just that not many people saw it and/or voted.It's quite obvious what happened. In what must be the most idiotic marketing move of the century, Dark Water was promoted as a horror movie. Not only is the original Japanese version not that scary to begin with, and focuses more on the drama and the human aspects of the story, but in the remake, the horror element completely gets thrown out the window in favor of an intelligent, mature human drama. I can say that 75% of the people who were with me in the theater had no idea what kind of movie this is going to be. Needless to say, about an hour into it they began shifting in their seats, chatting or giggling. Most of them were teenagers, who came looking for cheap thrills and got a "bore-fest" instead. The same kind of teenagers who, I bet, later voted it a 1.True, the movie could have been edited a little tighter, and some sequences could have been left on the editing room floor, but it's not boring. It does take its time establishing and developing the relationships and the characters, but since the movie is all about the characters, that's a good thing. It's quite an ambitious drama, and as such, it doesn't always strike home. The script, I think, is the main problem. Since it presents us with very real people with real problems, but doesn't seem to know where to take them from there. As a result, the plot is thin. It's certainly not an event-driven movie. It remains unclear what the main conflict is for the heroine. The writer wasn't fine tuned on what he wanted to say, or maybe the director, Walter Salles, mishandled the material. For me, the story was about learning to let go, and the difference between loving someone and wanting them to be happy, and loving someone so much that you want that person to belong only to you. It's the difference between being willing to sacrifice vs. a selfish and possessive kind of love. I think the movie should have put more weight on that.Other than that, the film does strike the right chords more often than not, and provides a lot of touching, sad moments. The acting is wonderful and three dimensional. All of the cast does an excellent job, but especially Jennifer Connelly, who proves once more she is the best American actress working today. The cinematography and the art design are beautiful, with a lot of attention to atmosphere. Also, Walter Salles shows some neat directing techniques in playing with the viewer's minds, making us doubt what's real and what's imaginary, and giving visual expression to the heroine's ever deteriorating state of mind.All in all, I'd rate this movie a 7.5. But 5.4?!!!! That's lower than Fantastic Four, for crying out loud. I just hope that it finds the right audience when it's released on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Teenagers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't know about you all, but I've sort of had it up to here with teenagers. Walter Salles' *Dark Water* flopped because of teenagers. The geniuses up the highway from me at the Walt Disney Company tried to market this psychological drama -- in SUMMER! -- to teenagers as a slasher film . . . OOPS. When the teenagers discovered that the film's primary concern was with a troubled single mother, fresh from a nasty divorce and currently embroiled in a custody fight, they lost patience with it (the screen offering no steaming entrails oozing from savagely slashed pregnant abdomens and such) and commenced downloading ring-tones from Katazo on their cellphones in the darkened theaters. The epilogue to the sorry saga of this film's release? The teenagers infest this website with their 1-star reviews and poor grammar and ALL CAPS SENTENCES. Look, I've got an idea: I think it's high time that the folks at IMDb create an entirely separate website -- let's call it "IMDbTeen" -- in which the children can vent their spleen and leave THIS site for the rest of us to discuss movies. And no, banishing the youngsters to the discussion boards won't cut the mustard -- the Ritalin-addicted kids, thumbs sore from their PSPs, have obviously found their way to the review pages. Or perhaps IMDb, which is owned by Amazon, can follow their corporate parent's lead and force teenagers to identify themselves as such -- the rest of us can then ignore their comments.Pardon the W.C. Fields rant, but *Dark Water* is too good a film to be hijacked by walking pimple sacks, sorry. Here is a great work of art that has been virtually disowned by its director because of the poor box office returns. Hey, Salles, if you're reading this, there's no reason for you to hang your head in shame over this picture. I, for one, appreciated your baroque homage to Polanski's *Repulsion*, and can even state that the performance you get out of Jennifer Connelly actually surpasses Deneuve's work in that earlier film. Connelly thoroughly inhabits the role -- an unglamorous one that asks this beautiful actress to dress in ratty clothes while suffering from constant migraines. She convinces us as a desperate case, both financially and emotionally, and also convinces us that Dahlia is an honest-to-goodness mom (Connelly has a couple of kids in real life, which not only helps, but is a necessity on an actress' resume if she presumes to play this part). And it's not just Connelly who scores in the acting department: John C. Reilly as the superintendent delivers an immortal monologue (mostly improvised, according to the DVD extras) as he offers Dahlia and her daughter a grand tour of the hideous housing project on Roosevelt Island that is the setting of the movie. "Where's the living room?" asks Dahlia. "This is it," effuses Reilly, "It's both bedroom AND living room! It's what they call a DUAL-USE room. Look at it -- it's huge!" Anyone who has ever dealt with a real estate agent will recognize Reilly's canny mix of friendliness and utter untrustworthiness. A-class talent such as Pete Postlethwaite and Tim Roth also make significant contributions as the building's janitor and Dahlia's lawyer, respectively.But the prime virtue of the film is in the photography and set design. *Dark Water* is that rarest of horror films: it's set in the city. Roosevelt Island, to be precise, that run-down spit of land across the river from Manhattan, encrusted with Soviet-bloc inspired tenement housing. ("The Brutalist style," as Reilly would have it.) Salles' DP has a field day in this environment, getting some nice aerial shots of the brick and cement rat maze, as well as some low shots pointing up toward the tenement towers' imposing height. The weather is usually rainy (the incessant leitmotiv of the film is water, obviously), the sky is gun-gray, smokestacks dominate the horizon, the overall color palette consists of institutional gray, poverty-row brown, icky black, depression blue. The interiors, specifically of Dahlia and Ceci's apartment -- along with the mysterious 10-F directly upstairs -- is a fond homage to Catherine Deneuve's greasy, miserable apartment in Polanski's *Repulsion*, with some nods thrown towards the Coens' *Barton Fink* along the way (especially in regards to the peeling plaster and moist dry-wall and overall dilapidation).But is *Dark Water* really scary? Presumably, this would be the point. It's probably not scary enough to scare the pimple sacks, but it's scary enough for those who've had to deal with life's most fundamental problems, such as raising a child alone, or finding oneself crippled by either physical or mental handicaps, aggravated by an unhappy past, WHILE raising a child alone. In other words, it's scary enough for grown-ups, who can find terror in watching their children cross a busy intersection. And in any case, Salles delivers a few choice jolts along the way, which I won't spoil. But the genius of the film is in its atmosphere: an unrelenting brooding menace that feeds off of urban misery. *Dark Water* is depressing and scary.And splendid. 9 ardent stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never posted a review on this site, but I feel that I should inform some people on "Dark Water".This is NOT a horror film.Yes,it's being marketed that way but it's not.This is a drama about a mother and daughter trying to make it on their own with a bit of a ghostly twist.Jennifer Connelly is amazing and has become one of my favorite actresses.In this,she is strong and fragile.She almost made me cry once or twice as she tried to hold things together and convince herself that she is not crazy.The little girl playing her daughter is sublime;The next dakota fanning maybe. This film is slow paced,there are NO big scares,no blood-just tension and mystery under the surface.The pace brings you to really care about the characters and not root for dahlia because it's Jennifer Connelly,but because it's Dahlia.It has one of the saddest yet hopeful endings I've seen in a while.This stands head and shoulders above "The Ring" (which I liked) and "The Grudge".Give it a try if you're looking for a good drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gives the original a nice dousing of reality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a "child talks to dead people" movie. You should rejoice. It's not a "woman fights supernatural forces" thriller. You should get down on your knees and thank the powers that be. This is not "just an unnecessary re-make of the Japanese original". It's better. Nakata is famous for taking the long view of his characters. Keeping us safe emotionally from them in order to bring the horror to life. Salles trumps him by pulling us right into Dahlia's arms where her fear, paranoia, and despair are absolutely palpable. This is the story of a single mother trying to survive after a nasty divorce. Trying to hold onto her daughter so she can overcome her own history of abandonment. The ghosts (whether real or imagined) are peripheral to her dilemma. The American Dark Water, gives us the same foreboding leak, the same bleak horrific photography, the same basic plot line, and yet by taking the emphasis off the ghosts reaches a much stronger emotional resonance. Highly recommended for those that submit themselves to movies, rather than submit movies to themselves. You know who you are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all about atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't be fooled: you're not going to go see a horror movie. You're going to immerse yourself into a strange, morbid atmosphere that will carry you through an intimate, beautifully filmed story where it's the atmosphere and the characters that count. Yes, there's a few horror elements, but they are a subtle, underlying subplot that does not interfere with the delicate, smooth direction of Walter Salles. Nothing in this film is meant to scare you, but rather to leave a sense of discomfort after you've seen it. A sense of paranoia, like the main character's. And Jennifer Connelly is absolutely fantastic here. Much stronger than the original: here, the characters are real, and Salles connect us to their turmoil right away. Reminiscent of a Henry James novel, where fear builds up in the background as you share more and more of the main character's feeling. In a word: sophisticated. Different. The only similar experiment of this kind of subtle fear, injected in your imagination as you watch the film, is an Italian short I saw at last year's Frighfest, entitled "Xchange". While you wait to be scared on screen, the story almost subliminally built horror in the audience's mind. A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark Water Has Depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the recent remakes of Japanese horror films, I have to say that Dark Water is the only remake that actually surpasses the original. I think the reason that so many people are so hard on it is because they went in expecting to see THE RING or THE GRUDGE. They went in expecting to see a scary ghost movie. Dark Water is not really a horror movie, at least not in the traditional sense. It's actually more of a drama set in a haunted apartment complex. If you go in expecting to have stuff jump out at you, you will be disappointed.It's sad that everyone expects horror films to have a bunch of jump scares in them these days. Whatever happened to the slow buildup of tension and paranoia of something like ROSEMARY'S BABY? If you go into Dark Water expecting something more akin to Rosemary's Baby or a Hitchcock thriller, you might just end up enjoying this film.As far as comparing this remake to the original, I will say that I felt that Jennifer Connelly was a much more compelling character than the mother in the original movie. Overall, the characters were fleshed out better. I understood the conflict between the mother, the father and the little girl much more in the remake. The original just sort of glanced over many of these details. Some of the shots were actually more effective than the ones in the original, and the ending in the remake is more satisfying and better executed than in the original. Generally, I think that J-horror is better left in its original incarnation. As much as I liked the Western version of THE RING, I felt like the only reason they remade it was to cast Naomi Watts as the lead. THE GRUDGE, they should have left that one alone. Nothing was gained by Sarah Michelle Gellar. But this one, this one is actually better than the Japanese original in my opinion.This movie is not for everyone. It is a slow, poignant drama set in a really creepy location. It would probably play well in a double feature with ROSEMARY'S BABY. If you want to have stuff jump out at you, watch THE GRUDGE. If you want to watch a movie that has a little more depth to it, watch DARK WATER.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent piece of psychological work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm at a loss to describe why so many people here have panned this movie. I can only suppose that those who didn't like it went to see this expecting a horror movie. And since no monsters jumped out and hacked people to death, I imagine teenagers (apparently the main demographic that posts here) were bored to death with it. They couldn't understand why there wasn't a mutilated corpse every half step. Their A.D.D.-addled brains couldn't sit still long enough to decipher the complex plot points or to appreciate good character-building (something sorely lacking from movies nowadays.) Comparing this movie to "The Ring" is like comparing "Godfather" to "Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer." The movies are in two completely separate genres.I blame the marketing department. The promos did make it look like a fright-fest. One might have expected ghosts to be flying around the room a la "Poltergeist." I suppose they must have assumed that those of us who like movies that actually engage us and make us think weren't a very big market. Instead, they chose to market it to the "slasher movie" ilk, and they, being simplistic, got headaches trying to sift through an actual PLOT. Then they went home to listen to their Korn CDs and smoke pot.Anyway, that being said, I approached the movie with all the preconceptions I just mentioned. And if you do have those preconceptions and are unwilling to give them up, the movie will drag on mercilessly for you. However, I switched modes quite easily, and became intrigued with the plot. It led me one way and then another, every time giving me something new to think about.Nobody can criticize the acting here, either. Jennifer Connelly is superb as always, but the young daughter is quite skilled as well, and I expect to see her more often in the future.I won't get into specifics, but the ending is something I really wasn't looking for.As I left the theater, all the adults (most of whom didn't know each other) were talking about what a great movie it was as we filed out the doors. The teenagers in the theater were too busy making out to notice the credits rolling.View if you're mature. If you're not, save yourself the brain-strain and go rent "Seed of Chucky" and leave the grown folks alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully made film which transcends the original source -- Connelly glows!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>New York City under the rain. The atmosphere of this film is so oppressive from the start that it sets the mood precisely. Things are not going well for beautiful, stressed Dahlia Williams (Jennifer Connelly). Her life has not been easy: abandonment, neglect, bitterness and mygraines. She left a career in book-editing to become a housewife and full-time mom. Her husband does not love her anymore. Her whole life is focused in her bright, charming six-year-old daughter, Cecilia. Right from the start, it becomes apparent that Dahlia is overdue for what may seem like a regular nervous breakdown, but when they move -- rather hastily- into a small, dingy apartment in Roosevelt Island, the tale slowly but surely unfolds to reveal something much more elaborate, sinister and ultimately heartbreaking going on.I have seen the original Japanese version, and liked it enormously. I think that gifted Brazilian auteur Walter Salles has done it justice: this is a film that is *not* your regular horror story. Its composition, as scripted by the talented and sensitive Rafael Yglesias is closer to the Henry James tradition of serene Gothic tales than to the strident antics of today's conception of horror (Ring, Ring 2, Boogeyman, The Grudge, etc.) In hindsight... this is NOT a horror movie. It's a beautifully made -- the photography by Affonso Beato is gorgeous in its use of light and dark- and stylized film. Angelo Badalamenti lends his talent to create a beautifully moving score that serves perfectly the ominous ambiance and also the touching moments.This is a film with a heart and it's notably well-directed by Salles. The actors are flawless: Dougray Scott is the father in turmoil, John C. Reilly a tactless but cheery real state agent, Pete Postlethwaite is strangely captivating as the curmudgeonly super and Tim Roth makes an impression as a sweet-natured, kindly and endearing lawyer (yes, DIVORCE LAWYER!)who literally works out of his car and who might or might not carry a torch for Dahlia, as he is pretty much on the doldrums himself.The little girl playing Cecilia, Ariel Gade, is impressive on her screen debut. It's hard for such a young actor to pull such a nuanced performance. She gives such prodigies as David Dorfman or Haley Joel Osment, a veritable run for their money. And then some.The real star here is Ms. Connelly. She is virtually in *every* scene, and that, for a performer is taxing. She carries the baggage of Dahlia with dignity and grace. She is a REAL woman in an ugly place at an ugly moment: you can see the brackets around her mouth, you can feel her anguish, impotence, horror at being on the verge of losing her mind or worse yet... being *driven* (perhaps) to the brink. Her scenes with little Miss Gade are touching, authentic and the core of the film. You come to care for them as mother-and-daughter.Jennifer Connelly makes this her movie and this is one of her best performances. Sadly, this will be overlooked for awards and it is a pity. She gives what some call a "bravura performance".This is great film. EVERYTHING that wretched American-made sequel to THE RING was not and tried desperately to be.It's elegant, moody, touching, moving and yes... disturbing and angst-inducing.The wait was worth it. Go see it with open eyes and no expectations. It even transcends the sensitivities of the original... this film is its own, and holds it rather well.Certainly, DARK WATER will be marketed as a scary film, which it is not. It's a mystery fable about life, death, pain, love, joy and sorrow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot more than a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen both the Japanese original and Walter Salles' remake i find the remake was the best thing that could happen to this story. Salles picks up the original story without making just a copy. He fills the gaps (and there were plenty), corrects a lot of little flaws and adds the credibility that was lacking in the original. The original was in parts a horror movie, and a very poor one so. Predictable behavior, foreseen turnings, forced mysteriousness - the usual problems i have with so many horror movies. The other part is a family drama, with a weird happy end. The happiness of which intrudes into the horror story and further degrades it. Salles goes more than a step further here by not making a simple horror movie. Rather he's making a stressful movie. Stress? The stresses of everyday life in a difficult situation. A recent divorce, fighting for the custody of the child, low budget, cheap noisy apartment with wet ceiling, trouble at school, no contact with neighbors, careless caretakers and managers. It's a context fueled by very real issues people are struggling with every day. The mysterious components only add to this and drive it, until they finally take over. Very dense atmosphere and Jennifer Connelly's excellent acting make you feel this stress. What more can you ask for?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly marketed incorrectly, but still a fantastic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I say anything more, I want to acknowledge that this is not a horror film. I'm not sure if it was even marketed that way, but it is not. It is more drama/psychological thriller. So, before commenting on how it is a bad horror film, please re-evaluate before slandering.On the film: This is one of my favorite films of the year. The acting by all characters is superb. Connelly plays the character of Dahlia to the tooth. Ariel Gade creates a strikingly, somewhat scary picture of a young Jennifer Connelly. (For now, I will stick with the two main characters) On the story: It is a story about a family being torn apart and the emotional instability of such effects. The supernatural portion of the story adds a feature one can only understand by watching the film. Connelly remarkably recreates scenes of insecurity and the pain of memory and also the pain of sacrifice.See this film, not only for the characterization created by all of the actors, but for excellent cinematography, emotional depth, and the score (created beautifully by one Angelo Badalamenti). Also, pick up Koji Suzuki and also see the original Japanese film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jennifer Connelly is amazing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether or not you'll like this movie depends on what type of movies you like. If you really expect a thriller, you're going to be disappointed. If you're watching the movie for Jennifer Connelly, then you'll enjoy it for her amazing acting as always and the lack of thrills won't bother you as much. She can turn a slow moving movie into one that actually holds your attention throughout. Her presence makes any movie that much more enjoyable.I'm not into the Japanese converted thriller/horror movies and enjoyed the fact that Dark Water was more interesting and plot developing than thrilling. I think Jennifer Connelly's an amazing actress, if anyone else stars in it - I would rate it a 1. Another HUGE plus is that the ending couldn't have tied up all the twists and pieces any better. Most of the time the ending makes the movie - in this case it helped the movie a lot. See the movie with an open mind or don't see it at all.Oh yea - the advertisement commercials couldn't have been more off for this movie. They completely skewed everyone's expectations of the movie and hence the low rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated and Effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amidst a messy divorce, a single mother (Jennifer Connelly) and her young daughter move into a new apartment complex with her young daughter, only to be plagued by water problems as a leak in their ceiling turns out to be something far more sinister and haunting.Dark Water is more of a thriller/family drama with some horror elements thrown in. If you're expecting something like The Ring or The Grudge then you will most likely end up disappointed. The film does have its share of suspenseful moments but the movie really focuses on the relationship between a mother and her daughter. When the film starts, its obvious that Dark Water is going to be a sad, depressing story because of the weather in the movie. Throughout most of the movie, its always raining or looking wet so it sets its mood early on and it keeps it the same throughout most of the film. The apartment building that they move into is also dark and creepy. It's in very bad shape and there are leaks everywhere so the setting adds more suspense.The acting is great and the cast really does make the film interesting. Jennifer Connelly is a terrific actress and she proves it again here. Ariel Gade plays the daughter and she does a pretty good job. She will most likely become a bigger star when she's older. The supporting characters are played by John C. Reilly, Camryn Manheim, Tim Roth and Dougray Scott. They all play their roles well and none of them slack off.Walter Salles is very good at building suspense and he moves the film along smoothly. He doesn't overpopulate the film with cheap scares or loud noises which was nice to see. The ending was strong and sad yet it's realistic because it shows how much she really cared for her daughter. It's also sad at the end of the movie when they reveal what happened to the other girl. It's sad to see a parent actually forget about his or her child and the ending is done effectively so. Dark Water is not a movie for the weak of heart. Those wanting a happy ending to the sad story should probably skip Dark Water. The pacing of the film is also a little on the slow side so if you're easily bored at slow dramas then watch something else. In the end, Dark Water is an effective thriller with strong performances and a creepy atmosphere. Those wanting a horror film should look elsewhere. Rating 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good character study with excellent acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Misleadingly advertised as a Ring/Grudge like horror film, this is actually a poignant, dark and ultimately compelling drama with supernatural elements added. Jennifer Connelly is excellent in this movie as a disturbed single mom who's trying to make the best life possible for her young daughter (Ariel Gade) with limited resources and while in the middle of a messy divorce. Moving into a creaky apartment building with plumbing problems, both are seemingly haunted by the spirit of a young girl, who may be a murder victim. And I won't reveal anything else about the story. While Connelly carries the movie on her own and gives what is probably the best female acting performance in a "horror" film since Kathy Bates in Misery, she's ably supported by the likes of John C. Reilly, Tim Roth, Camryn Manheim and other excellent character actors. CGI is only discreetly used here for the special effects. The script is very well thought out and the production values are excellent.I honestly blame the average rating (5.6 as of this writing) on teenagers who felt cheated by the false advertising. However, this is a film made for adults, not kids with short attention spans expecting decapitations, hacked off limbs and cheap jump scares every five minutes. If you are only wanting a bloody/exploitative horror film, don't watch this movie. If you want a mature psychological drama with good character development, excellent acting and a downbeat ending, you will probably enjoy Dark Water just as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film Noir with Panache</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter Salles has proved himself a formidable director with his successes in 'Central Station', Behind the Sun', and The Motorcycle Diaries': he is an artist unafraid to approach unfamiliar terrain in his growth as a director, yet always proving that the most important element in making a good film is to explore the characters more than just the atmosphere. Those who find faults with DARK WATER seem to be concentrating on critiques of special effects and manufactured terror machines. Where Salles succeeds in this adaptation of the original Japanese film by Kôji Suzuki (novel) and Hideo Nakata (director) is his concentration on developing interesting and strange people, characters with whom we can identify and thus whose encounters with the 'unknown' feel more intensely internal.The story has been related ad infinitum: Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) and her daughter Cecelia (Ariel Gade) move from Manhattan away from her recently estranged husband Kyle (Dougray Scott) to a creaky apartment building on Roosevelt Island to the benefit of real estate agent Mr. Murray (John C. Reilly) and under the suspicious eye of building super Veeck (Pete Postlethwaite). The building and the constant rain are ominous from the start but soon strange events happen that suggest either mental decline of both Dahlia and Ceci or the presence of ghosts. The title of the film describes not only the bleak atmospheric element that drives the story but also the netherworld that admixes surrealistic phenomena with psychosis. Characters enter the story naturally and comfortably: Jeff Platzer (Tim Roth) offers his legal defense of Dahlia in a manner that belies his mode of existence; Ceci's Teacher (Camryn Manheim) brings reality testing to the fuzzy world of imaginary friends; Alison Sealy-Smith as a supervisor where Dahlia seeks work is one of Dahlia's few kind encounters.Though the pacing seems slow it does march like the descent of a mind into the unknown and Salles manages that well. The film's cinematography by Affonso Beato maintains the grunge effect that intensifies the terror and Angelo Badalamenti has provided a musical score that bears just the right amount of supportive suspense. But as with other Salles movies the work is supported by truly fine acting and once again Jennifer Connelly proves she can convey much with very little. Give this film a chance, without comparisons to other films of the genre, and see what Walter Salles can do with a story. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good, thoughtful movie with a splendid central performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to be DRAGGED to the theater to sit through yet another HIDEO NAKATA-Japanes horror inspired movie. I'd suffered through the RING movies before and couldn't think I could stand this. But I was actually surprised. It's actually a GOOD FILM, very melancholy, and that a film of that sort -- which aspires and competes with mindless summer blockbusters a la FANTASTIC FOUR -- dared to tackle such somber issues as child abuse, bitter matrimonial feuds, and others of that sort shows you that this was not meant to be a simple succession of red-herrings stitched together. It actually dealt with issues many of us go through or have gone through in our lives and I thought it was very perceptive in some ways.The script (when not dealing with the supernatural) was thoughtful and intelligent and each and every characters from CAMRYN MANHEIM's kindly teacher to TIM ROTH's benevolent lawyers were very well sketched out. The direction and rich photography helped keep the tension high throughout.The bulk of praises, however, belongs to JENNIFER CONNELLY. I've always been in awe of her beauty and her talent, esp. in her last outings: REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, A BEAUTIFUL MIND (hated the movie, liked her AND RUSSELL), but here, she literally makes this movie worth sitting through by providing the necessary gravitas. I don't think I've been touched by a film character like this in a long while. She emoted so naturally and effortlessly, it was heartbreaking to watch her self-immolate in the prison that that new apartment of hers was.Not only is she beautiful, she's truly a marvelous actress. She did for this what NAOMI WATTS -- and I love NAOMI -- couldn't for the RING movies. I always sort of thought that NAOMI was going through the motions in those films. Also, the problem with the RING movies is that they suffered much in the "remaking" process and the scripts, quite frankly, were sub-par both times around.But back to DARK WATER. I was struck with the rapport JENNIFER had with the young actress who played her daughter. They were so natural together on screen... perhaps her having become a new mother in real life contributed to her being so effortlessly maternal on screen.All and all, a wondrous performance in an erratic but good (if depressing) movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adept Psychological Thriller--But Not for Kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with the user comment above in regard to the fact that teenagers will not appreciate this film. I kept telling myself as I was watching it, that it is not a movie that kids will understand. I shouldn't say 'all' kids, but probably most. Ironically, this is a movie that kids should see because they can learn about elements that a good movie usually contains: developed characters, a good plot, and excellent acting, to name a few. Not to mention that the movie gives the viewer a lot to think about and is an expertly crafted piece of psychological suspense.There are reasons this movie will most likely not appeal to young people. To begin with, it is NOT a horror movie. It might be marketed to look like one, but it is more of a psychological thriller of sorts. So many kids will go to it expecting blood, gore and action, but get a literate, story-driven film instead--one in which thinking is required to fully understand what is going on. This is a movie that requires "active" viewing, just as if one were to read a well written novel with round characters, symbolism, and whatever other elements it may have to raise it beyond the level of mediocrity.Unlike a more conventional horror movie like Boogeyman (which I also liked for other reasons), Dark Water is rooted in psychology and the inner and outer conflicts the characters attempt to overcome. It is also a film adept in creating a dark, disturbing mood. In fact, I was really impressed with its ability to play with one's emotions and fears so strongly. As another use noted above, it's almost as if the 'horror' is subliminal. The viewer doesn't necessarily have to see it in order to feel it. I think this is partly because we've all dealt with bits and pieces of what some of the main characters have to go through here. Some of their own discomfort seems familiar to us.It is sad that many younger people cannot appreciate movies of this nature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Right movie for the wrong audience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, Jennifer Connelly is just awesome, in this movie and everything she's ever done since she was barely a teenager (Labrynth). With that said though, I have a bone to pick with this movie.Dark Water has set itself up as a 'ghost' horror movie, and thus attracted an audience who expected to see blood, gore, chase scenes, a creepy ghost, and maybe even a naked Jennifer. Dark Water has none of these things, except the ghost, who is actually a small part of the movie.What this movie should have advertised was a mother struggling after a divorce...a woman unable to escape the demons of her childhood...a ~mystery~ only she can solve, brought to her attention by the ghost of a child whose life clearly mirrored her own past before it was tragically ended...and a daughter caught in the middle of it all. If this is what Dark Water portrayed itself as, it would have been better received, as it would have had the correct audience. It may have even impressed those who weren't originally interested (Fathers/Sons/Boyfriends getting dragged along) as they wouldn't have expected gooey, gory, bloody things only to be let down.Anyway, I tend to be a little more open-minded, so though Dark Water wasn't what I expected I still found it very enjoyable. The storyline was deep, and sad...maybe even worth a tear or two. Connelly's acting was top-notch, as always. And after watching the original, I have to say this is one of the better remakes out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At Last a Gripping Hollywood Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dark Water may not be the new Rosemary's Baby - it's not quite subtle enough for that - but it proves itself a solid suspense-film nonetheless. In a time when movie-makers seem more intent on shaking us up than actually involving us in a story, this film comes as something of a revelation - a horror movie where the tension builds gradually, where human interest takes precedence over cheap shock-effects. The recent horror-excursion Saw seems cheesy and amateurish by comparison to Dark Water with its brooding intensity, its emotional texture. A movie like Saw is all about playing to the tastes of morbid adolescents, the kind of people who still think Marilyn Manson is cool. A movie like Dark Water provides a somewhat more sophisticated, though still readily accessible, brand of chills.Like Rosemary's Baby the film is all about a threatening environment. Dahlia, who has recently separated from her husband, moves with her young daughter Ceci into a rent-controlled housing complex on Roosevelt Island, NY., a run-down tenement with a sleazy landlord, a grouchy super and a few dark secrets. Dahlia and Ceci are barely settled-in before they start experiencing signs of a haunted-movie-setting: strange noises from the room upstairs, bad dreams, a nasty water-stain spreading through the ceiling - all things that can be rationally accounted-for, of course, except that Dahlia suspects something more sinister than noisy neighbors or bad plumbing. The problem is that Dahlia herself is not exactly the picture of mental stability. She has lots of issues left over from her rotten childhood; she's unsettled after the separation from her husband; she suffers migraines - in short, the apparent supernatural manifestations could all be in her head. Like Rosemary's Baby the film teases us with the possibility that the heroine is simply delusional, that the strange goings-on are part of some paranoid fantasy. The difference is in the subtlety of the effect. In Rosemary, Roman Polanski achieved an unnerving atmosphere through purely cinematic means; in Dark Water, director Walter Salles employs more explicit imagery in helping generate a feeling of fear. Dark Water is less-accomplished than Rosemary cinematically, is more conventional in its effect, but it's still a worthy successor to Polanski's classic. It's genuinely involving, and like Rosemary it revolves around a brilliant, complex performance.That performance is turned-in by Jennifer Connelly, one of the most riveting actors on the planet. Like Naomi Watts in The Ring, Connelly provides acting chops and understated sex appeal, and an uncanny ability to pull one deeper into the story. The mystery-plot of The Ring depended entirely upon Watts's ability to sell it, and the suspense-plot of Dark Water depends equally upon Connelly's. This is a juicy part for any actress, a troubled woman attempting to protect her child from some unknown threat, and Connelly just kills it dead. Her dark hair and haunting eyes fit perfectly with the film's brooding aesthetic, but what she brings in pure emotional focus is even more valuable. What Connelly possesses is an almost freakish talent for conveying psychic turmoil, the sense of a character being eaten alive by inner-demons. She showed this ability first in Requiem for a Dream, then in House of Sand and Fog as a lonely, troubled outcast, and in Dark Water she outdoes herself. Her Dahlia is a horror-movie heroine for all-times, right up there with Farrow's Rosemary - a character so fully-realized, so memorable that it transcends its origins. The best parts of Dark Water are those when suspense-mechanics and horror-imagery become irrelevant, and what we're left with is the story of a woman's psychological disintegration. If the film overall fails to quite rise to its star's level, it's only because the plotting is a little too routine and the tone at times too insistent. It could've stood to be a little more subtle, and take better advantage of Connelly, but even as it is, Dark Water is a superior suspense exercise.</fullReview>

The apartment she moves alongside her daughter seems perfect at first . Dahlia carries her daughter to nearly school where the teacher (Camyn Manheim) teaches her and she , subsequently , hires a lawyer (Tim Roth) for the divorce . Soon , though , weird things start happening into house . Huge water stains appear on the ceiling and drip constantly , more water and oozing liquid into the rooms everyday .

A child's red bag shows up in odd places and soon the child herself starts appearing and causing usual poltergeists phenomenon recreated with high grade special effects . Dahlia then discovers the origin of the specter .This new version of Hideo Nakata film is plenty of screams , fear , suspense , thriller and results to be quite entertaining . The terror moments are delivered compactly and quietly with no fuss . The script copies exactly the Japan original movie without surprises . While the look is suitable atmospheric and eerie , the plot stretches plausibility to the breaking point . Nice acting by Jennifer Connelly , she turned down the role of Paige in ¨House of wax¨ (2005) , another horror remake , in order to appear in this one . Colorful cinematography by Alfonso Beato , usual cameraman of Salles , and creepy musical score fitting to horror movie by Angelo Badalamenti (Twin Peaks) .

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful Film, Superbly Acted by Connelly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dark Water" is a remake of a Japanese horror film. The movie is about Dahlia, a woman who is going through a bitter divorce dispute with her husband. She decides to relocate to Roosevelt island on the coast of New York, with her daughter, Ceci. After going house searching, they decide on an old apartment complex that is being restored. Ceci seems to like the place, especially when she finds a Hello Kitty backpack on the building's rooftop. But after the two move into the small sky-high apartment, strange things start to happen. The neighbor above is always running their water, and strange noises come from up there. At least Dahlia thinks it's a neighbor, until she discovers that nobody lives up there anymore, and the handyman figures it's some kids pulling pranks by plugging the sinks and running the water. But the water continues to leak, emitting large black water stains on the ceiling. No matter what they do, the dark water keeps coming back, and the ghost of the young girl who lived there begins to visit Dahlia and Ceci, and is jealous of Ceci because her mother abandoned her.I liked the story to this film, even though it's a remake. The film built up plenty of suspense throughout, and kept you not knowing what to expect next. Jennifer Connelly was completely perfect in her role, playing the woman who has all too many problems - a bitter divorce, bad memories from her own childhood and her mother, and on top of that the ghost of a little girl is terrorizing she and her daughter. Don't forget about the black water that keeps on leaking from the ceiling also. She's a great actress, and did perfect in the role. In fact, I felt all the characters had depth to them, and the conflicts in film were well established. There are some really creepy scenes in the film, including the basement laundry scene and all of the occasions when Dahlia goes to investigate what exactly is going on in the apartment above her. The ending to the film was actually a bit heartbreaking, but thoughtful at the same time, and I think that it fit the film well. Overall, "Dark Water" is a suspenseful, scary, all around good movie. It's not a slasher or gore film, it's more psychological and supernatural, and it keeps you entertained and interested the whole way through as you watch a woman experience complete paranoia. And, it's all topped off with an excellent lead performance and a unique story. I enjoyed it. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Five years after Memento and Requiem for a Dream, another great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*******WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!!!!! Do not read any further if you haven't seen the movie !!!!! (or you can read, but at your own risk) ******* Let's start with what Dark Water is not. Dark Water is not an horror movie as The Ring, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween. If you're looking for something like that, it's not your ideal movie. After all, there is only one chilling scene, and it's quite at the end.Instead, Dark Water is a slow, minimalist story. Walter Salles doesn't want to rush, and takes the audience through a calm journey: he uses still images of the buildings rather than fast scenes, and I have to thank him for that. As Haruki Murakami in his novels, Salles manages to tell a Japanese story that could happen in every part of the globe. New York, Tokyo, Rome, Moscow, it doesn't matter. But by telling his story, he remains faithful to the spirit of the Japanese storyline: a one-way trip towards a bitter ending, that has a strong meaning for the players of this drama -but also for the spectators.The cast of actors is simply superb. Tim Roth, Pete Postelthwaite, John C. Reilly and the young Ariel Grade are great in their supporting parts; but of course the real stunning performance in this movie is from Jennifer Connelly. Playing the role of Dahlia, Jennifer doesn't steal the scenes: she's no super heroine or superstar. She's just an average, single mom with a lot of problems. She has to relocate with her daughter to a less fancy part of the city, because the rents are less expensive; her husband is giving her hell over their divorce; she's looking for a job, not really knowing what to do, going through embarrassing selections just to find a place close the her apartment and with a good health insurance; and she has to deal with her own problems, migraines, the memories of a mother too absent during her childhood, and a bad water leak that is ruining her new flat, just as she moved in. Connelly manages to give a face to all these fears with her interpretation. At the end, these are the fears that everyone, man or woman, white or black, Japanese or American, could have to deal with in the course of his/her life.But, as in every life, there is an abrupt change that can always happen. And so it is here. Cecilia, Dahlia's daughter, starts to play, talk and respond to an "imaginary" friend, Natasha, that we will find out was the name of girl that disappeared from the apartment above Dahlia's one, and that will be found dead later in the water tank on the top of the building. Dahlia decides to face the problem on her own, talking to her daughter, trying to protect her from this danger. But also Dahlia has hallucinations: she sees her mother in her nightmares, haunting her.Here, the film becomes really beautiful, because Salles and Connelly doesn't give the audience any clue of what is really happening next.One interpretation is that the spirit of Natasha starts to play with Ceci and Dahlia, with the ultimate goal to control both and become Dahlia's daughter. While Ceci is taking a bath, Natasha appears, sitting next to Dahlia on the sofa. Worried, Dahlia rushes to the bathtub, just to find Natasha sinking Ceci's head in the (clear) water. Since the bathtub has a bulletproof glass, locked from the inside (again, from the evil Natasha!) the only way for Dahlia to save her daughter is to promise, whispering, to become Natasha's mother "forever". It's a desperate act of love, an incredible sacrifice that she has to make: the sacrifice of her own life to save her daughter's. Now, it's the dark water coming from somewhere that takes Dahlia's life, turning her into a ghost; a ghost that anyway will always look after Ceci, every time she's in need of her mother.However, we don't know many things about this ending. We don't know who killed Natasha. We don't' know why Natasha and young Dahlia are played by the same actress -is it only because of a low budget policy? We don't know when and how Dahlia dies -was it the water, or was it before? We don't know if she really sees her husband giving money and lighting a cigarette to some punks that scared Dahlia when she was in the basement -or was it just an(other) hallucination? We don't know what happened to Dahlia in her childhood, and what she had to go through to become the woman she is. We just know that Dahlia had to suffer to build her life. But she's taking some pills, and at the end she may have even dreamed of everything else.Another interpretation is that Dahlia turns mad at some point. But even in her madness, she has a deep, unstoppable love for her daughter. What is waiting Ceci in her future? If Dahlia is really turning mad, Ceci will have an history of suffering, looking after the ghost of her mother, locked in some remote clinic. Is that what Dahlia wants to be, a ghost in flesh and bones, an evil presence in the life of her beloved Ceci -just as Dahlia's mother? Is it Natasha or is it Dahlia who's haunting Ceci, not allowing her to live a normal life? Now, it's time to choose. And Dahlia chooses to give up her life, letting Ceci to live without troubles: the "good" ghost of her mother (i.e.: happy memories) will follow her, "forever".However, we will never know what really happened in that last, tragic night, and that's the beauty of this movie.In any case, Dark Water remains an astonishing story of a deep sacrifice, wonderfully developed by Salles and Connelly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Apartment to Die For</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Subtlety can go a long way when trying to remake a well-known horror movie. In this case, yet another of Hideo Nakata's incursion into the realm of terror gets an updated feel, and relying solely on the slow escalation of the drama that unfolds in the rent-controlled apartment Dahlia moves into with her young daughter and on Dahlia's own unreliable point of view as the main character, DARK WATER goes one step beyond being a shot-by-shot remake and claims the story as its own.A sequence takes place in 1974 in Seattle as young Dahlia waits for her mother to pick her up from school under the never-ending rain. A remark from a teacher sets the stage for the audience to believe that this is not a caring mother. Flash-forward to New York City in 2005, and Dahlia is now undergoing a nasty custody battle with her husband. He lives in Jersey City; she has found a place on Roosevelt Island where she can start life anew while providing for her daughter whom she dearly loves.This apartment building, however, is not the kind of place anyone would want to move in. But times are tough, and she has little to no choice. Ceci (child actress Ariel Gade) is the first to sense something amiss in this apartment -- particularly a smudge at the corner of the bedroom -- but Dahlia has made up her mind. They move in against their better judgement... and like in all of horror movies, things start to go wrong, at first slowly, in minuscule doses. You get the hint.One of the best things about the way DARK WATER has been made is to focus less on the horror per se and grant no "Boos!" to the audience, and establish two things: the unreliability of Dahlia's mind and her dependence on pills, compounded with her own personal demons, and her genuinely loving relationship she shares with Ceci, a girl who for once doesn't look creepy or draw ominously. For quite some time there is a notion that maybe Dahlia's husband may be behind the goings-on at 10F, the apartment above hers, but several blink or miss elements clearly establish the presence of the ghost in the machine.The mood is closer, as a matter of fact, to the horror of REPULSION and ROSEMARY'S BABY in which a woman undergoes a progressive fragmentation of her own psyche as other people seem to know more than what she does as to what is exactly happening. Jennifer Connelly, one of the best younger actresses working today, establishes a connection with Dahlia from the first moment she enters the screen, and her descent into near-madness (which she carries throughout the entire movie) is a work of art Hitchcock would have loved. She is well supported by John C. Reilly as a slumlord, Pete Postelwhaite as a building super who looks as untrustworthy as he sounds, and Dougray Scott as Dahlia's estranged husband. Tim Roth has a neat but disturbing role as a lawyer who apparently lives out of his own car.As a horror story, there is little of that here. It's a ghost story first and foremost, concerned with the tragedy that took place in the past which looks to reaffirm itself in the present. This is a quiet movie -- devoid of all flash and grandiosity -- and one that is very well drawn out. One of the best sequences occurs near the end, when the ghost within the building emerges in the most deceptive way, while we look and cringe in rising fear. This precedes a great suspense inducing shot of the now restored wall and ceiling as Dahlia tells Ceci a story, and tells her she'd do anything for her. Pity Dahlia didn't know these walls have eyes and ears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different, interesting and well done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read many reviews and seen the reasonably low score for this film and was surprised after I watched the film with an open mind. The film is a bit slow to start but gets more interesting as the custody battle between the parents becomes more strong and confusing, and the audience have to grasp with Dahlia's rightful concern of her daughter or her delusional paranoia brought on by a troubled past and stubborn migraines which I think were very well portrayed, the sound effects and emotions on Connely's face were very well portrayed, I could really feel the pain she is going through. I also felt strongly for her because I didn't know whether to trust Mr. Veck the reluctant janitor played excellently by Pete Poselthwaite and the seemingly ignorant manger played by John C Reilly. Also the threat of the "punks" who also live in the apartment and suddenly confront Dahlia in the laundry basement which issued me with a completely different reason to fear for her safety, and as the plot thickens and she discovers more about this place and the apartment above hers, I found the film irresistibly paced and beautiful to watch. The film isn't as hard or confusing as I expected it to be and the ending is excellent, but very sad, I can say Dark Water is to be added to my list of films that I felt like crying at. The music which intertwines with the web of suspense throughout the film is masterfully utilised and is much more effective than music which could have been sudden and obvious to expose certain "jump out of your seat" moments which isn't what Dark Water is about. The performances all around are excellent, especially the luminous Connely and her lonely lawyer Platzer played by the great as always Tim Roth. The only thing I could complain about and in my opinion make the film better *possible spoiler following* is when Dahlia is asleep next to her daughter and she has the nightmare about going up to the apartment 10F upstairs and sees her mother/herself/Natascha's mother in the bathroom, although well done I think was slightly confusing, and on my region 2 DVD on the bonus features there is an alternate sequence for this called "Wall of Water" which was very impressive, showing Natascha summoning water to cascade down her wall like a waterfall into Dahlia's apartment, and to Dahlia's despair downstairs, her acting is serene in this scene and the use of CGI is superb, I only wish this scene was included in the final cut. A superb and surprising horror. Watch it with an open mind. 10/10. I have read the novel which is a collection of short stories and "Floating Water" from which this film is based is only about 50 pages long. I think it was excellently adapted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The Ring' can't stand up! Hollywood does a GOOD remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood is making itself famous for remaking or adapting classical Japanese, Korean and even British horror films recently since the great success of 'The Ring' (Adapted from the original horror masterpiece, 'Ring' or 'Ringu'). After seeing the original masterpiece 'Ring', I was disappointed at how lacking the remake was. With it's pointless shocks, boring "extra" story lines and dull dreary look, made we wonder why I was so excited to see the remake of 'Dark Water'.This time I had seen the original 'Dark Water' (Honogurai mizu no soko kara), and though it wasn't a world beater nor very scary, it did tug my heart strings and I was curious to see just how much of a mess Hollywood had made of this remake. I was, however, pleasantly surprised at this film. 'Dark Water' is a wonderful adaption of the film and is actually right up there with the original Japanese version. The feel wasn't too cheesy and the storyline remains faithful to the original. Acting from everyone was top notch and, unlike in 'The Ring', you prayed for the safety of the little child.Jennifer Connelly played Dahlia, the single mother. She played it perfectly and I feel that she kept my attention till the very end with her grace and excellent acting skills. 'Dark Water' is an extremely hard film (like 'Ring') to act in with the psychological confusion that has to be made clear in her character. Connelly played her role to perfection and did a better job then any woman has in any Hollywood horror movie in a long time. Her acting was equal to that of Hitomi Kuroki in the original and I found no faults whatsoever in her role as Dahlia. She was the original choice to play Rachel Keller in 'The Ring', so it's nice to see her in another Hideo Nakata horror remake (and a better one of that).I was also very impressed by Ariel Gade who played Dahlia's daughter, Ceci. Her acting was so impressive and she carried us towards the end with the film with her heartbreaking tears and amazing sweetness that just tore through you. She was the classical Hollywood child who has the sixth sense and draws evil pictures, and she doesn't have all the answers. She was just a sign of pure innocence of a child and I think that she has quite a career going for her. If she keeps going the way she is, she could become equal to Jennifer Connelly and other big stars one day. A rare talent in someone so young is rare to find and I think she was perfectly cast as Ceci.Walter Salles, unlike Gore Verbinski, knew what was expected of 'Dark Water' to make it an equal to it's original. The direction was wonderful and I felt that thanks to this and the brilliant examples of acting that made the movie such a treat to sit there and watch. It didn't drag and it didn't for once make me think, "This is boring!" The storyline had only been edited for the good of a Western audience and it didn't patronize us with answers and explanations.With never a dull moment, Jennifer Connelly and Ariel Gade lead a tale of a mother and a daughter, wounded by recent divorce, trying to find a home they can afford. Their searching brings them to a run-down and damp old block of flats. After little Ceci telling her mother that she wants to live there, they move in. However, there are strange things happening around them: mysterious noises, running taps, imaginary friends and the strange disappearance of a young girl who had lived above them.'Dark Water' blows 'The Ring' out of the water when it comes to Hollywood remakes. From fear of ruining such a great film, I'll say no more other then to advise you to watch both the original and this remake. This is the best Hollywood Asian Horror Adaption you'll ever see.9/10 and 4.5 stars! It's wonderful!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect example of a film that deserves much more than IMDb 5,5 rating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I leave the analysis of this film to my predecessors, all has already been said here, and very well indeed. Jennifer Connelly is one very under-rated actress and this is one of her finest roles. Her intensity and charisma is beyond words and she deserves a lot (more) credit for "Dark Water" alone. I really wonder why this has been advertised as a horror film, to me it's psycho-drama at its best... OK, have to give it, there are a few "horroresque" little gimmicks, but I would still continue pointing out it's all about the atmosphere (eerie, sinister, wet and dark), not shock or gore. The music, the camera-work, the constant rain... in fact, this movie has so much WATER in it, it almost makes you feel you need a towel. And I mean it as a compliment. Needless to say Tim Roth is great at whatever he does, too bad his role here is a tad vague and small.There should be a rating system for people rating the films here. Anyone hitting "1" on Dark Water receive a paddling and a 0 (zero) from me. People with no taste or sense of class, altogether.Yours, kindly RTS Church of Jennifer Connelly - Division Munich</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I may be in the minority here, but I will say that I truly, very much enjoyed Dark Water. It was my very first horror movie (don't like scary stuff) and I invited over some friends to watch it. I was not disappointed in the least. It is suspenseful. If it's not very scary, I didn't mind.I loved Jennifer Connelly in the leading role, she is fantastic as single mom Dahlia Williams, who moves into a crappy (and creepy) apartment with her daughter (Ariel Gade). John C. Reilly is great as the Realtor who would do anything to get his property sold, and there's Pete Postlethwaite's performance as the maintenance guy who you know is hiding something from the beginning.The ending is touching and sad, and Connelly's performance enhances it even more.Dark Water is an excellent, very underrated film. I think if people look deeper, they will find more than they expected.3.5/4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well, of course i expected this to be a horror movie, with lots of scares and jumping moments and it did have its thrilling moments. What made it better is that its not all about the horror of the situation, but about who we are, what we feel, what we are ready to do for the ones we love. Its strange how people change and how you can find warm in people you don't know, how people who love you can turn cold, how the lost love can come back unexpectedly. congratulations to the team who created this remake. i haven't seen the original, but wouldn't be surprised if it carries the same messageoverall - a good movie, even as a remake, it is well produced, with a lot of effort and i'm glad i watched itpeace</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Genre Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very first shot you know this movie will be good stuff, and it doesn't disappoint. Through either old film stock, or, more likely, after effects, 1970s Seattle drips with authentic creepiness. This movie takes part in present day (2005) New York, but keeps the dreariness. As all the other reviewers keep pointing out, this film sticks to the basic Japanese-American horror genre that has popped up since The Ring became such a success.1. Lots and lots of rain. 2. Lots and lots of gross tap water. 3. Lots of leaking water and flooding bathrooms. 4. Colors are nicely matched, i.e., blue/gray for outside, dark, low contrast for suspense scenes. 5. Scored well, builds suspense without attracting or distracting. 6. Strong maternal figure finds herself vulnerable, often isolated. 7. Child-ghost. 8. Disgusting hair. 9. Mystery of suicide and/or murder.If you're into these films, you won't be disappointed, it's solid work. You'll note most professional reviewers gave this fairly high marks probably because it delivers what one would expect from this genre. See it.Note, here are similar movies of the genre and my impressions, just to give you an idea of where I'm coming from.1. The Ring: best and most significant horror entry since the other genre redefining Scream 1 (not the same genre btw, also Scream 2, and 3 both were terrible). 2. The Grudge: Not as good as the Ring but very enjoyable and skillfully presented. 3. Ring Two: unsuccessful although it did keep the water, color and other genre elements...somehow never came together.Hope this helps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An effectively, psychologist supernatural thriller. Based on the strong 2002 Japanese film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dahlia (Oscar-Winner:Jennifer Connelly) is a mother of a little girl Ceci (Ariel Gade). Which Dahlia, who's recently divorced and she's going through an nasty custody battle with her ex-husband (Dougray Scott). Dahlia is searching for an apartment, she's finds one for an reasonable price in the island near Manhatten. Once she moved to her new apartment with her daughter, she finds out that it has an leakage of dark water in their bedroom. Ceci is been acting strangely and her made an imaginary friend named Natasha. Ceci is been obsessed with the School Bag, she's has found. Dahlia tries to convinced her landlord (John C. Reilly) and the building's administrator (Pete Postlehwaite) to repairs the damages in her bedroom. She's finds out... there's running water above her apartment, that causes the damaged but the trouble doesn't stop there. Dahlia is been having nightmares of her troubled childhood and the noises, she's still her hears above her apartment. Dahlia slowly finds out, there's was trouble in that apartment above her. She decides to investigated the apartment with any proof, she could find with the help of an dedicated lawyer (Tim Roth). Since her daughter found the school bag, which belong to the little girl. Who used to live above her and once she's finds out the truth. There's an unexpected tragedy awaits her.Directed by Walter Salles (The Motorcycle Diaries) made an intriguing, supernatural drama. Which is based on the terrific 2002 Japanese movie, of the same name. Director:Salles and Screenwriter:Rafael Yglesias (Fearless, Les Misérables "1998", From Hell) remained faithful to the original film by adding more character development by the supporting cast and changing certain plot points or suspense from the 2002 movie. Although the original was much more scarier and creepy. This new version is much more grim and unpleasant. But Connelly's excellent performance and an top supporting cast makes this remake work.DVD is the original theatrical cut to the movie. DVD has an sharp Pan &amp; Scan (1.33:1) transfer and an strong:Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has plenty of featurettes and two deleted scenes. The original "Dark Water" is based on a novel by Koji Suzuki (The Ring a.k.a "Ringu"). It was directed by Hideo Nakata (Ringu 1 &amp; 2, The Ring Two, L). Try to watch the Original Picture first before watching this American Remake. This remake does have an sense of humour. The comic relief of this film is Reilly as the sleazy landlord. Don't miss this intelligent, well-directed film. The Unrated Version is also available. Panavision. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a film about tragedy not a horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**contains possible spoilers and a comparison to the original** I rented the original Dark Water because it looked interesting, and because it was by (sp?) Hideo Nakata, who did the original Ringu. I haven't seen Ringu yet because the American remake of the Ring scared the crap out of me. I couldn't walk into a dark room alone for a week after that movie! Dark Water (Japanese) was a very different kind of movie, and I remember being struck by the underlying sadness of it, because a child that young is too cute to really be menacing, even in her Swamp Thing incarnation at the end. As a horror movie, I think the Japanese version lost something in the translation, too, since the version I was watching was dubbed, and the dubbing was absolutely awful.The tragedy of the original was how sad it was that a child that young can drown so close to her own home and no one's around to care, and the makers of the American version realized this. As a result, Dark Water isn't a horror movie by anyone's standards. Although it contains classic suspense elements along the lines of Rosemary's Baby and the Shining, like the other two, it's a film, not a scary movie.First off, it's beautifully acted. Jennifer Connelly, in addition to being one of the most stunningly gorgeous women on the planet, is a mesmerizing actress and brings depth and subtlety to even her most hysterical moments. The superb cast, which includes a wonderfully creepy Pete Postlethwaite as a suspect Eastern European caretaker, Tim Roth as a shady lawyer, and John C. Reilly as an indifferent property manager, takes potentially stock characters and fleshes them out. You expect them to be predictable, but they amaze you with how human and sad they all are. For example, the scene where Tim Roth is telling Connelly over the phone that he can't talk because he's just about to take his family to a movie, then he walks in alone, is heartbreaking.I was looking forward to this remake because what struck me about both the story of the Ring and the Japanese version of Dark Water was the underlying theme of the destruction of the family unit. What the Japanese movies seem to be saying, since there's a single mother protecting her child at the centre of both stories, is that if a woman has to raise a child on her own, the child will be abandoned and bad things can come in. Both films feature obvious womb/mother imagery (the well and the water tower specifically) with water (emotion, mothering, the Primal Source, etc.) at the centre. But in both cases, water isn't a life source, it's a destroyer, and the wombs aren't life-giving, they're barren, empty, death-giving wombs. (Just a side note, it's not like the women would have been better off with a man in these movies, because the male characters were all such morons!) The American version of Dark Water didn't leave me with the same sense that the author's agenda was about restoring the family unit, but with a feeling of sadness for all the characters. They're abandoned as children so they become isolated adults, and it made me both curious about the supporting characters' stories and concerned for the future of the child. It was both hopeful and tragic, and it's rare that movies inspire compassion for a constructed world where what you see on screen isn't something that could ever be realistic or relate-able. This movie makes you believe in it, and that makes it not just a step, but a huge flying leap above other "horror" movies.</fullReview>

But please don't treat this as a scary movie if you have seen the Japan Dark Water.

The ending was a bit of a shock and a surprise I didn't expect it which was really good, because it was a sad ending I think made it harder for people to like it. You don't find many films that don't end happily ever after these days, thats why I really liked this one. The film made me cry at the end something I never really do at films (especially in the cinema!) But I thought that made it even more of a moving film. Also, as the last comment added definitely should not have been called horror as such. Jennifer Connelly did a great job on this film as well as the young girl.

		<shortDescription>A great movie that's been badly marketed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As many other reviewers have mentioned before this movie was wrongly marketed as a horror movie. I found it to be more of a psychological horror rather than a pop-up scary faces type deal. The movie was extremely effective in creating an unsettling, suspenseful atmosphere and I found myself roped into Jennifer Connelly's characters' fear and uncertainty as it becomes hard to distinguish what's real and what's not. A lot of time was taken to establish character and atmosphere which was done effectively although I felt sometimes it lost it's way and some scenes could have been left out. All in all it was a well done movie with great characters that brought you in, an excellently created atmosphere that kept things suspenseful and had me feeling unsettled and a beautiful, bittersweet ending. (P.S. hope everyone's done with their generalizations of teenagers because you're sounding like a bunch of bitter old farts who's never actually met one.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription># 58 : Dark Memories (dvd)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give "10" to this movie because it deserves it: it's a chilling movie that is successful upon me. In other words, it made me very uneasy. The trick is that the movie by itself has nothing to do about it. But in a mysterious way, it manages the incredible feat of catching all my most personal pains and fears: Water, first: if I got something wrong in my studio, it's a vicious leak that keeps going in my toilets for eight years. I keep telling my landlord who does nothing thus I keep cleaning it! Next, Jenny's studio: it looks like the one of an old couple I know: same ugly sad bare painted walls all over the place. Next, the building: I lived in a similar one for one year, with the same empty lobby, lousy elevator, basement with washing machine and dark stories. Next, Jenny and her daughter: she plays here a divorced mother with a little child and I knew this situation myself: my dearest and more dreadful friend was like this: it really breaks my heart to see Jenny cooks for the family, takes her daughter to school, gives her to the father as I witnessed that already. Finally, Jenny: she is almost the twin sister of a girl I know whose name is, funny or not, also Jenny C. I think that Jenny shows a great talent here. She is a courageous mother but in the same time, you can feel she is very fragile.Haunted by all these heavy and dark memories for me, this movie was painful to watch all the more that the final minutes just kill all hope! I think a mention should be made to the production because it's visually really dark as well: all clothes, paints, light ranged from green to brown. The only bad point would be the Badalamenti's score which is scarce and drowned under the water noises.As i intend to visit NYC soon, I will make the trip to this terrible Roosevelt Island to put some sunny lights and exorcise all those personal and cinematographic ghosts as well!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dark Water is another one of those slow PG-13, atmospheric and creepy ghost stories in the vein of The Ring and the Grudge, and like those two, it is worthwhile.The film certainly has flaws, but it is also clever and has some great drama. Jennifer Connely also gives a strong performance, and the film as a whole is probably slower than someone would think. While it is not as scary as The Ring or The Grudge, it is in a way more mature than those two because it does excel in genres other than as a thriller. Overall, it was not amazing, but certainly underrated at this time and certainly worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dark Water was so much better than the Ring as it "made sense". Yes Ino it's a ghost story. But it was spooky, very suspenseful and without gore. and The camera work and direction was excellent, as you felt like you were peaking around corners and into rooms you weren't suppose too. You knew something was coming, but were still jolted to see it. The writing is good as no words were wasted and all characters were complex and interesting.SPOILERIn the "Ring" there was no logical reason why the little girl sought revenge on so many strangers, yet the little girl's ghost had a reason, not to spend the after-life alone. She either wanted a friend, or a mother.I believe the hype that Dark Water was just like the Ring, cooled the box office. Also, maybe another title would of done better with a stronger message, something more urgent like to stress it's genre: "Where's My Mommy?" "Life for Rent"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Add me to the non teenage minority who sees a beautifully filmed and acted drama in Dark Water. The horrors take a back seat to the gripping familial drama of both Dahlia's and Natasha's, which are subtly sketched out in the moody shadows of the apartment and in Dahlia's dreams. Connelly really shines here, carrying the entire film on her shoulders, evoking great sympathy for her character. It is to the film's credit that the mother and daughter bond is so convincingly portrayed, the ending becomes truly sad but emotionally poignant. I cried at the unfolding of the final scene. I prefer this remake to the original, the acting is much better, and the story, though not as scary, is much more believable.It is a wonderful. beautiful, albeit dark and wistful drama, and great for all mothers and daughters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I almost cried!!!! What have they done to Hideo Nakata's masterpiece?!?!?! I have to confess to being against the idea of a remake of this one since I have seen the original Ring and remake The Ring and was unimpressed with the remake. The whole film was a lot more blatant than it should have been in my opinion, everything was spelled out, there was hardly any tension or chill built up in direct contrast with the original.I had issues with the use of the bag and coat. The bag and coat were things that I had serious issues with also. In Hideo Nakata's stunning masterpiece, a lot is made of the little red bag and it's reappearance and the fact that the little girl has a distinctive yellow mack is well used in the style of Don't Look Now. One scene in particular where Yoshimi is going up to the roof and the door is open just a crack and you see the Mitsuko in her yellow mack walk past the door. It's really good. In the remake, both Natasha and Ceci are seen wearing a red coat and no big deal is made of it.My big problem, as you may have predicted, is the ending (isn't it always). In the Japanese version, Yoshimi goes up to the roof and climbs the water tower, she figures out what has happened and then, after the spookiness of something/someone punching through the tank, goes into the flat to find Ikuko passed out on the floor of the bathroom floor. She picks her up and carries her to the lift, which get stuck, then there is the tension building moment as Yoshimi watches the door of her flat open, expecting to see Mitsuko appear, but it's Ikuko. Then Mitsuko, a decomposed child, hugs and almost throttles Yoshimi. Yoshimi realises that there is no point struggling and that the only way to save Ikuko is to look after Mitsuko. She hugs her and tells her she is her mother and she shouts at Ikuko to stay back. Then the lift doors close and Ikuko is crying, looking through the window, Yoshimi looks back for a moment then looks at Mitsuko. The lift goes up and the haunting music escalates. Ikuko runs up the stairs and looks in the lift shaft. She can't see anything so she sits on the floor. Next thing the lift doors open and Ikuko is covered in water. It is a truly beautiful and moving scene. You sit there looking at poor little Ikuko lying in the pool of water, soaked through, sobbing for her mother and your heart just tears.Remake, Dahlia puts Ceci in the bath and then is on the phone. She sees a little girl in a hooded dressing gown walk past here and assumes it's Ceci. She starts to read her a story and then hears Ceci in the bath. She basically rejects Natasha and then Natasha goes into the bathroom and starts to drown Ceci. When Dahlia breaks into the bathroom she starts to bargain with Natasha "what do you want?" etc. Then she tells Natasha to take her and leave Ceci alone. Then you see Dahlia's body being carried out, blatantly dead, as opposed to the original where Yoshimi just vanishes.The very final scene in the original is 10 years later when Ikuko is in the area where she used to live as she is going to visit a friend. She says she can't remember being at kindergarten, and she finds herself walking back to her old apartment. There she sees her mother and they chat, she complains that no-one told her that her mother was living here and asks Yoshimi if she can come and live with her. Yoshimi says that she is sorry that Ikuko can't come and live with her. You then see Mitsuko in the background, behind Ikuko and when Ikuko turns around, Mitsuko and Yoshimi both disappear. Ikuko then says "my mother was here all this time, protecting me." It's a beautiful ending. In the remake, Ceci returns 3 weeks later and her mother appears to her in the lift. It just doesn't work.There you go, end of tirade. See them for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of scary movies, and this one didn't disappoint! After seeing a lot of the garbage that has come out in the scary movie genre recently, I was very surprised to find that "Dark Water", which did not get many stellar reviews, was truly a movie worth the four dollars I paid to rent it.This film follows in the footsteps of other Japanese remake horror films that the US has been putting out recently. I'm not usually a fan of those movies because they usually fall flat in the pay-off department. These films are about the weird and supernatural, but they spend too much time teasing you and not enough time coming up with a solid, satisfying finale. "Dark Water" has an intriguing storyline that kept me interested all the way through, and ends with a tragic but ultimately satisfying ending that I did not expect. I wouldn't call the ending a total surprise, but the point is that it was completely obvious from the beginning, and it made sense given the characters and the plot.Also-- great acting! Jennifer Connolly really made the movie, and John C. Reilly as the apartment complex owner was a nice surprise! The little girls in the movie were also super cute, and not all creepy and bug-eyed like most scary movie kids.Rent this movie if you're in the mood for some great acting and a little bit of spookiness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a very similar opinion to a previously posted comment. This movie, while having some horror elements in it, isn't exactly a horror movie. It's a drama and as a drama, it's excellent. I'm 19 years old. I watched the movie expecting to see a standard horror movie and saw something much different instead. But being the open-minded, eclectic-movie-liker that I am, I enjoyed it all the same. In fact, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Is this movie scary? I'd say a little bit, in a few spots but overall no. But it certainly kept me on the edge of my seat! Most people will have no idea where this movie is going...no idea how things will end and that's exciting. Jennifer Connally (can't spell) is a wonderful actress playing a woman who's a great mom...we want her so bad to "win". I was able to root for her. The little girl (insert-actress-name-here) was great...I honestly wasn't sure if she was disturbed or not, but her genuine sweetness made me care about her all the same.Perhaps this movie would be better classified as a thriller...a slightly slow thriller. Bottom line is, this is a great, drama/horror/thriller involving characters that we can care about and feel for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not often nowadays to experience a truly eerie, creepy movies without the monsters and the sudden shockingly horror-filled scenes of blood and gore. Little known director Walter Salles has created the best pure psychological-supernatural thriller of 2005 and takes its beauty and suggestive ominous chilling thrills from Hitchcock's The Birds (1963) and Rosemary's Baby (1968). The color design, the direction, the photographic direction, the entire approach to creating and sustaining a psychological air of tension and dread without resorting to extraordinary special effects or typical horror-filled moments are superb. The music and sound effects layered the density of the subtle performance to produced one of the best psychological-thrillers since The Sixth Sense (1999) and in some ways surpass it. Except the the ending scenes that while are apparent in its more substantive and qualitatively superior climax still fails to have the same intense impact of The Sixth Sense and in some ways failed to totally capture the possibilities of emotional conflict and resolution that the director intended. Eight out Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dark Water was highly anticipated by me. As of late I have become a fan of the American translated Japanese Horror films beginning with the terrifying and incredible Ring and Ring II and The Grudge. I won't say that Dark Water disappointed me in any way I will only say it took me by complete surprise. Dark Water is certainly not what it represents itself to be. Dark Water is the story, almost a drama, about a woman with a horrific childhood now trying to deal with her own separation and raising her beloved child Ceci. Out of desperation for a new life she settles into a apartment complex just outside of Manhattan and as it turns out the building has some secrets inside of it that just kind of exist throughout her own story and problems. If you removed the "minor" Ghost story from Dark Water you would have a very real and emotional drama all by itself but instead there is the ghost story.Jennifer Connelly plays the rather emotionally disturbed, but desperately trying her best, Dahlia. She loves her daughter deeply and she is a great mother despite her own harsh past with her mother which is continually haunting her. Connelly does a good job, she performs intense emotion very well. I always though of her as somewhat of an over actor and I still feel that but she still is something of a presence on screen and this film seems to suit her. She has a disturbed look about her and the role is perfect for her. Her young daughter is played by newcomer Ariel Gade, who I was already familiar with from her recent stint on TV's invasion. She's adorable and not annoying at all for a child actress. She plays her role perfectly and has some very frightening and moving moments. Supporting actors include Pete Postlethwaite as the very odd Mr. Veeck, Camryn Manheim as Ceci's teacher, and John C. Reilly as the landlord of the building. They all do their share to add to the film but really everything rests on the characters played by Connelly and Gade. They support the film with ease and they are captivating enough to watch which is great.The story is a little slow, it doesn't move at the pace of say The Ring or The Grudge but unfolds a little more cautiously and moves slower which in some ways reduces the real horror or intensity of the scary scenes. The water which plagues Dahlia in her apartment is a nice tough to the horror genre. There is something very frightening about it which is the whole point and there is definitely some rather disturbing scenes but nothing that will really make you jump or your skin crawl. I think for most people you'll just enjoy watching the characters and their story unfold. It's definitely easy watching and worth seeing but so hard to explain. It's not horror, not drama, it's just dark, creepy at times and captivating. To compare this film to The Ring, or Amityville Horror, or Exorcism of Emily Rose is just completely ludicrous because they share nothing in common. The latter of those films are outright horror films and Dark Water is kind of a genre all on it's own. Certainly it's dark, protruding setting is disturbing but it's not a horror movie per se. Parts of it I think are also a little retread in past films and I must admit I thought the ending just sucked but you know it is so hard to end a film like this. The ending was obviously thought about a lot and carefully put into place and I mean it certainly makes sense but it just sucks...I felt completely let down by the ending and wanted something else completely. It would never make my top 10 or 20 or even 30 list but it's worth seeing just to form your own opinion of what you think of this unique thriller if you can call it that. It's....interesting!! 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>in the line up of remakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dahlia and Kyle are separating; and its an ugly one. Dahlia keeps accusing Kyle of an affair, though he pleas innocence. Dahlia has priority custody of their daughter Ceci. Dahlia and Ceci move to a new area of the city, into a an apartment block; but its very decrepit and it a cut and copy building, all the rooms look the same. Not helping with the new arising situation is the weather, its constantly raining and there are leaks sprouting everywhere in the building. A water mark has appeared in the ceiling of Dahlia's and Ceci's room, and it slowly becomes bigger. The room upstairs is currently vacant, but there is water running and someone is walking around the room. When starting at her new school, Ceci creates an imaginary friend, but is it a friend or something more.Dark water is a remake of the Japanese version Honogurai mizu no soko kara, in the every growing remake of Japanese horror remakes. The mood is dark and foreboding, yet there is a major flaw; its not scary. Though the original version wasn't scary either. When you look at both, they are more an observational look at parenting and the bond between mothers and daughters. So its more of a drama; with a supernatural twist. This has a very old horror movie build to it, it starts slow and as it goes along it builds in tension to it big conclusion. So it great to see this style come out again.What really hold this movie together is the cast. Jennifer Connelly, John C. Reilly, Pete Postlethwaite and the ever great Tim Roth. They really hold the story, they make this story seem believable. Another great factor was the very ambient score, it really enhanced many of the scenes.Though its not a good as the original version, its still strong enough to stand on its own merits as a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My perception of this film appears to be different from everyone else's, bizarrely. I very much enjoyed Dark Water - and on two levels: the dynamics between the characters, and the thrilling aspect.It's not particularly scary (and, I must admit, I prefer scary films that are actually scary), but it seems to me that it was marketed as a horror (at least in the UK), whereas it is clearly a slow-burning thriller. I think it works.The acting is superb - and the child is anything but annoying. Phew! I like Dark Water for what it is. I have a feeling that not many agree with me though...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good film but not horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>when I saw the ads for this film my thoughts were along the lines of "jesus Christ, stop with the Japanese horror remakes". As someone who watched ring before any of this palava kicked up whereby now creepy white kids are a staple part of any horror film I am sick to the teeth of them.Prior to seeing this I had just seen the descent, a superb British horror film, and somewhat had my faith restored in the genre. The really clincher was the fact that Waler Salles directed this and I really enjoyed the motorcycle diaries. I believe that you can see his touch throughout the film and are probably more likely to enjoy this if you've seen his previous work because you know what your getting.This is a classy drama film with tints of horror laden through it. Every time Connelly looks into the mirror (and believe me she does it a lot) your waiting for the creature to appear behind her. You are constantly waiting for that jump. The air of tension is maintained well and I the ghost itself is of a relationship between a mother and a daughter and that is essentially what this film is about. I was disappointed to see so many negative comments about this film because I actually believe its the fault of the marketing campaign that people will be let down. As a 20 something male I know nothing about the relationship between mother and daughter yet I really felt for the characters (the cast give beautiful performances a beauty mirrored in its direction) and it was handled delicately and thoughtfully. Not only this but it never gave in to the audience expectation of seeing that ghostly little kid or at least not in the way you expect it.A beautiful drama about motherhood, if thats what you want to see, see this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really not a bad film. Tense and disturbing ... not at all what the previews suggest. However, I found the casting of the three young girls very odd. Not in their acting abilities but simply in how they appeared. They all looked so much alike that it was extremely difficult to tell who was who. Perhaps the director was trying so say something with this but (for what it's worth) I feel he added unnecessary confusion.But, all in all, a well crafted film .... one that separates itself from the flood (no pun intended) of "scary little girl" horror movies.NOTE: Again, the previews released by the studio are misrepresenting the film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very scary but atmospheric and better than the ratings imply</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found Dark Water flowed very well, slowly grabbing me into its dark embrace. This is more of a psychological dramatic suspense with supernatural elements a la Hitchcock or Polanski (Rosemary's Baby) than a standard American horror thriller. It should be since this is a remake from a Japanese film based on a story from the guy who wrote the excellent "The Ring". I found the location, a cold brown industrial-looking apartment complex, rather creepy and effective, even more so since we see so many of those ugly and depressing buildings in cities. The dank atmosphere is also helped by the constant grey skies and falling rain. You barely ever see the sun.The fear factor works better here when it involves things that could happen in real life such as the widening stain on the ceiling or some weird plumbing woes. The surprise sudden apparition scares weren't as effective because they were usually telegraphed a second or two in advance. The "dark water" wasn't that scary by itself but it helped build the dark atmosphere and the great sound effects helped a lot. The cast was really amazing for a film of this type and I liked most of the characters (especially John C. Reilly as the friendly real estate guy and Tim Roth as the lawyer). The always wonderful Jennifer Connelly was so sensible and expressive as a loving single mother trying to cope in a new place. She pushed the film a notch above by her performance. An interesting story element was how we're kept wondering if the weird stuff happening is because of her fragile mental state or because of something else. The young 6 year old daughter was quite good and natural although her "friend" should have been better. If you're in the mood for a well-filmed and intimate, old-school yet modern atmospheric suspense with no gore (rarity these days), Dark Water is a good rental choice. It's particularly recommended to mothers for whom it would probably be even more effective.Rating: 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DARK WATER is not exactly what you'd expect from the director of "The Motorcycle Diaries", but it certainly features the same distinctive handwriting, and a quiet, almost tender voice of storytelling whispering a strange urban tale of an old dark house that's not dripping blood but water. Though of deliberate tempo and surely not a teen horror crowd pleaser, Salles's film delivers enough eerie moments to develop a gentle, but inescapably tightening grip, with an unobtrusive, but shining performance by Jennifer Connelly, plus perfectly casted supporting actors. Slowly moving, but never missing a beat, DARK WATER at heart isn't a ghost story, but a subtle meditation about parenthood, breakup, isolation, death, loss and grief. In short: Mature Cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original was not a great film. It was very slow and derivative of other Japanese scary films released around the same time. You know - the clichéd stuff with the ghostly apparitions with long hair etc. This film is one of those rare things - a western remake that is actually better than the original foreign language one. Ignore the other comments made here and see for yourself. You may be surprised as I was. The roles are all well cast and the acting is of a high quality. John c reilly's landlord character is amusing and lightens up the film somewhat. The little girl is sooo cute! You really feel for Jennifer Conolly's character as she struggles raising a young daughter with an imaginary friend (or is it?) in the most depressing tower block in the world, all on her own. The film has the same poignancy and sadness that permeates the more well received 'The others'. To the films detriment and I think this is reflected in the reviews, it also shares the mentioned films depressing tone. This is not a film for the manically depressed! All in all though this is a most impressive remake of a mediocre film. Seek it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pitch-perfect remake that spooked me out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A horror movie has to be moody. Atmospheric. The scares should creep up on me, unlike the sledgehammer approach that most slasher flicks (over)use. Make me invested in the fates of their characters, not make me feel glad that they're lambs for the slaughter.That's why I love 'El Orfanato', 'The Conjuring', 'The skeleton key', 'Paranormal activity' and quite a few others I'll talk about later on ('You're next' as well).But this here has probably one of the best Jennifer Connelly performances, and also one of the best soundtracks to boot. The setting's pitch-perfect, the slow-burn approach just tightened the noose round my neck and drew me ever closer, and I did not want anything to happen to the lead characters that I started to feel very, very close to, over the course of its oh-so-short running time. And a whopper of an ending ensured I'd be writing this, recommending this to you all, and defending it from those who didn't like it (didn't know better / were being pretentious little sods - take votre pick). Anyways, its called 'Dark Water', and is a remake (go figure it out) of a (what else?) Japanese flick, which, according to many, was the inferior version of this one: pitch- perfect casting/direction? Take your pick.This was also one where I was hiding behind my girl (wish I was kidding) while we watched during a few (ahem) key sequences. All in all, an excellent movie, with real great plot and acting, and as one user has mentioned here, great atmosphere. I would like to add that the soundtrack is extremely haunting as well, and stayed with me even after I left the movie theater. Certain moments in the movie caused me to feel scared, but the overall tone is more saddening than horrifying, its a movie about loneliness, and redemption. Definitely not for the shlock thrill-seeking kind, feel it was ultimately let down by misguided marketing and wrong expectations from the public who came to watch it, and who would have given bad word-of- mouth which might have worked against its box office prospects. Sad to note that a good work like this remained largely unseen/unappreciated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...they only made the movie that much better when I finally saw it. The acting was great--when was the last time I said that at ANY movie, let alone a horror remake?--and the premise was fascinating. I read a review stating that this movie wasn't a horror, but a psychological thriller. It helps to go into the movie thinking along those lines so that any scary scenes are made more unexpected. I loved this movie mainly because I had low expectations on all levels and it genuinely surprised me. The scares are Hitchcockesque and the plot is absolutely believable (given that you believe in ghost stories...but I meant the subplot involving her custody battles.) The greatest attribute was truly young Ceci's performance. I generally don't like child actresses (including Natalie Portman, though I loved Leon), but this little girl amazed me at...how much of a little girl she was. She wasn't playing up to act older, she was just a great actress. To wrap it up, if you haven't seen it, it totally sucks. Now go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since The Lord of the Rings, there have been few hours of cinematic genius at our disposal. No recent movie even comes close to Dark Water in an attempt to captivate and entertain its audience.At 20 years of age, My favourite movie list comprises of The Matrix, Equilibrium and Underworld, so how does such a movie as Dark Water reach the list? No attractive special effects, little action... but a phenomenal casting of actors and actresses. I was watching this movie, but at the same time, looking in on a real family. Real emotions, real pain, Real drama. On a couple of occasions, the movie grips you, from your very core, and refuses to let go. The finale takes you to a place that most movies cannot... I'm sure that you'll agree.Speaking honestly, I've only seen Jennifer Connelly perform in the movie 'Hulk' (Yes, I am embarrassed, so very ashamed), which provided her with little flexibility to portray her character. In Dark Water, she proves that she is by no shadow of a doubt, the most talented actress in cinema. Ariel Gade provides the cute little girl role, and adds a performance on par with the best Hollywood has to offer. With a fairly large role, at age 9 (I think), she pulls it off brilliantly.The only issue I have with the movie is that fact that it has been promoted as a horror movie, yet the emphasis is far more on character relationships.In the style that you doctor would STRONGLY recommend you taking some rest, I STRONGLY recommend that you see this movie, but bear in mind though, that horror is not on the menu.A movie that stays in your mind for days after its screening suggests 10/10.

		<fullReview>Wow, that was one long boring movie. The original "Dark Water" was one of the better Asian horror movies. Not very logical, but creepy and effective. American remakes tend to take the original premise and go over the top with it. That's not at all the case with this movie. Walter Salles' version of "Dark Water" is even more stripped of any shock elements. You have to give him credit for trying to make the movie his own instead of copying the original sequence by sequence, but Salles cut the best scenes out and his attempts to create atmosphere aren't successful at all. Just because it's raining all the time and the whole film is covered in dark green/gray doesn't automatically make it atmospheric. It's just an inanely obvious way to build a theme that matches the title. The story itself moves so slowly and uneventfully that we are virtually (and vainly) begging for some cheap scare to keep us interested. There are no plot points whatsoever. Characters are introduced arbitrarily, they do things without a reason and in the end we're presented a solution that's only slightly explicable if you've seen the original and know what the story is supposed to be about. Jennifer Connelly and the rest of the fine cast do their best to save "Dark Water", but they're fighting against windmills. This movie couldn't even scare my girlfriend and that's saying a lot, because she is freaked out by even the tamest ghost stories. So, don't waste your time on this and go see the original instead.</fullReview>

I also liked the plot and the whole storyline of it and especially the drama of this mother. I believe that Jennifer Connelly who plays as Dahlia makes a really nice interpretation as also John C. Reilly does. I think that Walter Salles did a really great job in the direction of this movie and this is something that is really obvious in whole of the movie.Finally I have to say that the difference of the plot in this movie is something that makes "Dark Water" more epic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, let me say that as remakes go, I'm not a fan. it seems difficult to me to replicate any movie, mores the point how(or why)could you or would you attempt to improve something that has its own identity and mark? Hollywood are the prime bad example of remaking Asian horror movies to an almost laughable degree - even if the original was not brilliant, you can be sure Hollywood wont improve it. and then i saw 'Dark Water', and believe me when i tell you that this is the one of the darkest, subtlest psychological horror movies I've ever seen (and I've seen a few). The basic story is this: a woman(Jennifer Connelly)and her daughter, in the middle of a divorce move to a run down area of new york to an apartment block thats within her budget. as the story progresses we begin to understand that something is not quite right with her apartment, and the difficulties that she goes through to raise her daughter and battle through her divorce. its subtle; oh so subtle and the atmosphere is built up in layers; its neither silly or cheesy but creepy enough for you know SOMETHING is happening. the director never gets impatient and throws anything unnecessary at us; we are allowed to get beneath the surface of these people and understand why they are feeling the way they are. for that alone this is a notch above most modern horror movies, and despite the feeble IMDb rating i would urge anybody with half a brain to see this movie and understand that atmosphere (john carpenter anyone?)is what makes the best horror movies. if you want blood and mindless gore, then go hire 'friday the 13th', otherwise go see this and prepare for the hairs to most likely stand up on your neck! Simply brilliant 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're looking for your typical teen horror, which consists of two eighteen year old big breasted blondes, running up and down staircases while a man in a white mask chases them with a chainsaw, then you've rented the wrong movie. Although it may not have any of these elements, it does however actually have a story behind it. The story however, is not the best.However well written the script may be, I was not enthralled with it, and certainly not on the edge of my seat throughout the entirety of the film. There is no blood or guts, so again, it's not that kind of film, but it does have a lot of real, genuine acting which is hard to find in most horror films. It's better than a lot of seen recently and it does have a certain je'nais ce que. I believe it was originally an Asian film, and this is the remake. Jennifer Connelly was outstanding, and I'm a little surprised she didn't get more noteability for her skills in the film. Her acting was one of the best I've seen in a long time. John C. Reilly was also one of the many players, and was surprisingly really good as an annoying real estate agent. Dougary Scott also played the ex-husband to Jennifer Connelly and I found him to be good, although not the choice I would have made for the role. All in all it was a good film. A little dry and slow at times, but aren't all of the films in this genre that way? A good story, with a little unimportant moments, and scary tactics that sometimes weren't scary while other times pretty predictable.But, if you're interested in the film, it wouldn't hurt to check it out, it's fairly good, and not a bad for a rental. But, unfortunately, I'd say that's as far as I would go with regards to the movie. Merely just a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A well acted movie, but not as scary as I would have liked. The movie is mainly about a mother-child relationship, love, and sacrifice. The ghost story, to me, just seems to be a vehicle or back drop for this and not so much to scare or horrify. I don't know if this was the intent of the writer(s) of this thing or if it was a horror movie that just fell flat at the end for lack of imagination which was my initial impression.It's my experience that it's easier to start something than to finish it. If we are talking about a book or a movie, more imagination is required at the end than in the beginning and middle. In fact, it's better to finish better than you started rather than the other way around. How many times have you read a book or seen a movie that was interesting to you but towards the end you got the impression that the people involved just lost interest or creativity and just wanted to "wrap things up"? Happens to me all the time g*ddamn it! You feel like such a BIG SUCKER when it does; like you were "lured" or something.Still, as I said, the movie is convincingly acted and Jennifer Connelly was sympathetic and easy on the eyes. I felt sorry for her during the whole movie. A woman on her own with limited funds and a bitter separation getting no help and putting up with a lot of crap. If you're looking for a movie to scare the hell out of you, this is not it. If you want to see a mystery ( what happened to so and so) and an attractive single mother having to fend for herself and her child as she deals with curious and interesting -if not particularly scary- doings in a crappy building, then this movie is for you.

		<shortDescription>Deep Dark Water</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dark Water, the first English language movie directed by Brazilian Walter Salles (Central Station, Motorcycle Diaries) is a very good movie. This is the type of intelligent non-slasher horror films that I enjoy. Its power is not in showing gore and roaring monsters but in the creating the atmosphere of unbearable tension and in making the very familiar everyday things and situations ominous, gloomy, and ready to hurt. Dark Water is also about very real and sympathetic characters, a young single mother and her little girl, and the bond and love between them. It is about real monsters of abuse, negligence, and criminal indifference that could and would affect a child's future life and lead to the tragic event at some point. I did not see the original Japanese movie of which Dark Water is a remake but I found this remake set in the creepiest apartment building on the Roosevelt Island, NY imaginable, a very underrated, good on its own merits and certainly worth watching drama/psychological thriller with the elements of supernatural thriller. Acting is first class. Jennifer Connelly in a truly heartbreaking performance as a recently divorced woman trying to move on together with her little daughter deserves a special mention and respect. John C. Reilly, Tim Roth, Pete Postlethwait, and Dougray Scott all made their characters interesting and memorable. It was nice to see Camryn Manheim in a small cameo. Two young girls also were very good. The camera work by Alfonso Beato, who more recently shot the award winning films "All About My Mother" (1999) "Ghost World" (2001), "The Queen" (2006), and &#x201c;Love in the Time of Cholera&#x201d; is amazing. The apartment where Dahlia and Cecil moved, had a strong and scary personality, and could be consider another very important film's character. If I add that the original music to the film was written by Angelo Badalamenti, the usual David Lynch's collaborator, you'd have a good idea of the surreal dark atmosphere of the film. I recommend it but do not expect a pure horror flick. Dark Water is deeper than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reasonable, But Absolutely Unnecessary Remake of a Great Japanese Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In New York City, Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) has just divorced from her husband and is disputing the custody of their daughter Cecilia (Ariel Gade). She has a very restricted budget, so she moves with Cecilia to an old small apartment in Roosevelt Island near Manhattan. She does not pay attention to a stain of water on the ceiling of the bedroom, but once living in the place, she realizes that there is a drip of dark water in the bedroom and she asks the landlord to repair the leakage. Meanwhile, Cecilia finds a red Hello Kitty bag on the terrace, and Dahlia returns it to the administrator. In school, the teacher tells Dahlia that Cecilia has an imaginary friend called Natasha. Along the days, Dahlia has severe migraines and nightmares, while disputing her daughter in the justice and having troubles in the apartment. Dahlia decides to investigate further, and she faces a tragic accident.The original "Honogurai Mizu No Soko Kara" (2002) is a tense low-paced scary Japanese movie. Following the present fashion of Hollywood, i.e., remake of Japanese horror movies, Brazilian director Walter Salles made a reasonable, but absolutely unnecessary remake of the great Japanese original movie. This version is more dramatic, while the Japanese one is scarier and spookier. The good thing of this remake is the presence of Jennifer Connelly, of whom I am a great fan, and the young actress Ariel Gade, with an excellent performance. If you have the chance to make a choice, prefer the original Japanese movie, in spite of the subtitles. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Água Negra" ("Black Water")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tend to agree much more with Berardinelli than Ebert on this one. This was not a masterpiece, just an average, decently done horror flick. I agree Jennifer Connelly is very good in her role, and so is the little girl playing the daughter. Also the cinematography is quite good, the gloomy atmosphere can almost be felt while watching the movie.The main problem however is the story. It is way over the top, in my opinion it doesn't hold water, the ghost part is totally unbelievable to me. Why don't they stick to real things, there are more than enough vary scary things in real life. Why always go for the supernatural? It is probably only me, but I was rather disappointed. This movie could have been much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely achieves suspense. Cover your eyes and your ears.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this movie is not the greatest horror/thriller movie ever, it has its moments. I did a good bit of covering my eyes, and the soundtrack was scary enough that I wanted to cover my ears too. The idea of the water was a neat theme, and it definitely brought back memories of the blood pouring from the elevator in "The Shining".(Minor Spoiler) There are not really any major plot twists, which is something that you typically like to see in such movies. I suppose there is an attempt at a twist, but it isn't quite twisty enough, I guess.The reason the movie doesn't get less than 6 is because it is, in fact, scary. And because Jennifer Connelly is easy to watch in just about anything she does. She acts well. The little girl is pretty weak. Tim Roth is decent, but his character is very loosely developed and the motives for his actions and behavior aren't particularly clear. John C. Reilly and Pete Postlethwait are both great, and believable in their roles.I think with a better script, and a better little girl, and perhaps a little more development of Natasha's character, this could have been a *great* movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best of the Japanese-inspired horrors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dark Water, is another film based on a Japanese film of the same name (in the same spirit as The Grudge and The Ring). However, unlike the other two mentioned films, this one didn't leave me inspired or even scared. It was also VERY slow (I don't know if this was because of the pacing or just the script trying to stretch itself into a feature length at 103 minutes). I do think Jennifer Connelly does a great job (she was superb in A Beautiful Mind and Dark City - the first film I ever saw her in). I really don't know why she picked this role because it really doesn't do her justice. If you want to see a better Japanese-inspired horror film, then see the aforementioned films - The Grudge and The Ring (but not The Ring 2!). 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched Dark Water when I was staying my summer with my family in Newfoundland. Me, my sister, my aunt Kelly, and her friend Lisa rented Dark Water because we thought it looked interesting. We picked a good choice. I didn't know what it was about so I stayed and watched. This isn't a horror film. It is an interesting drama/mystery/thriller with an interesting ending.When I came back I asked my friends what they did over the summer and brought up movies. I said I saw a lot of movies and asked them about Dark Water. I asked them if they wanted to see it and they replied, "No, I hate movies about sharks!" I just stared and said, "It is NOT about sharks!" People think it is about sharks because of the title. But this movie has a LOT of potential and a highly original plot. I prefer this to the original because Connelly shows an excellent performance. Ariel Gade was adorable and she was quite impressive and convincing as Ceci, Connelly's daughter. Gade and Connelly are the main characters and they make a great team. I adored this movie. Finally I get something watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as scary as the trailer makes you think but it is a slightly good thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a film by the creators of the Japanese version of the "The Ring" comes this haunting, chilling, film about a young mother who won't stop anything and find out what is going on in the floor above and to save her daughter. Jennifer Connelly stars as Dhalia in this eerie thriller. Areil Gade co stars as Dhalia's daughter, known as Ceci. Dhalia is going through a hard time. She is going through a divorce settlement and her ex husband wants to keep her daughter. Now she wants to move on with her life and so she decides to move in an apartment with her daughter and start a new life. But once Dhalia starts noticing that there are leaks with a strange color she feels something isn't right. Now her daughter, Ceci begins to act like a different person. Dhalia wants to know what is going on and she won't stop until she finds out.I really liked Jennifer Connelly's performance. I thought this was the right role for the film and that she played it right. Another person I want to talk about is Areil Gade. She is only about 8 years old I think and she is a bright, wonderful upcoming actress. She could be the next Dakota Fanning. If Areil begins to appear in any movies, she'll have a wonderful career.Dark Water is from the Japenese writer of "The Ring" and "The Skeleton Key". All three movies have good lead actresses but I felt that Dark Water was better than The Skeleton Key but not as good as The Ring. This movie did leave my asking questions to myself but The Skeleton Key made me ask more. I did like this movie, but I wanted this to be a scarier movie. A lot of people missed out on this. It wasn't s big hit over the summer of release, but this was a pretty decent movie. I would give it a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unexpected pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The real surprise in this film is the level of care and intelligence involved. This genre too often dispenses with credible character and dialogue as if they were plot obstacles. Dark Water has a distinct lack of "why would she go down to the cellar?" moments. The script didn't require Jennifer Connelly to disintegrate at every turn, or to suddenly undergo rapid personality changes. So she was able to portray a troubled character without histrionics. You wont find many other films like this where the supporting characters are so well fleshed out, or played by such a great cast. Particularly enjoyable is John C Reilly's oily sales pitch when he shows the apartment.Another striking feature is the use of location and lighting. The dingy and oppressive apartment block has a presence of its own. Again this is handled with an intelligence and subtlety that is rare. The apartment block is no Gothic monstrosity or urban war zone, just cheap and grim in a way that is utterly credible.So you don't get the usual - shocks and scares that leave you feeling cheated by plot holes, and unlikely actions of the characters. Instead you get a disturbing and well crafted gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dark Water" never had one single worthy review here in Brazil. This is odd, because Walter Salles is at least one of the three best Brazilian director's nowadays (the other two are, of course, Bianchi and Meirelles). And what the three have in common? They do political inspired, remarkable real movies. OK, Meirelles had his dream of an international career come true with all the success of "The Constant Gardnerer" and Bianchi approach to the Brazilian national sufferings is too much acid to foreigners. That is only a/mine own point of view. But the fact is that here in Brazil some were expecting a bit more of the candy flavor of "Central Station", some the "hunger esthetic's" of "Behind The Sun", yet others the political idealism of "The Motorcycle Diaries". Those were all Salles' personal projects, somewhat embedded on Brazilian's "Cinema Novo" tradition. Salles has more to offer. Those who saw "!Foreign Land" -- perhaps his masterpiece -- may have noticed all other influences that this well-born, well-educated and incredibly intelligent man is capable of agglutinate on a movie. That is what "Dark Water" really has to show. A South-American director who really knows how to direct actors, to cut his films and to deliver a product that is not as simple or straight as it seems. "Dark Water" is a film of several layers of understanding, a horror movie that happens inside the head of the characters, a game of suspicion and discovering AND a realistic divorce story. Extremely well photographed and cut, led by awesome actors and with a sublime touch of a suffocating music score, "Dark Water" is an achievement yet to be fully appreciated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NOT NECESSARILY SPOILERS. I put spoilers cuz there is one thing I said in regards to Ceci; however I'm not exactly sure if it qualifies as a spoiler. Anyways, I rented this movie because it looked intriguing and I am a big fan of Jennifer Connelly, yet I also found that the little girl named Ariel Gade, who played Ceci, did an extraordinary job as well. Her performance in that movie was just like a performance Dakota Fanning would have delivered at that age, and if you've seen "I am Sam" you'll know what I mean. Even though Ariel's role wasn't as thorough as Dakota's was, she was amazing in acting it out. As for the story, I loved it. I thought it was really moving. It really showed the relationship between Dahlia and her daughter Ceci; which was an essential part of the story. Another powerful part was the relationship between Dahlia and her mother and Jennifer Connelly delivered a really powerful performance in relation to that. I do not feel that this movie was intended to be a flat out horror flick in any way. Yes, it can be really spooky, but wasn't really intended to have the audience walking away shaking. I feel that this is what separates this movie from "The Ring," which did not really have as much emotional content as "Dark Water" and was meant to leave the audience horrified. When I finished watching "Dark Water" I cried because I could really understand how Ceci felt and the ending was breathtaking for those really emotional viewers. If you could really get into the relationship between Dahlia and Ceci I think you will most likely cry. This is what really put the icing on the cake for me. I gave this movie a ten because any movie that I walk away from with tears in my eyes is completely worth my time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen both versions of the movie and I find the original to be much better than the American remake. The Japanese version had a slow but continuous buildup of the character the American version just kinda rushed you through the dramatics especially on the later part of the movie. It is true that the American version of the movie was marketed as a horror film which it definitely is not the Japanese version had more style and flair it made you think more unlike the American version which just basically told you what the little Natasha wanted which is a mommy. I know the Amercian film industry as of late have not had really good original movies and the only thing they do is either make a remake of someone else's movie (and 99% not that good either)or create a part 2 of a recently produced movie. I say stick to the original and you will be more satisfied and sad to say there are not a lot of good American movies as of late.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the original, but still really good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, it is necessary to say that this was originally not meant to be a horror film. I can tell from the movie and interviews with the director I've read that he did not intend this to be horror. But it's obvious that the studio pressured Salles to throw in some (very out of place) cheap jump scenes. Second thing is, despite having some very out of place jumps and a few flaws here and there, "Dark Water" is a gem.This is a remake of the very good Japanese film "Honogurai Mizu no soko Kara" from Hideo Nakata (J-Horror fans like me worship him as a master because of "Ring(u)"). I liked this movie because instead of becoming a pointless shot-for-shot remake, it took the basics of the original story and made something new out of it. So really, it loses the point of being called a remake. Instead of becoming just another ghost story, the audience can suspect that the main character is mentally unstable. That's what I saw, and the movie made a lot more sense that way. The highest point of the movie was the acting: out a very strong cast, Jennifer Connelly's acting is excellent. Ariel Gade, who played Ceci, did a great job and will probably be successful if she continues acting.If your looking for a scary horror story, go watch the original film. This is a beautiful, touching, and sad look at a woman who's fighting to the extreme to save her child, and will do anything.</fullReview>

Building the suspense over the entirety of the film, till the inevitable climax. This film unluckily went in the opposite direction, opting more for lackluster attempts at suspense throughout the film till the BIG climax at the end.Overall the movie was not bad. The acting was good (especially Pete Postlethwaite) as well as the cinematography and sets.

		<shortDescription>The paranormal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film portrays the paranormal as a far more superior form of malignance and terror than the secular... for instance, we'd choose the street punks over some superntural force any time - and at one point we are a step ahead of Dahlia when we, as the audience are privy to what Ceci knows.The film is layered with some backstory that add dimension to our heroine. Connelly gives so much intensity to the role, she is as brilliant as she is beautiful in this film. We've seen her finally break down in A BEAUTIFUL MIND, or be consumed with bitter rage in SAND AND FOG, and she portrays a mixture of those same kinds of emotions very well in this film.One surprisingly above par performance is by Tim Roth. He brings moodiness and caustic wit to his character - the lawyer. John C. Reilly does a fine job too. This doesn't have a Hollywood ending, and without spoiling anything for those who wanted to see Ring 2 have concluded opposite to what it had, they will be pleased with DARK WATER's denouement - though I haven't seen any of the Japanese versions of both Hideo-Nakata based American-remade pieces. But just because isn't a Hollywood-ending doesn't mean it is absent of a feel-good resolve. This drama has it. And it manages to make you uneasy and catatonic in a lot of it's moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Both Connelly and Ariel Gade (Ceci) put up an interesting performance with so much chemistry, even though Connelly had had lost a considerable amount of weight to the point of having a Native-American visage, which contributed to a bizarre out-of-place atmosphere.Having the story taking place in a bleak East River island proved to be wise and worked to provide more events and characters-wise alike. Take the janitor for instance; it is very much unlikely to find such failing apartments or even such careless janitors in Japan, let alone being corrupt deep-outside to the point of driving everyone paranoid, including the viewers, from the moment he appears on cadre. The same goes for the utility worker and generally the majority of the extras. On the other side, the Japanese original had all those characters in rather secondary roles, almost to the point of not affecting the storyline at all.The abyssal bleakness and gloominess of America's East River, New York, with its cold-hearted on-screen people aided in drawing compassion with the helpless, yet struggling, Dahlia Williams and her cause.The climax and ending were far better than those found in the original Nakata Hideo version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing I appreciate about Japanese horror movies and their remakes is the importance given to atmosphere - they are more interested in creating a creepy mood than in showing fountains of blood and piles of corpses. But this laudable intention can be taken too far, and such is the case with Dark Water. The original movie by Hideo Nakata at least featured a genuinely chilling moment near the end; this remake is basically a continuous build-up, a long tease, except the scary climax has been watered down.Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) moves with her daughter Ceci (Ariel Grade) to an apartment on Roosevelt Island. The place is lugubrious, the building handyman (Pete Postlethwaite) unhelpful, and unsettling events start to happen.It's not much of a reveal for the remake of a Japanese horror movie to say the house is haunted by the ghost of a child - seriously, what else it could have been? There are actually dozens of weird and unique creatures ("y&#x14d;kai") in Japanese folklore: show a little variety, scriptwriters.Beautiful Jennifer Connelly, she of the piercing green eyes, gives a powerful performance as a desperate woman faced with inexplicable events; young Ariel Grade is convincing. The rest of the cast is fine but wasted. Actors like Postlethwaite, Tim Roth (as a nice lawyer - an unusual character!) and John C. Reilly (the sleazy manager of the apartment building) are too good for the parts given here.Direction by Salles is effective, with the use of a lurid colour palette to convey the eerie atmosphere of the building, but the mistake during the climax is unforgivable: without giving away spoilers, I'll just say the impact is nowhere close to the original.Kubrick made a brilliant horror movie (The Shining) which portrayed both the dissolution of familiar bonds AND handled supernatural elements magnificently, but Salles - however skilled - is no Kubrick, and Dark Water is most certainly not The Shining.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a Drama than a Horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Needless to say, when you go into this movie, you expect a good horror movie. Well, prepared to be deceived. Dark Water has much more of a tragedy than a horror...The story revolves around Cecila (Cecy) and her mother, Dahila. Dahila, is a mother who recently is just divorced, fighting over her daughter from her ex-husband. She moves to a lesser part of town where there is a school and an apartment complex. The movie focuses much of its energy on their apartment building and that god-forsaken leek in the bedroom. This remake isn't as good as "The Ring", and nor does it really screw with you like that movie.The plus about this movie...it has more of a story than "pop out and scare you" and it has more of a deeper connection towards anyone who can really associate with Dahila and Ceclia's situation. The characters are certainly not perfect, they have their greater flaws. For instance, Dahila tends to be a little spineless...and never really takes charge of the situation. The lawyer she hires to get full custody of her daughter is a charming character. He has is office in his car. He explains that he's moving to another office, but whether this is true or not can be arguable. He reminds me of my former lawyer too.The drawback of this movie it takes forever to progress to the actual climax. The story can also be a double-edged sword the way they marketed this movie as a very scary movie, using "The Author of The Ring" to their full extent. People looking for a movie similar to "The Ring" are going to be disappointed. The slow, melodramatic approach will bore people after a while and it nearly put my friend to sleep in the set right next to me. Needless to say, I was disappointed, wondering who and what was the ghost causing all the problems with the water. Surprise, its just a little girl...a normal looking girl...who was abandoned by her parents...a la Dahila. The movie leaves off at a weird note that has you questioning "WTF JUST HAPPENED?!".Personally, I did like this movie. I liked it because it was more than a horror movie, it had an actual story. The acting was very good. The little 8-year-old girl who played Cecila was just too cute. She had a resounding "awww" from all the women in the audience. Jennifer Connely was a great actress. She's very pretty, but she was damn good in this movie. The connections to child abuse, ghosts and imaginary friends, and martial separation were probable the most terrible horrors in this movie. I was nearly in tears when the teacher was explaining that Cecila had to go see a child psychologist in the movie. The dark water...was disgusting leaking in the above building. Interestingly enough, water is supposed to be scared and clear away spirits in Japanese lore. I guess dirty water was an oxymoron, along with the vengeful "yueri" in this case. Also, I kept thinking of the stories of "La Llorona" in this movie.As for this movie...1. If you're looking for a good scary movie, you'll be disappointed. Don't get your hopes up. 2. If you're looking for a horror movie with more depth, here's your pick. 3. This movie takes a while to progress, prepare yourself for slow dialogs. 4. Anyone who can associate with the characters can see the automatic connection to everything.All and all, I give "Dark Water" a "B-". It was a great movie, I was disappointed a little because of the story, and advertisement place too much of an emphasis on a terrifying horror movie that was never there. But thank your lucky stars that this movie has an actual story...and it might leave you bored.</fullReview>

As long as you enter the theatre expecting to see a drama mystery, you should be happy.*A little side note to those who criticize any American remakes of Asian films and will never be satisfied: 1) Remember that the American remake is more true to the original Japanese film than the Japanese film was to the original Japanese novel! 2) At least the Asian film makers are making a profit from selling the rights (unlike the countless Asian remakes of American films without buying the rights) 3) Any remake made is a nod back to the original film and is introducing new fans to Asian cinema who otherwise wouldn't even know of its existence 4) And if you STILL hate Americans, remember: no one FORCED the Japanese film makers to sell the rights and make a S**T load off the American remake by sitting on their butts.

		<fullReview>OK, the film had such potential, being from the writer of a fairly scary film, and looks so slick and creepy but it immediately falls on a familiar story, with clichéd locations and characters (sorry, the janitor is fun but too overused for my liking). The film spends nearly 40 mins just showing off the apartment and sets up the story until around the 50 minute mark, which could have been good but the set-up is slightly laking and has many shades of films like The Ring (apartments are a real complex for the writer, aren't they?) and The Brood. The film does have a few tense moments and interesting characters (the lawyer especially) but I never really felt involved enough with the characters to care for it as a drama or in enough suspense to think of it as a horror. It didn't seem to know what it wanted to be. It was good but it could have been better. if you come across this film on TV and have 100 minutes to spare, by all means watch it, but don't be prepared for anything more than a by the numbers drama and suspense film (can't call it a horror, sorry) combined (fairly well) with a pretty predictable finalé and long-winded ending. A decent and very beautiful and polished film, but really of little more than TV standards story-wise.</fullReview>

She does NOT crawl out of anything and she looks normal.The cinematography was great. It was a beautiful movie. The acting was great. I won't be surprised if this movie merits an Oscar nomination.

As a comparison, those movies which had originally used elements that I mentioned in the 2nd paragraph in no way shape or form had the talent that Connelly brought to this character.I only wish that I could give the movie a 7, which would mean it's satisfactory.

Yes, it's a remake of a Japanese horror flick, but it's directed by an art-house veteran (Walter Salles, whose "Central Station" ranks near the top of character-driven foreign-language films of the past ten years). Yes, like "The Ring Two" and so many other horror films, it's essentially about a mother/parent on the verge of insanity, but never has one of these films provided so much rich psychological background and exposition. Jennifer Connelly, in the lead role as a mother in the midst of an emotional breakdown and brutal custody battle over her young daughter, gives a performance as powerful and heartbreaking as the one she did in "House of Sand and Fog." This is not the type of performance or character development you would normally get in a film like this, and it's a nice surprise.However, as a horror film it mostly falls flat. There's some great atmosphere in the setting on Manhatten's Roosevelt Island. Not since Chicago's Cabrini Green housing projects in "Candyman" has an apartment complex been so hauntingly photographed and used to such artistically satisfying levels. But most of the film is water-logged both figuratively and literally. Gauzed in the razor-thin sheen of a classy ghost story (like some many recent films revolving around a dead little girl ), "Dark Water" is really about coping with being abandoned by your mother...a depressing real life horror many children face. As such, this film will mostly disappoint genre fans, but leave discerning and patient viewers with some things to think about thanks to the haunting visuals and Jennifer Connelly's powerhouse performance. Nobody does "superficially strong yet emotionally fragile middle-class women in the midst of crisis" like Connelly, and all type-casting aside, she's worth the price of admission alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Dark Water' falls on the same category as 'The Ring'. It's got the usual haunting of a mother and child, the exaggerated background score, bad weather, very similar plot line with a ridiculous twist in the end etc. I liked the camera-work but 'Dark Water' also tries to pull off a 'Panic Room' by using the house as the element of fear. Hollywood's new obsession seems to be remaking South Asian films. Unlike the Japanese version, this one has plenty of jump moments and the score is very intrusive, while in Nakata's version it was slightly more subtle and thus easier to be involved in but this one isn't a great film either. What really made me sit through it till the end was Jennifer Connelly's performance. In my opinion, she's always been a dependable actress and her acting here is solid. She saves this film from being a forgettable, almost B-grade, horror flick. I also liked the tone of the film and how the washed out colour was used to stress on the gloominess and loneliness. But otherwise, there isn't much to like about 'Dark Water'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good (and much better than the original)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had very low expectations for "Dark Water (2005)". The recent Hollywood craze of making horror movies for the teens (remakes of Japanese horror in particular) produced some of the worst movies I've ever seen. In addition, I already watched the original "Dark Water (2002)" and really hated it (it had good atmosphere, but I found it very boring and the plot to be silly and predictable).Unlike many remakes, this movie is actually much better than its origin (in my opinion, of course). It doesn't work like most recent horror movies; in fact, I'm not sure it's supposed to be a horror movie at all (although it's being promoted as one). It works more like a psychological thriller.There is a very good acting by the entire cast: Jennifer Connelly is gorgeous as ever and really carries the movie - she is very convincing, even in the more-clichéd situations; Pete Postlethwaite and John C. Reilly are both good as the sleazy guys; Camryn Manheim (from "Happiness") behaves like she's been a teacher for years; Ariel Gade is surprisingly good for a 7-year old in her second feature film; And I didn't even recognize Tim Roth as the lawyer who runs his office from the car.Director Walter Salles and writer Rafael Yglesias did a good job in avoiding many of the cheesy horror movies tricks and creating good atmosphere. A major contribution to this atmosphere is the wonderful score by Angelo Badalamenti.While not a masterpiece, this movie does show that remakes can be done well and sometimes even surpass their origin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Desperate mother fights for custody of her daughter whilst fighting off her own demons and the ones in her apartment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic premise of this movie is Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) is going through a bitter custody battle, with Kyle (Dougray Scott), to keep custody of her daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade). She moves into an apartment block with the hope that having her own place and a good school nearby will help her chances of custody. The problem is the the building is run down and in desperate need of a paint job. This is when things start to get spooky. A big water stain appears on the ceiling and she keeps hearing footsteps upstairs. To Dahlia's despair she find out that nobody is living in the apartment above her and begins to question her sanity. Meanwhile her daughter, Ceci, begins to have spooky episodes at school and insists that her imaginary friend, Natasha, is responsible. With Dahlia on the verge of breaking point and Ceci beginning to show similar behaviour, are they both going crazy? Are the spooky goings on really happening or is it just Dahlia feeling bad because she herself was abandoned? Will it ever stop raining? This movie is the best Japanese remake of the bunch, namely The Ring, The Grudge. Many people have compared it to the American Ring Two movie but this is mostly because Ring Two borrowed quite a bit from the original Japanese version of Dark Water and also because Hideo Nakata directed both the original Dark Water and the American version of Ring Two. It has managed to take the original Japanese version and adapt it successfully although it still maintains elements of Japanese horror. I think this is why there have been mixed reviews of Dark Water. Many Japanese horror movies have a strong element of drama in them with an injection of scary scenes and moments. This helps us to care about what is happening to the characters. So this is exactly what Dark Water is. It allows us to empathise with Dahlia as she begins to lose her mind and her daughter. The acting in this movie is pretty good. Jennifer Connelly does a good job of convincing us that she's a mother at the point of breaking. Ariel Gade is able to be cute and convincing without driving us up the wall. We see small glimpses into the other characters lives and they are all equally interesting. If you are looking for an entertaining fast pace horror movie with lots of death then you've come to the wrong place. If however you're looking for an in depth look at a mother trying to keep custody of her daughter whilst fighting off her own demons and some more, then this movie is for you. It may also appeal to people who have seen the original Japanese version as it gives a clearer understanding and less ambiguous ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>okay i went to the movies yesterday with a friend without knowing what we were gonna watch. So we checked the schedule and there it was Dark Water was starting eight then, so we hurry and went. I thought it'd be just a ring two remake kinda of thing, because all the water and the little girl and the mommy thing, i know this is earlier to the ring two, but it was a completely different thing. It's not a horror movie, it's a drama with some scares in it. The performance by all of the actors is amazing. Specially Jennifer COnnelly who I used to hate, but know that I've seen her here it's just... Then of course the director, a brilliant director, who have a different look to the movie and it was the greatest thing of all. Yes the story is a bit i've been there, but it works you know. Little spooky girls, frightened and alone mommy, scaring house, water... IT ALL WORKS and with the plus of the drama thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie was fairly good. i don't regret paying my 6 bucks for it. however, i couldn't help noticing the major similarities between dark water and the ring 2. but centered around an evil young girl who wanted to possess the life of a happy youngster, and then receive the undying love of that child's mother. both ended happily, which saddens me, because one of the main reason i loved was because up its shocking and malevolent ending. the camera shots were almost exactly like the ring 1 and 2 and dark water brought nothing new and interesting to the screen. what i really want to know is if the writer of all these books the movies are based on intended for them to be so similar, or if it was just an unfortunate mistake.all in all i have to say that dark water came out above the ring 2, however in my opinion only one of these movies should have been made, maybe then the audience wouldn't be so disappointed in both</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the original and the remake was definitely up-to-par with that. It had such talent behind the picture and it showed from the acting, direction, cinematography, and overall atmosphere. . Conelley did a fantastic job with her part. She plays fragile characters so well, like she showed in 'Requiem and 'Sand and Fog. Reilly did a good job and so did Dahlia, the daughter. I thought some of the elements were handled better. Like: the relationship between mother and daughter was stronger and more powerful. This made the decision the mother makes at the end, so much harder. I still loved this remake. Just loved the original more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ring Redux</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How desperate is Hollywood these days? How anxious are they to get a creepy Japenese- originated 'Ring'-like horror picture with a PG-13 rating out in the theaters so it can score #1 at the box office with ticket sales from the teenage crowd? They must be very desperate, indeed, because the latest one 'Dark Water' is nothing but a jumbled, confusing and frustrating migraine of a suspense picture, with really no suspense. The film doesn't even begin to get a tad bit interesting, until an hour and a half has already passed (the movie runs for one hour and forty-five minutes). 'Dark Water' is a terrible failure, with only fifteen minutes of true suspense and ninety minutes of pointless filler. I was extremely disappointed with 'Dark Water' after reading so many positive reviews. I was expecting a cast filled with such strong actors as Jennifer Connelly, Tim Roth, John C. Reilly, Dougary Scott and Pete Postelwaithe to really lift this picture up, but the movie was so bland and lame their acting talents couldn't. I don't know if I was ever as bored in a movie theater before today.The story (based on a tired formulaic novel by Japanese hack Koji Suzuki), follows Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) and her daughter, Ceci (Ariel Gade). Dahlia and her husband Kyle (Dougary Scott) are going through an awful and dirty divorce and are fighting over custody. Kyle is shacked up with another honey over in Jersey City, and Dahlia is trying to find an affordable apartment in Manhattan for her and her daughter. After a long time of searching, Dahlia and her daughter come across a rusty, depressing looking apartment building just on the outskirts on Manhattan with a spare room. They are shown the apartment by the building lying, two-faced sleaze ball super Mr. Murray (John C. Reilly), who tries desperately to condescend the two into thinking it's a beautiful apartment, when it's really tired, dull and very creepy looking. Dahlia ends up getting the apartment, and when she does strange occurrences start to happen starting with a water leak in the ceiling. It's coming from the upstairs apartment 10 F, but no one lives there... (oooohhhh, creepy)! Not. There's no creepy-looking little girl who kills people in this thriller, just a normal boring looking ghost girl who couldn't scare a ninety year old woman on dialysis. The movie tries to scare you with free flowing water that is black! Oh, my god! How frightening! Yeah, right. It seems whenever you are expecting something freaky and delightfully disturbing to happen in this so-called horror flick, something so indescribably wearisome happens. The film really doesn't build up adequate suspense or interest till the concluding fifteen minutes where it's absolutely crazy. I mean crazy as interesting and scary, but also mindless and cliché too. There is really no aspect of 'Dark Water' that is original and that's a shame. Brazilian director Walter Salles does the best he can with the besotted and dim-witted screenplay. It's a major step down for Salles after directing last year's foreign-indie favorite 'The Motorcycle Diaries', which earned a Best Foreign Film nomination at the Academy Awards in March. Jennifer Connelly is solid as to be expected, but even her dead-on performance can't save the movie from it's tedious and simple-minded formula. Tim Roth is a good addition to the cast as Connelly's typical lawyer, Dougary Scott is okay for his very limited camera time, Camryn Manheim is well, Camryn Manheim as Ceci's school teacher, Pete Postelwaithe (aka Koboyashi) adds an interesting creep factor to his character, and John C. Reilly is hysterical and always fun to watch as the sneaky low-life that is Mr. Murray. Reilly plays up his role tremendously, and by doing so is probably the best part of the scatterbrained feature.When it's all over, I felt very let down and confused. The movie is hard to follow, and almost impossible to take seriously. It isn't as horrible as last year's stinker 'The Grudge', but it still is a bad movie. For all the talent behind 'Dark Water', it never impresses or entices. I have to say I was very disappointed with this movie, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I wouldn't even dish out $5 bucks for headphones to view it on a plane. If by some perverted chance 'Dark Water' scores #1 at the box office this weekend, I'll hang my head in shame on how tasteless our society has become. Grade: D+ (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, Arizona, 7/8/05)my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece, near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprise! A great Japanese horror remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this film taught me something: just because a film is a remake doesn't necessarily mean that it's bad. Now, DARK WATER has no right to be any good. It's a remake of the Japanese horror film of the same name and as we all know, American remakes of Japanese ghost films are invariably dodgy (think Sarah Michelle Gellar in THE GRUDGE). The astonishing thing is that DARK WATER is a brilliant little film; in this instance I haven't seen the original Japanese movie, but I don't see how it could improve on this.The movie works because it's about people; it's a human drama with real-life characters in situations that almost anybody can identify with. Jennifer Connelly is a delight as the single mother trying to do her best for her young daughter, and her performance of a fragile, slightly disturbed 30-something woman is the key to this movie's success. There's a wonderful ensemble cast who back her up nicely: John C. Reilly as the landlord from hell; Pete Postlethwaite, scene-stealing as the buck-passing janitor; Tim Roth as a divorce lawyer; Dougray Scott as the nasty father.The ghosts themselves end up almost incidental to the thrust of the main story, but the supernatural aspects of the film are well handled and chill-inducing rather than outright shocking. What I liked best was the cinematography: never has a building had so much character as the run-down apartment block on display here. The damp patch on the ceiling is almost a character in itself. Brazilian director Walter Salles handles the rain-sodden locales very well indeed and crafts a spine-tingling atmosphere that propels the film along nicely. Add to this a genuine tearjerker of an ending, the total absence of any needless CGI effects or violence and a pleasingly mature, literate script that caters for an adult rather than teenage audience for once (unlike THE GRUDGE remake) and you have a very good film indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mixed bag of a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forced to stay in a crumbling apartment, a divorcée and her daughter find her new imaginary friend has more sinister motives behind being at the apartment and try to find a way of doing so before her daughter is targeted.Overall this one was a massively bland and boring effort. One of the bigger problems here is the fact that there's just so few ghostly action in this one that it really tends to go on for long periods without anything happening. The focus on the divorce isn't interesting as all it does is bring up the fact that they're not really tolerable towards each other when we first meet them, and their growing animosity doesn't help matters. There's also the numerous problems that comes from living in the apartment together and the other works there, as there's very little here that's appealing in this as almost all of it never really seems designed to showcase scares with the moldy walls inside their rooms, the continually breaking and malfunctioning appliances or how they all affect her mental state here is brought up by staying there as the two are really affected in the apartment which are completely un-scary and don't do anything here to either motive this along at a quick pace or even really make this feel much like a horror film as all of these scenes up front keep the ghostly action confined not only into the second half but also the final few minutes of this one so that so few time s of this one are actually enjoyable these here are what holds this down as there's not a whole lot here to really hold this up otherwise. The final half here is where this kicks off the ghostly action here by putting something behind the few supernatural actions of the previous part of the film so the drowning-level water and the mold spores that keep appearing in the house are all behind the appearance of the ghost girl. Not only is this appearance of the ghost given by the fantastic back-story scene involving the drowning girl in the water-tower which allows this one to go for the great ghostly sequence of the child appearing in the living room while still bathing in the tub which sets up the spectacular sequence of the tow in the drowning bathroom. Still, it's the only real horror scene in this one which does tend to really lower this one as well as well the other flaws here.Rated PG-13: Violence and Language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the mediocre slasher but still has plot holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghost stories are a very common occurrence throughout history. Whether the actual phenomenon was portrayed in a good light or not, most people who believe they saw one get weirded out. Seeing something that looks like the image of a long gone person or animal is kind of strange. In literature, a ghost exists because of not being laid to rest appropriately, a curse or something along those lines. For director Hideo Nakata who has made several Japanese horror films, many producers seem to like remaking his films. In 1998, Nakata released Ringu (1998), which would later become The Ring (2002). During that year, Nakata released another original film of his called Honogurai mizu no soko kara (2002); this would eventually become this film. For what is presented here, it is moderately entertaining but it is nowhere near as being a great ghost feature. However even with that said, it does provide a brief enjoyable deviation from the usual horror tropes.The story is about Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly), a mother going through a divorce with her husband Kyle (Dougray Scott) who are both trying to figure out who will have custody over their daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade). After a counseling session goes wrong between the parents, Dahlia moves with Ceci to a city further away from Kyle. There they settle in old apartment building owned by Mr. Murray (John C. Reilly) and managed handyman Mr. Veeck (Pete Postlethwaite). Upon picking their suite, Dahlia notices the ceiling to her bedroom is leaking water. Within a couple of days the leak becomes worse and Dahlia takes it upon herself to figure out what the problem is on the floor above. Unexpectedly, Dahlia comes into contact with a ghost that not only will make her situation more tense but also jeopardize her daughter's life. The overall narrative penned by Rafael Yglesias (which was most likely just lifted from Nakata's work) feels solid. However, looking deeper into the cracks reveals various continuity errors.The acting and characters work effectively in their designated roles. Both Jennifer Connelly and Dougray Scott are convincing as a troubled couple but also show their love for their daughter as well. Seriously though, poor Dahlia - she goes through so much throughout the running time. On top of that after Dahlia moves to the new city, she's hit with a lawsuit by Kyle so she hires Jeff Platzer (Tim Roth) as her lawyer. Platzer probably shows her the most respect (other than Ceci). The duo of John C. Reilly and Pete Postlethwaite as the apartment managers demonstrates what happens when people don't take care of the property. The best actor of the bunch goes to Ariel Gade. She's the highlight of the feature just because how strong her character is at such an early age. How does one even deal with the events put onto them so well without cracking? It is also because of her innocent nature that she feels like the only one who doesn't have such a dim outlook on life. The ghost is played by Perla Haney-Jardine and although she's doesn't shine as much as Gade, she is creepy.The continuity errors to the script belong to Haney-Jardine's ghost role. Whenever the ghost is around, water begins to get pitch black and gross. However at first, it seems it's only the water in the apartment. Yet when Ceci's at school, the ghost can make the water dark there too ? how? This brings in the other question. Most ghosts are bound by which the place they thrived as a human being. So why is it that she can move to the school but yet is bound only by the apartment? Not making sense here. Another good question that isn't answered (non-continuity related) is where are all the tenants at Mr. Murray's complex? Practically nobody shows his or her face. Does anyone live there and if they do where are they? The creep factor is definitely alive in this film though. Besides the fact that the rating is PG-13, there are a number of good scenes that just involve establishing shots of various places in Dahlia's apartment suite. Plus with the fact that the whole apartment owned by Mr. Murray doesn't look the best, it just adds to the uneasiness of what is being portrayed. Thankfully, there are not a lot of jump scares to this feature.The cinematography shot by Affonso Beato compliments a lot of the scenes dealing with the apartment and rain itself. Throughout the movie, it rains almost the whole time. It is rare that weather sets a tone for a movie but that's what occurs here. The rain immediately does that with its consistency and gloomy grey atmosphere. Another thing to take note of is the lighting used per scene. Much of the colors in each scene have a drained yellowish look to them as if they lack actual life. It's a nice touch. The film score composed by Angelo Badalamenti does its job too. Unlike his first effort in A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987), which consisted of a pure cheap sounding synth performance, this effort is far superior. Badalamenti has a much more organic sound and it uses minimal synth in the back for atmosphere. Actual piano, strings, harps and horns play the rest of the sound. There's also a main theme for the film and it is beautifully tragic highlighted by solo piano keys. A much better listening experience.Its writing has some big plot holes that don't make sense but it doesn't drag the film down entirely. The characters are believable, the creepiness is there (without a ton a of jump scares), the camera-work matches the mood of the story and the music is hauntingly memorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dark Water (2005): Dir: Walter Salles / Cast: Jennifer Connelly, John C. Reilly, Pete Postlethewaite, Dougray Scott, Ariel Gade: Title bears no central reference to the plot other than the water in the run down apartment spews dark water and the body of a young girl is found otherwise it completely subtracts from the core issue. Jennifer Connelly is separated and moves her daughter into an apartment but strange things occur including a bad leakage problem. So far so good until nothing makes sense. Sometimes repetitious but the ending is complete nonsensical crap. Why not concentrate on Connelly's demons growing up with an abusive and neglect mother? Director Walter Salles makes things tense aided by sound effects and ominous use of lighting but no trickery can save this fowl flood mess. Connelly is as talented as she is beautiful but she is more or less a pawn in a very stupid movie. Supporting roles are a complete waste. John C. Reilly plays the apartment owner. Pete Postlethewaite plays the maintenance attendant. Dougray Scott plays Connelly's ex-husband and the role is flat. Ariel Gade plays Connelly's daughter and starring with Connelly is about as good as it gets for her in this dish water film. Everyone of them could have played those roles in their sleep, and for all the good the film is, they might as well have been asleep. Mediocre screenplay should be drown in a toilet.

		<shortDescription>This movie was a stagnant water let-down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early 2000's, Japanese Horror movies remakes were the craze. Remakes like 2002 "The Ring" &amp; 2005's "The Grudge", were making vast money. "Dark Water" directed by Walter Salles hope to be, just as big as them. Based on the 2002 Japanese film, which return is based on Floating Water, a short story by Koji Suzuki. Dark Water showed great promise, but the murky tale about a family menaced by the ghost of young girl who drown at a haunted apartment seem so watered down, and generic predictable that it kinda drown on itself. The movie tries to be stand out, yet be extremely faithful to the 2002 film, but it doesn't work. Lot of the movie feels rehashed and often full of clichés. The movie had good actors, but I really didn't think, that they were giving their 'all' in these roles. Jennifer Connelly as the lead character, Dahlia seem deep, but as the plot moves, it clearly shown to be shallow as hell. Dahlia's backstory as an abused child are never really developed or explored meaningfully in the film. They are simply thrown in to the plot in awkward fashion. Jennifer Connelly really lacks the emotional for this role. Not once, was I convince that she was angry, or she was in fear for her life. I know that her character was taking drugs, and maybe it was there to dull, her extremes, but gees- it really overcast the whole film. She did a lot of stupid things that were really bothering. First off, moving in. Most people, even desperate people, confronted with a situation like that would have moved out after a week. Second off, why didn't she move out, quicker, after the events toward the end? It doesn't make sense, to stay in, and take a bath in a murder house after you found out that there was a dead body in the water tank! For a mom so into her daughter's immediate safety and security. It doesn't make sense that she would live there. The father, Kyle (Dougray Scott) is even worst parent. I really hate, the movie for portraying the father as this creepy controlling over the top figure, and then toward the end, force us to feel sympathetic for him. I really hate, how the movie make it seem like he was trying, really hard to unnerve the main character, and make it look like he cares on what happen to Dahlia. It doesn't make any sense. I feel bad, for the kid (Ariel Gade). She's a really cute kid, but she's can't delivered the horrible one-dimensional dialogue, she was given. There are parts of the film, where she kinda shines, but for the most part, she felt like, an unrealistic girl scout, stereotype. There were some added material for some supporting roles which serves absolutely no purpose. A good example is the man the elevator (Simon Reynolds). He failed to advance the plot and he never brought back, up again. Honestly, for being a tenant in the building. You would think, he would give some more exposition, than proving information, we already knew. Tim Roth for instance has some scenes that are there only so he can get some more screen time. It's really hard to take his role as a good lawyer, serious, when he sounds like Jon Lovitz's Tommy Flanagan. The other supporting cast were pretty useless. Pete Postlethwaite as Veeck, should had been, portray more menacing, but they chose to make him, into a clumsy side-character. The only entertaining person in the film was John C. Reilly as Murray, the landlord. I like, how he makes the crappy apartment in Roosevelt Island seem better than it looks. The location does have a creepy environment. I have to give, props to the movie for that. The ghost, not so much. The ghost in the film, really doesn't show her presence, much and the movie has odd moments, where she does. Like how on earth, did was she able to haunt the school, as well? Honestly, how powerful was the ghost!? The movie really has vague answers for these questions. The movie doesn't have that many jump scares. In many ways, the movie drives the symbolism that it's always raining, a little too much. It kinda got annoying, at times. I really hate, how much water was wasted for this film. The movie has a lot of ominous music that tells you when a suspenseful moment is around the corner and creeping about in apartments over and over again. Yet, there is little suspense. The movie downplay the overt horror elements of the original and becoming more of a character study / dramatic psychological thriller with a focus on paranoia and atmosphere over scares. It kinda works, but it's also doesn't. The movie pacing moves really slowed, and not much, of the main plot, get done, during the time. The movie pacing really doesn't help push the plot, along. It just creates, more sub-plots, like Dahlia looking for work, a lawyer, and a good school. Honestly, the movie works more like a divorce drama, than a horror film. I hate how the movie is so sluggish and lazy. It reused shots, way too much. It felt cheap. The movie moves into more trouble water with the awful ending that really made the film, much worse than it could had been. I like the 2002 ending better. The movie is probably more, scary, today, then when it came out. In 2013, a woman name Elisa Lam was found death at the Cecil hotel in Los Angeles, when she drown in the hotel water tank. The circumstances of her death have been compared to plot elements in this film, such as the names of the characters, the dysfunctional elevator and discolored water gushing from the building's faucets. Overall: This character-driven film was sorely underdeveloped. I wish it was better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one if the best drama/horror movies in some time. Jennifer Connelly proves she is seriously a great actress. You really get involved with this film, I loved the cast and locations worked a charm. Tim Roth was great as usual but I think the young actress was superb too. This surprised me how low the rating was it shows how stupid the audience can be for not seeing the big picture with this movie.There were enough scares but it was more of a mind thinking film as opposed to cheap scares and gore.The tension was there the whole film and that was good to see. I think this deserves a lot more praise but the budget seems way to high for me could have been done for a lot less.Still a very good film I highly recommend to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has become one of my favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched this movie for quite a few times now. It's a beautiful piece of artistic movie making. It's not entirely without problems, but this is one of those movies where I'm ready to overlook a few shortcomings because there are so many other redeeming aspects.First, the visuals and atmosphere are amazing. Second, the acting and characters are really really good. Jennifer Connelly does a great role and creates a character that you actually care for. The supporting cast is also great, John C. Reilly, Pete Postlethwaite, Tim Roth.. all portray real characters. No one is bad or good, just people who seem real.I see this movie like an album of dark music, Portishead or so. It makes you feel something that is otherworldly, it takes you to another place, it picks beauty out of decay and rust, rain and darkness. Not for people who only like to think of roses and blue skies.The story of this movie is interesting to a point, but mostly the relationships and feelings of the people. The "horror" part, be it supernatural or not, may not succeed quite as well. In the end you may not completely understand what happens, but it doesn't really matter that much to me.To make another analogy with music and this movie, the story here is like lyrics in music. With certain music, the lyrics don't matter as much as the sounds. It doesn't always matter if the lyrics or the story aren't perfectly understandable, because the atmosphere is so well made.If you think of this movie as a horror movie, which it is marketed as, it's good to note that there are no gore and very few jump scares if any. That is always a major plus in my book, because it actually takes skill to craft a scary movie without them. This movie relies on atmosphere, characters and drama.It's a sad movie, but beautifully made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Atmospherics and Great Acting?Emotional and Engaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent, but Somewhat Familiar Psychological Thriller that is an Exercise in Emotional Breakdown in an Unfriendly World. Jennifer Connelly Leads a Great Cast of Character Actors with an Outstanding Performance from Aerial Dadane as the Daughter.This was Marketed as a Horror Film and Disappointed a Lot of Fans with its Slow Burn and Atmospherics. But it is Nonetheless and Engaging Film that Draws You In with its Creepy and Gloomy Cityscape and a Building that has a Disturbing Personality of its Own.The Movie is Made in the Roman Polanski Tradition for Adults. The Supernatural Elements are Included for Some Scares, but it is the Real Life Horrors that Truly Make this a Disturbing Drama About Mental Illness, Child Abuse, and Abandonment.Overall, Recommended for Mature Thinkers that Like Their Horror More Intellectual than Physical. The Great Cast is a Standout and Director Walter Salles has Crafted a Film that was Not Well Received by Critics and was Released for a Target Audience that Showed It Nothing but Disdain. It's Better than That and is Definitely Worth a Watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch for the scenery, not the story...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the story, eh, pretty basic, just another cliché about imaginary friends gone bad, a boring horror tale. However, the decrepit and industrial scenery was worth it. Through the film I was intrigued by the setting, the rotten old apartment, the red and white striped smokestacks at the power plant when the child gets onto the roof, the factories, the towers, the smog... the story was worth maybe a 3 out of 10, the scenery I'd give a 10 out of 10, so to even it out I rated Dark Waters with a 5. It was actually a remake of a Japanese version of the story. It seems to be in the same family as Orphan, the Ring, Hide &amp; Seek, Fragile and Mirrors. Not a great movie but worth it for the factories, I love pollution! If you ever want to make a movie, head out to this place to film it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a very creepy film in which Jennifer Connelly moves to New York City with young (very young) daughter in tow following a divorce. They move into a rundown apartment, and weird things start happening. The daughter starts seeing things and acting strangely. Oily black water starts appearing out of nowhere. Ghosts start appearing. The landlord and an agent know something and aren't talking. The daughter's teacher observes the daughter's behavior and offers to help. I think the best part of this film is the overall creepy (and I do mean CREEPY) atmosphere, and I also loved John C. Reilly's role as the agent. That was obviously meant to provide comic relief, and it worked. Check this one out if you get the chance-you will like it. :-) ** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually horrors are very silly, knives, blood and guts.If you enjoy that most out of a horror then you will probably hate this film. If you are a fan of classics like 'The Wickerman' or 'The Stone Tape' then you will enjoy this film.Instead of taking a 'thriller' approach to the horror genre the director has made the film into a supernatural drama. This means that as well as ghosts and mysterious noises, the protagonist has more domestic things on her mind. This can be her recent divorce or her past with her horrific mother. Drama is the key to this film's charm, building tension slowly through things that humans would find tense in real life.Of course if a Horror was just about domestic issues then it would'nt be a horror, there is also complaints of a suspicious noise and a patch of dampness on the ceiling which never hoes away.My only gripes was the slow build-up to the finale, but if you see the film as more of a drama than a horror then you won't feel like this.Watch the film, it is a strong, emotion driven drama with a supernatural twist and the ending will make you cry. I may watch the Japanese original or read the suzuki novel for comparison.PS. It's not just for adults to enjoy, Im a teenager and I found it rather intriguing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We all need Mothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dark Waters is a movie,that most girl - children raised by single mothers and single mothers alike will relate to,Jenniffer Connelly plays the role of A Mother who was neglected as a child by her mother,and this as a result has caused her to be the direct opposite of her mother,she plays the role with conviction that you forget that she is acting,you feel her struggles and pains,and the movie for the most part is not a horror flick its mostly suspense,as we try to understand whats happening to her Apartment,of course we later discover the true nature of the situation.The movie lacked identity,you were not sure whether you were watching a horror flick or a great suspense drama movie,and it was simply to slow to generate the emotions that it was suppose to generate as a movie of its Calibre.The movie also can't be classified as the best movie of its time for this particular genre,there was no real intention from the director i feel he could have done more,but i congratulate him for the casting of the little girl,the girl was brilliant and her screen chemistry with Connelly was worth noting.The bottom line i think, is that the movie was about the relationship between a mother and her daughter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a drama than a horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jennifer Connoley's character was a sympathetic one as she dealt with the real stresses and strains of starting a new life as a divorcée with a child in tow. Things such as finding work, an affordable place to live, bad building conditions, helping Cecilia adjust to a new life, are all very real scenarios and one can really feel the stress she was under in the movie. The sf/horror part of the picture seemed to play a secondary role to the drama portion. Throw in her own past abuse from her childhood along with Natasha's parents leaving her behind and the result is more of a sad, tragic flick rather than a horror.I really liked this movie but probably not for the reasons the director intended. It was marketed as a horror but played out as a sad drama. Sometimes, an occasional sad movie is a good thing because its different from the traditional, Hollywood formulas with the happy ending. It shows a willingness to take a chance and I respect the director for doing so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie had a confusing theme to begin with and the more you saw the more confused you were however it did have some jump out of your seat scares. The mystery though of the movie was given away in the beginning. It also had themes that were very similar to those of the ring almost identical such as the flashbacks, the mothers try to solve the problem and the death due to family issues in my opinion though this movie had everything horror, sci fi, comedy, drama, and a little romance and some scenes that made you wanna cry. However I thought this was a pretty funny movie yet it had its moments and an okay twist however the movie was a little to much extended as the ending was stretched. However I would recommend you see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good acting, bad execution of plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching the film I had a preconceived idea that the film would be more under the genre of 'horror', however the amount of scares were few and the story was told as more of a drama/mystery with thriller elements rather than gore and special effects. This is not a bad thing in my eyes, as I prefer the type of horrors that don't pointlessly include scares that add nothing to the story.There are a number of films out there that centre around a child who can see the dead or spend the majority of a film communicating with what we are informed as an imaginary friend. The major negative about this film for me was that this concept has been done and done again so many times before with a more intelligent plot behind it. For example, 'The Sixth Sense' being the first of its kind impressed critics and the public, resulting in future semi-successful films such as 'Hide and Seek' falling in it's shadows. A film like 'The Orphanage' is able to use that concept again but create an atmosphere and story that made it compete with previously existing films of its kind... Unfortunately this film didn't.Jennifer Connelly as the leading role carried the film for me, with impressive acting skills and a believable approach to her role. It's a pity that the film didn't include more character development. I didn't feel sorry for the child who was abandoned - If I did, the ending might have been more satisfactory.Overall I felt the film was mediocre. My time didn't feel wasted but I doubt this film will stay in my memory for long. I wouldn't recommend it to fans of horror. I have never seen the original but I hazard a guess that it was executed better, so perhaps avoid this remake and watch that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the storyline was amazing. But it wasn't portrayed so well. The actors were fine, I just think the story could have been written better. In general, this idea has so much potential to be either good or bad, and the actors did their best given the circumstances. This idea was genius, but it didn't really come together well. the actors are amazing actors, and the idea is amazing, but it didn't really flow. Although it may have had a few parts that make you kind of say "huh?" (which was really the goal), I feel like it didn't have enough of these. It wasn't as suspenseful as I expected it to be. This definitely isn't on my top ten, but it was a very interesting plot, and it isn't really dumbed down like a lot of movies in the modern era.</fullReview>

This could have easily been just another horror movie but director took a different path and decided rather to focus on mother daughter binding. Jennifer Connelly played her part to perfection. Overall my suggestion is don't expect anything and just enjoy whats being served.It might not be the best movie you have ever seen but will definitely not lie among the lasts. and again its actually non traditional and not a run of mill product .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy and with a depressing atmosphere, rather than scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dark water" is labeled as a horror movie, but I would rather call it a very atmospheric psychological drama, and a very depressing one at that, with very creepy undertones. It's not a "nice" movie to see, and the story can be rather disheartening. It follows a recently separated young mother, Dahlia (Connelly), who, in order to keep full custody of her little daughter, Cecilia, decides to move into a place of their own. We guess she isn't exactly well off, so her best choice is an old, not very well maintained but very affordable apartment in a huge block on New York's Roosevelt Island. As Dahlia's life keeps falling apart, so does her new place, due to the constant leakage coming down from the apartment right upstairs. From then on, several supernatural and creepy elements intertwine with the very real life drama of a single mom who can barely afford her new home and who has to fight back a not very nice ex husband, whilst having to stand up against her own metaphorical demons from her past. All of this, plus the gloomy atmosphere -it keeps raining during most of the movie- and other plot elements that the viewer will find out, make for a movie that is, at times, not easy to watch and that will stay with you for a while when it's over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There was a "Ring" all around this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was really a tale of self sacrifice. Just what would you do to save the life of your child? Ultimately, Dahlia (Jennifer Connely) gave her life to save the life of her child.This movie was very similar to "The Ring" in that there was a little girl's spirit running around, she was drowned, she lead a woman to find her body, and there was a lot of water. I guess the Japanese are not immune to copycatting what works like Americans do. One thing is for sure: evil little Samara type dead girls are en vogue. I think "The Exorcist" was the first movie to explore using a girl as a symbol of evil, and lately it has come back to life. I was shocked by the absence of rampant killing and death in this movie. I think that was the movie's best weapon. The movie kept me on edge as I was prepared for someone to get killed with every dark musical chord. It is like when my mother told me I was going to get a spanking for something but she didn't do it right away, so I would be an utter wreck while fearfully waiting for the inevitable. This movie did not allow me to rest due to the constant threat of death lingering throughout the movie. But, I think the movie ended in a somewhat anti-climatic manner with Dahlia sacrificing herself, or maybe it was just my desire to see the good ole American happy ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dark Water" is a first rate psychological thriller, a remake of a fifth rate Japanese horror film of the same title. Coherent, beautifully acted, photographed and produced, "Dark Water" just misses being a thematic masterpiece. Unfortunately, the producers and director pulls their punches in the horrific element. Sadly, this softening even detracts from the realism of the climax.WARNING: SPOILER The only good thing about the Japanese "Dark Water" was the genuine revulsion generated as the decaying corpse of the young girl embraces the mother in the elevator before taking her to her death. In the American version,Jenifer Connelly finds the young girl's body in pristine condition, even though the young girl drown many month's back.END OF SPOILER Had some realistic gore elements been retained, "Dark Water" would have succeeded both as a psychological suspenser and horror film. However, as it stands, "Dark Water" is only as good as a middling "Ghost Whisperer" episode, minus the cleavage (another place the producers and director missed the boat, given Ms. Connelly's spectacular figure)."Dark Water" should have been a "10". I give it an "8".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My VERY first post on a film watched last night so be gentle. Thankfully, I have not seen the original version, which I will do after seeing this film last night. With that in mind, I watched Dark Water with an open mind and have to say was not disappointed.It shouldn't be viewed as a horror story, instead should be viewed as a drama with a slight twist of horror included. Sure some questions will be raised, such as how anyone can be brave enough to go into someone else's apartment, but with that aside, the actors and actresses do a decent job of holding the film together. Connely was at her fragile best. Ariel Gade played her character without the usual overacting child actors/actresses tend to do nowadays to get noticed. Reilly, Roth and Scott also were commendable.Somehow this film reminded me of The Village, which if you neglect all the trailers and critic's comments becomes a beautiful story of innocence instead of the hype that it is a horror story in the Shayamalam (sp?) tradition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another unfortunate remake that relies too much on it's visuals and on the "shocking" factor."Dark Water" at least has an excellent lead cast. You can't go wrong in any movie (even Horror) when the marvelous Jennifer Connelly is the lead actress. She is very intense and believable in all of her scenes. She's a delight to watch not only because she's extremely beautiful, but because she has a lot to say with her eyes... Yes, even on the situations of this movie. John C. Reilly also delivers a strong, believable performance. The problem with the movie is that it gets predictable and boring at some points. The CGI effects aren't that impressive and do not add anything to the movie.On the other side, "Dark Water" looks like a dramatic effort with Horror tones. Sadly, it's PG-13 rating rests credibility to it.My recommendation is to avoid this movie. Or, if you are a fan of Jennifer Conelly's work, try your best and watch "Dark Water".</fullReview>

Why is it that American audiences have to have these films re-made for them, is it because they don't like reading sub-titles or because they don't feel able to empathise with characters who aren't American? Without wishing to sound anti-American (which I am not) doesn't an unwillingness to ingest non American cinema lead to an insularity...which can't be healthy either culturally or politically. Having said that this a reasonable re-make...but why bother when the original is so good. Remaking classic films, whether two years after the event or sixty usually results in an inferior product. So often now films are remade either because the originals were foreign with subtitles or because the originals have presumably dated visually (e.g Superman...or Dawn of the Dead)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about Dahlia and her daughter Ceci looking for a place to stay in New York. Dahlia is divorced to her husband who tries to take Ceci from her. Dahlia and Ceci finds a run-down apartment building to stay. Later does Dahila finds out, a spirit is haunting their stay.This is, as you can see, an underrated movie. Maybe people think this movie is boring, but I think not. This is an entertaining and a psychological movie. There is a lot of drama in this movie when Connelly's character notices a leak on the top of their apartment room. Day after day it gets bigger and she decides to call the manger. He gets a person, fixes it but it still comes back.Dahila hears water running upstairs but the manager said that no one lived there for some time. Then, Dahila feels that something is wrong in the apartment and she's right. This is the same author who did The Ring. It is also a remake of the Japanese film made by Hideo Nakata, whose work also inspired Ring pictures.The movie opens with a controversial fight between Dahila nd her husband and needs to find a new home for herself and her daughter Ceci. The hallways, in the apartment, is dark and dank, the elevators is rundown and kinda broken, and more damages all over this place. The acting is GREAT from Connelly. You know that I say this in every review but this time I actually mean it (just kidding). Her performance makes it convincing that she loves her daughter.This movie is dark and dull on the way it is filmed. This film is not boring but entertaining. this is a mystery thriller that you'll certainly like. This is certainly an underrated film.</fullReview>

This film is not gory, it doesn't have that stupid jerky camera technique that is ruining modern horror, there are no real knee-jerk scares of the bogeyman sort. Instead this really Gothic styled movie slowly introduces very real characters who behave like real people (i.e. the kid was not just a prop and also wasn't precocious/super-smart, the skeezy landlord who seems a lot like mine), makes you care about them and then gradually pours on the creepy.

Camryn Manheim, Tim Roth, John C. Reilly and Ariel Gade all do spot-on work; and Pete Postlethwaite is perfect for his part. I do agree (with many others) that Jennifer looks like she should regain a few pounds... screw Hollywood and its all-women-must-be-stick-figures mentality.Ultimately I gave this movie a 6/10, which means I thought it was better than average but not worth owning; and I'll probably never see it again.

		<fullReview>SPIOLERS!!!! IT WOULDN'T LET ME CLICK THE SPOILER BUTTON!!!! This movie is completely fake. It was billed as a horror/thriller, but in fact isn't either. It's really a sappy drama, portrayed as being about a loving mom, her daughter, and a seemingly bastard husband, until you realize it's actually about a frustrated husband, a daughter, and a crazy wife. All of the suspense has nothing to do with the main plot. In other words they invented the suspenseful plot to try and make a story out of this movie, when in fact nothing is going on. It feels like your watching 10 minutes out of the life of adrian from Rocky, only she doesn't marry rocky and instead goes insane while raising your 10 year old daughter. There's just nothing here, don't watch it. It lies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The journey through murky memories and a scumhole apartment block, is oozing with atmosphere. Good acting too, except for P. Postlethwaite, who hams disgracefully.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite her misgivings about renting a scummy old apartment, recently divorced Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly), moves in, because her young daughter, Ceci (Ariel Gade ? excellent) is very taken with the dump. In fact, Ceci has been possessed by a spooky spirit, which lives there. Gradually mother and daughter are drawn into a murky world where past, present and supernatural intertwine. Ultimately the intertwining is slightly disappointing for this viewer, but the journey is worthwhile. Director Walter Salles who's already made a strong impression with Central Station and The Motorcycle Diaries, is expert in his handling of mood and psychological mystery. Not so much a thriller or a shocker, more a gradual immersion in foreboding, unease and filthy water. Most of the supporting cast is excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>for those who did not see the original it might be a true experience. I's psychological, downbeat, darky and very serious, maybe too serious. There are glimpses of humour with the addition of Veek caretaker (Postlethwaite-reminding of Poalnski's Tenant)and John C. Reilly's real estate Murray (Rosemary's baby). It's like Salles and Iglesias took a peak at Polanski's films (including Repulsion), I wondered what kind of film Lucky Mc Gee (May) would have done of it. Unlike the first Ring remake they took this one seriously but forgot about the basic scares. It's as scary as strong a decaf coffee is compared to an Expresso. Also the Japanese have a specific thing about the water. The Americans don't, so they over float it with music and sound effects. And add some Shining to the mix. And the dysfunctional divorce. And the red jacket from Don't Look Now. Though I'm glad they did not change the ending. And being shot in Canada, wow, on set, good colors and set design, too noisy though. If you saw the original first, this one it's more of a drama with an addition of a bummer of scares and surprises (The Grudge translates better as you relocate an American in Tokyo) but it's still fun to see Tim Roth alone in the theater (a Sunday with the family at the movies ?!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Severely watered down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DARK WATER concerns a young woman named Dahlia Williams (Jennifer Connelly) who is going through a messy custody battle with her husband over their daughter, Cecelia. With little money on hand, they move into the creepiest apartment building they can afford on Roosevelt Island in New York. It is a dank, depressing place, but they don't have much choice. At least the school nearby is highly regarded.Before long, they begin to experience plumbing problems, presumably from the apartment above them. Evil-looking stains appear on the ceiling and grow. Dahlia can't make any headway with the evasive landlord or maintenance man. Then there's the mysterious whispering, and her daughter has seemingly made an imaginary friend - who tells her things about her mother that she couldn't possibly know.DARK WATER, like THE RING, is a remake of a Japanese film by Hideo Nakata and based on a story by Koji Suzuki. Unlike THE RING or THE GRUDGE, the other big horror import of the last few years, this version fails to improve on or even equal the quality or effectiveness of the original film. The story hasn't changed, but all the frightening or even creepy moments I remember from Nakata's film are absent. There is no build-up or tension. This film is - sorry - severely watered down.Moreover, audiences unaware that this is a remake of a film from 2002 are likely to find it too similar to THE RING TWO (which was also directed by Nakata, but which was not a remake of the Japanese RING 2) and think it derivative, when in fact it's the other way around.If I hadn't seen the Japanese original, I'd probably have a much higher opinion of this one. The performances are great. It's an okay movie, as it stands, but much was lost in the translation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The director gets to render a sense of abandonment and anguish and retain it for the all runtime. It's not so scary but achieves the aim of suggesting and giving the story an emotional core. Cast is stellar (also the unrecognizable Tim Roth) but in spite of the solid action and direction the film doesn't manage to give genuine scares; nobody questions the high quality of the product but the rate, as far as I can see, cannot rise above the average for the only reason that the sense of isolation and the dark atmosphere is not enough creepy. Strange role the one of Pete Postlethwaite, an actor any competent movie goer will remember for his performance in "In the name of the father".</fullReview>

I rank it at least as highly as The Grudge! Connelly was awesome in portraying a very disturbed but loving Mother and her Daughter was very believable. Good job by the little actress!! I was terrified by the constant tension and pulling at my emotions, never knowing what to expect next!! The other parts played by various actors and their unknown involvement in the plot never allowed me to predict the ending. Sure, water tank section was predictable as this type of plot was similar to other film by the Author, but I did not find that distracting. Depressing it was,but well done!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what to say about this film...I liked it very much...but yet am confused by it. I think thats why I liked it so much. It definitely does not have a specific genre type to it(Drama, Suspense) I suppose would fit it. Anyways about the actual film...I loved it. It was oddly watchable and very claustorphohic if you ask me. The ghost story serves as a back story to the overall story which is kinda cool if you ask me. Actually I found the scenes in which Dahlia has her migraines and flashes of her mother to be the most terrifying because the thought of someone hating their own child that much is terrible to view. Its a film about fighting inner demons from the past that evolve into oddly similar happenings in the present...if that makes any sense. Jennifer Connelly is magnificent as usual and steals all the scenes which is the whole movie! She is the only actress that always makes me tear up when she's on screen. She is a very powerful actress and a wonderful crier...so many scenes in this I was blown away by how damn good she was. And the relationship with her daughter was very well done and not corny at all. I found their scenes the best because they were so well acted, especially where Dahlia fixes Ceci's hair before her first day of school....very touching. Kudos to Ariel Gade who if I may add kicks Dakota's ass in a heartbeat. Anyways I cannot describe this film to much because its very "off"...but in a good way. If you want a heart pounding scarefest this IS NOT for you at all. If you want a claustorphobic film that shows the bleakness of THE REALITY OF HOW CRAPPY LIFE IS with a subtle ghost story intertwined into it...well this may very well pull the right strings. 8 out of 10 for strong acting, touching maternal moments, and the pitch perfect feel of a depressed person in a shitty situation.</fullReview>

Another part that scared me was when she went to the water tower and the dead girls body was in there and then the dead girl opens her eyes. Just a reminder: not for kids. This is one of the best supernatural chillers I have seen since "The Exorcist." Loved it. I will get it for DVD. Just please people don't show it to your little ones. It's not a good movie for them.

		<fullReview>The main problem with Salles' 'Dark Water' is that he appears not to have been interested in making a horror film - instead he seems to be aiming for a psychological thriller like Polanski's 'Repulsion'. The result is a damp squib of a film that never ignites and often moves so slowly as to verge on the boring. Certainly the film looks good with its muted colours and occasional flash of 'Don't Look Now' type red but that doesn't compensate for the feeling that everybody concerned lost interest in the film they were making. Connolly is good as the woman going through a divorce and having flashbacks to her childhood with her emotionally abusive mother but only once does the film give her the space to stretch her talents to really convince the viewer that this is a woman being driven to the verge. The film plods along and I found myself mentally comparing it to the superior Japanese version. Not worth bothering with</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT a horror movie, more suspense thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dahlia Williams is going through a bitter divorce and custody battle. She and her daughter Ceci has just moved to a new apartment and she has also gotten a new job. Problem is that the new apartment building she moved into hides a rather dark secret. One that her daughter is quick to get involved in with her "new" imaginary friend. The pace of the movie is really slow and everyone that has seen some of the other Japanese horror movies that has surfaced lately will see the obvious plot within 5 min of the movie. It's not a horror movie in any regards rather a suspense thriller. The cast is stellar and do their best with the script, but I would have to say I would like to see Jennifer Connelly in some more upbeat roles than she has been in. Her character is reminiscent of the female in "House of sand and fog", "Requiem for a dream". Nothing goes her way and no matter what she does it is in vain. The ending helped bring the movie up abit, but it still suffers from the slow pace. It's a generally good story but if you want to see Japanese horror check out The Ring or The Grudge. This one is more for an older audience that like atmosphere and a decent story rather than a fright thrill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you expect some teenage horror flick with ghost, blood and violence you'll let this one go. I have read numerous reviews of this movie in which the critic seems to have wanted horror and gore - and when this didn't occur bashed the movie. The "monster" in this movie is not a creature from outer space or a supernatural ghost seeking to get rest through harassing the innocent and unknowing main characters. Still "Dark Water" is indeed a chilling story. The drama of a mother fighting her inner ghosts in order to succeed as a single parent.So plot wise I understand why so many dislike this movie. I haven't seen the original movie but saw the "Rings" (which I liked) and these movies aren't in the same genre! "Dark Water" is much more "scary" than a certain videotape or the sound and sight of "dead people".....go watch "Dark Water" if you are up for it!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Japanese make great movies - The Ring, The Grudge, Battle Royale (which I haven't seen re-made yet). Hollywood takes the movies and remakes them because, gosh darn it, those subtitles are just so annoying. Dark Water is another remake. It was a bit slow starting but I will forgive it. Right from the start you know what is causing the "dark water" but it doesn't stop it being an interesting film. Of course there is the mandatory small child who contributes to the scary moments. The movie is set in a foul, gigantic apartment block, the kind you just know would reek of wees in all the stairways and lifts. Like I said it was rather slow, and why her lawyer appears so creepy and then isn't I don't know. I sat there waiting for him to do something foul. There was a bit of a Sound of Music moment - where you think the movie is over and then it keeps on going - which was good because if it had ended where I thought it would it would have been crappy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mother and child are haunted by a child ghost which leaves watery trails AGAIN!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought "Dark Water" was supposed to be about water - enough of it to tickle any latent aqua-phobia in all of us. It rains and it rains and it rains ... and the ceiling leaks but the dark water never elevates beyond a mere nuisance.However, the main theme of the movie is of a mother and her child. Inaruably it's one of the strongest human bonds and its violation so emotionally depicted is a gutting experience for the viewer. However, apart from reprobating mothers who abandon their children, it hardly packs any punch. It just falls into the same bin as the Ring 2 and crashes into a maudlin heap of motherly love adorned with first effusive concern and then into aggrandized finale of absolute sacrifice.We get the feeling that the movie is only trying to build up atmosphere; haunting soundtrack, possessed electro-mechanical devices and just reactions. It's not trying to tell a story; just painting a picture that you feel as a whole. Each character in the movie are extrapolations of an adjective; the slimy apartment salesman; the dissembling apartment manager and so on. Even the ghosts powers are so undefined and given no bound that reactions are not to make a stand against it but to react.However, on the whole this just feels like a condensed form of "the Ring" - except more tempered and more atmospherical. The beautiful Jennifer Conneley plays her second domicile related movie and captures and illuminates the screen so perfectly evoking in part that vulnerable woman in distress as she did in "the house of fog and sand".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Dark Water</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've haven't been much of a fan of the recent wave of popular Asian horror films, and haven't really paid much attention to the Hollywood remakes either. That is until Jennifer Connelly compelled me to take a dip into Dark Water.Connelly stars as Dahlia, who's in a custody battle with her estranged husband (Dougray Scott) for their daughter Cecilia (Ariel Gade). Mother and daughter settle for a new run-down apartment, and experience strange leaks from the unit above. However, nobody occupies that unit, and soon Dahlia is drawn into the mysterious disappearance of its occupants.At times, this movie plays like the recent Robert DeNiro-Dakota Fanning movie Hide and Seek, with little subplots like imaginary friends, and the parent having some psychological problems. However, these subplots are never fully explored, leading to an ending which somehow leaves you with this empty feeling that more could and should have been touched on. Obviously, there are red-herrings thrown in, but there is absolutely no scary moment in which you'll jump right off your seat.This film though, is all about Mother's Love, and the longing for it. Many scenes in the movie make you go awww, drawing into your own experience of your mummy's concern for your welfare. The things that a mother would do to protect her child and keep her safe from harm, are always admirable.There are notable actors in this movie - John C Reilly, Tim Roth, Dougray Scott, Pete Postlethwaite, but they are relatively under-utilized, which is a pity. There is also a lack of a strong soundtrack to punctuate the right atmosphere in a horror movie.Since I haven't watched the original, I couldn't compare it for you. However, as a horror film, Dark Water didn't cut it, as it seemed more like a thriller/whodunnit/mystery with some mild supernatural elements thrown in. Perhaps it's just me, but perhaps Hollywood still doesn't have a knack in transplanting or capturing horrific elements from the original.</fullReview>

Struggling emotionally, haunted by her mother and her troubled youth, financially crippled, and hassled by her cheating ex-husband, Dahlia is a desperate soul looking for any avenue to survive in the city of New York. Dahlia moves onto Roosevelt Island, which is presented like a prison, and soon becomes trapped by the ghosts that haunt her apartment complex. She struggles with custody of her only child and the disobedience of Ceci. Her ex-husband continues to badger her and try to retain custody of Ceci. Besides an amazing performance by Jennifer (my favorite) and haunting visuals, the movie isn't as scary as other J-Flicks, The Ring, The Grudge. Wait for the video.</fullReview>

I fault the distributors for the way the trailers are edited to give the impression that this is a gooey horror flick, when really it's all character and atmosphere. This story had a lot more going for it than the trailers let on, but those who went to be scared will be disappointed. Once again, the marketing dept interferes to the detriment of a nice little story about people coping with stress and tragedy, with a supernatural element. Good performances by Jennifer Connelly, John Reilly, and Pete Postlethwaite (disturbingly menacing). Tim Roth's character is very interesting, but goes nowhere, story-wise. It would have been nice to some development between his and Connelly's characters. The ending pretty much precludes that, but a little more would have made the final result that much more poignant.Worth seeing, but not to be scared.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dark Water isn't necessarily a horror film involving supernatural events. It could simply be the tale of a crazy woman whose mother was crazy, and whose daughter is also crazy. Think about that while you're watching it.A ghost doesn't kill Dahlia in the end, she commits suicide. Same as her mother did. And her daughter is still talking to an "imaginary friend." They're nuts, no ghosts involved.Another good "parallel theme" film is Paul Verhoeven's "Total Recall." You never know if Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is experiencing his virtual spy vacation or really saving Mars from destruction. I found "Dark Water" to be much less subtle about the parallel themes. References to Dahlia's state of mental health are made almost constantly throughout the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I need a Japanese horror tutor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With "Dark Water," I'm convinced that there exists a fundamental difference between Japan and the US as to what constitutes a narrative. True, this is an American remake of the Japanese hit. It furthermore seems a bit of a tenuous position to decry foreign conceptions of horror as a native of a country responsible for nearly a dozen flicks about a homicidal hockey goalie. But, along with the two "Ring" movies and "The Grudge," "Dark Water" seems to be a deliberate test of how much silliness we'll tolerate in a film. Based on the overall box office of these movies so far, the current answer seems to be somewhere in the neighborhood of "quite a lot." The outlines of "Dark Water" will be familiar to anyone who's seen any of the previous American renditions of Japanese boo flicks. There's an ornery kiddie ghoul, a daughter with a worrisome "imaginary" friend, and plenty of frightening moisture. Perhaps the notable absence of any conditions or rules within which these elements operate is the very thing that audiences interpret as scares. To me, though, the water of a washing machine turning black, for example, is not inherently chilling. Odd, perhaps. An annoying inconvenience, certainly. But lacking any cues to the contrary, I'm unlikely to spend much time worrying that it could in fact be an indication of an unruly underage aqua-phantom lurking in the apartment above me; a demon that can not only follow my daughter to school, but can wreak havoc with property values as well by unleashing otherworldly wet spots on my unsuspecting ceiling.A movie with no central conceit puts nothing at stake for us. The events of "Dark Water" have no impact; they occur because they can, not because they must. Indeed, for someone who spends most of the film annoyed by what she assumes are plumbing problems, and dealing with her daughter's rocky adaptation to her new school, Jennifer Connelly is surprisingly ready to make an abrupt leap into the supernatural by the film's climax. "Dark Water" is like a feature-length trailer; full of enticing and creepy imagery that you hope will be fleshed out in the film. The Japanese horror invasion shows no signs of slowing, and I'm still waiting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I found it generally engaging I can't really recommend Brazilian filmmaker Walter Salles "Dark Water" for a wide audience. Imagine a cross between Polanski's "The Apartment" and "Sixth Sense"; although not nearly as good. Still if you liked those films this is worth viewing. It is just as claustrophobic as "Apartment" and as washed out color-wise as "Sixth Sense", but it lacks the suspense buildup of either.The pacing is about the same as Polanski's slower stuff, but his slow pacing is designed to allow the viewer to read all the things he sprinkles throughout the film. Salles's film lacks most of these little sidelights although the malfunctioning washing machines (washer sounds are normally comforting because they remind us of our mother's heartbeat) and the Hello Kitty backpack are certainly Polanski worthy.Salles does a great job directing with the children, Connelly is wonderful as usual, and except for poor audio the production itself is first class. You won't get all that creeped out by the many drips, leaks, and gushers but there is one very startling scene where Connelly discovers that she is reading a story to the wrong daughter. This scene is even more scary if you have already figured out that this daughter is Connelly herself at age six. Salles did not do a very good job making this connection; Perla Haney-Jardine plays both little girls but it is not all that obvious. Once you have it the other pieces fall into place and the film makes sense. Unfortunately that may not happen until you have left the theater.Salles should have gone out on the door closing behind Ariel Gade as she leaves the building with her hair braided. The short montage afterward takes away from the final scene in the elevator.</fullReview>

It has great performances by Jennifer Conelly, John C. Riley and Tim Roth and their characters all have some excellent material to work with. Although the film isn't really SCARY per say, it does have a very spooky atmosphere complimented by great production design, cinematography and a nice steady directing style. Unfortunately it's another title on the growing list of American remakes of Japanese horror films and although the formula might work in terms of box office numbers, it likely won't ever produce a great American horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Almost every advertisement campaign for upcoming horror films these days seem to carry one common tag line; From The Creators Of "The Ring". As though this simple fact will be a convincing enough strategy to lure audiences to the theater.Nevertheless, this particular marketing ploy obviously remains successful to some extent when you consider the current influx of Americanized adaptations of Japanese horror productions.But here, what gives "Dark Water" a distinction above its predecessors, is its leisurely-paced, subtle approach and psychological elements over the standard visual and audible jolts. It's a more adult-oriented excursion into the horror realm which doesn't rely on excessive gore, rock music, or a cast of pin-up, teenage idols to get its message across. In the aftermath of a bitter custody battle, Dahlia and her young daughter Cecilia, set out to begin their lives anew by relocating in a sinister Manhattan apartment. The building leaves much to be desired, but because of its convenience and affordability, Dahlia agrees to settle on it.No sooner have mother and daughter moved in that unusual occurrences begin, most notably, a leaky ceiling, a rather suspect state, considering the overhead apartment is apparently vacant. There is also the discovery of a school backpack on the building's roof, and Cecilia's sudden communications with an "imaginary friend".From there, we are left wondering if these are the indications of unnatural presences, or if more simple human influences are at the source of all the unexplainable manifestations.There are a lot of red herrings scattered throughout which serve to alert the viewer to ponder each development, as a lot of elements come into play which might better explain the mysterious happenings.Could it have anything to do with the friendly, yet over-eager real estate representative who seemed rather determined in convincing Dahlia to take the apartment? The odd and grumpy superintendent who monitors the building's occupants very closely, and always seems reluctant to oversee any repairs? The gang of teen vandals? Perhaps it is due to Dahlia's emotional strain which originates from her own repressed memories of childhood abandonment, or maybe it's because of a child's overactive imagination in its attempt to deal with the stress of family issues.These films always seem to present the supernatural perpetrators in the form of children with pasty complexions and dark, stringy hair, who are most likely the victims of neglect or abuse, and whose only purpose is to find someone human to love them.The atmosphere is foreboding and gloomy throughout, with its ceaseless overcast and rainy conditions, thus using the theme of water as one of the many symbolic elements that are so often featured prominently in these types of movies as a primary plot device and as a form of audience manipulation, which we've previously seen in the guise of a videotape, a well, etc. The apartment complex also takes on a life of its own, almost serving as a character in itself with its labyrinth of rooms, corridors and oppressive elevator, once again using daily appliances and utilities, and turning them into threatening entities.Overall, the ensemble of established and critically-acclaimed actors all turn in a solid performance. And little Ariel Gade, a newcomer to the child star canvas, is also quite effective in her portrayal of a potentially-endangered youngster."Dark Water" is a movie which offers up rich character development, elaborate attention to detail, and a classic ambiance which all serve up to present a superior alternative to the more modern fright material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, strong acting, but misses the subtlety of the Japanese original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen differing reviews of this movie, some which say it's okay and others which really go to town on it. I think the latter is very unfair and shows that there's still a gulf that exists between the style of Asian horror and Hollywood. A gulf that I can't really see will be resolved by continuing on the remake road. Having seen the original movie I liked it a lot and was very spooked by the end of it, so I was keen to see for myself if this movie had managed to travel well from the to the Hollywood style.I can tell you straight away that I didn't like it as much as the Asian original. The original Dark Water follows many of the same rules of Asian horror:Make the audience think for themselves Do not feed them the information or clues merely hint at them in the subtlest of ways Employ camera techniques to unnerve the audience It's interesting that for the beginning of the movie it does have a fair go at taking a gentle pace and building the tension slowly. For a traditional Hollywood audience this could be seen as dull, and it could even be taken that nothing seems to happen for the first half of the movie. This is where I think many reviewers and critics have hit the hurdle. This audience isn't ready for the Asian cinema, they still need a degree of spoon feeding, of scenes shown in blatant detail, clues spelled out in bold letters and big arrows pointing at the action centred firmly in the middle of the screen.Still all this said, I think the start of the movie does seem slow. It follows the style of the Asian original as much as it can, resorting to a few big in your face moments just in case the audience miss what happens, and then builds to much bigger set pieces in the latter half. These scenes are where the movie flips back to Hollywood from it's interpretation of the original, and that's where the slow paced suspense is lost and the slow pace of the first half seems slightly out of pace and almost too slow. If they had kept this feeling throughout I think it might have been a better movie.However, the tension is built well, and even the bigger, latter section of the movie is good. It still manages to keep the audience unsure and slightly uneasy. Yet the ending just doesn't seem as effective as the original, and again I think this is down to the bigger scenes crowding out what should be the biggest moment of the movie.The acting is strong in the movie, the young girl Ariel Gade provides a good performance and Jennifer Connelly is superb. Her performance as the confused and troubled mother desperately trying to hold her life together for her daughter is extremely convincing, particularly when she begins to fall apart. Dougray Scott provides a brief and memorable appearance, with Tim Roth backing up the cast. John C. Reilly is surprisingly good as the inept and self invested owner of the apartment block.Something that struck me about the main character is that she is portrayed as being mentally ill from the outset, this is something the original didn't have to do and it made me wonder why not. I came up with two options, either they were trying to make the audience believe that perhaps all this was in her mind despite the fact that her daughter was backing up her story, or that it made the events and decisions she makes more palatable to the Western audience. She has to be slightly unhinged for these things to happen, it couldn't happen to someone sane, they would either walk away or the movie would never reach it's climax. Again, I think this is down to the Hollywood audiences finding it much harder to accept the Asian plots. It's an aside though, as this aspect works well and builds the character to the final moments of the movie...but it did seem to steal the effect of the climax that the original had.Visually the movie looks great, and borrows a lot from the original. It's dark and foreboding, with the location and sets looking lifeless and ancient, as though they could be very unsafe and steeped with history. Without a doubt they've chosen an amazing location for the movie in the apartment blocks on Roosevelt Island.Generally the movie was good, I think it will definitely rise in your estimation if you haven't seen the original, but it will also highlight the change of pace between the two halves and make you feel the slowness of the opening more. This movie is far less subtle than it's original, and this really does make me mark it down. It's not just this movie either, it's something Hollywood does with all remakes of far subtler movies, and it's something they should learn to control. Still I'm not going to destroy it because of it's differences to the Asian original,. On it's own I think it stands as a good movie, and an effective chiller, it just doesn't do it well enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dark Waters" was disappointing to say the least. Ten minutes into the movie I figured out where Natasha was and what was going to happen. The only "scary" thing about this movie was the horrible apartment complex the protagonists moved into, not because it was spooky, but because it was dark, depressing, ugly, dirty, and dismal. Hollywood can't seem to make a good scary movie any more. And the ending line was comical and several of us in the theatre actually laughed at the ludicrous statement made by Jennifer Connelly's character (I won't spoil it for people who haven't seen the movie yet by explaining the last scene).Speaking of Hollywood, what is it with the cookie-cutter movies? It's always the same: ghost of a child talks/threatens the living child/family in the story and the adults walk around not knowing what is going on until the end when the body or the truth is found out. At the top of my head, I can think of 9 movies with this premise that have come out in the last few years: Sixth Sense (best one), The Ring 1 (very good), The Ring 2 (worst movie of the year), Stir of Echoes, The Grudge, Godsend, Hide and Seek, Darkness, and now Dark Waters.Isn't there any originality in Hollywood any more?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drowns Itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to begin by saying that people who say that this is not like the Ring are not completely wrong, but they are not completely right either. This movie has PLENTY in common with the Ring--the water, the ghostly girl, and some other factors that might be considered as spoilers on here. But the thing is that we accept most of the things that happen in the Ring. That is not the same here. Most of the events that go on in this movie are pointless. I went over the story a few times and tried to tie in certain things that stood out a lot. It drags for a long time and I know why, but these writers could have told the story much more quickly and it still would have made sense. "Made sense"--I use that term loosely because almost nothing here makes sense, especially when this ends. The ghostly girl--the imaginary friend of the mother's daughter--is what messes this up for me. The story is about a troubled woman: so much trauma has occurred throughout her life and she is facing a very difficult situation when the film starts, and it is almost like the dark water is closing in on her. Stop it right there. That calls for a psychological thriller, which is what this REMOTELY is. The movie could have done away with a lot of things and been pretty fair. But we will get away from there and go to the good characteristics. The atmosphere and music are good, reinforcing the dark and dank visuals. The images and the symbolism are both well-done. And the acting, especially by Connelly, is solid and decent. It is too bad that these good characteristics could not be incorporated into a better film. This just drowns itself in its own darkness of confusion and pointlessness. And as for the scare factor: it is not scary at all. Most people would probably find it disturbing, but not scary. If you enjoyed the Ring and/or the Ring 2 (which was as disappointing as this), then you will like this and see the clarity through the water =) 4.8/10 Stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If "The Ring 2" was "The Ring"-lite, this is "The Ring 2"-lite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every horror film released now brings comparisons and contrasts with "The Ring," sensibly so since that film was the best horror film to appear in some time and it achieved remarkable success both with critics and with the public. "Dark Water" was able to capitalize on an actual relationship with the ring--the novel was written by the author of the novel on which "Ringu" was based and the Japanese film was directed by the same man who directed "Ringu," Hideo Nakata. However, odd as it feels to say something like this about the man who directed "Mouse Trap," Gore Verbinski is still a league or two above Walter Salles and with the release now of "The Ring 2," the story seems not just trite but copied. Alas, "Dark Water" disappoints despite its relationship to "The Ring," but in its disappointment it's still a step up from the type of slasher and zombie movies we've gotten used to.The story, as I said, is rather tired and clichéd and seems to be largely repetitive of "The Ring 2." Meanwhile, the characters are also what we've grown to expect from horror films--the family is of course broken (Is there some sort of law that says that all films must now have broken families?) because of the father's perceived infidelities and he seems a decent enough person when we see him but we hear a lot from the mother telling us that he's not. As has become the norm following M. Night Shyamalan's lead, there are very few characters, and yet in this case they're not very well developed and a little heavy-handedly explained in Freudian terms. Rafael Yglesias has never been a huge fan of plot it seems (judging from the nearly plot less "Fearless" and only slightly plotted "From Hell"), but he usually has a flair for character, which didn't appear in this script.The acting in this film may be the thing that really sets it apart from others. Jennifer Connelly, who has recently become one of the most critically respected actors around, performs excellently in the lead role, managing to provide a believability to a role that could very easily go over the top and portray a wide array of feelings and emotions powerfully. Meanwhile, John C. Reilly (who, along with Chris Cooper, seems to be a master of performing well in great films without anyone noticing) pulls off his rather simple role very well and Pete Postlethwaite, sporting yet another new accent, manages to be vaguely creepy and yet believable as the grumpy building manager--though his character never does quite seem adequately explained. Ariel Gade and Dougray Scott are less successful, especially in one of Scott's final scenes, but neither is terrible.Walter Salles's direction does deserve some notice. He emphasizes the dank, dingy look of the apartment buildings both inside and out, keeping the film's atmosphere as murky as its title. The murky atmosphere is created so well that it carries the film for a while as we await what it is that's so creepy about what's happening--but then it never really happens. Salles also does deserve some credit for not repeating the green color of "The Ring" that many have since copied, but the truth is that his look is almost a throwback to older whodunnits, surrounding us with rain, thunder, lightning, and darkness. The dank, murky atmosphere does work, but the script isn't worthy of it and never lets it quite pay off, so Salles does deserve credit rather than blame for the film, though he didn't do anything too impressive.The music in this film also deserves note. Salles steals away David Lynch's composer Angelo Badalamenti and he, as usual, provides us with wonderful music that ratchets up the film's tension to a new level. He always creates a sound that is somehow both familiar and unusual, most prominently displayed in his work on "Twin Peaks," and that makes his scoring work perfect for thrillers, especially those of a supernatural type, and he definitely doesn't disappoint here. As the film loses steam throughout, Badalamenti's score becomes increasingly the main purpose for remaining in the theater.All told, "Dark Water" is a disappointing but still watchable film. It's more of a drama than a thriller, it's slow-paced, and the plot and characters are very trite and clichéd. Still, Walter Salles creates a nicely murky, dank atmosphere in his direction, Jennifer Connelly performs wonderfully, and Angelo Badalamenti provides a great score to make it watchable for its running time, though admittedly those elements aren't enough to make it worth a second watch. I would personally suggest watching "The Ring 2" instead since they are so similar and that film was stronger, including some magnificent moments and the always-wonderful Naomi Watts, but "Dark Water" isn't the train wreck many are calling it and is worthy of one viewing, as long as you're not too easily bored--in which case stay away from it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walter Salles' 2005 thriller "Dark Water" is an excellent study of the human mind. The direction is inspired and effective, and the acting is what you would expect from seasoned actors Connelly, Reilly, Postelwaithe, and Roth. The movie moves at a brilliant pace, and builds the audience up for a shocking climax. This remake of the 2002 Hideo Nakata film, was scripted by Nakata himself, and the material is spot-on. The actors handle it superbly and the viewer goes home thinking many different thoughts. However, the film was marketed as a horror/thriller, which many believed to be comparable to "The Ring", another Nakata story. It is not. There are a few scenes that may seem creepy to some, but that is all. Unfortunately, this wonderful film is receiving mixed reviews due to this reason, and it is sad. Overall, this film is an outstanding story about love and despair. If you go home feeling cheated, sleepy, or just plain angry; it's because it was not what you expected it to be. Blame marketing, not the film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has Potential, Yet Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to Dark Water hoping to see an original, well-thought horror movie plot like I did when I saw The Ring. Well, I have to admit, it was a bit original, but being original just for the sake of being original isn't always a good thing.The premise, I thought, was interesting. I liked how Dahlia was given a little quirk--in the beginning flashback, you see her waiting at school, and her mother is late for picking her up. The rest of the movie, she is always (except on one occasion) early to appointments she has. Connelly's acting was amazing for the material she was given. All of the actors were great at delivering their characters, especially Dahlia's daughter, Ceci.Even with the good acting and interesting premise, though, the ending was disappointing. My friend and I were sitting at least a minute after the credits had started, waiting for something else to happen. I had been hoping for something that would tie everything together, like I saw in The Ring. Unfortunately, it never came--they never even explained why the water was "dark," although it was suggested to me that the water where the girl died was probably dirty, making it dark.Still, though, I was deeply disappointed by the movie. As much as the movie was original, there were also points in the movie where I was wondering, "Is this just The Ring Three in disguise?" Though it's very hard to be original these days, you shouldn't be original at the expense of plot continuity and suspense. I was frightened at maybe four points in the entire movie, and the final climax could've been longer, more developed, and scarier.All in all, this movie doesn't make me angry, mostly disappointed and sad. The acting was great--it's what makes me rate this a 5 instead of 4--and the beginning idea was interesting up until I realized that everything wasn't going to come together. Plus, the author of this story (the author of The Ring) must have some fetish with girls drowning or something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was very great. It mixed great things in like horror and mystery. It has a very good story and the actors are perfect. I loved this movie. This is like a mix between the movies The Ring and Hide and Seek. I liked those two movies. If you have seen them and didn't like them, you probably wouldn't like this movie. I think that this movie is worth paying full price to see. If you like the genres of horror/suspense/mystery, then you would like this movie most likely. Of course everyone has their own opinion, but i really did enjoy this movie. The water was a very creepy source in this movie, as revealed by the title. Once you watch this movie, you will come out of the theater with your moneys worth of enjoyment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good movie. A psychological thriller with an absence of gore, but it's predominantly a uniquely clever ghost story.The story unfolds slowly, but not so slowly you get bored. One fellow moviegoer exclaimed to her companions that she had "goosebumps".It builds up to a helluva climax and then really wallops you with a very unexpected and sad ending. A mind blowing, tearjerker of a finale. You will spend the rest of the day contemplating this movie. Tears welled up in my eyes because the ending is very moving and communicates the depth of a mother's love for her child.This movie is in the same vein as The Ring and The Grudge but this one is my favorite of the three with The Grudge coming in second and The Ring coming in third.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Downbeat ghost story, satisfying up to a point...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Newly-separated Jennifer Connelly moves herself and her child into an apartment building across the river from Manhattan, and immediately an ominous-looking water stain on the bedroom ceiling spells danger. Director Walter Salles, working from both the novel by Kôji Suzuki and the 2002 Japanese original from Hideo Nakata, doesn't go for "Ring"-styled bombast; he's much more subtle and interested in the nuances of character, the underlining paranoia in the narrative, and in the very tense atmosphere. He has obviously studied Roman Polanski's tenement terrors and knows a great deal about creating suspense from mood and ambiance (he allows the viewer to think the worst without ever getting so graphic). Unfortunately, the source material itself is what trips Salles up. Polanski would have eschewed most of the red herrings and the mystery plot about the little girl upstairs who got left behind (a parallel to Connelly's unhappy childhood). This thread actually becomes the whole movie, leading to a curious, unhappy climax. Sadly, in today's market, you can't have a big-budget spooky movie be all about character and paranoia; this is where the exploding faucets come in--and where director Salle's style can only take the film so far before it becomes waterlogged. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I waited a long time to see this. I had a feeling I shouldn't see it in the theater, and this time, I was right. I would have been mad to have paid to see it. Encore ran it last week and, while I did find it both enjoyable and entertaining, it didn't seem to know what it wanted to do or where it wanted to go.The atmosphere was awesome, and the premise was a solid idea, but the story kind of ran out there at the end, with seemingly no point to the work. Some would argue that I just didn't understand the ending, but that simply isn't the case. I "got" it, it just didn't work for me and, if the IMDb score for this movie is any indication, it didn't work for most other movie-goers, either.I am a fan of horror, mystery, and suspense thrillers. This does fit into that category, as an atmospheric thriller, but the story kind of wanders, while the sub-plot fails to generate sympathy for the lead character, though it was intended to do so.All in all, I did find it compelling, if somewhat rambling, and did derive some enjoyment from Connolly's performance, which was outstanding.It rates a 5.2/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I went into a store to buy a can of Mountain Dew, but when I opened the thing it turned out to contain Dr. Pepper, I'd be angry. I would never buy Dr. Pepper. If the can says "Mountain Dew" it had better damn well contain Mountain Dew. Similarly, when a studio markets a movie as being in the horror genre, I expect horror. What I got was a snail paced Lifetime movie of the week. I'm surprised that Meredith Baxter-Birney didn't play the mom in this movie.Seriously, nothing scary or interesting happens in this movie for the first hour and fifteen minutes. NOTHING. A single mother with emotional problems moves into a crappy apartment with her daughter. Her ex-husband is a dick, she can't get over her past, and her daughter starts talking to an imaginary friend. Oh, and there's a leak in the ceiling of her apartment. It leaks water. Brown water. Super scary DARK WATER. Oh wait, it's not scary at all. It's just annoying and wet. Actually, it looks like Dr. Pepper. The mother tries to get the apartment maintenance man to fix it, but he refuses. She calls the guy's boss, and he tells her to tell him to fix it. She tells him. He tells her no. She calls the boss back and tells him that he told her he wouldn't fix it. He tells her that he'll call him himself and tell him to fix it. Meanwhile, her ex-husband is threatening to sue her for full custody of their annoying daughter. Her apartment still leaks. She still hasn't gotten over her unhappy childhood. And now she may lose her own child! Are we bored yet? Yes. Are we scared? No. Dark Water is yet another PG-13 Hollywood remake of a Japanese "horror" movie. What this means is that the movie has little to no gore or nudity, so it has to rely on nothing but atmosphere. A woman walks into a room. There's nothing scary about the room, and nothing scary happens. But the movie lets us know we're supposed to be scared because some spooky music starts playing. The leak in the ceiling is not scary, but the movie let's us know it's supposed to be REALLY scary because not only do we get the spooky music, we also get close-ups of the spot where the water leaks. If I wanted ONLY atmosphere, I'd watch the Weather Channel.After what seems to be an eternity, we finally find out that the woman's daughter's imaginary friend is bad. We know she's bad because spooky music starts playing whenever the little girl talks to her. It turns out that her friend is really the ghost of another little girl who died in the apartment building. Oh, did I mention that the apartment building has a big water tank on the roof? Hmmmmm, the movie is called Dark Water, there's a tank of water on the roof. Hey, is that spooky music I just heard? Yes, the body of the dead girl is found in the tank of water. Someone learned the truth behind her death, and now her spirit can finally rest. And if you didn't see that coming at least a half an hour before it happened, you must be 5 years old and have never seen a ghost movie before. The last 10 minutes of this movie are actually quite good, but they weren't worth the first 95 minutes. Just when you think all is well, the little girl's ghost actually materializes in the flesh and tries to kill the woman's daughter. It's the only scene in the movie that's anything close to horror. To save her daughter, the woman agrees to stay with the ghost. But, in order to do that, she has to become a ghost herself, and she dies! I enjoy it when a movie kills off it's main character, and I thought it was a satisfactory twist. (Although if they'd killed her in the FIRST 5 minutes instead of the last, I could have saved myself 105 minutes to stare at a blank wall).The movie was well acted, and the sets and color scheme provided plenty of that oh so important atmosphere. But at the end of the day, this movie is a clichéd, soporific, estrogen laden drama wrapped up in a horror coating. If that's what you're looking for, you'll love it. Real horror fans need not apply.Oh, I almost forgot. Tim Roth pops up in this movie. That made me think about Reservoir Dogs. That was the best part of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Started off pretty good, with good atmosphere and great flow of story despite being pretty slow. The bad part is it doesn't get any anywhere. There is no more story development, no nothing until the last 15 min of the movie.Synopsis: A mother and daughter was force to take up the rundown apartment after the divorce unknowingly they are haunted by the ghost that live above them.What really annoying me the most is the fact that the movie have somewhat 15 min of idea which has been extended to 1 ? hours. And the rest is just full of unnecessary stuff that doesn't make this movie any better. Practically if you watch the last 15 min of the movie, you watch the whole movie. I feel totally riff off by this.I wouldn't lie to you but the reason why this is such a hit is because of Jennifer Connelly and John C. Reilly, they are terrific actor and they make this movie a bit more watchable. The little girl is cute and the whole cast give quite a good performance. That seems to be the only attraction in the movie.I didn't read the tagline of this movie before I watch it. What a crucial mistake, because it will tell you what to expect from this movie. "Some mysteries were never meant to be solved." And it does delivered what it said this movie doesn't solve anything or even give a conclusive ending. I hate the fact that they make the main character so stupid.Recommendation: I think this is a waste of time.Reason To Watch: Good acting, Atmosphere has been created brilliantly.Reason Not To: - Long for no reason. Middle of the movie is fill with nothing.Rating: 3/10 (Grade: F)</fullReview>

I wanted to rate it a 2 out of 10 but I didn't do it because that would just be too sad. anyways I don't find this movie all that good at all. I like the old dark water movie with the Chinese people playing in it. I like the older movie because I find it more scarier,interesting, and also there is many scary things happening I just love that movie. The older movie is a cool movie I thing it's also good because of the actors. In this movie I don't think the actors did a great job.

		<shortDescription>A dark picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I appreciate Jennifer Connelly as an actress (and she doesn't disappoint me in this movie), the story falls fall short of being a good movie or even one that I would recommend.Dark is the best description one can use to describe this movie. Things just keep going from bad to worse. Just when you think you have already seen the worst and it can only get better, it gets worse.In reality, the movie is a bad fantasy, a bad dream from start to finish and very depressing. It is unfortunate because the story did have the potential of turning out good. It is really a horror story and if I had known that before I watched it, I would have avoided it.Part of the problem with the movie is that it isn't tied together very well. It begins with a little child standing out in the rain after school waiting for her mother to pick her up. But it was so poorly done that viewers can never be certain what relevance the opening scene has to do with what is happening to Connelly later on. The significance of the incident is lost on the viewers and if Connelly's childhood has something to do with what is occurring to her in her adult life, the connection is lost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sufficiently Creepy and Dramatic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a 'horror' film- you're not going to see monsters jump out at you or feel like throwing up afterwards from the gore you've seen. It's none of those clichés of frightening films today, and, in my opinion, that's what makes it really good.This is a drama about a mother and daughter who are struggling to adapt to their new lifestyle alone. The mother has recently divorced from her husband, the girl's father, and now the two must move to a new and rather dilapidated old apartment complex. There, they encounter a spirit who is, in a way, yearning in the same way they each are, and it won't rest until it makes them feel it's pain.The cast really is amazing here. Jennifer Connelly turns in brilliant work, as usual. She is the definition of a great actress. The little girl, Ariel Gade, is quite good herself, especially considering her age. Tim Roth, Camryn Manheim, John C. Reilly, Dougray Scott, and Pete Postlethwait are all well cast for each of their respective roles. All do a fine job, giving this film another step above others of its genre- great acting abounds.Really, there's not much left to be desired from this dramatic thriller- they did it all well. It won't stand out as one of the best films you've seen, but it is good and very easy to watch. The creeps are supplied well, the drama feels very real, and the ending will quite possibly make you cry. 6/10 stars for me! Jay Addison</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not scary enough for horror, not smart enough to thrill *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start out by saying thematically, this movie was well conveyed. Using Roosevelt Island and its brutalist architecture was a notable success for the locations department.Unfortunately, I feel this film falls quite short of being much of a horror movie or think piece.I saw the original Dark Water a couple years ago and was pretty happy with it. Needless to say, my hopes were certainly a little high after seeing it as well as the previous translations of The Ring and The Grudge. I could see that this film was setting out to darken the tone of the original story but it felt very empty in the end.Now, I want to try and be objective about this, so I'll step away from the comparisons.I found the pace of this movie to be terribly slow. I don't mind a steady ramp into the tension of a thriller, but the first act of this film just left me unimpressed. I understand the divorce and subsequent events early on are meant to serve as a catalyst for the climax, but I felt it was far too prominent and a bit forced. We can all understand bitter custody battles and divorces, there's no reason to so blatantly illustrate every painful detail. This film is not a family drama or ABC movie of the week. Such a situation could be summed up very quickly and established in a matter of minutes. The ongoing dispute rarely made an impact on the situations in the film. For the most part, they came off as rather arbitrary. Almost as if they were trying to elaborate the fact that so many horror movies in Asia seem to focus on single mothers.There were also some great opportunities for interesting plot twists that were missed or even left wide open.**SPOILER ALERT**Why didn't they follow up on the delinquent teens who were somehow involved with her husband?What ever became of the girl's family and the attorney's investigation of them?I think these are two plot points that could have really made the film much more dramatic but the filmmakers chose to ignore these things.Furthermore, Dark Water deserves little recognition for making me think. Every little thing (that wasn't completely neglected - see above) was spelled out far too quickly. Every time I thought I might have to think about something, lo and behold! They shove the explanation down my throat! And sure, the mystery behind the girl and her family wasn't immediately clarified, but it was painfully obvious where it was going. I wasn't the least bit surprised seeing as this is a ghost story. It felt like a really poor remake of the remake of The Ring (finding bodies in wells, bad parenting, etc).In summation, I'm but one voice in a world of opinions, but I was really let down by this movie, regardless of whether it was meant to be a horror film or thriller.I don't condemn the viewing of this film, but I sure don't recommend it if you're looking for The Ring or The Sixth Sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks the Horror, that is usually associated with the Horror Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dark Water is very atmospheric and quite creepy, but it definitely omits the usual horror elements, like shocks and in your face scares; in fact it has more drama than horror, we see the personal struggles of a mother who is desperate to protect her daughter from something that resides in their low rent apartment, while a custody battle with her ex-husband looms large.Jennifer Connelly is excellent in her role, she captures the strain and stress that her character is under very convincingly, and she deserves a great deal of credit for that.The biggest issue i had with this film was the inept failure to hide the mystery, its too easy to guess the end; so when it does arrive it leaves the viewer with a feeling of dissatisfaction.Its not a bad movie, in fact some aspects of it are quite brilliant, but some is not enough.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A brilliant film, with an absorbing storyline. The characters were played well, I recognised the lead actress (Jennifer Connelly) from 'The Labrynth' made 15 years ago! Perhaps a better ending would've been Connelly's daughter dying (instead of Connelly) and the police thinking it was the mother who did it, but in fact it was Natasha... This would raise questions such-as: Maybe Natasha was a figment of Connelly's imagination, not her daughter's. The lawyer would then try and figure out what happened, perhaps the ghost of Natasha really did do it, and Connelly got the blame... Still an interesting and absorbing film, with a good performance from Jennifer Connely and supporting actors. One to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All the fun of the ring, only half the evil.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm still waiting for a horror film to come out and impress me. I'm beginning to tire of all the same plot lines just being re-used and recycled. Where is the creativity in Hollywood? Dark Water, in my opinion, was nothing more than the ring taking place in an apartment. Now, for any student who has lived in student housing the plumbing situation isn't really that scary. I understand that it is difficult to write an ending to a ghost story without leaving some loose threads, but it can be done. The ending of this movie was an attempt to break away from the ring and other similar movies. Thats fine, I'm all for originality, but being different does not mean its good. I found that everyone in the movie was just a little to happy with the way their character turned out. Make no mistake, this movie ends badly for all parties involved, but still everyone seems to be okay with the situation. In all, this movie suffers from a sever lack of character development, lack of any real plot, and a severe lack of creativity. That being said, it was not the worst horror film i have ever seen, after all, Rob Zombie is still making films right? So i have passed this movie, but only by the narrowest of margins. You might want to wait until this one is shown back to back on TBS instead of renting it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If house floods scare you ,then this flick is made for you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh boy.First of all I'd like to say I'm not against remakes in general. The remake has a very big disadvantage since it will doubtlessly be compared to the original (which has to be somewhat good, otherwise he wouldn't inspire the remake) so it's not really fair to be too hard on it. Besides, if you'd loved the original it's always fun to look how other director/cast interpreted the thing.What I DO hate is when movie people start "improving" the original, putting in all sorts of their ideas and solutions in order to 1) distance themselves from the original and 2) make the movie more suited for intended audience. Perhaps some directors can pull this off, but usually (and especially when it is the case of American remakes) the "improving" consists of heavy overexplaining of the plot and augmented use of special effects. I don't get this - does Hollywood really think American audience is soo stupid they must be led by hand the entire movie, and God forbid something ambiguous was left at the ending? Or that without "extra" special effects average American will not be able to sit tight for an hour and a half? Geez.Japanese "Dark Water" wasn't a great flick, but it worked on some key levels. It was a moody story about mother and child living in haunted apartment. For the most part it didn't have many scares, but a few motifs were used beautifully (the bag, yellow raincoat). And much like Ringu, the creepiest stuff happened in the end when your defenses were more or less down which for me, well, worked.Enter the American version. If they remade it scene by scene it would be unimaginative, but it might have worked. Yet, they opined for a different path, which obviously consisted of identifying all the elements of the original that worked, and then replacing them with other elements which are more or less pointless.First of all there's that dreaded overexplaining and overexpositioning. OK, Dahlia's mother was alcoholic, WE GET IT, enough with the flashbacks already. Then there's some added material for some supporting roles which serves absolutely no purpose. Tim Roth for instance has some scenes that are there only so he can get some more screen time.But what is most unforgivable is what they did to the whole "creepiness" of the story. When you go to see a horror/suspense/thriller movie, you are in for the thrills. Yet in "Dark Water" there are is absolutely nothing remotely scary or creepy except the blue hue the movie was shot in. Let me reiterate this - there is NOTHING SCARY in this movie. There's just lots and lots and lots of water and many scenes of flooded apartments.As I've already mentioned, the original went something like moody-creepy-moody-creepy-OHHELLNOWTHATSCREEPY-moody. The remake is moody-moody-wet-wet-wet-moody. The scenes which should scare us are at best - confusing. Instead of being thrilled or scared, you'll have either a confused or "get on with it already" look on your face.If I started dissecting what they did wrong in the movie, the list would never end. Here are just some of the things. There are basically three key child actors in this movie (I won't say more to avoid spoilers) yet all three of them are so similar it is really hard to discern them - which is bad, since this is the key for following the plot or *ahem* being scared in a few scenes. What is worse, this was obviously an intentional decision, since even their clothing is almost identical. The director must have tried to put some point across, but what he achieved is needless confusion. Furthermore, all the potentially scary motifs are gone except for the water. Message for the director: WATER IS NOT CREEPY, AND ADDING MORE WATER DOES NOT MAKE IT CREEPIER. I don't know what he was thinking, probably the test audience consisted of a bunch of aquaphobics.I could go on and on but I will finish with the thing what bothered me the most: the ending. I didn't like the original ending, but it kinda worked, and I was interested in the remake mostly because I wanted to see a reinterpretation of that few key horrifying scenes near the end. Boy, was I in for a treat. The remake went for a thematically similar but really a totally different ending, with NO SCARY SCENES at all, except it went nuts with amounts of, yes you guessed it, WATER. So much for getting my money's worth.Anyway, the bottom line is this is not just a bad remake but a bad sample of the genre. You will be bored and just perhaps slightly moved (the daughter is cute and you kinda care what happens to her) but you won't be scared and you definitely won't be satisfied.Except you are really scared of water, then this will be a true ride of terror.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jennifer Connelly, John C. Reilly, Tim Roth...familiar names and fine performers all. Throw in Pete Postlethwaite, Dougray Scott, Camryn Manheim and a sufficiently precocious child actress and you've got quite the little ensemble. But with Dark Water you still don't get a good movie. It's a "horror" film which doesn't frighten, a personal drama which fails to engage and the whole thing is rather plodding to boot. When the inevitable "big moment" finally arrives you may find yourself saying, "Is that all there is?"As Dahlia, a young, recently divorced mother trying to find her way in the world, Connelly does a remarkably good job with what she's given to work with. She's the emotional centerpiece of the film and it falls on her to hold the whole thing together and she manages to pull it off despite the less than stellar material she's given. As the manager of the dingy apartment Dahlia and her daughter move into Reilly is a treat, the best thing the film has to offer. He steals every scene he's in and adds what little humor the movie has. And after sitting through this whole thing you need a few laughs. Roth has a bit part as Dahlia's lawyer and turns in quality work as well, as does Postlethwaite as the brooding, gruff and mysterious apartment superintendent. The acting's not the problem, the story's the problem. It takes forever to get moving and the promised scares provoke maybe nervous giggles but certainly no genuine frights. Toss another one into the "unnecessary Japanese horror remake" pile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching The Ring, you can't take Dark Water seriously without thinking foul play on the writing credits. Let me name some similarities. Both involve a woman divorced or separated from husband or boyfriend that have a little child between them. Both also involve a girl that has been abused or neglected by the parents, and ends up dead, which proceeds into haunting. It has become the mandatory duty of the woman to take these matters into her own hands and amend what went wrong with these ghost's. And guess what, both are drowned in a well. I mean come on, whoever wrote Dark Water, couldn't have thought of aaaaanything different? I mean, how about the girl falls down the elevator shaft or something? At least that idea will rip off Kindom Hospital or maybe The Eye, but it would be a break from stealing everything from The Ring. I don't even care if Dark Water was written first, I would have just been upset about it and changed the story a little. And I like how when the kids were being founded in the wells, that they both seemed to be "alive" for a moment of shock. The Ring nailed it a little better and had a skeleton in the well in all reality. Dark Water however, was a perfectly preserved girl. Next time, write your own script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far too muddy a plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've long been and admirer of Jennifer Connelly's work and have followed her career for some time, from the child role Labryinth to the one-dimensional sex role of Career Opportunities to her evolution into one of America's premier actresses (Pollock, A Beautiful Mind, House of Sand and Fog, Requiem for a Dream). She's a fantastic talent, with tremendous range that prevents her (to a degree) from being pigeonholed.But her latest, Dark Water, is a senseless pile of dung. Not to slight the more-sensitive piles of dung out there, of course, but this one just isn't terribly comprehensible. It's schizophrenic - does it want to be a psychological thriller, a la Gaslight, or does it want to be a haunted-apartment thriller? Let me tell you, this movie couldn't carry Gaslight's water, pun strongly intended. It has twelve times the special effects but one hundredth the quality. There's no real chills, nothing that'll set your teeth on edge.Dahlia Williams (Connelly) is newly separated from her husband and they're bitterly fighting over their young daughter, Ceci. Dahlia moves into an old apartment building to start a new life, but she quickly runs into a couple of major problems: the giant leak in her apartment and the sudden appearance of an invisible friend for Ceci.If you've seen Hide and Seek, or any movie in which an invisible friend appears (oh no, another pun), you know how adults react in these movies: They don't believe the kid. Ceci insists her new friend Natasha is real, and yet there are no other children in the apartment building, according to building owner Mr. Murray (John C. Reilly). And so Ceci acts out in her new class, and the leak grows and grows..Is Dahlia going crazy? Is her husband trying to drive her insane, so she'll give up the custody battle? Some evidence points to him, and then it's quickly dropped as a story thread. To buttress the case for Something Being Awry, we're given a bit of Dahlia's own history; apparently her mother was a neglectful drunk, and something about the rain and water and such, and you can see how Dahlia might go bonkers with water leaking in her tiny apartment.I can forgive an awful lot in movies - you have to, really; it's call suspension of disbelief - but when a movie trots out all kinds of possible explanations and never seems to settle on one, I'm not so forgiving. What should have been suspenseful was merely amusing; what should have startled me I saw coming. I think you will, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The American remake, "Dark Water," isn't a bad film; it's just that it's not a terribly good film.That isn't the fault of Jennifer Connelly, who actually is very good in this film. The fault lies with screenwriter Rafael Yglesias and director Walter Salles. They don't hide the fact that they're trying to pay homage, if not emulate, Roman Polanski's "Rosemary's Baby" (1968) with a slight nod to his earlier brilliant film, "Repulsion" (1965). But Polanski is a master at what he does and used the building and the apartments in his movies as characters; they became part of the film and he did it effortlessly.Here, Salles spends so much time trying to evoke a certain mood, build atmosphere that it becomes too obvious. And Polanski never lost sight of the fact that he had to keep the tension mounting, keep us hooked in the story and could never let the pacing lag. Neither Yglesias nor Salles bother about such minor details."Dark Water" lags for a horror film. The pacing, at times, is horribly slow. The shocks - most of which are audio cues than anything else - are telegraphed or predictable.Connelly, who truly is one of our finest actresses, does superbly in a role that requires much more than what's on the written page. In fact, she takes Yglesias' rather mundane script and turns her character into someone utterly believable. Connelly's ability to express an entire range of emotions with no dialogue, with just a look, a sigh, a deep breath, is downright amazing.I felt sorry for her watching this film because she's bravely plugging away while the film amounts to no more than a novel idea. The concept certainly is intriguing and could be a spine-tingling thriller. But Yglesias never bothers to tap beneath the surface - and adding a quick back story to Connelly's character does not amount to adding depth - and Salles seems so wrapped up in the set decoration and the surroundings of the characters that he forgets this is a horror film.I kept asking myself why this film wasn't scary. Or suspenseful, for that matter. I wasn't looking for gore or slasher-horror - that stuff's garbage. What I was looking for was an eerie story that makes us nervous, scares us, jolts us occasionally and keeps us on edge. But all the guess work is taken out of this story and even actors of the caliber of Connelly, John C. Reilly, Tim Roth and Dougray Scott can't pull this one out of the water.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why, but lately it seems that some directors have decided that it's desirable to film a movie practically in the dark. It is so frustrating to watch a movie when you can't really see what is going on. I realize that sometimes it is necessary for the setting to be dark to lend authenticity to the scene, but to film almost the entire movie where you can hardly even see anyone's face or what's in the room, it's extremely annoying. I kept thinking of the recent version of "House of Wax" too while I was watching this movie. That director also somehow concluded that it would be good to film an entire movie where the audience seldomly could even see what was going on. I think I'll avoid any more horror movies by these two directors.Chris</fullReview>

The thing about this movie is that it is not a horror movie! Don't expect to see anything you haven't already seen. Don't expect to learn anything you don;t already know. It is a very predictable story with no real plot line nor surprises. The directing was not bad, but I had the feeling that something was constantly missing. The music and sound effects were not so coordinated with what the viewer was seeing so the atmosphere was neither smooth nor appealing for a horror movie. The only good thing about the movie were the combination of the colors (light and dark brown combined with green, yellow and black which added a bit to the "horror" atmosphere) and the acting since it has a pretty good cast especially Jen. Connelly who was doing everything she could. In my opinion the conclusion is: Don't pay to watch this movie on the big screen! It's better to rent it on DVD and watch it at your place only if you like the actors and have nothing else to see. But in any case, don't expect much!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a disappointment...When I saw Walter Salles's (The Motorcylce Diaries) name attached to this project, I was convinced it would be good. Ever since Gore Verbinksi proved horror moves could be good with The Ring, I've been excited for horror movies directed by good directors.Good cast. Jennifer Connelly (whose amazing beauty and talent could be made into a movie all by itself) really delivers the goods with her portrayal as a recently-single mother in the midst of a custody battle over her lovable daughter, Ceci. She sets her character up as a reasonable, but vulnerable person, paving the way for the horror to take its toll. John C. Reilly (my second favorite actor after Christian Bale) does pretty well, but really doesn't shine (like he did in Magnolia). Both Tim Roth and Pete Postlethwaite are excellent in their roles. (I didn't even recognize Tim Roth at first!)Story. This is were it gets a little complicated. This film really has two stories, which rarely ever converge. The first is the story of Dahlia's (Connelly) custody battle with her ex-husband. Instead of serving as merely a backdrop to boost the horror later on, this conflict is really drawn out and eventually overshadows the horror story. The second is the horror story. The new apartment that Dahlia has purchased is located right under a room that has been flooded knee deep with water. The question is, who left the water running if there's supposed to be nobody up there? Soon after, Ceci starts seeing an imaginary friend who quickly becomes more than just imaginary. The ending makes sense (rare for a horror movie) but feels misplaced because of the heavy emphasis on the first story.If this had been simply a drama about a woman caught up in a bitter custody battle with her belligerent ex-husband, it would've been a very good one. One I'd even consider buying on DVD. But the little horror elements scattered about make it more than just a drama, but not quite a horror. I think Walter Salles did his best to make a good horror film (and partially succeeded), but wasn't quite ready to tackle the genre. A good movie, but not a good horror movie.</fullReview>

Absorbing psychological thriller combining elements of "Jacob's Ladder", "Repulsion", "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Ring" (the latter thanks to that auteur Hideo Nakata, who helmed the original Japanese "J horror" flick this Americanized adaptation is based upon) with the beguilingly beautiful Connelly as a recently separated mother who takes her daughter to move into a dank apartment housing project on New York's Roosevelt Island with a foreboding menace amidst its dank enclave (think The Dakota in "Rosemary's Baby"). Water imagery everywhere tends to get soggy but Rafael Yglesias' take adds subtle layers eschewing shock and gore for dread and fear that filmmaker Walter Salles employs using Angelo Badalamenti's atmospheric score, Affonso Beato's impressionistic dark cinematography of bruised browns and unearthly green/blues and Therese DePrez' claustrophobic production design to full effect. An eclectic eccentrically played cast (Reilly as an unscrupulous lug of a real estate broker, Postlethwaite as the building's creepy superintendent and Roth as a fly-by-night lawyer are all wonderful and the young Gade is equally compelling as her on screen mother; Connelly plumbs no depths of maternal instincts ? which may give some a shock by the film's change-of-pace climax).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's what happened when I went to see the movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually, when we hear that the United States has remade a foreign movie, it's time to start groaning in despair. Not so with "Dark Water". An ingenious thriller helmed by "The Motorcycle Diaries" director Walter Salles, the movie succeeds where too many movies have failed.Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) has just gone through a nasty divorce. So, she and her daughter Cecilia (Ariel Gade) move into an apartment on Roosevelt Island. Looking at the apartment complex, almost anyone might get turned off: not only does it look like something put up by the old Soviet bureaucracy, but the whole place is pretty dreary. But, she and Ceci like it enough, to move in. But then, strange things start happening. A leak from the next floor won't stop, and a lot of the water from the sinks and washer is much darker than it should be. What is causing this? The answer lies in some unpleasant events of the building's past.Part of what was so good about this movie was the use of shadows: very few scenes are without shadows, rain, or something else to give a sense of fear. Pete Postlethwaite, as security guard Veeck, is the sort of character whom you aren't sure whether or not to suspect of something. Even if "Dark Water" doesn't leave you with a sense of mortal fear, you will most likely feel that you want to think twice before trying to move into any place.Here's just a little aside. When I went to see the movie, it was out of focus, and they kept stopping it and restarting it. Finally, they decided that they couldn't fix it, so they just gave us passes to see a later showing. But that's just a side note. It's a pretty good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carefully Calibrated Supernatural Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No jump-out-and-grab you moments; no gore; no violence. Instead, a carefully calibrated supernatural drama with shrewd casting and terrific performances. Dark Water is more of a thriller than a typical horror and is in the vein films like The Sixth Sense, Rosemary's Baby and The Shining. It's disappointing to see that this superbly crafted film hasn't connected better with viewers and critics. For me, it was a refreshing to see a film that didn't rely on typical Hollywood staples like video game pacing, vfx, violence and gore. Excellent casting, even in the smaller roles. Uncommonly great performances (when you consider this genre) by the entire cast, even in the smaller roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth it for a woman.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>America has the disgusting habit of cutting right to the quick when it comes to films which was evident when I went and saw Dark Water last night. Comments I heard as I was leaving the theater resembled something along the lines of "It was horroreqsue enough for me". Instead of appreciating the film for what it was, a woman struggling with issues of abandonment and questioning your own sanity, people walked in their expecting the "Boo!" factor of The Ring or the Grudge. The real terror comes from the ambiguity of Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) and her ability to take care of both herself and her daughter. Without realizing it she loses time due to "migraines" and misses her daughter's phone calls, she often has to lie down, misses an emergency phone call from her daughter's school and has visions of her own mother's rejection. The ghost of the young girl Natasha hops throughout the film and hovers on the border of being friendly or threatening. Her appearances in the film and her interaction with mother and daughter have a tense air to them, almost like approaching a lost dog on a street and hesitating to check the tag around its neck for fear of being bit. When the ghost of Natasha finds out they're planning to leave all hell breaks loose, including a large chunk of the wall that forces Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) to make a choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>boo hiss. these are the only two words that can express what my first feeling about this movie were. At first i was really excited to see this movie because it looked like a good scary movie. the whole movie wasn't bad, just about the last half hour. it does a good job of leaving you in suspense but when you get to the end it takes all hopes you had of this being a good movie, and runs them over with an 18-wheeler. I kind of wish that i was a critic because then I would write in every possible publication throughout the world, and i would picket every movie theater showing this movie, and tell people to save their 7 bucks for a better movie. It looks like the director started out with a good script and then somebody came in and said "huh how can we make this more like the ring?....... I know lets have a little girl haunt people and then find out later that she drowned, and then we can drown jennifer connelly so that the little girl haunting everybody that had a sad life can have a mommy. If you want to watch a scary movie i would say to run far far away from this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It takes too long for anything interesting to happen. Everything is dark all the time. Pete Postlethwaite is his usual sinister self, John C. Reilly is his usual competent self, Jennifer Connelly is a good actress, and the kid is cute, but none of this can save a movie where nothing happens except dark dank walls. It takes way too long for Connelly to go looking around and find something. It goes on forever this sequence of murky threatening scenes with no outcome. The movie is about twice as long as need be. And there's too much phoniness, as when she sees her ex talking to the two boys, and then at the end he obviously wants to get back together with her. Playing with the audience, it's too easy to do, it's a cheap way out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dark Water is the remake of the 2002 Japanese cult film "Dark Water" directed by Hideo Nakata. The movie is about a mother Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) and daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade) who move into an apartment complex in New Jersey after a divorce separation. When a water leak occurs mysterious occurrences begin to happen around the building with a ghost like figure that terrorizes Ceci. Although being a low budget film this film delivers great performances by Jennifer Connely and Tim Roth but the overall is that the film is ultimately boring with several small frights. Dark Water delivers a tasteless,bland and soggy film with a horribly boring storyline. 1.5/5* Stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Movie Blew Harder than Yeltsin into a Breathalizer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never written comments on a movie before. But I have never felt so robbed and cheated before either. I keep seeing great reviews of this movie and I just really don't think that's fair to you dear readers who be suckered as I was. If you want to see it - I encourage you not to - PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY SAVE YOUR $7.25 - there will be some spoilers in this post, but if you've seen the Ring One or Two it's been spoiled for you before you've even gone into the theater.Worth noting is that it was in fact written by the same man, Koji Suzuki, who wrote the Ring. I liked the Ring. It was creepy - it was an interesting twist and it was far more psychological than blood and gore. There is that element of what makes people behave the way they do - what would you do, etc. with that added creepy element of "Where do ghosts fit on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs?" Here are the obvious problems with the movie. It's slow as hell - it doesn't just set up the characters, it beats you over the head with them. Neurotic Mommy with her own abandonment issues, trying to be a better mother than her own was, cute vulnerable kid who gets creepy looking as she plays with "imaginary friend". We get it. We could have got it in ten minutes really because this is how every horror movie is set up lately. We didn't need 40 minutes of build-up. I'm pretty sure the only scene they left out was Jennifer Connoly filing her nails while her daughter drew watched t.v. It's that enthralling people! I had the potential to care about these characters except a.) We've seen them before in movies and b) the movie treats me, a viewer, as if I am still unable to get them - here's 20 more minutes of build-up.But it's build-up for something that NEVER COMES! The creepiest they can get are some leaky pipes, dirty water, and running children feet in the apartment above them. That ain't creepy it's called my apartment.Ohhh and horror of horror - there is creepy long black hair that comes out of the pipes into her drinking water. Hmm...where have I seen this before - oh that's right - THE RING! Another terror inducing moment - an unbalanced washing machine with dirty water seeping out. OH MY GOD!! I get what they are trying to do - is mom crazy, or are they being tormented by a ghost tenant? I get it - no really I do. Seriously I GET IT! But instead of leaving it open for the viewer to decide I think it weighs too heavily on the side of - "oooh creepy ghost child!" Sidebar: Can we quit with the creepy child being effected by ghost babies?! It's been done, and while I am a single 20 something - and therefore terrified of children in all forms and find them all to be creepy and unsettling - I think Hollywood can quit with the spooky kid motif. (Sixth Sense, The Ring - 1 &amp; 2, Hide and Seek, Amityville Horror, The Grudge, etc) Can't we just get back to the psycho killer genre? Elements totally reused from the Ring: Kid has scary communication with dead kid, draws spooky pictures, it rains a crap load - never a sunny day, lighting leaves mom looking haggard and dirty, creepy ghost kid wants to real live kid, water, mystery black hair (really scary and universal fear so I understand it's importance), dead ghost kid's body found floating. But wait - it's totally different she was in a water tower - NOT A WELL - Completely different! In Conclusion: Since we have the Ring 1 and 2 already I will dub this the Ring 1 and 1/2 (Sort of like the Lion King Franchise). It's basically - ooh what if Rachel (Naomi Watts) had given in to Samara and just loved her and taken care of her like Samara wanted all along. Well now we find out. It could have been a good dream sequence in the Ring. Rachel could have woken up to resolutely decide - I'm gonna kick some serious ghost baby ass!! Unless your like me, without air conditioning, don't waste your time. But if you could use a good 1 and 55 minute snooze in an air conditioned theater - go for it.My remark as I walked out the theater "weak" The man sitting in front of me, his remark, "That was horrible" Consider us your new Ebert and Roper.</fullReview>

At least you are a hydrophobic that is not going to scare you. And another thing: Did they have a low budget for this movie??? It looked to me that they repeated a couple of scenes...Or it was lack of creativity, because the scenes where almost the same, if not the same (She in from of the mirror taking pills, and the ambulances at the entrance of the building). This movie does not scare you at all! B-O-R-I-N-G: BORING!!!! Yes, another disappointment of this summer...What's up Hollywood???</fullReview>

It had a couple of moments that scared me, but the music in this film was misleading. It would seem that something scary was going to happen, and then nothing happened. The movie was extremely slow and anticlimactic.Go see something else if you really want to be scared ! Also, I think it was more of a tragedy than a horror movie. By the end, I felt sad and confused. I'm tired of these movies where kids see or hear ghosts. Can't we have an original movie once in a while ? I was excited to see this movie, but was completely disappointed by it.

		<shortDescription>"Dark Water" Runs Shallow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been seeing the trailers for "Dark Water" for about 6 months and after much anticipation, I was disappointed.This film has much going for it. The photography is beautiful and so is Jennifer Connelly. She especially looks good sopping wet. The music is also very atmospheric.On the downside, the script is basically about the horror of living in an apartment with bad plumbing and the landlord says the grounds keeper should fix it and the grounds keeper says that the landlord needs to get a plumber. This is the majority of the film.There is a bit of supernatural thrown in at the end, but it seems out of place and it is an awful lot like the "Ring Part 2." It is still worth seeing for the music, photography, and Jennifer Connelly; but it should have had a better script.</fullReview>

The movie never gets going, and waits to long to establish what the actual point is! As for a ghost story; again we wait to long to get to any terrifying moments. Because of this the movie becomes bland and predictable. For such a star studded cast I expected more. Dark Water is an anchor of a movie. It falls in, sinks, drags, and then finally pulls to a stop. Hollywood complains about lack of interest in theatres; this is why. I am just glad I had a gift certificate and did not spend any money on this.Skip this and see war of the worlds!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dark Water Touchstone 2005 Color 116 minutes Horror-Drama Jennifer Connely, Tim Roth, Doughray Scott and John C. Reily star. Directed by John Sayles Rated PG-13 for adult themes and language. OK so no one will walk out of Dark water complaining that the film was loaded with a bunch of cheap jolts, cause there weren't any jolts at all. I can definitely have respect for a film thats willing to take the slow suspense drenched approach to terror. But if there is no suspense or delivery the wait is just not worth it. Connely gives it her best as a young mother whose in a horrid custody battle with her supposed cheating ex husband. Trying to find a new place to live she decides on a rundown apt building with a knack for dark corridors and even darker water from faucets, washing machines and ceilings. I'm not sure how long the film takes over in and i don't really care top be honest but eventually she realizes that the spirit of a young girl is stalking her family. Being a fan of the superior and wonderful original Japanese film. I felt especially cheated walking out of this redo. Besides not offering much of anything new and what was new was convoluted, silly or just plain questionable the film also did own up to the originals powerhouse scenes or the tear inducing and nightmarish finale. And I must tell you it's kinda hard for me to dislike a film. I enjoyed The ring remakes and The grudge immensely but this movie just turned me sour. It's dull, drab and excuse my language just plain boring. The film does little in the way of building suspense, a coherent story or even developing its characters. Connely and the rest of the staff do their best with the material but the film is just directed all wrong. It wants to be a classic ghost story. And it's true in most cases that less is more. However this film has less than the original and there wasn't much to begin with. Especially the laughable dark water drenched finale that completely was out of place. All in all I say go out and rent the original or just buy it. there's no need to waste your money of this diluted version. C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a decent thriller but Jennifer Connelly deserves better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about "Dark Water," I have to admit right from the start I wanted to see it. The trailer looked suspenseful and the film starred Jennifer Connelly and John C. Riley, both of which are terrific. So last night I decided to check out the reviews for it and to my surprise they were pretty average. But I figured what the heck; I'll give it a shot and make my own judgment about the flick."Dark Water" is a suspense thriller. The movie starts off by showing a mother Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) and her daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade) as they struggle through a divorce and move into a new apartment in Staten Island. Once they move into the new apartment, they notice there is a weird leak coming from the ceiling in Ceci's bedroom. They call the buildings supervisor Veeck (Peter Postlethwaite) who keeps fixing the leak but it never seems to be fixed. This is where the mystery begins as it seems like someone still lives in the apartment above where the water is leaking from.Right off the bat, I have to say without Jennifer Connelly, this film would have really sucked. Jennifer Connelly proves in this film that no matter how unoriginal something is that she can add something new to it as well as provide a believable and powerful performance. That being said, this movie is not very original nor is the plot unpredictable (I figured the entire film out in the first 15 minutes), in fact the movie is pretty much a clone of "The Ring Two" but this time is actually done right. I don't know if I wrote a review for "The Ring Two" but I hated it; the movie had poor acting, a lame story, and was boring as all hell. However, this is where "Dark Water" succeeds; And as I just mentioned Jennifer Connelly saves the film with her performance and brings suspense to the film. I actually believed that she was really worried about her daughter and I wanted to know what was happening in that apartment something that "The Ring Two" didn't do. I also have to mention that her daughter in the film Ceci played by Ariel Gade was also very good and believable. John C Riley was decent as well as the slimy building owner but he wasn't a big part of the film.Another thing I can really appreciate about the film is that it's a grown up movie. It takes its time to build suspense and does it well. I noticed a lot of little teenagers coming out of the movie saying it sucked. Granted the film wasn't great but it was a decent horror/suspense thriller. It's an adult movie, no typical boos and girls half dressed running down the hallway here. I can understand why the typical target audience for a film like this will not enjoy it but I personally am actual grateful for that.My complaint about this movie is this, I saw it before and I saw it again and I am really tired of the same storyline. I have begun to notice that every movie created by the author of "The Ring" concludes the same way. He really must love movies about scary kids and water, however it's really getting old fast. But I can safely say this film is the best of all films like this that follow the same story.So to wrap everything up, if you want a fresh and original movie then your not going to get it when you see "Dark Water", however, if want to see a suspense thriller that actually contains suspense and good performances then you might want to check this film out. On the whole, it's a pretty average movie but Jennifer Connelly really saves the flick. This is why I say she deserves better. The woman is a great actress and I would think after doing something like "A Beautiful Mind" and "House of Sand and Fog" she would stay on the Oscar worthy path. This movie is a little step back for her but she still manages to come out swinging. So in the end the performances and the suspense make up for the average "I already saw this movie" script.MovieManMenzel's final rating for "Dark Water" is a 6/10. It's a decent thriller to check out at the matinée or on Video or DVD but not worth the full price at the local multiplex.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) is going through a bit of a rough patch. She recently split with her cheating husband (Dougray Scott) and is on the verge of a nasty custody battle over her 5-year-old daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade). But first things first, a new place to live. After a bit of searching see finds an affordable place on Roosevelt Island. As they would say in the business the building a real "fixer-upper". From the get-go odd things start up. Water seems to appear everywhere but worst of all there's a steady leak from the apartment above her. Deadbeat landlords and her husband's actions drive her to doubt her sanity as things get more and more sinister. What does 10F above hiding and how does it tie in to her daughter's newfound imaginary friend."Dark Water" is another Americanized-remake of an Asian film. This time around the 2002 Japanese Hideo (Ringu) Nakata thriller is chosen. But thankfully this is a really solid effort by a fairly new director with no experience in the thriller zone. The film moves at a steady but leisurely pace setting up an uncomfortably and uneasy atmosphere that draws most of it's' terror from the stuff of parental nightmares. The acting is excellent all the way around with solid performances from the lesser parts (Tim Roth, Pete Postlewaite and John C. Reilly). But Connelly (as stunning as ever) and Gade do smash ?up jobs as the leads and Connelly is very believable as the mother-in-jeopardy. Some will unfairly compare "Dark Water" to "The Sixth Sense", which to be fair does bare some resemblance to it but not overtly. This flick builds its' suspense on emotion and paranoia, not cheap "boo" scares. If you are tired of "fast-food" and "cookie-cutter" teen terror (which there's nothing wrong with) give "Dark Water" a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have long been angered by films who pass themselves off as one thing in their advertising, and upon seeing the film it's something completely different. Dark Water is one of those films. Dark Water claims to be a horror/supernatural thriller with ghostly over tones. In actuality, it's a long, boring, painfully unexciting story of a ghost who isn't in the least menacing or unfortunately interesting. Dark Water is NOT a horror film. Dark Water is definitely NOT a supernatural thriller. In fact the only thrill i had while in the theater was when the end credits started to roll. The acting in the film is solid, but with precious little to do the actors seem bored, mirroring the reaction of the audience no doubt. The direction is plodding at best, trading long bits of of silence for any actual plot furthering information. I felt no connection to the characters, therefore i didn't care what happened to them. The bright spots were few, a wasted role for Tim Roth a brilliant actor who was woefully misused in a small forgettable part as Connely's lawyer. John Reilly was fantastic as usual, but he also had very little to do. The films pacing was also horrible, it was over two hours long, but i swear i felt like i was watching a nine hour documentary on how not to make a horror film. I must however thank the makers of Dark Water for one thing. Now when i see a bad film i can say, "That was bad, but it wasn't half as bad as Dark Water." Dark Water: The benchmark to which all other awful films will be compared.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie smelled like Dark Water.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't even know how to begin to express my disappointment with this movie. To simply call it bad would be insulting to things that are merely bad. As promised, it was a dark and brooding tale, laced with suspense, but the suspense doesn't seem to lead anywhere. I kept hoping that it would get better, but alas, the good moments in the film were very few and far between. John C. Reilly portrayed the scuzzy landlord beautifully, and Pete Postlethwaite was excellent as the grumpy building super. Both are almost caricatures of the characters they portray, but the moments when they are on screen together are some of the best in the entire movie. Tim Roth also did a wonderful job as Jennifer Connely's shyster lawyer. Unfortunately, he didn't seem to get enough screen time to fully develop his character and his somewhat quirky mannerisms. Other than those three, there weren't many redeeming moments.*****SPOILER ALERT***** If The Ring was based on the Japanese film, Ringu, then this movie was based on the film that ripped off Ringu. The big gotcha moment? There's a body of a dead girl in a water tank! Sound familiar? But wait! There's more! You'd think that the troubles of the poor single mom who stumbles into this nightmare would be over when she discovers the body, wouldn't you? No, they still have another little "twist" for you. I won't totally spoil it for anybody that wants to waste their time and/or money on this movie, I'll just say this: If you want to see a beautifully made suspense film, watch The Birds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can you say about a movie that has a strong premise but nothing else? The script is weak as weak can get. There is an idea, that's it. Beyond that the movie offers nothing. One cannot make a movie simply on an Idea? Well this is one of those types. Please save your money! Don't tell later that you were not warned. The film just 'wanders' around and if you have seen The Ring then you have seen it all. This film offers nothing more... so if you are entering the cinema hall saying: "This has to be better than ring", then you will be in for the greatest disappointment. The characters are as stale as the Dark Water. The film is a nest of clichés. The 'friend' of the child, the hallucinating adult who has a disturbed past. And what a past: an alcoholic/drug abuse mother, an unseen father. Wonder how the producers accepted to make such a film. It should have been rejected as a script. The poor actors what can they do when they are 'dumped' in the middle of a dead pan story. This is not a horror film this is a tragedy for the viewer. You can rent the DVD when its out, and believe me it will be out sooner than you know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it could have been worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a scary movie, it was not scary. For a psycho thriller it was not smart enough, or in depth enough to give you a thrill. Though for a ghost film it did do things differently.It could have been worse, it could have been a whole lot better, but it could have been worse. The point of the movie seemed clear until the end, and the mystery was revealed in the first 5 minutes. The little girls in the film all look so much alike that at times it is hard to tell who is who. But other than that it did have an interesting twist. Not interesting in a good way unfortunately. But the idea could be used by someone who can write a better screenplay, or someone who could direct a better film, to make a good flick.thats my $.02</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Nothing leaves a film-goer feeling less satisfied than a non-thrilling thriller. Based on a novel by Koji Suzuki ("The Ring"), director Walter Salles ("High Art") hands us a flat, uninspired, at times boring rendition of the traditional Hollywood genre.Despite a nice cast and excellent performances by Jennifer Connelly (looking unhealthily thin), John C. Riley, Tim Roth and especially Pete Postlehwaite, this movie provides only a couple of decent moments. The "good" moments are furnished by Perla Haney-Jardine ("Kill Bill" fans will recognize her as B.B. Kiddo) but there are not enough to save the film. The dark water is of course a major player and the convoluted attempts to mislead the viewer are weak and ineffective.This is just not a very good film and certainly not much of a thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alright thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I would not class this as a horror film as it has been advertised, it is more of a chilling thriller.The actors and actresses do a great job, but an absolutely excellent performance by the little girl - Ceci. What a wonderful little actress she is, she nailed every scene. And she is adorable. Being a single parent to a little girl, I related to this movie, the position Dahlia is put into and the struggles she comes across. However my life has never taken a sinister twist like hers.The ending was bittersweet and eerie. The creepiest part of the film is the little girl called Natasha. Who also did a great job as being the creepy little girl.I rooted for Dahlia all the way through, she was wronged many times and accused of absurd things, she was a wonderful mother - proved by the ending.I would recommend this film. I can't say that I would watch it myself again though.</fullReview>

In the end she sacrifices herself for her daughter's survival.The acting and production is excellent, but the story not so good. Cast in another light, the father would be a sympathetic character - but he appears aggressive when he's the real force for good.The writer probably transferred this good onto the divorce lawyer, and tried to embody the horror in a murdered girl. But it doesn't work - lots of "dark water", but no horror, no honesty.And what a waste of Pete Postlethwaite! Plus John Reilly. Great actors, but they didn't need to be there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails To Deliver As A Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dark Water is a remake of the Japanese film of the same title. that is based on the short story Floating Water from the horror anthology Honogurai mizu no soko kara by Koji Suzuki.It features Jennifer Connelly and Tim Roth. John C. Reilly, Pete Postlethwaite, Perla Haney-Jardine and Ariel Gade co-star to play key supporting roles.Directed by Walter Salles Jr., this remake of Hideo Nakata's supernatural psychological drama revolves around the plight of a single mother whose messy divorce and subsequent battle for the custody of her five-year-old daughter is taking a heavy toll on her emotional well- being. Ultimately, the mother and daughter are able to relocate to an apartment, which, despite its excessively dilapidated interior, seems to be an adequate location for beginning a new life. Before long, however, what appears to be the spirit of a young girl begins to haunt them. No stranger to mental illness, the wary young woman brushes the visions aside as part of the inherent stress of making the transition from housewife to working, single mom. As time goes by and the apparent haunting does not subside, the apartment's new residents are forced to examine the history of its former tenants.In many ways Dark Water improves upon the memorable original film that it's based on. In the hands of director Walter Salles and screenwriter Rafael Yglesias, the story gets an intelligent and more chillingly effective overhaul.But unfortunately,it fails as a horror film as it can't make up for the lack of genuine scares.Also, the familiar elements of the story disappoint despite having more substance and a more interesting look than many horror films.Overall,it does not work what it intends to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a twin sibling of the Ring....and that ain't so good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dark Water is just one of a number of remakes from Japanese b-movies. Among the other members of this family are The Grudge, Pulse, and The Ring, plus their sequels. Dark Water has much in common with the Ring, and aside from the character names, I find the two movies almost interchangeable, equally spooky and equally sloppy in climax. Part way through Dark Water, I would have said that this was the superior movie, but it falls apart pretty quickly, and in the end, it acts as just another reminder that the world could use something a little more creative and original.Dahlia William's and her husband are under going a divorce. As usual, the mother gets custody of the kids in this case their daughter. Her husband plans to sue, but in the meantime, Dahlia and her daughter move to Rosevelt Island and into a lousy little apartment, but one that is conveniently close to a new school. Before the two have time to settle in to the new place, trouble starts to emerge. First, black water starts leaking from the ceiling, and the janitor's attempts to fix it prove futile. Next, Sissy finds an imaginary friend who she calls Natasha. That happens to be the same name of the girl who lived in the room above, until the family disappeared a few weeks earlier. Or did they? Is Natasha still around? and why is she causing mischief for her neighbours below, or is this all just a state of mind?For a good while, Dark Water keeps you eager and engaged. A lot of things are going on, although some of them are not fully explained in the end. The film presents a handful of characters and has us guessing which one is responsible for the oddities which are happening to Dahlia's room. Unfortunately, when the movie reaches the point where everything gets explained, it all comes out in a clumsy and cheap manner. This happens incidentally in The Ring as well, and neither film even attempts to offer anything in the way of a riveting climax.Jennifer Connelly gives a fair performance despite having little to do, and the child playing Sissy is very convincing. The camera work is admirable given the context of the story, and keeps things tight on the subject matter, never getting too reckless or abstract. This is all good, but it doesn't save the movie. I guess the only reason to watch Dark Water is if you are nuts about the Ring, but I personally am not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A boring but somewhat realistic style of a ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the most boring supernatural movies I have ever seen. It's just really really slow with the build up and when it comes to the climax, it isn't even scary. For a supernatural movie they tried to go with the build up direction with hardly any supernatural things happening except for maybe 5 minutes. The story is about Dahlia trying to find a affordable place to live with her daughter after the divorce, even if the apartment is a mess with stuff dripping and oozing out of the ceilings. And later her daughter starts to talk to ghosts and weird stuff begins to happen. It's just a unsatisfying and boring ghost story, it's just dry even if it has water dripping in a lot of scenes and wasn't gripping. I will however say the atmosphere and the cinematography makes it sort of creepy, even if nothing of it was suspenseful like some people are claiming it to be. There were some Japanese people in the theater and they claimed to be horror fans of this kind of genre, but even they seemed a bit bored and unsatisfied. I can't believe I am saying this, but this film really turned me off from seeing the original. I will give credit to it being a sort of realistic and believable approach to a ghost story.3.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror retooled as drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the midst of a bitter divorce &amp; custody battle for her six-year-old daughter, Dahlia Williams moves into a rundown (but cheap) apartment on New York's Roosevelt Island. But with her new home comes new problems, first a wet patch on her ceiling, the building super who ignores her, a pair of creepy teenagers &amp; a child's "Hello Kitty" bag that keeps reappearing, even after being thrown in the trash. At first Dahlia believes that her husband is trying to drive her crazy but as time progresses realizes that the building is haunted by the ghost of a child who was abandoned by her parents.With the success of the Japanese horror film RING, the Japanese horror genre has become all the rage in the Western world, as well as inspiring a rash of remakes of Asian horror films such as THE RING, THE GRUDGE, THE EYE &amp; so on.I must admit to being one of the very few people who think that this craze is overrated. Sure, it's good to have interest in films made by other cultures, but some of these films, in particular RING, are not exactly good horror films.With the exception of THE RING, all the remakes are worse than their originals (okay, so THE GRUDGE was not too bad?). "Dark Water", based on the original film, which in turn was based on a novel (written by the same guy who wrote the novel which became RING) is perhaps the worst of this current trend, which is a shame since it actually improves upon the original in some respects.The original film, for most of its running time, was based upon the life of a recently divorced mother who was going through a particularly messy divorce, fighting for custody of her daughter from her chain-smoking, dirty dealing husband, with no actual horror elements save for a growing patch of water coming from her ceiling &amp; the ghostly appearances of a red child's school bag (known as "Mimiko" syndrome). Having seen the first film before the remake, I was expecting Hollywood to top this. I was only half right."Dark Water" follows the original's story very closely but translates it to be understood by American audiences. The film is set in Roosevelt Island, a small island close to Manhattan which, with its bad weather &amp; small town feel, is suitably depressing &amp; fits the mood perfectly. Let me point out that the apartment, in fact the whole building looks almost exactly like the one in the original (I was having déj? vu when watching this). The USA is notorious for having practically rundown el cheapo apartments &amp; houses so the story fits in with American audiences better than the first film did with the Japanese. The building's owners are just as bad, John C. Reilly's role as the landlord who is quite slimy but likable &amp; the super (who in the original was incompetent) is a nasty piece of work, avoiding fixing problems &amp; not caring about anyone, which will get him into trouble with the law later on. The other main improvement is the fact that we get into Jennifer Connelly's head &amp; mental state better than we did with the woman in the original. Here we keep asking ourselves whether she is imagining things or else. Tim Roth shines in his role as the good-guy lawyer who actually takes care of the problem, taking the super to task over his handling of the situation.That said, the film fails in its most important task. The director hates horror films &amp; as such actually tried to retool the film as a drama. It doesn't work. Most of the film's running time, the filmmakers forget that they are making a horror film, &amp; when they do cotton on, quickly attempt to manipulate the audience by using sound effects (on the DVD the sound designers talk about how the viewer needs sound effects in order to feel the right way. I say to those people to stop this because not every film-goer is an idiot). I won't talk about the ending in order to prevent spoiling it for those who haven't seen it, but will add that it fails to clear things up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Japanese Horror Remakes... from this author it seems they've made at least two movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now having seen both The Ring and Dark Water, I'm beginning to wonder if the directors are completely misrepresenting the novels that the movies were based on, resulting in similar movies from the same kinds of books, or if there have been multiple movies made from one book.The similarities between these two movies are the characters, in basic. Distressed mother with young child, generally absent father. What seems to be is Samara (from The Ring) is Jennifer Connelly's (the dark-haired Naomi Watts) daughter. The same dirty brown on the walls (the leak in the ceiling, the tree in Samara's bedroom in the barn), the little girl's singing (Ceci in her bed under the leak, Samara by the well she drowned in), the occurrences of drowning little girls (Natasha on the roof, Samara in the well) being discovered by thin and gorgeous young mothers, the child being "controlled" while drawing at school (Aidan's large dark circles, Ceci's painting), water and hair appearances (overall theme for Dark Water was water, the characters all had dark hair, then some black hair comes out of the sink faucet while Dahlia pops another pill; Anna Morgan and Samara's black hair, also with many occurrences of water, e.g., the well), the mother abandoning her daughter (Dahlia being abandoned by her mother, Ceci abandoned by hers, Samara's mother who killed herself), and the general living environment of cities where it rains a lot.There were some successful suspense techniques, but those also worked on me in The Ring. The acting was good, or I may just be fans of the actors. If you've seen The Ring and Dark Water then you've seen all that comes from this author.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>but just doesn't pull it off. This movie uses gloomy weather and a dark background to try to be scary. While adding to the creepiness of it, the use of rain doesn't make up for the lacking of story. The movie could have also used a little more startling jumps. A lady moves into an apartment with her daughter. There is a nasty leak in the ceiling. She goes in the apartment upstairs to find it flooded with black water. Perhaps she should have realized something was up then, but she continues to live in the apartment. Cici, the daughter, starts having an imaginary friend, named Natasha. She learns there was a Natasha who lived upstairs who was abandoned by her parents. More creepy things happen, yet the woman never says she's seeing a ghost. I won't give away the surprise ending.FINAL VERICT: This was OK, not great. If you like creepy movies, then check it out. I just didn't think it was the most suspenseful film out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films that you feel is taking forever to get to the point. Unfortunately a worthwhile point for the film is never actually achieved. It's full of dead ends and red herrings on the way down the clogged drain. The only reason I give it a 3 is because the acting was okay.There were a few potentially interesting elements introduced to the film that never go anywhere. Like the story behind the lawyer who works out of his car and pretends to have a family and office or why WAS the husband talking to the juvenile delinquents behind his ex's back? Another thing that bothered me, why did they have to make the little girl's ghost a killer instead of a sympathetic character in need of love as she had been till the ending. Given all the poor kid had gone through before she died it seemed callous to make her a selfish killer ? I notice many comments here seem to see something "deeper" (no pun intended) in this film. Like a single mother's sacrifices for her child and all that. Frankly that's just wishful thinking, hoping that the glass is half full of dark water and not just half empty (pun intended that time). Instead the glass is bone dry IMO. And I'm not some teenager who expects nothing but action from a film and doesn't want to think. That is what one person's comments here said about those who didn't like the film "They must be teenagers". I've been around awhile (nevermind my age) and know the difference between a film with something to say and one that goes nowhere very very slowly.When this turkey finally does finish you will most likely feel all wet, cheated and in need of a dry towel like I did by the stupid ending.</fullReview>

Where the original was absolutely interesting in it's quiet execution, this one is just boring. If you've seen the original, you have no reason to sit down with this one. Nothing new is offered and important scenes are omitted. The eeriness and building dread are just not present. Salles has created a good atmosphere, but he does nothing with it. What's really sad is this is the most impressive and talented cast to be featured in a horror film in ages. The incredible Jennifer Connelly, Pete Postlethwaite, Dougray Scott, Tim Roth, and John C.

		<shortDescription>Decent story but........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the story here but the overall way it was done was not very good. Some of the scenes were done very well and you can most certainly see the producers previous work in it. But scenes like the one towards the end, in the bathroom, was laughable. When the mother in sitting on the sofa with who she thinks is her daughter, who turns out to be Natasha, when she goes into the bathroom to find Natasha trying to drown her daughter behind a locked shower door, this scene actually had me laughing. I mean to this point the scenes had been done so that you could see them happening. But come on!!! Anyone who saw this, could you believe the torrents of water coming from the walls and sink?! To me, it was silly. ANd then to have the mother die so she could fulfill the promise of being the little girl from upstairs mother? Nah, I didn't buy it.And what was with the maintenance guy? Was he involved? They touch on him maybe knowing something but never go back to finish it. Also, what was with the lawyer taking pictures with his cell-phone camera? What was the purpose of that?In my opinion, there were too many unfinished thoughts in this movie. Too many strings left untied. The movie does a good job of building some tension in the first half, but I felt that the second half, instead of solving things only creates more questions. Questions that NEVER get answered. Like the relationship with Jennifer's mother, it just doesn't ever get made clear. In my imagination, I can put it all together after some thought, but only after trying to piece it all together.I gave this movie a 4 of 10. Those 4 points were alone for Jennifer Conelly's acting. She did very well and DOES do well in these kinds of tension filled movies. ( Requiem For a Dream, is one example.) Other-than-that the movie falls flat on it's face. It builds tension and asks question without ever really getting to the point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have said it before, and I will say it again: Jennifer Connelly is the greatest actress in all of human history in every possible dimension. She is joined by John C. Reilly who is excellent, and Tim Roth, who is one of the best character actors in movie history (and to be honest his character acting is so fine I didn't even recognize him under that beard). Mix this with a perfect sound team and a scenery team that my friend Hannah says made the apartment complex look like a concentration camp.Yet, despite all this, this is one of the worst horror films you will ever see. The suspense is there, but with absolutely no payoff. Boring! The plot is a mother and daughter who move into a new apartment, and the rook leaks. The daughter begins talking to an imaginary friend, and other strange things happen. But this main plot is boring. The more interesting elements are largely ignored -- why does the lawyer have no family? Who is the man in his back seat? Is the husband connected to the kids? What nationality is Mr. Veck? Who is on the other end of the phone? The main plot was so slow and predictable, and the ending so flat and frustrating. Any of these side plots could have made a more entertaining film.Don't be suckered in my the excellent cast. Somehow somebody found a way to give the best people in Hollywood the worst script possible. Not recommended. Ever. To anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It may just be that, as an American, I have been brought up with a different sense of the mysterious. This movie is Americanized, we are told, but based on a Japanese story. It is set in the greater New York City area, but involves Japanese style haunting. I didn't find it particularly scary, and I din't find the story particularly interesting. Too much of it was just ugly, with dark water coming out of faucets and bad water leaks recurring. Still, Jennifer Connelly is a fine and beautiful actress actress and I enjoyed her role.Jennifer Connelly plays Dahlia, mother of a young daughter who needs an affordable place to live as she and her husband (Dougray Scott) are splitting up. An interesting aspect which didn't necessarily fit the rest of the story, it appeared that people routinely lied to her. As she was looking at the apartment the leasing agent (John C. Reilly) kept telling her that another couple was due any minute to look at the apartment, as a ruse to lease it quickly, which worked. Later, the lawyer she hired (Tim Roth) said things on the phone like, "I am with my family right now", when in reality he was watching a movie in an almost empty theater.Another bright spot was little Ariel Gade who played the daughter, Ceci. She is cute as a button, and a fine young actress.MAJOR SPOILERS. There is a bad leak in the corner of the ceiling of the new apartment. The apartment upstairs is vacant, but daughter Ceci says she has a new friend, Natasha, whom no one else can see. It turns out that little Natasha was the daughter upstairs, mom and/or dad drowned her in the water cistern on top of the building (Dahlia eventually found her) and her ghost was still hanging around, and little Ceci could see her. The dead girl wanted a mother who would stay with her and at the end, using dark water to its full force, drowns Dahlia so that both of their ghosts could stay together, the little girl had a mother again, and little Ceci went with dad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(SOME SPOILERS) The psychological impact of being abandoned as a young girl by her mother has left deep scares on Dahlia, Jennifer Connelly. Now involved in a bitter custody battle with her ex-husband Kyle, Dougary Scott, the last thing she wants is that her young daughter Ceci, Rael Gader, would end up the same way.Moving into a high-rise apartment at New York's Roosevelt Island Dahlia at first feels that everything will go well for her and Ceci. With an excellent school just two blocks away and her getting a job as a copy editor just across the East River to support both her and her daughter Dahlia couldn't have been more mistaken.At first Ceci didn't like to move into the dark and spooky apartment building, it's yucky she kept telling her mom, but almost at once she started to like being there. It turned out that Ceci found a friend in the building a little girl, who's been abandoned by her parents just like her mother was, but that only she can see hear and talk to.The movie "Dark Water" is a combination ghost story and psychological thriller with Dahlia losing control of her senses as she gets engulfed in a room full of water. Water from at first the upper empty apartment and then from all the pipes and water faucets in her own. Ceci's friend Natasha, Perla Heney-Jardine, turns out to be a little girl who lived upstairs with her parents who separated, just like her own, and was abandoned, like her mother Dahlia, and never found. With the water leak upstairs driving Dahlia off her rocker she asks the super Mr. Veek, Pete Poshethwait, to patch it up. Veek seems a bit annoyed with her request telling Dehlia to get herself a plumber to do the patch-job instead. Veek is also very nasty to Ceci who called him a liar for telling her that this doll that she found in the building, ,that once belonged to Natasha, that he promised to give her was picked up by the Little girl who lost it! It turns out that Ceci was right on both counts Veek was lying and the doll was Natasha's.With Dahlia starting to think that because of her failing mental condition she'd lose custody of Ceci she gets in touch with attorney Jeff Platzer, Tim Roth. Dahlia wants to find out if it's her ex-husband, Kyle, who's behind all this mental torture she's been going through in order for him to get Ceci away from her through the courts.Platzer, like everyone else in the film, begins to realize that Dahlia is losing her mind. Platzer completely overlooks the fact that little Natasha may well be somewhere in the building, and indeed communicating with Ceci. Since both of Natasha's parents mistakenly thought that the other had her with them after they split from the apartment house and went their separate ways.The shocking ending to "Dark Water" has the truth about the mystery of Natasha and what she had to do with all the haunting, and water leaks, in the building. Dahlia is drawn to the roof and finds out what the super, Mr. Veek, had kept hidden from her all this time. What she finds out in he end drove poor Dahlia to her tragic and watery death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't compare..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biggest problem people get to do is compare, they will compare this film to the US version of "The grudge", "The Ring",... Or they will compare it to the Japanese version. Now my question is, what is the interest of doing that ? The answer : none.I saw the movie, and I enjoyed it, it wasn't one of the scariest films ever, but wonderful directed, the setting was amazing, the shoots were good and so were the actors. The tension was well build up, the draft was good, with the usual sub-plot on it to make the story move. And it leads us, to a great final showdown, which is actually the scene, when as a watcher you feel a lot of tension ! So in a few words : A good thriller/horror film that will provide some entertainment !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>more than just a horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The introductory scene in 'Dark Water' is located in Seattle, and nobody is amazed to see rain in a Seattle scene. Although the rest of the movie happens in New York, rain and other appearances of water are all over this film - water envelops everything and eventually kills.Director Walter Salles is at his first film in the US, he made at least two important South American movies before, and one may wonder why he picked such a movie for his North-American debut. 'Dark Water' belongs to a very well-defined genre, where audiences come with very clear expectations. Salles interest is not really in the horror and ghost story, he is taking the Japanese film (I did not see it) theme and turning it into a domestic drama that seems to turn into horror almost despite the director's wishes. Jennifer Connely is very good as the separated mother, with a history of herself, taking her young daughter (Ariel Grade who makes us forget Dakota) in a crippled and decomposing building in a otherwise average neighborhood. Actually so good is her act that we are soon more interested in the mother-daughter relationship, and in the parental abandon theme than in the accumulating menaces around. Good acting from John C. Reilly and Pete Postlethwaite paints some needed color spots in this gray drama, and eventually the story back is brought back to where the script and viewers expect, but it maybe happens a little too late for the horror movies fans.'Dar Water' is more than a horror movie, but here may lie the problem. I may have liked it more than people who bought the ticket or rented the DVD expecting a pure horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mother and her daughter settle at a creepy and less than impressive apartment after a divorce, only to find that there are strange goings on behind the scenes. With the daughter at first despising the place, the mother suspects something may be out of place when the child soon finds the place appealing following her meeting up with her imaginary friend. As the story unfolds an eerie side begins to get uncovered and soon we learn the dark past of the block.The movie is okay to pass the time, although it didn't have me at the edge of my seat if the truth be known. There was a good performance by Jennifer Connolly, but the child began to get on my nerves as the movie went on. There were some clever twists and turns and we learnt about the past of some of the occupants and the fact that a 'horror' can be created by a constant dripping of water that ultimately will send you crazy. Not good, but not bad either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i think this is a very good film. it is very well made and is very spooky and eerie. I think the actors gel well together, and each play they roles extremely convincingly and real. I think that it feels very real, is a very strong plus. The characters are very lifelike and portray emotion, and they're likes and dislikes to great resonance. each of the characters have their own distinct subtleties and characteristics. the main female character, played by jennifer connelly is really good. She shines in the film, with radiance, inner strength and honesty. She seems to be trying to do the wright thing in an environment that is mysterious and crumbling. I think Jennifer Connelly feels just right for the film. The story of the film is quite complex, and may require more than one viewing to fully grasp. However, the special effects and set designs are of the highest standards. The director and other members of the crew have done an amazing job of creating jennifer's world. But still manage to maintain a strong sense of reality.The sound effects are also very good. Really adding to the suspense and emotions of the film as it unfolds.This is a very good suspense thriller/horror film. I have not seen one like this before. Its quite original.</fullReview>

Especially the scenes in the bathrooms... they seemed filthy, fact freaky enough for my personality! Although I consider it to be a worthy to watch film there is no comparison that can be established between this ghost story and films like the Ring and Ju-On:The Grudge (the Japanese version!!!)

It reminded me so much of "The Ring" and "The Grudge" that I was not overly surprised by anything that happened. Don't get me wrong -- damp ghosts are the best kind in my opinion. The setting and the atmosphere were perfect. Sheesh, what a horrible place. But I felt I was seeing a lot of scare potential go to waste. I wanted to see much bigger things happen in the waterlogged apartment, for one thing. Most in-your-face ghostage. I wanted to see certain parties get it, but good, and I was disappointed. I wanted to see a little tiny glimmer of beauty or good cheer SOMEWHERE in this movie to break up the depressing atmosphere and remind us that not everything in the world looked like Roosevelt Island.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good psychological drama, which never quite realizes on its potential to be suspenseful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Brazilian film maker, Walter Salles (The Motorcycle Diaries, Central Station) and starring Jennifer Connelly, Dougray Scott, Pete Postlewaite, Tim Roth and John C. Reilly. Once again the marketing people bill the film as being a horror, when at best it is a mysterious, dark, brooding psychological thriller. The movie presents Connelly as a struggling, recently separated mother. She wants the best education for her daughter within given constraints and, moves into an apartment building on Roosevelt Island, which is in close proximity to a good school. She quickly grabs apartment 9F, after a great sleazy hustle by John C. Reilly (the manager of the building). The building's exterior holds nothing to the damp, mossy-looking, creaky internal infrastructure. Almost immediately the building's character creeps the viewer out. Salles and team obviously take great pride in infusing the atmosphere with minute details (even a questionable superintendent). Connelly's character holds some deep-rooted anxieties though, which are exacerbated by the challenges she faces with a leaking apartment, strange on-goings in the upstairs apartment, the bitter custody battle and a boring job. She is on screen for over 90% of the time and is magnificent, reaching great depth in getting the film's audience to see things through her eyes. Each character also bears secrets, which contributes to the drama. That Connelly succeeds so well in doing this, is to both her and Salles credit, because the psychological meter on the film kicks into high gear, befitting fans of Hitchcock and other suspense greats. Salles pacing of the movie works to have the audience soak up the ambiance. However, it is also the movie's greatest failing. I am certain that he knows how to scare his audience and everyone expects it, however this jolt never comes. At some point in the movie, the build up of suspense stops all together, without ever reaching a peak. The sub-plot takes the now typical Hideo Nakata (The Ring) story arch and that feeling of betrayal sets in. Remarkably, this film is positioned within a summer-fare of action and comedy. While a good drama, the level of suspense never realizes on its potential. The movie is slow and all about mood. Viewing is only recommended if you are a fan of stylized film making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see why some didn't like this. Different to the original and I preferred the original but still this is a very good movie in its own right with the two parents and two child actors doing a great job, let down surprisingly by Pete Poselwaite as a janitor who was given too much time on screen.Creepy and jumpy at many points as it follows the struggles of a woman bringing up her child whilst in the middle of a divorce and is haunted by her own upbringing by her mother. For people who haven't seen the original this is a must. Intelligent and original for horror, but if you prefer Freddy movies then this is not for you. For the rest of us, this is a very good movie which will leave you thinking about it for time to come. I've seen the original a couple of times now and this fairly compliments it.

Quite like The Ring, it had some depth, but majorly lacks originality, especially since it came out after The Ring.I had been waiting to see this movie for several months, when I saw it first advertised, and I got half of what I was looking for in the movie. It did put me on edge for a while, and Jennifer Connily did play a great part. But, again, it does lack originality, and didn't have the most frightening storyline. What is it that the author, Koji Suzuki, has with little girls pretty much being drowned in a well type area by their mothers, and then attacking little boys or girls to steal their mother?

Ghost comes back, kills mom, nice ending. DUH! Two good things. First: they play around with the "insane mother" thing for a while, enough to make you wonder "is it all in her head?", but they keep her credibility standing instead of making another "crazy mother sees ghost and: option a) it's all in her head; option b) the ghost is real" movie.

		<shortDescription>Acting wins out over special effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What distinguishes Dark Water from so many of its current Hollywood contemporaries is the shunning of special effects in favour of acting. An old fashioned notion, but one that pays off since you really get into the characters in the film and care about what happens about them. The performances are uniformly excellent, from Pete Pothelswaite's seedy janitor to Jennifer Connelly's lead role. The tension builds up slowly and there are deft touches, such as the lawyer's pretence of a family while watching a movie alone. I just wish there were more films like this these days. It is so tempting for a director to use CGI effects to conjure up scary moments, when this film proves that what is needed is a good script and fine performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie with a great cast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a somewhat different take from Mr. Ferguson's. I think it deserves a solid "B" grade, for Good. Not Excellent, but not lousy, either. The performances by Jennifer Connelly, John C. Riley, Tim Roth and Pete Postlethwaite were, as mentioned, excellent, as you'd expect from such fine actors. What Mr. Salles does is to present us, through those wonderful actors, ordinary people in the kind of jaw grinding realities we all (most of us, anyway) have been through, and, in the midst of that to gradually bring in the Disturbing. He doesn't smash us over the head with it?no fiendishly grinning heads turning 360 degrees accompanied by choirs of howling demons. No. Dark water and creepy whispers, and a hint of past foul play of the type we know means ghosts may lurk here.I think it is precisely because of the equality with which Salles presents both the everyday and the creepy that the creepy is given a kind of credibility different from the usual kind in horror flicks. In an Exorcist type movie, for example (to continue the comparison), when the ordinary ends and the Spooky starts we voluntarily suspend skepticism so that we can be supremely weirded out by the special effects. We don't have to voluntarily do anything here. There's no stepping out of the Ordinary into the Supernatural. By the ongoing merging of the ordinary and the creepy, we are lured into accepting the creepy?as it creeps in, as it were. By the insistence of Mr. Salles that we continue to empathize with Ms. Connelly's character by the everyday nature of the ongoing story, tension-filled as it is, throughout the movie, we then have to accept all that she experiences, as it is woven in at a level pretty commensurate with her real-life experiences?but then ratcheted up at key points. Of course, there's the brief reference to childhood abuses to cast just a bit of question as to whether what we are seeing is the product of an imbalanced mind. But even that plays out both at the level of the conflict-ridden divorce she's in (he would bring that up, wouldn't he) as well as the supernatural invasion she's experiencing. Again, the merging of the ordinary and the creepy.I just saw it with my 15 year old daughter. We both enjoyed it, and agreed it deserved a B. We didn't walk out of the theater ready to phone friends and relatives to urge them to see it. But we liked it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While a fan of J-Horror, Dark Water is a stagnant flick. Following the theme of Grudge and Ring of the mother/daughter parent/child old death haunts place / person / thing, Dark Water has potential. Beautifully shot, it puts dear old Roosevelt Island in a terribly dark vision as a crumbling, decrepit housing development filled with tired souls. Dahlia (Connelly) is a mother going through a divorce, still battling for custody of her only child Ceci. As Dahlia struggles with this ugly mess, she is faced with finding a new home, a new job, and a new life with her daughter. They move into an apartment on Roosevelt Island and soon discover that all is not right. As a spirit haunts the building, Dahlia's past begins to haunt her and she struggles to protect her child. The production value is high, but the scares are few and the screenplay should have been rewritten to make Dahlia a stronger character. The motivations of many of the other characters aren't clear, as they all seem to exist simply to make Dahlia's craziness more scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mama Connelly In Fine (And Wet) Form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Dark Water' is this year's version of 'The Forgotten'...only it's a better movie. Same premise, though. Beautiful (but emotionally damaged) mother tries desperately to protect her only child from supernatural forces. The perpetually grim Jennifer Connelly plays Dahlia Williams, a recently separated mother of the adorable Ceci (Ariel Gade). They move into a stinkhole apartment where grimy water leaks everywhere and a ghostly girl who once lived upstairs is playing mind games with our heroines. If screenwriter Rafael Yglesias' adaptation of the original Japanese film was sharper, 'Dark Water' could have been a big winner, rather than being just okay.The marketing department is misleading people by promoting this as a scary movie. It's not that at all. The drama comes from Dahlia's struggle with abandonment issues, which go all the way back to when her parents (especially her alcoholic mama) left her for the hounds. Dahlia's ex (Dougray Scott) doesn't trust his daughter with such an unbalanced mother and that apartment looks like a shabbier place to live all the time. What makes this movie effective is that director Walter Salles doesn't resort to shock tactics. He plays up the claustrophobia &amp; the dank of the apartment and avoids cheapo scream-inducers.Connelly's characters don't usually have much joy in life, but she's as good as she's ever been in the early "loving mother, adoring daughter" scenes with Gade. John C. Reilly delightfully upstages everybody as the crummy building's real estate huckster, though. Tim Roth is Connelly's lawyer and he's both a con artist and a decent human being. This is a woman's picture, though, and the sopping climax is all about a mother's overpowering love for her kid. 'Dark Water' has no scares, but the respectable drama is mostly redeemed by the terrific cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the Japanese version is very good and scary as well, the American version is quite different. The movie was adapted into a dramatic film with more of a focus on the mother instead of her daughter. Also, the ghost in this film does not really "haunt" in the traditional sense of haunting. If you like Jennifer Connelley, I recommend it. However, I like Jennifer Connelley and I was still a little bit disappointed by this film. It may be a good "renting" movie since it has an interesting story and has excellent acting from everyone in the film, but no more. Just keep in mind that it is more of a psychological drama. If you want to be scared and have a more exciting experience, see the original Japanese version. Or see The Ring again.I give this 3/5 for heartwarming story and great acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Layperson's Meaning of "Dark Water" and Why I Saw It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watch a movie, more than likely it is to be entertained. When I see movies with my best friend Stacie, I get after dinner conversations on the meaning of the movie's content. We saw this last night.I thought this was put together well. It kept me guessing on which male figure in the movie was to be the hero to get her out of this situation. (Tim Roth and Dougray Scott comes close where technically there is none.) And Chelsea gave me impressions Dakota Fanning of "Hide and Seek" without the dual personalities. It's sepia tonal cinematography and concurrent flashback/dream sequences serves as a reminder of once was, and that you should go forward with life and not dwell on the past.Stacie on the other hand comes to this conclusion: Girls need their mommies. She looked at this from the perspective of losing a parent and the effect of this on the child -- especially the abandonment issue of the ghost child. Children don't understand the consequences of their actions. Therefore, the ghost child's asking of Chelsea's mom to replace her mom while attempting to drown Chelsea was more of a plea for help than say selfishness. Although Chelsea was as bright as they come, I would think in Chelsea's future comes a lot of therapy because no child should have to go through this.Then again, I'm an ordinary guy, not a psychologist.</fullReview>

The cop's voice in the background says 'no apparent cause of death" - so was there a lot of water in the apartment or wasn't there? Did she drown? This story is so full of holes it manages to drown itself without a hint of a struggle. Most people, even desperate people, confronted with a situation like that would have moved out after a week. She had a job, she wasn't made out to be especially poverty-stricken. For both herself and her daughter (whom she loves enough to give her life for) she would have moved out. It's the cheaper, less painful option.Some dirty water shooting out toilets, a nasty stain on the ceiling and a cute kid staring at the camera saying "will you be my mommy" do not make a great horror movie on their own. There has to be a whole lot more.A very weak film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very atmospheric and does a great job of establishing a creepy, somber mood. Many characters seem to be interesting and unique at first (How about the oddball building handyman? Or the down-on-his-luck lawyer?). However, nothing develops from this. Two hours later you're left wondering what the point was. So don't be fooled.The "twist" at the end of the story is weak to say the least. It's your basic ghost/spirit story. All of the strange events have been caused by the ghost of a young girl who used to live upstairs. She drowned in the water tower on the roof of the building after her parents abandoned her. Yes, the spirit of the young girl communicates with water because she died by drowning. Big surprise. You have your standard creepy kid with an "imaginary" friend. Sigh. The main character has mental problems, so we're not sure how much of this is real. Seen that before too. How about a scene where something creepy happens in a bathtub? Sound original? Didn't think so.I suppose you could see the film as exploring the fragmentation of modern families to a certain extent. The aftermath of a broken family is a prominent theme. But any serious exploration down that path is upended by the laughably predictable supernatural element.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry to say but, American shouldn't do Japanese films remakes.America is not Japan, and anyway you take it, the ambiance and feel never be the same. I love the Japanese original. Frightening and spooky. This one is a "Wal Mart" version, with all angles softened. Just a movie. Not that it's bad. It's too clean and nice even if the screenplay is still the same.For example, the building where the women lives, is just ... a building. OK, not very engaging, but nothing more. The original building is completely sinister : dark and dirty, even though it's a common one. Almost alive.There's also these complex relationship between the Japanese culture and the water and the hair. Very important in this film context.This film is interesting to see anyway, but both culture don't mix, and something don't catch on this one. It will be disappointing if you already know the original. So take look at it, and then see the Japanese one.</fullReview>

They have a daughter named Cecilia Williams, (Ariel Gade) and there is a custody dispute between this couple and most of their troubles start when Dahlia moves to Roosevelt Island which can only be reached by a tram cable car from Manhattan. Dahlia moves into a run down apartment which is very depressing and a superintendent who looks like Count Dracula. The mother and daughter live in apartment 9F and all kinds of problems come from apartment 10F on the above floor. Ariel begins to have a very real invisible friend who tries to tell her about how she was left alone by her mother and father. This is a very creepy film with horrible living conditions and lots of crazy spirits wandering all around. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>psychological thriller... but not so thrilling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An interesting, potentially moving story that could have been better done. Somehow was rather limp, rather than taut with tension. Since I have had lots of problems with leaky apartments and uncooperative building supervisors, the characters' problems felt more like a renters' nightmare than anything - and weird noises and startling flashback images didn't add any creepiness, though they were clearly supposed to. I was vaguely reminded of The Tenant, but that film was WAAAAY creepier than this one. The nature of the ghost might throw some viewers, as it is from a Japanese novel and ghosts in Japan come from a different tradition than those in the West. Japanese ghosts are less impersonal and more like an evil spirit, taking an intense interest in a living person. But still, the ghost struck me as more a sad thing than a scary thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilly ghost story is ultimately a disappointment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DARK WATER is worth watching mainly for the performance of JENNIFER CONNOLLY as a distraught mother who almost has a nervous breakdown over the mysterious happenings in a run-down apartment she rents on Roosevelt Island in New York City. Indeed, the apartment is so intent on leaking "dark water" with ominous ceiling stains, you wonder how the woman didn't just move out when the hauntings began.A lot of common sense is missing in the screenplay, which starts out with the mother and father (DOUGRAY SCOTT) fighting over custody of their young daughter (ARIEL GADE), who, by the way, gives an excellent performance as the girl with an imaginary companion. Or so it seems, when the girl disrupts the classroom by arguing with her overbearing companion.But the ghost factor of the story is never clearly resolved and most of the attention is riveted because the atmosphere and the music seems to imply that something is about to happen. It rarely does, which is another weakness in the story--but when it does, it's not always credible.What the story does do is provide a good fifteen minutes toward the end which makes a rather satisfying conclusion as the mother confronts the ghost of a child that's been at the center of the haunting. To tell any more would be to give away the ending, but suffice it to say that here at least the script wraps up in an interesting way.JENNIFER CONNOLLY gives a very intense performance as the young mother, especially the scene where she has an emotional collapse. JOHN C. REILLY as a sleazy rental agent injects some much needed humor into his role and TIM ROTH is good as a concerned lawyer.Summing up: Some taut suspense and chills but ultimately somewhat of a letdown and lacking credibility. Would an intelligent woman really move into such a dank, dismal apartment so obviously badly in need of a good plumber? I know she was distracted and under a nervous strain, but give me a break!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dark Water is one of the most boring films I've ever seen. One of the worst of the year by far. The acting of Jennifer Connelly is horrible at best. The supporting characters were terrible too, even the usually brilliant Pete Postlewaite. The only strong performance is by the little girl, Ariel Gade. The script is pointless. It is more of a divorce film than anything, combined with the always clichéd thriller plots of "Is she crazy, or is it real?" and "Does the child really see something?". It never quite reaches suspense, or thrill, or even entertainment. If you are looking for Kramer vs Kramer, maybe this is your film. If you are looking for The Ring, or Hide and Seek, look elsewhere. Unless you are an incurable insomniac, badly in need of sleep, do not watch this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a real disappointment it was like a really bad and poorly made version of the ring. This movie is about a mother and daughter who move into an apartment and the ceiling starts to leak black water. They set you up for some thrills but they never deliver the thrills. This movie had a good idea but they forgot that half an hour in they don't want an idea they want a scary movie. Then they just drop the whole fact that it is supposed to be scary and start getting into the wives divorce with her husband. If they would finish the scenes that set you up for some thrills this would be a great movie. My final verdict for Dark Water is it's poorly made and the thrills never seem to come. Don't even rent it wait till it comes to T.V. I give it 2 stars out of 10 and no thumbs up.Rated PG-13 for Thematic Elements and some language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dark water is the tale of a woman and her daughter going through a divorce and having to make ends meet by living in a really crappy apartment. Weird stuff ensues.What a dreary, hokey, uncomfortable movie. There was no one I could associate with. I can't watch kids in bad situations. I wish people making movies would understand this rule: Little kids should not in put in dangerous situations. You can't have a horror flick with a 6 year old in danger. Now you might say "What about the Shining?". That worked because of too things. One he was older than six. And secondly (and more importantly) he had super natural powers. This sweet little girl was too sweet to be in the situation she was in. I didn't at all enjoy watch that. Nor the mothers situation either. Top that off with it raining in the movie from beginning to end didn't help. Everything was wet and cold. Maybe that was supposed to be "chilling" or "get under my skin". All it did for me was want the movie to end so I could go home and take care of my kids and get under the nice warm covers.2/10 (This is the lowest movie I've ranked this year so far).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit? I had very high expectations before seeing this movie considering that the Japanese version of this story is quite a disturbing flick. Beside, I liked both Ring and Ring2 so I was certain that this was my kind of movie? Now after seeing it I am a little bit confused. This was not Ring or Grudge. Instead, this movie reminded me more of Sixth Sense and The Others. It plays out more like psychological thriller instead of my expectation of a pure horror movie.So is Dark Water a good movie? Well, it is not bad but its problem is that it falls somewhere between thriller and horror genres, without being especially satisfying in any of these two areas. The story isn't sufficiently complex, engaging or interesting for it to be a good thriller. On the other hand, the chills and scares are too few so that movie never lives up to its horror image.Additionally, the child actress steals way too much of the film. Every five minutes or so, everyone in the theater was smiling and laughing because of another super-duper-sweet line from the little girl. This was extremely irritating and naturally does not contribute to this movie in the intended way.The good things here are in my opinion: the cast and the environment (nice rainy NY scenery).Score: 5 Molotov cocktails out of 10 available</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too bad this had to be a "horror flick..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's enough here to be of interest to succeed as a straight-up psychological thriller about a woman carrying too much baggage and trying to keep too many plates spinning at once. I probably would have liked it better without any ghosts at all, especially Japanese-inspired ghosts with a pronounced water fixation. (Well, it's a small country surrounded by lots of water with the occasional tsunami, so the hydrophilia/phobia is understandable.) This time around I was glad I haven't seen the original (being neither a resident of a big city nor an owner of a DVD player) and also that I haven't seen so much of Jennifer Connelly that I would feel the urge, a la TV's Richard Roeper, to suggest she needs to "lighten up." Does anyone tell Adam Sandler he needs to do Shakespeare? (I hope not.) Those who do something well should feel free to go on doing it; I'll happily pay to see it.Ms Connelly's character, we gather, has for much of her life been unhappy and/or wet. We meet her as a kid in Seattle waiting in the rain for her ne'er-do-well mother to pick her up after school. The mother is late, which apparently is nothing new. A sympathetic teacher keeps young Jennifer (played by the actress who later turns up as the ghost kid) company as they sit in the rain waiting for the mother. (Too bad the teacher's not as pragmatic as she is sympathetic, e.g. suggesting they wait inside where it's dry.) Finally the grim-faced mother arrives and wordlessly shoves the girl into the car before taking off. That's all we see of Jennifer's childhood, but I dwell on it since her love/hate (mostly the latter) relationship with her mother seems to overshadow her whole life, turns up in her dreams and weighs heavily on the ending.We jump ahead to modern times; the grown up Jennifer has migrated cross-country to New York and is now messily separating from her husband, who at first glance is standard-issue movie male chauvinist creep, an impression not much ameliorated by subsequent glances. He treats her so brutishly in front of supposedly neutral mediators (upon whom, one might have thought, he'd want to make a semi-good impression) and then, barely out of their earshot, so casually sneers that she's incapable of looking after their daughter on her own that she seems a little "off" just in her passive acceptance of such contempt. (I wondered how she found the gumption to leave him; she seemed more the sort who would take it forever, or until finally snapping and killing the bastard.) Needing to show the mediators she's in fact a "good mother," and being determined to remain near Manhattan for whatever reason, she seeks any available apartment and is willing to take any available crappy job (I won't mention the job again, since we never see her at it after she gets it).This brings us to the real star of the movie, the apartment. David Lynch would not have used it in "Eraserhead"---too depressing even for him. Roman Polanski maybe would've used it for "Repulsion." Alcatraz had more cheerful living conditions. On hand are a couple of excellent actors playing cartoonish characters: John C. Reilly as a glad-handing huckster whom one can picture luring immigrants off the boat into servitude in the 19th century, and Pete Postlethwaite with a vaguely-eastern-European accent as the kind of quirky handyman whom one suspects of stashing bodies under the floorboards. Jennifer moves in with her pixie-like daughter, who's a real treat. Strange things start happening, e.g. cancerous-looking water stains in the ceiling---well, you probably saw most of them in the trailer---and poor Jennifer starts coming seriously unglued.Let me skip most of the plot and the ending to focus on what made "Dark Water" work for me: the Oscar-worthy performance by Connelly (one reason it's too bad this was a horror flick) and the mood established by the director, who adds many small nice touches, e.g. after Jennifer finds some hair in her glass of water, she then just drinks bottled water when taking her mysterious medication. The director is aided immeasurably by the music of Angelo Badalamenti, who can capture genuine sadness like no one else; not since the pilot of "Twin Peaks" has a movie filled me with such a sense of regret. I wanted to reach in and yank Jennifer out of all the gloom and doom and insert her and her kid into a nice house in the suburbs somewhere.... The ending we do get is so inconclusive and unsatisfying that even the people who stuck it out after the bored teenagers wandered off to another screening room in the multiplex would have been justified in asking the musical question "Is that all there is..."Special mention for Tim Roth in an enhanced cameo role as an eccentric lawyer and the painfully underemployed Camryn Manheim as the kind of humorous and humane teacher every parent must wish their kids had. Finally a question: if, as we're led to believe at the end, the creepy husband was NOT trying to drive his wife nuts a la "Gaslight," then why DID we see him shmoozing with those two punks at one point? Or was it just poor old Jennifer "imagining things again..."Speaking of things Japanese, a special plug for the novel "Out" by Natsuo Kirino, readily available on Ebay or elsewhere; no ghosts but plenty of chills and dark humor--and dark water, but I won't specify what makes it dark--and you'll believe those characters are real. Walter Salles, looking for your next project?...</fullReview>

It builds you up with suspense but nothing afterwards. Then it repeats itself again building with you up with suspense then blah nada. In other words it had real good potential in the beginning but in the middle and end it failed to succeed. I felt there could have been more, more to support its idea of build up the suspense and leave you asking for more and more. Maybe next time Japanese movies should be released as is without it being a remake. I guess when they try to make a remake, being that it was considered successful in the first place, film makers try to out do the original or try to live up to it but ending up messing up. For example the The Grudge, I watched the original after the remake and I can honestly say it should have been released in the U.S. as a Japanese film, subtitle and all.</fullReview>

Less a ghost story than a psychological drama, DARK WATER has its share of scary moments but it ultimately is about the breakdown of the mother, played quite effectively by Jen Connelly, as everything -- an ex-husband seeking custody, the memory of her drug-addled, abusive mother and the ghost of a little girl that lives in the vacant apartment above her -- closes in on her. Not previously noted for her acting ability, here Connelly gives a bravura performance right up there with the likes of Nicole Kidman in THE OTHERS. John C. Reilly is hysterical as her fumbling, negligent landlord, and the daughter, Ariel Gade, ain't bad. Pete Postlethwaite lends adequate support as a belligerent handyman with a deep, dark secret. If the movie plays a little like THE RING, it's because the writer of this is the writer of THE RING. Be prepared: The ending is a major downer.</fullReview>

But unlike most (namely "The Ring", "The Grudge", etc.) this film has a certain factor(Jennifer Connelly) that the other movies lacked... Jennifer Connelly is superb as Dahlia Williams, her classic performance as an intensely tormented woman is in a word intense, not to mention the Presence of the two young stars ( Ariel Gabe, as well as Perla Haney-Jardine better known as B.B. Kiddo in Kill bill Vol.2). The movie in itself is more of a drama than a thriller, but it does cause moments of pure fear, "Seat jumping" experiences. The plot is Credible, although at times may seem Fantastical . It seems more like a tale of an emotionally distressed mother suffering from the stress of single parenting; whilst being hounded by a pestering ex-husband, than a special effects ridden movie about "Dark Water".. If your a Jennifer Connelly fan I know you will love it... If your not a Jennifer Connelly fan than see it for the fact that the movie itself is good.. I would see it again, and I don't say that about most movies.</fullReview>

Slowly developed tale of abandoned kids, discovered through circumstantial evidence? Checkarooni. Lots of water imagery? Check. Haunted bathroom? Check.Consider that last one closely. What is the Japanese obsession with water, particularly bathrooms, as a vehicle for death and haunting? Yes, I know, their country is surrounded by oceans. So is ours. That doesn't compel us to make EVERY SINGLE FILM about the perils of going swimming in the bathtub.The worst part of this movie, oddly, is not the flat acting, the hackneyed plot, the forgettable imagery, or the red herrings scattered liberally (and pointlessly) throughout the film. It's the extras, in which we see and hear the filmmakers gushing (there's that water imagery again) about how ar-tees-teek their vision is for, get this, hosing down their sets. They are really excited, like little kids, about just how WET these sets are going to be. Man oh man, these will be the wettest. Sets. Evahr! Then they offer you a DVD extra in which you can layer and mix the sounds of various flushing toilets, just like the real sound engineer from the film, in order to create the Ultimate Spooky Bathroom Scene!

		<fullReview>Unlike many of its predecessors based on Japanese "horror" films, this film achieves its goal. A tormented woman moves into a rundown apartment where things really keep taking a turn for the worse. Her personal situation is nowhere near perfect, and things might not get any better because of the move to the new residence.Jennifer Connely surpasses her work in "A Beautiful Mind" and "House of Sand and Fog". Her performance is marked by an intensity rarely seen in Hollywood movies. Her pain is palpable, her suffering harrowing, her transformations heartbreaking. As her character learns circumstances surrounding her relationship with her husband and daughter might have a negative outcome, she descends into despair. When some strange events start occurring in her apartment building, she doesn't descend into madness but moves into a condition that will either solve all problems or have horrific consequences.Walter Salle's film manages to present extraordinary circumstances and makes them believable. Not once, we in the audience, are treated to the typical displays of Hollywood nonsense. We are treated to a well written, directed, and acted film that explores the possibilities of a genre that usually takes the easy way out.It's disturbing, and the payoff is something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing and entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the film has a perfect integration of form and content and also of external and internal levels: what happens at the physical, visible level (the apartment itself, the water, the visions, etc.) is perfectly understandable at the psychological, invisible level (the mind of the characters, their history and their memories). The two perspectives are interchangeable all the time, giving the film a very agile plot and making it even more eerie. The timing is very good, there is good balance between action and reflection; the photography is impeccable. The director seems to bring out the best in the actors. All in all, it's intelligent entertainment, with a universal appeal: a Japanese story that takes place in New York City, told by a Brazilian director. Two thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror movie without the horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all...don't waste your money on this disappointment. Second, it's not even remotely scary. Third, the ghost story seemed to be a sub-plot of a child custody drama. Go see the original Japanese film Dark water. It's so much better. I'm not exactly sure what the writer and director were thinking here, but it'll be a flop. No doubt in my mind. Even the short story this film is based on is creepier. To me the Japanese are doing a hell of a better job with horror these days. If American producers wanna remake these movies, at least try to one up the original. It's just plain shameful. Oh well...maybe Skeleton key will be good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could've Been Something</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went to the premiere of this movie in NYCLet's start out with the positives: -Jennifer Connelly is a great actress and shows that she can carry a film. Her nuanced role in conveying a single mother struggling her own childhood fears in a suspicious environment is more than convincing -Roosevelt Island is beautifully photographed. I've lived in NYC for 25 years and never have I seen Roosevelt Island's spookiness captured on film the way it is in this filmCons:(SPOILERS) -Let's just say there is NO PLOT. A lot of ideas are introduced and this movie has the worst ending ever. -MANY characters (Tim Roth, John C. Reilly, Pete Postlewaithe, punk teenagers) are introduced and their eeriness is never spoken of, never elaborated upon. -There is NOTHING SCARY in this film. Instead of being immersed in this supernatural world, you are simply thinking "Where is this film going?" By the time the third act is introduced, the film proceeds in a truly predictable fashion.No one disputes Walter Salles' ability to make a great film. I am a big fan of MIDNIGHT and MOTORCYCLE DIARIES. Hopefully this is the first stepping stone for him to make a better American film, because this film is just bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting was well done. But I'm afraid that is where this movie stops. If you haven't guessed the entire plot of this stinker by the time the little girl "Ceci" reaches the roof, I hope you don't disappoint easily. Dahlia played by Jennifer Connelly, is a woman fighting a custody battle with her husband played by John C. Reilly. Dahilia and her daughter move to an apartment on one of the New York islands. Dahlia is plagued by leaks, headaches, and her husband threats to sue for full custody of Ceci. That's it.If you are looking for monsters, lurking phantoms, surprises, nope none of those appear in this turkey. I would say the movie reminds me of "Ringu" but without the video tape, thrills, mystery, suspense, dialog, and shocking twist ending.If you really want to see something like this movie, you could hang out at a low rent apartment complex or spend time at any "Friend of the Court Office". It won't cost as much and you will have spent your time wiser.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I were to build a car, a gorgeous and solidly designed automobile and it didn't have an engine; then I failed in a fundamental way.The acting was great, what little interest I had was carried by it's strong cast and I found myself caring more for the real-life drama more than the ghost. The supernatural was an interruption rather than what the film should have been about.Bottom line, want scares? Well, you will find an absolutely none. Want a decent drama about a woman on her own? You'll find here and oh yea...there is this ghost problem.Because it was a failure in what it set out to do, it wasted two hours of my life with it's utter dullness.( Made worse than normal since I was expecting a thriller.) I give it a one out of ten. Please Hollywood, stop lying in your advertising.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was entertaining to say the least.. If you had thrown a TV with some fuzz on the screen you have yourself the Ring 3. Many parts of the movie you are waiting to spook yourself, i.e. when Jen. Con. is looking in the mirror you expect to see someone appear but you never do, thus making you scare yourself. The whole little girl drowning thing just doesn't do it for me anymore. If this movie offered your money back I'd have 8 bucks in my wallet right now. Go see the movie if you want to see a splish splash scary movie about a little girl who attacks from the dead after drowning because of a negligent mother, then your in the right place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Dark Water" -- A Good Summer Scare!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dark Water" is just what you've been waiting for?! If this is your kind of flick?or even if it's not?"Dark Water" is a great movie escape from the sweltering summer heat, the drumbeat of war, plus terrorism and whatever else ails you. It will transport you to a dark and rainy place where ghosts dare to intrude.Academy award winner Jennifer Connelly stars as Dahlia, the recently divorced mother of six-year-old Cecilia, played by Ariel Gade. These two actors anchor this film and turn in excellent performances as mother and daughter nervously seeking a low-cost apartment close to New York City. They are nicely supported by John C. Riley as Mr. Murray (the building manager), Pete Postlethwaite as Veeck (the scruffy on-site superintendent), Tim Roth as Jeff Platzer (a lawyer with problems of his own), Dougray Scott as Kyle (the ex-husband) and Camryn Manheim as the teacher.Murray tries to put a good face on all of the "not-so-nice" aspects of the disgusting apartment in a dilapidated building on Roosevelt Island?a coat of paint, a little clean up and -- what a view! Of course, there's that ugly dark stain on the bedroom ceiling? and dripping and worse. There are mysterious sounds blamed on the bad boys who live downstairs. Things really get going when Ceci reveals a friendship with an invisible friend, Natasha, that she maintains is real."Dark Water" offers a tight script and great acting that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. Hold on for one of the best frights you can get. Watch out, here comes the "Dark Water"! Try to stop shaking and gagging?it's only a movie?right? Rated an 8 out of 10 for the Best Scare of the Summer (so far).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good But Horrible ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that dark water was one of the better "Horror Films" of recent years. While viewing this film, I found myself in an uncomfortable state. But, This movie lacked an adequate ending. The ending that they had chosen for this film, was horrible. Walter Salles is a renown director and I'm appalled that he didn't find flaw in its selective ending. I'm also surprised that its early viewers didn't complain and ask for a different ending. I would not recommend this film due to its horrible ending, and that's that. I strongly advise that you do not see this film while it's in theaters. Wait for it on cable and don't waste your money seeing this film in theaters or renting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't let the trailer fool you... movie is NOT a thriller/suspense/horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may have allowed two things affect my initial reasoning to even go see the movie. First off, I loved The Ring and thought this may have the same undertones/themes as that. Secondly, the trailers and previews for the movie make it out to be scary and suspenseful. Unfortunately the movie does not deliver on either of my initial thoughts. The film overall was very slow and lacked any real emotion from me. The character development was non-existent and the story went no where. When the ending of the movie is approaching (don't worry you CANNOT miss it) you think to yourself "is that all... there has to be more" but you are sadly disappointed that there isn't.I can't believe this film has been rated as high as some have given it. There are no new concepts, ideas, styles, stories, or themes... this film is HIGHLY disappointing.My final thought: in order to really enjoy the good movies, you have to see the bad ones. So we all do enjoy the next great movie, go out and see "Dark Water" so we can remember how HORRIBLE movies can actually be!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would say the best part of this movie is actually a pretty descent sound track. Other than that the plot line is alright but probably better as a book. Over all the movie tends to drag on and when it finally starts to show promise, it ends. Even then it leaves you wondering why you sat that long trough it. This movie in my opinion is one to catch for rent at some point. Don't waste the money to see it in theaters. This movie was written originally as a book by the same individual who wrote the Ring. Obviously this guy has some strange obsession with little dead girls and water. Once again I would not waste the time or money to see it in theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is dark, the end is depressing and quite a let down, and it is not scary in the least. Rather than a horror movie I'd classify it as a drama or perhaps psychological thriller if I was feeling generous.The acting was superb, the film as a whole was fairly interesting, and the director did well with what he had to work with but having only those things going for it was not enough to make a good movie.The storyline in Dark Water was one of main the failing points, in fact it is VERY reminiscent of the Ring, only, you know, without the scary or sinister parts.Rent the Ring if you want a good movie, or even the Grudge, you needn't bother with this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A creepy apartment in New York? What is this, a reality show? I have no hesitation in saying that this has to be the worst movie I have seen all year. With such a stellar cast I had such high expectations and unfortunately, as in so many cases, my hopes were dashed. For about two hours I was waiting for something to happen, anything at all. The acting was mediocre, the plot was thin and it was just too darn long. I think that script writers should appreciate that just because a film was once a decent Japanese short story, it is not necessarily going to transform in to the next "Ring". Please, save your time and money and watch something else...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The awful reality of a vulnerable mother.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Don't let the rain come down" goes the old song. Not since Mike Nichols liberally used water as an ambivalent motif in The Graduate has water had such a psychological impact as it does in Dark Water, a thriller that abundantly uses horror story techniques but goes further to expose the tender nerve endings of a single mom, Dahlia, caught in a cheap Roosevelt Island apartment that drenches her and her young daughter, Ceci, incessantly both inside and out with leaking ceilings and flooding floors that promise drowning both real and figurative.Outside the obligatory ghost, incompetent apartment super, and conflicted dad lies the awful reality of vulnerable women being forced to live in substandard housing, dangerous to health because separation leaves separating wife and husband with no means to do better. Jennifer Connelly as Dahlia has the right blend of intelligence and helplessness to bring off what might have been just another distraught 30-year old mom with seriously disturbing images of her own mother abandoning her early in life. The parallel legend of an abandoned little girl turned ghost and befriending Ceci emphasizes the universal problems faced by single mothers everywhere.Director Walter Salles knows how to make Roosevelt Island look bleaker than an abandoned Riker's Island, more foreboding than Manhattan at dusk in a dirty winter, and yet as desirable as the nearest suburb given the astronomical rents on Manhattan Island in any year. The socially conscious Salles also hints at the secret lives of other Roosevelt detainees: a lawyer who lies about his domestic life and an apartment manager whose blather about the advantages of the decrepit apartment hides the horrors of leaking ceilings are just a few of the menaces the lonely mother faces. Salles suggest the sacrifices a mother might have to make for her child are never gone, about as bleak as the island itself on its rainy days. Find a similar sense of abandonment and horror in The Others (2001). Any film that makes Manhattan warm by contrast is scary itself. The marginalized life of a distressed young mother has never been so well expressed as in this film, where islands are metaphors for people. "Oh, it 's a snug little island! A right little, tight little island." Thomas Dibdin (1771-1841): The Snug Little Island.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dark Water" may be from the same creators, but it fails to terrify like "The Ring." In "Dark Water" evil takes shape in memories of Dahlia's traumatic past, a crooked landlord, and a lazy building superintendent. This makes the movie infinitely less scary than "The Ring" in which evil was embodied in the mysterious and frightening Samara.Although less scary, since it isn't always clear whether Natasha is real or a product of Dahlia's fears and troubled psyche, this is an interesting twist. Both Natasha and young Dahlia are played by Haney-Jardine, but from the quick glimpses in the beginning of the film it isn't obvious at first that they are same girl. It's also interesting to guess at what is haunting the other characters?greed, guilt, or the desire to sympathize with a traumatized mother since movie is depicted from Dahlia's perspective.This movie is definitely different and probably a safe bet for those who like scary movies, but prefer not to get too scared. The suspense in some scenes does offer the opportunity get a little spooked, but wasn't enough that anyone jumped in their seats or screamed.Those hoping for a serious scare should pass this movie up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it has nothing scary..nothing interesting..just dirty water The story itself moves so slowly and uneventfully that we are virtually (and vainly) begging for some cheap scare to keep us interested. There are no plot points whatsoever. Characters are introduced arbitrarily, they do things without a reason and in the end we're presented a solution that's only slightly explicable if you've seen the original and know what the story is supposed to be about. Jennifer Connelly and the rest of the fine cast do their best to save "Dark Water", but they're fighting against windmills. This movie couldn't even scare my girlfriend and that's saying a lot, because she is freaked out by even the tamest ghost stories. So, don't waste your time on this and go see the original instead</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dreadful remake of a classy Asian thriller. How can you have Jennifer Connolly, Tim Roth and Pete Postlethwaite at your disposal, PLUS you have an excellent first film on which to work from, and yet turn out this massive disappointment ? Whoever went to the studio and said I can make this so much better, was wrong, wrong, wrong. The production values and acting are excellent but the director must have forgot he is meant to be making a horror film. Disappointment isn't the word. Half way through they resort to standard scares such as dream sequences and using sound effects to jolt the audience. Rubbish, just rubbish. If you are going to remake something, you should give it more thought. Parts of this just don't make sense and some scenes are laughable, like how they try to scare you over and over again with shots of "dark water" coming out of the taps, the toilet, etc. At one point Jennifer Connolly is in the basement of the flats, doing her laundry, and she is meant to be terrified by the water inside the washing machine turning black. She stares at the washing machine in horror and I was just left laughing my head off. How many of us sit and watch the washing machine go round ?! In hindsight that would be preferable to watching Dark Water. Top marks for the classy acting on show and the lighting and camera-work are impressive too but in this case the end product is definitely less than the sum of its parts.</fullReview>

She's lovely and sexually astounding.Now I am too much of a Jennifer Connely fan to miss one of her leading roles, in fact I love every bit of her; she is way too hot and glamorous for the role in DARK WATER?a slightly blander?and way suppler-- Monica Bellucci, if you will; she's also way too healthy for the role. There are at least a few of us who believe the Asian original of this shallow remake might be THE BEST HORROR EVER. The contrast is too stunning. I have seen one half of DARK WATER; it's horrendous rubbish?not even one single scene works?the typical vacuumed flat American junk?no sense for anything whatsoever. When I was 12 yrs I was asking for more from a horror movie; DARK WATER almost makes the Americanized RING look like a pretty good movie, with Naomi Watts and all ?. And they had JENNIFER CONNELY to put to good use! Everything is so crass, messy and dull and uninspired, so insipid and tern ?.Connely's character is so messed up?does this woman look, dear pals, like one who lives in the austere abstinence her Japanese original requires? What dark water? Jennifer is a babe made to love and breed. She might act in a noir thriller?not in such terse Asian creepy mysteries. She's a healthy fecund fertile American young woman?not a doomed neurotic frail female as required by the exemplary Japanese creation. What her healthy persona needs and asks for is a stud, not a ghost. Jenny as a haunted young female is one of the worse miscasts ever.Some horror fans?myself included?were brought on a much stronger diet than such bland melodramas. The Japanese pretty much took the lead?more power to them, we'll be true to our earlier creed and follow this lead.Bottom?line, this Jennifer remains one of my actresses, regardless such _faux pas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can Someone do something to these Bad Ghosts?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Grudge, The Ring , Dark water, all derivatives from Japanese films and inherent with one common problem: we don't know why these ghosts turn so bad and we can do nothing about it! Ghost films used to be entertaining. There were bad ghosts and some good ones. But then even bad ghosts are bad for some reasons. They used to come back and seek for revenge from the bad guys who had done harm to them in their lives. They rarely did harm to innocent people around them apart from scaring them a bit incidentally.Yet this series of Japanese stories headed by Samara from the Ring depicted stories of real bad ghosts coming back to harm innocent human beings for no or selfish reasons. Now this is very unhealthy! Dark Water depicted a ghost(a young girl) who had eventually robbed another young girl off her mother by murdering her right on the spot, after blackmailing the mother for her daughter's life. Now this it hurting.Why did a 5 year old innocent girl become a bad ghost and possess so much power after death? Why didn't the mother possess the same power to stop her after her death?We don't want to see the bad guys(dead or alive) winning at the end. Are there no ways to fight such ghosts? What if this ghost want some company and decide to get Ceci later on? Then the mother would have sacrificed for nothing and this is likely to be the case as there's no one who can stop the ghost from getting what she wants.Who would enjoy a storyline like this? Or do Japanese have a different culture?</fullReview>

I personally believe it was a waste of time because of how slow moving it was and the themes that were in the movie. I am young, so that may have something to do with it not holding my attention. If you are a good listener or enjoy movies with extreme depth, go ahead and watch it.

		<shortDescription>made my top 5 worst list</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider myself a reasonably intelligent and objective person who is actually quite easy to please when it comes to entertainment. I actually have a very short list of films that I have considered bad enough to either walk out of the theater or shut off the VHS/DVD. Unfortunately, for most people on this site who have reviewed "dark water," this film happens to be one of them. I'd like to make it clear that anyone who rated this film a "1" is just being silly or ridiculous. It had your basic "artistic" moments. It had some semi-interesting characters in it. But despite this, I actually felt bored and dissatisfied throughout 2/3 of the film (I didn't hang around for the grand finale, because at that point the film had proved it wasn't worth the wait). Some people might say that's where the film "really picked up" and redeemed itself. But you know what, if I have to wait until the end of a film to have it finally stimulate me, then the film failed, despite how it ended. Now I understand that people may want to separate bad/false marketing with the actual film itself, but I think there are certain cases where this isn't acceptable. It's almost inexcusable. When I rented this film, it was under the premise that it WAS a horror/suspense film that would keep me on the edge of my seat. And considering that I specifically rented it with a friend who was trying to overcome their trepidation towards these types of films, this is the type of film I expected to help them gage this. Instead, what we viewed was a painstakingly slow, uninspired film that took 70 of it's first 105 minutes to go absolutely nowhere and establish very little in the story. That is just too long to expect an audience to hold their interest in an already too thin plot to begin with, and I don't care what genre of film we're talking about. Even if this film was marketed properly, my opinion would stand firm. I actually can appreciate a slow paced, thought evoking drama, if it is done right. Dark Water just came up short in too many critical areas for it to be even considered worth a rental. 5 out 0f 10. Wait for cable to be disappointed. My Immortal Beloved......that is good drama.......Les Miserables......that is good drama........Dark Water.......is not:)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it's a Schreckfest alright, and sometimes an effective one. Lots of eerie scenes. A dead body or two but no bloodshed. The atmosphere is terrific. The photography and production design deserve credit. And the players are uniformly professional.Pete Postlethwaite's face seems made up of lumps of play-do. John Reilly, as the apartment house manager, is sincerely phony. The little kid does as well as any little kid could do. Tim Roth as the lawyer doesn't have much of a part as Platzer the lawyer but comes across as reassuringly reasonable, the only halfway trustworthy person we meet.Jennifer Connolly as Dahlia has matured and from some angles is unrecognizable as the virginal ice princess of, say, "Hot Spot." She's no longer a succulent girl but a beautiful and statuesque woman, even aside from the flawless geometry of her nose. With maturity has come a little more energy, or so it seems to me, judging from her performances here and in "A Beautiful Mind." The plot itself, regrettably, is so dark as to be almost impenetrable to logic. Frankly, I got lost. I was able to identify the influence of -- let me think -- "The Shining," "Psycho," "Repulsion," and "The Exorcist." Not just in the plot but in individual shots.The movie is a scary enough experience, and I guess if that's all it was intended to be, it succeeds. But it doesn't make much sense. Nothing "stands for" anything else. The water, for instance. In Connolly's dilapidated apartment it drips through the ceiling from the apartment above, it rushes from the faucets the color of Brown 25, it explodes from toilets. Sometimes it floods the floors, black and turgid. In the end, Connolly seems to drown in it. Is it real? Or is it some paranoid hallucination on Connolly's part? Sometimes it's real. The manager, the lawyer, and the custodian all see it and react with disgust. Other times the fluid, looking like something just flushed from an ancient rusty car radiator, gushes out of faucets and toilets in the little girl's school when Connolly is nowhere near, and the school teacher simply describes the floors as "flooded." Flooded with WHAT? The kid has an imaginary playmate who insists on sticking around, yanking the kid's hand while she's trying to finger paint. This mysterious spirit, which I'm tempted to call "Mistress Howdy", seems to be connected to another little girl who drowned in the water tower on the roof but I'm not sure. Both Connolly and the daughter get to see this dead little girl. (Whose hallucination IS this, anyway?) Finally, Connolly manages to save her own little girl from being drowned by the spirit of the other, at which point Connolly seems to be crushed by a veritable Niagara Falls of water from the apartment upstairs. The medical verdict on cause of death? "Not apparent." Well that's really frustrating because nobody dies from hallucinated water. Yet if the water is of this world, it would have been present in sufficient quantity to flush all the roaches and all the furniture and all the people out of the entire ten-story hovel.Still, it at least has the virtue of giving the viewer an arousal jag without the easy shots of throats being slit and virgins being disemboweled. Some work went into the execution of the plan. It's the plan itself that's weak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where does teenage stereo-typing come into play?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I highly disagree with the fact that only uneducated teens with A.D.D. would dislike this movie. I highly disliked it for the fact that the story ended as soon as the pieces were being pulled together, and I'm not a teenager. Many enjoyable thrillers end the same way, but as for Dark Water I was waiting for there to be a plot that was maybe a tad bit different from The Ring. There was character building (finally!) but that's about all I can say for this movie.How can you NOT relate this movie to The Ring? And if you are at all educated with Hitchcock's theory for horror, then you would know that mutilated corpses aren't the only thing people look for in a scary movie. I think most people are smarter than you think, thank you. Think M. Night Shyamalan! He uses imagination to scare the audience instead of gore most the time. And who do you think sees his movies? Teens! I think that your stereo-typing comment was hilarious. "Go home and listen to their Korn c.d. and smoke pot?" Whatever! Why don't you just voice why you liked the movie, state why you disagree with the people who didn't like the movie and keep your "grown-up" comments about the youth of today to yourself. I sure do hope my kid never listens to your comments. She'll end up thinking there's no way to impress society today and just give up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a piece of crap. The whole thing is slow, and it really doesn't have a strong plot or storyline. Not scary, and not even interesting. There wasn't even good special effects to cover up the ridiculous story! Jennifer Conneley is a good actress, but she stunk like ass in this "movie". Basically the story is about a mom and her daughter who move into a dumpy apartment with a leak in the ceiling. Most of the movie is based on a little "ghost girl" (how original) even though we don't see the "ghost" until the end. I could have thought up of such a better movie. This movie had no action, violence, story-- only slow drama. Don't waste your time renting this movie. I guarantee it will make your life easier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was nothing much to say after watching this except maybe " why did I watch this?" It wasn't all that scary, it was more dark than scary. It was well titled, there was definitely a lot of "dark water". I should have followed my instincts and shut it off after the tour through the apartment. I would have lived in a used bread delivery truck before I would have moved into that dump. I have trouble getting into films where the actors do something really stupid in order to set up the story line. I have trouble with the entire story line, it was very weak, and the ending kept me wondering if it was really over, was that it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A well-shot, very visual film.And that's where it ended for me. As far as psychological thrillers go, this one was a sleeper. There was a lot of effort put into the cinematography, and certainly the acting by the lead players... but half an hour into it, I couldn't help but wonder where the suspense was going. It just kept slowly building, building, building... and then building some more.The peripheral characters - the angry ex-husband, the lawyer, the teacher - all basically non-contributors to the actual plot, which was centered around the psychological mess of a mother. Sadly, little detail is given to the viewer to understand why this is happening to her and her daughter. The subplots were more of a distraction to the suspense than aids in building a good story. What was with the black dude in the back of the lawyer's SUV? I don't know and you won't either, because he's there for a few moments and then gone, forever, from the story. When you have two hours or so to tell a story, it's imperative that every character contribute something to the end result - and in this flick, there are just too many things to distract. That's not psychological; it's bad screen writing.Again, excellent cinematography: excellent attention to colors and detail - but as far as overall direction and making a point, it was hard to swallow. There are far better psychological thrillers around, and this film had a hard time defining its identity: look at the comments on the boards. Was it horror? No, not really. Was it drama? Maybe. There's too much debate amongst those who have seen it and that, frankly, is the kiss of death for this one.Unless you are prepared to appreciate the subtle details as presented visually, it will be a disappointment. Rating it at a 6 for the visual detail, I could not give it more as it will never appeal to more than a niche audience. Cinematographers and budding artists will appreciate it, yet it's no surprise that this film never reached critical mass. It's not cohesive enough to persuade the average thrill-seeking film goer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thanks to 'Dark Water' I now have two birthdays.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The day I was delivered from my mother and the day I watched 'Dark Water' are very important to me, one for the obvious reason and the other... . I've been delivered from ever having to watch another "J-Horror" movie, the variety of motion picture that concerns itself with children, malign spirits, malign parents, malign children, and all points on atmosphere. First was the dreadful 'The Ring', then the dreadful 'The Grudge', and now, finally, the movie that seals the deal -- 'Dark Water'.It's all in place here: divorced parents, dark history of one of the parents, puddles of water, little girls with long hair, irresolute story lines, extraneous characters, cheats on the audience... I could go on and on describing the elements that make "J-Horror" the schlock it so clearly loves being but I won't bother. When you sit to watch 'Dark Water' do yourself a favor: predict the ending before opening credits begin. Have everyone you are watching with do the same. Next, predict the elements of horror the filmmakers will be using. Choose from the following list:(a) Macabre puddles of water (b) Little, mysterious girls with long hair (c) Little, mysterious girls ill-dressed for the activity they'll be involved in (think raincoat in the bathtub, for example) (d) Mirrors reflecting something not in front of mirror (e) Ledges, ledges, ledges! (f) Tank of water, sad-faced woman looking at corpse in tank (g) Malign girl-spirit in tank of water (h) "Although this residence is evil... still.. must.. sleep.. here!" (i) "Although this residence is evil... still.. must.. go.. in.. to get.. cursed!" (j) Imaginary friends? You bet. and, finally, (k) Forgiveness for the malign spirit, the malign spirit is malign and doesn't care about your petty forgiveness.Now, for the first element (prediction of the ending): If you don't have an 80-100% success rate then you, and your cronies, need to either work a little harder or find a new group of people to watch bad movies with.For the second element (the Handy Guide To Making A J-Horror Film List): Pick any three to four elements, any will do, and have a single mother looking after her son/daughter. As long as the aforementioned elements are included in your script, the script will write itself, be picked up by Hollywood, and the posters advertising your new film will almost necessarily include the words "Based on the Chilling Japanese Horror Shocker 'INSERT ANY TWO Japanese WORDS HERE'." Now, pocket your 1.2-2.0 million dollars, thank Gore Verbinski/Takashi Shimizu/Hideo Nakata for realizing your 'chilling vision', and repeat the process using at least one new element included in the above list. You can't lose.You don't have to thank me, really. Just don't see 'Dark Water'. An interesting note: my original review was going to be, simply, a single word. Any guesses as to what that word may have been?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another bad remake of a Japanese hit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the sleazy owner shows Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) and her daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade) around a run down apartment, he makes a big deal out of the fact that the shower door is made from toughened glass. No prizes for guessing that someone gets trapped in the shower later on. Such is the low level of inventiveness on show in Dark Water, a US remake of Hideo Nakata's Japanese ghost movie.Dahlia is in the process of divorce, has little money and so reluctantly takes the apartment. Then all manner of weird happenings occur ? water constantly drips from the ceiling, footsteps are heard in the empty room above, and Ceci starts talking to an 'imaginary friend' Natasha. Could Natasha possibly be the ghost of the missing child from the room above? Will Dahlia find the body? Will the body be somewhere watery? Yep, yep and yep again. Ho hum.Walter Salles's remake is slow, dreary and very predictable and viewers expecting either a spooky or scary film should be warned ? Dark Water is neither. Despite good performances from leads Connelly and Gade, this film cannot escape the fact that we've seen this kind of thing many times before, and in far superior films. The ending, an attempt at bringing some life into this dismal film, only ends up confusing the viewer, as Natasha suddenly turns nasty and tries to off Ceci in order to take her place. The manner in which Dahlia saves her daughter is a complete let down (and thus, I suppose, is in keeping with the rest of the film).I haven't seen the original Dark Water yet, but it is in my 'to view' pile of DVDs; it will be interesting to see how it compares...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Title: Dark Water (2005) Director: Walter Salles Cast: Tim Roth, Jennifer Connelly Review: There's been a rash of Japanese films that have been remade by American filmmakers. These films have been re molded, rewritten and re-everything so that American audiences can enjoy a bastardized version of the original. Films like The Ring and The Grudge are a result of Americas desire to imitate Japanese box office success. Sometimes it works and sometimes it don't. Dark Water came and went and for the most part American audiences didn't even realize it. Why didn't this movie work the same way other remakes had? What went wrong? Well the story is about a mother and her daughter. Mother and father are fighting over the custody of the little one. Lawyers are involved. Mother and father hate each other, but life must go on. The mother, played by Jennifer Connelly is trying hard to be the best mother that she can. Shes trying to find a suitable place to live on her meager budget and she wants to get her daughter in a good school. So, of they go to find a new apartment to live in. The find one in a very skanky looking building, but it will have to do since money is low. Once they settle in, weird things begin to happen. Could it be that they have a poltergeist? So there's a couple of good things and a couple of bad things to say about this movie. Ill start with the good. First off, the director decided that he wanted to make a film that imitate in feel and performances those solid horror movies from the seventies. You know that time in which solid directors like Kubrick and Polanski were making horror movies like The Shinning and Rosemarys Baby. Movies that took themselves seriously and had the boldness of using real actors (!) instead of the latest WB teen star. Dark Water is that type of horror film. We get a really good solid cast with Oscar caliber actors like Connelly and great actors like Tim Roth and John C Reilly. At one point I saw them all together on one take and I went whoa! This films got a really good cast! So its got that going for it. The direction is top notch, the movie has this rainy humid feel to it all through out that's perfect for the movies watery theme. It kind of looks like something that David Fincher might have cooked up. You know, lots of green and yellow filters.Sadly, in spite of the movie having all these good things going for it, it's a film that's afraid to be what its supposed to be. It's a horror film that doesn't feel like a horror film. It's a ghost story that is shying away from going all the way with its poltergeist theme. Just when you think the movie will turn up its intensity, it doesn't. It gives real world explanations to everything so you'll go "maybe its not a ghost, maybe shes just imagining everything." And when it does decide to go all the way, its already to little too late. I believe it would have helped if the movie didn't try to be so grounded in reality. It is after all a ghost story.On top of that, its very very low on originality. The whole "little ghost girl" has been done to death. The Asian culture is specially guilty of overusing the spooky little ghost girl plot device. Think about it, The Ring, The Grudge and now Dark Water are all practically about the same thing. I could even go further and mention similarities with films like The Changelling and Fear.com. So when this remake comes along its got a tired old feeling that made me roll my eyes to the back of my head quite a few times saying "Here we go again". So it looses a point for not being all that original. In fact Ill go even further by saying that this movie is almost an exact duplicate of Ring Two, and of course that makes sense since Ring Two and the original Japanese version of Dark Water were both directed by Japanese director Hideo Nakata so that's another thing that this remake had going against it. Its similarities with too many films.So in conclusion, Dark Water wasn't necessarily a bad movie. Its well made, well acted and has its moments. Its just not terribly exciting. It was missing that little extra oomph! To make it stand out. It's a ghost story that chooses to not show its ghost for a laaaaarge chunk of the film, it kind of goes against itself that way.Rating: 2 1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing new here, another aimless attempt at a thriller with Connelly for star power and a paper-thin storyline. Many of the elements are mimiced from movies such as the Grudge, The others, and cold creek manor. I'm surprised that Connelly took this role after winning an Academy Award- this just isn't the type of movie that builds a career, rather its one that tears it apart. Connelly really doesn't shine, or even impress as her role as a single mother who daintily scampers around an apartment building having encounters with ghosts. The little girl does a decent job, but cannot carry the movie alone, especially with such a weak script. The secondary characters are VERY weak and add nothing to the story. I'm giving a 4/10 and thats pretty generous, I did enjoy some of the backdrops of the scenery, and the little girl did an adequate job for what she was given. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Miss Connelly is falling under Marisa Tomei-syndrome: she's an Oscar-winning actress subjected to bad/mediocre movies since 2001. Her first appearance after winning the gold for "A Beautiful Mind" was "Hulk". Oy vey! Then "The House of Sand and Fog" followed (which wasn't bad, but Jennifer could of done a lot better). Now this. And this film was released in the summer as if this would be the ultimate "Sixth Sense". The ending was stupid and ambiguous, and it was a shame to see John C. Reilly ("Boogie Nights") and Tim Roth (Quentin's English golden boy) in dreck like this. I rented it the other night really hoping that it would get better, and every time it didn't, I just kept telling myself, " No wonder it didn't play long!"If you can, avoid this and watch "The Sixth Sense" again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe this film has an average rating of 5.4 stars! What are you people thinking? The pacing of this film is just awful. I love bad movies, I love bad horror movies even more. But this just isn't worth it.Maybe the novel is something good, but this movie isn't scary and is rather boring. Even just the monocrome color scheme that never lets up just beats down the viewer. I know things like that in this film are supposed to set some kind of tone and purpose, but with no contrast at any point, even at the end, its just dull and dumb.I am sure the Japanese version of this film is a million times better. I completely fail to understand why make an 'american' version of this film that sucks and dies at the box office, and why not release the real version throughout the US. It probably would have done better. John C. Reilly nails his role as the sleazy landlord and obviously is a talented actor, its unfortunate he had to be part of this bad movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is so bad that it isn't good enough to be a bad copy of The Ring. It seems that the director is the same, but he must have been in a bad day when he directed Dark Water. For those of you who have seen The Ring, the best thing to do is not to watch this one (and for those who haven't, also). It's a very poor attempt of a copy of The Ring.Basically, a similar story, but with nothing to it. You can guess the end of the movie 10 minutes after you sat down to watch it. And watching it until the end is useless. I did, but I was hoping for some of the qualities The Ring had. Boy, was I wrong ... You can't blame the actors, either. It is really the screenplay and the direction that are no good. Wasted an evening and the cost of the ticket ... And, by the way, I think it would be very difficult for it to be worse.</fullReview>

I should've warned you and I'm sorry that you lost 2 hours of your life to that horrible, horrible film. I was busy after I saw it and didn't think of it until recently. I know it was selfish to not post this the minute I got home.With that said I would now encourage you to read on!DO NOT SEE DARK WATER!!!! It was by far the worst movie I have ever seen; It was even worse than anything created starring pop music stars(such as "On the L" and that horrible one w/ Kelly and Justin from American Idol that i can't even bear to think of the name, less my teeth might reach around and eat my brain...). It was so bad that when my friend and I were done watching, we stood up and asked if "anyone actually liked it." and we did not get a positive response! The entire crowd hated the movie! So much... that near the end, when my friend and I were making fun of the movie, people around us were not only NOT mad, but they were laughing along. There was a part at the end where the girl is told to close the door to the apt. where her mother was killed(by a ghost-don't even get me into the totally un-scary and STUPID plot) and instead she enters...we said that "now she deserves to die".

		<fullReview>It would be good if Dark Water shows to the American film industry that some of the currently exploited trends are getting rancid as the water of this remake. Dark Water is one more of the Hollywood's adaptations of Asian horror movies. Once again they use Hideo Nakata's successfully created material. And they hire a foreign director that has had success with two of a list of movies, Diarios de Motocicleta and Estación do Brasil were both critically acclaimed. But was he ready to direct a horror flick? It seem like he wasn't or maybe the producers are the bad guys here and he is the next John Carpenter, who knows? The script is quite a mess; it only shows one scene of high tension and desperation felt by one of the characters at the end of the movie. Desperation is the source of fear, we can only feel the fear that exudes characters if they are in danger or they feel that way, this is quintessential in horror and it's the reason why Dark Water almost has no real scaring scenes. Dark Water has an intimate way of story-telling, showing how the supporting characters are when they hide their true nature. But at the end this works against the final result due to a not so little unfinished subplot involving the father of Ceci. Many movies with more ridiculous premises and much less budget are more respectful to what is horror. The last half of Dark Water is better than the first half. The last half doesn't show new ideas but at least tries to give some satisfaction to the audience. One can imagine Dahlia having this imaginary thought "oh yeah, there's a ghost in my house, well I'll deal with that once I have solved my familiar problems (?????)" or at least it looks like that is the posture of Jennifer Connelly's Dhalia.Jennifer Connelly's performance is adequate, even tough in the highly dramatic scenes she shares with Ariel Gade (her fictional daughter) the result is erratic she seems too theatrical and Ariel appears as a dull young actress. Dealing the movie mainly with the whole mother-daughter motto this is not an insignificant matter. Tim Roth's performance is a redeeming note, he is an amazing actor in supporting roles (remember Pulp Fiction?) here he creates one interesting lawyer.The music and cinematography are way too standard also. The score is the average for a psychological horror-thriller work but the cinematography has some shots that look too raw for a blockbuster like this one unless the intention was create something stylish but it certainly doesn't look good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Utter Rubbish! The film is an hour and so of absolute boredom, nothing at all happens in the film to keep you gripped. bad story, and bad acting. the first hour and half just drags and the last 10 minutes is just pathetic, the film seems rushed. it is yet another failure of a remake just like the ring. it isn't one bit scary like the ring, and i would like to know when all these Japanese horrors are going to be stopped from being remade, they're getting worse, the ring and the grudge were bad enough until this came along. i don't know why its been rated so 'high' it deserves to be in the bottom 100 along side those other terrible remakes. i advise you to miss this film as you too will surely get bored and expect your money back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, for starters, this movie is NOT scary worth my life. No jumps, no scary faces, only a soft child's voice. The story is basically the same as the Ring only there are ZERO jumps. At least in the ring I jumped in the beginning closet seen but thats about it. There's nothing to connect to the real world about the movie to scare you. The movie is more suspense then anything, and there isn't much suspense! Half the movie they are deciding on whether or not to get the apartment. Nothing scary, they are just looking at the apartment. The only thing that is decent about the movie is the end. Most of the things don't connect. And once again, I would like to say that this movie SUCKS!! As in, there is nothing in it. For most of the time I was waiting for it to start. In the end I was thinking it just started.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is absolute crap! The film lasts about 95mins and in this time the supernatural activity has a total of 5mins and that's after a boring 90min build up. The story is this....Dahlia is going through a messy divorce and must find a cheap place for her and her daughter to live even if it means living in a small flat with a black ceiling dripping ooze. Her daughter predictably starts talking to the ghost of the little girl and is thought to be crazy, adding to her mother's distress. A long while of boring talk later is the climax which only lasts for 5mins and is unsatisfying anyway. This remake was a waste of time and money and i strongly urge everyone NOT to see it! See The Descent or The Devil's Rejects instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, the great Hollywood Machine sucks in a really great film and spits out a completely worthless remake. The original Japanese DARK WATER (though highly derivative of THE RING) is creepy and scary and everything a good horror movie should be. In it's American incarnation, however, all the life has been sucked out of it and what's left is dull, dull, dull. I can't even give it credit for the great cast because it's so utterly BAD. It's sad that many people might be turned off to seeking out real Japanese horror movies because a lot of the Americanized versions are churned out by hacks who just don't get it.Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film fails on all counts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you feel there's something innately frightening about a child who wants to be cared for, this film will set you shrieking like the giddy, "omigod omigod" teenaged girls who sat a few rows behind me in the theater. No doubt fans of The Ring, these girls probably coughed up the nine-buck ticket price expecting to be treated to the spectacle of another Samara slithering across the screen, dark matted locks obscuring her corpse-pale face.Natasha, the sinister presence of Dark Water, fairly withers in comparison to her fellow wraith. Though she suffered a similar untimely death (drowning in a water tower as opposed to a well), Natasha sports neither creepy coif nor decaying dermis. In fact, she resembles most closely not Samara, but Ceci, the living and breathing daughter of Dahlia, 9F's new tenant. So when Natasha fixes her gaze on Dahlia and utters "Don't leave me," the effect is heartbreaking rather than shriek-worthy, I'm afraid.The film's climax, in which Natasha holds a struggling Ceci under the bubbly water of her tub, is indeed disturbing, but for the wrong reason. The director clearly intended an epic clash between innocence and unbridled evil, but due to Natasha's lack of a ghostly demeanor, what we see is entirely different--not a demon but a normal little girl harming another little girl. Needless to say, such a scene is much more harrowing than any display of fantastical, supernatural violence. Shame on Salles for making us sit through it.The ending doesn't sit well, either. Dahlia, seeing no other option, sacrifices herself, offering to be Natasha's mother "forever" if she will let Ceci live. (Why? Those cracks she inflicted in the glass door looked pretty substantial--she should have kept smashing. Apparently being sprayed with icky-colored water is enough to make a grown woman give in. And since when do children boss around adults?) We see Dahlia walking off hand in hand with Natasha, as if she's decided that her separation from Ceci (and her own life) might not be so bad after all. Though she's probably vowed never to abandon her daughter, Dahlia ironically turns out to be no better than her own negligent mother.This film fails on all counts. Not scary (haunted washing machine? haunted Hello Kitty back pack?), not sweet ("whenever you need me, honey, I'll be here--the yucky drip in the elevator"), it's a sorry excuse for a story.</fullReview>

Again...don't recommend it to anyone unless you have like 10 bucks and about 2 hours you want to waste at you local movie theater. I don't think it should be worth anyones time. There are plenty of other great movies out there. You would be better off going and seeing a movie like "Fantastic Four" or "War of the Worlds". At least those movies aren't boring and have some good scenes in them. Don't go see the movie. It is a waste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen this film yet but earlier today I was watching a review that might help out for those with confusion about what Dark Water is trying to portray. The movie Dark Water is supposed to be a deep psychological thriller centering around issues of abandonment as a child. It is not supposed to be a typical horror movie but much more of a deep thinker. I will definitely see it for myself as soon as it releases here and then I suppose I will have a better picture! Has anyone seen this so far who can agree or disagree with this? P/S I am also not a very big fan of the Ring or Ring 2, I mean the ring did give me nightmares for a bit but really it wasn't all that great. I have heard that these movies are VERY similar, the Ring also was a bit of a thinker. Thanks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>as beautiful and eloquent as Dark Water looks and sounds, the story's got to pull its weight as well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dark Water Reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.comRating: 2.5 out of 4If I didn't know any better, I'd swear Dark Water had been directed by David Fincher (Fight Club, Se7en). It's dripping in so much handsomely gritty atmosphere, that Dark Water might actually work better without the dialogue. Dark water in itself isn't a frightening image. But director Walter Salles (The Motorcycle Diaries) manages to make it into a monster. The spot on the ceiling grows, breathes, and seems to organically grow. But none of this personification is shown through anything but the visuals.The film's set in Roosevelt Island, a Tram ride away from Manhattan, in an apartment complex that was originally built to be a utopia. To Salles, "utopia" is probably some sort of sick joke. The place looks like a Russian Gulag. The scene from Downfall, where papers are being destroyed at the hospital by being thrown from the windows, is most reminiscent of the set. But interestingly enough, Salles spares us the haunted house clichés. The apartment complex seems creepy, and yes, it is haunted, but we're not subjected to ham-handed creaky doors or jump-happy mirror tricks. Salles has the feel of a master storyteller. This much is apparent. Problem is, Dark Water's screenplay gives him little to tell. It opens with a flashback to the 70's, where Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) is left in the pouring rain after school by her mother. Her way to pass the time was to use an old drum toy. The one where you twist it between your hands and two strings flop around to hit a drum. The sound of the toy haunts her to present time, where we're then shown her cruel custody battle with ex-husband Kyle (Dougray Scott). Kyle wants Dahlia and their young daughter Cecilia (Ariel Gade) to move to Jersey City where he's moved. Dahlia suspects his motive for Jersey City is the girl on the side, and rebels by leasing a place on Roosevelt Island. The seller is the slimy used-car salesman-esquire Mr. Murray (John C. Reilly). Murray introduces them to the doorman/security/plumber Veeck (Pete Postlethwaite), who seems to notice something in Dahlia and her daughter. Their first night in the new apartment, the two find a water spot on the bedroom ceiling. Informing Mr. Veeke of the problem, he shoes them over to Murray, who circles them back around to Veecke, avoiding the issue. And so the creepy water spot increases. But as it grows, Dahlia hears footsteps in the floor above, where the water's coming from. Telling Mr. Murray about it, he informs her that nobody's been on the floor for six months. Suspecting it's Kyle trying to make a case for Dahlia's mental instability, she hires a cheap and lonely lawyer, Jeff Platzer (Tim Roth). Meanwhile, Ceci has conjured up an imaginary friend at her new elementary school. All these elements make up the slow-moving mystery of Dark Water.It's really dishonest to market Dark Water as a horror film. It's more on the level of The Machinist, where psychological thrills are more important than scares. The film rarely, if ever, tries to get a jump out of the audience. The screenplay takes us very far into its characters and its world and mystery, building and developing for most of the film, but never really hits full throttle. It tries to be slow and elegant, but fails in that it never picks up. Sitting in an opening night tearer packed tight with anticipating teenagers, I heard more than a few whispered complaints about how slow Dark Water was. Everybody expected The Ring. But what they got was a kind of re-hash of the same material, just done differently. It's almost a remake. Almost. But Salles gives his film something Gore Verbinski didn't: elegance. But as beautiful and eloquent as Dark Water looks and sounds, the story's got to pull its weight as well. And as American audiences are now learning, this Japanese psychological scare formula isn't working. What does work however, are the performances. I have no complaints. In particular, Ariel Gade as Dahlia's daughter and Tim Roth as the lawyer put up admirable acts. Gade has the "it" that makes child actors so lovable. Dakota Fanning has it. Freddie Highmore form Finding Neverland has it. And Ariel Gade has it. It's raw acting talent. Jennifer Connelly does well in her lead role, doing the best she can with the material. She does her concerned, lonely, and stressed mother face exceptionally well. And John C. Reilly and Pete Postlethwaite as Murray and Veecke work well as counterbalance to each other. All in all, the acting is remarkable. It was an interesting move for Walter Salles to move from foreign film to Hollywood after he struck gold with last year's The Motorcycle Diaries. The horror genre has hit its stride in popularity lately and a hit could propel any director's career. It's too bad Dark Water wasn't quite all there. Salles did the very best he could and his work will impress all who care to look for it. The real fault in Dark Water is in the story. It's fatally flawed. -Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in with lots of expectations. Though it is of the same AMITYVILLE HORROR genre of "Haunted house" movies, i was disappointed to see it was so similar to RING. Technically, the movie is good. Editing could have been sharper. But camera-work is the best part as it catches the spooky ambiance of the apartment, rainy NewYork city, the expressions of that little girl,Ariel Gade. For only her second movie, she has given a brilliant performance. Jennifer Connelly looks anemic and tired.Last one hour,i could literally visualize the movie before it came on screen and that is where the director slipped big. When a movie's last one hour becomes so predictable, it is going to flop big time. I guess it is time Hollywood stops rehashing films from Japan. Tempted to say this is the worst of the rehash-lot, but Ariel Gade saves the movie from being so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a drama with horror elements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason that so many people are disappointed with the movie is that they are going in expecting a movie that will scare the living day light out of them, when in reality it's more of a drama with horror elements.The original itself was the same, if not worse. The American remake had better execution of the script and the way it was shot. You have to admit the film is very well shot and well acted by talented actors. The original bored me to tears and i was not scared once. This remake is more watchable, simply because there is a distinct direction and a sense of style.People who've seen the original should already know it's not really a scary movie. It's just a girl who desires a family and a single loving mother who moves into a haunted apt trying to cope with her divorce and custody battle. The struggle of the mother is the main focus of the movie along with the haunted spirit from the apt.It's safe to say that the "horror elements" are just the icing on the cake to the main story. It's a hard movie to market. I think the film did the best it can with the given material. Yes, it is better than the original and i would recommend this over the original. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants to have the living day light scared out of them.The is by far one of the better remakes. If you don't like the movie, blame it on the story, because the original had the same plot. this one is just more stylized and better acted, and dare i say more enjoyable than the original.Enjoy the movie from a different point a view, the experience will be different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ghost went west</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The screenwriter of this movie says in his interview on the DVD that the original Japanese version took an Asian view of ghosts that he felt he had to "Westernize." I'm not sure what he meant by this. The ghost in the original may have looked more like a Asian movie ghost than an American movie ghost--though the latter now more often look Asian--but ghosts everywhere have the same motives, and although those in Asian stories and movies have sometimes employed unique methods of haunting, involving e.g. motile heads and eyeballs, the one in the Japanese Dark Water had no tricks that should throw a self-respecting American ghost. What the writer must have meant, I theorize after seeing the movie, is that the haunting be over-literalized and over-elaborated, a la Stephen King (the tracking down of the ghost child's family; great floods of blood), and ultimately sentimentalized, a la The Sixth Sense (the jerkwad husband suddenly turning nice; the ghost as fairy-angel), and the ghost de-ghosted: she only makes one appearance near the end, and turns out to be just a kid, a most unspectral-looking kid who sometimes screws up her face to look mean. So, not having much of the ghost, who isn't much of a ghost to start with, the movie seems to be mainly about a plumbing problem. I suspect that, truth to tell, the director had no interest in doing a ghost story at all but wanted to be remaking Rosemary's Baby (which he references more than once in his interview). The only real tension he creates isn't in the haunting scenes but in the scenes sketching the heroine's disintegrating personal life. The first few of these, and the first rainy exteriors of the apartment and its surroundings, unmanageably large and gray and intimidating, and the eerie music get the movie off to a promising start; and so do the two actresses: Jennifer Connelly, well cast as a woman laboring under life's burdens (although, since she'd played the same part in House and Sand and Fog, the choice can't be deemed a great intuitive stroke), and the girl playing her daughter, who seems completely natural. Yet with all these things going for it the movie soon starts to fall apart. For one thing, the secondary roles are over-cast: the actors impersonating the landlord, the super, and a lawyer who operates out of his car give lively, amusing performances, but every time one of them appears he turns the movie into satire and obliterates any sense of unease built up thitherto. The interiors of the apartment building don't come up (or rather, down) to the exterior: the apartment looks too pretty, and the laundry room extremely improbable and set-like: if any of the filmmakers had ever sat in a drab laundry room, they would have known how scary they can be without trying. Finally, the movie eliminates the two best scenes from the original movie: the climax, certainly one of the most frightening scenes in any ghost movie (which any director who had really been out to make one would have been champing at the bit to do his way), and the last scene, inevitable but inescapable, which here is stood on its head, like a sad mouth upturned into a smile, for a sentimental cheer-bite that not only defangs but contradicts the entire preceding story. The first movie immersed you in Dark Water; this one, they should have called just Water.</fullReview>

Once they move into the apt., strange things happen, and they discover a ghost.Just to let you know, this movie was more drama, physcoligical, then horror. It had parts where you'd jump in your seat, and many parts of it were well thought out.I very much liked the ending, a little sad and happy. Dalia dying for her own daughter is pure sacrifice, and I think this is the major message of the story. I thought that the last part of Dalia saying, "Ill always be there for you..." touched my heart. It gave you thought.Overall, the movie was good.</fullReview>

So then this new Japanse horror-American rehash comes out. I expect some good scares. Things that might give me some trouble sleeping. You know the deal. Bad assumption on my part. To the movie's credit, the music and sound are very well done. Jennifer acts well, she is just in the wrong flick. They give you enough information by the middle of the film to figure out the "secret" so the second half is pretty much a paint-by-numbers ghost story. The twist at the end is weak, and only reinforces the idea that when you become a ghost, your sole mission is to stay in one location and be a tool to anyone who happens to encounter the scene of the crime against you. Gets old really quick if you ask me, just play Fatal Frame III and you'll see what I mean. I really enjoy horror movies, but this is in fact not a horror film. It is horribly boring. The cinematography is well-done, but as Hannibal teaches us, good camera work can't make up for a bad movie.</fullReview>

To further complicate things, her apartment has a leak in the ceiling that is spewing forth dark water, and her daughter has a new playmate who may or may not be imaginary.One of the best things about this movie is how good it is at setting mood. Even in the brightest of spots, everything still feels oppressive, and almost every character seems as if they have ulterior motives. Some not so great things about this movie are that it moves slowly, plots are hinted at, but never fully developed, and the ending almost seems like a quasi rip-off of Poltergeist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark Water ...Dark , Wet Theme ...Dark, Wet Sets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How far would you go to protect your child? We often hear parents say that they'd die for them, but dying is only going so far. What would you be willing to endure in the afterlife for your child ...and perhaps someone else's kid?In DARK WATER, directed by Walter Salles and starring Jennifer Connelly, we get to see exactly how far a damaged mother will go for her child. Dahlia (Connelly) is going through a bitter divorce and custody battle. For her job's sake, Dahlia is forced to move outside the hub of New York City and into a dark, dank apartment complex on Roosevelt Island. With her comes her daughter, Ceci, a ten-year-old with a perceptive extrasensory ability. Or does she have that ability? As soon as they enter the apartment complex, Ceci begins to feel poorly and asks to leave, but her mother insists that they check out the apartment. They soon move in and stranger things begin happening: dark water drips from the ceiling, Dahlia sees her mother (who'd abandoned her) in strange dreams, Ceci talks to an imaginary friend named Natasha, and the elevator button for their floor (#9) is burned or damaged. As the plot unfolds, we learn that the neighbors directly above Dahlia and Ceci's apartment were Russian immigrants who had a child, but neither the child nor the parents have been seen in some time. Did something foul happen to them? Further research by Dahlia's divorce attorney (played by Tim Roth ) shows that the adults from the upstairs apartment are separated and living apart ...but neither of them have their daughter, who's name happens to be Natasha. Where is she? Is she the same Natasha that Ceci talks to in her imagination? Are Ceci and Natasha somehow connected with the dark water dripping from their ceiling?The tone and dark, wet scenes set the stage for DARK WATER in a very revealing fashion. Water plays a vital part of how the viewer perceives much of what is shown on-screen, giving the entire production a rather somber (if downright depressing) feel. This is the prime strength of the movie, getting us into how Jennifer Connelly's character feels and why she reacts the way she does (especially after seeing her as a young girl in the opening scenes, waiting for her negligent mother to come and get her from school ...and again, it's raining). Much has been said about this film regarding how much was intended to be psychological versus supernatural. But for me, it was all supernatural. The only part the psychology of Connelly's character played in the film was, again, helping set the tone and as a method for one ghostly apparition to feed off of. If Ceci (the daughter) can see the ghost, then it's not a psychological breakdown on her mother's part. Comparisons between THE RING and THE GRUDGE are pretty obvious, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the film. But it did make me wonder about how many other thriller films out there are using the same format now. How about something original guys?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Movie But Lots Of Loose Ends</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the movie was pretty good, actually. It was scary and suspenseful enough, but there were many loose ends, and I didn't understand why they were even brought into the film. What was the point of the attorney working out of his car? Why did he mention being with family when he wasn't? I understand that he was being made out as an unsuccessful loser, but it had nothing whatsoever to do with anything. What exactly happened to her as a child? They sort of explained it through flashbacks but since it was such a huge part of what was going on, it should have been explained better. Did her husband put the teens up to something after all? That storyline was brought up for no apparent reason and went absolutely nowhere. All of those things seemed to be a big part of the story and were never explained. I left the movie feeling cheated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is a film that does not break any new ground, covers familiar terrain yet is convincing due primarily to the terrific performances. Jennifer Connelly can play wounded and vulnerable women with the best of them, and the rest of the cast (excepting Tim Roth in a subplot that goes nowhere) are also first rate. The themes explored have been seen countless times but you do grow to care about these characters. Walter Salle's directing is deliberately paced, the film doesn't find it necessary to throw in a cheap scare every 5 minutes. The final scene is effectively ambiguous. This is better than your run of the mill thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so excited to hear that they were making a remake of Dark Water... why? Because I felt Dark Water could have been much more creepier and scarier... Now let me say, this remake is very disappointing. Everything that was creepy in the original was missing in the remake. The only thing that I liked about the new version was the acting... the acting was pretty much top notch. I'm not going to give anything away, but seeing Tim Roth, John C. Reilly, and Pete Postlethwaite on screen is excellent. All amazing actors... and Jennifer Connelly is just breathe-taking.But the movie was suppose to be a horror / suspense movie... but everything was given away, there was no mystery in this film. Totally opposite from the original. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dark Water is great at manufacturing tension using a contemporary project (apartment) complex as the source of shadows, dim and yellow light, strange noises, and black-colored water. The tension is level almost from the beginning of the movie until the end, and rarely is there a scary moment to break it. Even the comic relief of the daughter is unintentional as she plays with her toys in the bathtub -- although she steals this scene, it is due to her personality, not the script.This film is largely plot less. It's also not entirely a character sketch, as many plot less movies can be. For a horror movie to be a character sketch is risky and quite interesting. For a horror movie to have no plot is downright suicidal. The movie fails mostly because it lacks a believable sequence of events. The relationships between the characters are well-developed and the cast is quite good, but there's nothing for them to do. Look scared, be scary, but why? And the utter non-ending is truly thoughtless -- the film ultimately has no regard for the audience.I suspect that much of the problem has to do with translation. Not Japanese to English, but rather Japanese sensibility to Hollywood sensibility. Something is missing here, a finger on something important. After all, the best horror movies are about our worst fears. Who is afraid of dark water stains?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the midst of a bitter divorce, Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) decides to move into Roosevelt Island and rents a worn down apartment with her daughter, Cece in tow. Cece starts to have an 'imaginary. friend as well as Dahlia having reoccurring nightmares. This, along with other certain peculiarities about her apartment leads Dahlia on path of curiosity hoping to find answers to certain questions. John C. Rielly as Mr. Murphy, the real estate agent who sells her on the shady new living quarters she finds herself in is easily the best thing this movie has going for it. As for anyone who saw Hideo Nakata's "Honogurai mizu no soko kara", you'd do well to just avoid this pale Americanized remake all together. As it lacks anything close to the scares, tension, or creepy atmosphere that the original had. A failure on nearly all accounts.My Grade: DWhere I Saw it: Starz on Demand</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark Water - excellent, subtle, but mis-marketed thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>{Spoilers} When I saw Dark Water I was unaware of two important things: 1. It's a remake of a Japanese movie that I haven't seen, and 2. It's not a horror thriller. I figured out the second one out about a third of the way through, and only realized the first one at the closing credits. However, by then it was clear that this is a rare, subtle, and carefully made film that, like many other well-made films, is not at all about what it appears to be. The plot is simple to the point of almost not being there: Dahlia, who is going through a divorce, together with her daughter Ceci, moves into a rundown apartment building which is as ugly as it is non-functional. The reality of her situation, the day-to-day grind of trying to make her life work in the face of ordinary but soul-deadening obstacles (leaks in the ceiling, hassling with punk teenagers, laundromat machines that break down, the constant rain) starts to combine with the inner problems she has experienced all her life (being abandoned as a child, possible mental instability, perhaps paranoia, migraines) and are just emphasized by the lack of cooperation from the building maintenance man, the apartment manager and her soon-to-be ex-husband. Soon her daughter seems to develop a sinister relationship with an imaginary friend, the apartment upstairs starts to develop a degree of malevolence all of its own, and her depression and anxiety start to spin out of control. Does she "really" see the face of a lost little girl in the washing machine glass? - does she "really" hear the voice of Natasha from upstairs? is she having nightmares or is something or someone trying to communicate with her? Who is her daughter's "imaginary" friend? And - tellingly - when we see the face of the (ghost?) little girl in the photo, why is it the face of the young Dahlia at the beginning of the picture?In the end, this is a film about grief, about love and our need for it, and, at the end, even about a kind of redemption. It's far from your usual slasher flick, and, playing fair, it lets you know pretty early on by almost totally refusing to give you "jump-out-of-your-skin" moments. (Similarly, "The Wedding Crashers" was billed as a comedy, and let us know it wasn't early on by refusing to give us any really funny moments). Twice, for example, Dahlia (played with exquisite focus by Jennifer Connelly) takes a headache pill, and shuts the mirrored medicine cabinet door and we see her reflection; horror movie convention dictates that we should see a face or a monster behind her, but there's nothing scary in the scene - no "shocker" moment. Again, when a discovery is made in the water tank, one expects a shocking "eyes-suddenly-open" moment, with a sudden burst of music and, maybe, a strobe light. Nothing. There are two cheapie "boo!" moments, but every other opportunity is passed by (somewhat to the disappointment of other reviewers here and in the papers).Speaking of Jennifer Connelly, she gives an exquisite performance. It's easy to portray stark fear; it's another thing entirely to get across just plain ordinary emotional and physical stress growing slowly to an unraveling; in this way the movie is similar to the book (not the movie) The Shining, in which the main character becomes more and more affected before your eyes, and is partially aware that it's happening, and why, but can't seem do anything about it. Near the end, you can see that Dahlia is holding it together by sheer force of will, but she just has nothing left.I haven't seen the original Japanese movie of which this is a remake, but it appears to be very highly regarded. It makes sense that this is originally a Japanese story; there seems to be a difference in the way that they characterize ghosts and our relationship with the spirit world. The symbolism of the title entity ("Dark Water") alone is something one wouldn't find in most Western horror or thriller pictures. All in all, this is, strangely enough, a haunting (appropriate adjective) and emotional film that works (if you let it) due to the atmosphere, the performances and the writing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is sad. I've read the "hated it" reviews of this film. Most of them seem to be centered around two main themes. The first was "This movie was too slow/not gory/not violent." Hey, guess what? The old Universal films from the 30's and 40's were not overly violent, not gory, had no nudity, and were not fast-paced at all. Are you going to say Bride of Frankenstein sucked? The other school of Dark-Water-sucking-related thought seemed to be "the movie is a total rip-off of the original/The Ring/The Ring 2/blah blah blah." Look, I'm only gonna say this once: THIS IS A DIFFERENT MOVIE THAN THE ORIGINAL!!! If you can't judge a movie on its own merits, you have no business reviewing said movie. And I defy you to find one movie made after 1950 that isn't like some other.Oh, and the whole "it wasn't scary" thing? I'm sorry, I missed the part where a movie had to be scary in order to be good. True, most non-scary movies weren't marketed as such, but when I watch a film, I tend not to judge it by the previews, and instead on, call me crazy, THE ACTUAL MOVIE! Now, with that gripe out of the way, on with the review.I was pleasantly surprised by this film. After hearing about how bad it was supposed to be, I happily discovered that this film is, in fact, well-acted, well-written, well-directed, and brilliantly suspenseful.For those who plan to watch this movie, here's some advice: if you're going to hate the movie, do it because there is something wrong with the movie itself. Judge the movie on its own merits, or don't waste board space complaining about how it wasn't like a different movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dark, eerie, swirling with lurking danger, this movie is a ten only if you're about 13. Jennifer Connelly is fantastic as the possibly mentally disturbed mother. Ariel Gade is perhaps the best child actor I have ever seen. The cinematography is fantastic. The only real problem with this film is that, for those of us who have been around the block, the plot is just too predictable. Even the surprise twist at the end does not overcome the predictability.That said, though the movie deserves a 6, I gave it a ten for one redeeming factor that I have not seen in any other movie. The parents, battling for custody, see the effect the conflict is having on their child and call it (the ongoing battle) quits. That message is worth a ten by itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I keep coming back to this genre in hopes of something new. Or if not new, then at least the old delivered competently. The genre is simply characterized: the haunted house movie.Now in these things there are ghosts and stories about ghosts of course. But the chief character is the building itself.There's a cinematic reason for this which I think is related to the great American invention of noir. The essence of noir is that our hapless characters enter a world of capricious fate where events seem orchestrated to jerk them around.The haunted house movie is related in being a localization and sometimes personification of that environment. When I enter these films ? as the characters enter these buildings ? we enter a world that is not just haunted, but haunted by forces of cinema. Its a very strange feeling that has little to do with fear of the dark. Its fear of having our own (cinematic) imagination get out of control. "The Shining" is perhaps the best constructed if these, but I'm partial to "Liebestraum" too.There are so many of these, and they'll surprise you sometimes. "The Attic Expeditions."In this case, we have many of the ordinary elements: dreams, visions, reinvented pasts, loss. What's slightly different here is the image of creeping dark water, fluid noir that saturates.And that takes me to my main point, about the national character of the filmmaker.Cultures really do have cinematic stances. Czech films are buttery and Polish ones lacy. French ones bogged down in trivial self-reference from three generations back. Italians chew the sense of character.Thank god for Australians and Canadians and their clarity. But the soul of richness right now, all the advances in how we imagine is in the hands of our Spanish and Spanish-speaking filmmakers who suspend layered worlds before us. And it doesn't seem to matter all that much if they live in Spain, Mexico, Hollywood or France. We depend on them.Its a blunt observation and practically useless, like all obvious truths.So, I am asked whether this extends to Portuguese, which includes Brazil. Actually, there are lots of nice things to say about Brazil, its music and energy. But not about its films, and I don't know why.Salles (director of this mundane outing) and Meirelles (who has music and understands pacing) are the two apparent leaders in Brazilian film. They are, simply Italian in their sensibilities, and this can be seen as a mere giallo with no guts.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless remake- why not call it Ring 3?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the cast list for "Dark Water", I thought that it was a little odd but promising. I mean really, how many Oscar nominated let alone winners, would do a re-make? The original version, released in 2002 was called, Honogurai mizu no soko kara. Although I suppose as soon as one saw that Koji Suzuki wrote the novel this movie was based on, as well as the novel that was made into "Ringu" and it's US counterparts, they could assume they knew the story. "Dark Water" is yet another movie in the current trend of casting children as our link to the dead. All it takes is an "imaginary friend" and some creepy toys or drawings and you've got yourself a horror movie people will go see. Well now I can say I won't be one of them. Jennifer Connelly, in her role as Dahlia, does yet another great job as a downtrodden and weary woman, much like the way she spent half of "House of Sand and Fog". Perhaps that explains her reason for choosing such an apartment complex for her and her daughter and her ability to accept leaks and loud noises coming from the empty apartment above. John C. Riley does a wonderful job portraying the sleazy cheap landlord/ building manager and Pete Postlethwaite as Veeck gave the audience yet another colorful player that further went to questioning Dahlia's mental state in choosing her home. In all honesty, no person would put up with the people and the building as much as the writer and director would have us believe. To me, the most enjoyable thing to watch was young Ariel Gade as Connelly's daughter Ceci. The two of them interacting made up the only believable part of the storyline.In my view, if you've seen "The Ring", you've seen "Dark Water". Mother and child meets abandonment. Perhaps Mr. Koji Suzuki should go see a therapist to deal with his mother issues instead of plaguing us with another tale that so formulaic.</fullReview>

The kid was great, I give you that, but I can go to a PTA meeting if I want to see cute kids. I at least expected to see a world class beauty in all her subtle glory but this movie disappointed equally on all levels. More on her in a moment. I can understand a bit of misdirection in this crass age of scrambling for the next sleeper hit, but one can only endure so much. A dream sequence here, the sudden appearance of a new character there, a dash of dream sequence within dream sequence ("how daring", the director thought as he breathlessly watched the editor do his bidding...), flashbacks, partial flashbacks, halllucinations &amp; imaginary friends who might have been real if only...plot half-truths, unfinished thoughts...One's disbelief can only take so much suspension before one ceases to care. I believe my disbelief actually committed willing suspension off one of those water towers or water pipes or water vistas just over halfway through the movie. I ceased to care who was which, who was right, who was crazy, what was real, or whether or not I would ever get to see even a silhouette outline of Ms. Connelly's figure. The dark, seedy lighting could have worked in a Wes Craven movie or a B flick with no pretensions of Connelly, but to waste talent so flagrantly makes me agree with some of my female friends who pointed it out long ago and who I always assumed were just jealous: Ms. Connelly does seem to make poor choices. I actually shut this movie off before I saw any credits roll because I realized then that I could at least hold out the hope that the movie somehow tied itself together after I quit watching, and that the fault was mine. And I also believe that Ms. Connelly may read this review and contact me with the news that she has left her hubby and is interested in meeting me. A Big, well-deserved "1".</fullReview>

If you were at all scared in this movie, you need to start licking some 9 volt batteries and get some excitement in your life. If you found yourself shedding a tear in this movie, you need to slap yourself. The movie is extremely predictable in every aspect. I think the reason people enjoyed the ring is because it was something new and unexpected in horror movies. "She never sleeps"... that line still creeps me out. The only creepy line this movie offers you is "will you be my mommy?" Oh my god, I'm going to wet myself.</fullReview>

The theater I was in was full when we went in, and about 3/4 empty before the movie was over. This is definitely not "summers next big horror movie".

Man, Dark Water made me very angry. I left the theater without saying a word. Very disappointed. They should have just followed the original story line. Showing the Japanases version in the theater would have been a lot better. I just hope people go rent the Japanese version instead of going to the theater and catch Dark Water.</fullReview>

In Dark Water, however, at the end we are wondering why we watched this woman suffer with her husband, the building owner, the two boys in the apartment... why did we spend time watching the lawyer, the husband, the boys, the teacher, etc. for such an abrupt ending with no answers, nothing to tie any of it all together. A great movie leaves you thinking and figuring out how everything goes so well together... this movie left the audience booing and several people walking out. For such a long buildup and feeling of sympathy created for Jennifer Connely's character, one would hope it would add up to more than 10 minutes of nothing. However, I have to say I did get a good laugh out of Natasha being in the bathtub wearing a sweater and having this constipated look on her face... All in all, I walked out wanting my 8 dollars back and some answers as to why Jennifer Connelly chose to be in this movie... please save your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ugh... awful remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw Dark Water with Jennifer Connelly and I have to say that I am terribly disappointed with this remake. Does the director think that the audience consists of mindless middle school students that can't put together a story without spelling out every single detail? While the Japanese original was very subtle and emotional, I believe the remake simply was never able to build up the same kind of atmosphere. The mother's sacrifice in the Japanese version is much more believable and authentic, while the remake relies too heavily on cheap thrills. What also aggravated me was that the little-girl-in-distress theme was used constantly and unrelentingly throughout the whole freakin movie, I don't need to be told over and over about her so-called psychological condition, jeez. I just hope that future remakes of Asian movies aren't brutally mocked by sub-par remakes. For now I'm just praying that the director of the upcoming Tale of Two Sisters remake doesn't cast Lindsay Lohan and Hillary Duff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hmmmm...lets see...there's not much to say other than there's not much worse than this. There probably is worse, but you do have to go into the 5 cents bucket at a movie store to find them. This movie was pointless; there was no real plot, it wasn't scary at all, and it just was horrible. The title of the movie pretty much sums it up, it is literally about dark water. That's it. Water that is dark. There's no villain, no suspense, no crazy twist at the end, nothing, just dark water. I almost walked out into the lobby to sit out there. That would probably have been more exciting then sitting through that. So i definitely recommend not to see this movie, unless you wanna pay 7 bucks for a 2 hour nap. Well thats what i think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i can't believe they remade another Japanese original....AGAIN!! Can't Hollywood think of any of their own ideas? At least they could screen the originals majorly when they're released in the home country! This film was a load of bull. I booed the screen when it ended because i am now soooo frustrated with these terrible remakes. The Ring directed by Gore Verbinski was okay because he totally changed the plot from Hideo Nakata's version as well as Koji Suzuki's book. The Grudge well that was practically the Japanese version but with American actors and English dialect. This is a disgrace. Hideo Nakata's film is a lot better. DON'T SEE THIS FILM. But if you do, please boo before it comes on- we must support the originals and not the daft remakes!!! p.s. i have also heard that remakes of Korean genius film 'A Tale of Two Sisters' is being remade as well as 'Battle Royale' and 'The Eye'.

		<fullReview>I cannot figure why the trend to re-make another Japanese horror flick. Okay, The Ring was good, Ring 2 okay, but the trend is getting ridiculous. I give Dark Water a 2, only, because Jennifer Connelly is a good actress, otherwise the film should have been named Shallow Water. The plot has no depth, the threat is minimal, and the characters are depressing. Has the film industry forgotten how to create a good horror flick that they have to borrow movies from other countries? And they are not even that great of movie. I know I own some of them. Recently, I heard that once again they are coming out with another re-make, this one called The Ghost. I can only imagine. My girl friend after viewing Dark Water, looked over at me and said, "Do you think I could get a refund on the last two hours of my life?" I think it's time to step up to the plate and start putting out some quality horror/supernatural films. Jennifer Connelly, we love you, but the film stinks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very disappointed in this one, considering I had once been told that the Japanese version of this is actually better than the Japanese version of "The Ring". I just don't see that being the case unless we totally reworked the movie into something completely different and very very boring. There is really nothing to this movie, in the end there are no real surprises what you think is what you get and it plays more like a movie about child custody set against the backdrop of a haunted apartment complex. I do not blame the cast, as they all did a good job, but sometimes a movie is just bad for other reasons such as story, lack of mood, and no real scares considering this is supposed to be horror. Actually, I can now see why this movie is listed as a drama first, thriller second, and lastly a horror. In fact, they should just drop the horror part. The story, mother moves into a very unattractive apartment complex on an island in New York while in the midst of said custody battle. Water drips from the ceiling in the bed room and seems to be originating from the upstairs apartment. Could be rowdy kids pulling a prank or something on a more supernatural note, but this does not help the mother as she starts questioning her sanity. Throw in a few scenes of a ghost that almost seem not to belong in this film and you have your movie. You may want to check it out if you like a really mild thriller, but otherwise if you are looking for scares, alas there are very few of them (actually I would say there are none) I would avoid this movie and wait for the next Japanese horror turned American remake or see something of ours that isn't rated pg-13 and can put ya to sleep. Though if you do go and you do fall asleep, just ask the person next to you what you missed and they will probably tell you "Absolutely nothing".And on a side note, don't vote yes or no on my review of this movie unless you have not seen it and this review proved helpful or not helpful in you deciding to see it, because that is what it asks not whether you agree with it or disagree like so many people seem to think it says.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There does not exist, as far as I am aware, the word "Meh." This is a shame, because it exactly describes my reaction at the end of this film.I must start by saying that I didn't see the Japanese original and I didn't see the advertising - I just started watching the movie on broadcast TV. It quickly became clear that it was teasing the audience - "Am I a horror film? I might be, you know. Or a ghost story? Or am I a portrait of a woman with a history of mental problems, cracking up under intolerable strain? Then again, I might be a psychological thriller about a husband trying to make his wife look as if she's going mad so that he can get custody of the daughter. Hee hee hee, aren't I naughty, not letting you on as to exactly what I am!" Thing is, as the film strolled in fairly languid style to its improbable and unexplained conclusion, I found it hard to care. All the performances were good (excepting only the great Pete Postlethwaite, who fell somewhat short of his usual standard of excellence), but I was never, ever engaged enough to get worked up about the fact that the ending came pretty much out of nowhere. Had I been engaged, I would have felt cheated. As it was, I felt - "Meh."Had I been Jennifer Connelly, I would have been on the phone to my agent, saying, "Don't you ever send me anything like this again!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How is this even an horror?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can this movie be even regarded an horror movie? It lacks some serious tension and scares and even though this movie is made in a typical horror movie style, this just is no horror movie. This was a real disappointing thing to me and definitely surely more was to be expected from a movie based on a Japanese horror movie, that however, as it seems, is just as much of a lackluster as this movie is.This movie jumps all over the place with its story. The one moment it's some pure drama and the other it tries to include some horror elements but it just never pushed through. It's like they trying to head into a certain direction at times but then suddenly stop and say; 'Nah, this is not going to work, let's try something else now'. It to me made this a pretty inconsistent movie to watch. Also the story its time-line and the way it progressed just didn't seemed right to me. The movie at times makes some sudden jumps with its scenes and it often feels like 2 or 3 scenes are missing from the movie at times. It really doesn't makes this movie a satisfying one to watch.But no, I still can't rate this movie really low, since it's definitely a good looking one with also some great actors in it. Even though it's a real lackluster, it's not a movie I hated watching or anything. The movie just left me hungry for more all the time, for something that just never came. The movie is like one big build up to absolutely nothing.It's fair enough to say that the actors are the ones that keep your interested throughout. Jennifer Connelly is a true great, already Oscar winning, actress. But also the supporting cast seems pretty amazing, considering the type of movie this one is. It features acclaimed actors such as John C. Reilly, Tim Roth, Dougray Scott, Pete Postlethwaite and Camryn Manheim in its supporting cast. A cast most in Hollywood would be jealous about.So this is not really an horror, does that mean that this movie should be regarded as just merely a drama? I don't think so. As a drama this movie in its core might be solid but with all of those 'supernatural' elements thrown in, you just can't really regard this movie as a serious drama attempt. The movie got also made too much into a typical distinctive horror movie style for that.A good looking movies that follows all of the usual Japanese horror remake steps but only forgets about its tension and scares. I even prefer "The Grudge" over this, at least that one had still horror elements in it.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am glad I didn't have to pay to see Dark Water. I got a huge disappointment watching it. It's not bad but I was expecting a HORROR movie! The trailers are probably the most lying ones I have ever seen. This movie was marketed as horror and surprise, surprise, it is a drama with a pinch of "ghost" salt. That's why I rated 2 out of 10. I hate to be sold a pig on a poke.Other than that the pace is VERY slow, there are no thrills at all. Since it was marketed as horror you expect a jump throughout the movie. Well, the only jump is in the last 10 minutes. Also there are TOO MANY similarities with The Ring, and it seems they had a problem with the editor: Almost every scene has it sound 5 seconds forwarded and there are plenty of short and quick cuts that gave me headaches. The movie is also quite predictable.OK, not everything was bad. The atmosphere was intense (it reminded me the atmosphere you got in Seven, based on stormy and cloudy weather) and very good acting with Ariel Gade almost outshining Jennifer Connelly. I have to mention that Perla Haney-Jardine portraying the Young Dahlia was a terrible miscast. She doesn't look one bit like Jennifer Connelly. And by the way, I am tired of creepy kids in movies. Give it a break!The story was OK. The plot is a little screwed up because Jennifer character's own demons are mixed with the story of the girl's ghost who haunted her and her kid, so that is very confusing. Also the ending was frustrating and depressing but it's well done.If you are looking for horror, this is not the movie. Now if you would like to watch a drama with a bit of a ghost story, go ahead, but be prepared for the depressing feeling you will left.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is like The Ring except with black water, wooo scary. I'm so sick and tired of movies w/ neglectful parents who don't want their child so the simplest answer is to ignore or kill them and in this instance both drowned. So now this revengeful dead little bitch wants revenge and tries to make the living girls mother her mother, hmm doesn't sound like The Ring 2 to me. SO through the entire movie Natasha tortures the mother w/ a leaky ceiling, god I know I would go insane to if my ceiling kept leaking, until the point the mother just snaps. Movies with dead little girls pissing others off with water is getting quite annoying and makes me not want to swim or even take a shower anymore because watching 2 hours of water torture is not my cup of horror/mystery movies. The only difference between Dark Water and The Ring is that there was a father present in Dark Water and there was a boy instead of a girl in The Ring. Please Hollywood, get some new ideas and stop recycling crap and stealing stuff from Japan, lord knows i'm tired of the dead drowned kid in The Grudge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horror movies should be horror movies. Human Drama movies should be Human Drama movies. Some movies can be both. One could argue that Poltergeist is as much about the love of family as it is about the supernatural. And it is effective. But this movie (Dark Water)is ineffective as both a human drama and as a supernatural film. People that suggest that anyone who doesn't like this film are emo kids with no adult tastes are behaving like patronizing idiots. The fact is that the film is poorly done. The audience spends the time waiting for the payoff in the fight between the mother/little girl and the ghost but when it comes it is just a silly unsatisfying blip. No sense of rising tension to crescendo. Little extraneous details are put in the film for no reason - like the lawyer pretending to have a family but really being alone. There is an implication that the husband is trying to get young kids to gaslight the Connelly character that is abandoned. It's all just earmarks of a poor film.As for the "human drama bit" - parents in custody battle. love of children. stress as a single parent. These ideas have been explored very effectively in many many films both serious and humorous - and yes - even horrific - with far better scripts.If you like this film - great. Glad you enjoyed it. But stop insulting people who didn't like it as if you're the mother of the guy who wrote the damn thing.(and I haven't seen the Japanese original so I cant compare this one to that one.)</fullReview>

This movie was awful, and I strongly recommend any of a number of intelligent horror/ghost movies before spending any time with this crapfest.

The film is incredibly predictable to the point that you could go in for the first ten minutes and leave until the final 10 minutes only to see what you already knew would happen.Following the decline of Japanese remakes, starting with the ring, these films have gotten worse and worse, leading to this pitiful excuse for a film.

There is one possibility for a worse movie of all time, Dark Water without beautiful Jennifer Connely in it. This was worse then The Patriot(Steven Segal version), which was up until now, the worst movie ever. I don't know what to do I am so upset after seeing this. I want to write a local congressman but I do not know if that will get me anywhere. I am a worse person after seeing this movie and it affected my life in a negative way. I am not mad solely for the time wasted on it, its much deeper then that. This movie should be renamed "The Leak". After I saw this movie I could have sworn I'd seen it before. Those times I believe it was called, The Ring, The Ring 2, Ringu, The Grudge, Hide and Seek, and The Sixth Sense. I know I'm delving into no new concepts of criticism here, but it is true. This movie ruined my life it was so bad, my pain is constant and sharp, and now I hope a better world for no one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie when I heard it was from the creator of The Ring and considering how good that movie was. I was expecting to see the very same result, but it turns out to be a very big misunderstanding.Jennifer Connelly plays this mother who is currently going through a divorce, and looks for a place to live. The mother and her daughter move in this apartment and finds a leak from the ceiling from the apartment above.The scenes in the movie were very scary, which I give thumbs up too, but it didn't have the behind the back type scares like "The Ring" had and I left the theater with a little bit disappointed. Besides Jennifer Connelly's performance this movie was not much of horror movie, but I do give it partial thumbs up for trying...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I lost 2 hours of my life!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the worst films I have ever seen. Everyone should have been on edge and wriggling about in their seat with fear, instead everyone was moving around with sheer boredom. I have not been in a film where over half the audience went to the toilet during the film. The film had no foul language, but after this film and during you could hear more 18/R rated words and foul language than any Mafia films combined coming from the audience and not the film.You don't jump once, there are no spooky shocks in the film. So its no thriller or horror or anything anywhere near come to think of it. *Possibly a spoiler* (depends on your own opinion of a spoiler) During the film she takes a pill and wakes up 24 hours later losing a whole day. I wish they have served these type of pills with the popcorn then I could have woke up and lost 2 hours of my life in a less painful manner.If you want an film where you can sit on the back row with your girlfriend/boyfriend and get some kissing action without worrying you will miss a good film. Then this is the perfect film for you!Just keep repeating this film over and over in any terrorist interrogation and they will be talking in minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worth it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is good for those who like rain or thunderstorms. The movie was actually not worth seeing. No real plot, bad acting, bad editing, and pointless. The apartment setting could have really saved the movie, but it remained unclear what the directors wanted us to do-that is- to be scared stiff, or to see the movie as a (family) drama. In addition the whole separation "thingy" only added length to the movie as opposed to aiding the overall plot. Many parts of the movie were very predictable, with many plots already presented during the promotion of the film. In addition, the acting is very unoriginal, as many themes in the movie could be found in the Ring, Darkness Falls, to name a few.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, i was ready to gouge out my eyes after watching this horrible movie. The plot was almost not there. There is absolutely nothing scary about dark water. I really wish that Hollywood would stop trying to re-make Japanese thrillers. Even if i have to read subtitles, it is still better. You loose so much in the translation of the story. I have officially made myself a personal promise that i WILL NOT see another horror/thriller movie in the movie theaters. This isn't the first horror/thriller movie that i have been cheated out of my hard earned money to watch. The only thing that was somewhat good about this movie was the little girls acting. She was adorable. And another thing that bugged me was that they portrayed every man in this movie to be a liar and a complete a-hole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was just bad. Its so bad that its not even funny. Its a well made bad movie. There is no fear. There is no horror. There is pretty much nothing but boredom. It takes a tired genre and just repeats everything that has been done before, but much more lame. I mean how scary can water be? Seriously! I haven't seen the original Dark Water my self, but I am so confused as why if it was good enough to remake, why not just release the original in theatres. The movie was like tofu, bland, and without substance. It may look neat at first, but after the first bite you regret buying it. I think the best scene was her in the laundry room. It was a riot. I seriously connected with her situation. I have been scared to death doing laundry myself. And that face in the machine. Wow. I don't know why I am writing this comment, being the movie isn't even worth this many words, guess I'm bored, I'm going to fix my brain and watch Daredevil.</fullReview>

The ending was horrible she goes with the ghost and leaves her daughter with the father after their little custody battle. At least the acting was good. A slap in the face for horror movies. Stop remaking Asian horror movies if it wasn't scary there why would it be here. Why did yall give it a average rating when we all can clearly see it is below average movie.

		<fullReview>I spent two hours watching Jennifer Connelly getting dripped on and hugging her daughter. Then I woke up. Dark Water should be flushed down the toilet where it belongs. Oh, that's right. They did that in the movie too!When is Hollywood going to come up with something better than this? Jennifer Connelly is a fine actress with absolutely nothing to do in this soppy mess. Funerals are more fun than this film. If you're thinking about seeing this film, save your money! If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie.Hollywood needs to wake up. People want to see quality, entertaining films! Big name stars and enormous amounts of CGI do not make a great film! Ticket revenues will continue to decline until decent films are made. I just hope that theaters don't go the way of the drive-in. Maybe it's time to re-release instead of remake? I would pay to see a classic black &amp; white film on the big screen instead of some of the stuff that's been coming out the past few years. How about anyone else?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was one of the biggest wastes of 2 hours I've ever been a part of. It has a very, very, very slow pace and eventually builds up to, well, nothing. It was pointless. There was no reason to or for this movie. If it wasn't for Jennifer Connelly, John C. Reilly, and Tim Roth actually acting pretty well, this movie might be the worst I've ever seen. But Jennifer Connelly's character was similar to the one in House of Sand and Fog, and that was a much better movie.I rate this up there with Hudson Hawk as one of the stupidest and worst movies I've ever seen. It made The Ring and Grudge seem like masterpieces. It wasn't scary, barely suspenseful in only a couple small parts, and was completely unfulfilling.We saw it early on opening day with only about 20-25 other people, and it seemed from comments that everyone else had the same opinion, as everyone left feeling they had been robbed and just wasted 2 hours of their lives that they can't get back. The theater even gave us readmission tickets to see another movie because we all felt so strongly about it sucking A$$, but we still feel slighted, even with the chance to see another movie.Conclusion is this, the movie was HORRIBLE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I re-registered just to comment on this movie which stole almost 2 hours of my life which I will never get back.I went to the theaters about 2 months after this came out with a friend. After the 20 minutes of pain...otherwise know as " great atmosphere" we were about to forget we paid and just leave...no let's stay and hope the ending redeems itself...it didn't.I am a married man with a daughter and not some random teen who cares not for depth in movies. I love Japanese culture and their movies, and have watched more TV Tokyo then I care to imagine.But enough with wannabe scary water movies, this is the least horrifying movie of them all. Except I was horrified the end did NOT redeem itself.I'm not a cheap hack n slash, or surprise scare horror fanatic.I would much rather watch a Hitchcock or read a Steven King novel then see Saw4 ( god when will they stop)...This movie is NOT about scaring you. It's not about " how a single mom goes on" It's not to show the unforgiven tale of a lost soul.What it is-a creation from the man who wrote Ring and his obsessed with Water and vengeful spirits.This American version has a mediocre script, decent acting , and way too much wet atmosphere that will drown you before you finish watching the film.I've convinced my wife for the past years not to see it and she says " I'll just watch it to see what happens."That is the problem people...nothing is what happens</fullReview>

The movie is 85 minutes of pointless talk and build up when every one knows that the missing girl is in the water tower. The last 10 or so minutes is the only thing that is enjoyable, and that is just because Jennifer Connelly's character gets killed by the ghostly figure "Natasha." The comments on the front of the DVD are "Even Hitchcock could not have done better." this is a blatant slap in the face of any true horror fan.

		<fullReview>this movie was atrocious. the character development and the momentum with which the story unfolded was terrible. i felt no emotional attachment toward any of the characters. It seemed like a ripoff of the Ring and the female lead actor (whom i am not familiar with) seemed too much like a Naomi Watts wannabe. Same make up, same style, same facial expressions, same mannerisms, etc. I barely jumped, and if I'm shallow for wanting pure horror, the psychological drama was mundane and unexciting. While watching this overrated movie, I kept feeling like I was waiting for the climax...which was never delivered.Haunted house...dead child haunting the new inhabitants...wanting revenge... cliché. I mean, even the Ring had that whole water theme going on. Don't waste your time, just rent/buy the Ring again instead of wasting your cash on this movie.</fullReview>

I went to a local theater where I would normally spend sixteen bucks for two of us to see a movie, little did I know there is student discount and it was only twelve bucks, PLEASE...can I have my money back! The only thing that kept me awake in this film, was the cold chill down my back from the blasting air conditioner and the fact that I had to take a leak every five minutes from the jumbo pop I sucked down to keep me busy. The only thing less appealing than wasting another two hours watching this film would be to sit and watch paint dry. I admit I have seen many poor films, but this was just plain robbery. If your interested in seeing a movie with two scenes and a poor plot, Dark Water may just be your flick. Dark Water is not the least bit creepy, the slightest bit scary, and at no times interesting. I only pity those of you who waste your efforts in attempting to keep your eyes open for this tragedy of a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark Water Has Creepy Moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Koji Suzuki has enjoyed recent popularity through his minimalist horror stories told with more atmosphere, psychological brooding and menace than big budget effects. His first big hit, The Ring, has been serialized in multiple sequels in Japan and redone successfully in the U.S. In Dark Water, he has fabricated another tale involving restless souls and unexplained events that go bump in the night. The result, while reasonably spooky, is an adequate mood piece with a few effective scares and revelations.Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) is in an emotionally draining custody battle with ex husband Kyle (Dougray Scott) over their young daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade). Forced to find affordable housing, mother and daughter move into a low rent apartment presided over by the desk clerk/custodian, Veeck (Pete Postlethwaite) and an unreliable building manager, Mr. Murray (John C. Reilly). Upon moving in their drab, dreary unit, strange things begin to happen. Elevator doors close and open mysteriously on the wrong floors and black water seeps in from the floor above in increasingly grotesque amounts. Ceci attends school and begins to talk to an imaginary friend with alarming frequency. And whose backpack was left on the roof of the building? Add to this Dahlia's constant battles with her ex-husband and her own dysfunctional childhood with a hateful mother and a father who abandoned the family. She becomes paranoid and frightened especially when she visits the tenant's who lived above in room 10F. It seems the family that lived there had a father who abandoned them, and the mother was unable to take care of her daughter, Natasha, who is the same age as Ceci. As Dahlia fights her own sanity to discover the truth, the past will haunt her in a terrifying climax.As an atmospheric, eerie, ghost story, Dark Water does succeed. The steady, methodical pacing works in the story's favor. Think of horror master Val Lewton, whose Gothic B-movies of the 1940's are memorable e.g. the original Cat People. But for those looking for a shocking, intense payoff, there will be mild disappointment. Recent horror entries, The Ring and The Others have fared better in delivering the goods. There just isn't a powerful, knockout scene or sufficiently startling surprises. The parallels between Dahlia's life and the mysterious family above her apartment are not fully exploited or defined as they should be. The film tries to develop the psychologically tortuous journey of Dahlia as the happenings in room 10F are brewing, and somehow the two plot lines don't quite mesh into an intelligent, coherent storyline. This is perhaps more a fault of the script adaptation by Rafael Yglesias and the source material from its Japanese authors including Suzuki, Takashige Ichise and Hideo Nakata. Director Walter Salles, fresh from a solid turn with The Motorcycle Diaries, does a decent job but takes the film's story as far as his script will allow him. At times the film feels like a Hitchcock piece with its female protagonist going against difficult circumstances with little or no support from others. The visuals especially the water effects are unnerving at times and photographed starkly by Affonso Beato, and the somber score by Angelo Badalamenti reminds one of his previous collaborations (Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks) with David Lynch.Jennifer Connelly is fairly convincing as the mother who struggles with her own demons while protecting her daughter from unknown forces. Visually, her ethereal beauty is ideally suited for the subject matter. Gade is quite good as Ceci, and we are mesmerized by her actions and reactions from beginning to end. She and Connelly work well together and do a good job of setting up their close relationship which drives the storyline. John C. Reilly is amusing as an irresponsible building manager. His early scenes trying to rent the apartment to Connelly's character are downright funny. Tim Roth as her sympathetic lawyer is almost unrecognizable in a role reminiscent of Charles Durning's in Sisters. While it is good support, it ultimately goes nowhere. Postlethwaite scores as a bizarre character whose background is insufficiently explored.What hurts this film is also the knowledge of previous haunted films like The Other, Don't Look Now, The Changeling, and Audrey Rose, all from the 1970's. Some moviegoers, particularly fans of The Ring will have an easy time figuring out the hidden meanings in the plot line. When you think about it, Dark Water is a deceptively simple tale told with a minimum of characters in a confined setting. Like a mildly scary ghost story read at night, it comes and goes but does not stay very long.</fullReview>

You have to ask yourself where was she ? How they left her alone ? Did they let her with Flanders ? And if yes, does that happen frequently ?", "What are the lyrics of A Day In The Life of a Fool ?!", "Grrrr, you said that before !", "Oh God, even my inner monologue becomes boring !", "Clearly this movie's bore is CONTAGIOUS !!"Well, that was me while watching Dark Water. Sorry. Dark DAMN Water ! So this is a Horror ?! Last time I checked, Horror movies are supposed to be thrilling and scary. But this one isn't this or that. It's not even tame Horror. It is not a Horror in the first place !All the deal is about the horror of unseen, very kind, child, a school bag that doesn't go away, and needing desperately a plumber ! I don't know why many potential ideas weren't utilized. I mean the janitor character could have looked creepy, instead of mixed up, weak-kneed, and ? sometimes ? faint-hearted ! The movie could have had good jolts, not all obvious, anticlimactic, and frankly bad ones !! There was no creativity whatsoever in terms of old, new, or rather found shocking moments. Unless they thought that seeing a splotch in the ceiling is enough horror !! Hence, you can say that the script didn't make any decent effort. But what could you say if knew that the directing didn't make any decent effort either ?!!!!!!The director must have been working under massive dose of sleeping bells. I won't say that he was as dead as the ghost child in the movie. Actually No. That child was so lively compared to him !It's enraging when the directing doesn't make anything effective (or doesn't make anything !). How many moments that weren't treated fairly in this movie ? Nearly the whole thing ! "In a horror movie, you're supposed to frighten." It's in the "Genre Movies for Dummies". So how come that director didn't read it ?! True that being un-scary in a scary movie; is a problem. But when the pace slips away too, it's a disaster ! Review my inner monologue again to get the full picture ! Furthermore (yes, there is more !), I couldn't understand why the movie was deliberately perplexing at some points. For instance, if the intro's little girl from the year 1974 is our heroine as a child, so how come she's in the picture of the upstairs' family ?! Hmmm, maybe that's because the heroine sees herself in that very child. But how she felt the bond with her that early, without hearing her story ?! Plus, seeing that from the heroine's point of view, from start to finish, sure misled the viewers to think that those neighbors are related to her someway. I guess the movie-makers thought "Ok, mislead them. Maybe that would compensate for the lost horror !!". Another matter, when the heroine is in the haunted building's elevator for the first time, she feels something weird under her hand, and the janitor wonders, as if he saw Jesus Christ, "OH MY GOD!!". The thing is the movie doesn't explain what did she feel ? And the same can be said about the janitor's astonishment, knowing that he ? till the end ? had no idea what the heck was going on ?! So, what was that "OH MY GOD!!" for, especially while all what he saw was just a woman standing alone in an elevator ???!!!! The possible pros : (Jennifer Connelly)'s presence and performance. She was exhausting, deeply agonized, confused, and struggling to smile all along. Her truthfulness earned the movie something solid. (Ariel Gade), as the daughter, was into the point as innocent and vague. Despite their swift appearances, and the fact of them as catchy names on the poster only, (John C. Reilly) and (Tim Roth) did fine. Yet, the best of the movie was in its last 10 minutes, when all the factors made their long-awaited "descent effort". It was when this movie remembered its old goal, and finally turned into a Horror !The real lost in this movie wasn't that child. It was the craftsmanship of making that child's story work as something any thrilling or scary. Therefore, the sole horror in Dark Water was its bore. And oh boy, was it greatly done ?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In many ways Dark Water improves upon the memorable Japanese film it's based on. The earlier version was directed by Hideo Nakata (whose excellent shocker Ringu was remade in America as The Ring), but in the hands of director Walter Salles (The Motorcycle Diaries) and screenwriter Rafael Yglesias, this psychological horror story gets an intelligent and more chillingly effective overhaul. The story is rooted in themes of love and loss that Yglesias similarly explored in his excellent screenplay for Peter Weir's Fearless, here focusing on young mother Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) as she endures difficult divorce proceedings and settles into a low-rent apartment in New York's cramped Roosevelt Island community, near Manhattan, with her young daughter Cecilia (Ariel Gade). Amidst seemingly endless rainfall, Dahlia's world slowly unravels, and Connelly is superb as a woman seemingly on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Or is she? Could it be that Cecilia's imaginary friend, and the apartment's persistent leaks of dark, dripping water, are the ghostly manifestations of a young girl who had been abandoned by the previous tenant? Creepy atmosphere and high anxiety are expertly maintained by Salles, and supporting roles for Tim Roth, John C. Reilly and especially Pete Postlethwaite give the film an added edge of mystery. The tension builds slowly (gore-mongers and action fans may be disappointed), but the cumulative effect is palpably unnerving, inviting favorable comparison to Rosemary's Baby. Unlike some other remakes of Japanese horror hits, Dark Water doesn't feel redundant; it stands on its own thanks to the impressive work of everyone involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dark water is back...and it's still not very interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My TV guide said that this film "simply doesn't have the suspense of the original". I was hoping that would be true, but unfortunately this film largely has the same amount of suspense as the original; and that is not much. However, I would say that this film bucks a remake trend somewhat, as it is a more involving take on the story originally written by Kôji Suzuki than the one seen in the 2002 Japanese film; although that possibly does have a lot to do with the fact that this one stars incredible natural beauty Jennifer Connelly, who kept me watching even during the more boring moments of the film (which are numerous). The plot focuses on Dahlia Williams; a woman involved in a custody battle with her husband over their daughter Cecilia. She moves into an old apartment block with her daughter and soon the pair is 'menaced' by a big damp patch on the ceiling and a red kid's rucksack. Things get worse when the kid develops an imaginary friend who she insists is real. It later becomes apparent that the apartment block is haunted.Like the original, this film is very, very slow and other than the lead actress; there's not much to enjoy for most of the duration. It seriously takes over an hour for it to get going and only the last ten minutes or so really contain anything of interest, and even then it isn't that interesting. The film mostly consists of build up and while it's well acted and nice looking build up, it's not very interesting and fails to create the important elements (intrigue and menace), thus rendering it mostly pointless. Jennifer Connelly was the star of classic eighties horror masterpiece Phenomena in 1985 and it unfortunately took her twenty years to make her way back into the premier film genre...although arguably this film is not really horror either since most of the "action" focuses on drama, not terror and suspense. Still, seeing Connelly on screen is good even if it is in a lacklustre film. The film does benefit from a good supporting cast, with John C. Reilly, an unrecognisable Tim Roth and the always solid Pete Postlethwaite in support. It all boils down to an ending that wraps up the story well, but is also a bit of a letdown as with so much build up, a bigger payoff was needed; plus it's really predictable. I honestly don't understand why anyone liked the original Dark Water, and while this film is not much better; it is a superior remake. Still, there are not many good reasons to see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Dark Water" is really dark, for a reason.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm 47, married 26 years, four kids. I was raised watching Television and Movies. All I can say after watching "Dark Water" is BARF! God, what an awful movie. For those high brow esoteric self appointed movie experts, how dare you give this movie anything but a one. The only reason I gave it a one was because I couldn't give it a minus one (or more). The plot plods, the characters are predictable, the "drama" is simplistic, the climax was nonexistent and the acting is marginal. The one thing you are right about is that it is NOT a horror film. It's not even a drama. It fits right in that crack of movie genres known as sad and painful...to watch; not intelligent, and barely even human.Jennifer Conally never has a real, believable happy moment...how is that. NO human has ever existed like that! The supporting cast was okay and did as well as they could with such an idiotically conceived picture.If that late great program was still on the air, "Mystery Science Theater 3000" would have to include a critique of this one along with "Manos: Hand of Fate" and "Monster A-Go-Go." This movie's low ratings have nothing to do with the fact that not enough people have seen it. The movie just absolutely and unequivocally sucks! What a waste of money (for the studio to produce it and anybody to pay to see it). I'm only happy I saw it on Satellite so the cost to sit through it was negligible.I know why the "Water" was "Dark." It was full of crap!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dark Water is set in New York where Dahlia Williams (Jennifer Connelly) is undergoing a bitter divorce from her husband Kyle (Dougray Scott) with custody of their young six year old daughter Cecilia (Ariel Grade) becoming very nasty. Dahlia &amp; Cecilia move into an apartment on Roosevelt island, it's a bit of a dump but it's all she can afford &amp; Cecilia seems to like it so why not? Mother &amp; daughter move in &amp; notice a damp spot on the ceiling which gets increasingly worse, strange things begin to happen &amp; Dahlia starts to question her own sanity. Soon it seems that the odd events might be down to supernatural causes...Directed by Walter Salles this was a Hollywood remake of a Japanese horror film also called Dark Water (2002), this Hollywood remake actually stays pretty faithful to the original &amp; I had to say that I was rather unimpressed with it. The script by Rafael Yglesias is just so dull &amp; lethargic, the first three quarters of Dark Water feels like some melodrama with the arguing Dahlia &amp; Klye trying to get points over one another in the custody battle of Cecilia with really dour issues surrounding Dahlia moving into a dump of an apartment just to add to the tedium. I'm sorry but a damp patch on the ceiling, the fact it's dark all the time &amp; the lift is a bit temperamental are hardly the stuff of nightmares, is it? The fact a tap turns itself on is hardly going to tear anyone's nerves to shreds is it? I suppose a damp patch on your own ceiling might cause some nightmares but not for the same reasons the makers of Dark Water would like! At over 100 minutes Dark Water feels like it goes on forever, while I understand the main aim of the script was more psychological than visceral &amp; that the makers were trying to get into Dahlia's mind &amp; not make it totally clear what was going on but I just wish they had done it in a slightly less boring &amp; slightly more interesting way. The ending is also disappointing, besides being less than thrilling the twist is underwhelming &amp; isn't put across in a very concise way. Overall I just thought it was a depressing bore from start to finish with sub soap opera melodramatics rather than ghostly goings on.Director Welles turns in a stylish film but why is it so dark all the time? Fair enough it's about water &amp; the constant overcast rainy weather is supposed to reinforce that but it just gets so dull &amp; depressing to watch. There's absolutely no colour in Dark Water at all, I am sure this is deliberate but it's not a choice that I think looks particularly good or appealing. There's a few decent scenes &amp; it has a certain gloomy atmosphere but it still feels more like a soap opera than a horror film. Welles also likes his dizzying overhead shots too, there's loads of them.With a supposed budget of about $30,000,00 Dark Water was a well funded film, to be honest I can't really see where all the money went. Sure it's well made but there aren't any big stars in it, the special effects are low key &amp; it's set mainly in the same location. Filmed in New York, Los Angeles &amp; Ontario in Canada. The cast do a decent job &amp; the performances are fine.Dark Water is more of a dreary rain soaked melodrama than a ghostly fright fest &amp; that for me kills it. The 'Unrated' version is actually shorter than the theatrical one &amp; despite adding an alternative dream sequence removes certain scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am SO tired of these BORING 'horror' movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am so sick and tired of lame, boring, non-frightening, lack-of-imagination "horror" films like this one with plot holes so big you could roll Camryn Manheim through them! Why do studios insist on releasing these PG-13 films that are never scary? If you are going to make a horror film, make it an "R" with plenty of violence and nudity. Otherise don't waste our time. I had a LONG list of things that made no sense in this stupid movie, but I'm not going to bother posting them. Skip this thing if you can. If you REALLY want to be scared go listen to the new David Lee Roth radio show. That train wreck is so freaking bad it's horrifying!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't see this movie. It's truly horrible. There is no ending. It is all fantasy and made up. I can see the producers and directors sitting in a room saying "let the audience decide what they think." Well buddies I think your movie sucks.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Jennifer Connelly may be a good actress but she can't save this movie. Also while the other actors are also good they serve absolutely no purpose in moving hte plot forward. The only pleasant thing is the little girl. She is beautiful and acts well for her age. it will be interesting to see what happens to her later in life. Do we have a Dakota Fanning on our hands?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We should have seen War of the Worlds...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if this comment will be helpful, but it's just my story of what happened when I saw it. My mother, my sister, and I went to the theatre to see Fantastic Four... But they were sold out for all the showings until midnight and it was 10:00 PM, so we weren't going to wait that long. We decided to see a different movie instead, either War of the Worlds or Dark Water. So, guess what we saw? My sister and mother thought it would be good considering the previews and the hype, etc... When we got in, it was completely packed! The movie may have been only an hour and a half, but it seemed to drag on forever; you're just thinking "Oh my god, when will this end?!" Nothing remotely interesting happened at all throughout the film and the plot line was just total crap. When the movie ended, we found out that we were not alone in our opinions. It was the first time I ever saw an entire theatre full of people going "WTF?!" One guy even said "This s**t is bananas!" It was so terrible that we couldn't help but laugh at it on the car ride home. Unless you want to make fun of this movie, I advise you never to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rancid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fortunate enough to have a friend think of me last night when he obtained sneak preview tickets for the afore mentioned film. I imagined the fact that it had Jennifer Connely cast in the starring role would mean we had something to look forward to. She's joined by a strong cast of other secondaries and co-stars but in the end all the strong acting in the world can't save the drowning direction and plot.There is a wonderful emphasis on the struggles that occur between married couple adjusting to the separation and all the nuances of settling the important matters that ride shotgun to it. Unfortunately this movie is proclaimed to be a thriller/suspense/horror... fill in the genre. Imagine my dismay when the emphasis is anywhere but on that. When the first at least 45 minutes do much more to examine the struggles of a divorcing couple and the custody of their shared child your faith in the plot moves from around the corner to the other side of the city which requires you taking the tram to find it.The acting was all pretty top notch. There are moments you question what is actually occurring. With out giving away anything crucial the director does a horrible job of giving the audience context for which things are occurring and instead either leaves it unresolved (kind of like sub-arcs of the shield lol) or tries to explain it later which screams to me of deleted scenes and many of them. For a non-spoiling example pay attention to the father's head nod as he drops of Cissy in the morning at the mother's apt.It was fairly obvious in the first few minutes what was going on and the end point we would finally arrive at. Not it one place was their justifiable reason to take the movie so slow. The initial attempts to make the audience jump are done so poorly that the audience instead seemed to laugh at all of them, and this was more than half way through the movie. The movie takes some rancid steps at the end causing false realities (fades to black) and is inevitably candy coated at the finale making me truly sick as... hey wasn't this supposed to be suspense.Dark Water was a drain. I'm happy I didn't pay for it, and I hope you don't either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing exciting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got home from the July 5th sneak preview of this movie in Plantation, Florida.Know what struck me about this movie,....... Nothing! Everything about it was average, and it was completely without any real standout moments or scenes. This movie seems to borrow from The Sixth Sense, The Others, and The Ring equally and create a homogenized Velveeta Cheese Kind of movie, It's tolerable, and goes good on nachos, but not very original or authentic. If you are expecting the creepiness of the Ring you'll be left wanting. I place this on a par with the Nichole Kidman movie "The Others". I have learned that The director stole parts of this movie to make "The Ring" maybe that's why this movie seems so lackluster. Other people in the theatre made comments along the lines of "Boring", "slow", "waste of time" and "not scary at all".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to begin? Dark Water looks like a fun, scary, summer movie from every trailer that is shown, and I admit that I looked forward to seeing it. But now that I have sat down and taken the hours out of my life to watch the film, I feel like I have wasted a part of my life for this movie. To be frank, Dark Water is a boring, and un-scary film. I thought of this movie as being along the lines (in scares and suspense) of the remake of "The Ring", but I found myself disappointed in what I watched take place on screen. I'm not sure if it's just me, but dirty water gushing out of a faucet every 5 min. is not what I call "scary". Obviously I did not like this movie, and nearly the entire theater who saw the film with me felt the same way. Many people immediately got on their cell phones and called others saying how bad it was, and one woman said to her (husband I'm presuming) that she felt that she had been ripped off, even though it was a free screening. From what is shown in the trailers (panic, glass breaking, and water gushing out in every direction), all of that happens within the final 15 or 10 min. of the movie. What is worse is that the first hour or so is so dull and boring that you loose interest almost completely by the time the, do I dare say, "fun", events occur. In the beginning, Dark Water seems to be a slow paced, and sad drama. Not at all a scary/suspenseful thriller. The ending is bizarre, and pointless. The mystery of what happens is unclearly solved and we are left thinking "what just happened?". The director takes his time setting up the movie (drawing out divorce, custody hearings, looking through the apartment for a good 20 min., walking around the halls, riding in the elevator, going to school, among many other things), and then when you finally care about what is happening, it is like he slams the book shut and leaves you disappointed. At one time I looked forward to seeing Dark Water beat the Fantastic 4 at the box office, because the Fantastic 4 looked even worse from previews, interviews and trailers, but now... now after seeing Dark Water in its entirety, I have to say to everyone wondering how Dark Water really is: Save your money. You will most likely be very disappointed in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is just awful. It is pointless and personally i don't see any reason for making this film. It is described as a chilling horror flick but it is nothing more than a cheap piece of rubbish.This film has no saving grace it is pointless, dull and without a single shock or moment of suspense. I was extremely disappointed in this film and found myself drifting off through most of it. Very dull, pointless and a waste of time. Don't waste yours by watching it.Why this film was made i don't know but if there is anyone on the face of the earth who enjoyed it, i would be very surprised. I repeat DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS FILM IT Isn't WORTH IT!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An over-stretched short story...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I have a personal hate for this movie because it's exactly the short story I had written years ago. I mean, if these guys knew Turkish I'd say they stole it from me. Secondly, as you can clearly see, it is BAD because IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SHORT STORY, not a long movie. When u try to stretch a short story subject into a real length movie, this is the result you get. The extra stories of divorced parents and stuff has nothing to do with the main plot and obviously written to increase the length. I see some comments insulting people who don't like this movie. I respect them, for if they see the movie for anything but a thriller, they might like it. It practically is nothing more than another movie with "little scary girl" element if u see it as a thriller. It has NOTHING new to give you. NOTHING God damn it! On the other hand, if u have a taste for "Grudge", you might still like this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why you may think is bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing is that this movie is just an American version of a Japanese one. This is the whole explanation of why you think it sucks. The difference of culture and state of mind between the two nations is obvious and what they think is really scary and has a deep message to them just may seem to you as boring and crappy... I actually didn't see this American version, but I saw the older Japanese one is 2002. I liked that one, and I think it was OK. A bit boring at times, but the ending was building up and finished well. You can go watch at first the original movie and then if you like any bits of it, you can try this one, I would suggest..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, much better than the original !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, what a great movie. As i expected, some people obviously just want to make it sound bad for the sake of it. I mean, this is a remake, so it has to be bad, right ? What a stupid thing to do. This film is way better than the original, there's no question what so ever about that. The story stays the same, more or less. The atmosphere is so much better than that of the original. The acting is amazing. The camera-work and the screenplay are much better and the effects as well as the score are superb.Now this is logical, as the actors and everybody else involved had a better education and the budget was much higher.But to rip it off, just because a film was remade ???I mean, it's easy, if you are interested, check on the comments for the original, you'll find it gets away much better.If you then decide, that it sounds interesting and that you might want to see that film, but only in much better quality, just go for the remake.</fullReview>

The movie is tense, scary and yet believable.A movie truly underrated by the fury of the geeks that simply cannot accept a remake that is CLEARLY best than the original! Don't believe in what they say! The original is a totally amateur film, poorly directed and with a shameous production.Just remembering, the original is full of junk actings and is a "direct to video" movie.I don't have nothing against the j-horrors, i loved Ju-ON and Chakushin Ari, but this remake is far batter than the Japanese, believe me!If you are a j-horror fan, don't be childish and give a chance to this remake!For me, the best horror movie since Signs!JUST RUN FOR THE THEATER!</fullReview>
