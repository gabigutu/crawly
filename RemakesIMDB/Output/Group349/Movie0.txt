		<shortDescription>Last Chances and Lost Dreams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a few great writers of the overheated repressed and desperate from the theater and film world of the 1950's. At the top sit the two greatest, Tennessee Williams and William Inge. In a decade of conformity and great prosperity Inge and Williams tackled subjects ahead of their time. Of course they in some cases had to veil the subject matter but that lead to some wonderful revelations in writing and reading between the lines.  In this DVD from Colombia of Inge's Pulitzer Prize winning ?Picnic' we have one of the best films of this genre of sexual repression, animal heat, and desperation in small town America. Most reviewers of this film might begin with the leads but I must start of with the wonderful Verna Felton as Helen Potts the sweet old lady who is caretaker of her aged mother and lives next door to the Owens family. This gifted and now forgotten character actress sets the tone of the picture as she welcomes drifter Hal Carter (William Holden) into her house for some breakfast. At the end of the film she glows in tender counterpoint to the dramatic ending. She is the only person who understands Hal, even more than Madge (Kim Novak). Her speech about having a man in the house is pure joy to watch. Her most touching scene is at the picnic when she tells Betty Field. `You don't know what it's meant to me having you and the girls next door.' It is a small but important performance that frames the entire story with warmth and understanding. Betty Field turns in a sterling performance as Flo Owens, Mother of Madge and Millie. She is disapproving of Millie's rebellious teen and smothering of her Kansas hothouse rose Madge. This deeply felt performance is a stark contrast to her lusty waitress in Inges `Bus Stop' the next year. A single Mom trying in desperation to keep Madge from making the same mistakes she did. She becomes so wrapped up in Madge's potential for marriage to the richest boy in town she completely ignores the budding greatness that is bursting to get out in her real treasure. Millie. Susan Strasberg creates in her Millie a sweet comic oddball. She is the youngest daughter who awkwardly moves through the landscape of Nickerson Kansas nearly un-noticed, reading the scandalous `Ballad of the Sad Café' - being the only one who is different and can't hide it. Her yearning to get out of the smallness of small town life is colored with the skill of a young actress with greatness her. Watch how she handles her most tender scenes with Kim Novak. Strasberg has a deep connection with Millie, an understanding of what it means to want to get out and yet want so desperately to fit in. Rosalind Russell nearly steals the show as the fourth woman in the Owens household boarder, Rosemary the schoolteacher. She is the living example of what Flo doesn't want Millie to become, a frantic, hopeless and clutching spinster. In the capable hands of Miss Russell we have a real powerhouse of a performance. She imbues Rosemary with all the uptight disapproval of a woman who knows that her time has past and there are very few options left. She is electric in her need for love. Every nuance of her emotions is sublime in her presentation. Just watch her hands alone. She is present down to her fingertips as this poor clinging woman. Floating above all of this is Madge Owens, the kind of girl who is too pretty to be real. The kind of girl who in a small town like this is not understood to have any real feelings or thoughts other than those that revolve around being beautiful and empty. Enter Kim Novak, who is just such a girl. Who could ever expect such a beauty to be anything more than just pretty? But Miss Novak, a vastly underrated actress in her day (as were most beauties of the day) paints a knowing and glowing portrait of Madge. Her explosion of sexual heat upon meeting Hal for the first time is internal and barely perceptible until she looks at him from behind the safety of the screen door the end of their first scene. It's as if that screen door is a firewall protecting her from the flames. This device is used again near the end of the film where the screen becomes something that keeps her and Hal separated from each other in a new way. At that point it is a safety net keeping them from sex by calling her home. Here she hesitates again to reveal her longing for him. She fights in the early part of the film to keep her sexual desire for Hal in check. That night she loses her fight at the picnic and we watch as she opens to reveal a woman of feelings and dreams so much deeper than the prettiness of her eyes or the luminosity of her skin. This is one of Kim Novak's early great roles and one she fills out with lush and deep emotion. The lives of all of these women of Nickerson Kansas are changed one Labor Day in 1955 when Hal Carter comes steaming into town. William Holden gives a raw and wounded portrayal to Hal, a man at the edge of his youth and on the verge of becoming a lost man. He lives as he always has, on the cache of his golden boy charm and his muscular magnetism. Holden was 35 when he made Picnic, a golden boy at the edge of his youth. He was perfect for the part. Some reviewers say he was too old to play Hal, but I disagree. Without being thirty-five in real life as well as in the story Rosemary's `Crummy Apollo' speech would not be so effective or devastating. Hal is a man 10 to 12 years out of college who never bothered to grow up, a man who never let anyone get too close for fear they might see through is bravado and discover his fears of feeling something, anything before it's too late.  Holden also brings a sexual heat to the film that is eons beyond the time it was filmed. He is presented almost like a slab of meat, something we were used to seeing in our female stars of the day, but not so blatantly in our men. He struts around in a pre-Stonewall dream of sexy hotness. Not only the girls in town notice him but a few boys too. (There are several layers to Nick Adams paperboy if one bothers to look.) When finally Holden sparks with Novak they blow the lid off of the uptight code bound studio-strangled world of Hollywood in the Fifties. The film is photographed magnificently in lush color and cinemascope by famed cinematographer James Wong Howe. The famous score by George Durning is classic not only for the famous reworking of the old standard `Moonglow' but for his virtuosity in dramatic power. This is a giant of a score from the silver age of film music. The direction by Josh Logan is perfect in every way and stands among the best of his work. The DVD has a few extras, more than most Colombia releases. However I want to point out that there is an excellent photomontage with music from the film to be found here. In watching the shots and listening to the accompanying score by Durning one can really appreciate his artistry as a composer. Finally, this is a very sexy film and should not be missed as a lesion in how really smart people got so much past the censors in an age of sexual repression and conformity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>soul-searching at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It pains me to see people miss Picnic's message; as people hastily label it as 'outdated' or flawed in any way, they neglect the fact that what Inge, Logan, and the cast have offered us is indeed universal. Set on Labor Day weekend in Middle America, this is a film about the bittersweet irony of living in a world governed by rules and time. The characters in Picnic is confronted by a demon that, if not dealt with appropriately, serves to consume them and ensure that they become the thing they most fear. In a desperate search to find love, Rosemary (Rosalind Russell) alienates people to the extent that she seems increasingly destined to be alone. Admired throughout the town for her beauty, Madge (Kim Novak), in her unwillingness or inability to assert herself, is trapped inside her pretty face and finds she cannot build a character to support it. Her younger sister Millie (Susan Strasberg) is devoted to intellectual pursuit but finds her intellectual superiority complex serves to limit her peer group and rob her of her childhood. She is seen throughout the film sneaking cigarettes, and at one point steals a swig of whiskey, all in a rather revealing display of her conflict with regards to her place in the transition from youth to adulthood. Mrs Owens (Betty Field), having been left by her husband presumably for a younger woman, attempts to force Madge into an early marriage to a rich man so that she will not face the same anguish, but her dominating insistence on Madge's beauty as her chief asset is what eventually drives her away with little regret. This truly is the story of the varying ways people create and deal with solitude. Each character undergoes the struggle we all must to find a person beneath the masks we hide behind. It is a study of the irony of the evanescence of happiness - at this Labor Day picnic that is the great joyful gathering of the entire town, each of our main characters seeks their own escape. The emotional rawness of the end of Summer is exposed and serves as the perfect time for seasonal as well as personal transition. They are all, in effect, living parts of a sunset, as described by Russell in perhaps the most significant examination of time in the film. Holden's character is unique in that it is a true testament to the everyman and the power of chance. His arrival in this town is in fact the catalyst for reflection and action, and he shakes things up without having any inherent wisdom or inspiration (he is actually something of a moron, thus his ability to make things happen is so much more intriguing). That this is a passionate and beautifully acted (the occasional vacancy and slowness only a reinforcement of the emotional stagnancy Logan intends to have us defeat) love story with a heart-wrenchingly beautiful theme song is only icing on the cake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moonglow and Rosalind Russell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Inge had his finger on the pulse of small town America. He wasn't checking the heartbeats of its inhabitants but his own. I've just said that as if I knew all about it and I don't, but I sense it. I mean, "Splendor In The Grass", "The Dark At The Top Of The Stairs", "Come Back Little Sheeba" That's all the evidence we need to know that he was a male writer with a woman's heart. "Picnic" epitomises that theory. Director Joshua Logan and writer Daniel Taradash trusted Inge's world without questioning it. Everything flows with the irrational sanity of a woman's heart. William Holden was a bit too old for the part but who cares! He is William Holden, capable to provoke passions of Mediterranean intensity at any age. He seems a bit self conscious at times and that helps the character's foibles no end. Kim Novak is breathtaking. Susan Strasberg milks her tomboy with a longing for all its worth. Betty Field, Daisy Buchanan in the original "Great Gatsby", gives a masterful performance without uttering a word that may reveal what she's actually feeling, until the end of course. That scene in which she tries to stop her daughter from going away, is as much Field's as it is Inge's. Rosalind Russell didn't get the Oscar for her superb, time bomb disguised in a school teacher's dress, performance. Her craving for sex and romance and sex and marriage and sex is as bold as anything she had ever done and Rosalind Russell new how to be bold from "His Girl Friday" to "Auntie Mame". The Moonglow sequence has become a classic moment in pictures. Deservedly so. I would suggest, if you haven't done it yet, take a trip through William Inge's territory. Familiar faces, familiar landscapes, familiar feelings, all completely new.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but Haunting and Powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Picnic offers superior acting all around, some great cinematography, and a number of excellent scenes, including the famous dance sequence between Holden and Novak. The writing, unfortunately, veers between wonderful and maudlin, and the movie feels outdated in many ways. Worst of all, the directing and music can be heavy-handed at times, clubbing the viewer with melodrama in some of the key moments, when a more subtle approach would have turned this into a real classic.Yet, despite its flaws, there's something special about this film. It has a haunting quality that I can't quite put my finger on. A kind of nostalgia - not for the supposed innocence of small-town life, which the film shows to be a myth, but for the disappearing natural wildness of ourselves as people, the primitive element in humanity that both causes problems and gives us real vitality.My wife and I found ourselves discussing Picnic at length over dinner the following night and even watched several of the scenes again. There are many good details and powerful moments scattered among the weaker parts. I appreciated William Holden's performance even more the second time around - his sense of impatience and desperation are palpable. And he's such a great presence on the screen - I wound up watching him more than Novak in the dance sequence. In fact, my one disappointment with this scene is that Novak doesn't serve as his cinematic equal. She's no Bacall who can fill the screen with Bogart. Rosalind Russell and Arthur O'Connell both do great jobs, especially during the scene where they are discussing marriage. Susan Strasberg pulls off a difficult role and manages to look even more attractive than Kim Novak at times, reminding me of a young Winona Ryder.The Holden and Novak characters are both viewed as sexual objects, yet they're actually quite humble people who can't handle the shallowness of the society around them and who are searching for genuine love. William Holden is always a pleasure to watch, and his fans should find this role particularly interesting. Picnic won't go down as a great film, but there is a great film lurking somewhere inside it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fans of fifties' movies are still enamored of Kim Novak?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kim Novak made a tremendous impression as the heroine of "Picnic". Looking cool, lush and marvelous in lilac as she walked through her films expressing polite interest and a terror of emotional reactions toward the situations which arose? "Picnic" follows a brawny wanderer who causes sexual havoc one summer in a small American town? Holden was the charming drifter who arrives, on one hot Labor Day, to a small Kansas town, to look up an old schoolmate, Alan (Robertson), who is the town rich-man's son and from whom he hopes to obtain work?Alan is kind at first?until Madge, Alan's fiancée falls for Hal?"Picnic" was quite compulsive despite some overacting? Betty Field was excellent as Madge's warm and protective mother who fears for her daughter's happiness if she passes up her rich fiancée? Madge's teenaged sister (Strasberg) longed for beauty and sympathy? Her good-hearted neighbor, Verna Felton, was gently compassionate?Robertson was handsome but presumptuous and arrogant? O'Connell was delightful as the confused and unsure cigar-chomping salesman? Rosalind Russell was the easily frustrated and inconsistent spinster who loses her self-control while drunk and practically accosts Hal on the dance floor, destroying his shirt? When Hal rebuffs her, she storms off in anger; later she begs her shy boyfriend to marry her? Beautifully photographed, "Picnic" will remain always a loved romantic film, largely for the high chemistry of its two stars, Holden and Novak?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Sense of Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Picnic was the second film that acclaimed stage director Joshua Logan did, adapting work that he had previously directed for Broadway. I absolutely marvel at Logan's sense of the cinema for someone who worked primarily in the theater. Had he concentrated on the screen instead, I'm sure Logan would have been as acclaimed as John Ford or Alfred Hitchcock or even Orson Welles.William Inge's play Picnic is set in a small Kansas town where drifter William Holden comes to town to look up and old friend from college, Cliff Robertson. As it happens he arrives on Labor Day and the town is having their annual Labor Day picnic. In that 24 hours he changes the lives of all around him, mostly for the better. Especially the women folk.Holden does a very good job in a role he was really miscast in. The part should have gone to Marlon Brando or James Dean or even Paul Newman. Newmwn was in the original Broadway cast, but in the Cliff Robertson part. The lead was done by Ralph Meeker.The women of all ages go for Holden unbridled sexuality from Verna Felton, Betty Field, Rosalind Russell, Kim Novak, and Susan Strassberg in descending order of age. They all kind of like him, but Holden goes for Novak who's Robertson's girl. I think you can figure the rest of it out.Arthur O'Connell as confirmed bachelor/boyfriend of Russell got an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, but lost to Jack Lemmon in Mister Roberts which incidentally was directed by Joshua Logan on Broadway and uncredited for the screen when John Ford left the film. But the performance that was absolutely the best was that of Rosalind Russell as the schoolteacher who's approaching what would be called spinster hood and not liking it a bit. She's sending out a booty call to Holden that is unmistakable.In her memoirs Russell said that when Logan asked her to take Eileen Heckart's part from Broadway, he didn't even get to finish the sentence when she agreed. Picnic was playing on Broadway the same time she was doing Wonderful Town and she admired the play by Inge and the work of Joshua Logan very much.I like the individual performances in Picnic, but even more I like the way Logan used the whole town of Hutchinson, Kansas where the film was shot on location as a stage setting. One of the best transferals from stage to cinema ever and it sure helped to have someone at the helm who knew the property and knew how to accomplish his goal. Picnic is a great view of America in the red states in the Eisenhower years and should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A drifter is the catalyst for a lot of small town shake-ups</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hunky drifter Hal (William Holden) arrives in a small Kansas town, disturbing the status quo in "Picnic," a 1955 film based on Wiliam Inge's play and directed by Josh Logan. It co-stars Kim Novak, Susan Strasberg, Rosalind Russell, Betty Field, Cliff Robertson, Arthur O'Connell, and Verna Felton.It's Labor Day and time for the big annual picnic. Beautiful, 19-year-old Madge Owens prepares to attend the picnic with Arthur (Robertson), a young man from a wealthy family. She fights with her jealous, nerdy sister, Millie. And she's warned by her mother (Field) that with each passing year she will become less marketable as a wife. She's advised to solidify things with Arthur. Renting a room from them is Rosemary, a schoolteacher - what one called "an old maid" back then. A brittle loudmouth, she's doesn't have not much use for her boyfriend Howard, but he's taking her to the picnic.When Hal jumps off the train to look up his old college friend Arthur, he innocently becomes a catalyst for change. In one way or another, he manages to arouse emotions - mostly sexual - in nearly everyone he meets. A braggart who gives his loose-ends, wandering life a romantic spin, he's hoping Arthur's dad will give him a job. Then he sees Madge."Picnic" is a beautiful story about loneliness, settling for what you can get, love, frustration, and dreams left behind. Madge is sick of being the pretty one, Millie is sick of being the smart one, Rosemary is sick of being an old maid, Arthur is sick of not being a winner in his father's eyes. "Picnic" contains some memorable scenes, the best remembered being the classic "Moonglow" sequence when Madge shuns tradition and gives into her womanly feelings in one of the most erotic scenes ever filmed.William Holden is too old for the role for Hal (his classmate, played by Cliff Robertson, is 29) but his casting is excellent. Virile, oozing with sex appeal and good looks, Hal turns a lot of heads when he's shirtless and when he flashes his gorgeous smile. In Madge, he sees his last chance to make something of himself; with her as his inspiration, he can do anything. Gorgeous in lavender, Kim Novak's Madge is every man's dream, and as she makes evident in her scenes with Robertson, she isn't sure this is all there is. When she meets Hal, he awakens feelings in her she's never had. Betty Field does a beautiful job as Flo Owens, a woman whose life has been one of disappointment but hopes for a good marriage for Madge. Susan Strasberg as the geeky Millie is superb - tomboyish, with feelings for things other than English literature held inside. The main characters all believe their lives are on a set path. No one believes this more than Millie. "I will be living in New York and writing books no one reads," she announces to her sister. But it's she who convinces Madge that for the fearless, life doesn't have to be set in stone.Arthur O'Connell is effective as Rosemary's boyfriend - though he normally goes along with her, he can be tough when necessary. The scene where he's completely overcome by the town's women and can't get a word in is a classic. Arthur's afraid of change, but his life is going to change by unanimous female consent.One of the best performances comes from veteran Verna Felton as Mrs. Potts. Her final scene with Flo Owens is so poignant as she talks about what it's meant to her to watch Flo's daughters grow up while she cares for her invalid mother. When she meets Hal, it's as if her whole existence comes alive once again. "There was a man around, and it was good," she says. Felton essays a wonderful, wise woman with an understanding of life and love and makes the role shine.The problematic role is that of Rosemary. When people say that Picnic is dated, they're perhaps speaking of Rosemary, an old maid whose sexual desires become unbearable once she sees Hal and witnesses Hal and Madge together. "Every year I keep telling myself something will happen," she tearfully tells Howard. "But it doesn't." What's dated is the implication that an unmarried woman must be unfulfilled - the concept is dated, but it fits into '50s middle America - and don't kid yourself, step out of a big city and there are plenty of people who still feel this way. Rosemary's big confrontation scene with Howard is magnificent acting, but I frankly found Russell over the top in parts of the movie. Some of it is the character, some is not enough attention to directing her. Rosemary might be annoying, but she is also an object of pity. When you wish she'd just stop talking and leave, there's a problem."Picnic" doesn't tell us about the rest of these peoples' lives. The final scenes are really just the beginning. Though both Hal and Madge want to build a real life together, one wonders if they can, and if love and passion are enough to carry them through hard times. One suspects that Madge will one day return to Kansas, sadder but wiser. Hal will always have wanderlust, always put the best spin on marginal situations, and never really hold down a good job. Rosemary will be able to put on an act that she has what she wants, but that's all it will be. Without the competition of Madge, Millie may just surprise herself by blossoming, allowing the womanly part of her in, and have some opportunities in the big city that are more than career-based. In fact, of all of the characters, she perhaps has the best future in front of her.A slice of '50s life, thought provoking, excellent characterizations - Picnic is one of the best films of the '50s with two of its brightest stars. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Small Town America According To William Inge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is so much to enjoy in this American melodrama with a deliciously miscast William Holden and a gelid, beautiful Kim Novak that the film can be seen again and again without being disturbed by the 40 year old Holden playing the drop out stallion trying to make amends with his past forging a sort of future for himself, at least that's what I think he wants and I'm sticking with that notion. Holden plays the loser with his shiny boots and smallish brain and that's what reminds us this is just a romantic drama thought by William Inge with a patina of reality and that's all that is real, the patina. I didn't care that emotionally couldn't play because emotionally worked for me thanks to the sexual power of the miscast star. William Holden is a sort of God who awakes the (seemingly) heavily sedated Novak into a towering passion. I would have too. The supporting cast is sensational. Rosalind Russell is a jarring masterpiece of an over the top clich?. The old maid, school teacher with a taste for alcohol and an understandable terror of her own future, overtaking her at an incredible speed. Susan Strasberg, in the part created by Kim Stanley on the Broadway stage is delightful but made me wonder what Kim Stanley may have done with that part. Betty Field is the one character that expresses the most saying the least. She, as per usual, is outstanding. All in all, a film/play that shouldn't be dismissed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poignant, bittersweet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like the surface simplicity of this movie, beneath which lie important questions: Can we be free of our ancestors' demons? Can love between two emotionally crippled people be healthy?Madge and Hal are -- probably tragically - made for each other. Each is a product of a broken home. Each wants to create a life worth living, despite family history, circumstances, and friends who expect little of them. My heart goes out to both of them. (The sad truth is that Madge's mother's warning will probably come true.)I love the ambiguity of the movie's ending. I read that William Inge (or was it the screenwriter?) had originally had Madge return to her five and dime deadend job. I much prefer the ending that Mr. Logan chose.Alcohol ought to be listed in the cast credits. It plays a big role at the picnic, and the effects of parental alcoholism pervade Hal's and Madge's lives.Roz Russell the town schoolmarm and Howard the shopkeeper provide delightfully lighthearted counterpoints.No car crashes, no karate. Just a simple story, simple setting, and timeless questions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Flawed Flick to Love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very Good movie, despite the flaws. A must for anyone into American mid-century drama. Beautifully filmed and written. Some excellent performances. The Good: Rosalind Russell, Arthur O'Connell, Betty Field, Susan Strasberg. The adequate: Kim Novak and Cliff Robertson. The not too great: William Holden. I'm not bothered by Novak's performance, she was often only as good as her director, and Joshua Logan was an entirely stagebound stylist. Holden on the other hand, is entirely miscast. Way too old for the character by at least 10 years. This is a meaty, sweaty, rebellious part suited to a young Paul Newman or James Dean, not a late '30's, already craggy faced William Holden (he was ideally suited for his Bridge on the River Kwai role). The reading of his lines is artificial and contrived, the pacing atrocious. It's really Logan's fault though. In every one of his films, characters, especially the supporting ones, end up performing like cartoon characters... (Betty Field in Bus Stop, Everyone in South Pacific and Fanny)... and in Picnic, Logan lets almost everyone go over the top with this kind of mannered, ill-paced stuff. However, I love this flick too... the story conquers the flaws, and it consistently pulls me in. Rosalind Russell (though she's allowed to go over the top too) and Arthur O'Connell have remarkable scenes together. Good Movie!</fullReview>

William Holden and Kim Novak are magnificent as small town lovers who face many complications because of his drifter background and her wealthy and important boyfriend. Besides the passionate story, it also features an unforgettable score. "Picnic" is a classic that should not, under any circumstances, be forgotten! See this movie!

		<shortDescription>Life In The 50's Wasn't Always A "Picnic"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Picnic (1955): Starring William Holden, Kim Novak, Betty Fields, Rosalind Russell, Cliff Robertson, Susan Strasberg, Verna Felton, Arthur O'Connell, Reta Shaw, Nick Adams, Raymond Bailey, Elizabeth Wilson, Steve Benton, Warren Frederick Adams, Carle E. Baker, George E. Bemis, Paul R. Cochran, Adlai Zeph Fisher, Harold A. Beyer, Shirley Knight, Phyllis Newman, Harry Sherman Schall, Henry Pagueo, Flomanita Jackson, Floyd Steinbeck, Abraham Weinlood....Director Joshua Logan, Screenplay Daniel Taradash.Based on the award-winning play by William Inge, a playwright who was at the level of his contemporaries Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams, this is director Joshua Logan's successful screen adaptation released in 1955. If ever there was a film that best represented the 1950's, this movie is it. There are certain elements within the "angst" story that evoke other classics such as "Rebel Without A Cause" and "Streetcar Named Desire". This is the story of an average small town in middle America in the 50's suddenly rocked by the tension and conflict brought on by the appearance of the newcomer, a former Hollywood actor and the ensuing rivalry between two sisters that desire him. For its time, this film was thoroughly modern and covered new ground in its realistic depiction of real life, a film that was far from the escapist nature of other 50's films such as Vincent Price horror films, Westerns, ancient-times epics and romantic comedies. The cast is very strong in their performance. William Holden (Sunsent Boulevard, Sabrina) was not only a well-known star at this time, but considered something of a veteran. He portrays Hal Carter, the good-looking, mature-aged actor who left California to seek a peaceful life in a small town in the Mid-West. Rosalind Russell is terrific as the school teacher Rosemary, a minor role but a great one. Holden's co-stars Kim Novak and Betty Field deliver strong performances as the Owens sisters Madge and Flo, each with their own issues and troubles, competing for his affection. Other fine performances by Verna Felton as Helen Potts, Cliff Robertson as Alan Benson and Susan Strasberg as the mother Millie Owens. Even the bit part portrayed by Shirley Knight is good. Other praiseworthy elements include the nostalgic 50's milieu via the music (songs "Moonglow", "It's A Blue World"), the costumes by Jean Louis which reflect the 50's down to the last detail and fine cinematography by James Wong Howe. As mentioned, this film's strength lies in its frank realism. The subtleties of sexual repression, frustration concerning lost dreams, the hope of a second chance, the tragic condition of living out-of-synch with the rest of the forward-moving world, issues about age, gender roles and other aspects covered in the terrific William Inge play, are done justice in this film, even if they fly right by you. This is unquestionably William Holden's best work, for he took a big risk in presenting himself in an entirely different light. He is not only intelligent as an actor, but oozes sensuality and animal magnetism coming close to being a sort of Marlon Brando, for this film anyways. While in the 50's some women were relegated to "sexy" types (Marilyn Monroe being the front runner), Holden boldly struts around the film without his shirt like a piece of man-meat for the women. This is a well-made film and a fine document in an era that was not as "nifty" as you think it was. The sad quality of this film, the drama of real life and the accurate representation of life is what makes this film a winner. The 50's are suddenly less rose-colored and far more complex when you see this powerful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nice Package With Disappointing Contents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rebecca: This is so bad it's almost good. Enid: This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again."Picnic" is hardly the only example of Joshua Logan's limitations as a director. Logan's small body of directing work is highlighted by two of the worst screen adaptations of good Broadway musicals ever produced: "Paint Your Wagon"and "Camelot". His "South Pacific" was a happy exception. After doing some second unit directing on "Mister Roberts" he was turned loose to direct the sequel "Ensign Pulver"; a compare and contrast of the two films provides a nice illustration of Logan's talent limitations. That said he was badly served by Daniel Taradash's adaptation of the William Inge novel. Inge's subtle nuanced story is turned into a something midway between "A Place In the Sun" and "State Fair". In the adaptation 19-year old small town beauty Marge (Kim Novak) is crowned Queen of Neewollah (Halloween spelled backward), the highlight of her town's annual Labor Day picnic. Marge spends most of her time complaining about wanting more from a man than just being looked at because she is pretty. Enter Hal Carter (William Holden), a moronic but pretty drifter who comes through the town for one day. Marge takes some time off from complaining about being looked at to look at Hal because he is pretty. And when Hal is not busy being a moron or talking about himself he looks at Marge because she is pretty. Since this is all he does he must have made Marge rethink her need for anything more than a man who looks at her because she is pretty. There are a few secondary story lines. Marge's sister Millie (Susan Strasberg) spends her time complaining because she's not pretty enough for men to look at her. Old-maid schoolteacher Rosemary (Rosalind Russell) spends her time complaining because she is no longer pretty enough for men to look at her. Alan (Cliff Robertson), one of the men who has been looking at Marge, spends his time complaining that Marge prefers being looked at by Hal. Howard (Arthur O'Connell) complains that he can't do anything more than look at Marge. This is pretty much the whole story although there is also a documentary feature edited into the middle of the film that features tons of stuff you would find at a small town picnic; like pie- eating contests, sack races, concerts, jam and jelly judging, crying babies-laughing babies- frowning babies, and surreptitious drinking. Ironically while "Picnic" is Holden's all-time worst acting performance, his propensity to take off all or part of his shirt is the main reason for the film's popularity with certain viewers who like that sort of thing. Holden could believably play anti-heros (see "Stalag 17" and "Sunset Blvd") but not dumb ones and Hal's most prominent character trait is stupidity. Novak (as in all her straight dramatic roles) looks scared about having a camera pointed in her direction-she eventually learned to do comedy pretty well but in "Picnic" comedy is in short supply. Novak also does not benefit from having a lot of scenes with Strasberg, who was not just a real actress but was such a physical opposite that there is not even a hint of a sisterly dynamic. Robertson is actually very good, managing to make most of his terribly lame dialogue work. And the TCM version is a restored wide-screen print which nicely showcases the film's strengths; editing and production design. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you wanted to make a heterosexual training/recruitment film you'd really have to try and outdo this oddity about fertility &amp; harvesting (wink, wink), mired as it is in the '50s psyche.Every type of heterosexual imaginable is getting their mack on (guys) at the big Midwest picnic, or playing coy as a tease before getting it on (gals). The whole thing is about a male's attempt to push past a female's many socially proscribed moral barriers, to get her to put out. And hierarchically, there's no higher place in the echelon than being the guy who nails the hot chick. The non-sexualized have a place in the social pecking order too, they entertain - nerds in the glee club, old nerds in barbershop quartets, frumps with the various tasks they assign themselves. Even the product of reproduction (babies) gets their own very unsubtle moment. A structuralist would have a field day with this movie. It's all wrapped up in an allegory of seasons (It's the fall, the fertile cycle is ending). Rosalind Russell is particularly nasty/resentful that those whose blossoms are fading are not allowed to pretend it's springtime. Every once in a while, in case you've forgotten the movie is about doing it, a phallic symbol hits you over the head. My favorite is an intimate moment between Kim Novak, William Holden and a diesel train (!). This being the '50s everyone in the whole freaking universe MUST attend the picnic. There's no cutaway to anything else happening back in town - because non-conformity will not be tolerated. Kim Novak wins the big prettiness crown, and follows it up with a heartfelt promise "not to get conceited," that is, not to claim too much power in lording her sexuality over the men. Cause that's just not cool, in 1955. The movie is also memorable for depicting the rotten, smalltown social order in which retched, manipulative, loud-mouthed hens somehow come out on top.It wants to be important but it just acts as a dated, overwrought product to allow horny audiences in 1955 to start addressing the topic of how horny everyone is. It's only slightly more subtle than an STD awareness film. As heavy-handed as this is, the worst scenes are not as bad as those in Splendor in the Grass (Pat Hingle's terrible acting and his idiot family), but that's also true for the best scenes. Splendor is a better movie. I don't think Holden ever convinced me on film that he was passionate about anything. He's just reciting lines. But the flimsy script isn't helping him. Will he end up with Kim Novak forever? Unlikely, Don't know, but I'm indifferent. Undermining his professions of ardor is that a man can't actually voice what he wants in 1955, and has to voice twee, feminine remarks about love and marriage (both to cater to female modesty, and filmic moral codes) when every cell in his body is really only interested in getting into her panties. More interesting is how agricultural buildings (silage towers) are used to spatialize the lives of these characters, and provide some sense of awe, in the middle of Kansas. And Inge's small milieus are the earliest vestiges of showing the humble, drab but also very real, vivid places people actually hail from in America. Certainly worth a look, for Inge completists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mid '50s Soaper Not Believable Enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like 1950s soap operas, this is your cup of tea. It's not mine. I did enjoy the first half hour and I appreciated the nice slice-of-life from the mid '50s rural America, but it dragged for me after that opening 30 minutes.Bill Holden was 37 years old when he made the film - and looked it - so his casting as a 20-something is a little dubious. Kim Novak's dialog and general uneasiness made me uneasy watching her. And, once again we get the exaggerated morally-uptight character, this one a schoolteacher played by Rosalind Russell. All this rebellion against morals and religion began to surface in these 1950 films and then went full bore by the end of the next decade. When someone suggests to Holden that he go to a Baptist bible study, Susan Strassburg rolls her eyes with obvious disdain.If read the video box, the dance between Holden and Novak was supposed to be really "sexy," but it was absolutely nothing.....except false advertising. At least this is shown on a nice widescreen transfer which is visually appealing, especially when you have the great James Wong Howe as the chief photographer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Must Have Been Moonglow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw Picnic was from the smoke filled balcony of my neighborhood Loew's movie theatre on a warm spring Friday night in 1955. I was eight years old, and was with my mother. I kept falling asleep, and waking up with my eyes watery from all the smoke. I only mention this because this was the first time I saw Kim Novak in a movie, and immediately fell in love with her, thinking her the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. Now all these many years later, and after seeing Picnic several times, the last being a few months ago on the newly restored letterboxed dvd, I can happily state that the Picnic is still fine and tasty after all these years. And although no longer in love with Ms. Novak, I still think she was one of the best looking female movie stars of the late 1950's, and also very underrated as an actress. The movie was based on the well received play by the tragic William Inge, who killed himself in the early 70's, and covers a short span of time in the lives of a family living in a small town in Kansas. Theres the single mom Flo Owens played by the fine Betty Field, and her two daughters, beautiful Madge played by Novak and younger tomboy Millie (a standin perhaps for a young Inge) played by Susan Stasberg. Into their dreary lives comes William Holden, a drifter with a past and a real nice smooth chest. He soon turns things upside down &amp; inside out and although its been pointed out many times that Holden was too old for the role, I don't agree. Watching him sway swagger and move you can understand why Novak and most of the other women in the film would be taken in by him, you can feel the sexual tension cracking &amp; sizzling like a summer lighting storm. Novak is engaged to the town rich kid, played by Cliff Robertson also young and handsome, but as soon as la Novak catches sight of Holden with his shirt off, its bye bye Cliff and hello Bill. Moma Betty is aghast at the thought of her queen of the picnic taking up with a no good bum like Holden and giving up her chance for the good life. Holden who just so happens to have gone to college with Robertson, is in town to look him up and hit him for a job at his old man's plant. Also hanging around is Rosalind Russell who is a spinster school teacher boarding with the Owens, and her timid boyfriend Howard played by Arthur O' Connell. Both are fine, and Russell especially has some great moments especially her drunken scene at the picnic, and her begging Howard to marry her. Silly Roz gave up her sure shot of winning a supporting Oscar for this film, because she refused to be considered as a supporting player. Too bad, because she is wonderful. Of course one cannot fail to mention the sexy erotic dance at the picnic between Novak and Holden, which is still one of the great sex scenes ever filmed. Directed by Joshua Logan who filmed on location and used many of the town folks as extras, the film has a nice feel to it. The lengthy actual picnic of the title is especially fine. Also of note is James Wong Howe's beautiful soft pastel color cinematography, George Dunings score, Jo Mielziner's production design and the great aeriel shot at the end of the film. One of the memorable films of the 1950s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aging poorly, in a funny way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seen from a distance of over 50 years, the once-daring "Picnic" barely emerges from the background of stage drama and silent movies that came before it. It is, in the way of most '50s Hollywood films, deliriously artificial in manner, though the settings look real, and are. Its only excellent performance is by the grain-belt town where the exteriors were filmed.Picnic asks us to accept a mid-30s and facially haggard (but tanned and very fit) William Holden as a post-collegiate. That could work in a play, where acting, body language and makeup could make us believe. But here he looks a lot older than his college chum Cliff Robertson. Holden is game and fearless, but is directed to a performance that is hammy, frantic, almost awkward. He moves big and impulsive, like Elizabeth Berkley in "Showgirls."Holden generally just doesn't seem right for a likable if show-offy lummox with a disreputable side. He's intrinsically a man's man, a Don Draper prototype, a wordly cynic, not someone who's going to mask his insecurities and shame with puppy-ish fratboy physicality. That much of this energy is directed at tiny, under-age Susan Strasberg, his "date" for the big picnic (before his real love interest is revealed), seems creepy to 21st century sensibilities.Other apparent age anomalies include Kim Novak and her mom looking to be about 12 years apart.The director gives his actors stagy bits of physical business that make the most normal gestures--hanging onto the ropes of a swing or the columns of a porch while speaking--look forced.This is the corny kind of a movie where when a character thinks of the whole wide world outside of Kansas, then their eyes have to loft achingly upward of the horizon. To me the film's loud, broad and energized acting and brisk editing suggest a sort of terror of the bucolic setting and overtly prosaic title as being threats to the searing, sexed-up realism that was being attempted. The performances play to the back rows, lobbing one uninflected emotion at a time, and the characters fairly frequently blurt out just how they feel, even before the bottle gets passed around. Seems among these salt-of-the-earth Midwestern types, only the stuffy schoolmarm has any use for any pretense or posturing. Rosalind Russell's Romemarie still just about beats her head with her own limbs like a Tex Avery wolf when Holden takes his shirt off. Subtle. Scenes like this make this wide screen Technicolor epic feel like it was directed for the iPod.There are bits that work. Arthur O'Connell escaped with his dignity and an Oscar. By being authentically good, he excels here. The actress who played Kim Novak's mom, while generally acting as if in a silent melodrama, does manage to beautifully project mingled worry and sympathetic excitement for her daughter near the end. One key scene between O'Connell and Russell is done in one long take and as the scene goes on, they seem to emerge from the cloud of recently whispered dunderheaded directorial instructions, escaping to something authentic and touching.A vastly over-celebrated film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where is MST3K when you need it? "Picnic" had me resurrecting this late 80s fad: Conflicted belle shirks marrying for money for a deeper passion - NOT! Irrestible 20-something drops out of college and out of his boxcar into the roiling undercurrents of a... picnic - NOT! Gracefully aging spinster displays resilience and inner strength grappling with the gender roles of her day - TRIPLE NOT! Holden's bluster and swagger had me wanting a film noir ending of some sort. He looks ruggedly hot as usual, but nowhere near the age he's supposed to be. Bogie could have been cast to similar effect.Novak expressionlessly drones about being tired of being looked at, only to throw over the local nice guy for a booty call with a sexy dancer she has known for all of six hours - the sort of charmer with lines like "you asked for it".She's egged on in her non-mutual romance by her social-climbing mother, who in countering Novak's objection that she is only nineteen, displays a knack for non-linear mathematics: "Next year you'll be 20, then 21, and then...40!"The movie never succeeds in making us care for the main characters. There is an attempt at exploring Holden's inner conflict, but in the balance of things, he's more creepy than compelling, while Novak wins the Oscar for "Best Blank Expression" in most scenes. But Russell's "spinster school marm" performance is the nadir of the whole affair. Acting with all the poise of a tipsy Old West bar maid, she literally rips Holden's shirt off in public then (also literally) throws herself at a long-time boyfriend the next morning. And when, implausibly, he goes through with the ceremony, she sticks her tongue out at the school on the way by.The only likable character is the ditched boyfriend. What is so repellent to Novak's character? He's cute, nice, rich and until the picnic, has even settled for kissing when they park. More to the point, he is going out with her against his father's wishes and stands up to the old man about it.At least I came away with some ideas for my next picnic, like the octogenarian balloon blowing contest. I'll have to watch that scene again, it was an emotional high point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>William Holden is terribly miscast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know William Holden has given many great performances in other movies. But he is far too old for the part in Picnic and his performance almost destroys an otherwise fantastic movie. He is terribly unlikeable, his delivery of some of the lines is so unconvincing (every time he calls Kim Novak "baby" I cringe). On the other hand, the performances of the rest of the cast, especially Rosalind Russell as a crusty old maid school teacher are fantastic. The picnic itself is beautifully depicted and makes me think of those innocent days gone by when people lived in the same town for decades rather than months. It's a shame that a young Paul Newman, for example, wasn't cast in the role played by William Holden. If he had been, the movie would be elevated to super classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>50's small town Americana</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't terribly impressed with this film. It is pure melodrama wrapped in a soap opera.There are several things I don't quite get about this film. First of all how could they cast a 37 year old William Holden in the male lead as a not-so-long out of college boy. And to put Kim Novak as his love interest who was only 21 at the time. Not only was Holden miscast, but I have also never understood all the adoration given Kim NOvak, First of all, she really is not all that attractive, but rather ordinary looking. In here, she actually looks a little overweight. And I have never been impressed with her acting skills. She always comes across as sullen and sulking.I did find the Kansas location shooting interesting and loved the glimpse it gave into life in the 50's. I especially liked the scenes from the picnic at the fairgrounds - with all the classic races (3-legged races, "carry the girl", "throw the rolling pin") - what a hoot. There were plenty of cute, fat baby shots, kids laughing and playing, pie eating contests, music at the band stand and of course the crowning of the "Neewollah Queen" (Halloween spelled backwards). I will have to say that I found it a little creepy when all the spectators were chanting and bowing to her - it looked like a cult gathering.Another thing I didn't get was all the publicity around the "Moonglow dance sequence". I had to go back through the movie again to even pick it out - because it didn't even stand out to me the first time. It really was nothing special. Except for the fact that apparently Holden had to get knee-walking drunk to even play the scene since he couldn't dance. And then he demanded an extra $8000 for stuntman premium.So if you want to see a glimpse into 1950's American life in the Mid-west - but with an extreme dose of melodrama - then by all means, take a "Picnic".</fullReview>

She gives a breakfast to Hal and he meets her next door neighbor, the gorgeous Marjorie "Madge" Owens (Kim Novak) that is Alan's girlfriend. Then Hal is welcomed by Alan that invites him to go to the local picnic with Madge's younger sister Millie Owens (Susan Strasberg). Hal is a braggart, but attractive and gentle, and he becomes successful with the local girls. However, he falls in love with Madge and Alan feels betrayed by his best friend."Picnic" is a dated and not believable romance, but also delightful to see. I saw this film for the first day on VHS on 29 January 2003 and in that occasion I liked it more than now. I have just seen this film again on DVD and I found the thirty-seven year old William Holden absolutely miscast in the role of a youngster of twenty and something years old. When the spinster Rosemary (Rosalind Russell) has an argument with Hal and asks him to look himself in the mirror, William Holden is already an older man and the scene loses the impact. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Férias de Amor" ("Vacation of Love")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Subtle As A Buffalo Stampede</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A small-town household of women become fascinated by a drifter's hormones--and on the stage William Inge's subtle and intimate tale of sexual frustration, lost opportunities, and the mythical promise of youth proved popular with both audiences and critics alike. On the other hand, Joshua Logan's screen version has brassy good looks--and is about as subtle and intimate as a buffalo stampede down Main Street at high noon.Director Logan made his name as a theatrical director by staging big budget productions with plenty of stage picture, so it should come as no surprise that his handling of this material is both stagy and way too literal. Both Novak and Holden are too old for their roles, but more to the point they are both wildly miscast. Novak's stunning beauty and cool self-assurance is completely at odds with the role of Madge, an unsure small-town pretty girl; Holden, although he had his share of virile charm, lacks the mix of innocence and raw sexuality his role requires. As a couple, they seem to belong to an entirely different movie.On the plus side, PICNIC offers an interesting if occasionally problematic score that features the memorable "Moonglow;" some very nice if largely inappropriate cinematography; and a truly fine supporting cast, with Arthur O'Connell and Rosalind Russell standouts in the cast. But not even Russell's brilliant turn as the determinedly over-compensating spinster school teacher can ignite this film, which for all its good looks never comes to life. Worth seeing once, but you're better off catching a stage revival at a good rep company.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie doesn't do the story justice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You get the feeling that with a different leading man and leading lady that this movie could have been great, but as it is, it just winds up being good entertainment.William Holden is at least ten years too old for the part of a young man floating through life (he was 36 at the time). His attempts at playing an exuberant college jock turned drifter fall flat. The lines he speaks just don't fit the image of William Holden - this movie came out five years after he played the worldly cynic, Joe Gillis, in "Sunset Boulevard."And Kim Novak's character isn't very appealing. Her main angst in life is that she's pretty and that's all people care about. But she doesn't transform herself during the course of the movie, which is what one would expect. She's just as vacuous at the end when she tells Hal Carter (Holden) that she'll run off with him when the time comes.The more interesting of the two sisters, and the sexier and more appealing at least to my eye, was Susan Strasberg.Other great characters in the movie were Rosalind Russell as an over-the-top old maid with the hots for William Holden. Her scene with Arthur O'Connell (Jimmy Stewart's drinking buddy in "Anatomy of a Murder") where she breaks down and begs him to marry her was among the best in the movie. Verna Felton plays the kindly older woman everyone wishes they had for a neighbor.There are some nostalgic shots of Fifties Americana at the picnic which centers the story, but the main characters just never grabbed me the way the author, William Inge, intended. Holden and Novak are both miscast as young lovers and their acting is awkward at times, particularly Novak's at the beginning of the film. There seems to be a disconnect between the lines spoken and the acting. Cliff Robertson adds nothing to the role of the rich kid in this love triangle either.Entertaining, but that's about all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The William Inge play upon which the film is based was a biting look at the prejudicial and insular communities of small-town America. In out-of-town runs, Joshua Logan (who directed both play and film) discerned that audiences preferred a more positive viewpoint, resulting in the story we see on screen. Logan also opened up the play's one set to include the entire community very effectively, better than most stage-to-film productions.This may be my favorite film of all time. There is so much to like, from the script to the acting, from the music to the editing.With the changes made by Logan, Picnic is--at its heart--a love story. William Holden plays Hal Carter, a young man who drifts into a small Kansas town and meets Madge Owens (Kim Novak), the beautiful daughter of a woman who is grooming her for marriage to a young man from a well to do family. Madge feels trapped by the expectations of her mother and the entire town, a victim of her own beauty.Holden plays Hal as someone who is desperate. He feels time passing him by. With no prospects on the horizon, he blows into town to see his old college buddy, Alan Benson (Cliff Robertson), hoping to find a job. Hal has a chip on his shoulder and projects a façade of confidence that is easy to see through.Madge is desperate in her own way. She wants to establish her own identity, but she is playing a role proscribed for her by the town. As queen of the annual fall festival, she is a virginal offering to the gods of propriety and tradition.All of the actors in this film do tremendous jobs. I must single out Rosalind Russell who plays Miss Rosemary Sydney, a middle-aged school teacher who boards in the Owens household. She too is desperate, feeling doomed to live the remainder of her life without fulfilling her dreams of marriage with all its trappings. Like Hal, she puts on a brave front, but the film's narrative brings her to a point where she is stripped of pretensions and the viewer sees and feels her desperation. I always wondered why Russell did not receive the Academy Award for this multi-leveled, gut-wrenching performance. Then I read that she was upset that she was not billed as the female lead. After years of top billing and box office success, she was billed below Kim Novak--a relative newcomer. So, she asked that she not be considered for Best Supporting Actress. This is one of her best performances.Picnic gives us so many memorable scenes--from the scenes of the fall festival, to the dancing scene between Holden and Novak, to the final scene of the film. Some of the best scenes take place in the plot of grass that lies between the back of the Owens house and the alley that borders the backyards. When Hal first arrives in town, broke and travel-weary, he walks down that alley and observes another world, where families live and interact, where there is a sense of belonging. He knows that if he can make his way from the outside world represented by the alley to the inside world represented by the back steps of the houses, he might gain access to another world, with its vague promise of a better life.As a young man looking to find his place in life, Holden's portrayal of Hal deserves to be elevated to iconic status, along with the rebels of Brando and Dean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This will be no picnic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This picture could be an artifact of the naive and childish romantic notions of the fifties and the plight of women at that time. The audience is asked to suspend reality on too many levels, the first being William Holden as a drop-dead gorgeous young stud. At 37, Holden was prematurely old from alcohol. Even with his shaved chest (which was supposed to make him look younger), he seems closer to 50. All of the gusto and even the lust are forced. Hal would have been an ideal role for Paul Newman or Marlon Brando at that time; maybe Joshua Logan just hated method actors. It would be understandable as to why Kim Novak, the Village Beauty, would dump the richest boy in town (Cliff Robertson) for a loser with no prospects. He would need to have overpowering sex appeal while Holden just appears used-up. In this situation, you can't help but feel for Betty Field's character who knows Madge's life will be a disaster once she marries Hal. The best outcome is that Madge will divorce him before she loses her looks. How audiences, at that time, could consider her union with Hal a happy ending is symptomatic of how delusional and pathetic the nineteen fifties were.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kim Novak in film version of 1953 Pulitzer winning play.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kim Novak is perhaps my favorite actress of all time and lately I have been getting copies of her old movies from my local county library. "Picnic" the 1953 play won a Pulitzer prize, and I suppose it was only natural to turn it into this 1955 movie version. That also holds it back from being great, much of the dialog and gestures play better on the stage. Still it is a very nice film to showcase Kim Novak's beauty and acting skills, as a pretty girl in a small Kansas town whose feelings are summed in this line, "I get so tired of just being told I'm pretty." It may have also been her thoughs in real life, which would have explained why she is so perfect for the role. No new ground is broken in this story, which happens over a 24-hour period on Labor Day and the town picnic that runs into the next morning. However it is in total a very nice 113-minute viewing experience.The rest of my comments contain SPOILERS for my own recollection, you may not want to read further, OK??Hal (Holden, 38), dumb jock and college dropout, arrives in town broke and hungry, does yard work for breakfast, Madge (Kim Novak, 22) notices him without shirt, Hal looks up old college buddy Alan whose father is a wealthy grain elevator magnate, hoping for a job, something cush, a nice office and a pretty secretary. Alan advises him to be patient, maybe he can start as a grain scooper! Hal takes younger sister Millie to the picnic, whole town, many very silly games, band playing, groups singing, pie-eating contest, 8PM dance, Hal dances with Madge, it is clear they are smitten with each other, whiskey is consumed, old maid teacher Rosemary gropes Hal, tears his shirt, Hal is accused of boozing up the ladies, insulted, he leaves angry in Alan's car, Madge goes with him, refuses to get out of car, goes to river, eventually takes Madge home, goes to Alan's, is accused of stealing car, really angry for stealing girlfriend, ask cops to arrest Hal, who fights, runs, gets help from Howard, sees Madge one last time in morning before hopping a rail car, first tells Madge he loves her, later after Millie convinces her there is more than staying in their small town, takes a bus to Tulsa to look up Hal. She says, "Mom, you don't have to love someone because he's perfect." Ending with sky level shot of train moving through the fields.I was growing up in the 1950s, I remember how my 3 older sisters, their friends, and our parents looked at "beauty". It was thought to be quite an accomplishment when my second sister won "Miss Oberlin" and made my two other sisters a bit jealous. So the theme of Picnic, where everyone seems to be focused on the "prettiness" of a girl is quite accurate. Also, the quest of young men to marry a "pretty girl", which was considered quite a trophy. Times have changed and things have changed, for the better, making "Picnic" dated in its main theme.Hal is not genuine, full of "BS", appears to only care for himself, had spent time as a kid in a reform school for stealing a motorcyle, by all indications a troubled and dangerous person. He was the opposite of his old college friend Alan. Alan needed a pretty girl with ambitions only to be a rich wife and good mother. Madge was not that type of girl, she wanted excitement, and she found that in Hal. A theme that has played many times on stage and in the movies, and reflective of real life. There's also a very amusing side story of Rosemary the spinster school teacher who in the end gets Howard to marry her through sheer willpower. At one point, a bit drunk after the picnic, says "Please marry me Howard." When he showed up later to tell her he was just too busy, she didn't even give him a chance to say anything, simply assumed he had come back to marry her and off they went.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Picnic - William Holden blows into town(well he hitches a ride on a train)- the Owens sisters Madge(Kim Novak) and Millie both like him at first sight- a classic pretty sister/smart sister combo - of course Holden is smitten with Novak at first sight- and of course Madge is dating his best friend from college(Cliff Robertson)- The m interesting relationship in the film is between Rosiland Russell as an old maid teacher and her boyfriend.While she takes her bf for granted she suddenly realizes that she needs him. Holden was 37 when he made this film- he felt that he was too old for his role and while he was right- he looked like Cliff Robertson's father more than his frat brother- he was riveting in this movie- although he had trouble keeping his shirt on.This is an interesting look at female roles in society and had some neat scenes of Americana- with the picnic scenes with the games and families and shenanigans.Parts of this movie seem quaint and some lines of dialogue seem out of place coming out of the miscast William Holden's mouth- but I enjoyed this movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>that William Holden</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although an enjoyable film, Picnic falls sort in the casting department. I'm somewhat of a William Holden fan - Sunset Boulevard is one of my top 5 films. Still, try as he might, I think he's just too old (I think he was 38), to play a mixed up kid in this movie. In reality, he's much closer to the age of Madge's mom than Madge. Kim Novac, in what I believe is her first screen role, is inexperienced in the acting arts, and it shows. She's marvelous in the dancing scene with Holden, but other wise stumbles about it a zombie like state. I find it quite difficult to get caught up in her situation - "people only say I'm pretty" or something like that. The subplot is something that grabbed my attention. The interplay between Rosalind Russel and Arther O'Connell always gives me a chuckle, no matter how many times I watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I like American films of this period</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film comes from an era when there was an atmospheric magic to the production values, and the use of film music, as were others of the same period, e.g. East Of Eden and Rebel Without A Cause. As has been mentioned elsewhere, there was a certain chemistry in the pairing of William Holden and Kim Novak which really reaches its climax in the fascinating dance that brings them together to music of the the Picnic title tune. Probably one of the most understated, intimate, and romantic dances in the history of film. Not one of the greatest films of all time, but one which holds your interest from beginning to end, and leaves you with a feeling of satisfied enjoyment, at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful but awkward</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A beautifully shot and acted film (for the most part) suffers from awkward staging and has believeability problems. The director can't seem to make up his mind whether it's going to be a filmed play (like "Long Day's Journey into Night") or a real movie adaptation of a play.As for the acting, everyone is excellent with one notable exception - Kim Novak has the same problem that her character does. She's pretty and the camera loves her, but her performance leaves you wondering if she understood the story at all. Her famous dance with William Holden is very sexy, but she plays it completely wrong, with absolutely no character or expression. Rosalind Russell, with her incredible unrestrained performance, just makes her Novak look that much worse.My favorite scene is the one where Russell has just pleaded with O'Connell to marry her. He's driving away and she clutches one of the posts on the porch, underneath the sign "Room For Rent". If there was ever an image that summed up the lives of women in the 1950s, this was it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magical, glowing, haunting film about desperate kind of love...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PICNIC is a stunning film version of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play by William Inge who had a knack for exposing the underbellies of desperate characters caught up in a heat wave of lusty appetites when a drifter (WILLIAM HOLDEN) comes to a Kansas town, steals his buddies' girlfriend, and stirs up a lot of angst among the natives who react to his magnetic presence with differing viewpoints.WILLIAM HOLDEN is excellent as Hal, perhaps a bit too old for the role at thirty-five, but enormously effective, as is KIM NOVAK as the prettiest girl in town who is attracted to him immediately. Their big dance scene to the sensuous "Moonglow and Picnic Theme" is a high point of the drama, for it's also the scene where prim schoolteacher ROSALIND RUSSELL, after too many drinks, throws herself at the handsome Holden and tears his shirt off in his struggle to release her grip. Russell is good in the role, but I vividly recall how much more effective Eileen Heckart was as the desperate Rosemary on the stage.BETTY FIELD, ARTHUR O'CONNELL (as Russell's last hope for marriage), SUSAN STRASBERG (as the awkward younger sister) and CLIFF ROBERTSON (in his film debut) all register strongly. Handsomely photographed in CinemaScope and color and backed by a strong background score by George Durning, it's a winner in every respect.Summing up: Absolutely top-rate film, stunning to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Small town soap operas really aren't my cup of tea as a rule but this one is, on the whole, a superior offering despite the fact that it has a few problems.Joshua Logan's direction resulted in many of the scenes being played in a style which was far too theatrical and over the top for the screen (Logan was, of course, primarily a stage director...and a highly successful one too!) Although William Holden strikes me as being too old for the role he's playing he injects his usual shot of sheer brilliance into the picture. Kim Novak is photogenic and .. well ..photogenic. The rest of the cast mainly consisted of reliable and competent players who had been around for some time. But, again, their performances were occasionally hijacked due to inconsistent and confusing direction. When Logan was able to switch his mind into "movie mode" rather than "stage mode", however, everything went just fine. Particularly noteworthy is a very young Susan Strasberg who plays Novak's sister. Strasberg successfully creates one of the most interesting characterizations in the whole show displaying an extraordinary level of skill and versatility which belied her tender years.In regard to the look of the film, some pretty colors and nice visuals add much to the enjoyment quota and the memorable theme tune is now very evocative of the era."Picnic" was a major box office hit. It provides a generally pleasant and occasionally powerful viewing experience for those who enjoy this type of movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exploration of the stages of women's lives.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The more I see this film the more I am impressed with its depth of understanding of the stages of women's lives, from the high schooler with newly awakening sexuality (Millie, played by Susan Strassbourg); to the newly mature but sexually unfulfilled beautiful young woman (Madge, played by Kim Novak); the over-protective mother (Flo); the elderly woman (Mrs. Potts) and even her mother, omnipresent but never seen invalid, and the loveless old maid school teacher (Rosemary, played by Rosalind Russell). Their small-town lives are serene but without vitality until a virile young William Holden (Hal) shows up and - in the course of a day - unwittingly rocks the foundations of their lives with his unabashed sexuality. Millie swoons, Flo is terrified that Hal will lure Madge from the insipid but wealthy Alan, played by Cliff Robertson, which he innocently does. Rosemary finally acknowledges the emptiness of her life and her need for love. Only Mrs. Potts welcomes his vitality and masculinity, saying it was good to have a man about the place. Indeed, Hal unleashes all of the women's repressed emotions, in the process liberating the beautiful but insecure Madge to explore her sexuality and find a life of her own, instead of one in which she is the projection of what her mother and boyfriend want her to be. The "Moonglow" dance sequence crystalizes how men and women fall in love when sexual desire transcends social convention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slim pickings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film couldn't have been made in any other decade but the 50's. Filmed in the elongated, vividly coloured wide-screen CinemaScope style of the day, it must have looked great on the big screen in the movie palaces back then. I also suspect it couldn't have been made in any other decade with its emergent adult themes in the wake of the revolution wrought by the success of "A Streetcar Named Desire". Itself based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning play, it's a tale of small-town ambitions, nascent sexuality and family conflict, triggered by William Holden's rebellious drifter arriving in town to shake up the locals and stir up a hornet's nest of emotions in his wake. The centrepiece of the film is the town's annual picnic where everyone attends what's more like an outdoor festival culminating in the crowning of a young beauty as the "Neewollah Queen".Principal amongst those affected by Holden's arrival is a struggling single-parent family of a middle-aged mother fonder of her younger, more intelligent but also rebellious, tomboyish daughter Millie who's into smoking, reading modern literature and against being cast as a conventional "lace and curls" young girl. Her older sister Madge, played by Kim Novak in her breakthrough role is the town beauty, soon to be the Neewollah Queen, just entering womanhood, but stereotypically assumed to be shallow and dumb, groomed by her mother into marriage with Cliff Robertson as the handsome but dull son of the local business tycoon, owner of the town's grain mills. When Holden turns up unannounced to stay next door with the family's good-natured elderly neighbour and later proposition old college chum Robertson for a job, sparks fly and conventions are broken over the course of the big picnic day. There's a sub-plot involving Rosalind Russell's ageing spinster teacher who initially scorns her boring middle-aged wooer Howard, but her emotions too get heightened by Holden's arrival turning her into a simpering, desperate man-eating woman who'll do anything to avoid being left on the shelf.Partly because of the second-hand nature of the plot, as a film it doesn't grab the viewer the way "Streetcar" did. Worse, Holden is several years too old for his part, looking positively fatherly in his scenes with Novak and even Robertson (not helped by both of them looking so young) and certainly doesn't possess the rebelliousness or physicality of Brando, his shirtless introduction at the start of the film only emphasising the point. Novak however is excellent as the awakening young girl who eventually rejects her stereotyping as the dim-witted beauty and shoo-in dutiful wife-to-be of Robertson. Russell was much praised at the time for her role as the frustrated teacher but I couldn't quite follow her character's reverse development, even if it is clearly set out as the opposite of the younger Novak's journey to a more-rewarding self-expression, plus the old-dear overacts for Kansas.For me the only time the film really came alive was in the celebrated dance scene at the picnic when Novak is first drawn to Holden, although its unquestionably her sexuality and sexiness which powers the scene. The direction by Joshua Logan, is only stolid however and while it features the famous helicopter high-aspect shot at the end in a rare moment of imagination, at other times there are some jarringly bad edits, most obviously in the intimate scenes between Novak and Holden and Russell and her man.One can only imagine what a Brando or Dean might have made of Holden's part but the film fails to compensate for this fatal casting error and correspondingly must be judged a failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Slice of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always very much enjoyed this film about a drifter (William Holden) who wanders into a small, dormant Kansas town and over the course of only a day breathes new life into it and stirs passions among its residents. "Picnic," has its faults. And there are many: the miscasting of William Holden, who was far too old (37) to play a young drifter looking to find his way in life, Kim Novak's breathy performance that takes on a mannequin like quality which leaves no room for the necessary chemistry between her and Holden, Rosalind Russell playing to the rafters (although she does nail her most important scene ? the one where she lashes out at Holden), and finally the way the musical score pounds loudly as the melodrama is poured on in the last act."Picnic" also lacks the lyrical quality of the great Douglas Sirk melodramas of the same era ("Imitation of Life"), but maybe its nostalgia for a time and place gone by or the way director Joshua Logan nails the sleepy life of an American town that is just waiting eagerly to be awoken. Or maybe it is James Wong Howe's brilliant widescreen cinematography or the wonderful performances from Verna Felton, Susan Strasberg and Arthur O'Connell that allows me to forgive the film's faults and treasure it for what it is: a beautifully shot melodrama that perfectly captures a slice of Americana.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lesser in whole than in parts...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many fine scenes in this film make it one to see. Many fine performances as well. However, there are some scenes that are weak and performances in such scenes that aren't as strong as others. Some dialog that doesn't ring true, meaning that it doesn't seem as if it would actually be said that way in reality, but instead is merely a way to get to a point being made.So there are a few stodgy scenes that bring the film in whole down from greatness, to being very good. That doesn't mean it isn't a good film, as it is, just a few missteps along the way.This isn't due to the emotional yet illogical behavior of the leads. Of course, logically we know that the relationship for Hal and Maddie is pretty well doomed to fail just as her mother's did, but such is the nature of people in love, even with a love based upon first impression physical attraction. So the ending of the two lovers going to meet in Tulsa on separate transports is quite telling and foreboding. That in itself nearly wipes away all of the weak scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Corny and hokey. This movie is an example of what can happen when a the storyline of a play is changed to conform to a movie format. What is a tight wrapped theatrical production morphs into something almost unrecognizable from the original on the screen. This movie can be best summed up in one word: hokey. True, the movie was made in 1955, but still, by that time Hollywood was already treating the subject of sex in a more candid manner. This movie takes a great play with a lot of intense interactions and transforms it into an overblown mess with a lot of stagy overacting. Despite the title of the play, the story is not about a picnic, yet the movie makes a picnic a central feature of the story, which diverts the audience's attention from what is going on between the principal characters, who get lost in the crowd. If any movie did not need extras, this is the one. Yet for some reason, this movie has an army of extras playing picnickers. William Holden's performance is good but not especially strong or overpowering and there is little chemistry between him and Kim Novak. Much more intense and better acted are the performances by Rosalind Russell and Arthur O'Connell, both in supportive roles. The movie should have been about them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First how old is Holden supposed to be in this movie because he acts like he's 15. It appears as if the director wanted him to act like Mickey Rooney. To this we add a series of one note characters. The mother who just wants her daughter to get married, before she turns 21? I know this is 1950's midwest America but how about a slightly enlightened mid-western 1950's mother. Then there's Novak's character, beautiful, sexy, dull. Just what's up with her? She's tired of being told she's just pretty and then falls for Holden who insists on calling her baby. The younger sister, ugly but smart. Then the masterpiece of cliché that is Rosalind Russell's school marm. She's spends the entire movie causing conflict, bragging, insulting people and makes a drunken pass at Holden. Then we have to endure the scene where she begs her boyfriend Howard to take her away. Obviously the audience is meant to sympathize with her plight but what intelligent person would? The only character i really thought had some depth was Robertson's rich son but even Inge has to give him a ridiculous and illogically overwrought scene to play. Like Teneessee Williams ,Inge has not aged well. Except for Kim Novak's timeless beauty and James Wong Howe's stunning photography this is a real stinker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, Toto, this is Kansas alright.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It certainly looks and sounds like Kansas. The streets are broad, the houses have gardens full of primroses and back yards where some wood needs chopping, the rooms are tidy and the washing hung on the line, the grain elevators are a prominent feature of the landscape, the freight trains rumble along on schedule, and everyone leads a life of quiet desperation. You can almost hear the chorus of cicadas. The mise en scene couldn't be improved upon.Flo Owens (Field) runs a boarding house that functions as the emotional center of activity. The local folks we meet, their individual quirks notwithstanding, are easy enough to grasp. The concerned and ambitious mother (Field), the rebellious younger daughter (Strasberg), the supernally beautiful girl who wants to be loved for herself and not just for her looks (Novak), the frantic and aging school teacher (Russell), her friendly beau who is a middle-aged committed bachelor (O'Connell), the young local mogul who runs the grain business and carries a torch for the supernally beautiful girl (Robertson).Into this milieu, full of potential energy, blunders the thirtyish nobody, William Holden, jumping off a freight train, looking for a job "talking about enterprises and things" from his ex college friend Robertson. Holden is handsome, tan, well built, ambitious, dumb, but not insensitive about himself or others. He's like a human tornado. There's nothing phony about him except everything.It's all played out well. The tension rises in a predictable arc. The characters are recognizable, even if you aren't from Kansas. Everybody has a touch of those small-town values.In the end, after all the conflicts, urgent importunings, and brawls, the supernally beautiful Novak gets on a bus and leaves her mother and her town to meet the tramp Holden in Tulsa, where they will be married. Will they live happily ever after, you ask? Well, just think about it. They love each other, they say, after one night when she gives him what every boy in town has been dreaming of having. But she's used to being adored by everyone she meets, while he's used to the rough and tumble of looking out for himself. They may make it together but I hope Betty Field doesn't rent out Novak's room.There are some sterling scenes in it. The Neewollah celebration -- that's how you spell Halloween backwards at small-town rites of intensification -- at which Holden and Novak, who have only subliminally been aware of each other, come together for the first time and dance to a tune that blends the theme song with "Moonglow." Neither is much of a dancer but Novak certainly glows under that harvest moon and the message is effectively conveyed.Holden dresses in raggedy old clothes when he's dressed at all, except for a pair of leather boots on which he lavishes much care. It's a nice touch. The hobo may not have much but he has his dreams -- and those glossy boots that symbolize them.It may be Holden's best performance, well outside his usual style of wised-up operator. He'd been plugged into that role since "Sunset Boulevard" and would return to it repeatedly. That moment of anguished insight after he has his shirt torn half off is pretty good. Novak sombnambulates through her role but everyone is more or less competent. Among the more outrageous performances are Rosalind Russell's. Her frenzied attempt to get someone to marry her are sometimes hilarious, sometimes very sad.And, in fact, although these issues -- love, sex, aging, the withering of beauty, the ephemeral quality that happiness has, the constricting environment of the small town -- are all sources of human anxiety, it struck me that they're a staple among many gay writers. It seems somehow more central to writers like Inge and Williams. All of which makes me glad I'm not a woman trapped in a man's body although, come to think of it, my having been imbued with traditional masculine values hasn't done me a hell of a lot of good either. I mean, I was never a football hero or a business success, and I live in a hovel. I'd be happy to be loved for my looks alone if I had any.Anyway, I hadn't seen this for many years and was surprised at how well it had held up. If nothing else, it's an impressive depiction of life and life styles in a Midwestern village in the 1950s. A little like looking into a time capsule whose contents had been assembled by a cultural anthropologist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>William Inge, I mean. His kind of story telling has pretty much gone out of style, more's the pity for it. This is one of my favorites (along with Bus Stop) - I used to say "guilty pleasure" but after reading the play and viewing the movie again, I hold my head high as an Inge admirer. Picnic taps into something universal that Inge manages to evoke from small town, middle America. The cast is a work of art all its own - a credit to the plethora of talent available in the 2 decades following WW2. William Holden had better roles, but not many, certainly The Country Girl and Network. In my opinion this is Kim Novak's finest work and Susan Strasberg displays the promise that she, alas, didn't quite fulfill - not for lack of talent or on-screen charisma. Rosalind Russell proved her versatility by taking on a part that was not much like what she had been known for. And once again I pause to consider that stalwart character actor, Arthur O'Connell and what he brought again and again to such memorable supporting roles.This is one of those films where the theme music, heard on its own, can evoke not only memories of the film itself and the story, but also of where and when one first saw it. Brought together again with the movie it is even more powerfully evocative. When I hear the theme I cannot help but think of that final aerial shot with the theme coming up and over and relive the powerful emotions that shot brings to the fore. That is from an era when scores were written for films, to bring another out another dimension of the story, rather than as a form of product placement. We are not better for that loss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Giving this movie top marks would be a blatant glossing over of problems. But it's recreation of a small town picnic, and all the stories, anxieties and events that boil over during the course of the picnic is scintillating and at times downright astonishing. Several generations of love story are happening here. Susan Strasberg as young Millie Owens caught my attention the most, a young girl who is so strikingly beautiful that the proposition of the film that she is not pretty, or at least that her sister Madge is the only one worthy of attention from the boys, gives me giggles. She memorises Shakespeare sonnets and has a Miro print above her bed. She is the kind of girl I would have done anything to meet at that age.A few years later Preminger supposedly introduced a new shock to American audiences with mentions of "pink panties" in Anatomy of A Murder, but here we have a similar quote, "What do people say if I walk down the street with little pink panties on?! What do I care what people say?!", from an ageing schoolmarm nonetheless. I think that this movie is often just as risqué, and actually sees straight through the American Dream. Occasionally silliness slips through though. It is quite ludicrous that a bottle of whisky, smuggled into the picnic, is treated here as if it were more dangerous than a hand grenade! William Holden, although clearly too old for the main role of Hal Carter does a very good job here of acting a young man who feels he is on his last shot at happiness, having wasted his college career idling and chasing girls and drifting around afterwards, owning only the shirt on his back.As someone who may also well have missed the haywain of life, reeling in an autistic daze, I find the movie heartbreaking. It's one to be seen on the big screen for full effect. Will seem a very small movie on TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Picnic' is one of those old movies that I've been familiar with for 40 years. It has been a sticker in my collection in that I turn to it now and then for some sort of indescribable fix. I can't put my finger on it but there is something about it that clings to the visual memory. But then when I do watch it after a long hiatus I wonder what I ever thought was so good about it when it possesses so many flaws and laughable dialogue.Part of the attraction, a major part, is the physical magnetism of William Holden, who was too old for this role but managed to convey a compelling animal magnetism that rivets the eye and the imagination. There are just too many lines in his forehead to convince as a 20- something drifter. And the impetuousness of the character, as written, sits uneasily with the older actor.But somehow Holden makes it work, though he wasn't the greatest actor in the world he was a great star and that's what this movie is all about. Kim Novak is a better actor than Holden and if you can get past the horrible mess technicolor makes of her rat's nest of a hair-do you can see clearly how versatile this often-maligned actress was. I watched her carefully this last viewing and was struck by how she was very much the earlier prototype of Patricia Arquette (Lost Highway). Novak also has Arquette's sweet/gritty quality that makes her headlong rush towards sensuality convincing.The script is structurally brilliant but the dialogue is often risible. 'Picnic' is indeed a sexy film, almost over the top in camp innuendo, and the dialogue plays this up. There they are, a community of aging women and sexually naive girls, then bammo, here comes a studly hunk out of a passing box car and all hell breaks lose. All the women go bonkers, overwhelmed by long-dormant hormones that are suddenly aroused by Holden's atmosphere choking testosterone level. I last watched this with a younger friend who had never seen this movie before and he was swept away by the barometric pressure of repressed sexuality and spent the rest of the movie making up his own highly pornographic dialogue, which was funny for awhile but, being young, went on for too long and ruined the best parts of the movie which come near the middle and at the end.Every character in this film is effected by Holden's sexuality, even, especially, the men. Nick Adam's young dude inspired much imaginative chatter from my young friend, especially the scene at the lake with everyone in swimming trunks. As 'Picnic' was made in the mid 1950s it is extremely coy about sex in that you don't see any, but it's going on behind the scene. There are two acts of fornication, off screen, that are lightly alluded to. When Holden moves and dances the camera cuts him off mid-crotch, rather like Elvis being edited from the waste down on the Ed Sullivan show. But Holden's attributes are abundantly obvious when he's just standing there presenting no momentary sexual threat. But the dancing scene between Holden and Novak is unadulterated eroticism and is one of the reasons this film remains in the forefront of 1950s melodrama.Having said that, there are some highly charged scenes of the underground sexual stampede in progress. Rosalind Russell plays a frustrated middle-aged school teacher who fears a lonely life in a boarding house with other old women. Her hormones go ballistic when she claps her eyes on Holden. There is a very intense scene at the night-time picnic in the park in which Russell gets drunk and throws herself at Holden, ripping his shirt in shreds at the end. Later she gets her half-gay boyfriend, Arthur O'Connell, to screw her then marry her. Potboiler stuff!The poorer technical aspects of 'Picnic' are the primitive ugly technicolor plus careless editing and continuity. The switch from medium shot dialogue to close-up reveals a lack of attention to detail, like the sudden change in hair-styles between the two shots, and so on. The backgrounds for little trips in the mustard colored Lincoln convertible are clearly filmed on a set and look fake but that was par for the course in those days. There are some stunning visuals of sunsets and wide-angle views of the Kansas prairie. It is the cinematography, in spite of the technicolor, that keeps me coming back to this movie.This film shows the 1950 Midwest ethos exactly as it really was. My young satiric friend found sinister undertones in the Neewollah (that's Halloween backwards) ritual when the Queen of the picnic comes floating down the lagoon in her swan boat. But those were innocent times, not universally rife with religious repression and social unrest, as the current press will have us believe as it tries to rewrite the history of that era. People, generally speaking, were much happier then than they are now.'Picnic' is a strange movie; a classic of homo-eroticism and simmering sexual desire and, as time passes, ever more camp, and a sui generis display of the Method school of acting. But it will hold its place in the annals of film if only as a museum piece with some sultry scenes of sexual mania unleashed in a quiet Kansas town. A staple of any complete film buff's library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Flawed Adaptation of a Much Better Play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Picnic has become known more as a highly melodramatic soap opera due to this 1955 production than it was originally known and appreciated for as a highly successful play on Broadway.Many viewers who don't like the film, blame it on the miscasting of the great William Holden who was more than a few years to old for the role. While he gives the role a great effort, he seems very self-conscious in the role. He was too old and too weathered and his innate intelligence just comes right through.But the larger flaws in the production first comes from the need to dampen down the sexual references and repression of the piece so that it might perhaps fit the film codes of the day.Daniel Taradash's screenplay, most probably inhibited by the film codes, is still stiff and has none of the internal angst of the play.Also, Joshua Logan seemed more intent on making a "big" film out of something far more intimate and intense. The play has light moments, but it is really more brooding and intense. You have s sense that these people are either sleep-walking through their lives or are about to explode from their own personal repression or shame. Only the wise Mrs. Potts in both play and film is finally at home with herself; perhaps so because now at the end of her days she just is at peace with her expectations versus her actual life. But Logan loses the subtly in favor of a big film, with big shots and sets, wonderful (but at times way to dramatic) film music. The film needed the intimacy that films like "Streetcar Named Desire" or even "A Place in the Sun" could provide. Now the latter is a good example of a big film that doesn't lose the intimate nature and intensity of the characters. This is not Logan's forte' and he too was not the best choice for the film's director. I think Kazan would have been one of the few at the time to breathe the kind of life in the film that enhanced the plays best qualities. This is a story of very real and desperate people trying to live in a rather sterile environment while not realizing how suffocating that environment is to their souls. It is Hal and Madge who are at least for the moment able to break free.It is Logan's broad interpretation of the story that not only loses the heat and intensity of the play, but makes the film itself more dated today.Supporting performances range from okay to wonderful. The wonderful being in particular Verna Felton as Mrs. Potts. Also great is Arthur O'Connell as Howard (oscar nomination for best supporting actor). Betty Field is one of the few who really creates the angst and multi-layered-inner struggle that is in the play itself. Rosalind Russell almost pushes the limit to overacting, but in the long run; it is a very affecting performance. Cliff Robertson does a capable job in a more poorly written screen role and maybe the least well written role in the play. Susan Straberg is great and outshines many in the film with her energy and sense of truth. She is spot on throughout and it almost makes those around her like Holden or Novak look more out of place or stiff. What a real film talent was lost in the lack of studios to know what to do with Ms. Strasberg.I would love to see the real heat and intensity of the play be revisited in a remake today where you could see it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first helicopter shot in an American film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first helicopter shot was done by cinematographer Paul Ivano for the opening credit sequence of Robert Siodmak's "Criss Cross" in 1948. (Franz Planner is the film's credited cinematographer.) Ivano perfected this helicopter shot, as documented by the American Society of Cinematographers. The shot is a stunning slow descent in a long take from 12,000 feet. The aerial view establishes the film's visual metaphor of criss-crossing Los Angeles streets, but also dramatizes the descent into chaos that is characteristic of film noir narratives. The shot sort of spills into the action already underway as the camera discovers the film's fatal couple (Lancaster and DeCarlo) engaged in some dangerous double dealing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suppoting Characters More Interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to argue with those that say Holden was too old for the role. Maybe Inge wrote the part for someone 37 to play it but it just doesn't wash. He's been out of college for over 15 years - get on with your life. And Holden had already been in Sunset Blvd 5 years earlier so its hard to think of him as a young vagabond.Kim Novak does the best she could with her part. Whether it was Inge or Taradash that is responsible for it, but the part seems to have the range from A to B and Novak at least stretched it to a C. She's no Katherine Hepburn but she does what she can with the part. Plus she really looks the part. But I think the grain elevators had better parts written for them than Novak.The most interesting characters and the best performances were by Susan Strasberg and Rosalind Russell. Russell chews through her scenes and practically pulls the camera to look at her. She could make you pity her one moment and hate her the next. Her not winning an Oscar is further indication that the awards rarely go to the most deserving performances.Strasberg brings the most to her role as the nerdy sister who has a vision beyond joining the local country club. It's a shame she couldn't have gotten more and better roles before she died in 1999.Inge knew how to write a good soap opera in small town America. Not everyone's cup of tea but well done for what it wants to be.</fullReview>

It's impossible not to smile when you see her dancing with William Holden, her partner at this part.Holden is good at the romantic and dramatic scenes. He's also good at the action ones, when his character is running away from the police. His diversity is also one of the best attraction of "Picnic".The plot, however is nothing but silly. We don't see anything new in the two hours the movie lasts and that's a little tiring.My Rate 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I've been fond of William Holden for years I didn't get around to seeing Picnic until 2001. Needless to say, it's regarded as one of his better acting efforts and has been applauded as one of the great romance films of the 1950's.Holden's range as an actor is apparent as he portrays one of the most annoyingly idiotic characters ever put on film. Hollywood maintains a love affair with the so-called "romantic drifter." This was especially true in the Fifties, when the Film Noir movement shattered certain stereotypes for the sake of more interesting cinematic art. In the case of Picnic, though, the social misfit treatment is laid on by the dump truck load.The character Holden portrays, "Hal Carter," is representative of the anti-hero type popularized in the plays of Eugene O'Neill: the immature, handsome-but-aging white male whose schoolboy-athlete glory has faded after years of adult failure. Although such characters can have a limited appeal, they become extremely tiresome when developed to the extent seen in Picnic.On the other side is Kim Novak's character, "Madge Owen." As the beautiful blond daughter of a poverty stricken widow, Madge is expected to marry young, handsome, wealthy "Alan Benson" (played by Cliff Robertson.) However, Madge spurns a comfortable married life and runs off after Hal, who flees a brush with the law and then goes in search of a "job as a bellhop." Madge's unintellectual persona is reinforced by the presence of a college-bound, less-attractive kid sister.Do poor women routinely spurn handsome young millionaires in order to run off with hunky-but-penniless drifters? Possibly. The real question is whether or not Picnic is a movie worth viewing. If you're a serious fan of William Holden, everything he's done is a must-see. Hard core film enthusiasts should also view Picnic at least once. As far as I'm concerned, though, once is enough...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vivid character study, more than just a "soaper"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen `Picnic' more times that I could count, most recently on the excellent DVD edition. It was released in 1955 and powerfully evokes old-fashioned small town America, but the essence of it transcends time and place. The dilemmas and stages of life portrayed can only be fully appreciated by someone who's gone through some of them. It was always one of my mother's favorite movies, but I needed to grow up to a certain extent before fully appreciating it. It's one of those films that gets better with repeated viewings, and changes even as you yourself change.A scene that immediately comes to mind is one where Rosalind Russell, as a desperately lonely middle-aged woman living in denial, is unblinkingly staring at a blazing red sunset with her gentleman friend, Howard. In a tight, intense tone of voice she suggests that the day doesn't want to end, that it's going to `put up a big scrap, try to set the world on fire,' to keep the night from creeping in. Yow! Besides being an example of great acting, it's a scene that someone in their teens or twenties simply can't fully understand or appreciate. Russell makes the most of it, and it always brings a lump to my throat. Howard, in his clueless way, agrees that `a sunset is a beautiful thing, all right.' I suspect that people who watch this film, shrug, and say `so what? Kim Novak is fat and dull, and Holden is too old' are a lot like the character Howard, which may be to their advantage after all.Regarding Kim Novak, I could certainly picture a more nuanced performance in that role, but she is better than OK, and not fat by 1950's standards! As for William Holden, who plays Hal, much can be forgiven for the sake of charisma like his. He certainly seems older than Cliff Robertson, who plays his former college fraternity brother (Holden was 37 at the time). This is addressed in another scene with Rosalind Russell (now I think of it, hers may be the best performance in the film), where her insecurity and anger are suddenly let loose in a drunken rage as she lashes out at Hal. She shouts: `you're no jive kid, just afraid to act your age,' and her tirade gets meaner with each second. This is the turning point of the whole story, and contains some more great acting. She spits the words out like venom at Hal, whose agony on hearing things he was afraid to think about, let along say out loud, is clearly visible on Holden's face. `Picnic' is full of vivid scenes like this, as well as more subtle and lighthearted character studies, and it is not a soap opera by any means.Incidentally, this film contains a technical milestone at the very end. The last shot is reputedly the very first helicopter shot in a motion picture, and was done using a US Navy chopper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mixed bag, but one of the better ones in cinematic history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I began watching this film not knowing quite what to expect, and finished it not knowing quite what to think. The first hour or so was unforgivably dull, I found myself dozing off and felt no sympathy towards any of the characters. The second half was nearly as bad, extremely melodramatic and with some spectacular overacting. Yet then there was one scene that continued to haunt me and lingered on the memory, the most famous one in the movie. Yes, it was THAT dancing scene that dazzled me, one that has been written about ever since and is certainly one of the most entrancing scenes in cinema. It is a shame it has been wasted on a film that is such a mixed bag as this one is, yet it reveals the themes of sexual tension and the pain of unrequited love that in other scenes is smothered in a thick layer of ridiculous melodrama. Watch the film for that one scene, but be prepared to sit through a hell of a lot of tedium to get to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joshua Logan 's movies have generally not worn well;he used to say "bus stop" was La Monröe's best part,probably he had not seen the Wilder masterpieces or Hathaway's "Niagara";"Sayonara" was a tear-jerker ; "paint your wagon" totally missed the point with a cast of non-singers (Eastwood,Marvin,Seberg) for a musicals."Camelot" was too much for me,and anyway was dwarfed by Boorman's "Excalibur"."Picnic" shown in a restored copy with dolby sound retains its charms.James Wong Howe's cinematography is as usual dazzling:the peak is arguably the queen of Weenollah(Halloween in reverse),Kim Novak,arriving on her boat ,with thousands of lights illuminating the scene.The contrast between the beauty of the picture and the ridiculousness of this two-bit majesty provides the story with its pivot:only after it,the characters reveal their true colors.Holden the Hobo will act as the community's enlightener.His best friend (Clint Robertson) had already pointed out that his chum is not in the same social class as them (and particularly him),but seeing his girlfriend under the spell of a good-looking no use at anything man is too much he can endure.The old maid,trying to convince herself she is still young, cannot help but insulting Holden who represents all she left behind.Rosalind Russel overplays a bit,but she paved a reliable way to Maggie Smith's performance in "the prime of miss Jean Brodie"(1969)"I wanted to make a movie about the beautiful people's solitude" Logan said.That's true for Holden whose cheerfulness hides a sad and lonely childhood,with no place to call his home.That's true for Novak,living in a woman world-the first appearance of Holden seems like something supernatural for them-,taught to just sit there and look pretty.It also marks some kind of birth for the main actress.Kim Novak has , during the whole movie ,neither the look nor the hairdo we do know .And for the last sequence,she really becomes the figure she will always be remembered for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A macho drifter (William Holden) sidles into a small town in Nowheresville, U.S.A. and the local womenfolk, who all apparently think that their menfolk aren't up to snuff, drool all over him like he's a stripper at a bachelorette party. Not much else happens in this wanna-be sultry film based on the William Inge play.The 1950s were a big decade for big movies based on big plays. Unfortunately, every film maker was under so much pressure to tone down whatever it was that made the play big in the first place, that the movies based on them seem all too often like a big to-do over mighty little. "Picnic" is nearly plot less; the only suspense comes in wondering if Kim Novak is going to ditch her dull home town and take off with her hunk of man.Holden was a good actor, but he gives a silly performance here. The script and the direction push too hard the fact that we're supposed to be overwhelmed by his virility---which is a shame, because that was one of Holden's most striking attributes when he was allowed to act more naturally. His furry chest was up there with some of the most famous chests in screen history, yet they had him shave it for this film so that he would look younger. He instead resorts to ripping off his shirt every so often like the Scottish janitor from the Simpsons.Kim Novak, on the other hand, was never really a good actress, and this movie didn't change my mind. Talk about famous chests---holy cow, she could poke eyes out with those things! The BIG moment between her and Holden comes when they dance at a town social, if dance is quite the right word. If you've seen Elaine on "Seinfeld" dance, you will have a pretty good indication of what these two look like.The best performance in the film comes from Rosalind Russell, who plays the sexually frustrated town shrew, married to the town drunk (Arthur O'Connell). She's able to convey the desperation felt by a woman slowly wasting away in a forgotten corner of the American heartland and illustrates exactly what Novak's character is afraid of becoming.I know I'm being pretty hard on this movie, but actually I did enjoy it. It's really nothing special, so don't go out of your way to see it, but it is fun to make fun of all the cornball 50s trappings.Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this with Mom who hadn't seen this before so we were both watching this with fresh eyes. William Holden plays a drifter who wanders into a small town hoping to reacquaint with college buddy Cliff Robertson who's the son of a grain company boss. Robertson has Kim Novak for a girlfriend, one who's tired of being valued for her looks as she's a shoo-in for winning the title occasion's beauty contest. Other female characters start having urges around Holden like the schoolteacher played by Rosalind Russell and the teen sister of Novak played by Susan Strasberg. Joshua Logan, who also directed the play version of this, helms this film version with quite a theatrical and cinematic flourish with a music score to match that makes it quite admirable if a bit over-the-top in some scenes. Still, the performances are very good with Ms. Russell and Ms. Strasberg particularly memorable. Also, Arthur O'Connell also was good as Ms. Russell's beau.

		<fullReview>Picnic: Never saw it when it came out. Saw Kim Novak on special TCM interview show this week, she of 80 years and still looking wonderful. I DVR'd Picnic, and of course marveled at how young she was at the time this movie was made. No white hair for Kim. Her hair is still a beautiful blonde, and her 2012 clothing in the interview was very stylish.Holden looking wonderful. So what if he was so much older. Alan was his age, and nobody asked how many years after his college graduation. Holden a bum, a loser, with juvenile delinquent record must have been somewhat attractive qualities for Novak, since all she had to compare was goofy rich guy Alan or stupid paperboy Nick Adams.Susan Strasberg couldn't fool her mother with that smoking. Betty Field made a nice mother, and I remember her as Cassandra Tower from Kings Row. Mrs. Potts was very nice, and accepted Holden as he was, not comparing him to some local hometown Romeo.Kings Row was a small town where bad things happened. So was Peyton Place. So was Harmony on TV's Passions. Remember River City, Iowa, in the Music Man? River City's 'crimes' included things such as 'reading a dime novel in the corn crib.' Indeed, small town America has lots of shouldn'ts and secrets, and absolutely everyone knows everyone else's business. We have a particular small town in our state where people left their doors unlocked only ten years ago, but now their minimal crime leads to locked doors.Picnic was where a hot hunk, invited, arrives courtesy of a freight car, into a town in the middle of nowhere and proceeds to take the most beautiful young woman away from the high-rolling scion of the town's wealthy leader. During the actual picnic itself, food and desserts are only the precursors of the steamy evening to come.The Rosalind Russell part was way overdone. She was so desperate. Arthur O'Connell was probably married to his mother, and Roz must have ended up being a very shrewish daughter-in-law, if the mother was still alive. Roz begging Arthur to marry her was so corny, uncomfortable, stupid and dumb. She should have stayed on at the school, where at least the children may have returned her affections. Sticking out her tongue as she departed the school was the most terrible thing I saw her do. It's bye-bye lowly school paycheck, and hello O'Connell's self-employed monthly stipend with probably poverty for Roz and scrubbing those floors on her hands and knees to keep in favor with him -- since apparently he had no passion for her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Top rating of the film with one major flaw. This film was originally released in anamorphic (widescreen) and 4 track stereo. All of the DVD releases use pan-scan, which in today's world is ludicrous. You can view the widescreen on Netflix watch instantly when it is available, but if you buy or rent it in it's currently available versions, you get only half of the incredible cinematography. Why would they destroy such a wonderful film? I believe that in order to experience a film of this stature, one should at least be able to see all of what Joshua Logan intended. Aspect ratios aside, this film is a remarkable experience, especially the soundtrack by George Duning. Novak is perfect for the role, and to be realistic William Holden is a bit old for the role of Hal. The subplot romance between Rosalind Russell and Arthur O'Connell just about steals the show. James Wong Howe's spectacular cinematography is the final touch to a really great Hollywood version of the Broadway play. Dated, yes, but still beautiful.</fullReview>

That's what life is about ? simply that. By the way, this scene is definitive proof that free will does not exist. Bill didn't&#xfeff; have a chance. Guys take note: When women say they want more romance in their&#xfeff; lives, this is what they mean. It's worth a shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where it's never certain that life can be a picnic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pedestrian melodrama that's saved by the great acting from William Holden, Arthur O'Connell, Rosalind Russell and newcomer (for that time) Susan Strasberg. The other major members of the cast perform well, but the core of the story revolves around those four plus the almost ineffable Kim Novak, an actress who'd been around for two/three years before appearing here. It was obvious that she was still learning how to act; however, she was perfect in the role as the girl who is too pretty.And, while Holden performed very well, when he starred in this at 37 he was hardly a young man (a much too lined face) who'd shared a college fraternity with Cliff Robertson (who was 31 or 32) who still managed to look in his mid-twenties for this movie. Holden, however, kept up the pretense and pulled it all off; more kudos to him ? he had the body for it, anyway.The short synopsis on the main page says all you want to know about the story (boy meets girl); and I won't go into a long analysis of the plot or any of the social analysis. There are other reviews here with excellent accounts for you to read. Instead, I'd like to simply highlight some scenes in this story that are, I think, classic?There are probably three, the first being the sizzling, sexy dance between Holden and Novak at the picnic. Holden, being the energetic show-off, starts to show the young Strasberg a new dance from LA. He tries to explain it, but she is inept at rhythm and moves away, allowing Holden to see Novak, across the floor, her eyes fixed on him as she begins a sensuous sashay down the stairs towards him, performing the dance moves perfectly. He is emotionally skewered; he can't take his eyes off her. They meet softly, slowly, eyes fixed on each other as they meld into an embrace, and glide about, together in their own universe. And, all with that 'Moonglow' theme pulsating in the sound track: hot stuff, pilgrim, for those days when the Hays Code still lurked in the wings.The second occurs soon after: Russell, fed up with her beau (Arthur O'Connell) and his lack of spunk and spark, grabs Holden from Novak and demands a dance: she is so emotionally and sexually frustrated ? and a little tipsy ? she loses self-control when Holden pulls away from her roughly, and tears his shirt nearly right off as she still clings to him. Shirt in tatters, exposed chest, Holden feels naked and staggers back; but, she now taunts him about his bragging, toughness and confidence. Verbally, she tears into him, stripping away his composure, and exposes him as the insecure, ignorant and inept wannabe that he is. Perhaps that was not only a cheap shot at lousy shirt manufacturing, but also another cheap slap in the face to Mr Hays. Hey, it worked for me.The final classic scene is between O'Connell and Russell, on the morning after the picnic. Russell is expecting him to come to take her away to get married. He, however, had spent most of the night ruminating about how he was going to get out of it, while also protecting (in his apartment) Holden from the law who were looking for him. So, when O'Connell arrives at Russell's place, she rushes out and immediately assumes O'Connell is there to sweep her off her feet. The scene goes wild as all the women rush about to get Russell ready while poor O'Connell stands there, mute, simply unable or unwilling to cut through the noise to stop the stampede to his personal Armageddon in marriage. O'Connell's face goes through a wonderful variety of expressions that must be seen to be appreciated, but nevertheless, he goes off to his fate. Now, I wonder if O'Connell had studied Buster Keaton's silent exploits...Those three are worth seeing, for sure. As I said, however, the rest of the story is standard fare, albeit a quality production that shows off small town America, with all its contradictions (as in any culture); and despite what I think is a clunky, clichéd script, at times. But, Logan and his crew do it well, especially the photography from James Wong Howe, leaving this viewer with a movie that I'd watch again ? well, those three scenes again, at least. Great stuff.I saw this movie back in 1956 or 1957 when it reached Australia. As I recall, I sort of liked it then, especially Novak. This was my second viewing; and I'm glad I did see it again. Give it a six out of ten.Recommended for all.February 28, 2012</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take a gander at the one-sheet poster (IMDB) that marketed the movie to 1950's middle-America. The torn clothing and bared skin tells you how Hollywood hoped to lure folks away from their new-fangled TV's. Now, of course, the movie seems pretty tame, a lot less suggestive than our daytime soaps. But in 1955, it all seemed pretty raw.The first hour has a kind of charm, about a part of the country Hollywood never had much time for. By filming in Kansas, the producers got an unusual mid-western flavor, especially with the towering wheat silos and wonderfully colorful community picnic. Though pretty much stereotypes, the characters too come across in fairly interesting and entertaining fashion. But once Russell's repressed old maid goes into histrionic overdrive, the film collapses into the kind of heavy-handed soap opera that defined too much adult movie fare of the time. Too bad.This is the film that was supposed to establish Novak as a sex star, especially with the slow mating dance to "Moonglow", a top ten hit of the day. But, to me, she looks more uncomfortable than sexy, and comes across as much more assured in the previous year's comedy, Pffft (1954), than here. But that's understandable since the studio pressure must have been great for a girl of modest talent, Columbia's Harry Cohn having sunk a bundle into promoting his "protégé". To me, young Strasberg steals the film as tomboy Millie.On the whole, these star-studded soap operas don't wear well, being pretty much creatures of their time. What passed for adult fare then looks overdone now as each star gets a few moments to shine and justify the studio's investment. These moments, however, usually come at the expense of pacing and narrative economy, as they do here.At the same time, I expect modern feminists grit teeth over the few minutes of man-crazy hullabaloo in this film. Then too, someone should have thrown a blanket over Russell before she chewed up all the scenery in Kansas? what was director Logan thinking, I wonder. Anyway, the movie remains very much a reflection of a time when bare chests and heaving bodices defined cutting edge attraction for movie audiences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm still on my mission to watch all of the older Oscar winning movies and this one did not disappoint. My favorite character and storyline was the one involving Rosalind Russell. I loved her "old maid" schoolteacher role. I thought it was great how she wrangled IL' Howard into marrying her. He never knew what hit him, but he still looked happy. William Holden did look a little old for his part, but I especially enjoyed his time at the fair. That "girl carrying" contest was really something. I didn't know you could hold someone up like that. They say this movie is a classic and I guess it is. Still, these old movies all seem a little melodramatic and over-acted to me. I'm going to continue watching them though; they are entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Issues so fundamental as Picnic to the human condition, where even the most awkward souls are found worthy of love and redemption, rarely date.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes Picnic a compelling film by viewers of every generation? Is it the romance and finding of one's true love we all so desperately long for -- the sudden unexpected discovery of mutual love poetically dramatised in that unforgettable dance? Is it sage old Mrs Potts' open-hearted generosity despite her life's disappointments, in stark counterpoint to the bitter disappointments Flo can't forgive and forget? Do we love it for Madge's courageous struggle with her head over her heart? For Millie's struggle between sisterly love and sibling rivalry? Or perhaps we love it best for easy going Howard's tolerant compassion for Rosemary's cruelty and his subsequent acceptance of her despite her deep flaws? This classic film elegantly portrays the ideal sense of community and kinship that as human beings we crave, made poignant by Hal's sordid history and sudden wish to settle in Picnic's intimate, connected world he has invaded and disturbed. Nothing will ever be the same again among all the lives Hal touches, yet (and this is the lure of Picnic) the community and kinship in the broader world remains unshakable, as sure as Labour Day. At the end separate lives converge and relationships realign, fulfilling everyman's hope for connection in this imperfect world where even the most awkward souls are embraced and found worthy of love and redemption.</fullReview>

I get transported back to my childhood in the 50s by this film: I can almost taste the watermelon and smell the summer heat. Beautiful. Well directed, and the music is fantastically pretty.Kim Novak is just a breathtaking doll. The movie's theme is ephemeral and dreamy, quite romantic. I'm a 53 year old guy and I still get goose bumps when Bill Holden grabs Ms. Novak on the pier beneath the lights and begins to dance with her. It says with music and visuals what words cannot express: the thrill, joy, and wonder of seeing someone who fascinates you .......one you will easily fall madly and hopelessly in love with. Electric. A masterpiece to be seen many times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>that William Holden</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although an enjoyable film, Picnic falls sort in the casting department. I'm somewhat of a William Holden fan - Sunset Boulevard is one of my top 5 films. Still, try as he might, I think he's just too old (I think he was 38), to play a mixed up kid in this movie. In reality, he's much closer to the age of Madge's mom than Madge. Kim Novac, in what I believe is her first screen role, is inexperienced in the acting arts, and it shows. She's marvelous in the dancing scene with Holden, but other wise stumbles about it a zombie like state. I find it quite difficult to get caught up in her situation - "people only say I'm pretty" or something like that. The subplot is something that grabbed my attention. The interplay between Rosalind Russel and Arther O'Connell always gives me a chuckle, no matter how many times I watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Columbia's Harry Cohn assigned Joshua Logan to direct the movie version of the hit Broadway play Picnic. William Holden the quintessential American Man stars and gives a typically Holden performance by that I mean outstanding. Rosalind Russell a big movie star took the supporting role of the spinster teacher and the cast is rounded out with Cliff Robertson, Arthur O Connell, Nick Adams, and Susan Strasberg and saving the best for last Kim Novak who became Madge for the picture and Novak became the #1 Movie Star in the World. One reviewer called Kim Novak 'the most beautiful woman since Helen of Troy' and I agree. Kim Novak in interviews claimed that Logan wanted her blonde hair reddish brown and also that nearby storms created a moody atmosphere on the set. Whatever the cause, the effect is memorable. Sony btw has named stages for Holden and Novak on its Culver City lot in honor of this great Picture and contributions to Columbia overall; by Novak and Holden two of Columbia's legendary superstars Kim Novak and William Holden. One cannot be anything but overwhelmed by the magical dance sequence orchestrated by direct Josh Logan and a cinema photographer genius James Wong Howe one of the sexiest sequences of all time!Bravo</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having thoughts about Picnic since it appeared in 1956. Some strange coincidences keep popping up. When Cliff Robertson announces Madge descending the stairs, he calls her Delilah. In The Man With The Golden arm with Frank Sinatra and Kim Novak, the theme music is Delilah Jones. In Veritgo with James Stewart and Kim Novak, when she returns to her original identity, she claims to be from Salina, Kansas, near where Picnic was filmed. In Man with the Golden Arm, she is instrumental in helping a junkie get it together. In Picnic she is the same with Holden in getting his life together. The same can be said of James Stewart in Vertigo. There may be other films and other coincidences. Can anyone help on this? Thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie after watching "Splendor in the Grass" and reading the play "Picnic". I would have enjoyed the movie much more with, say, Marlon Brando in the lead, or Charleton Heston. the role clearly asks for a luscious hunky Adonis. somebody who makes everybody drool with envy and lust. holden does that, but he needs a suit, then some glass and steel around him. also, just combing his hair forward is so desperate. apparently he was 35. right, and i'm the king of Spain. everyone else is pretty neat. but especially Rosalind Russell. she really steals the show. the character she portrays doesn't seem so alive in black and white. more pathetic. Rozalind Russel is a hoot ,particularly with the line, "i wanna have fun" or words to that effect. goodness. talk about desperate! just plain awesome. the photography has that "i'm an important, expensive movie of the 50's". "Giant" had that palette. a lot of high end films of the period did, i guess. the actual picnic scenes are really fun and tenderly shot. towards the end of the film the editing becomes haphazard. i just assumed somebody was fired at that point in the film and some new kid had to make sense of the mess left behind...apart from that an enjoyable film about many things including a mid century crisis of identity of a lusty, powerful and handsome young nation speculating about it's place in the worlds stage....but that's another review...</fullReview>

I know; I grew up in one. This is a superb production from top to bottom. William Holden portrays drifter Hal Carter, a man who never decided what he wanted to be when he grew up. He rides a freight train into town to visit old fraternity buddy Alan Benson, played by Cliff Robertson. The ensuing fireworks his visit sets off change the lives of many of the townspeople forever. The sexuality is more hinted at than obvious in this movie, but somehow that works better than the blatant sexuality of today's movies. First-rate performances from all. This movie is truly a classic. It seems to get better every time I see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hits the heart of Heartland youth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie tells a simple yet beautiful tale about what really matters in life. I think the actors were perfectly cast, with only William Holden being able to portray the desperation of Hal Carter, a drifter who has tasted life's wildest waters but only longs to settle down and find love. In contrast, Kim Novak plays the girl who has always settled for her small-town life and what her mother tells her to do. When these two forces combine, Kim gets to taste a wilder life while Holden's Hal finds a way to settle down without losing his zest. Growing up in Nebraska, I can relate especially with the conflicts that the characters go through, trying to find the balance between a life of success, comfort, and popularity or choosing true love. Much like Hal I went to California to become famous but returned disillusioned with life. His ability to find love and joy in the most mundane town in Kansas gives me hope. The plot is strengthened by the sub-plots, which perfectly illustrate the hopes and frustrations of small-town America. There is the sister who is not the "pretty one", but who hopes to go to New York and write sensational novels to rebel against the restrictions of her hometown. There is the controlling mother who would prefer her daughter to marry the son of the local grain tycoon. And finally there is the wooing of an old maid schoolteacher by an easy going business man, which provides a look at what Novak and Holden's relationship would be if they were old and desperate for love. All this against the backdrop of a cheerful small-town Labor Day picnic makes for a tale about what really matters in life, a perfect reflection of the American dream balanced with the dreams of the heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why this film makes such an impression, remembered somehow fondly since first seen many decades ago. On any realistic reckoning it's hopeless. Kim Novak is the most wooden film star of all time, with only two facial expressions of which she infallibly chooses the wrong one for whichever scene she's doing. Both Novak and Holden are ludicrously old for their screen parts: Holden's scene with his 'father' towards the end is supposed to be touching but comes out as music-hall comedy. The direction is irredeemably stagy with no concessions to the cine camera -- you expect heavy velvet curtains to close on the stage at any moment. The melodramatic bits lack drama, the supposedly touching romantic bits are played as farce, and the farcical bits fall as flat as a village pantomime. Susan Strasberg and Rosalind Russell steal the whole thing, both natural movie actresses, as indeed one would expect of anyone called Strasberg. Apart from them, and a couple of other minor parts, it's a serious train crash. And yet...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie as a teenager in the 1950's and remembered it fondly. Watching it again fifty years later and reading a number of reviews of both professionals and multiple viewers, it seems to me that many are missing the entire point of Inge's play and the movie. While the music score, the melodrama, and over-the-top-acting, especially by Holden, certainly make the movie look dated, there is great irony in the contrast between the carefree, fun, happy atmosphere of the Labor Day picnic and the anguished lives of a mother whose husband left her to raise two unhappy daughters, a spinster whose entire life appears to have been spent caring for her aging mother, a love-starved schoolteacher who is terrified of living her own life out as a lonely old maid, and especially Hal, the child of a broken home of an alcoholic father and an unloving mother who was abandoned by both parents in his teens and who realizes that there is no future in store for him.

		<shortDescription>See it in a REAL theatre on a REAL BIG screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do yourself a favor and see this film in a real theatre. I've seen it 4 times now, and each time have been completely overwhelmed by it. And that was all without knowing a thing about William Inge (1913-1973). I want to include a word about Inge to address the quibbles from folks who see the film as "outdated". As my old history teacher used to say: "context is everything."Born in Independence, Kansas, Inge spent much of his early career as a closeted, alcoholic, small town school teacher, before he met Tennessee Williams and was inspired by seeing his GLASS MENAGERIE to became famous as a playwright himself (COME BACK LITTLE SHEBA, PICNIC, BUS STOP and THE DARK AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS) as well as screenwriter (SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS). PICNIC was based on his recollections of living as a small boy with his mother in a boarding house with 3 female schoolteachers. In those days, unmarried, educated women had limited choices: nurse, teacher, librarian, nun. It may be difficult to imagine now but it was also then against the law to be homosexual, and if you really couldn't pass as heterosexual, you were expected to do everything in your power to come across as asexual. At age 60, living in Hollywood with his sister after his fame had faded, Inge committed suicide, at a time when gay men and lesbians were starting to be more visible in the culture. His home town continues to honor his legacy.Although none of Inge's most famous plays have what we would call gay characters, it doesn't take much to see how they are shrouded. Take another look at "old maid" Rosemary (Rosalind Russell), a deeply repressed, bitter, desperate and alcoholic schoolmarm; her closeted, alcoholic, middle aged boyfriend Howard (Arthur O'Connell), is a confirmed bachelor, but despite the pinup calendar we are shown in his apartment, he seems most delighted in his scene dancing with Hal (William Holden). But Rosemary's alcoholism and her pattern of going through unavailable man after unavailable man are interwoven. Is she really madly in love with Howard? Or is she desperate to escape her job and end her status as social pariah? Similarly, although it's a comical scene where Howard is completely railroaded into marrying Rosemary, it doesn't take a seer to figure out that once married, they are only likely to become more alcoholic and sadder, vs "saved" by their love. Alan Benson (Cliff Robertson)is the town's rich young man who claims to be madly in love with Madge (Kim Novak), but he seems more invested in her as a declaration of independence from his disapproving father. Alan also becomes most alive and fully realized in his scenes with his old college buddy Hal.Madge and Hal are physically beautiful but deeply frustrated, lonely and misunderstood people, ignited by their sexual attraction to each other. They are both seen as somewhat dimwitted. Hal has the same beefcake/torn shirt look of the Brando/Newman characters in the film versions of Tennessee Williams' A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, ORPHEUS DESCENDING and SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH. Growing up a juvenile delinquent without parental love, Hal has only been rewarded for his physique. Likewise, Madge is praised only for hers and she feels forced into marriage with Alan as a a way of redeeming her mother's years of "grass widow" hardship. Madge's father is alluded to as having problems with drinking before abandoning the family, leaving Madge's younger sister Millie (Susan Strasburg) to grow up fatherless, and in a sense motherless too, as her mother is hellbent on Madge landing Alan. (Inge's father was a traveling salesman)The only adult women not in search of a man are Mrs. Potts (Verna Felton), the kindly old lady next door who immediately welcomes Hal with food, work, kindness and an introduction to Madge, and Flo Owens (Betty Field), Madge and Millie's abandoned single mother. Mrs. Potts is a widow in her 60's, apparently childless, and sole caretaker of her elderly mother. As Flo has had to be both mother and father, Mrs. Potts offers a fount of unconditional love to both Flo and her children. In turn, there is a suggestion that Mrs. Potts may have lost her children, and living next to Flo and her two girls has been an enormous comfort to her. It's clear that when Flo's daughters have flown and Mrs. Pott's mother dies, that these two will continue living side by side, loving and supporting each other. It is easy to imagine Flo caring for Mrs. Potts as she approaches her final days. This is not the type of relationship between women that we normally see in films of the 50's, or for that matter, of any era. And it's a bonus that both women turn in such fine performances.Much has been said about William Holden being miscast - as being too old to play the part. I couldn't disagree more. If anything, his appearing older only highlights the years he's wasted, his desperation to change his life, and his frustration at not having any solid sense how to do that. It's an exquisite and moving performance. Is the film perfect? No. For one thing, it doesn't capture the original ending written by Inge (where Madge does not follow Hal). Sometimes the music is too intrusive. Othertimes (as in the famous dance sequence) it is sublime. Although I don't think Kim Novak was quite a match for Holden, others may disagree and say her "frozen" quality befits Madge having been treated as a statue all her life. Rosalind Russell has been criticized for having gone over the top. But this is William Holden's film and he will break your heart. Go!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the 1950's great movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They made many movies in this decade using the full technological advantages and big budgets that produced Ben Hur, Ten Commandments, Cleopatra etc. None of them can compare with this movie with its big stars, great supporting actors and William Inge's play turned into a movie. For most of us, who were not as good looking as Kim Novak or William Holden, there is something to take comfort in the fact that good looks and athletic ability do not always make for a successful life in maturity. As the movie ends, the failure wins the beauty queen, but is there any doubt that their lives will probably end in the same drab failure the Sally Field's character represented? Is there any doubt in the viewers mind, who will win the heart of Kim Novak. Not the son of the town's leading citizen, played by Cliff Robertson, whose only flaw might be his former hero worship of his former frat brother's popularity on and off the football field. Despite Robertson's own good looks and eligibility, he is just no match for a not too bright but beautiful Madge's heart. If people were birds, it would be good for the species, but love or lust usually conquers making correct decisions in life. I think this is what Inge was trying to tell us, it is the tragedy that most of us face growing up, making hard decisions, and having to live with them the rest of our lives.Is there any doubt that Inge's character played by Susan Strasberg, the plain but bright sister of Madge will find her way in life? Everyone seems to be attracted to the two characters most likely to be failures in life. Is Inge trying to warn us, to think with our minds, and not our hearts? Or is he trying to tell a love conquers all story. I believe it is the latter, and that is what makes the film a tragedy.The characters played by Roz Russell and Arthur Connell are a generation older than the main ones, but reflect what usually happens in life to people who are just ordinary people who become middle age and find themselves without a permanent love or partner. The only place this movie shows its age, is the 50's generation that women want to get married, and men want to avoid marriage, but want to keep a girl friend handy for dates. If some asked me to define this movie, I would say it was a tragedy with Russell and O'Connell playing the comic relief. His line " If a woman asks you to marry her, she should at least say please" is the most comic line of the film.The Direction and in particular the cinematography are tops. This is a beautiful tapestry of the 1950 small town Americana. The dance scene between Holden and Novak evokes a sexuality that no Fred Astair or Gene Kelly ever created, for all of their skills as dancers. And with all their clothes on, they were sexier than any of today's films on screen sex. As another great Director, John Ford once said, a woman's face and eyes are the sexiest part of her anatomy. Kim Novak implied what Ford's view on the subject. The music they danced to was not driven by a heavy sexual beat of today's movies. "Moonglow" provides a sweet sentimental melody for the sexiest dance in the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a picnic for viewers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would rate this film among the best I have ever seen. I was 13 when I first saw it and it made a deep impression on me. This movie and another from the same general time period "The Member of the Wedding" were the best film dramas of the 1950's, better than the screen adaptations of Tennessee Williams from the same era. IMDb reviewers have already done excellent critiques of "Picnic," especially those who truly appreciate dramatic cinema at its best. "Moonglow and Theme from Picnic" remains one of the greatest movie compositions of all times. How the two songs, the old standard "Moonglow" and Steve Allen's "Picnic Theme," came to be mixed is of interest because the two songs do not match musically at all. George Duning had the awesome task of blending the two in a jazz-like fusion and was he successful! Who can forget the scene at the picnic where the sexually oppressed denizens of the small town are dancing to the music when suddenly it seems that the drifter, Hal Carter (William Holden), and the small-town beauty queen, Madge Owens (Kim Novak), discover each other sexually. "Moonglow and Theme from Picnic" begins to play--beginning as background music and then slowly, like passion rising, taking center stage--Kim Novak gives one of the most sensuous performances in cinema history. The audience too is mesmerized until the spell is broken by the intrusion of tipsy Rosemary (Rosalind Russell) trying to break the bondage of hopelessness that engulfs her. Pay particular attention to this part and you won't regret it.There was a song of the 50's, though it came out a few years later, called "What a Difference a Day Makes." That's a fairly good summation for the heart of this film. Hal Carter (such a common name) invades the town, he doesn't really pass through it, and changes the lives of everyone including his own. How this all happens is a treasure to watch. And pay attention to the title William Inge assigns this play. What is a picnic? A day of fun, of getting away from it all, of joy, but, alas, when it's over one must return to the workaday world, even though the picnic has been more than a respite. It has been a catalyst. Small-town life changes, maybe slowly, but it does change. Picnics have something to do with that change. If you haven't seen this movie, by all means rent it and enjoy your own picnic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So that's what small towns are about....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>********Spoiler Warning*******************In the modern day small towns are seen often as spiritual waste dumps, conformist backward places where people are either stuck at or want to get the hell out of there. Celebrations and parades are seen as some fizzled out tradition that continues because no one has the heart to stop them, and the most meaningful get togethers are family barbeques.Even as long ago as 1975 Don Johnson in "A Boy and His Dog" had a sci-fi version of the proverbial fit in or else small town. It seems the only people saying good things about them are politicians around election time, when they suddenly remember their manufactured roots and try to connect with the Great Unwashed.Yet somewhere the idea of small towns as *good* places to lives must have taken a start, and Picnic typifies what it was all about. People lived there most of their lives, and get togethers were meaningful affairs that the residents put their heart into because these were their friends they were hanging around with. However, The film is very dated, the screen is filled with clunky one-liners like "I'm no good for you baby, I'm just not."Ask the film makers, however, and I think their message would have been more about exposing the real life under the daily pleasantries of the townsfolk. Maybe even back then the change was happening, as towns became bedroom communities and the suburbs became the place to live out our social games. This view of people as they really are is very tame by modern standards and something we've seen over and over; the teacher nearly crazed by loneliness, William Holden the former hero now a loser, and so on. And of course, the drama if Kim Novak will run off with Holden or not. (As if there was any question.) Susan Strasberg makes perhaps one of her first screen appearances as the sassy but likeable girl coming of age, and her performance seemed to portend great things in what sadly turned out to be a mediocre career. It probably wasn't what the film originally intended, but the backdrop of a chummy little place where family and friends alike were to be found is the most interesting and revealing part of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Well Is a Hole In the Ground</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lush adaptation of William Inge's play, Picnic came out in 1955, a top year for films, and one in which everyone seemed alienated (Rebel Without a Cause, The Blackboard Jungle, Marty, East Of Eden). Talk about the complacent Eisenhower fifties! Things were humming in those years, at least on the movie screens.Joshua Logan directed, James Wong Howe photographed and Jo Mielziner designed the sets for this one, which is top of the line all the way. Columbia was on a roll in those days, producing two Best Picture winners in a row, From Here To Eternity and On the Waterfront, plus The Caine Mutiny, in just two years. Picnic was their big one for 1955, featuring the top male star in the business, William Holden. It didn't win the Best Picture Oscar but it made a ton of money, and was highly praised by critics.Now to the movie itself. Time has not been kind to it in some ways. Or has it been? William Inge's plays, considered so important in those years, are less highly regarded today, and for an excellent if unfair reason: they are about repressed sexuality. Since we have all overcome our sexual difficulties and live in a happy world, it does seem rather silly that people were so uptight about this topic. Hell, why couldn't they just get with the program, like we do. Sheesh! Drifter Holden arrives in a small Kansas town in time for the big Labor Day picnic. He is there to hook up with college buddy Cliff Robertson to see about a job, any job, since he's basically living the life of a tramp. Along the way he meets a beautiful girl just out of high school, played by Kim Novak, whose mother wants her to marry Robertson. Kim has her doubts, not about Robertson so much as herself. She wants to be valued as more than a pretty face, and resents the way her mother is pressuring her to hitch up with rich boy Cliff. Younger sister Susan Strasberg likes to read books and smoke cigarettes. Most of the women in the neighborhood are immediately taken with the husky, handsome Holden, and some, such as school-teacher Rosalind Russell, are quite bold about it. As things develop, Holden and Novak become, in short time, an item, as she understand his (for want of a better term) anomie, and he digs her body and her empathy. There's a strong chemistry between these two as they dance to the music of George Duning's haunting Moonglow, the best-remembered scene in the film. Then Russell gets drunk and verbally abuses Holden, calling him what nearly everyone thinks he is but are to polite to say (a man-child, a deadbeat, a con-man). This is an excruciatingly painful seen to watch even today, proving once more that hell has no fury like a middle-aged schoolmarm spurned. The movie ends on a note of tentative optimism which I shall not give away. William Inge was at his best in his way as good a dramatist as Tennessee Williams. All he lacked was poetry. His dry, flat Midwestern dialogue is decent but unmemorable; but his insight into people are their problems was brilliant. Yes, he does seem a writer of his time in many respects, yet his insights are in themselves timeless. People do make messes of their lives, however orderly they may appear on the surface. Sexual undercurrents are constant, no less so in the middle-aged than in the young; and there's a good deal of transference that goes on when parents see in their children the possibilities of fulfilling their own hopes and dreams rather than separate people with their own needs. Pretty girls do tend to be treated as sex objects, and most of us could care less what they think. Money and sex are inextricably linked in our culture, as we tend to use the one to acquire the other. People often tend to let their lives slip by, as they drift into meaningless routines and reveries that have no connection with the world outside of themselves. Sex or no sex, there is a fear of intimacy, and not just of the physical kind, that haunts our materialistic culture, from which no one, drifter or banker, is wholly immune. We externalize and categorize things to make them appear safe. Sex nowadays is out in the open as a topic in a way that it wasn't back in the fifties, but for the life of me I don't think it's a happier world. There are still all those feelings and needs of a more personal nature that remain, in many of us unfulfilled and unaddressed. This is what Picnic is about. There is, by the way, at least one memorable line in this film. After Roz Russell's school-teacher has spent what seems like an eternity trying to get storekeeper Arthur O'Connell to marry her, he responds with a vague and ambiguous, "well", to which she sharply responds, "a well is a hole in the ground, Howard!".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Young drifter William Holden (as Hal Carter) hops off a train and into a sleepy Kansas town, intending to look up college chum Cliff Robertson (as Alan Benson). While charming elderly Verna Felton (as Helen Potts), Mr. Holden takes off his shirt to cool off and immediately heats up spinster schoolteacher Rosalind Russell (as Rosemary Sidney). In fact, Holden's shaved chest turns on almost every woman in town. Unfortunately, this includes his friend's fiancée, beautiful and busty Kim Novak (as Marjorie "Madge" Owens). Even her "tomboy" sister Susan Strasberg (as Millie) gets hot and bothered. With alcoholic Arthur O'Connell (as Howard Bevans) bringing the whiskey, everyone gathers for the town's "Picnic" on Labor Day. Gulp! Not only too old, but also seriously miscast, Holden has trouble essaying the lead character convincingly. He seems to respond by playing his part even younger, at times. Someone like Paul Newman, who played Holden and Mr. Robertson's roles on stage, should have been cast - but, Holden reigned at the box office. This robs the William Inge story of its seriousness, and wastes the Columbia Pictures' fine production values. Many of the other players are theatrical; in this respect, Ms. Russell's "Rosemary" stands up and gets counted. Russell won the "Best Supporting Actress" poll at "Film Daily" over likewise nominated Ms. Strasberg. They, and the "Academy Awards" group, nominated Mr. O'Connell's relatively superior supporting actor role.**** Picnic (11/55) Joshua Logan ~ William Holden, Kim Novak, Rosalind Russell, Arthur O'Connell</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>passion is a razer's edge in 1955</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few films that attempt to portray the daily struggle between status quo and passion do as effective a job as 'Picnic'. A down and out college football-hero-turned-drifter named Hal (William Holden), visits a rich college buddy, hoping to find some work. Thinking he has stumbled into the midst of an Americana fairytale, he finds out there is a dangerous and delicate line people in such a town have to walk. As much as he would like to simply lose himself in the simple life of this town, he falls in love with his buddy's girlfriend, Madge, and the passions that arise will toss everything up into chaos. At the movie's core is the idea that passion is our natural state, and the artificial structures of society are stifling and dull. We try to convince others, and ourselves, that we are happy and successful with what we have, but unless we find a way to come to honest terms with our inner passions, we are lost.In the world of Picnic, that means falling in love and marrying the one you love. There is a basic principle of hope that no matter how tough the world is, two people in love who stick together and are true to their passion will go on, if not to prosper, at least to enjoy the struggle and have something real to look back on in the end.One of the true pleasures of this film for me was to watch the picnic scenes, and see how the writer imagined people could be at their happiest. It is a festival, with elaborate games and dances, music and lots of food. Everyone seems impervious to unhappiness, until the evening comes, and people start to realize soon they will have to return to the reality of their own lives.Why should real life be any different than a picnic every day? We realize it is because there is corruption, jealousy, and folly in the world. There is the corruption of wealth, where rich people hold all the cards, control the money, the food production, the educational institutions, the police, and if we step too far out of line, we will get crushed by the system that is kept in place to protect the status quo. There is also the corruption of passion itself. If we drink, or become jealous, or have a wandering eye for sexual partners, our passion may overtake us and break our relationships apart.In the end, there seems little hope for Hal and Madge. As Hal runs toward the freight train that will take him to safety and a possibility of a new life, he pleads with Madge to come find him. He points at Madge and tells her, "You love me!" and lets her and us see what he has come to believe, that only this love can save either of them, or any of us. It is left to us to decide how far the cards are stacked against them, and how sharp that razor's edge will prove to be.Three pillars of female stability give structure to the plot of 'Picnic'. The first is the grandmotherly love of the neighbor who first takes Hal in for breakfast. She is the one character who seems to know how things ought to be. Then there is the raw energy of Madge's little sister Millie, who could be every bit as beautiful as her older sister, but is too intelligent to play the vacuous beauty queen, and doesn't know how to bring her female passion into harmony with a male dominated and stifling world. (Personally, she is my favorite character, and I think the true underdog star of the film) Finally, there is Madge's mother, who has given up on her dreams and only hopes to save her girls from the misery she has suffered. In the middle is Madge herself, bouncing around between these three women, trying to understand how she can be the center of everyone's envy and hopes, and still feel so empty herself. Her life has been spelled out for her. She will work her charms to marry into the wealthy family, and be a prosperous, if unfulfilled, society housewife.If only we humans were capable of living such a life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of what we see in 'Picnic' doesn't need too much to say. We don't want to mar it with our heavy America of today that used to have this decade that I read somewhere is called "The American Decade." To be sure, this is one thing that could not have been made in Paris or anywhere else in Europe.The famous musical themes don't even begin to show themselves until well into the picnic--about halfway through. The opening credits are accompanied by other very American sounds by George Duning, that remind us of all the other great artists of the period--Aaron Copland, Roy Harris, Martha Graham, Jerome Robbins, Leonard Bernstein, those artists that defined America artistically in the brief period allotted it to be free of corruption occasionally.That odd, acceptable suspension of reality that is always to be found in musical comedy occurs here when Madge (Kim Novak) begins to make the slapping rhythm for the "dance I learned in L.A." that Hal (William Holden) is demonstrating to Millie (Susan Strasberg), Madge's younger sister. Madge makes her way to Hal, having lost interest in what was probably 15 real minutes since she was crowned queen of the "Neewalloh Festival," the kind of thing that still sometimes is found in small midwestern towns. Then there is that dance on the deck, and the famous themes of Picnic and Moonglow open up. I believe it was martinis that Holden had to use to loosen himself up for this. It is hard to know how to be grateful enough for these martinis.Or for that famous pink dress Jean Louis made for Kim Novak to wear (it is even part of the plot; Madge's mother Flo (Betty Field)is taken aback when it is this dress that Madge all of a sudden has on for the picnic.) There is no dress in all of cinema I remember quite the way I remember this one.The musical comedy suspension would not have remained acceptable, though, and fortunately that seemingly could not have occurred anyway--the film does not tend to point out its inability to countenance failures, it just moves on effortlessly. Once they are dancing, there is already such sex of a sort that musical comedy has never been able to hold. People should own copies of this film. These are the films that make us remember when we believed in American Romanticism, which was cinematic and it didn't matter if you were small-town if you were Novak and Holden. They ought to own it, because there is no way to remember this any more if you don't have a definite document that it once existed. And you might not go out and get it.It is strange to hear someone say "I love you" and it not sound idiotic. And it's Holden that actually says it, not Novak.I can think of nowhere else that the music is more perfectly wedded to the cinema itself.Even Joan Didion wrote a piece called "John Wayne: A Love Letter." I guess I want an excuse for what wells up in me when I see this movie, those things I said can only be held by not saying them.There was this American beauty. It can't be thought anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>romantics and Novak lovers take note...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I urge people not to read reviews of Picnic as this is one of those rare cases of a film where plot summarization and acting critique will not be able to help you. If you are a romantic and, more importantly, a Kim Novak fan you will probably be swept away by the film. I happen to fit both criteria. The film is a little dated, you can tell because the movie stars actually look like great looking adults rather than teenagers. To answer some of the criticism of the main characters, they're supposed to be ORDINARY PEOPLE...with the flaws that go with it. Many young people will not understand the film because they don't really GET that these two are running off to spend the rest of their lives together...not just a couple of years. One final point...what elevates this thing over soap opera is the ending, it's pretty clear these two are not going to live "happily ever after"the road ahead of them is pretty rugged...but so what. (Also it helps to have lived something remotely similar, though it's not essential.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting piece of Americana</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is hard to watch movies like "Picnic" today. Both the story and the storytelling are clearly of a different era. To see them today for the first time is a little jarring.First because "Picnic", while a successful stage play and a story of an earlier more innocent time, seems more than just out of date. Maybe it is the combination of nostalgia, for people, places and a period of time. Combine that with characters that are "just plain folk", it just doesn't play as well as I'm sure it did in the 1950's. Perhaps that's why despite a revival of the play on Broadway several years back, it along with other Inge plays are not revived as much as others.The storytelling or film making is of another era also. Hard for me to describe but whenever I see a movie like "Picnic", "On the Waterfront", "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" or many others, they all have the same 1950's feel to them. I'm not well-versed in camera technique, but there is no mistaking that none of these films could have been made at any other time than the 1950's. Maybe it's the wave of a different type of director, like Logan and Kazan and George Stevens.A good picture, but not a great one. And William Holden, at 37, was way too old for this role.6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific look back at the 1950s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me this film is so nostalgic it is an absolute pleasure to watch. I am a child of the 50s and, as such, and being a Catholic I was not allowed to see an adult A-II or B movie. When we took the Legion of Decency (film rating board) pledge I moved my lips but did not take the pledge, so I felt I was covered and sin free back in those days. Still, I didn't see this film in 1955, as my Mom honored the pledge and there wasn't a chance that I'd ever see it, not only that but I was 12 and wouldn't have understood it anyway. I saw this recently on TCM and immediately purchased the DVD. I'm one of those guys who really likes a good love story, and this is a darned good one. Sure, it's corny in parts, especially the picnic scenes, but that was the 1950s. It was a purer, better time when morality really counted and was respected. Life was simpler and so much less complex. Families lived together, had meals together at a table, we talked with our parents, respected them, studied hard in school, went to church every Sunday, kids played outside with other kids, sometimes up to 20 or more playing games, we had Kool Aid stands, neighborhood parades, local picnics and church pot luck suppers, movies were clean, damn &amp; hell were despicable words, kids rarely swore, adults too. This wonderful film reflects that period of simplicity and that's the main reason I give it a 9. Acting, directing, art direction and costuming are topnotch as is the music score and "Moonglow." The same goes for the Douglas Sirk films and others. These reflect the 50s more than any Elvis film or "Grease" does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visual feast, well-acted, but fails to fully deliver on early promise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beautifully shot and well-acted, "Picnic" peels back some of the layers of convention that covered 1950s small-town life, and raises serious questions about sexuality, gender role, relationships and class. William Holden, looking quite buff, delivers an engaging performance that has one rooting for him to win over his new friends, and to transcend what has been his fate, that of a Biff Loman-type ne'er-do-well drifter.Kim Novak is rather wooden, and fails to convey the restlessness suggested by the script about her future with the son (Cliff Robertson) of the town's biggest businessman. But the secondary characters played by Susan Strasberg, Betty Field, and Elizabeth Wilson more than make-up for Novak's slow fade.The generous treatment of the Labor Day picnic attended by the whole town contributes nicely to the languid, but appropriate, pacing. And it affectionately pokes fun at small-town life without being cruel or dismissive.Just when the film approaches some resolution to the issues it raises, such as why Holden's animal sexual magnetism causes such chaos in what had been a safe little world, and what the glass ceiling of class really means, "Picnic" gets muddled. What follows seems more like a "Hollywood" ending, similar to the neutering the film "Peyton Place" did to Grace Metalious' novel. Why do such serious conflicts get neatly packaged in matrimony? Isn't life more complicated than that?Still, "Picnic" is worth seeing for its luscious color treatment of small-town life, and a story that at least attempts to portray honestly the complex matters of sex, marriage and work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Holden stars as Hal Carter, a drifter looking for some purpose in his life. He comes into a small town in Kansas via a boxcar, looking for his old college buddy, Alan, hoping his friend can provide him with a good job with the family business. Hal never figured that he would stir up the entire town in only one day. He meets, and is immediately smitten, with Madge Owens (Novak), who is not only the town beauty queen, but just so happens to be the trophy girlfriend of Alan. Hal manages to charm everyone at first, but at the title event, things take a turn, and soon everyone is against Hal, except for Madge. Holden was 36 at the time of filming, and he does an excellent job as an aging man still trying to hang on to his schoolboy charm, in part by telling tall tales. Novak is stunning as Madge. Throughout the entire movie, she complains that she is tired of being looked upon as just pretty, feeling that she has to compete with her younger sister, Millie (Susan Strasberg), an intelligent tomboy, even for her mother's love. That said, Kim Novak is so uniquely beautiful, that you can't help being blinded by her beauty. At one point, at the picnic, she and Alan are sitting together next to a tree, and all that he can manage to get out is "You are so beautiful". You can see that, as nice as these words are, they have become meaningless to her. She manages to convey this thought with one look. That simple scene solidifies Novak's strong performance. Rosalind Russell is wonderful as the over-the-hill school marm who becomes nasty when she's drunk. Howard Bevans is equally impressive as her apprehensive boyfriend. "Picnic" is a true classic. Watch for the dance scene between Madge and Hal. It's spectacular!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Small Town Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really loved this movie. It tells us alot about smalltown life. People seemingly stuck in the middle of nowhere with no way out. There are two important stories being told here. First is the story of Hal the drifter (William Holden) and Madge (Kim Novak), the prettiest girl in town. The second being the lonely old maid school teacher Rosemary (played to perfection by Roz Russell) and her "boyfriend" Howard (also played perfectly by Arthur O'Connell). There's alot of talk about William Holden being "too old" for this role. I think that adds to the story. We don't really know how old he is, just that he went to college with the character that is played by Cliff Robertson. Hal could have gone to college late, who knows. The fact is that Hal maybe a handsome guy with a hot bod, but he is getting old, period. He told later in the film that he isn't getting any younger and to start acting his age. He is the pretty boy and that is all he is, or so he feels. The same for Kim Novak character. She feels all she is seen as is a pretty face. A trophy. Nothing more, until Hal comes into town. She sees him as new and exciting, and having more in common with him than her present beau. They just don't want to be judged by what they have on the outside, but what they have on the inside. Roz Russell's character is a schoolteacher who isn't getting any younger and knows it. She feels that life is passing her by. Her noncommittal boyfriend Howard is happy just hanging out. When Hal comes into town, it wakes up the woman in her. One she felt had died long ago. You see she is a woman who NEEDS man to be with. She has to do something about it now or she will rot away in that small town. When she starts drinking at the picnic, she makes a play for Hal. She dances with him and then flirts. When she sees that she is making a fool of herself, she attacks him verbally in a scene that is one of the best ever filmed. This is a classic film with great performances. Now about Kim Novak, she was never seen as a real actress. So it is no surprise that she does not do so well in this film. Yes, William Holden was older than the character "seemed", but he still does a top notch job. Everyone else in the cast were perfect. Watch this and enjoy......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Picnic"'s wonderful music score is only one-third of the best this film has going for it--the other two being the great supporting performances of Arthur O'Connell and especially Rosalind Russell. Russell, often nominated, never won an Oscar. Her best chance might have been in "Picnic," but in those days, for a Star to admit she was in a supporting role was heresy, and she refused to allow herself to be promoted for Best Supporting Actress. As a result, the Oscar went to Jo Van Fleet for "East of Eden," a movie newcomer. Sadly, the same pride would also blind Helen Hayes the following year in "Anastasia." Two classic performances went unrecognized in two successive years because the actresses would not be called Supporting. (Contrast this to today, when the supporting categories are commandeered by stars seeking an easier route to an Oscar.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Baroque-Level Melodrama Portrays Lust in the Heartland With a Stellar Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though I agree this 1955 movie has moments of silly excess (just look at the DVD cover), I'm still surprised how there seems to be a backlash by contemporary critics against the film for being dated melodrama. That's exactly the reason why I find this film so entertaining, for the Baroque-level elements provide a dramatic resonance to the most mundane of settings, the Labor Day picnic in a small Kansas town during the Eisenhower era. Into this insulated cornbelt hamlet comes Hal Carter, a swaggering drifter looking to connect with his old college buddy Alan for a job. His natural, testosterone-fueled charisma attracts all the women, including Alan's girlfriend Madge Owens. Contrary to her repressed mother's nagging wishes to marry into Alan's wealthy family, Madge becomes drawn to Hal much to the disapproval of most of the town. Spinster schoolteacher Rosemary Sidney rents a room in the Owens house, but she is desperately aching for her reluctant suitor Howard Bevans to marry her. Madge's little sister Millie tires of living in her beautiful sister's shadow and solicits Hal's attention, and kindly neighbor Mrs. Potts is the only one who sees Hal as the positive life force he wants to be.The movie begs for Douglas Sirk or Elia Kazan to commandeer it with individualistic style, but direction is left in the hands of Joshua Logan, who directed the stage version on Broadway. Logan has a tendency toward focusing on the obvious in his films ("Sayonara", "South Pacific"), but he certainly captures the latent passions that drive screenwriter Daniel Taradash's florid adaptation of William Inge's play. The rural look of the film feels right, and James Wong Howe's stellar cinematography has a lot to do with that. Another contributing factor to the film's success is George Duning's familiar, Bernstein-like music score with its soaring string arrangements. The acting is uniformly strong even if the casting is less than ideal in some cases. In a role that should have ideally gone to Brando at his prime, William Holden is at least a decade too old as Hal (the actor admitted as much afterward) and a bit too haggard-looking to be the subject of such swooning. However, he conveys the empty bravado of his character with conviction.Even though she overacts during her drunken scene, Rosalind Russell is unafraid to show the deep-seeded loneliness and innate vulgarity in Rosemary. It's a masterful performance that repels at the same time. In her first leading role, a well-cast Kim Novak manages to show Madge's insecurity in a most affecting manner especially toward the end. Her mating dance with Holden to the strains of "Moonglow" under the Chinese lanterns is still one of the most sensual scenes in movies. In fact, their chemistry is key in overcoming the contrived hurdle of believing their characters would fall for each other over the course of one day. Effective in smaller roles are Arthur O'Connell as Howard (his heartbreaking scenes with Russell provide a sharp counterpoint to the blooming romance of the young lovers), Betty Field as Madge's mother Flo, a sympathetic Verna Felton as Mrs. Potts, a young Cliff Robertson as Alan, and an even younger Susan Strasberg as Millie. I have to admit the last ten minutes of the film always get to me for its overt romanticism. The 2000 DVD contains a decent print of the film and a gallery of stills from the film set to the music score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant character study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this film. In a dramatic and interesting way it explores what must be relevant in many people's lives. Through the characters of Hal (Holden), Madge (Novak), Rosemary (Russell), and Howard (O'Connell) we can relate to the fear of being destitute, misunderstood, growing old, surrendering our independence, or being alone. The famous dance scene is one that lives up to its erotic reputation. Being an avid admirer of many of the actors especially Holden (Sunset Boulevard), Novak (Veritgo), and Russell (His Girl Friday, Craig's Wife), I was especially satisfied that their collective efforts were spent on such a relevant film. Strongly recommended, 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somewhat disappointing movie-adaptation of the popular William Inge play about a handsome drifter named Hal Carter stirring up lives (and hormones) in a small Kansas town during a holiday weekend. Very professionally assembled, and yet curiously inert. William Holden is well-cast as Carter, though the character doesn't seem aware of his own manly prowess--which seems unlikely--and he spends most of his time trying to discourage the lovely ladies who long for him. This is, of course, the writer's prerogative, but it doesn't make for a stimulating sex opus. Large supporting cast includes a sultry yet artificial Kim Novak, Susan Strasberg as Kim's combative, tomboyish kid sis, and scene-stealing Rosalind Russell as an "old maid" schoolteacher. Joshua Logan directed without much soul; this picnic needs some sexual tension, yet Logan instead gives us fluttering eyelashes. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a very good film about jealousy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i really enjoyed this film. it's beautifully shot and the performances are good. the film's first half hour is is pretty slow where the film sets the mood of the town. on the surface of the town, it's a very quiet, wonder bread type of America, wholesome looking neighbors who are pleasant and conservative. there's also a part of the town where it seems like everyone feels second best to someone else. for the women, it's about youth and beauty. the main character, madge, is in the prime of her beauty and youth. she's not yet married, not tied down by anything, and seemingly has everything. her mother is dead serious about her daughter using her looks to get ahead in the world through marriage. there's the school teacher, rosemary, who is pitiful and desperate to find evidence that she is still worthy and desirable, despite her age. what madge's mother and rosemary have in common is view that all women have an expiration date, after a certain point, if one is not married or well off, there is no turning back. meanwhile, a drifter named hal comes to town and has romantic feelings for madge, who is engaged to be married to hal's wealthy, but romantically insecure, college friend. things come to a head when during the labour day picnic when hal and madge start dancing together, and everyone's insecurity and jealousy comes out and people reveal their true unhappiness. the people in the film seem to feel stuck in a rut, their lives are set and they are regretful. but unlike other films about jealous and unhappy people, these characters are not villains or wholly unlikeable. they're likable and pleasant, and they don't let their regrets and jealousy over take them, instead, their regrets become a footnote to their lives and they go on living it like they always do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Picnic" is one of those rare smalltown movies that seems to grab you and not let go. You will remember this film for many years after you have seen it. William Holden plays a drifter, down on his luck, looking for that big break in his life. He seeks out an old college pal (Cliff Robertson) who is from the country club side of town life that Holden seeks. Holden's charisma and strong personna soon make him irrestibale to all the women in the small Kansas town that the movie takes place in. In the course of one day (labor day) he steals the hearts of several women - including the girlfriend of his future employer's son (Robertson). The movie is a grand composite of smalltown America and their hopes and dreams. Kim Novak, very alluring for the role, appears a bit stiff, but nonetheless too beautiful for Holden to resist. Rosalind Russell, the old-maid schoolteacher,nearly steals the film from it's principals, Holden and Novak, in possibly her finest film role ever. Betty Field, as the mother of Novak and Susan Strasberg is perfectly cast as the eternal hope flame for her daughtersto get out of a nowhere small town. Arthur O'Connell compliments Russell perfectly as her dowagging boyfriend. Holden, though appearing a tad too old for the part, comes through smoothly in his role and his dance scene with Novak to the theme song "Picnic" is film history. The entire music score, by George Durning is a masterpiece. The scenes at the picnic are actual and don't miss the barbershop quartet singing and the dog in and out of the picnic basket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I was alive and already an active moviegoer in 1955 when this movie was released, I somehow missed it and didn't get around to seeing it, on cable, until 2000. I was right the first time. It's hard to believe that this soaper was taken seriously and even received an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture.What's wrong with this film? Let's start with the casting. Why was William Holden so often cast in parts for which he was 10 to 15 years too old? This film is a perfect example of this miscasting. And the porcine Kim Novak, double chin and all, cast as the town's beauty? Give me a break! And the film's ending does not even approach credibility.Yet, the film has some merits. The supporting players, Arthur O'Connell and Rosalind Russell in particular, are excellent, as are some of those in smaller parts. And the film does provide a good sense of 1950s small town sexual repression and conformity. But in toto, the flaws greatly outweigh the virtues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can probably guess from the above statement that I wasn't exactly bowled over by this film. It has quite the reputation and is one of only a few films by Joshua Logan (and about all of them became famous and well-respected). It stars William Holden and Kim Novak. Holden is the handsome stranger that wanders into a small town and Novak is his love interest. Technically, it is very well-made with decent acting and direction. The problem is, for me, the story itself just didn't seem all that interesting or magical. However, considering its reputation, it is quite possible I am wrong--it might be great. All I know is, I was left pretty cold. Drop me a line some time--I'm really curious exactly what makes this a standout film. Most of my reviews are much longer than this one--mostly because I feel I have a lot more to say. This one, however, stumped me as it just left me like eating an entire meal of bread and water. It was filling but not particularly interesting.</fullReview>

William Holden is outstanding as the not-too-bright but very masculine he-man whose effect on the microcosm of a female society is devastating. Excellent jobs by Betty Field, Susan Strasberg, Arthur O'Connell, and (especially) Rosalind Russell, and the only good acting job every turned in by Kim Novak. The film is very evocative of small-town America in the 1950s, but it plays just as well today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful film based on the William Inge play.You really want to attend a Labor Day picnic in Kansas or anywhere for that matter after viewing this 1955 Oscar nominated film for best picture.Although Moonglow is played beautifully throughout the film, nowadays, you could sing along to Taking a Chance on Love. That's essentially what the film is about.William Holden's sudden appearance in a small Kansas town has definite ramifications for its residents.Poor and often abandoned by society, Holden etched an unforgettable character. However, the real acting kudos goes to Rosalind Russell for her excellent performance as the spinster high school teacher, desperately looking for love and an end to loneliness. Arthur O'Connell is just perfect to fit the bill for her.Susan Strasberg steals every scene that she is in as the daughter who grew up without a father. Bette Field is wonderful as her abandoned mother. Field made a habit of playing such parts as we saw in "Peyton Place" in 1957.With all this, it is amazing that the complete lackluster performance of Kim Novak was allowed to stand. The actress showed no emotion here. Her inactions came out as flat as a board. Two years later, she was in top form in "The Eddie Duchin Story" as well as "Jeanne Eagels"Russell, again shows what acting is all about. From the way she hides her drinking in the car to her outburst at Holden in a drunken rage, she was the true heroine in the story. Furthermore, how many of us would love to stick out our tongue to our principals and to school systems in general? Nice that O'Connell, though losing, was nominated for best supporting actor. Where was Russell's nomination in the supporting category for her excellent performance?A wonderful interpretation of mid-western existence. Note the young Cliff Robertson who does nicely as Holden's wealthy friend, who turns on him in a rich vs. poor nasty attitude.</fullReview>

It begins with a great rendition of" "Moonglow" and then Holden begins to clap to the music as some kind of mating call that Kim responds to. When she descends the stairs, clapping to the music, and starts her jitterbug... whew. Then the wonderful, shmaltzy theme from the movie takes over "Moonglow" as they continue the dance. Along with Burt and Deborah rolling around the sand in "From Here to Eternity", this has to be one the sexiest scenes of the 50's. Agree?</fullReview>

It was the feeling that the movie gave me of my past that interested me. I also know that older man, younger girl relationship and that feeling of passion that the movie depicted. Recently I went to Halstead, Kansas and stood on the bridge and imagined what that was like and then travel to Nickerson, Kansas to see the house where the home scenes were shot. A lot of things have changed around the area but the basketball goal is still up and the porch is still the same. I just can't get over that movie.</fullReview>

I hear the song "Moonglow" many times on the radio and each time I hear it all I can think about is seeing Hal and Madge dancing on the dock under those Chinese Lights. Holden always brought a certain type of energy to the screen and while this movie is a bit like a soap opera , Holden is the one who puts a charge into it, like many other classic movies he made including Stalag 17, Executive Suite and later on, in Network.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Arriving at his old home town, where he hasn't been in years, in Kansas on a freight train drifter Hal Carter, William Holden, ends up in the middle of the Labor Day Neewollah, backwards for Halloween, picnic thats to crown the prettiest girl in town as the Neeollah Queen. As it turns out the girl who's a shoo-in to win the award Madge Owens, Kim Novak, is the future bride, or so he hopes, of Hal's good friend from high school and collage Alan Benson, Cliff Robertson.In no time at all Hal, as hard as he tries not to, falls for the beautiful Madge Owens to the outrage of her mom Mrs Flo Owens, Betty Fields, who feels that Hal's not good enough for her daughter as well as his best friend, who isn't going to be his friend for too long, Alan Benson. Before all that happened Hal got very friendly with Madge's ugly duckling kid sister Millie, Susan Strasberg, who in getting a full collage scholarship at the tender age of 16 is the brains of the Owen family.It's later that evening at the Neewollah Labor Day dance where Madge, to no one's surprise, was crowned Queen that sparks really started flying and it didn't have anything to do with the fireworks display. Local businessman Howard Bevans, Arthur O'Connell, not only got himself drunk but his date spinster school teacher Rosemary Sidney, Rosalind Russell, who up until then never touched the stuff, booze, in her entire life. That's when Howard gave her a snort from his well concealed whiskey bottle which she in fact ended up emptying, by guzzling it all down, before the evening was over.Accused of sneaking the whiskey into the tea toting and family oriented Neewollah Picnic Hal is unceremoniously kicked out of it when Rosemary accuses him of getting her drunk which in fact he didn't! It was her date Howard who got Rosemary drunk as a skunk in him trying to to liven her up a bit! Not only that Howard by getting her smashed had Rosemary drop all her inhibitions about the opposite sex in that she madly and drunkenly went after Howard for the by now terribly confused man to become her lawfully wedded husband by the time the sun comes up the next morning! ***SPOILERS*** In the middle of all this insanity Hal now a marked man, in him being accused of being the town bootlegger, is on the run in his trying to escape before he's tared and feathered by the outraged townspeople who feel that he's a bad influence on youth of the community. It was earlier during a moonlight dance with her that Hal got so hooked on Madge that for the first time in the movie he doesn't quite know just where to turn and takes off with her in Madge's boyfriend's, Alan Benson, car. Later after avoiding arrest for car theft Hal gets Madge to see things his way but it's her mom who tries to stop Madge from eloping with Hal to Tulsa where he has lined up a job as a bell-hop at a local flea bag hotel. Meanwhile back in town a very reluctant Howard is forced to marry Rosemary in him knowing in getting her drunk he's responsible for her actions and now has to pay for them big time.The film ends with Hal jumping a freight train to Tulsa and Madge, after thinking things over, leaving home and taking the next bus also to Tulas to meet Hal there and live happily ever after with him as man and wife.P.S What the film "Picnic" show us is that things are far more interesting in small town America then in any of its big and major cities that we can think of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loves Labor Found</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Inge emerged as a leading dramatist at a time when it was still possible to offer Producers plays with more than five characters and one set; Between 1950 and 1957 he had four Broadway smashes all of which successfully transferred to the screen, Come Back, Little Sheba, Picnic, Bus Stop and The Dark At The Top Of The Stairs. At the age of 60, fearing he was 'written out' he committed suicide. Picnic revolves around our old friend the catalyst who arrives in the midst of a more or less harmonious group and sets the cat amongst the pigeons. In this case it is a 35 year old drifter, Hal Carter, who stirs things up; having been at college with Alan Benson son of the local Mr Gotrocks, Carter is hoping for a job and is indeed offered one, albeit little more than laboring, but that changes when Hal falls for Benson's girl, Madge who reciprocates. If that is the meat of the story it is hung on some very tasty bones from the warm, humane Mrs Potts (Verna Felton) to the Junior Miss-fit younger sister of Madge (Susan Strasberg) to the single mother of both girls (Betty Field) to the bemused 'suitor' of the spinster schoolteacher to the teacher herself, an outstanding performance from Rosalind Russell. William Holden is right on the money as Hal whilst Kim Novak adorns yet another 50s movie doing little more than look gorgeously vacuous, leaving Cliff Robertson to get what he can out of Alan Benson, a part played on Broadway by Paul Newman. Morris Stoloff's score, especially his arrangement of Moonglow, has become a classic and Josh Logan, who directed the play on Broadway, brings some excellent cinematic touches to bear. A fine time capsule.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Small Town US Allegory; Beautful and Meaningful; Great Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In almost every film-goer's mind, "Picnic", adapted to the screen from a play by William Inge, is a very "United States" play. its locale is the U.S.'s heartland, its denizens inhabit a small urban town whose main industry is growing grain. in other words, if the United States has become a public-interest empire ruled from Washington, it is a granary of the empire--and what we should expect to find is a huge conflict between individual desires, plans, hopes and evaluated abilities and a frustrating welter of bureaucratic or imposed "laws", expectations, sanctions, sanctimonious ideas and penalties for being different. What we find in the film thanks to penetrating observer Inge, I suggest, is exactly that. The central character of the piece, Hal, was a football hero who dropped out of school and has been doing job everywhere. His old pal is the scion of the owner of grain silos, holding power to give him a job or not. Hal returns to the town where his old friend lives, and gets work for Mrs. Potts, the only kind person in town who admires his ability, his positive spirit. his self-confidence. Next door live three of the other principals, Mrs. Owens and her daughters, Madge and Millie. Madge is stigmatized by and pursued for physical attractiveness; her sister avoids being a woman and buries herself in books, to learn and be different from her boy-chasing age mates. And then there is the local school teacher, representing the intellect in town, who desperately wants to leave her betrayed profession with its conformist doctrines and get "a man'; in this case Miss Rosemary Sidney is after solid business owner Howard Bevans, her longtime sex partner who instinctively opposes belonging to an order on whose fringe he exists unnoticed, unconnected. All their problems are brought to a crisis at the local Halloween "Neewollah" celebration, a mystical rite that looks like a cross between July 4th and a primitive tribal contest of concrete abilities among the locals to get noticed. The catalyst for change is a number which Hal dances with Madge; this angers his friend, who makes sure he cannot get a job, sets Miss Sidney off into attacking him with puritan accusations when she wants exactly what he does; as a result, Miss Sidney bullies Howard into marriage, the bookish sister urges Madge to go to Hal, and the two leave town to meet in a city somewhere and try to be real together in a nation of post-modernists, deniers of reality, except for Mrs. Potts. This is an extraordinarily beautiful and real physical film, well-acted and photographed exquisitely by James Wong Howe. praise needs also to go to set designer Robert Priestly, screenwriter Daniel Taradash, director Joshua Logan, art director William Flanney and Helen Hunt for her hairstyles. the film glows like an amber jewel from start to finish. In the cast, everyone is outstanding, especially Verna Felton as Mrs. Potts, William Holden as Hal and Betty Field as Madge. This was Arthur O'Connell's first sizable part as Howard Bevans and he made the most of it. Other including Kim Novak, Cliff Robertson, Susan Strasberg, Rosalind Russell,, Reta Shaw, Raymond Bailey, Elizabeth Wilson and Nick Adams are all very good. The film is stunningly beautiful, brilliantly paced and never a play. Jo Mielziner's New York production design was given space, separate house, outdoors, everything it needed to become what it did--a haunting and memorable allegory of what happens to people trapped in a nation whose leaders have taken it down the road to collectivism, and their individuality is endangered. these people fight back; and we love them for that. The "Picnic"--an outing, a chance to get away from conventions and be oneself here becomes a touchstone of exactly that, but only for the brave, those who wish to see reality for themselves and act upon it. A classic of its sort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest motion pictures focusing on small-town life ever made. William Holden (in a role he considered himself to be too old for at 37 but in reality he is perfect for it) is Hal Carter, the sexy, but penniless drifter who makes his way via hitching a train to Kansas over Labor Day weekend and deeply affects the lives of five women (Kim Novak, Susan Strasberg, Rosalind Russell, Betty Field and Verna Fetlon). While taking a humbling, but somewhat profitable odd job of raking up Ms. Felton's back yard and burning her trash the sweltering September heat gets to him and he takes off his shirt to reveal a flawless, muscular chest and awakens the dormant libido of Madge Owens (Novak) despite two obstacles: she is currently dating Hal's old college pal, Allen Benson (Cliff Robertson, in one of his first roles) who Hal had come to visit and the second is Madge's mother, Flo Owens (Field) who does not approve in the slightest of Hal's rootless existence. Rosalind Russell in one of her most memorable roles is the schoolteacher Miss Rosemary Sidney, an middle-aged spinster who is at first, secretly, and by the end of the film, openly pining for the hand of a boyfriend from her youth, Howard Bevans (Arthur O'Connell-in an Oscar-nominated role). Susan Strasberg is Millie Owens, Madge's younger sister with a brain to match the smartest guy in the entire country but wishes she could be as pretty as Madge as well as being smart. Verna Felton (in a typical, yet lovable role echoing her voice talents as the Fairy Godmother in Disney's "Cinderella" and later as Flora, one of the three good fairies in Disney's "Sleeping Beauty") is the Owens' next door neighbor Helen Potts, a kind, adopted grandmother to Madge and Millie who has known them for years. The story is full of romance (esp. the dance scene between Holden and Novak dancing to the old classic "Moonglow"), some action, and a beautiful ending. It should have won it's Best Picture nomination back in 1955 but unfortunately "Marty" had come out that same year and stole it away. Anyway, "Picnic" is a blue ribbon hit with that happy, slice-of-life aura that future generations will enjoy just as much as today's.</fullReview>

In the course of one day (labor day) he steals the hearts of several women - including the girlfriend of his future employer's son (Robertson). The movie is a grand composite of smalltown America and their hopes and dreams. Kim Novak, very alluring for the role, appears a bit stiff, but nonetheless too beautiful for Holden to resist. Rosalind Russell, the old-maid schoolteacher,nearly steals the film from it's principals, Holden and Novak, in possibly her finest film role ever. Betty Field, as the mother of Novak and Susan Strasberg is perfectly cast as the eternal hope flame for her daughtersto get out of a nowhere small town. Arthur O'Connell compliments Russell perfectly as her dowagging boyfriend. Holden, though appearing a tad too old for the part, comes through smoothly in his role and his dance scene with Novak to the theme song "Picnic" is film history. The entire music score, by George Durning is a masterpiece. The scenes at the picnic are actual and don't miss the barbershop quartet singing and the dog in and out of the picnic basket.</fullReview>
