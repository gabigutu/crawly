		<shortDescription>Not as bad as the reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I took my 12 year old grandson to see it and he was rolling on the floor for most of the film. I was surprised that it was actually funny,much more surprise than I was prepared for. This is a funny movie for those preteens and early teens as they seem to really enjoy it. Sure it is not full of high tech special effects and should never be compared to the Matrix, but it is a Disney! movie --- get it... a Disney movie. Take that into consideration ... how many Disney movies achieve high ratings anyway, other than the classics? This is a fun movie. I saw the original and it was funny too. Remember way back when everything was black and white and not color? The special effects in this movie are not very high tech and some of the metamorphosis takes place when you do not see it, so do not expect "the wolf-man" changes to be shown, nope, one shot he is a man, the next he is a dog. Some of the other critters are pretty funny too and kids seem to love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nowhere near as bad as claimed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So it's a dumb movie with a dumb plot - what do you expect? Agatha Christie? Robert Ludlum? This is a Disney film for children!As a kids' movie, it's a lot of fun with plenty of slapstick and lots of laughs. The plot is goofy, but the basic premise is hardly meant to be realistic. This is not cinema verité. People give "What Women Want" with Mel Gibson a much higher rating, but that's just as daft.There are plenty of set-piece chases, as you would expect with a storyline about dogs. If you want clever, go see the Usual Suspects, just don't take your under-eights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a funny movie. Don't "compare" it to the older one, it just isn't the same, it's made for the youth of today. Not sure what some expected, but those rating this a "1" obviously don't get out to see many movies, or are looking for something that just isn't this movie. It's funny, not Awful as a rating of 1 would suggest. Now, as far as Disney or the like goes, it's an average movie, below that which Tim Allen is capable of, this is more what I might expect to see on Sunday night TV, not on a big screen. Unfortunately as the Disney Corporation becomes more and more "corporate" and moves further from it's founding principles, its products are slowly failing to impress and differentiate themselves from the hordes of the plain and ordinary and unimaginative.Wow, blah blah, just an average new age Disney movie, not awful but certainly not anything to write home about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>better than i thought. entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went today to see this film. another remake but admittedly haven't seen the original. And I personally thought it was OK. Had three kids with me...14 yr old 8 yr old and 6yr old who all sat watching it, enjoying it and laughing away. Me too. Tim Allen was great as usual and def suits the comedy side of acting. Bit samey with the oldest child a teenage daughter who wears different clothes and wants to be rebellious...father works a lot and isn't the most committed father..mother who seems to do it all and has had enough and then the younger son who just seems to want to do his own thing but hasn't the nerve to say it. BUT apart from that the dog was great, Tim Allen and Robery Downey Jnr were great(nice to see Downey in something), some funny scenes with the actors and with the animals. Bit slow to start with but gets better. Def entertaining for kids and adults..if only Disney done more like this, seem to have dome some fantastic films years ago and then lost the plot a bit. Worth seeing</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shaggy Dog actually was not as bad of a movie as I had supposed it would be. It was mildly entertaining, it keeps your attention. It is not very realistic, for example when Tim Allen's character is chasing the cat and rams the old lady and she goes flying and hits a tree. The scenes after becoming the "shaggy dog" when he turns back to human, it is all very funny through out there until the end of the movie. Tim Allen's performance is quite original in this one, it also was better than I hoped.The first twenty minutes of the movie are very slow and boring, the movie rises up after he gets bitten and turns into the dog. Overall it was not such a terrible movie. It is a great movie to watch with your kids or family and friends. Go and enjoy the Shaggy Dog Overall 6 1/2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lackluster Family Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Assistant D.A. David Douglas (Allen) finds himself barking up the wrong tree, after he's bitten by a dog being experimented on in a laboratory and suddenly finds himself acting and the turning into a dog himself.Tim Allen's film career is a case of hit or miss. The Santa Clause movies are offset by Joe Somebody and Christmas with the Kranks. Unfortunately, The Shaggy Dog is in the latter group. To be blunt, the film is pretty bad. The movie was not funny and it was quite dull. I know it's just a harmless family film but did it have to be so boring and humorless? Of course it didn't. I always thought family movies were supposed to entertain the entire family not just one age group of the family. The Shaggy Dog may prove to be an enjoyable treat for the kids but most people over the age of 13 will probably hate it.The acting is only okay and the decent cast keeps the film from completely sinking. Tim Allen gives a decent performance as Dave but he really needs to stop doing lame family movies. Kristin Davis also gives a decent performance and she is also way above this material. I really don't like Spencer Breslin. He just annoys me and his acting isn't very good. The Shaggy Dog did not change my opinion about him. Zena Grey just gives a bland performance, nothing special from her. Robert Downey Jr. gives a decent performance as the bad guy. Danny Glover is wasted in his role and he barely appears on screen.The first twenty minutes or so are actually pretty enjoyable. After that, the movie starts reusing the same jokes and it becomes more serious. There was probably a break from the laughter for about 30 minutes since the movie was handling serious issues in a lighthearted way. I think the director did this to attract both adults and children but he ended up alienating both of them. The stupid humor will probably bore adults and the serious scenes will probably bore the children. I have never seen the original Shaggy Dog movies and maybe that's how those films were handled as well. However, the film seemed a little misdirected to me which isn't surprising since there are five(!) credited screenwriters. Behind the camera, it seems like things were a little messy and it shows in the movie. In the end, The Shaggy Dog is a harmless yet humorless family film that should appeal to the kids. Everyone else should skip the movie. Rating 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only entertaining if you're under five</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shaggy Dog is a movie well suited for a younger audience, but is a groaner for anyone over fifteen. There are a few good jokes in there that would would spark a chuckle from the 'elders', and some of Tim Allen's dog-ish impressions might make you laugh but it will get old.The movie starts off like a mysterious Jackie Chan movie, set in Tibet. We are shown a temple where a sheep dog sits praying with the rest of the monks, but a foul plot is afoot: the military has been sent to kidnap this dog, which has been alive for more than 300 years. The evil Dr. Kozak (Robert Downey Jr.) wants to market a "fountain of youth" from the dogs DNA.Meanwhile, Dave Douglas (Tim Allen), a Washington D.A., is having an average American lifestyle. His kids know that he doesn't get them, and his wife is starting to realize that she is losing her husband to his job. When the 300 year old shaggy dog escapes the test lab and bites Douglas,he transforms into a dog at night, and has many dog-like tendencies throughout the day.Often, jokes are repeated throughout the movie, yet don't receive a "running-joke" label, but become annoying. However, Tim Allen's thoughts while a dog ("I don't know why I never tried this running on four legs thing before!") are quite cute. All in all, it's like "Good Boy" with a slightly different story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I took my daughter to see this movie, and we both enjoyed it very much. We can't wait until it comes out on DVD to add to our personal collection. I really was happy with the fact that there wasn't any profanity throughout the entire movie. It reminded me of the good old days when rated PG movies could be watched by the entire family. We laughed throughout the entire movie, and it managed to hold my 8 year old daughter's attention, which is commendable within itself. So, I really wanted to say Thank You to all of the individuals who were apart of the decision making process of making sure that this movie was completely decent for our children to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Allen may be the most underrated and generous comic actor working today, willing to pursue any honest laugh to please his audience. But he's clever about it, and the slapstick in this remake rivals the pioneering skill of silent film comedians. This is Allen's best work since "Galaxy Quest."The ultimate test of this movie is the child you take along (including the one we carry in our heart). My daughter laughed and had a great time. She even explained the DNA cloning technology in such a way that demonstrated just how much craft when into the screenplay -- "make it understandable to a kid under 12" -- even though the pseudo science of the plot often distracted my adult mind.I never saw the original flick with Fred MacMurray. But I did see Lon Chaney play The Wolfman, and a dozen other werewolf movies. This is a G-rated version of the same mythology, and it resonates for me as an adult, but flies over the head of my youngster. "The Shaggy Dog" works on two distinct levels while satisfying both audiences -- I only wish all family movies were this good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked Home Improvement, Galaxy Quest and the first Santa Clause, but most of Tim Allen's other movies have been pretty bad. The original Shaggy Dog was only mildly amusing, but it was a masterpiece compared to the remake, which like most remakes, is just lazy garbage. Movies have become Big Macs, rapidly prepared junk food for an increasingly lazy audience. While Allen's Shaggy Dog is certainly better than Santa Clause 2 or Zoom, it's still mind-numbingly dull, even for the child audience it was obviously made for. I understand they're making a Santa Clause 3. Somebody should tell Tim Allen to retire before he embarrasses himself further.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally I would never see this kind of films since the title and presentation almost tells completely how bad this movie its going to be. I was almost forced to watch this movie since it was the only option in the airplane I took 4 weeks ago. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in my hole life, not funny at all. I love watching movies and I enjoy a lot of different genders including kid movies and family movies. The story on this one is ridiculous and the acting is horrible. Maybe kids under 5 years old may enjoy it, anyway I doubt it. Don't waste your time watching this movie and moreover do not waste your money renting it. This movie is awful. If possible I would of given this movie a 0 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Remake Of The Original Disney Comic Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shaggy Dog (2006) starring Tim Allen, Kristin Davis, Zena Grey, Spencer Breslin, Robert Downey Jr., Danny Glover, Jane Curtin, Joshua Leonard, Shawn Pyfrom, Bess Wohl, Jarrad Paul, Directed by Brian Robbins Maybe some people aren't aware that this is actually a re-make to the 1976 "The Shaggy D.A." with a similar premise- a lawyer running for District Attorney is contesting the title with a rival lawyer. He gets a hold of a magic "Borgia ring" and switches from being a sheep-dog to a man. This remake is the same except they took out the magic ring part and replaced it with a thousand-year-old "magic" Buddhist dog who bites the lawyer. Tim Allen as Dave Douglas is doing his usual comedic performing style and does a fine job at it. He's a dead-beat dad who learns to love his kids and become a better father by listening to his children as a dog. Kristin Davis is his wife Rebecca. Better known for her role in Sex In The City, she's proving to be a versatile actress. Zena Grey and Spencer Breslin play the kids and they're good in this also. Robert Downey Jr as the scheming rival lawyer is also comedic and fun to watch. The film is good, except it is ultimately a repetitive, predictable Disney film. It is fun for the whole family however.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can you say "Product Placement"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I for one am getting tired of the cinematography of a movie being obscured by ads directed at kids. A few years ago it was much more subtle then it is now. It is a shame to see a actor with the caliber of Robert Downey Jr. in a "b" rated movie and likely even a "C" rated movie.. I guess after prison, one has to start right from the mail room. But for him he is sweeping the floor of the mail room. The story line is tired. Normally my kids are gluttons for this type of entertainment. but they walked away from it within 15 minutes.. I however endured.. what a waste of 90 minutes.. If your kids point to this movie at the video store and say.." How about this one? " . You can tell them with confidence.. "I'm sorry honey .. I heard that one sucks"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderfully traditional Disney remake of the Shaggy D.A. Great acting and cinematography as well as perfectly timed dialog. This is what we've come to expect from Disney, good clean family fun. Tim Allen plays his familiar role as the preoccupied but hilarious comedian, an Assistant DA (ADA) prosecuting a case against an animal rights activist who was caught damaging a research lab. The lab is performing illegal experiments of which the ADA becomes a part. I didn't notice any slow spots, it was nonstop action and humor as Allen deals with his job, marriage, and family while trying to understand and cope with his hairy predicaments. The special effects were minimal as well as goofy and fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an awesome remake! In my opinion, it's funnier and better than the original. Tim Allen does an awesome job at being a dog. It kind of reminds me of Freaky Friday. When a 300-year-old dog bites a deputy district attorney named Dave Douglas, Dave is turned into a dog. His family thinks he's busy with work. When he turns into a dog, he finally sees what their lives are like when his kids are at school, or thinking about getting a tattoo. When he turns back human, his wife doesn't believe his story, and tries to prove that Dr. Kozak is testing on animals. If you love comedy, Tim Allen, and dogs, you'll love THE SHAGGY DOG!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not brilliant, but very funny, The Shaggy Dog shall keep you entertained!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It isn't going to win any Oscars, but that is not what this film was made for. It was made to satisfy the nippers and the dog-loving medium - and it does that with massive success. This film is hilarious in parts - especially the court scenes, and the chase between Tim Allen and the cat was brilliantly done, and perhaps the best scene in the film. I don't see how this film did so bad - but it is good to see that this has come out of the bottom 100 - that is for films with no heart. The Shaggy Dog does have heart, as well as character, hilarity, relatively good CGI and a sharp script. Adults will love it too, if they are kids at heart. The Shaggy Dog is massively predictable and has no particularly memorable one-liners or emotional scenes, but it is fun, and did relatively well at the box office. After all, it is made for kids, and I don't see why any kid wouldn't enjoy it.The Shaggy Dog is no masterpiece, but it is hugely funny, and is never dull or pointless. A kid's film to be reckoned with! 8/10</fullReview>

I laughed through the entire thing. I think it was a good film for only like a 3.4 rating. I liked it. If you have kids then by all means rent it! but if you're looking for a complicated plot go watch Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot. It's funny and has the right combination of wit and family.

		<fullReview>I went to this movie under protest with my 8 year old son! Okay, I had an attitude! The movie trailers looked stupid. The original wasn't all that hot. So I braced myself to suffer through yet another LAME kid's movie, like Shark's Tale, out of love for my child! Bought the popcorn, Coke and candy and settled back to enjoy HIS enjoyment, and BOY was I surprised!!! Not only was this movie shot in the traditional Disney style of "bright and airy", but it was ACTUALLY funny and entertaining! I found myself laughing out loud, which I rarely do at movies, comedy routines or jokes. Just ask my family! I'm too critical whether it makes sense or not, to see the humor. But this movie made me lose myself in it's genuine innocence and light-hearted feel. I was a kid again, just enjoying the ride! My son and I had a blast! And isn't that what you want in a family movie? To bring your family together in a mutually satisfying fantastical experience? The last time I enjoyed myself this much at a family movie was when I saw Pirates of the Caribbean. My criteria for if the movie was successful at it's job, which was entertainment, is how I feel when it's ending. Am I relieved, ambivalent or disappointed? I was disappointed when this was over! I wanted more! Tim Allen was GREAT, by the way! He, as well as the rest of the cast, with the exception of Downey, played their parts with just the right amount of comedic enthusiasm, never over the top! Overall an endearing movie! I think I'll use my granddaughter as an excuse to go see this one again! Take your family, young and old, and enjoy the ride!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shaggy Dog is a very sprightly and spirited family comedy, that does rely on a lot of slapstick. As daft as it often is, it is endearing and funny, with a truly hilarious performance from Tim Allen as Dave Douglas, a pooch hating lawyer who is bitten by a dog and turns into one. There are a lot of chuckles to be had, particularly Dave's new habits and also when he chases a cat on all fours. But the highlight is the ending, which is wonderfully wacky, thanks to a great pantomimic turn from Robert Downey Jnr as the villain of the piece, especially when he goes literally barking mad. The film is also compensated by a nice soundtrack, a witty screenplay and some truly inspired moments of physical comedy.In fact, in my personal opinion, the only things wrong with this film was the perhaps too leisurely direction and the slushy family values moralising. All in all, a very funny and underrated family comedy. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Shaggy Dog" (2006) Directed By: Brian Robbins Starring: Tim Allen, Kristin Davis, Robert Downey Jr., Zena Grey, Spencer Breslin, Danny Glover, &amp; Shawn Pyfrom MPAA Rating: "PG" (some mild rude humor) I had heard such bad things about this remake of "The Shaggy Dog". Most critics loathed it and IMDb users were quick to pound it with extremely low ratings. So, when I was sitting down to watch it, I expected a disaster?one of the year's worst movies. Did I get what I expected? Well, absolutely not. In fact, I found it to be quite delightful?silly and immature, but a pleasant watch. It was predictably cheesy and I have seen hundreds of movies almost exactly like it before, but there is something to be said for movies that exist solely for the purpose of entertainment. And that is what "The Shaggy Dog" (2006) is. It never expected to break any new ground in cinema and it, most certainly, doesn't, yet it is a film that the entire family can sit down together and watch. The children will laugh at the obvious physical humor and the various animal behaviors and parents will enjoy some of the more mature humor (not crude or bad humor, but humor that most children will not understand). It's an entertaining film with a quick pace. Though, with all of that said, "The Shaggy Dog" (2006) has much room for improvement. The new genetic testing twist on this old story makes the movie a little too weird and the movie falls for so many unnecessary clichés.Dave Douglas (Allen) is the deputy district attorney of his town and is on the path to become the next district attorney. He has a beautiful wife, Rebecca (Davis), and two wonderful children, Carly (Grey) and Josh (Breslin), and is on what could possibly be the biggest case of his life?the prosecution of the animal rights' activist, Justin Forrester (Joshua Leonard), who supposedly attempted to burn down a laboratory, suspected of animal testing. Everything seems to be going perfectly for him, except for the fact that his children don't like him and his relationship with his wife is becoming increasingly strained. However, when his daughter brings home a dog that escaped from this lab and it bites Dave, he finds himself becoming more and more dog-like, until he actually turns into a dog. As a dog, he realizes the problems within his family and also sees the evil and corruption in the company he was once protecting. In the 1959 version of "The Shaggy Dog", a boy turned into a sheep dog due to a magical spell. Somehow, I found that plot to be far more believable. Sure, both scenarios are impossible, but the way this 2006 version presented its plot just didn't come off as realistic. Unfortunately, this was a huge part of the movie. An audience needs to be able to believe what they are watching, no matter how implausible it is. "The Shaggy Dog" (2006) fails in that aspect?probably due to the gaping plot holes.The performances in "The Shaggy Dog" (2006) are good?nothing overly special, but believable. Tim Allen does a nice job, but watching him run around on all-fours was just plain weird, which was not his fault. He gave his all for this movie, though, and that is what counts. Kristin Davis is always delightful and this is especially true here. She is just such a genuine actress. Robert Downey Jr. just didn't completely sell me, unfortunately. He overacted a little too much and came off as silly and comical, rather than eccentric and creepy. Zena Grey and Spencer Breslin did exactly what I expected. They delivered their dialog well and were perfectly adequate given the movie and their roles. Danny Glover could do so much better than a small part in this movie. Any actor could have been cast in his part and I wouldn't have noticed. It would have been different had he had a major part, like Tim Allen, Kristin Davis, and Robert Downey Jr., but he should not be wasted on such a small part. Shawn Pyfrom, like Grey and Breslin, did what I expected him to do, which was perfectly sufficient. Jane Curtin, like Glover, is wasted on a small part?but she does have an important part. It could have still been played by any actress, but Curtin gives it something of her own. She does fine.Overall, "The Shaggy Dog" (2006) is entertainment?pure and simple. It's a fun movie with plenty of laughs. It won't be remembered as a movie that changed cinema forever, but it still serves its purpose. Though, it was certainly not perfect. What was with the excessive use of mediocre CGI? Yes, CGI was necessary for some scenes, but it should have looked more polished?more realistic. Here, it doesn't. The special effects are mediocre and come off as cheesy and laughable. Also, "The Shaggy Dog" (2006) succumbs to so many unnecessary clichés. For example when the keeper of the dog pound bends over, his pants rip, revealing his underwear. Why? What did filmmakers feel would come from this scene? On top of this, it suffers from gaping plot holes. Why did the original dog live so long? If he was just a dog who lived longer than usual, why did he express many human characteristics throughout the movie? Many things just did not connect in this movie, but its target audience (children) will probably not notice and only movie-fans and critics will probably care enough to wonder. When this movie ended, I had a smile on my face and that is what this movie wanted. It wanted to entertain and entertain, it does.Final Thought: Though silly and predictable, "The Shaggy Dog" (2006) is sure to entertain.Overall Rating: 6/10 (B)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Disney's better films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised with the film, Shaggy Dog. Shaggy Dog was the first feature at the drive-in. I avoided seeing this film in the theater and thought that it was okay to see it at the drive-in as you see 2 movies for the price of 1. It was better than the second feature actually. The film gives a dog's point of view on life. Tim Allen is silly enough to make the role believable. The chasing of the tail, frisbees and the shaking of the head to remove water was portrayed perfectly. Shaggy Dog kept the viewer interested with what was going to happen next. The film is a family movie that everyone will like. I wondered why they used a sheep dog? There are many other types that could of been utilized. 7 out of 10. Worth seeing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>cute family flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just sit back and enjoy this movie. I took my 5-year old and 7-year old and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Tim Allen is excellent as the dad. This movie is good, clean, family fun with lots of laughs. Finally a movie with no bad language, profanity, or bathroom jokes. The story line is silly, but there's no need to over-analyze a kid's movie. We need more innocent flicks like this where the good guy wins and the overall message in the end is pro-family. The characters are cute and there are some great scenes with animals. Disney has done a great job with this remake. I would recommend this film for all ages. We are definitely going back to see this a second time because we loved it! A must see movie for anyone who owns a dog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An arbitrary judgment:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The shaggy dog is more or less what you would expect from a movie entitled: the shaggy dog, with Tim Allen in it. This is the kind of movie you see when your flying from Quito to Miami. Thats where i saw it. On the four hour plane ride there isn't much to do except watch the movie or sleep. In this case, i should have chosen to sleep.I must admit, the movie is targeted for children and the younger audience to which it must be more entertaining and comical. You will most likely get what you think you will of this movie, especially if you don't think much of it. Its an original idea, but not a very good one. So to Tim Allen i say: Points for originality, but don't do it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's the magic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I ask, "where's the magic?" I'm not talking about the magic that turns Tim Allen into a sheep dog. I'm talking about the "Disney Magic." I realize that a bunch of you have already commented on this, but now I'd like to add my two cents.The original "Shaggy Dog" movie was released in 1959 (my parents were about three years old). I constantly watched it on video when I was a kid. It was cheesy, sappy, corny, etc. Even though the story was silly, the acting bad, and the special effects tacky, it had a certain charm and squishy Disney cuteness that made it appealing. I watched it recently, and I still liked it even though I'm a 26-year-old man now.The fact that the new movie sucks has nothing to do with the fact that I'm old and jaded. It doesn't have to do with the bad acting (except for Tim Allen, who, as always, did well with what he was given) or lame special effects. Disney has lost its magic. You can only do so many remakes and sequels of a movie before it turns into a cliché and loses all the creativity and charisma of the original. This is about the fourth or fifth remake and/or sequel of the original, and it's not cute any more. It's the Xerox effect. If you keep making copies of something, you lose the all the sharpness and clarity that you began with.Disney has perfected this over the last ten years. They've ruined just about every classic they ever made by coming out with a cheap remake or thrown-together sequel. The Shaggy Dog has gone from being a silly story about an awkward teenager trying to deal with life as all these crazy things start happening to him (totally relatable story, by the way), into a goofy special effects showcase about a lawyer who's prosecuting a tree-hugging hippie teacher, only to find out that the teacher isn't a criminal but was framed by these evil scientists who are doing genetic testing on animals (I could go off on how Disney always tries to put some liberal message into all of its new movies, but this isn't a political website).If the good people at Disney would put more time and effort into making new and original films, they could once again become a great company. Instead they make mediocre original stuff and lackluster rehashes, and they're wasting their money. If all their resources would go into new ventures, we would probably see fewer movies from them each year, but we would once again be astounded and mesmerized by that Disney magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely Not A "Dog"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shaggy Dog" had to be at least mildly amusing. Earlier collaborations between comedian Tim Allen and Disney, including "The Santa Clause" and "Jungle 2 Jungle" were always hilarious. Sticking Tim Allen into a tried-and-true storyline, the oft remade "The Shaggy Dog" was a safe bet on Disney's part. This isn't Tim Allen's funniest movie and this isn't the most vibrant remake of "The Shaggy Dog", but it does manage to be at least mildly amusing all the way through, and at times it's even hilarious.Tim Allen plays a deputy D. A. prosecuting an animal rights activist accused of torching a laboratory in which cruel experiments were allegedly performed on animals. What Allen's character doesn't realize is that a villainous scientist, played by the always brilliant Robert Downey Jr. who has appeared in such films as "The Singing Detective", has kidnapped an eternally youthful and extremely shaggy dog and is performing particularly inhumane experiments on it. The dog escapes and bites the deputy D. A., causing him to periodically and temporarily morph into a shaggy dog, in turn allowing him to get closer to cracking the case and get closer to his family: his son (Spencer Breslin, who has already worked with Tim Allen in "The Santa Clause 2"), his kinda cute daughter (Zena Grey), and his definitely hot wife (Kristen Davis).There are two levels of humor in this movie. Young children will love Tim Allen's goofy physical humor. Older audiences should appreciate the more subtle tricks Tim Allen uses to make his human character seem increasingly dog-like. There are also some nifty computer generated effects, including a series of intriguing mutant animals. There is one special effects trick that is uncalled for, however: ridiculous "cells" that resemble dog-shaped clumps of grass that bark and pant their way through the main character's blood stream. These brief scenes take a lot away from the movie, which isn't anything to howl about, but is still entertaining and not a "dog" by any means.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wish people wouldn't be so hard on this movie. You get exactly what the title promises. It's a tried and tested formula that has been used to death, but that doesn't make this a bad movie. It's fun, it's silly and it's got very stupid dog jokes. I couldn't sit through it again, but i wasn't looking at my watch every 10 minutes. Tim Allen takes the role that he seems quite adept to these days. A normal family man who gets put into extreme circumstances and become a better person because of it. His wife is played by the only tasty one from sex in the city. Which i know isn't pivotal to the plot, I thought it was well worth a mention. His kids are pretty well played to. Lots of son/daughter bonding and a great deal of cheese that US movies seem to preach these days. Anyway, don't be so harsh on a movie that is basically made for kids and aimed at kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I'm not going to write too much in-depth on this movie. It's not a movie to be analyzed. If you only want to see believable antics &amp; possible outcomes? Stay home, make some tea, and SIT YOUR CRANKY BUTT DOWN FOR THE DOCUMENTARY CHANNEL. Boy, some of you must've been really miserable kids whenever cartoons were on TV. Do note that Pixar makes a few shameless references to their past projects. If you see it, you'll know what I mean.This Shaggy Dog Movie: There are some potentially stressful scenes for young children. It involves what is implied to have happened to animals in captivation. Think of weapons that metro police might have to use on an uncontrollable person. Then again, Disney gave me Bambi and Old Yeller. We all know what happened to them. I may never get over that.The script is typical Disney. I remember watching the original Shaggy Dog movie and loving it lots. I don't remember much about what the original, because I was so young. The part to keep in mind, when reading this is: "I remember loving it lots." Little kids beside me with their mum enjoyed it. A retired couple six rows ahead roared the loudest. I gave it a "7" because of the smiles it gave people around me. It was harmless &amp; people knew what to expect.For those that trash this movie because it isn't up to your high tech violent standards? I type this: EVERYONE TURNS: 6... 7, AND 8 YEARS OLD IN THEIR LIFE. You get the picture. Don't make fun of something you've outgrown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid Remake and Dependable Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A solid cast and nostalgic feel blend to make the newest incarnation of the old faithful, The Shaggy Dog, a fine evening out with the kids. Every decade or so, Disney recreates the movie that is the paradigm of Disney family fare. Whereas in both the 1959 original, starring Fred MacMurray and Tommy Kirk, and in this remake, the star turns into a sheep dog at the most inconvenient times, in this remake, it is the dad who transforms, not the son. Like the original, the laughs are not side-splitting, but rather the kind that make you smile.Tim Allen (The Santa Claus, Christmas With the Kranks), a dependable actor, wears his role like a comfortable pair of tennis shoes. Typecast as the lovable - if insensitive - dad, Allen seems resigned to his role, and plays it well. Kristin Davis (The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl) is believable as the frustrated wife and mother.Zena Grey (In Good Company) and Spencer Breslin (Cat in the Hat) perform like old troopers, but the stand out performance goes to Robert Downey Jr, who excels as the neurotic nemesis.Like always, this Disney flick earns 10 stars for clean family fun, and an 8 for special effects, but because of a weakness in the script (the writers couldn't quite make up their mind why our star turns into a dog), I must rate The Shaggy Dog a 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the first Shaggy Dog and I wasn't sure if this one would hold up. However, my kids love the "Santa Clause" movies so I thought we'd try this. My kids (7 and 3) enjoyed the movie while my husband and I were nearly rolling on the floor laughing. Yes, it's silly... but it is supposed to be! Come on guys, it is a movie about a guy turning into a dog! While not overly cheesy, it still has some which is okay in a family movie. I'm glad to see Disney going back to family friendly movies that are just good fun.Other movies that my kids like are "Freaky Friday" and "Cheaper by the Dozen." For another good classic comedy, try the original, "Yours, Mine, &amp; Ours."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Synopsis) Dr. Kozak (Robert Downey Jr.) kidnaps a 300-year old Tibetan sheepdog in an attempt to discover the dog's secret of longevity and produce a fountain of youth drug. Unfortunately, all he has produced are animal mutations such as a king cobra-canine with a tail, a dog-frog that barks, and other mutations that are part dog. The sheepdog escapes the lab and is rescued by Carly Douglas (Zena Grey), who takes him home. Deputy District Attorney Dave Douglas (Tim Allen) is prosecuting Carly's teacher for the firebombing of Dr. Kozak's lab. Dave hates dogs, and after he is bitten by the sheepdog, the dog is sent to the pound. The dog has injected Dave with some of his DNA cells, and Dave begins to have canine urges and eventually, becomes a sheepdog. Dave learns the truth about his family and the drug company as a dog.(My Comment) This is a cute movie that you can take your children to. There are several funny scenes like the bathroom and park scenes that are just hilarious. I think they wasted their money on the CG effects on the cat chasing scene. If you look at the Shaggy Dog poster, you will see Tim Allen's eerie eyes. I enjoyed this movie, and you must remember that this is only a movie, and don't take the plot too seriously. (Note: The dog is actually a bearded collie.) (Walt Disney, Run time 1:38, Rated PG) (5/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 2006 re-make of the Classic 1959 "The Shaggy Dog" is an adequate re-make in my opinion, although I do have more fond memories of the older version. That being said, then this 2006 version starring Tim Allen is still an entertaining and fun movie for the entire family.The story needs very little introduction, so I will make it brief and to the point. "The Shaggy Dog" is about Dave Douglas, a busy lawyer, who is bitten by a sheep dog and finds himself changing between dog and human shape.This is not really one of the best Tim Allen movies in terms of comedy aspects and laughs. So on that account, you might be a bit disappointed if you watch the movie hoping to find something hilarious. This is a family movie spiced up with some comedy elements. I sat down with the Family to watch "The Shaggy Dog", so we got our money's worth here.They did manage to draft some nice names for the movie, which did add a good deal of enjoyment to the movie. The movie did benefit well from having Tim Allen in the lead, of course. But also Kristin Davis, Danny Glover, Jane Curtin and Robert Downey Jr. did add something good to the movie, despite not having all that big roles individually.One thing that didn't really go well with me was the lack of visuals in the scenes where Dave Douglas changed from man to dog, and vice versa. It would have been a nice detail to the movie if we had actually seen the transition on the screen. And because this was lacking from the movie, it sort of dragged the overall enjoyment down a notch."The Shaggy Dog" is a fun enough movie for the family, especially if you have children watching too. However, this 2006 version is not as good as the original movie in my opinion.All in all, an adequate movie, although it wasn't outstanding. As such I am rating it six out of ten stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first review that popped up when I looked was from Christian123, who rated it "1". Who do these people think they are reviewing a children's movie as if it was made to win an academy award. I'm 70 and watched it with my grandkids, ages 8 and 6. We all thought it was great. Funny, family friendly and full of great visual goofiness. Some reviewers think that if a movie isn't full of sex, violence and cussing it isn't any good. Sort of dumb thinking. The beauty of this type of film is that while it is designed for kids, the writers put in enough "grownup" humor that may go over the kid's head, adults can appreciate it. Watch the movie and laugh a little. And to the reviewer who don't like it, get over yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shaggy Dog is a decent remake of the 1960's original with Tim Allen, Robert Downey Jr and a solid supporting cast. It's an enjoyable popcorn film aimed at kids but with plenty of jokes and physical humor adults can enjoy. It deserves a 7.5 or an 8 but I gave it a 10 because of the rash of low ratings by people who have it in for Tim Allen or films for children.The IMDb rating is a shame and is not the first time that a decent film has terrible ratings (see, for example, The Wild Thornberrys Movie) because of its unrestricted rating system (compare, for example, the rating on Amazon). IMDb needs to review its rating system and come up with something better than unrestricted rating which allows groups of Internet users to sabotage the ratings of good films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shaggy Dog (2006): Dir: Brian Robbins / Cast: Tim Allen, Robert Downey Jr., Kristen Davis, Spencer Breslin, Zena Grey: Remake of the 1959 Disney classic about personality and distinction. For whatever reason there is an ageless sheepdog that is captured and in situations too lame to discuss in detail a lawyer played by Tim Allen is bitten by a dog thus gaining the habits and eventually appearance of a dog. Although Brian Robbins produces some unique point of voice aspect s, he is still directing the same dog dung as when he made Good Burger and Hardball. Varsity Blues remains his one recommended gem. Tim Allen scratches, pants, snarls, chases cats, fetches, and even uses the urinal with one leg lifted. Robert Downey Jr. should fire his agent after this embarrassing performance as a scientist doing illegal testing on animals. Kristen Davis is flat as Allen's wife. She is basically there to suspect nothing and be supportive while the kids eventually get wind of the situation and attempt to help out. Spencer Breslin and Zena Grey play the children who struggle to help their father figure this stupid dilemma out. The special effects pass the test but the screenplay is nothing more than a canvas for dumb dog jokes, most of which are expected. Theme of limitations done justice in the original while the makers of this film produce a remake that should be buried. Score: 3 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apparently, The Shaggy Dog is a remake from the 1959 Disney classic with the same name, which I haven't seen yet. I was overly surprised how much I liked the film, but perhaps it was just the animal lover in me. I could see through the formulaic plot and the silliness of the film, but those animals were cute and I always like efforts people put in to save animals. This is terrific family entertainment and the kids will enjoy the film. It is obviously not a great film, but it is a good, earnest film.Brian Robbin's film is about a man named Dave Douglas who is an Assistant DA and never has time for his family and hates animals. One day, he gets bitten by an escaped sheepdog, who was captured in Nepal and has secret aging powers. After being bitten, Dave's life is turned upside down as he turns into a sheepdog.The acting isn't terrific, but it's passable. Tim Allen made for a quite funny Douglas and it was entertaining to see him acting as a dog. Robert Downey Jr is okay as the man who has an agenda with his company. Kristen Davis made for a good wife of Douglas. We also get good appearances from Danny Glover and Philip Baker Hall, but I wonder if they are needed in the first place.Overall, the Shaggy Dog is good for family entertainment and a film not to be taken seriously by movie fanatics. There are many amusing moments, such as these grown men acting as dogs. It is not that realistic, but it does have a fun story. The ending was a bit weak, however. But my mother enjoyed this film and I won't lie when I say I did as well. It is not the greatest, but it's passable entertainment. I rate this film 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So Disneys' go to guy Allen is back in his Santa Clause mode, but this time he turns into a dog.He plays an assistant DA, who is trying to lock up some gut because he is accusing a huge corporation of testing on animals.And obviously he ignores his family and breaks promises.Hilarity ensues when he is bitten by a dog, and it's DNA passes through his bloodstream and the inevitable happens.If you've seen any Allen film made by Disney in the last twenty years, you've seen this. But strangely enough, this film is quite disturbing in scenes that are supposed to be laugh out loud funny.Seeing a warped Allen chase a cat, shake after having a shower, sleeping on a bed in a weird way, or sniffing and growling, were supposed to be the key hilarity factor in this.But it isn't. In fact, it's downright freaky in a way that just cannot be described. Allen looks like he's made a big mistake signing on to this, and the rest of the cast look bewildered, apart from Downey Jr. who looks like he is just off his face.The effects are poor, and for a film that's aimed at youngsters, anything featuring the bad guy inject a man so he will be paralysed for months, and Allen being nude four times, has to raise alarm bells.And the surfing dog is stuff of nightmares.A Disney horror, in more ways than one...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Review originally published on March 7, 2006:Here we go with another remake of a film that wasn't all that great to begin with (see "Yours, Mine &amp; Ours" "The Fog," and "The Hills Have Eyes" as recent examples). Original was released in 1959 and starred Fred MacMurrary and Tommy Kirk, among others, and wasn't the high mark of Disney entertainment, although it was not that bad.Competently directed by Brian Robbins (TV series "One Tree Hill"), this new version features Tim Allen ("Christmas With The Kranks") as a Los Angeles district attorney, Dave Douglas, trying to climb the corporate ladder ? while ignoring his lovely wife, Rebecca (Kristin Davis, "Shark Boy &amp; Lava Girl," the TV series "Sex and the City"), and two annoyingly cute kids, Carly (Zena Grey, "In Good Company") and Josh (Spencer Breslin, "Cat in the Hat").Dave is prosecuting Carly's teacher, who is accused of firebombing a local chemical company because they experiment on animals (fun family plot, so far), but, in a zany mix-up, the lawyer is bitten by a 300-year-old Tibetan sheepdog (although some sources identify this breed as a bearded collie).This causes the special effects to go into high gear, as he grows a floppy tongue, super sensitive hearing and the ability to run on all fours before finally turning into a sheepdog (or bearded collie) himself.Thank goodness he communicates through inner dialogue, though, and not creepy animated animal mouth movements. His effort to relate his new form to his family is also rather amusing (as they think he has abandoned them), using a Scrabble game to spell out his dilemma and finding out his son would rather be in "Grease" than play football (hey, who wouldn't?).Meanwhile, (as a pup) he finds out that corporate hack, Dr. Kozak (Robert Downey, Jr.) is indeed using animals to develop a fountain of youth drug. The effects are lacking somewhat when we see the beasts (a ridiculous dog-frog and cobra-canine mutations, as well as rabbits, monkeys and rats that bark), which are as cheap and silly as those featured in one of the worst films of 2005, "A Sound Of Thunder."Kids will like this, and adults will not be too put off, either, but you'd probably be wiser to just rent or buy the original, for its better acting, more interesting storyline and absence of Tim Allen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There were times when I pretty much found this sickening!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally saw "The Shaggy Dog" from 1959 for the first time earlier this month, and while I found it to be no family masterpiece, I still thought it was pretty good. I remember when this 2006 remake came out, and I saw that Tim Allen, a comedian I saw in more than one movie in my childhood, starred in it. I never saw this family movie when it was first out, and didn't know it was a remake, but now know that it's the second remake of the 1959 Disney film, the first one being a TV film from 1994, which I haven't seen and don't care if I never do. After finally watching the original, I intended to watch this theatrically released remake, but I did think it would be far inferior to the version I had previously seen, and now, after seeing it, I think I was correct.A 300 year old Bearded Collie is kidnapped from a Buddhist monastery in Tibet by a group of geneticists led by Dr. Kozak! The animal is brought back to the United States, where the scientists begin to study his mutation, which is what has made him live so long, and intend to make life-extending medicine out of it! Meanwhile, Dave Douglas is a deputy district attorney who hates dogs, and his teenage daughter, Carly, is one of the activists who accuse Grant &amp; Strickland, the company that has secretly kidnapped the dog, of cruel animal testing. The Bearded Collie manages to escape, and is found by Carly and her boyfriend, Trey, as they are searching for evidence of animal testing. This dog isn't the proof they're looking for, but they bring him back to the Douglas home to keep as a pet, calling him Shaggy. Dave obviously doesn't approve when he sees this, and Shaggy ends up biting him, so the mutated dog is taken to the pound. After this, Dave soon starts acting like a dog, and then actually turns into one! Tim Allen plays the same kind of role I remember seeing him play when I was a kid in the 90's (though certainly not in "Toy Story"), and that's a neglectful, insensitive father. This felt a little tiresome to me when I saw him play this role again here. Needless to say, since this is a comedy, one would obviously want laughs from it, but personally, I don't think I found any of those (I didn't keep a straight face throughout, but usually did). There are many gags involving Dave acting like a dog while in human form, and these may be funny to a lot of kids, but I just found them consistently lame and SO cheap that anyone could come up with them, no comedic talent required! Unfortunately, none of the other gags are funny enough to make up for this. I found some of the film pretty much disgusting, with its lame gags and clichés! Later on, I did find that the plot gets more exciting, after being pretty dull for the most part beforehand, and if this change didn't happen, then maybe even my 4/10 rating would be too generous! It seems that movie remakes can often be poorly received, and understandably, this is one of them. The original "Shaggy Dog" isn't hilarious, but it sure is funnier than this lacklustre 2006 version! If this remake (with lots of differences from the original) starring Tim Allen is strictly for kids, then it was way too late for me by the time it came out, as I was almost twenty years old by then. I guess some adults do like this version, and I won't fault them for that, but I really think kids are much more likely to enjoy it. It's definitely not one of those really well crafted family films that can be equally entertaining for all ages. The 1959 version has its share of flaws, and I can understand why it's not one of the most popular productions from the early decades of Disney, but I've made it clear that I still like it a lot better than this theatrical remake, and I'm sure I'm not alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually just finished watching this movie, and was curious to see how it was rated. I am so surprised that its rated low. I had a really nice time watching it. Its funny, feel good, and I would recommend watching it with kids. I think people are taking this movie too seriously. Its a comedy about a guy turning into a dog. Its a family movie. Someone wrote something about product placement.....LMAO really? I mean unless that product is scrabble and wanting a dog, then sure. Give this movie a chance. I was having a movie watching night and gave it a try, and I certainly don't regret it. I feel happy, positive and nice after watching this. Its a little cheesy but come on guys...its Disney!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Allen, talk to the hand and the behind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing The Shaggy Dog, I realized something. Tim Allen looked really stupid acting like a dog. But, for a guy that's clueless, you deserve a rude awakening. The dog bite on his hand gave him loads to think about. He even had to become a dog to prove a point, especially when your daughter's telling you the truth. He realized that after he became a dog, she was right. Kozak was up to something. I'm glad Kozak got bit too, in order to prove what was going on in that lab. Kozak did a good thing revealing the truth as well by acting like a dog. After he acted like a dog and chased his tail, he was busted. I kept singing "Somebody's in trouble, Kozak's in trouble," until he was out of the court room. By the way, I hope he gets a chance to go outside if the prison guards let him. Who knows, he might keep getting hit with a rolled up newspaper while in prison. As far as Allen, he can resume letting out any dog expressions since he probably doesn't have a choice. He got infected. So most of the time, he can't control himself. Don't worry. Kirk Cameron had to deal with it in You Lucky Dog, only without the infection from a dog bite. He learned to deal with it after acting like a dog for 3 times. Which is 3 strikes, you're stuck. He got use to it and was able to let his feelings out. I said this once and I'll say it again "Tim Allen, go ahead and act like a dog." Let it all out. Tim Allen needed to wake up and realize what's going on. So, acting like a dog and becoming a dog proved a point. He had to do it to prove a point. I've been thinking about what role Tim Allen played in this movie and the role Kirk Cameron played in You Lucky Dog. Sometimes when they act brainless, I usually would say "Talk to the hand" and move on. And there are other times when I realize that they acted like a dog to prove a point. They both saved someone's lives by acting like a dog. Sometimes acting like a dog was pretty helpful. It was helpful for Lucky in You Lucky Dog and it was helpful for Forster in this movie. He was going to prison for something that he didn't do. So, we should tell Cameron and Allen thank you for acting like a dog because it helped proved a point and it saved someone's behind. They both looked stupid, but who cares? They did it prove a point. Plus, they pretty much got their treats in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great remake, mild spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those comedies that one needs to watch without cynicism, sort of like 'The Money Pit'. For what it is, it is delightful. Clean, no bad language (that I remember), great and funny examples of Tim Allen's developing the characteristics of a dog while at the same time discovering his failures as a Dad.It seems to me that a great number of people that contribute to IMDb don't think a movie is good unless it has at least several of the following attributes: Attacks America, promotes immorality, violence, perverse values and is filled with profanity.I somehow missed the rude humor (that gave it a PG rating) in the movie and think it could have gotten a G rating. It's better than most Hollywood fare for one's family and something one wouldn't mind in one's library if one cares what kind of things one's children see and hear.This was to the original as the remake of 'Freaky Friday' was to its original -- a lot of fun that some will think is better.</fullReview>

Touching, funny, messages about family, good special effects on the animals, I would say this is just as good for adults as it is for kids. Why can't movies be something to sit down for 90 minutes and just be enjoyed anymore? I am assuming some of the ratings are from teens which brought down the rating. No swearing, killing, sex or blood, so it's a piece of junk to them. Wholesome entertainment is junk to most of them. Tim does an excellent job as does Robert Downey Jr, and the rest of the cast. This is a quality family film. I highly suggest it to everyone with a sense of humor and someone who has a heart and believes in family.</fullReview>

It is funny, silly, and it has a lot of great jokes in it. Disney made some funny special affects with animals in the movie. Disney did a great job on this movie, and Tim Allen did a great job acting in it. It is different from a lot of comedies. I believe that this movie should get a higher rating. This movie is supposed to be funny. The first time I saw it, it made me laugh a lot.

I would highly recommend any families to watch this with their kids, as it has good family values tied in to. Of course even if your just yourself, if your up for a touching family flick with humor mixed in then its good too.

I was extremely disappointed , the filmed failed to be entertaining ,was full of cliché's about fatherhood and the villains where weak. Tim Allen is an excellent comic actor but he failed to make his character believable. The potential for laughs where many but the writers or producers or whomever couldn't manage it. Perhaps they should have used the original script at least it was a success. Disney should at least put a greater effort into improving the film when doing a remake. This is not their first failure with remakes however.</fullReview>

If the grown ups had seen it by themselves, we might not have laughed, but with the kids laughing we were laughing out loud too. Its no date movie but fun for the family. By the way, its okay for a movie to be made for kids. Its silly, but Tim Allen does do a good dog impersonation! His human turning into a dog is actually better than Dean Jones. There is virtually no similarity to the original movie, but so what? This movie is much more politically correct with animal testing being a central theme. And it did set itself up for a sequel. The movie will probably pay well for Disney in DVD sales and repeat showings on Disney Channel.</fullReview>

Regardless of how lame the story is and surprised I was to see a good actor like Robert Downey Jnr appearing in this kind of film. Tim Allen is perfect for the part of a dog though I do prefer him in old comedies. However it provided 90 mins of moan free time for my 2 who had a great time. Mind you my 2 yr old laughs at the Tweenies so there is no helping her really. My opinion would be if you have nothing else worth watching and you have young children give it a go.

		<fullReview>It is now a fact of life...remakes are now practically their own genre. Now in my opinion as a film goer that's not a bad thing, I don't care what anyone says. There is nothing wrong with a good remake and I don't believe anything should be spared from a remake as long as it's done well, entertaining, fun....it potentially gives a whole new spin on a film to a whole new generation and that's good!! You can't go to a theater anymore without at least one remake playing. The Fog, Ocean's 11, The Amytiville Horror, Assault on Precinct 13, When A Stranger Calls...these are some of the better remakes as of recently. I can't honestly say I remember the original Shaggy Dog or it's follow ups but I love Disney films and in all fairness to a remake it's been nearly 5 decades since the original. I must admit The Shaggy Dog remake disappointed me which makes me very sad because I so badly wanted to love it.Tim Allen takes the lead as dog hating, hard working, family man Assistant D.A. Dave Douglas. Allen still does amusing physical comedy and he should be treated as more of a stand up comedian than they do. The Shaggy Dog had some amazing potential for terrific one liners with Allen's voice over when he is the dog but his script falls flat and he never really delivers any funny lines. However Allen still does a decent job, he's good on the big screen as the leading man. He is getting a little old and it shows but he's decent. Unfortunately they pegged a wife who looks like his daughter opposite him. Kristin Davis plays his wife. Now she does a good job, don't get me wrong but opposite Allen they look like father and daughter. Allen can't pull off a younger wife. They do have okay chemistry but they just aren't believable. Robert Downey Jr. is an absolute joke (and not in a funny, comedy way) as Dr. Kozak, the "bad guy" who is experimenting on animals in order to discover the secret to long lasting youth. He looks strung out (coincidence??) and he's annoying and he's never a viable threat to Allen's character. There is no bad guy vs good guy to this. Spencer Breslin, and Zena Grey play the Douglas children and they both do a decent job. This is one of Breslin's better roles as I've always found him a little annoying. The kids are used sparingly which could be a good thing or bad?? Danny Glover shows up briefly as Allen's boss (poor, poor Danny!) A more welcome cameo was Jane Curtin as the tough as nails and annoyed judge.I don't blame the lack of entertainment in this film on the cast (except Downey) it's really the lack luster script. The story is decent and kudos to them for trying to put a really good spin of a story on The Shaggy Dog who is a Tibetan dog that is 300 years old because his dog years work in reverse. It's almost too complicated of a story for such a simple film. The comedy relies about 90% on Allen behaving like a dog as a human or animals behaving likes dog (ie: Rabbits, frogs, snakes, monkeys.) The human acting like a dog thing gets old really quick!! Allen as a dog is quite amusing but as stated earlier the potential for quick witted voice over a la Look Who's Talking never happens. The film is not a complete loss...little children will adore it!! It's easy to follow and has juvenile slapstick humor. There are some genuinely amusing moments, most noted is Allen's first appearance in court when his dog attributes are beginning to show, and the animals escaping from the lab. And one of the classic moments is when Allen as the dog leaps from a bridge and yells "From Infinity To Beyond" (a reference from his voice work in Toy Story as the infamous Buzz Lightyear.) Talented director Brian Robbins who did great work on Varsity Blues, and The Perfect Score should not make family films. It lacked heart and passion and even the morality lesson Disney is famous for doesn't touch home at all. So I suggest not seeing this one unless you're bringing a really young one who will probably laugh to no end, otherwise a big disappointment. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to see this movie, but when I saw that it got a user rating of 2.0, thought maybe it was too horrible. I read the user reviews, and it seemed a lot better than that, but I thought I'd pass. Then I went over to some friends' house, and their 13-year-old son said, "Why do you care what rating it got? If you aren't expecting it to be a great movie, then you could still just go and see it and have some laughs and have a good time." I decided he was right, and I really enjoyed it. I loved the "evil plot", in which Robert Downey, Jr.'s character had captured a 300-year-old sheep dog in order to extract material that could produce immortality in man, even though some of his early experiments produced some weird part-dog/part-other animal creatures. In the end, it played out like a funny sci-fi movie, but with a message: Tim Allen's assistant D.A. character was spending too much time on his job, which included a trial against a teacher who protested the way they were using animals at the company where Downey's character worked. It took changing to a dog to be able to see that he was missing many things that were going on with his family, and that they were all suffering for it. Then he was able to reorder his priorities, as well as go after the bad guy!It is not surprising that this theme of spending so much time on one's job surfaces so frequently. It is endemic in our society. But enough of all that. Just take time to go and see the movie and enjoy it, and forget the ratings! This wasn't supposed to be a piece on rocket science!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A typical witty, bright, funny Disney film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shaggy Dog/2006/*** Main Stars: Tim Allen Robert Downey Jr. Kristin DavisThe typical funny, serious, and touching Disney Film Productions brings to you another funny, serious, and touching film called The Shaggy Dog based on the original The Shaggy Dog (1959) and The Shaggy D.A. (1976). This remake is based a bit more on The Shaggy D.A because Tim Allen's character Dave Douglas is supposedly going to be promoted one and his wife Rebecca (Kristin Davis) seems excited for the promotion. The film opens with a police force in a helicopter looking for a dog, which is shaggy and will be the star of the film, which is over one hundred years old since every seven years it lives one year or something like that. So yes we know it's old and blahbitty bloo but yet that's not the main part of the film. Before I saw the film in the theater, I was pondering about how Tim Allen is going to turn into a dog/human that acts like one. To me it was rather intelligent; actually the whole movie was with the more modern screenplay to follow by with reaction of cells, mutated animals, the whole chestnut. And so Dave is the defendant against the plaintiff who committed arson ("allegedly") and whom Robert Downey Junior's character Dr. Kozak wants guilty so he can become wealthy instead of Lance Strickland (Philip Baker Hall) getting all the money for himself. You'll find out the jury's decision and what led to it. I really thought the movie was intelligent not only because there were six writers of the film but yet the film itself somewhat showed it? The music by the famous composer Alan Menken was very well done and the acting was impressive for a Disney film. I could tell it took a lot of time to train the actual dog itself because of the typing on the laptop with the pencil and looking up and down at the right time. The movie was bright, had a sense of love, humor, seriousness, etc. It wasn't the best becuaaaaase it was kiddy and there are more movie genres to like better than this one. Yet the film went along easily/smoothly? When Dave would see a cat, he would chase it and when he'd see a dog he'd get anxious. In the elevator, if someone commanded his or her dog to sit, he would instead. If he saw food he would be tempted to take it and eat it himself then slowly stop and say sorry embarrassed for what he's done. He'd sip his coffee by licking it and eat his cereal face down. Everything you would not see a normal human do like growling at an opposing witness in the courtroom who's not on your side. All these things seemed funny? When your heart rate goes down, you're human. When your heart rate goes up, you're dog. When you turn back into a human from dog form be sure to be in your own home by yourself or in a stall in a bathroom which Tim Allen failed to do numerous times. This was one of the few Disney films that kept me watching besides Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. I truly liked the story and how he turned into a dog and how he turned back human. Then there are other matters going on at home that soon transform into problems. I think you'll enjoy this film. Movie directed by Brian Robbins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oscar-worthy? Probably not (unless special effects). Some people will be amazed at what Tim Allen can do with his tongue. But my 8-year old was laughing out loud (as was I) and dreaming about being a dog for the next couple days. Definitely not just repackaged garbage. The movie also pulls some predictable heartstrings when it comes to fathers' relationships with their children and spouses. The Bearded Collie was an exceptionally fine actor, and most of the child actors were natural. Of course, parts of the plot were a bit sketchy with regard to reality, but what do you expect from a film about a man who turns into a dog? Hopefully, not much more than some good laughs. A terrific family film, a decent overall movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake unlike the 1959 original is entertaining using a versatile cast and some very cool special effects. Deputy D.A. Dave Douglas(Tim Allen) is knee deep in a case involving an animal lab that is secretly working on a genetic-mutation serum. Dave is an absentee husband and father. His family life is coming undone. If things couldn't get worse, he is accidentally infected by a dog bite and periodically turns into a "shaggy" dog. Some situations will induce belly laughs.Allen could have easily taken a backseat to Robert Downey Jr, who is hilarious as the movie's villain. Also notable work is turned in by Kristen Davis, Danny Glover and Spenser Breslin. Some of the humor is a bit rude, but shouldn't stop the whole family from enjoying THE SHAGGY DOG.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll admit right off the bat that I am a fan of Tim Allen. I never really watched his television show "Home Improvement" but really liked him in films like "Galaxy Quest", "Big Trouble", and "The Santa Clause". But when I saw the trailer for "The Shaggy Dog" I shook my head with disbelief. How could Tim Allen do such a stupid movie? I asked myself. But I figured I would give the film a shot because sometimes the marketing is very misleading and the actual film itself could be decent. So tonight, I ventured to my local cinema to catch the 8:00pm showing of "The Shaggy Dog"."The Shaggy Dog" is about a man named Dave Douglas (Tim Allen) who works for a big law firm in Los Angeles. Dave is a man that is so caught up with his work that he doesn't even realize he is ignoring his wife Rebecca (Kristen Davis) and his two kids Carly (Zena Grey) and Josh (Spencer Breslin). Dave is currently working on the biggest case of his career which involves animal testing. If Dave wins this case, he will become the head D.A. at the firm. But when a dog from the testing facility escapes and comes to the Douglas house. This is where Dave's priorities begin to change as Dave turns into a dog and sees his family and himself from a totally new and unique perspective.I'll be really honest with my review here and state that "The Shaggy Dog" isn't a great movie by any means. The story is silly and the film reminded me at times of the Rob Schneider film "The Animal" but is "The Shaggy Dog" as bad as the trailers lead you to believe? Not really. The movie had good intentions but was just poorly executed. The movie really is a feel good family flick but it isn't very original nor is it very believable.What "The Shaggy Dog" does well is it delivers a good message which is "Be there for your family". What makes "The Shaggy Dog" fail is the fact that the film is so incredibly silly. I think the writers of this film tried so hard to make the film childish that it caused the film to be overly stupid at parts. The whole scene where Tim Allen chases the cat like a dog is really too much and wasn't necessary. I feel if the film took itself a little more seriously instead of trying to be constantly funny, the final product would have been much better.But that's not saying that the film is a total disaster like I thought it would be when I walked into it earlier today. It was a decent family film and kids under 10 will probably adore it but parents will probably beg for it to become a little less goofy. The movie itself was a decent, silly film that could have been executed better but instead turned into a very average family film.Tim Allen actually does a decent job here although as I mentioned before not as good as he could have done. This is probably my 2nd least favorite film of his, the first being "Jungle to Jungle" which was also made by Disney. His performance was just a little too over the top here and it seemed like he was trying too hard to be funny. The family members on the other hand did a good job. I liked the roles that Kristen Davis, Zena Grey, and Spencer Breslin played and I felt that they all did a pretty good job. Also Robert Downey Jr. wasn't bad either as the evil mastermind. Overall the cast was a lot better than the actual film.Brian Robbins was the director of this film and I feel that this is where the problem with the film lies. A director has total control of the film and I think Brain Robbins still doesn't have a good director touch yet. Robbins has brought us several bad movies including "Good Burger", "Ready to Rumble" and the absolutely dreadful "The Perfect Score". So looking at his previous experience I can see why "The Shaggy Dog" wasn't an excellent movie. The problem here is that he isn't that good of a director and that's why this film wasn't exactly good. I would think that he would have caught on by now but he is still missing the bar on what it takes to direct a good movie.In the end, I didn't hate "The Shaggy Dog" like I thought I would have. It's a passable family film that kids under the age of 10 will probably love. Being a fan of not only Tim Allen but family films in general, I was disappointed with the outcome of this movie. It had some redeeming elements to it but not enough to save the lame script and the poor directing. If the movie didn't try so hard to be funny, it probably could have been funnier. I wouldn't recommend this movie as a full price ticket at the local cinema but it's an OK matinée or DVD rental.MovieManMenzel's final rating for "The Shaggy Dog" is a 6/10. If you have young ones, take them because they will love it even if you feel it's a bit too much at times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The piece of crap.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You want to know how disgustingly, morbidly PC Disney has become? They put trousers on a monkey because they are afraid to show naked animals in case parents are offended. Can you believe that? What is this world coming to? Walt would be spinning in his grave if he were not cryogenically frozen.Tim Allen plays Dave Douglas, a bad dad who neglects his wife and kids and does way too much overtime. He's a lawyer you see and his current big case involves an animal research company who make poodles into frogs or something like that. Their goal is to make the elixir of everlasting life so naturally one would make a poodle into a frog to achieve such a noble ambition.Dave is bit by one of the dogs and now is infected with dogness. This causes him to periodically turn into a dog and 'hilarity' ensues as he tries to keep up his case and maintain his family life. Why on earth would you want to see this? Tim Allen has already played a neglectful dad who learns important lessons after undergoing a weird metamorphosis in 2 Santa Clause movies so he's not broadening his role much. And how many movies are there with bad dads (always the dad and never the mum, eh?) who are usually lawyers who learn the same crap? About 86 billion!I can understand why Tim Allen is in this as he is constantly scraping the bottom of the sludge barrel but how the hell did they get Robert Downey Jnr, Danny Glover AND Philip Baker Hall do to this? They must owe their bookmakers a fair whack. No one in their right mind could read this script and find it worthy of their talents.So not only does the story stink of the worst clichés but it's woefully misjudged and badly directed. The scene where Mrs. Douglas confronts her dog husband and hears him bark 'I wuff woo' is pretty much the most disturbing scene I've ever come across. And I've watched snuff. When they look into each others eyes I seriously thought she'd start making out with him.And when the film finishes...is Dave still going to turn into a dog? Is he cured? Who knows? Do I really care that much? Why? Why do I do this myself? If you really hate life then see this movie. If you are of sound body and mind then save the pennies for guns, drugs and ill hookers. It's money better spent. Trust me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Remake. But Still a Remake !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forgive my mind. This is wholly an above-average entertainment. The script, the directing, the editing.. All the elements delivered a fantasy about how the dog can be more present and helpful than the absent dad sometimes (acrid metaphor I know, but smartly done). It is too innocent for its time, but really enjoyable and exciting. All the cast did memorable job. Zena Grey, for instance, was ultra-cute. But OH MY GOD Tim Allen was on the top of his game. He seemed classic; having the charisma, the talent, the credibility, and being that lovable. He just excelled in the details looking like a real dog for all the time. His performance here alone doesn't deserve to be watched for one time at all.This time I have only few points to talk about harshly; they didn't poke fun out of a great talent like Jane Curtin, dealing with her character as just a judge. Danny Glover is totally wasted in a role I thought it would've been better if they ever handed it over the old movie's lead (Dean Jones), who was very much alive at the moment, hitting his mid seventies. The matter of (Allen) losing his clothes, with the cell phone, more than once then nobody notices that (or how he regains that every time) bugged me slightly. The character played by Robert Downey Jr. was yes evil and stuff, but I think he just got a point about the freeness of the scientific researches that looked at last utterly refused?! And at the end the problem of the lead turning into a dog wasn't solved at all !? But maybe that was deliberate in case this movie hit it high and admitted a sequel. However, still the deepest problem is that while I was so happy during the viewing, I found myself all sad, feeling pity for Disney in the same time too!Look at this little discovering of mine; since the late 1960s to the late 1970s there were many original movies. 3 of them got the name, and the fame, of (The Love Bug ? 1968), (Freaky Friday ? 1976), and (The Shaggy D.A. ? 1976) which was a sequel to 1959 movie (The Shaggy Dog). After 2 decades, Disney would exploit the success of these cinematic hits however on a TV level. So, we witnessed follow-ups or remakes like (The Love Bug ? 1997), (Freaky Friday ? 1995), and (The Shaggy Dog ? 1994). Thank god that the IMDb exists to know that I'm right.Then, in the next decade, the same good old movies will turn into another follow-ups or remakes again yet for the big screen; as (Herbie Fully Loaded ? 2005), (Freaky Friday ? 2003), and our dear (The Shaggy Dog ? 2006). It's not the circulation of nature. It's rather the story of copyrights have to be used. And studios that got lately not many brilliant scripts to be made.. that's unnatural enough for me!At first, I was thinking about a title for my review like "Disney is forever". But by the ending I was suggesting things like "Disney is remaking forever!" or "Disney's remaking is forever"!! Simply, if that is a wonderful remake of a wonderful original movie, then where are the wonderful original movies of today?! And why, just why, all of these efforts can't be used in another, more original, and as good, movies?! And how about the fact of these 3 last remakes as the best of what I've had from Disney in the past 10 years?! Many questions jump up and down in my mind because of this fun movie...So that's why I said at the start: forgive my mind! This is a movie where the worst of it is that it's a remake!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film when I saw it in the cinema. I doubt that I'd buy it on DVD, or rent it. But it was enjoyable and funny, with some innuendos!! The plot was the father not having enough time for his family. He ends up getting bitten by the Tibetan dog (it wasn't really, I have a Tibettan Terrier - small dog - this one was probably, well i'm not sure what kind of dog it was) and then he'd turn into a dog when something triggers a dog-like thing in his head. e.g. a person throwing a stick. It's a "And They All Lived Happily Ever After" film, but I guess it has to be, if it's going to be a U film. The kids in the cinema while I was there certainly enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm rating this high because while it's not Shakespearean theater or some other serious film, this film succeeds at what it purports to do: give an average family some light, springtime entertainment. As an adult who has seen these type of films before, yes, I pretty much knew where Tim Allen's character was headed from the beginning. However, that did not detract from the fun of seeing him go there. Robert Downey was a delight as the bad guy, and I felt the kids in the film were developed rather well for a Disney film. Kristen Davis also brought a rather commanding depth to the mom role. As we watch the film, we do get to care about the main characters, and we laugh as the silly things happen. Personally, I don't always need a brand-new, serious film in order to have a meaningful theater experience. Just going and laughing along with my six and eleven year old kids made the film fun. The actors carried it well, and it was what I like to expect from a Disney family film.</fullReview>

Now, this movie is totally streamlined for the new millennium, containing everything that would have been possible for the original flick, but such technologies were not available back in the day.I like this movie very much because Tim Allen takes center stage in this movie. I really miss "Home Improvement," because that was my favorite show ever, and Tim was the star of that show, too. Well, thanks to the "Santa Clause" sequels, "Christmas with the Kranks," and this movie, I can enjoy Tim all over again! I give this movie a 10, and people who see this will agree with me so much that they will think that this is good!</fullReview>

I do not even go and see the remakes except I recently watched the Pink Panther, and hated it, and this one, and I thought it was very funny and so new, not even following the original story or really being a remake, but a completely different story.

Though none of these updates/remakes are masterpieces, they do adequately modernize their respective originals, as does this one.The trained animals are great, and the CGI ones are as realistic as any I've seen, even WITH the mutations. This, of course, isn't as charming as the original, but we were a more innocent society then, and let's face it, Tim Allen is no Fred MacMurray.As a direct reflection of our society, this update bears a little scrutiny and forgiveness.It rates a 6.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was better than I thought it would. By no means was it great comedy, but it was entertaining for a kids film. I found myself laughing a few times because it was so silly. Tim Allen, plays, Dave, an assistant DA lawyer working on a case against a company testing on animals. He gets bitten by a dog that escaped from there, and it sends his life spinning out of control. He now turns into a dog, a shaggy sheepdog and as a human, is always using dog like traits, like growling, scratching, chasing cats.Being a dog helps him understand his kids more since they talk openly. He learns his son doesn't like football and wants to be on stage. And his daughter is worried about divorce. So, it brings the family closer. And Dave puts an end to Dr. Kozak's evil plan and saves the day.FINAL VERDICT: Silly, but entertaining for kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dave (Tim Allen) is being groomed for the job of District Attorney. This has made him unavailable to his family for several weeks. His daughter is becoming an environmental activist against a company Dave is working FOR and his son is hiding a secret dream to be a thespian, not a football star. His wife (Kristin Davis) just feels neglected. It turns out that the large pharmaceutical company Dave supports just may have something to hide, after all. Dave is bitten by an experimental dog his daughter has rescued from the plant and suddenly, Dave's hair is shaggy and he scratches behind the ears! All of this occurs at most inappropriate times, natch. Will Dave see the error of his ways at home and on the job? Or will his life go to the dogs? This cute movie is sure to please a family who wishes to sit down and enjoy a film together. Allen is funny as the man who has to experience life as a canine before he discovers what is really important. The supporting cast, including the wonderful Robert Downey, Jr., is very winning and the special effects are first rate. The sunny setting is pleasing and conducive to the upbeat manner of the movie. Yes, the first Shaggy Dog is a true classic and this one falls just short of this stature. But, when the family finishes viewing this new version, every member will have been giggled into a great and satisfying mood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Has this film come out in the US already? The original is definitely a 7/10 film and a remake has to be better because it doesn't use the superman special effects. If Disney had the technology back then then I would understand but they didn't. Then now have a new age and although Tim Allen is in the film which is a big turn off in the UK, it still should be far superior to the original. This is the start of a revolution of making old films, and if they don't re-do Digby the biggest dog in the world, then there is something wrong. Disney RULE the kids genre and anybody who decides otherwise is wrong in the head and doesn't appreciated films as they should be treated. PS. I will forgive you for not liking Around The World In 80 days, Steve Coogan is a comedic genius over here but that film is awful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame dog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the past, Disney, quality purveyor of family pet comedies, was in no danger of copping an easy jibe by including the word 'dog' in a movie title. That's all changed. It's been 30 years since the last Shaggy offering, and in this third outing Tim Allen (is he supposed to be funny?), Disney's regular dad, plays a deputy DA who's involved in a genetic engineering case. Allen is transformed into a sheep dog, then back to himself, and so on, at monotonously regular intervals, with consequences that will adequately pass the time for an easily amused 8 year old, but no-one else. I get the feeling this could have been a funny movie - perhaps without Mr Allen. There are plenty of clever ideas here, but they go thud in his uninspiring hands. The actors who play his kids aren't much better, and they aren't even cute! The cast includes Kristin Davis (Sex &amp; the City), Robert Downey Jnr, Danny Glover and Jane Curtin (3rd Rock From the Sun), but you get the feeling they've been deliberately restrained by a director who's determined no-one will laugh. Photography and production values are high, but the money has been squandered. Question: in the last 10 years, how many movie dads are workaholics who don't spend enough time with their kids? At last count, I believe it was 793. This movie makes it 794.</fullReview>

It seems that, what with Walt no longer running the famed Disney corporation movie makers all over are having a field day with ruining any sort-of reputation Disney might have made itself. This movie, like many other recent Disney releases, seems to be targeted towards kids but holds many scenes that are of more "adult" nature... Overall the movie has the usual make up for a mindless and pointless children's comedy, but fails horribly.

Even the seemingly funny parts immediately were followed by more of the same horrible, vomit-inducing lines, not to mention a plot that NEVER ENDS.

		<fullReview>I was a fan of the good ol' Disney versions, and this turned into a real letdown. Tim Allen made so many public comments on how he thought the originals could be improved, forsaking the fantasy element for a Sci-Fi element, and THIS is what he came up with? There were so many writers attached to this project over the years and it shows-this is a case of too many cooks spoiling the dog food.In the original movies where a magic ring caused him to turn into a dog, you could just sort of let logic go out the window and not question why he could still speak when he had a dog's vocal apparatus, hold a toothbrush without opposable thumbs, etc. But this movie takes a Sci-Fi approach where it happens because of genetic mutation-not to say it has to have the realism of a scientific documentary, we can still suspend disbelief in a family comedy...but can anyone answer these questions for me: 1) Why is it that all of the other animals in the lab only partially become dog-like...such as a snake having bushy dog fur at the end of its tail? And there are several other primates present that just take on dog behavior-why is it that Tim Allen's character takes on the dog behavior in his human form but then sporadically turns completely into a dog? MAJOR SPOILER HERE: And then why does Robert Downey Jr. only grow a tail when he gets infected? END MAJOR SPOILER 2)How it is that when he turns into the dog, his clothing just mysteriously slips off of him? I mean the guy is a hotshot attorney wearing buttoned-up business suits, are you telling me he goes from man-to-dog and there is not struggle? In the movie he doesn't even NOTICE it happens until after he has changed!!! 3) There is absolutely no resolution in the end...OK, perhaps they are waiting for a sequel,but what about his mutated dog genes? Does he have to go the rest of his life never knowing when he will turn into a dog? Again, if this were just a fantasy I would be able to suspend a great deal more disbelief. But Mr. Allen was so gung-ho about modernizing it and making it scientific; I say, for what?The Shaggy Dog and The Shaggy DA were both among the top-grossing movies for the years they were released and for good reason, they were just out to have fun. This movie focuses way to much on his relationship with his family and not enough on the easy sight-gags that made the first two so funny.Do you know that we never even SEE him transform into the dog...it always happens off-camera. What could POSSIBLY be more interesting than seeing the leading man turn into a dog (did co-producer Tim Allen arrange this so he would not have to spend hours in make-up)? Maybe we could ask the little kids I saw in the theatre struggling with boredom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I admit it, I like Disney films. I have been a Disaney fan since I was a kid ? and that's been a long while ago. How long? Well, let's just say that I remember sitting in my parents car at the drive-in-theater watching Fred MacMurry, Jean Hagen and Annette Funicello trying to help Tommy Kirk in the original "Walt Disney's ? The Shaggy Dog." I can remember laughing back then, and I can remember laughing when I again sat in a theater watching Dean Jones, Suzanne Pleshette and Tim Conway in Disney's "The Shaggy D.A." It was just as amusing, perhaps a bit repetitive in places, but ? hey ? it was a good film to laugh along with.Well, here I am again, sitting down to ponder Disney's latest version of The Shaggy Dog saga, and unfortunately, I am not laughing.Tim Allen does his best to bring this film up to the Disney standards set by MacMurry and Jones before him. However, even with his comedic genius, Allen is unable able to bring this film anywhere close to the original two Disney classics.Unlike the previous two Disney tales, this film revolves around a dog that is genetically mutated somehow, and is seemingly ageless. The "evil Dr. Kozak" and his henchmen from a sinister pharmaceutical company are out to extract a "fountain of youth" from this poor defenseless canine.What then follows is a cross between an "animal-rights activist promotional film" and a "Disney Imagineer's fantasy-run-amuck" ? which is at best, a film that does not hit the mark of a truly funny Disney Studio's comedy.Out of a possible 10-stars, this one only garners 2.Truly, this "sleeping dog" should have been left alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Allen slightly amusing in Disney dog remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we go with another remake of a film that wasn't all that great to begin with (see "Yours, Mine &amp; Ours" "The Fog," and "The Hills Have Eyes" as recent examples). Original was released in 1959 and starred Fred MacMurrary and Tommy Kirk, among others, and wasn't the high mark of Disney entertainment, although it was not that bad.Competently directed by Brian Robbins (TV series "One Tree Hill"), this new version features Tim Allen ("Christmas With The Kranks") as a Los Angeles district attorney, Dave Douglas, trying to climb the corporate ladder ? while ignoring his lovely wife, Rebecca (Kristin Davis, "Shark Boy &amp; Lava Girl," the TV series "Sex and the City"), and two cute kids, Carly (Zena Grey, "In Good Company") and Josh (Spencer Breslin, "Cat in the Hat").Dave is prosecuting Carly's teacher, who is accused of firebombing a local chemical company because they experiment on animals (fun family plot, so far), but, in a zany mix-up, the lawyer is bitten by a 300-year-old Tibetan sheepdog (although some sources identify this breed as a bearded collie).This causes the special effects to go into high gear, as he grows a floppy tongue, super sensitive hearing and the ability to run on all fours before finally turning into a sheepdog (or bearded collie) himself.Thank goodness he communicates through inner dialogue, though, and not the creepy animated animal mouth movements. His effort to relate his new form to his family is also rather amusing (as they think he has left them), using a Scrabble game to spell out his dilemma and finding out his son would rather be in "Grease" than play football.Meanwhile, (as a pup) finds out that corporate hack, Dr. Kozak (Robert Downey, Jr.) is indeed using animals to develop a fountain of youth drug. The effects are lacking somewhat when we see the beasts (a ridiculous dog-frog and cobra-canine mutations, as well as rabbits, monkeys and rats that bark), which are as silly as those featured in one of the worst films of 2005, "A Sound Of Thunder."Kids will like this, and adults will not be too put off, either, but you'd probably be better off to rent or buy the original, for its better acting, more interesting storyline and absence of Tim Allen.</fullReview>
