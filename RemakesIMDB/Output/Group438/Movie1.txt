		<shortDescription>Delightful Disney Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shaggy Dog" is a delightful live-action comedy, the first of many to emerge from the Walt Disney Studios during the late 50s - through the early 80s. Although firmly rooted in the late 1950s the film has many charms, mosty noticeably its innocence, pure situation comedy and perfect pitch performances by a cast of film veterans. Is the film a classic - no. Is it worth watching, by all means. It's a wonderfully entertaining Disney family film and it holds up quite well, even for today's jaded audiences. If you can't find the appeal in this film well, then your mature beyond all hope. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tommy Kirk Going To The Dogs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There seems to be some confusion about exactly what place in film history The Shaggy Dog has. First and foremost it is not Walt Disney's first live action film, but it is the first live action big screen comedy that he did. It is also the first film that Disney did with Fred MacMurray starring.For MacMurray this was a big film. His career was in the doldrums at that point and this film brought him to his final phase of his career as the star of family oriented comedies. He got a television series, My Three Sons, after this and that together with the Disney films kept him steadily working for the next fifteen years.Though MacMurray is the star along with Jean Hagen as his wife, the film's title role is played in part by Tommy Kirk. Kirk is a young teenager with a lot of angst and an abiding interest in the space program. So much so he constructs his own rocket in his basement and it has an unscheduled launch to open the film. A generation later, this bit was copied in Family Matters by Steve Urkel.Anyway he's got a healthy set of hormones as well and a rivalry with the smooth talking Tim Considine down the street. Both are hot to trot for Annette Funicello, but when Roberta Shore shows up with father Alexander Scourby, both go after her as well.Roberta's the only weakness in the film. For someone who is foreign, she has one cheesy accent and at times just drops it altogether. She's also got a large shaggy dog named Chiffon.Anyway while at a museum young Mr. Kirk gets a hold of an enchanted ring and repeats a spell that causes him to enter the body of the neighbor's shaggy dog. And he discovers that in fact Scourby and his confederates are spies. What follows after as Kirk periodically changes from talking dog to teenager is still pretty hilarious. Fred MacMurray gets a lot of laughs as the man who gets the credit for exposing the spy ring which son Kirk can't really claim.James Westerfield, one delightful character actor in everything he does, makes the first of three appearances as Officer Hanson, the much put upon patrol cop in this, The Absent Minded Professor and Son of Flubber. Best moment in the film is when Kirk as The Shaggy Dog steals Westerfield's police vehicle in pursuit of the villains.I'm still amazed at how well the ancient special effects still work in this film. Disney took some meticulous care in doing the scenes with the dog. You really do think The Shaggy Dog is driving those vehicles and not some guy dressed in a dog costume. Good thing it was a large Shaggy Dog though, a Chihuahua would not have worked as well.Still working well today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Funny show about a boy who turns into a dog after coming under an ancient spell. This, of course, leads to all sorts of trouble and adventures. Fred McMurray played the part of the put upon dad to perfection, he had me rolling in the floor. Also, the cops who couldn't quite believe their eyes tickled my funnybone, and they put on quite a show with their comical car chase. Silly Disney stuff to be sure, but lots of fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a classic Disney film. Fred MacMurray and others make this a joy to watch. I have seen it several times and always enjoy it...my children even agree with me on this. Contrary to another comment, I believe it has held up very well over the years, though it is dated by virtue of the fact that it reflects the comedy of the period in which it was filmed. I've seen several of the remakes/sequels and none have equalled the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit more context</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Up to the point of this movie, the Disney Studio had had plenty of experience in live-action film production, but it was chiefly in the UK, where they used the considerable debt-credit that England had run up during the war years to produce things as Treasue Island and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. Their initial foray into U.S. live-action production was Davy Crockett on Disneyland, the Mickey Mouse Club's TV serials, and then Zorro, followed by several mini-series on Walt Disney Presents (Texas John Slaughter, Elfego Baca, Swamp Fox). The Shaggy Dog was initially planned as a TV series to follow Zorro as something independent from the weekly Disney hour. You can see vestiges of TV production in almost every aspect of this film, from the post-production foley work on entire scenes to the subdued performance of Kirk (largely reprising his Joe Hardy role from the Hardy Boys serials) and MacMurray's scenery chewing. Not that either of these things were unusual in family movies of the time, but we tend to be more forgiving of them on old TV. (The book the concept originated in was written by Felix Salten, who created Bambi and Perri, a couple of Disney animal characters who did pretty well for themselves.) The Shaggy Dog was one of the first movies I saw as a child and I've always held a great affection for it, even while recognizing all of its flaws. The concept here is what I liked, and I believe, had the same cast (remember, this is the year before Fred MacMurray and Tim Considine were cast in My Three Sons) starred in a TV series based on the concept, we'd now be looking back fondly on another TV classic of the golden years rather than a rather middling Disney comedy. I still feel that it might work better as a Disney Channel series than a movie starring Tim Allen; part of the reason I liked the original is because the star was a kid only a couple of years older than me. What I don't need in a new Shaggy Dog film is even PG humor, and without it these days, there isn't much of a market for it in theaters (or even as a series on any of the major networks). It's a kids' super-hero concept that requires a kids' venue, and, sadly, that isn't the big screen. Perhaps, however, if the film does well, someone in the studio will realize that it would work better on a weekly basis...about fifty years late.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was NOT Disney's first live-action feature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "Wild &amp; Woolly" DVD edition of 1959's THE SHAGGY DOG (and some product reviews and posts found here) claim this film is the "first live action movie ever produced by Walt Disney!" I guess all those other live action features Walt produced PRIOR to THE SHAGGY DOG (such as 1957's OLD YELLER or 1954's Academy Award-winning 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA, among others) didn't count? (One comment posted here stated that 20,000 LEAGUES, like TREASURE ISLAND, was one of the films done for Disney in England because of studio funds tied up there. Not true; when not filming on location, 20,000 LEAGUES was shot on the sound stages at the Disney Studio in California...information supplied to me by the studio while I was researching &amp; writing a magazine article on the making of the film.) I can see how some reviewers might make such a mistake, but for the claim to appear on the packaging that was approved by the Disney staff takes some serious explaining. (As does the differences in running time for the two versions of the film, with the B&amp;W version being the full cut of the movie, while the colorized version is missing about 10 minutes of material.) Don't get me wrong,this is a great comedy and well worth having...it just deserved a bit better treatment for its fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is increasingly difficult to find movies that are suitable for children, both for their entertainment value and their lack of inappropriate content. The Shaggy Dog is a thoughtful story that the whole family can enjoy. The plot is complex enough to hold the interest of the oldest members of the family while not being too involved or frightening for the youngest children. You're also able to walk away from this movie without having to rationalize to your children why foul language was used, nor do you have to worry about the modern tendency of Disney movies to try to sexualize children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>imaginative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a while since I saw this film; I last saw it when I was probably about 10-years-old. The film was about a boy who turns into a dog time and time again and the adventures that he had trying to avoid being turned into a dog. I cannot comment about the production of this film or anything as it has been too long ago, but I did like the story through my eyes (as a child). The film actually reminded me of one of my favourite childhood books: "Woof!" by Allan Ahlberg. Again, this film is about a boy who keeps changing into a dog, and it is about his adventures and about him trying to prevent turning into a dog. This is an imaginative children's film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shaggy Dog- It's A Dog's Life **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fred MacMurray and Jean Hagen starred in this 1959 film. Miss Hagen was given very little to do here. Ironically, about 15 years after this film, both MacMurray and Hagen were diagnosed with throat cancer. He survived,dying from pneumonia years later. She succumbed 2 years later, in 1977, at age 54.This lighthearted film deals with MacMurray being afraid of dogs only to have his son fall victim to a Borgia curse and turn into a dog at times. Naturally, there is the new girl next door whose father leads a spy ring. Our son turned dog hears all about their plots and the rest of the film is devoted to MacMurray not being believed by police that his son has turned into a dog. There is the usual wily car chase but this time a dog is at the wheel.A typical Disney film without the usual fanfare. That's probably because the film is in black and white.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bow! Wow!... It's A Doggy-Delight!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I'll be dog-gone! It was my sweet, little, 8 year-old nephew, Dexter, who excitedly picked out THE SHAGGY DOG (1959) at the local video store for the 2 of us to watch together.... And, you know what? I'm glad he did.Regardless of its gaping plot-holes and its laughably cheap make-up effects, THE SHAGGY DOG's script was definitely first-rate, fast-paced, and, generally, a lot of goofy, family-oriented fun-fun-fun.Packed with plenty of hilarious one-liners, slapstick chases, and uproarious sight gags, THE SHAGGY DOG also featured an excellent cast who competently brought this 1950s Comedy right in on the mark.THE SHAGGY DOG's story centers around the zany experiences of a white, suburban, teen named Wilby Daniels (a bona-fide geek) who, always at a loss for words around the girls, suddenly finds himself in a very hairy situation when the unknown powers of an antique "magical" ring transforms him into an Old English sheepdog. (You go figure) Check it out. You'll be dog-gone glad that you did.Arf! Arf! This original version of THE SHAGGY DOG was far superior to the 2006 remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shaggy dog many years later, a remembrance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember being taken to this movie when I was 8 or 9 years old. I was accompanied by my mother and my aunt. I remember being appalled at their reaction. They were nearly rolling in the aisles. I was unimpressed knowing that a child could not be turned into a dog and found the whole thing silly. I have not seen the movie since then. But I guess I might enjoy it these days for it's silliness. My mother and I did not see a movie again until I took her to see "2001" in 1968. She was impressed and correctly predicted, beforehand, there would be Howard Johnson's at the space station. Sorry for the unrelated memories that have nothing to do with this movie. But I cannot help but relate that 7 years later I took her to see "Blazing Saddles", fearful that she might be offended by some of the off color jokes. She laughed wholeheartedly at all the dirty jokes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird and Funny "Shaggy Dog" Story Of Teen Age Lycanthropy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is a hoot for anyone who understands the term " a shaggy dog story" or anyone who knows folklore. first off the term "shaggy dog", means a ridiculous or exaggerated story so even the title is imaginative and clever. anyone who has delved into folklore knows all about stories of lycanthropy or the legend of the Borgia family. all of this mixed into the whole fifties "i was a teen age..." formula. the film is good laughs and not a bad excursion into contemporary folklore.i've always felt that Disney comedies like this are often underrated for their cleverness. i guess because so much of the comedy is played for dumb laughs it's hard to take it all seriously, which you're not supposed to really, because it's Disney you're supposed to enjoy and have fun.this is a great comedy, semi-horror, teen flick that actually holds up well to sophisticated screw ball comedies. a genuine argument can be made for this film that it is one of cinema's better comedies. certainly with all of it's gimmicks and effects, it's very cinematic.one major note here for viewers. this film was originally filmed in glorious B&amp;W and is most effective when viewed in B&amp;W. avoid the horrible colorized, tinted versions which disarm the effectiveness of it's nostalgia and photography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Cures Wilby??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught this film on Turner Classic Movies one Sundy morning. I almost NEVER watch Disney movies but for some reason ended up sitting through the whole flick. More enjoyable than most Disney movies I must say. I saw plenty as a youth and and there's one thing I'll always remember. As much as I wanted to see the films, I was always disappointed because all of the best/funny parts were already in the promotional TV ads which made the theater viewings redundant. Anyway, throughout the entire movie, after his exposure to a magic ring, Wilby turns into the Shaggy Dog and back without warning several more times. Every time this happens, the real shaggy dog disappears from wherever he is as the Dilby transformation takes palace. By the end of the movie though, Dilby seems to have been cured of this Jeckll &amp; Hyde routine, What did I miss? What cured him? It went right over my head!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly comedy is dated stuff that looks more like a made-for-TV movie than a feature length hit...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Times have certainly changed. Here we have a Disney live action feature film that looks and sounds more like a TV sit-com (and a below par one at that), and yet it grossed $8,000,000 at the box-office at a time when any film that grossed more than a few million was considered a box-office hit.At least FRED MacMURRAY does a professional job as the bumbling father of TOMMY KIRK and KEVIN CORCORAN, a dog-hater with a shotgun who gets itchy around the collar if a dog is even remotely close to his territory. He provides some genuine chuckles with his comic touch on a role that could well have seemed anything but sympathetic. The boys do OK too, especially Kevin Corcoran as the younger brother who always wanted a dog and promises to take good care of his brother who has magically transformed into one.The plot is pretty threadbare but it does provide some very amusing moments--such as the one where Tommy Kirk gets into his pajamas and brushes his teeth while in the guise of the shaggy dog. The transmutation has taken place because he read aloud the inscription on a ring that had once belonged to the Borgias and whose Latin words were meant to change the sayer into a dog.What weakens the story is the whole spy subplot which has him overhearing the spies while a dog and then reverting to his own body before he can get away from their presence. All of this leads to a hectic chase that has the baffled police force falling all over themselves to catch a shaggy dog driving a stolen police car.It's silly stuff and never overcomes the feel of a lame sitcom from the innocent '50s, complete with people like ANNETTE FUNICELLO, TIM CONSIDINE, JEAN HAGEN (a far cry from her "Singin' in the Rain" dumb blonde), and JAMES WESTERFIELD as the policeman who can't believe his own eyes.It passes the time pleasantly enough but you have to be willing to view it in the context of its '50s era innocence.And contrary to what some here believe, this was not Disney's first live action film--not by a long shot. However, it was one of the few to make a bundle at the box-office for some unknown reason and gave a boost to the sagging career of Fred MacMurray at a time when his film career was on the skids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After years of strictly animated features, this is the first live action feature from Disney and it is still a delight even 44 years after it was first released. Fred MacMurray shows what a great comedic talent he was after years of playing primarily dramatic roles. He shows in this film a preview of what was to be expected when he started the show that became his trademark, "My Three Sons". Also, Tommy Kirk, Tim Considine and Kevin Corcoran all were great in this film. This is still a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Postman Wilson Daniels (Fred MacMurray) hates dogs and is allergic to them. His son Wilby is entranced by the new French girl Franceska Andrassy. She invites him to her home. She has shaggy sheepdog and from a painting, the family seems to have a shaggy dog for a long time. He stumble into a room and accidentally takes a ring. After reading the inscription, he finds himself turning into a shaggy dog from time to time. His slick friend Buzz Miller asks out both Allison D'Allessio (Annette Funicello) and Francesca to the dance. To solve the problem, Buzz gets Wilby to come along and lie to both girls. Just when things couldn't be more complicated, Wilby as a dog overhears a plan to steal military secret.This is a cute Disney family movie. It's got plenty of clean cut fun. Who doesn't like a dog in pajamas? It's nothing too hilarious. It's a light-weight comedy. There is a serious espionage story that doesn't really fit the tone. It is still funny at times but the darker material does take its toll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This is the shaggy dog story."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the opening titles, we see a view of 1950s suburb United States. Afterwards we see Wilson Daniels (Fred MacMurray) yelling at a dog to get off his lawn. A narrator tells us that Wilson loves his fellow man, but despises man's best friend the dog (mostly because he's a postman). But Wilson's oldest son Wilby Daniels (Tommy Kirk) inadvertently turns into a dog and has to uncover a group of spies who are planning to steal a missile. If that story line makes no sense, that's because it was written down. Trust me the story is a lot better when you watch the movie. Even though it may not make any sense when you read my review it will when you watch it. The acting is also good. MacMurray plays the average American everyman and does a really good job with it. When all these strange things happen to Wilson, he pretty much goes along with it. Most of the runtime is actually spent on Wilby, because he's the person that actually turns into the dog. So Wilby sees all these things that Wilson is pretty much oblivious too for the majority if the film. Even at the end when Wilson is being hailed as a hero he still doesn't really know what jut happened to him. The rest of the cast also turned in a great performance. I highly recommend this movie. It's available on DVD and VHS so if you can find a copy check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's another flick from the past that I actually saw in the theater during it's initial run back in 1959. My Mom and Dad would take me to the movies as a kid and it was usually a Disney picture like this one. Watching them today is a little weird because they don't have that same magical quality unless you're with someone of the same age I was back then. That's why I bring my granddaughter over for company when tuning in to these old time films.The story's a blast for youngsters. Watching young Tommy Kirk turn into a Brataslavian Sheep Dog is a highlight of the picture and he gets to do it a number of times. The tale borrows from ancient fables of shape-shifting creatures and black magic, with a little bit of Lucretia Borgia thrown in for good measure. But you know, there might have been something to all that magical stuff - right after Franceska (Roberta Shore) cleans the cut above Buzz Miller's (Tim Considine) eye, all trace of the cut disappears!What's kind of interesting are those scenes of the Shaggy Dog driving Buzz's roadster and later on the police car. The Disney folks figured out a way to make it look like a dog was really driving the car, wagging tongue and all. Not too much of a problem today of course, but this was over fifty years ago and the special effects department did a pretty good job.For Annette Funicello, this was her first feature film, and even though she's not a principal, she still has a fair amount of screen time. Not to belabor the point, but it was cool way back when to see one of the Mousketeers make it to the big screen. This was also about the time I started becoming familiar with the names of the actors and actresses in the movies I saw. I happen to recall both Bob Hope and Bing Crosby being asked in separate interviews who they thought the richest person in Hollywood was. Without batting an eye or needing time to think about it, they both answered with the same name - Fred MacMurray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inventive family farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shaggy Dog is an inventive family farce from the folks at Disney's live action unit. It plays more like a radio or television sitcom than as classic Hollywood cinema. The lead actors are appealing: Fred MacMurray is charming, even in one of his least sympathetic father roles; Jean Hagen is the sensible wife who maintains order; Disney teen idol Tommy Kirk is the troubled son; there are a bevy of other child actors and of course, one mustn't forget the sheepdog that causes most of the pandemonium.Not to spoil the plot and tell you how the animal comes to cause so much chaos, but the poster advertising the film does indicate there is a scene where the dog drives a sports car while chasing after Russian spies. This is heightened for laughs, and I must say that the premise allows for great sight gags, like the kind that might be found in a Harold Lloyd or Marx Brothers film. It is obvious the writers have used their imaginations and have brought a very visual comedy to the screen.</fullReview>

When it turns out that the relative of the attractive new girl in town is really a spy, Wilby's trans-formative ability proves to be most handy at stopping him from stealing state secrets.

		<fullReview>A flat fantasy that plods along at an insufferably slow pace before sparking into life right at the end, when it's far too late. Tommy Kirk is a kid who finds a magic ring that transforms him into a talking dog; in this furry form he overhears crooks planning a robbery at the local missile plant. If it sounds like one of those daft, seemingly drug-induced Disney capers that inevitably ends in a car chase, that's because it is. Unfortunately it's not much fun bar the hilarious animated credits sequence and odd moment like the dog putting on pajamas, cleaning his teeth and driving a car. It's not enough. Despite the utter stupidity of the film's plot this is stiff, boring and woodenly acted stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shaggy dog tail of a film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the last few days,I've been in the mood of watching a fun family film.As I went looking at my DVDs,I spotted a film that my dad had given to me a while ago with Fred MacMurray-who I hugely enjoyed seeing in the excellent Absent-Minded Professor starring in.The plot:After having gotten back from being left behind at a local museum by his "best friend" and a new next door neighbour (who he secretly has a crush on)Wilby Daniels discovers that a strange looking ancient ring has ended up in one of his jean pockets.When he reads out the inscription on the ring,he turns into his neighbours dog!!.Due to his father saying that he will shoot any dog that comes into the house (this is because he had a lot of trouble with dogs when he was a postman.)Because of this,Wilby decides to stay with the newly-arrived neighbours.Whilst there,Daniels discovers that the neighbours are not as sweet as they seem...View on the film:Whilst the last half an hour of the film has a very entertaining Mad Mad Mad Mad World-style chase,an odd thing about the screenplay by Bill Walsh and Lillie Hayward,is that they offer no explanation as to how the neighbours dog returns when Wilby turns back into a human.Also,perhaps due to the films age,the ending (where Wilby seems pretty happy to hear that the girl he had a crush on is being sent back and questioned by the CIA!.) gives the movie's ending a surprisingly nasty taste.Although he is not given as bigger role as I would have liked,Fred MacMurray gives a good performance as Wilson Daniels,who has trouble dealing with all the crazy chaos around him.Tommy Kirk also gives a very strong performance as Wilby,by showing all the frustrations that he has to try and manage,because of his transformation.Final view on the film:A fun film for the whole family,with very good performances from MacMurray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really funny and entertaining late 50's Disney live action classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cranky mailman Wilson Daniels (a delightfully charming portrayal by Fred MacMurray) has a vehement disdain for dogs. Things get hairy (both literally and figuratively) when his likable misfit son Wilby (a wonderfully amiable performance by Tommy Kirk) gets stricken by a magical ring that causes him to transform into a big shaggy sheepdog. Wilby has to perform an act of heroism by thwarting an international spy ring so he can break the spell. Director Charles Bartun, working from a witty and good-natured script by Bill Walsh and Lillie Haward, relates the zany plot at a constant zippy pace, maintains a pleasant and frothy tone throughout, and stages the slapstick gags with praiseworthy brio (amusing comic highlights include the dog disrupting a swanky dance party, a hapless patrolman's sidesplitting constant run-ins with the talking pooch, and a marvelously wacky last reel car chase). Moreover, the characters are well-developed, sympathetic, and above all even pretty believable as everyday folks who find themselves caught up in a fantastic situation. Extra kudos are in order for the uniformly sound acting from a tip-top cast: MacMurray and Kirk shine in the lead roles, with fine support from Jean Hagen as Wilson's doting wife Freeda, Kevin Corcoran as Wilby's mischievous little squirt kid brother Moochie, Tim Considine as Wilby's hip pal Buzz Miller, Roberta Shore as fetching French hottie Franceska Andrassy, Annette Funicello as the sweet and adorable Allison D'Allessio, Cecil Kellaway as the jolly Professor Plumcutt, and Strother Martin as no-count criminal Thurm. Sam the dog is simply amazing as the titular canine. Legendary voice actor Paul Frees provides the narration and even has an uncredited minor part as disbelieving psychiatrist Dr. J.W. Galvin. The theme song is an absolute groovy gas. Edward Colman's crisp black and white cinematography makes neat occasional use of fades and dissolves. Endearing family fare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>sure,it may seem cheesy by todays' standards,but it's good clean fun for the whole family,for the most part.really young children might be a bit scared from a few scenes,but other than that,it's fun for everyone.i chuckled quite a bit t some of the comedic bits,and i also thought the story was interesting.it's not just about the Shaggy Dog.there's another story in there as well.some of the facial expressions and reactions may seem a bit hokey and overdone,but so what.that was how they acted back then. if i recall correctly,this was the first motion picture made by Disney.i wouldn't say the comedic parts are laugh out loud,rolling in the aisles funny.,but they were certainly amusing.you could do a lot worse with 102 minutes or so.my vote for The Shaggy Dog: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming Young Performers Make This Dog Hunt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tommy Kirk is a typical teenager (Wilby) who gets an ancient ring caught in his trouser cuff. The magical jewel turns him into an on-again/off-again shaggy dog. Mr. Kirk's father Fred MacMurray (Mr. Wilson) hates dogs; little brother Kevin Corcoran (Moochie) loves them.This is a Walt Disney movie for kids; and, it's one to try to enjoy without asking a lot of questions about a very weak plot. The idea is fun, and the "special effect" might have looked very good to young 1959 eyes. Today, it's a movie to watch for the young performances. Kirk is very good as Wilby, effectively giving "The Shaggy Dog" a voice; he is charming. Tim Considine and Kevin Corcoran are likewise charmers as Kirk's pal and kid brother. Mr. Considine (as Buzz) has a terrific scene to watch for - look for his performance as he tries to put "the make" on fetching neighbor Roberta Shore, on her couch, with rival Wilby watching in dog form! Also, watch for the always charming Annette Funicello, delightfully bracketing the film as Buzz' sometimes steady. ***** The Shaggy Dog (3/19/59) Charles Barton ~ Fred MacMurray, Tommy Kirk, Tim Considine, Kevin Corcoran</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>definitely the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first live action comedy movie Disney did and it's great. Cute premise of boy turning into sheepdog and defeating nest of spies. Lots of slapstick and funny situations. The entire cast is first rate. It also has leisurely pacing that really is interesting,Disney hadn't quite got to the era where all the comedy is whacked on the head full center and nothing left to the imagination. I recommend the DVD very much,it has both color and black and white versions of the film plus commentaries from the cast that are very interesting with background of the making of the film. It's also interesting to see how much the cast changed. Hard to believe this movie is 44 years old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming and amusing entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I re-watched this film as I often do with my childhood favourites. I loved The Shaggy Dog as a child, and at 18 I still do. But I wasn't so taken with the spy subplot, thinking it went on for too long and took up too much time in the narrative. Also, the film feels a little too long.However, despite how silly some of it it never fails to be amusing and charming, which is more than good enough for me. The film's production values are decent and hold up fairly well, while Paul J.Smith's score is jaunty and dynamic. The script is snappy as well and the story doesn't fall into the trap of being too predictable complete with a number of very entertaining scenes especially the pursuit in the police car, hectic it may be but also entertaining.The direction is pretty good too, as is the acting. Fred MacMurray is likable with some fun acting chops, while Jean Hagen shows some great comic timing. The real star though is Tommy Kirk, who is just great here. All in all, a fun, charming and amusing movie. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An early live action Disney movie with its share of flaws, but also plenty of heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw lots of Disney animated films from different eras as a kid, back in the '90s, but never heard of this particular live action flick from Walt Disney Productions. I remember when the remake starring Tim Allen came out in 2006 and I saw a trailer for it, but I didn't know that film was a remake at the time. I still haven't seen that version, and have known for sometime now that it's not all that popular, but now I have finally seen the original 1959 version of "The Shaggy Dog", with a cast featuring Fred MacMurray and several cast members of "The Mickey Mouse Club". I didn't think this movie would be amazing family entertainment, since it doesn't seem to have that kind of reputation, but I was expecting it to be a 7/10 for me, which it is.Wilby Daniels is a teenager who likes to conduct experiments in the basement, but his father, Wilson, does not like this, and after Wilby accidentally launches a missile from the basement, Wilson tells him to clear out all his experiments. A new family moves into the neighbourhood, and Wilby and his friend, Buzz Miller, soon meet the daughter of the family, Franceska Andrassy. They also meet the family's sheep dog. Wilby, Buzz, and Franceska go to the museum together, but Wilby is separated from the other two. He meets Professor Plumcutt, a man he used to know, who tells him about his beliefs in ancient magic, including shape-shifting. Wilby ends up accidentally bringing home a mystical ring, which turns him into the Andrassy dog! This is not a good thing, since his father hates dogs! He sneaks out to tell Plumcutt what has happened, and learns from him that he is now under a spell, which will turn him back and forth from human to dog, and the only way to break this spell is through a selfless act of heroism! As a comedy, this 1959 live action Disney flick is far from consistent, but I did laugh a number of times, starting around the beginning when Wilby has his missile in the basement and accidentally launches it from there, obviously putting holes in every floor above! More laughs come after Wilby turns into a dog, including the scenes where Officer Hanson hears the teenager talk to him while in dog form. I didn't usually laugh that hard, but those parts were definitely exceptions, and were not the only ones! The acting in "The Shaggy Dog" is mostly not that impressive, and the plot isn't the most interesting, but in both cases, I've certainly seen worse. The dance sequence is maybe a bit tedious, and during parts like that, it was somewhat of a struggle for me to stay into it, but eventually, that changed, as the story gets better and the suspense builds up! For the rest of the film, I had no trouble staying into it, even if it wears out its welcome just a BIT towards the end. So, while by no means a masterpiece, this original "Shaggy Dog" probably still has enough to please the family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bow-wow-whoa!!!!! (the 1959 review)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney's first version of "The Shaggy Dog" had come to us from the year of 1959, the year that had brought us "Sleeping Beauty," "Darby O'Gill and the Little People," plus the television shows that were still running and more!!!!! In this B&amp;W funny movie, a boy goes into a basement and uses magic to transform into a big, hairy dog!!!!! Many things happen, like the dog driving a car, and more!!!!!What I like about this movie: It's cute. I've seen this and the 1994 remake. The '94 version I've seen on ABC; this version I've seen on the Hallmark Channel, the new home for most of the Disney Classics!!!!! Yes, this film may show its age, but it's still so enjoyable because it's yet another dog movie!!!!!"The Shaggy Dog" - woof!!!!!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing.....and mediocre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fairly amusing and painless, but also dated and long Disney comedy. I think it would've been better if it had stuck with the main theme and tried to earn more laughs out of it, instead of getting sidetracked by too many uninteresting subplots (they should have gotten rid of all that spy stuff). Best thing in the picture? A charming Annette Funicello. (**1/2)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bow! Wow!... It's A Doggy Delight!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I'll be dog-gone.It was my sweet, little, 8 year-old nephew, TeddyBear, who excitedly picked out The Shaggy Dog at the local video store for the two of us to watch together.... And, you know what? I'm glad he did.Regardless of its gaping plot holes and its laughably cheap make-up effects, The Shaggy Dog's script was definitely first-rate, fast-paced, and, generally, a lot of goofy, family-oriented fun-fun-fun.Packed with plenty of hilarious one-liners, slapstick chases and uproarious sight gags, The Shaggy Dog also featured an excellent cast who competently brought this 1950s Comedy right in on the mark.The Shaggy Dog's story centers around the zany experiences of white, suburban teen, Wilby Daniels (a bona-fide geek) who, always at a loss for words around the girls, suddenly finds himself in a very hairy situation when the unknown powers of an antique "magical" ring transforms him into (of all things) an Old English Sheepdog. (You go figure) Check it out. You'll be dog-gone glad that you did.... Arf! Arf!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did Tommy Kirk and Annette Funicello ever star in anything except these kinds of movies?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave "The Shaggy Dog" 5/10 because it's the sort of movie that you find really cool at a young age, but it makes you roll your eyes as you get older. Some friends of ours had it on VHS, and I was surprised to later find out that the movie was originally black-and-white, and that their version was colorized.Now that I look back on it, I realize that the movie brings up some interesting questions. If a successful suburban family man owns a gun, shouldn't he have a better excuse for owning it than just to shoot dogs? If there's a woman with a continental European accent, shouldn't she be played by someone from whichever country it is? Did Tommy Kirk and Annette Funicello ever star in anything except these kinds of movies? Well, let's talk about that. I know that they went on to do beach movies. He starred in "The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini" (justifiable only because it stars Boris Karloff) and "Catalina Caper" (with which I'm familiar only because "Mystery Science Theater 3000" showed it; naturally, they couldn't resist making a "Gilligan's Island"-related comment) and later disappeared. She of course was a Mouseketeer and later was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, the same affliction that eventually killed Richard Pryor.How do you like that? I'm reviewing a Disney movie and I mention Boris Karloff, "MST3K", "Gilligan's Island", and Richard Pryor. But I take pride in that. Anyway, "Cujo" is a much neater dog-themed movie, at least now that I'm old enough to determine such things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shabby 'Dog'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tommy Kirk is half-asleep on-screen, murmuring his lines and blinking his heavy lids like a teenager on Valium. Casting him at the center of "The Shaggy Dog" wasn't just a mistake, it was sabotage. Fred MacMurray, as a shotgun wielding dog-hater, isn't much better, and his bellowing is tiresome, sometimes downright ugly. Walt Disney's first slapstick-in-suburbia live-action comedy was obviously targeted at restless kids, easy laughers who just needed something visually funny to sustain their interest. Today however, "The Shaggy Dog" looks and feels extremely cheap. The direction is dull and unimaginative, and the special effects (a dog talking with Kirk's voice) consist mainly of a pooch filmed chewing his food with a voice-over. It was inexplicably popular. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Disney Occult Promotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has a nostalgic cast for those of us who were kids in the 1950s. Here are those straight-laced kids from "The Mickey Mouse Club:" Tommy Kirk, Tim Considine and Annette Funicello. Kevin Corcoran, another good child actor, is in here, too along with adults Fred MacMurray and Jean Hagen.Despite those good things, the typical pro-occult story is here again, this time in spades. It's amazing the number of Walt Disney movies in which the occult is the main theme - and always shown to be something to be believed! In this case, the Borgia family is lionized and the "theology" - get this - is that humans can be turned into animals. If this was presented as strictly a gag, I'd understand, but it's taken as "fact" here!!!</fullReview>
