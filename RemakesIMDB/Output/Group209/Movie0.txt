		<fullReview>'People forget the unpleasant things. They only remember what they want to remember.'In Rashomon the editing tells ? of the story. It may feel experimental or unconventional, but Kurosawa perfects the concept second by second, directing and editing. This film didn't need a big budget to come perfectly to the point. It's a simple tale, but not a superficial tale. Different points of view and selective memories ('It's true! I saw it!') don't only make the woods unsafe, but are one of the most universal topics of humanity. 'We humans are weak creatures. That's why we lie, even to ourselves' says it all actually: it's about what people want to hear and when they start being interested at all, apart from wishful thinking. Selfish excuses vs trust in other people.Rashomon gets masterful when in one instant there is literally a different point of view: the camera takes another position to shoot the same sequence, thereby forcing the audience to reconsider what they just saw. That is the sort of storytelling that the supposed masters of cinema in our time yet have to equal, or try to copy when they fail. Admitted 'Memento' (2000, Nolan) is a truly great one. Still not THAT universal. 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) didn't come close, 'La Commare Secca' (1962) also didn't. 'Ghost dog: the way of the samurai' (1999) touched another border of the concept, or does it?The use of (non-original) music in my opinion reveals a certain interest for western influence, not only in Rashomon, but also in Kurosawa's forthcoming films, and is probably why his films were so influential on western filmmakers too.The cinematography is dynamic and changes scene by scene to emphasize exactly what is going on. The shadows of leaves and branches, captured by cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa, make you really feel 'in the woods', while the actors (Toshirô Mifune, Takashi Shimura) convince the remaining part of the audience (which adds up to 100% breathless viewers). It may be after days that you first realize you saw an important film. After weeks you realize that you must see it again to comprehend (despite it's only 85 min), and ironically that is just one of the crucial points that Kurosawa made. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kurosawa's first milestone, one of the top foreign films of the 20th century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa was one of those directors, the first from the Eastern hemisphere, to develop the form and structure of cinema in ways it hadn't been. The story he used for Rashomon is now, like Seven Samurai, Hidden Fortress, and Yojimbo, a near archetype that at this point in the history of film has become formula and common knowledge for writers and directors. In that sense, Rashomon is as important and entertaining as a film as Citizen Kane, Battleship Potemkin, Rear Window, or Open City. Tee basic premise- Four different people give four different accounts on the rape and murder of a couple in the woods. A key ingredient to the success of Rashomon, is that the recollections given to the courts by the woman, the bandit, the as well as the four in discussion, is that their emotions reveal their humanity, even if their details reveal nothing, or everything. It's difficult to say whether character goes over story here, or if they have equal importance to understand Kurosawa's psychology with these people. The opening shot of the house is a perfect representation of the mature of the picture, something that has fallen apart over time due to disasters that go beyond control of individuals. The man who heard the testimonies of the trial says "I don't understand". This has been a discussed line, since essentially he's saying the point right up front. All the information won't ease his puzzlement. The three who discuss the details of the crimes and confessions are crucial- they speak for us, what our opinions might be, and we listen to each version of the story, the characters, the fears, the pride, the shame, and the search for judgment and/or truth in the situation.Along with being director and co-adapter, Kurosawa's mastery is revealed heavily in his use of editing- there are short, fleeting moments that hint, or rather pronounce, emotions and thoughts. For instance, when we first see Tajomaru, the bandit, played by action-legend Toshiro Mifune, he is looking up at the sky, bound in straps to keep him from moving, and for a second, or less than a second, there's a shot of what he sees in the sky, then back to his face which reveals an expression that borders on skeptical, and a bit crazed, or more. Mifune's part is of a barbarian, but all the more believable as a human barbarian since he acts as such with animal desires- he sees the woman in the woods, and knows he wants her, and while he reflects that he didn't have to have killed the man, he did as a last resort as a man with an urge. This is intensified by a sadistic flee with his actions. What's intriguing about that first description/recollection of the battle between him and the other man, is that it seems like it could be the truth, and to one viewer it could, and to another it seems like it could all be apart of his hyperactive and trapped imagination. And in the attack of the bandit on the woman, at first to him, it's like a game, then in later descriptions, he feels a little more un-easy, then later, it's of neither pleasure or discomfort, it just is. This kind of technique later happens with the woman who was victim (who has conviction, though is herself an archetype of Lifetime women), the presence who saw it "all", and with the man who in the beginning didn't understand. In each telling the expressions, the cut-aways, the lighting and movement by Kazuo Miyagawa, it's equally startling, exhilarating. That the film gives off such a hypnotic aura isn't surprising, or perhaps it is for those in the grips of the emotion of it all- the dead man's story is like the hook ripping into a twelve foot bass. The final accouter of the tale proves the most accurate to the common observer, yet Kurosawa knows that's not the point- if he made it as such to be bold AND had a definite concrete point, the ending would be as poignant when revealed is the truth, or what one could believe as the closest thing to it is. We know why that last person didn't want to get involved with the courts with what he knows: his story is no more a revelation, of any comfort or consolation to the listeners, than the others. I highly recommend this to anyone, and to those who have distaste to foreign films should view it once anyway- it's certainly not a long movie, and it won't loose its grip on anyone willing to give itself to the tale(s). For me, it's another to add to my top 50 of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant masterpiece from a masterful director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rashomon" was Akira Kurosawa's first national hit (becoming, at the time, the highest-grossing foreign film in America) and even gained an Oscar for Best Foreign Film, but almost sixty years later it still hasn't lost any of its impact. It is widely revered as one of the most influential films of all-time, but unlike some other movies, it is not a film that feels dated. The revolutionary methods of Kurosawa are still effective and on-par with the cinema of today -- this isn't a movie where you say, "Yeah, fifty years ago it might have been different, but now it's done in all the movies." Kurosawa's techniques are still superior to most of his imitators. Look at the 2003 John McTiernan film, "Basic," which copies a good portion of "Rashomon's" concept. Which is the better film? It's not a hard choice.The film begins under a structure which reads "Rashomon" on its exterior, in a small Japanese village. It's raining outside and a woodcutter (Takashi Shumura) and a priest (Minoru Chiaki) inadvertently find themselves in the company of a wandering commoner (Kichijiro Ueda), and as he asks them what is the matter they both begin to relay the most horrific story they claim to know -- of a brutal murder a few days prior.Kurosawa then switches to flashback and we see three different versions of the exact same event -- the slaying of an innocent man (the murderer played by Kurosawa film regular Toshirô Mifune) in the woods outside the village. Was it because of lust? Betrayal? Envy? Or insanity? We hear from the murderer, the wife of the victim, and a woman channeling the spirit of the dead man."Rashomon" is brilliant. Some people have complained that the ending is a cop-out and sentimental hogwash, but I think Kurosawa was fond of sentimentality to a point (he uses a good deal of it in "Ikiru") but the difference between what he does with sentimentality as opposed to many filmmakers of today is that he uses to to ENRICH the story, not provide an easy solution to all the problems.Is there resolution in the finale of "Rashomon"? To a degree. But, like "Ikiru," it also leaves an open answer to its audience -- this film questions us, and our humanity, and it says something about the human condition and our weaknesses as a species. Yet it also proposes that along with the evil is an inherent good, and in my opinion the message of "Rashomon" is just as important and effective as its film-making techniques and acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I saw it with my own eyes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This fabulous work was years and years ahead of its time when it was made in 1950, being a work of art that engages the eyes and the ears, but most essentially, the brain. The film is both aesthetically beautiful, using amazing camera techniques, extensive periods of silence and a very limited cast to deliver the action, and the story is typically Japanese...ostensibly amazingly simple, but complex to the point of sending you cross-eyed!The basic tale is this: a woman and her husband, a Samurai, are travelling through a forest when they meet a bandit. The bandit has sex with the woman and the Samurai ends up dead. That's it. This tale is related to us through the woodcutter and a monk who saw the protagonists give their evidence to the police (the dead Samurai through a medium), but unfortunately the three tales conflict with one another. Each confessor says that they killed the Samurai, and then we hear from the woodcutter who in fact witnessed the event, who gives us a version of events that borrows from each individual account, and is still less credible!The conclusion presented by Kurosawa seems to be firstly that individuals see things from different perspectives, but secondly, and most importantly, that there is no objective truth. There is no answer as to what took place in the forest, and Kurosawa offers us no way of knowing what went on. Each story is as credible as the other, and so no conclusion about guilt can be reached. We even have to think at the end that as the whole thing is reported to us by the woodcutter and priest, was there any truth in anything we heard at all?This film leads to an especially tricky conclusion for a movie-goer! Your eyes are supposed to show you objective truth, but they don't. The camera is supposed not to lie, but it does. I feel that the simple message is that subjectivity lies at the heart of life, and this subjectivity needs to be recognised before any attempt is made to understand events.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most of the time we can't even be honest with ourselves.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To have a film that holds the coveted title of being the reason that the "Best Foreign Film" category was created for the Oscars is one thing, but to be able to back up that myth with a powerful film that speaks both about humanity and the strength of truth is a whole new angle. Often we witness powerful foreign films that slip through the lines of cinema, regarded by so many as valuable assets to the film community, but never see the gold of Oscar. In the same sense, sometimes the most popular of those foreign films eventually become Oscar contenders, not because they are worthy enough, but because studios had the funds to allow bigger distribution to audiences, thus allowing popularity to do the rest. Rashômon is one of those few films that succeed in giving us both a quality film and the accolades to represent it. Rashômon is a rare breed of film. The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa took many bold steps with this film (pointing his camera at the sun, filming deep within the jungle, and the mockery of truth), that it is unlikely that you could go to a modern day Hollywood film without seeing one of these techniques being "borrowed". His bold storytelling, creative camera work, and powerful characters give us a unique story that should be included in everyone's film library.While the characters were strong, the direction was flawless, and the story was compelling, there is a theme that needs to be discussed while talking about Rashômon. This is the story of murder, betrayal, and rape and in any typical "courthouse" film you would have some spineless witness finally break down and confess the truth. At the end of these films the truth is discovered, but not in Rashômon. Kurosawa gives us the "black sheep" of themes by never really giving us what we really wanted from the beginning of this story. As I began this film, I thought I was going to get a clear-cut story with honesty and troubled souls, but instead I was handed no prize at the end. What I sought after the most is not handed to me in a Happy Meal container at the end, but instead trapped still within the film. Kurosawa gives us the meaning behind the story, that there possibly is no way of knowing the true "truth". Four different souls, seeing the same event all culminating to four different results means that the "truth" may never be known. Kurosawa has taken the story and provided us with the main character being truth, and like Kaiser Soze, the greatest trick it ever pulled was convincing us that "it didn't exist". Deep within Rashômon the truth is hidden, and it may never emerge, but that is what Kurosawa intended. A viewer could walk away from this film, after several viewings, and discover different truths about the characters and story. This is a constantly evolving film that will continually get better with time.Outside of these beautiful themes, Rashômon is a flawless film. From the execution of the actors to the simplicity of the direction, there is plenty in this film to keep your mind busy and your jaw nearly dragging on the floor. To begin, the performance by Toshiro Mifune ranks among the best in film history. In each of the stories he is portrayed differently (even in his own) and with precise execution he delivers every time. He is insane, passionate, loyal, and villainous all at the same time. While some may see his acting as eccentric or over-the-top, I found each of his portrayals as accurate and astute. When Mifune is on the screen his presence commands your eyes and you cannot help but become involved. Second to his performance is that of the troubled wife. While her characters is the most confusing/suspicious of them all, Masayuki Mori keeps us intertwined with the story by controlling her character with the greatest of ease. When it is time for her to be unleashed, the true drama of the story is thrown in your face with brilliance and expertise.Overall, I thought that this was a near perfect film. Kurosawa is intense, original, and adeptly secure about his stories. I have seen the same passion in Ran, and it cannot be denied. My only concern with this film is that if you are going to watch this movie, make sure that you can devote your entire mind to it. I found myself watching it three times because I could not stay focused (outside factors) enough to see those darkly hidden themes. I especially enjoyed the unearthed darkness of humanity, which is hinted on at the end. The fact that after hearing these stories of murder and rape, it doesn't stop one from continuing along a similar path. It is a powerful tale that should be enjoyed by all! Grade: **** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To what extent does subjectivity affect perception?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rashomon" tells a very simple tale in a very complicated manner, presenting four 'versions' of the truth, each from a party either witness to or involved in the incident depicted. It is not the film's intent to have you piece together a puzzle since that would be impossible based on how drastically the four tales differ. We know that lies don't enter the equation since the participating persons all claim to be guilty. "Rashomon" is not about choosing a version of the incident you believe is true; it is about human perspective and how it shapes what we see. Even if we truly believe what we have seen is true, is it really? The film opens when a priest and woodcutter are encountered by a man who engages in a conversation about crime with them and subsequently learns that a samurai has been killed in the woods and his wife raped by a bandit. These two details are the basic, practically undisputed facts which make up the foundation of the four versions of the story we hear: the bandit's, the woman's, her husband's (through a medium), and the woodcutter's (the only presumably objective account, which still does not make sense in relation to the others). In many ways the best thing about "Rashomon" is that it never reveals what actually happens (or if any of the four accounts is in fact true), and although we are not meant to solve the mystery (the idea here is that there is no objective truth since humans are too selfish and dishonest to view anything without bias) the story structure is still brilliant and adds a lot of ambiance to the film. The narrative flow is strong and the method seems fresh and inventive today despite countless imitations (including one inexplicably popular one- "The Usual Suspects")."Rashomon" is very much a visual film. It would be reduced to unimportant and insignificant fare without the cinematography, which captures the mood and feel of the jungle perfectly, as does the score. The film achieves an epic feel very rare for films filmed in fullscreen, especially during the battle between the bandit and the samurai during the last telling of the story. Kurosawa was also wise enough to choose a location for the film that would accurately capture the eerie, slightly disturbing mood of the story. Just picture the events taking place anywhere other than a jungle."Rashomon" is not without its (minor) flaws, however. While theatrical acting (Kurosawa was fascinated with silent film) worked perfectly with films like "Seven Samurai" and "Throne of Blood", it does nothing but take away from the realism of this oft claustrophobic human drama. Yes, Mifune (Tajomaru, the bandit) does provide an interesting spin on his character for each telling, and Takashi Shumura (the woodcutter) seems as honest and real as any character could possibly be, but nearly all of that effect is lost every time Machiko Kyo appears on screen. It is hard to take her seriously and during moments when I should have been close to tears I was much closer to laughter. I'm not sure how much blame I would place on her as Kurosawa probably asked her to act exactly as she does. While discussing actors I have to (unconventionally) note Fumiko Honma as the medium, who brings a wonderfully eerie air to the film during its greatest scenes.I don't think "Rashomon" is Kurosawa's best or most important film, but it is still a masterful piece of cinema which is absolutely essential for any film lover. It's extraordinary how much Kurosawa accomplished at such an early stage in his career and without the benefit of the lavish budgets he was allotted for later projects. The film's main question is also still relevant and confusing today: is what we think we see really the truth, and to what extent does subjectivity affect perception? 4.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare and a unique masterpiece from the master himself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As oppose to its commonplace plot, Rashomon as a concept is extraordinarily idiosyncratic and perhaps it is this striking attribute that makes it an undisputed masterpiece, howsoever improbable. It vividly limns the artistry of contrivance innate in the human psyche owing to the importunate desire of humans to placate their insatiable egos. This manipulation of facts has no limits and entirely depends upon the skill of imaginative improvisation of the individual along with his level of comfort at skullduggery. The ability to misinterpret comes naturally to the humans as a desperate ploy to counter the adversities of life and that's what makes it indispensable. As a direct consequence of contrivance, the concept of truth no longer remains universal but becomes rather subjective and a matter of individualistic perception. Rashomon pioneered Kurosawa's dream tryst with perpetual brilliance and undoubtedly played a pivotal part in making his name a mark of excellence in the world of cinema. Rashomon is a well knitted tale about a supercilious samurai, his whimsical wife and a boorish bandit. The bandit inveigles the samurai into imprisonment and has his way with samurai's wife. The dead body of the samurai is later discovered under mysterious circumstances by a woodcutter. The bandit is captured and arraigned along with the deranged widow of the samurai. Their narrated versions seem such contrasting that a psychic is called upon to conjure up the dead samurai's spirit to record his testimony in order to corroborate the facts that seemed excessively manipulated. The samurai's version yet again differs considerably from the testimonies of the other two. Each version though different seemed to satiate the respective ego of the testifier. The woodcutter, who didn't want to get involved personally, later confesses to a priest to have actually witnessed the incident and comes up with a version of his own which falsifies the other three. The movie is ingenious as its actual motive has nothing to do with the revelation of truth as verity is merely a matter of lame perception, but rather is to highlight the discrepancies among the different versions as a medium to depict the irrational complexities associated with the human psyche. The concept of Rashomon though well ahead of its time, sowed the seeds for creative innovation in the world of cinema and has served as the undisputed benchmark of innovative excellence for well over five decades. A quintessential Kurosawa classic, strongly recommended to the masses for its sheer brilliance and enigmatic charm. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The more I watch and re-watch Kurosawa's films, the more I am sure that he will be remembered as the greatest director of the 20th century. Although I prefer "Ran" and "The Seven Samurai" for reasons of personal taste, I don't think I would argue very much with anyone who proposed that "Rashomon" was his best film. Made in 1950, it is so unusual and so far ahead of it's time that it takes your breath away.The story itself deserves a mention: A husband &amp; wife travelling through woods are attacked by a thief, who ties up the husband and rapes the wife. This is as much of the story as we can be sure of. The husband ends up dead of a stab wound. How did he die? Who was responsible? Each of the three give their accounts before a court (the dead husband through a medium!), and each account is entirely different. A woodcutter who witnessed the events gives a fourth, entirely different, account.Each flashback is an absolute gem in itself, and lives long in the mind. Toshiro Mifune as the thief exudes more raw masculinity and charisma that I think I have ever seen in ANY movie, and creates a totally believeable character. Machiko Kyo as the wife is superb in what are essentially four different roles, her own version being the highlight. The husband's character is the least well developed, but since he spends a lot of the time either tied up or dead, that's not really surprising.Because the viewer knows that each flashback is highly personal to the teller, a vast amount of brainpower and concentration are required if you are going to try to work out what actually DID happen. Alternatively, watch the film twice back-to-back, once for the visuals and acting, and once for the detective work and philosophical implications.My favourite shot in the movie is one which starts with the husband and wife kneeling, facing each other, a view of the wife over the shoulder of the husband; the camera then moves round to the side and simultaneously zooms in on the wife's profile; then pulls back behind the wife, ending with a view of the husband's face over the shoulder of the wife - a mirror image of the initial shot in the sequence. Absolutely awesome! And dating from 1950! Unbelievable!I normally try to keep my reviews a LOT shorter than this, but I make no apologies in this case. Indeed, there are lots of other points I would like to make (I haven't even mentioned the central importance of the dagger, or the relevance of the Rashomon gate itself). I could go on and on and on... however, a better use of your time would be to seek out and watch this film...NOW!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kurosawa is just so damn good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rashomon", Akira Kurosawa's 1950 film about a horrible crime and the various versions of the "truth" that come to fruition during the investigation is absolutely amazing, pure and simple. The story is told four different times, each time from the point of view of one of the participants. The basic story of the crime is that a bandit (Mifune) comes across a husband and wife traveling through the forest. The bandit, Tajomaru, seduces/assaults the Masako (Kyo) after tying up her husband Takehiro (Mori), and soon after, Takehiro is dead. What happens between the times Tajomaru encounters the couple and the discovery of Takehiro's body is what is left to be discovered. Masako, Tajomaru and even Takehiro (with the assistance of a medium) each tell their account of the story, each taking blame for Takehiro's death. The fourth telling is from a passer-by, and the audience is left to decide which is the true account.I absolutely loved this film. I had heard that Yimou Zhang's "Hero" had, if not as an homage, employed the same technique of storytelling and perspective, but seeing this great film was a real treat. The story is original and rich, and Kurosawa always is able to pull great performances from his actors. I found "Rashomon" to be extremely compelling from start to finish, and even managed to be really creeped out at one point. (The psychic medium is pure, unadulterated nightmare fuel) From the very little that I know of Japanese cinema of the 1950's &amp; 1960's, I realize that Kurosawa was not the only director, but he certainly was the trailblazer and set the bar for the genre for decades to come. His peers were putting out material, it was just fairly primitive. (It is easy to forget that not every country's film industry was as opulent as America's) To see this kind of film, a film that is actually incredibly simple, but so ingeniously conceived of and executed makes me remember why I have been and always will be both a student of and lover of film. 8/10 --Shelly</fullReview>

People prefer to live a lie than admit the truth, very reminiscent of today's world. The characters are talking to us, we are the jury.The performances are amazing, nothing acting is so good, blows away today's competition.The film score is stunning as well, one of my favourites from a Japanese film.The direction is breathtaking, the jungle is beautifully lit, it has a sense of horror to it.

		<shortDescription>"I just don't understand this story"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These are the opening words of Rashômon, and in a way that's also a summary of the entire film. It is the story of four testimonies of the same event that couldn't differ more. It is told by a priest and a woodcutter to a commoner, as they seek shelter from the rain under the Rashomon gate. The priest and the woodcutter were witnesses in a trial, and what they heard there made them puzzled, and after they told everything, the viewer is just as puzzled as these two. What happened? Takehiro, a samurai has been murdered and Masako, his wife has been raped, the suspect is Tajômaru. And indeed, in court he confesses to have raped the woman and to have killed the samurai in duel. Masako however tells quite a different story: After Tajômaru took advantage of her, he left and despair and pity made her kill her husband, but to commit suicide, just as she originally planned, she's to weak. Then the murdered samurai speaks, through the voice of a medium. In his story, he committed suicide because of disgust at his wife, who asked Tajomaru to kill him in order to accompany the robber. At the end, we hear even another story from the woodcutter, who was, as he reveals, an eyewitnesses. In his version, Tajômaru killed the samurai in a duel (or rather: in a brawl) that was demanded by his wife. Now what did really happen? Why did at least three of these four people lie? The reason cannot be (as the commoner says at one point) that everyone told what was useful for him, since, except for the woodcutter, everyone told a story in which he was the killer. So do they all think their story is true? Do they all feel guilty for a reason or another? These questions will cause endless discussions once you watch this film. And the end, Kurosawa raises another question: If man keeps lying (to others as well as to himself), does that mean he is evil? This question is underlined by the crying baby the three men find in the Rashômon gate. Kurosawa's answer to this question is clearly a no: the woodcutter takes the baby to raise him and the priest realizes that he is a good man, even although he's a lier and a thief. But if Kurosawa had only raised these questions, Rashômon wouldn't have become such a classic as it is considered today. He is telling his story with breathtaking images, as when he's holding his camera directly into the sun, when he uses the wood, light and shadow to create a dense atmosphere, or when he shows the trial scenes, where he makes the witnesses talk to the viewers to make them feel like the judges. The fight scenes are all terrifically shot, and the scene before Masako kills Takehiro can move you to tears. Rashômon also has some good acting, especially the breathtaking Toshirô Mifune in one of film history's most unforgettable performances as the wild robber Tajômaru, always jumping around and seemingly untamable and unafraid. All this makes Rashômon a mind-boggling experience, that had me talk all night through with friends of mine, and still stirs me whenever i watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Technical &amp; Creative Success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to tell just how striking "Rashômon" might have seemed to those who watched it in 1950, rather than seeing it after so many subsequent movies and other works have made use of its techniques and ideas. But it's clear that it is a technical and creative success. The story itself is not particularly satisfying, which was most likely by design, and the movie is carried by its structure and by the concept of the markedly different perspectives on the same series of events. The cast also deserve their share of credit for how well it works, and the photography is excellent, as it is in almost all of Kurosawa's films.Kurosawa's expertise makes the interwoven sequences of past and present - essentially telling two different stories - not only work flawlessly, but fit together thematically. It's even more commendable when compared to some of the subsequent films that have tried to use similar ideas, only to come off as pretentious rather than creative or innovative. Kurosawa was also working with much less in terms of possible precedents.In one sense, the choice of specific story material could seem a little odd.The downbeat, rather sordid scenario makes the movie somewhat less enjoyable than several of Kurosawa's other pictures (which is, admittedly, a pretty high standard), and as a result "Rashômon" is more a film to respect and admire than one to enjoy and take pleasure from. Still, it does have significantly more substance to it than do most of the more recent pictures that have been deliberately downbeat or negative in their portrayals of humanity. Such stories are more trendy at present, and they often receive undue praise simply for so being.At the same time, the lack of sympathetic characters and the paucity of hopeful developments bring out all the more its success in developing its ideas about narrative and about reality, ideas that are more fundamental and, in their way, perhaps at least as important as any specific story or events.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kurosawa, do I need to say more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kurosawa tells a story four times through different characters. The characters tell the story different four times. In flash-backs, all as the characters tell them, we see the stories. Are they lying, are they all telling their own truth or is there someone who tells THE truth? The way this is handled by Kurosawa is absolutely masterful.Of course, his direction is great. Together with cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa they do a tremendous job with the atmosphere in the woods. With perfect light angles it looks beautiful.A real Japanese classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roshomon ? Kurosawa's journey into human psyche? In search of truth!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the stories, 'Roshomon' and 'In a Grove' by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, this is a masterpiece by the legendary Akira Kurosawa.Highly regarded for its philosophical undertones and its exploration of the unfathomable human psyche, 'Roshomon' is a brilliantly spun riddle. It is about the four people, who give four different versions of the testimonies at the court, on the recently occurred crime.The story is set in ancient Japan, where three passers-by seek shelter from intense rain in the ruined temple called Roshomon. Two of the witnesses, a dumbfounded woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) and a priest (Minoru Chiaki), are narrating the crime trial to the commoner. More than the crime, they are astonished to witness the testimonies of three people, connected with the crime, which shatters their faith in humanity.A man (Masayuki Mori) has been murdered, and his wife (Machiko Kyo) was allegedly raped, while they were traveling in the woods. A notorious bandit (Toshiro Mifune) has been arrested, regarding this despicable act. As the trial starts, the fabricated lies resurface over truth. According to the bandit, he and the man waged a war after the rape, resulting in the man's death.But the woman's version is that she was rejected by her husband, after being raped. So, with uncontrollable grief, she killed him. However, the dead man testifies, through the medium, that the bandit insisted to marry the woman after the rape, but the woman demanded the bandit should kill her husband first. The angry bandit left the place and the guilty-conscious man committed suicide. According to the woodcutter, the woman had manipulated the two men, who were finally pushed to gruesome fight that lead to the man's death.All these testimonies are believably told to the viewers, making them the judges of this baffling trial? At Oscars, the board of governors voted 'Roshomon' as the most outstanding foreign language film released in the US in 1951. This was an enormously challenging task for the artistes? who had to enact in 3 different ways for the same story? and they excel. Toshiro Mifune attained worldwide fame for enacting the clumsy bandit's role with insurmountable passion.'Roshomon' is not about analyzing the chronological facts or its relevance. It focuses on, how perspective distorts reality and makes the absolute truth unknowable. Eventually, this movie has been touted as the classic case study for the film students, connoisseurs and movie critics, all over the world.This simple-looking tale, with its complex web of deceptive elements, remains as the finest cinematic riddle unsolved!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was Kurosawa's first big international hit, from then on his films would be avidly watched and (usually) feted as Art. His style was always so breathtakingly simple that you can't help but get sucked into the rainy and sunny bestial world depicted in here, with a beautiful use of the black and white nitrate film stock contrasting against a sordid storyline. I've probably seen it 10 times now over the decades and it seems to get better every time I settle down to it - it's been a continual treat.A horror story from a few days previous is recounted on a ferociously wet day: beautiful woman is (apparently) raped by animalistic bandit in front of her husband who is then (apparently) murdered. But who really did what to who and why? It's told from four viewpoints: the bandit's, the honourable woman's, the heroic dead husband's via a rather startling medium and lastly a breathless version from a timid eye-witness. The event becomes a crime scene with the beauty of forest surrounding us and splintered sunlight beaming down on us through the trees bearing mute witness to the savage few moments. It's a salutary lesson in Human Beings vs Objectivity; the psychologies of the main protagonists are laid bare, as well as the story-tellers, even to Kurosawa and the viewers themselves. Who's telling the truth/ was it a mixture of all versions/ was there another truth untold? Only you can decide!I urge all innocent bystanders who have a problem with b&amp;w non-HD 4:3 subtitled Japanese films from 1950 to try to get over it! Because it's a riveting journey, expertly handled by probably the best film director who's ever lived, all subjective of course.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nested, Folded, Parallel Narrative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Superficially about truth, this is more fundamentally about the nature of nested and floating narrative. Kurosawa is one of three men who invented film, and this is his most influential one. Much is made of the construction of the story, which you can read elsewhere. I'd like to focus here on what I think is the rarest of Kurosawa'a abilities: the way he changes the eye of the camera -- and the composition of the world it creates for us -- for each of the narratives.Some are impressionistic; some flat and full of contrast; some deep. Some are composed around people, some around the environment with people in it, some around fleeting motion. Sometimes the words are the organizing principle, sometimes images.I know other directors who can do this once within a film: to twist the consciousness of the viewing eye to match the perspective of the narration, even some capable of a dual view within and without. But I know of no one else capable of doing so multiply within the same film and with such obvious link to the story.The DVD is astonishingly clear. It has an introduction by Altman which says nothing interesting; but watch his hands. The DVD has a commentary which is horrid -- just the sort of talky vapidity about apparent insight the film criticizes!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Masterpiece of Akira Kurosawa Showing Different Perspectives of a Crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a heavy rainy day on the Eleventh Century, a priest, a woodcutter and a common person are protected together in the ruined temple of Rashomon. They are discussing a recent murder of a man and rape of his wife by the bandit Tajômaru (Toshirô Mifune, in a superb performance). Each one of them has a version for the crime, including the one from the spirit of the dead husband. In the end, an event with an abandoned child and the symbolic appearance of the sun shine return hope in human race for the priest. This film is amazing, stunning, a masterpiece. The screenplay is fantastic and shows different perspectives for a same event. This was the theme of one of the classes I had of Methodology of Science many years ago (the same event, watched by different persons in different angles, presents different testimonies). Akira Kurowasa offered us a magnificent (as usual) direction of a movie performed by an outstanding cast and a having one of the most wonderful black &amp; white photography I have ever seen. My vote is ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who is more wrong?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, you need to appreciate the fact that everyone in Rashômon lied. This includes the Buddhist priest because he mentioned that everyone is good in nature. Even though he is aware of stories of rape and murder, he chooses to live in self-denial; to have faith in the goodness of humanity. Therefore, if you are still debating on who is absolutely right or wrong, then you are probably missing Kurosawa's intention. We need to analyze who is more wrong than the rest. Similarly, philosophy students will go off-topic if they choose to debate on whether Euthyphro was absolutely right or wrong to prosecute his father for accidentally murdering a murderer.The deceased samurai claims that someone removed the dagger from his chest and the woodcutter admits to the theft in the ending. So, let us start from here. Two claims from two accounts support that the murder weapon was a dagger. This eliminates the possibility that the murder weapon was a sword. Therefore, the bandit lied about killing the samurai with a sword. It is plausible that his ego as a famous bandit made him conjure this lie. In fact, it is possible that he ran off like a typical bandit after the rape without engaging a meaningless fight with the angry samurai.Did the deceased samurai lie? Yes. Remember what I said earlier, everyone lied in this film. The discussion should be centered on who lied the most. It is plausible that he did not commit suicide even though the murder weapon has been verified to be a dagger in the above paragraph. It is possible that the deceased samurai lied about his suicide to protect any remaining samurai dignity because the bandit raped his wife. So who killed him then? It is possible that his wife actually tripped and killed him accidentally with the dagger. To reveal the truth that he was killed in a freak accident is probably one of the last things in a respectable samurai's mind.Finally, the woodcutter, probably the biggest liar of all the characters' lies combined. He lied from the beginning, filed a false police report, made false statements in front of the judge, stole the valuable dagger and angrily accused the deceased samurai of lying about the murder weapon, which was later exposed by the commoner. He even reprimanded the commoner for stealing the clothes from an abandoned baby, which shows how hypocritical he is. All these accumulated lies make his claim of having a family of six children extremely unreliable. In the ending, the woodcutter was wearing a mild smile while walking towards the camera with the baby in his arms. The unusual eerie music played in the ending was also very suggestive. In my opinion, he is probably going to sell the baby to the black market for more money, considering the fact that he stole the murder weapon out of greed.Rashômon's ending was left open-ended by Kurosawa and I urge the audience not to watch on a superficial level. The ending is not as simple as it seems. This is Kurosawa we are talking about, not any random 'grade C' director. It is definitely not a hundred percent happy conclusion. Another open-ended film directed by Kurosawa is 'Rhapsody in August' (1991), which I studied for my film module.Mao points: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too drawn out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rashomon runs only 88 minutes, which to me is fairly short for a feature-length movie, but it seems this could have been accomplished in about 45 minutes or an hour. Many of the scenes are too drawn out, simply taking too long to achieve what we already know is going to happen.You can notice this early as we spend minutes just watching the Woodcutter walk through the forest. There are interesting shots and directing techniques in this scene, but it goes on for too long.Also see the wife's extended bouts of crying, although her performance is great in the Woodcutter's version of the story, in the scene where her tirade on the male species motivates the two men to fight each other.But it further drags as the wife takes forever to kill the husband, then the husband takes forever to kill himself, the final sword fight that goes on longer than it needs to. The outcomes of these scenes are predictable. The predictability is not the problem. The problem is that these scenes linger on when we already know what the result will be. We know the final sword fight will end with the bandit killing the husband with his sword because the Woodcutter has already swore that the husband died by sword before we entered his version of the truth. If we did not know the result, this might be suspenseful, but since we already do, it just drags.The story itself I found to be very good, but the case here is that the screenplay has been cursed by having been directed by its own writer. So I have settled on rating it a 5. Luckily for Kurosawa, many of you don't feel the same way.Having said that, I have seen Seven Samurai before this, rated it an 8, and though it's damn long at nearly three-and-a-half hours, I did not feel it was as drawn out, though maybe it would be easier to swallow if it were two separate movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dirty degradation away from mysticism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rashomon is one of those movies that at first seems to have a lot of peculiarities, but upon further viewing makes more and more sense. It doesn't need multiple viewings in order to be appreciated, though... it's impact is pretty immediate. It's just that some of the things that seem more odd about it are much more lasting than one would think.The story is about four people who are involved in a rape, a murder, and a theft in the woods, and how each tells the story of the events with a different stress in order to make themselves look better. What is clear is this: a woman was taken in front of her husband by a bandit. The husband was killed. His sword was taken by the bandit and the woman's dagger somehow disappeared. With those elements, a cynical outside observer hears the stories of each character and eventually comes to the conclusion he has from the beginning: that people are selfish and self-interested, and that good no longer exists in the world.The woman's, bandit's, and witness's stories are more easily accepted, but what do we do with the presence of the dead husband's ghost and his story, especially when the priest points out that "dead men don't lie"? Akira Kurosawa often puts metaphysical beings into the story with the same matter-of-fact quality as he does any other character, and to a cynical observer's eye, this could be considered a distraction. However, just the ghost helps illustrate just how far Japanese society has degraded away from classic values. Just as the listener of the tales tears apart Rashomon temple as the movie progresses for the selfish need of firewood, the ghost no longer is held to the same amount of abstractly definite authority. The presence of the priest and his clenched grip around his faith in humanity helps create a dialog about how removed people have become from abstract concepts of good and evil. The ghost, the priest, and the temple are all a very important part of the story, the same way the outsider's anecdote, "They say the demon who resided here fled rather than be met with the evil of human beings" has dire importance to the interplay of relationships in this film.Kurosawa's skill is not just in dialog and relationships, his visual acuity helps accentuate these themes as well. When the story begins, the woods is magical, even colorful (despite the black and white photography). It is a woods of fairy tale, with magical breezes and quiet streams. As the movie progresses, the woods lose more and more of their mystical quality and become dirty and dry. By the time the battle between the husband and the bandit is played out in its final representation, it is no longer a valiant battle of skill against two well-versed opponents, its a stressful, scary affair that has the two kicking up more dust than swinging their swords. The dust itself shows the degradation of the story away from the abstract qualities of truth and justice to a much more dirty, ugly reality as promoted by the outsider.I don't think Akira Kurosawa necessarily holds the theme of this movie as utter truth, especially considering the hopeful ending, but it does seem as if this movie came during a very cynical time during Kurosawa's life. Many discuss it as a post-war film, which isn't a bad guess. But even without it's affinity to the post-war world of Japan at the time, it somehow has a profound effect on viewers even today.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated piece of cra... cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are several reasons why this film is painful to watch. The first reason is the childish cinematography. While this may have something to do with conditions in postwar Japan, the cinematography is far exceeded by many films of the early twentieth century, so it has nothing to do with the film's age. As for the story, it is almost nonexistent?thin gruel for a film that presents so many different perspectives. The lack of a story probably accounts for the painfully slow pacing. It takes a Herculean effort of will not to shout at the screen, "Get on with it!" Still, good acting can often salvage the weakest story. Sadly, the acting in Rashômon mostly consists of odd poses and staring. For the first five minutes, the lingering shots of overwrought facial expressions and contorted bodies can induce an occasional chuckle. After about twenty minutes, you'll wish you had access to a dagger, too. This tedium is punctuated by comically staged sword fights. I mean, how long can two expert swordsmen wrestle and parry without a decent thrust? Again, get on with it! Of the film's many annoyances, the worst are the idiotic laughing of the bandit and the screeching of the woman. With his constant ha-ha-has, you have to ask, is the bandit insane? Is he reckless? Is he a really, really bad actor? As for the woman?well, if she's the vision of a goddess, thank god I'm an atheist! Once you hear the dulcet tones that come from this angel?a scream slightly more annoying than the amplified sound of fingernails running down a chalkboard?you wonder why a sword or a dagger wasn't immediately used on her.Sorry folks, the Chrysanthemum Emperor has no clothes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's human to lie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first Kurosawa film that really punctured the Amero-centric film bubble, that left Hollywood the near sole producer of films after their nearest competition, Germany, lost their best directors due to Anti-Semitic pogroms. Thankfully, there is no pandering to try and imitate such a film, there are no musical numbers, not much action of any kind, and characters that aren't the nicest of people.The story starts in the rain, as a group of people huddle around under an abandoned building to avoid it. From there, the common man is told by a woodcutter about a rape and murder in the woods, as well as a depressed monk who is losing his faith in the human species. From there, we are told multiple differing stories from multiple perspectives about what happened, and all of them vehemently contradict each-other. All of them cast a mystery that gives the viewer nothing to go on but their words.What makes it work is that all of the stories, though self-pitying, all feel like they could have happened. There is no favouritism between the three parties, and all are giving 100% believable performance when they retell their stories, including minor pieces of exposition which lend credence to their tales yet further.We are consistently cutting back to the commoner who's actually pretty funny and worldly, who offers a simple, unpretentious counter to the more philosophical world-view that Kurosawa is trying to explore. His crudeness is even somewhat likable. His attempts to try and rationalise the stories are magnificent in their roughness. There is further character development between the monk and woodcutter, both of whom have character arcs in their own right. Both stories, that of the 3 under the building, and the rape and murder, are excellent in their own right, but once combined, we can even then see parallels between them, and that shifts the film into masterpiece territory, without being a completely inaccessible puddle of pretentious cinema. This is a film a 12 year old who likes Transformers can watch as well as some 50 year old Swedish artisan.One really gets a sense of the desperation eating at men's souls, including in all the murder scenes, and the sniping between the nihilist commoner and the (clinging) spiritual monk. There is a sense of underlying nastiness at the heart of everyone, but likewise a sense of potential redemption, though it most certainly doesn't completely conquer all that is wrong. Rashomon leaves us with an honest portrayal of the human species that doesn't leave us completely hopeless, nor wilfully ignorant.It leaves us with hope, and hope can only exist in fear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I want more of Kurosawa after this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie which introduced Japanese cinema to the world. The movie which introduced Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune to the west - Rashomon. Based on ancient Japan where Samurai's dwelled and women had no rights, Rashomon is actually a series of flashbacks. The movie starts with a woodcutter, a priest and a commoner discussing about something unusual that happened in the court that day. The Woodcutter was summoned to the court as a witness to the dead body of a Samurai. As, the movie progresses, it is clear that an infamous bandit killed the Samurai because of the lust of his beautiful wife. This particular crime though is recalled from four different point's of view. The bandit, the Samurai's wife, the dead Samurai himself (With the help of black magic, entering the body of another human) and the woodcutter who was an eyewitness to the entire murder scene. All four of them present completely different perspectives of the same murder and it is left to the audience to decide whose version may be true. But this movie does not stop at being a murder and crime mystery. It also takes a closer look at the human psychology and behavior in different situations and conditions.The plot itself is very unique and engaging . Kurosawa has made this already interesting plot into an exceptional movie with his accurate and detailed direction. The Cinematography is also of the highest order which enhances the feel of the movie. Special credit goes to all the actors who had to shoot the same scenario four times but with different mindsets, expressions and dialogues. Among the actors, a special mention should go to Toshiro Mifune (Kurosawa'a favorite actor) who ruled the screen with his animalistic rage and passion. A very enriching movie experience which left me wanting for more of the great director. In my all-time favorite movie's list straightaway .Rating : 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Japanese crime drama , regarding deeds since various points of sight as people explain them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 12th century Japan, a heinous crime and its aftermath are recalled from differing points of view . As a samurai and his wife are attacked by the notorious bandit Tajomaru, and the samurai ends up dead . An episode , rape and killing in a forest grove is reported by four witnesses : a priest , a woodcutter , a commoner , a famous bandit named Tajômaru , even the dead man, speaking through a medium was lying , each from their own point of sight , but the testimonies of the three direct participants were mutually contradictory and claiming responsibility for the death . Every time the story is retold , each person has a different opinion . This is a magnificent picture by Akira Kurosawa starred by his ordinary actor Toshiro Mifune , being his international breakthrough one . Rashomon , the picture blends drama , suspense , emotion and results to be pretty entertaining as well as thought provoking . The movie is a reflection of life, and life does not always have clear meanings . Its striking visual effects and evocative atmosphere made Kurosawa a name outside Japan . The flick is tense and mysterious from the beginning till ending and is neither boring , nor dull but enjoyable . This movie is known for its use of symbolic weather , throughout most of it, there's heavy rain, which fades away by the optimistic ending, when the weather becomes sunny . The screenplay of the film has a twisted plot and the final gets an extraordinary surprise . This picture had great impact and influence on American cinema , in fact it was remade as ¨Outrage¨ (1964) by Martin Ritt with Paul Newman , Claire Bloom and ¨Basic¨ by John MacTiernan with John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson . Evocative cinematography plenty of lights and shadows by Miyagawa . A very early use of the "hand held" camera technique , following characters closely through the Woods . This film is often given credit for the first time a camera was pointed directly at the sun , even during high noon the parts of the forest that the crew needed to shoot in were still too dark. Rather than use a regular foil reflector, which did not bounce enough light, Akira Kurosawa and cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa opted to use a full-length mirror "borrowed" from Daiei's costume department. The motion picture was compellingly directed by Akira Kurosawa with both philosophical and psychological overtones . After working in a wide range of genres, Kurosawa made this Rashomon , often credited as the reason the Academy created the "Best Foreign Film" category. When the film was released internationally to rave reviews, many speculated that Akira Kurosawa was influenced by Citizen Kane (1941) in the element of flashbacks that ultimately provide conflicting accounts of events. However, Kurosawa didn't even see Orson Welles's film until several years after . It won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, and first revealed the richness of Japanese cinema to the West. The next few years saw the low-key , touching Living (1952) , the epic The seven samurais (1954), the barbaric , fascinating Shakespeare adaptation Throne of blood (1957) , a Macbeth's version , and a fun pair of samurai movies Yojimbo (1961) and Sanjuro (1962) , these are fiercely-charging , uncompromising pictures . Yet , there was a quieter side to Kurosawa's nature , expressed most succinctly on Living , The Lower Depths and especially the medical drama Red Beard . After a lean period in the late 1960s and early 1970s, though, Kurosawa attempted suicide . He survived, and made a small, personal, low-budget picture with Dodes'ka-den (1970), a larger-scale Russian co-production Dersu Uzala (1975) an epic tale of adventure in turn-of-the-century Siberia and , with the help of admirers Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas, the samurai tale Kagemusha (1980), which Kurosawa described as a dry run for Ran (1985), an epic adaptation of Shakespeare's "King Lear" . He continued to work into his eighties with the more personal Akira Kurosawa's Dreams (1990), and Madadayo (1993) . Kurosawa's films have always been more popular in the West than in his native Japan, where reviewers have viewed his adaptations of Western genres and authors with suspicion , but he's revered by American and European film-makers, one of his least well-known films but most agreeable pictures is The Bad Sleep Well , a transposition of an Ed McBain detective novel , being remade many his pictures such as The seven samurais (1954), as The magnificent seven (1960),The Hidden Fortress (1958), as Star Wars (1977)as Yojimbo (1961) as For a fistful of dollars by Sergio Leone (1964), in fact Kurosawa's style was the biggest single influence on the Spaghetti Western sub-genre ; as his Samurai 'Western's were copied not only in America but also in Italy .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If this was re-made today it could be so much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another one of those films that has had wide spread rave reviews about it. It is another classic in most 'all time films to see' lists and is directed by a man who is compared to Alfred Hitchcock. This is seen through the eyes of general movie buffs and some movie critics that I have researched. Through my eyes however it is another film that is no better than some of the films that we slate being made today. I just don't understand how some films keep their classic status when they are very basic and simple with no real excitement to them.We start here with a Woodcutter and Priest seeking dry shelter in an abandoned building known as Rashomon. They are joined by a Drifter who joins in on their conversation regarding the Woodcutter finding a dead body a few days prior. He tells the Drifter however that none of it makes any sense. We then flashback to the Woodcutter listening in on the stories of the three people involved in the murder. The bandit, the woman he raped and her husband he killed, told through the voice of a medium. Each gives their version of events to the listening jury and although each story translates that the bandit had sex with the woman and then taunted her husband they all end with themselves admitting that they killed the him, including himself suggesting he committed suicide. Nothing adds up until the Woodcutter fills us in on what he actually saw and not what he told us at the beginning.The story is full of hidden messages with most of them relaying to how people are perceived through the eyes of another. People see themselves as something extraordinary but others may see them as weak and feeble, this is in the case of the bandit. It is about perception. This shines well in the film with the acting spot on. Each acting differently depending on whose story they are acting in. It really helps to interact with the story.Lies are also a large theme of the film with the Woodcutter at the beginning stating that people are being deceitful and that this is what he doesn't understand but it turns out that in fact he could be the one being deceitful all along.There is a lot in this movie that has and will go on to influence others. Off the top of my head, Courage Under Fire is one as is Vantage Point but to watch them and then watch this you will think that those films were better that's why although this film isn't bad I don't understand how it is rated as a classic.Some of the camera work is bad with it sometimes struggling to keep up with the action. The fight scenes are poorly choreographed, if at all, and at times are laughable, playing on much longer than what they are needed and they also use poor swipe transitions to move from scene to scene. I know this film was made in a day when all this may have been up to date but it isn't know so why is it still raved so highly about. The story is intriguing but all intrigue slips away when no resolution is formed, I just finished watching it thinking what was the point. Some films work in that sense but when one repeats itself for ninety minutes and then doesn't tell you anything different to what you already knew at the beginning I'm afraid to say some will leave feeling frustrated and disappointed. I'm not completely against this film. Compared to some all time classics this is a better story but I just wonder that if this film was re-made today with better cameras, acting, locations and editing would it still get the same response and knowing some of the critics of today then no it wouldn't it would be slated for all the reasons this should have been but wasn't. Maybe it's something I am not seeing but Rashomon certainly doesn't deserve to be in the 'best films of all time' list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the classic i was expecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The word rashomon has been used to describe quite a few films i have seen in the last couple of years . So i decided to watch the the film where the word originates from . Only two weeks ago i watched Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samarai for the first time and i was really impressed so did Rashomon have the same affect on me? Set in the 11th century, the movie opens with a woodcutter, a priest, and a commoner sheltering from torrential rain in an immense dilapidated wooden structure. This structure, known as Rashomon gate, marks one of the approaches to Kyoto. As the three men wait for the weather to improve, they talk about a legal proceeding stemming from an incident involving a possible murder. A samurai was found dead, and the circumstances surrounding his death are shown from four conflicting points of view.I'm pretty sure no matter how many times you watch this film, Akira Kurosawa never gives enough information in the movie to figure out the truth about what took place on the day of the samurai's death.But without trying to look too deeply into what this film is about , i feel "Rashomon" is about searching for some kind of absolute truth?it's about how differently people perceive the same external event.Do i feel this film deserves the status it quite clearly has in movie making history ? well , yes and no. Quite clearly this is the first time the same story is told from the point of view of more than one person and that has spurned countless classic movies and for that it deserves it's place in history but as a film in it's own right it just didn't do it for me.Some of the overacting annoyed me . The Constant laughing by the bandit and the commoner was both confusing and unnecessary and i found the lack of a conclusion frustrating but what i will say is that Just like " Seven Samurai " it is beautifully shot.Incidentally when Rashomon was being made , the cast approached Kurosawa en masse with the script and asked him, "What does it mean?" The answer Kurosawa gave at that time and also in his biography is that "Rashomon" is a reflection of life, and life does not always have clear meanings.Make of that what you will but at least i wasn't the only one confused! 6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good -- but hardly a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that this movie is quite good. You will not have squandered the hour and a half it takes to watch it. However, a few things bothered me: 1. Perhaps a quibble, but I *hated* the music. The endless loop of what sounded like variations on Bolero for the first half of the movie -- augh! In general, I found it very choreographed; at times, it was more like watching a ballet. It was very overwrought and distracting.2. The acting. Horribly overdone on the part of Toshiro Mifune; at times he seemed to have taken classes at the Daffy Duck School of Acting. He was not the only one overacting, either, just the most prominent.3. The ending. We get through this very subtle and ambiguous movie, where, even at the end, we have no clue which of the four versions (or which mix of the four versions!) of the story actually happened, and Kurosawa absolutely clubs us silly with the theme of redemption. I wanted the movie to end when the woodcutter said, "On days like this, we have cause to be suspicious" (or something similar). I don't know what possessed Kurosawa to bugger the ending like he did, but, in my version, it'd be about two minutes shorter.That said, there's a lot to like about the movie. I love how Kurosawa leads you into a false smugness at the end when it's revealed that the woodcutter stole the dagger. "Ah hah!" I thought; "Clearly, the dead samurai was telling the truth!" I was impressed with my sleuthing, my quick recall of the medium relating that he felt someone removing the dagger. Then it occurred to me that, in every story, the dagger was left behind. Probably my favorite part was when I had to go back and watch the end of all of the stories to ensure that the dagger was still there, either in the samurai or in the ground.Good movie, but in desperate need of a dose of subtlety.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor film propped up by mass disillusionment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa (aka: "AK", the "lesser Kurosawa", etc.) has one of those overblown reputations that earns praise from everyone who can't think for themselves. If the word "overrated" was assigned a picture reference in a dictionary, a portrait of "AK" would probably be the best choice. If the word "lemming" was assigned a synonym in a thesaurus, the term "AK follower" would fit the bill nicely. It's no understatement to say that the sheer level of brainless veneration that's repeatedly thrown at this guy hasn't been seen since the advent of organized religion ? especially when one considers the fact that most of his movies suck, yet are somehow able to earn IMDb average ratings over 8.0. These people need to stop beating around the bush and simply construct cathedrals in his honor for daily worship.Well, I knew this day would come. I'm running out of Japanese movies to watch on Netflix, so I have decided to watch more Akira Kurosawa films - despite the fact that much of what I have already seen has been torture to sit through. However, I do typically enjoy films more after a second viewing, so I decided to give "Rashomon" a second chance. Ironically, I'm going to end up downgrading my original rating from a 4/10 to a 3/10. All it did was remind me of why I don't like this director. I truly dread this little project I've started on.Kurosawa directs yet another dud that tells multiple perspectives of a murder. As is the case with many of this director's films, the acting is wretched. Toshiro Mifune (a good actor) gives what is likely the worst performance of his career as he cackles and stumbles around like Jar Jar Binks. Meanwhile, Takashi Shimura (a terrible actor) basically just stares off into space with those bug eyes of his, mugging for the camera with that smug frown that Kurosawa loves so much (go watch "Ikiru" if you want 2+ hours of Shimura's sad puppy dog glances). As if that weren't bad enough, the lead actress contributes some horribly acted moments during the second half. But the acting isn't the only problem here. The scoring is non-stop and way off base. The mystery simply isn't that interesting or well-written. Some scenes drag on for far too long despite the film being only 88 minutes long. The sword duels are annoying to watch, with characters acting like looney tunes or incompetent doofuses (e.g., stumbling around, dropping swords, missing easy opportunities to kill, acting like children, etc.). Yep, poorly directed crap like this is what I expect from good ole A.K.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>seeing isn't always believing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa's "Rashomon" is not a whodunit at all. The testimony from each of the witnesses deliberately presents contradictory versions of the events. In fact, the interrogations are possibly the most fascinating scenes in the movie: we see the witnesses describing what they saw (or at least what they claim to have seen), but we don't see the interrogators. It's as if WE are the interrogators. By hearing these different stories, we have to reconsider how sure we can be about what we think we know. Not to mention Kurosawa's use of the forest to create a mysterious setting.This is beyond an incredible movie. As with "Seven Samurai" a few years later, Kurosawa knows how to do everything perfectly: direction, cinematography, the works. Of course, probably the most important point is what the one character says noting that we make up stories to help us cope with life. All too true. A masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Come on Homer, You Liked Rashomon." "That's not how I Remember It"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the glorious work of a genius. A blend of unique, exciting and sophisticated storytelling, and visual mastery. Rashomon is essentially a crime mystery set in Japan. The crime is recalled very differently from different people's perspectives, so the audience is never entirely sure what the truth actually is. You build up an idea of the characters, but since they're presented differently each time, you can never have a set idea of who they truly are. The way the plot structured is very stimulating. Often plots that work this way come together at the end like a jigsaw puzzle, but not so with Rashomon. You're left with four very different jigsaw puzzles and no real answers. Visually it's truly excellent. The men recounting the story in a temple in the pouring rain is a glorious visual. I found the whole world that has been created very convincing and completely absorbing. Kurosawa builds tension through knowing exactly when to cut and when to linger, and the music creeps right under your skin. My only minor criticism of the film would be that, by choosing not to show the court, Tajomaru talks in a strange expositional way where he'll repeat the unheard question before giving his answer. This just wasn't my favorite thing as it was a stylistic choice that brought me out of the film if only for a moment. Other than that this film is pretty much perfectly balanced with truly stunning performances. The acting is so visceral, and it has to be to capture the many nuances of these characters. Mifune as Tajomaru is particularly absorbing with his constant animalistic stance and his frequent itching. It's hard to take your eyes off him.I thought this film perfectly captured much of the human essence. Of how people think of themselves, and how they think about others. It will keep you mesmerised throughout and thinking long after it has finished. Masterful storytelling from one of the masters of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Personal Experiences from Rashomon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rashomon displays how masterful director Akira Kurosawa truly was at creating a beautiful story. Rashomon is a series of flashbacks that try to piece together the events of a murdered man and a raped woman. It retells the stories of a wife, a dead husband via a medium, a bandit and lastly a woodsman. Kurosawa explains to the audience that perception and reality are often two very different worlds. Rashomon was made in Japan and released in 1950, well after the horrific events of World War Two. Kurosawa views humanity as weak, corrupt, and morally lost for the duration of the film. The actors portray deceitful and hellish beings up until the rain ceases and a child is brought into the picture. At this moment, Kurosawa shows a glimpse of hope for humanity as the woodsman walks away with the child and the screen fades to black. Not only did the war have an affect on this film but also the styles of German Expressionism left an impression as well. The contrast of light and darkness played a prominent role for each of the character's stories. As the story changes from each character, one can see the light and shadows shifting from one actor to the next. For example, as the bandit tells his story the shadow is cast upon the husband and a gleaming light is proudly shown on him. Additionally, the light is focused more so on the wife (up until the shaming of her) than on the bandit for the husband's side of the story. The use of a gloomy setting and antiheroes are also key indicators of German Expressionism. The storytelling and the depth of the characters made this a captivating film to behold. The different viewpoints of each story about the wife were the most fascinating. She depicted a sad widower, a 'child-like' innocence, a goddess, a con artist, a liar, and a whore. Kurosawa gives the viewers a puzzle but only half of the pieces required to create a clear picture. Overall this motion picture creates a clear portrait on how Kurosawa views humanity. At the last minute, he changes the direction of the film by having the woodsman carry the abandoned baby back to his home. Even though there is much turmoil and disgust in humanity's present state there is also a sliver of hope according to Kurosawa.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greatness comes through the narrative by adding great perspective. Proved by KurosawaTill date, I resisted to touch Kurosawa for I though, I was meek to comprehend his greatness and perhaps even understand it. After watching Rashomon, I must say I am in a complex of a certain dilemma acquired by watching this film. A simple tale can be made complex by adding different versions of narratives to the same story, they are contradictory and inconclusive, yet they add the dimension of thought provoking and making the viewer think actually what could have happened in the story. Perhaps, nothing of what was said and may be all too, but the most important thing it ignites a debate within a mind. Thus, there lies the success of the film and hence it derives all the attention of the viewer. This, is how a film becomes great.Even so many years later, if this film has the charm to attract and enthrall audiences. I attribute that mostly to the narration by Kurosawa above everything else. Yes, the cinematography is brilliant, the editing is precise and makes the film breezy. The production values are good considering this is made in 1950's Japan. But above all, the treatment and the screenplay take the film to greater heights.It's the story of a woman cheating her husband and making love with another man who is a bandit. But the husband, the woman, the bandit present three versions of the story and that makes it complex. Even the witnesses give different versions of happenings and it gets intriguing further.The nature acts as a metaphor, the overcast skies, the rains and the sunshine at the end add another aspect to the narrative, which I got to know by the end. Thankfully, I observed it to grasp it.I will further examine, observe and seek learnings from Akira Kurosawa's films. For this film, a 5/5. It's a masterpiece from one of the finest directors ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The truth is out there."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rashômon is about a court proceeding, recalled in flashback, relating to a mysterious crime. A bandit, Tajômaru (Toshirô Mifune) is on trial for murdering a samurai (Mayasuki Mori) and raping his wife (Machiko Kyô) in the remote forest. Each of these three figures addresses the court, the dead man via a medium ? an amazingly, electrifying strange conceit, carried off with absolute conviction. A fourth witness (Takashi Shimura) offers his own version, again different. But it is not just a matter of the witnesses being slippery: crucially, the bandit, the samurai and the samurai's wife each claim to have committed the murderous act themselves, the samurai by suicide. Truth, history, memory and the past ? are these just fictions?One character is told that lying is natural for all of us, and it is in the discrepancies that the essence of our humanity resides. Kurosawa invests the unknowability of the event with horror, suggesting that the three of them somehow chanced upon, or created, a black hole in human thought and communication, whose confusion and violence can never be clearly explained or remembered.The movie that put Japanese cinema on the map. Unlike a traditional whodunit, events get murkier and more tangled with Kurosawa cranking up the intrigue and uncertainty as contrasting viewpoints clash. The stunning look of the movie - from the torrents of rain in the opening shots to the dappled sunlight in the forest - plays its part in making every little thing difficult to discern, backed up by forceful performances, especially from Toshiro Mifune.The genius of "Rashomon" is that all of the flashbacks are both true and false. True, in that they present an accurate portrait of what each witness thinks happened. False, because as Kurosawa observes in his autobiography, "Human beings are unable to be honest with themselves about themselves. They cannot talk about themselves without embellishing."The wonder of "Rashomon" is that while the shadow-play of truth and memory is going on, we are absorbed by what we trust is an unfolding story. The film's engine is our faith that we'll get to the bottom of things--even though the woodcutter tells us at the outset he doesn't understand, and if an eyewitness who has heard the testimony of the other three participants doesn't understand, why should we expect to?Kurosawa's screenplay is only the ground which the film travels, however. The real gift of "Rashomon" is in its emotions and visuals. The first time I saw the film, I knew hardly a thing about Japanese cinema, and what struck me was the elevated emotional level of the actors. The message of "Rashomon" is that we should suspect even what we think we have seen. This insight is central to Kurosawa's philosophy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusion and Hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Rashomon for the first time last Sunday, on Father's day; it was a good day to watch this film. The movie centers on the interpretation of a murder laced with a rape, so most of it is a dialog among three men: a woodcutter who is a witness to the crime, a monk, and a vagabond. The dialog occurs in the remains of a temple while a heavy rain falls outside. The theme of the dialog revolves around a samurai, his wife and a bandit. The bandit sees the samurai and his wife traveling through the forest, catches a glimpse of the woman's face when the breeze opens her veil, and discovers that an impetuous desire to have that woman has taken possession of his will. He catches up with the couple and through trickery ties the samurai to a tree. He then rapes the wife. So far the story is unique. The samurai dies. The woodcutter encounters his remains and reports the crime to the police. The bandit is captured and tells the jury a story of the crime. The wife tells a different story. A medium is brought up and through the medium the samurai tells a different story. And finally the woodcutter tells yet another story. There is some amazing dialog between the samurai and his wife about honor, love, and dignity. Betrayal surfaces when it is convenient to betray. While the woodcutter narrates the events to his friends, the vagabond lights a bonfire with pieces of wood he tears from the ruinous construction. The woodcutter is interrupted occasionally by his friends. The camera work in the temple is unremarkable, with plenty of close-ups of the aging and rough men. Same goes for the scenes at the courtroom. One strange point here is that we never see any magistrate. We learn about the questions because the witness repeats them. It is like the movie about the Prophet, where the camera never shows the Prophet himself. The forest scenes are much better. Since the crime is narrated four times, there is plenty of action in the forest as the samurai and the bandit fight each other. After the woodcutter finishes narrating the four different versions of the crime, including his, they hear a baby crying in a room of the temple. They find a little child wrapped in a kimono. The vagabond grabs the kimono. Despite the woodcutter's protest that the kimono had an amulet most likely left by the parents to protect the baby, the vagabond makes a bundle with the kimono and leaves the temple, as the rain ceases, disappearing down the same path where he first appeared. The monk cuddles the baby but the woodcutter asks to have the baby. The monk refuses, with indignation in his eyes. Then the woodcutter explains that he already has six children and that one more would not be much trouble. The monk hears him, and with a smile on his faces hands over the baby. The movie ends. Until then, there has not been a single instance of brotherhood in the entire movie. Until then the emotions have been on the sordid side of the human scenario: lust, envy, betrayal, deceit, murder, rape, fights, and lies. Some critics have commented that the ending is a license with sentimentality that Kurosawa allowed himself. To me, the ending is the movie. In the film, we are taken on a long trip throughout the wasteland of human feelings. Human greed and mistrust distort the truth and create confusion. From the affairs of adults emanates a toxic mist of confusion. People mistrust one another. Is there any hope? At the end, Kurosawa shows us the hope, the reason that makes one man trust another man: a future life. The human adventure is an adventure of hope. The same message is found in Sondheim and Lapine's musical Into the Woods. A marvelous musical mixing half a dozen fables that end up very happily like fables use to end. The difference is that at this stage the musical is only half way through. The other half reverses the fortunes of all players when the giant comes to town seeking revenge. Here once more all the nasty feelings seep out of the human soul. At the end, it is a little child who brings the survivors together. They decide to unite to care for the baby. So, on Father's day, with my daughter Laura I watched this great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kurosawa's magic film is a composite of 2 Japanese short stories by Ryunosuke Akutagawa: One, "Rashomon," the title tells of a confrontation of a young man at Rashomon, the large, fortified gate at one entrance to Kyoto where people would abandon children and corpses; the other, yabu no naka ni, "In a Grove," tells of the confrontation between the bandit, the samurai and his wife, told from the point of view of the woodcutter. In 1950, Kurosawa weaves this tale of human vanity and duplicity with the young Toshiro Mifune, as the bandit, Machiko Kyo as the lady and Masayuki Mori as the samurai. The tale unfolds through the flashbacks in the narration of the great Takashi Shimura as the woodcutter, supported by character actors Minoru Chiaki as the monk and Kichijiro Ueda as the bum. Basically, with a cast of six and the stark settings of a woods and a dilapidated castle gate in pouring rain, Kurosawa the magician gives us four views of human vanity, excessive pride and cultural conflict. The foibles of human needs are exposed but redeemed in the final scene where the basic act of kindness brings closure to the bizarre display of greed, lust and mendacity that has gone before. For a Kurosawa film, this one is short, to the point with an economy of emoting-- for which Mifune was never accused of under doing and the viewer is left somewhat exhausted by all the twists and turns, confused by the mix of contradictions and seeming paradox, but satisfied with a feeling of hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's Because Men Are Weak That They Lie."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From this material most filmmakers might have made a murder mystery or a courtroom drama, which is what it can fundamentally be considered to be. But Akira Kurosawa, rather, directed this universal tale made all the way across the world, set a thousand years ago, made 60 years ago, which has actually given root to philosophical movements and fields, transfiguring the account of a foul rape and murder into a contemplation on certainty and human nature. The film is about the real animal showing through the most coercive social doctrines.Beginning with a very powerful opening master shot of the Rashomon gate, two mingling time filaments construct the contemplation: Under the Rashomon gate, time lingers ponderously, breathless, exhausted, gathering dust. In the forest time is imbued with heat and disquiet, with life and respect in peril of being erased. As is widely known about the film, the stories of the rape and murder are jointly conflicting. The plot unfolds in flashback as the bandit Toshir&#x14d; Mifune, the murdered samurai Masayuki Mori, his wife Machiko Ky&#x14d;, and the nameless woodcutter Takashi Shimura recount the events of the inscrutable afternoon. But it is also a flashback within a flashback. Kurosawa first transgresses across the lapse between these two strands with a glaring two minutes of unadorned cinema which aggregates both: the woodcutter's walk into the forest, a succession of shots of constant sundry motion while the story bides its time in remission. So this scene, like those at the Rashomon gate, is chronological inertia, although its vibrancy and dormant violence, generated by its motion's rise and fall in pulse, introduces us to matters in the wood clearing. For the woodcutter's advance into the marrow of the forest, with its essentially anesthetic drift of movement per sudden cuts and camera maneuver, becomes our advance into the marrow of the film. When he stops, we are there and the forest has emerged as the focal mise en scene of the drama. However the camera proceeds to move very sparingly.The three men in the rain at the gate, comprised of Shimura's woodcutter, a traveling priest claims that he saw the samurai and the woman the same day the murder happened, and an earthy commoner, are like a Greek chorus remarking upon the turmoil in that open space. Their annotations, which throughout the film are chiefly of doubt and amazement, as the three parties in the crime each tell an extensively differing story of the death. Surprisingly, each maintains responsibility for the killing. Each telling retains the teller's honorable sense of self. Then the woodcutter gives a fourth take.Disposed to all this, some viewers consider Rashomon to be a conundrum for unriddling, upholding that there must be one correct account of the killing which we can unravel if we interpret the niceties discerningly enough. For others, Rashomon is the prototypical cinematic delineation of the philosophy that conceptions of truth and moral values are not absolute but relative, that truth is impenetrable. Indeed, we're given clues to believe each of the characters' versions of the story. There is no truth, just biased conception of events. Human beings don't tend to be capable of being candid with themselves regarding themselves. The average human cannot talk about him or herself without ornament to protect their ego. This script depicts such people, the temperament who cannot persevere without distortion to make them feel they're better people than they actually are to any objective opinion of their own. How many hypocrites do you really know? You already know you're one yourself. So am I. As animals, we're impetuous. We all have different externalizations of such behavior. What we must do to realize our significance is gain control over this characteristic.Fumio Hayasaka's slow, skin-and-bone score for Rashomon is infectious even as it's ever so subtle. This theme music is used as an exposition, associated with the presence of particular characters, and distinguishes between the inflection of tone from scene to scene. And each scene is in a class of its own. The swordfight in the bandit's recollection and the later version of the same swordfight are simply antithetical creatures. Mifune's version is a telling of rage, empowerment and humiliating the other guy. Swords clash, there are occasionally bare- knuckled struggles to reclaim a weapon, and Mifune laughing like a maniac. Later, we see even still not truly a swordfight but a fight that begins with swords in the hands of their frightened owners, who may for all we know have never before found themselves in such a fight, which devolves into a tightly aggressive mortal scuffle. Both are two of my favorite swordfights on film, no special effects are even needed! As for the scene where the husband's spectre tells the story, what other way in 11th century Japan would a court have believed they could gather all possible testimony when every survivor's account is drastically different?Kurosawa had to extemporize with sparse assets to bring it to the screen, but if anything, clenching the money clip perhaps resulted in a better film. Minimalism is indispensable to a story that depends on fine points and particulars, and the deficiency of excesses defines the discretion Kurosawa used and the rigor with which he had to work. In one sequence, there is a series of single close-ups of the bandit, then the wife, and then the husband, which then repeats to emphasize the triangular relationship. Kurosawa also peculiarly uses sunlight to actually symbolize evil and sin.Beside his remarkable instinct for what audiences wanted, there is a continuous trial-and-error strand throughout Kurosawa's work. The sense of freedom this film brought to young filmmakers was less a reaction to a mysterious thematic motif than to Kurosawa's scorn of the entrenched protocol of narrative cinema. He disregards the 180-degree rule, in so doing inverting relationships that have any extension in space, connects long shots and close-ups and shots of contradictory movements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Distinctly Resonates As Akira Kurosawa's Finest Outing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Examining Rashômon is a lengthy process, mainly due to the substantial amount of material on offer and the thought-provoking questions which should be probed subsequent to viewing. Not only does the film ask some of life's most profound questions, but it also begins to confront various evocative ideas. Essentially, Akira Kurosawa's unmatched classic is about gaining an understanding; the film's first conversation introduces characters who "don't understand" and are looking for answers, this is opening the primary theme.Personally, Rashômon has forever been favourite of Kurosawa's directional works. It also happens to be the film which introduced me to the work of an auteur; a man whose vision echoes that of a revolutionary cinematic historian. From the likes of Shichinin no samurai, to Ran, Kurosawa is *the* director of Japanese cinema. During his lifetime he managed to confirm himself as one of the world's leading film-makers. He was director who created cinema which was impossible to match, and his influence still resounds within even the most mainstream works of today. For example, the non-linear narrative structure of Rashômon has been respectfully woven in numerous films since. Rashômon was the work which propelled the career of Kurosawa; even though it was not widely regarded in its own country at the time, it was hailed by the critics of the Western world.Rashômon is the compressed tale of an innocent woman's rape and her husband's murder, performed by a ruthless bandit (acted out by Kurosawa's long-time working partner Toshirô Mifune). Even though the bandit is caught and consequently put on trial, the seemingly simple crime soon becomes questionably more complicated as it is recounted from four individually detached "eye-witness" perspectives. Posing many philosophical questions for the viewer, the picture asks which story is the one to believe (if any), through -what was at the time and still remains- a highly stylised storytelling technique. Establishing a verdict on the heinous crime centred upon in Rashômon is as much an ordeal as the crime itself because it proves to be an incident which provokes moral questioning and fierce debate.The film-making techniques used in Rashomon gave birth to a distinct style that Kurosawa was prepared to develop further in his later works, which can be seen in films such as Yojimbo and Shichinin no samurai. Level-headed pragmatism plagued Kurosawa's features throughout his earlier years; this was something that came as an advantage for his films, being that the characters (even the villains) portrayed in his films were genuine people you could feel compassion and remorse for. Also, Kurosawa began to define genres throughout the 1950s and 1960s, while also bringing to light some now-popular (often overused) methods of camera movement, e.g. dutch angles, revolving shots and amplified close-ups.For those who question the film's offbeat narrative structure, they should ask themselves whether or not the cut-throat editing is there as a means of symbolising the colliding viewpoints. I consider this to be a daring means of combining humanitarian lies and honesty, and also a means of creating a disorientating, volatile impression. With Rashômon, Kurosawa's admiration for silent cinema came into evident practice; this can be seen through the minimalist set-pieces, which are a contrast to the complex storytelling procedure that his work embodies. The ambiguity of Rashômon is detailed through subtly metaphorical cinematography and lighting techniques. I have always seen the setting of the woods as a display of the work's central atmosphere (intrigue) and the shadows periodically depicting a loss of empathy and symbolising the isolated danger of the surroundings.The majority of films fail to emphasise with the viewer, this can blamed on the morals being "mixed" and ultimately enabling the viewer to become unsure of a film's statement. However, with Rashômon the morals are clear and refined, without being preachy or simplistic. Summing up the greed, confusion, deprivation and indulgence of the world is a tricky business, but somehow Kurosawa has the ability to perform such a task with exceeding talent. Rashômon warrants a right to be hailed as a definitive classic. Unlike its story, I doubt that viewers of Rashômon hold clashing opinions, being that it is far too flawless to be argued over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Ferocity of Men"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rashomon is a movie based off of the short stories "Rashomon" and "In a Grove." It is the story of a bandit who leads a couple into the woods, ties the man up, and rapes the woman. Somehow the man ends up dead, but there are differing theories as to how this happened. The movie takes place on a rainy day when two men are discussing how much this story confuses them. A third man shows up and asks what they are talking about. The story is told from the perspectives of the bandit, the wife, the husband, and a woodcutter who saw the whole thing. It is then up to the men to decide whether or not humanity is inherently evil, or if there is a glimmer of kindness in men.This movie is all about how humans lie, cheat, and steal to impress others or to make themselves feel better, and to gain an advantage over others. Since there are four differing accounts, at least three, and maybe all four, of the storytellers are lying. Each character gains something by lying. The bandit portrays himself as an honorable man who challenges the husband to a sword fight instead of killing him in a deceptive way. The wife says she does not remember murdering her husband, thus distancing herself from some of the blame, and then proceeds to say that she was so struck with guilt that she tried to commit suicide. The husband says that his wife only betrayed him because she was brainwashed by the bandit, and that he was so grief-stricken that he killed himself. And finally, the woodcutter lied to the police so he would not have to get involved, and lied to the two men to cover up the fact that he stole the woman's expensive dagger. All four of these characters are selfish; Tajomaru is a rapist, the woodcutter is a thief, and any of the four could be the killer, including the husband himself. The movie portrays humans as horrible, self-centered creatures, and the story even causes a priest to lose his faith in humanity for a while.However, the movie also shows hope for the plight of men. At the end of the movie, a baby is abandoned. It is left all alone on that rainy day, unable to take care of itself. But the woodcutter, who already has six children, agrees to take the baby home and raise it as his own. He has given this child a second chance at life, and has restored the priest's faith in the kindness of humanity.The movie was black and white, somewhat repetitive, and slow-moving. I do not recommend it to anyone who has a problem with those things. Because of the rape, it is a mature film and not for children. It is also pretty depressing and up until the very end, shows only the negative aspects of people. But overall, I thought it was a pretty good movie about human nature, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the darker side of people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The quest for the truth and the human soul !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rash&#x14d;mon was probably the first genuine masterpiece that the master Akira Kurosawa made in his career. I had watched it for the first time about 4 or 5 years ago. My eyes weren't as polished and my mind wasn't as perceptive back then as it is now from a cinematic standpoint. So when I watched it back then, I remember being impressed by the whole concept of the same incident being narrated by people in completely different manners in an attempt to manipulate others. But I had certainly not grasped everything else that enriches this absolutely masterful piece of work. Now on my second viewing, I noticed the multiple layers, the themes, and the meaning behind the film.The film as I have mentioned before deals with different versions of the same incident. The film starts out with a woodcutter and a priest sitting beneath the Rash&#x14d;mon city gate to stay away from the heavy rainfall. Suddenly a stranger comes along and becomes suspicious of these two quiet men. Then the woodcutter and the priest decide to tell him what has made them so very depressed and the film's main plot proceeds. The main story is about a murder that takes place. The persons involved in the murder come back to get interrogated about it. Each of them narrate the incident differently. Interestingly we never see the interrogator and hence it seems as if the characters are answering questions and narrating the incident directly to the viewer. This was a thematic break of the 4th wall. Each version paints a good and desired impression of the narrator in the viewer's mind, but a neutral account of the incident might make the viewer question the morality of every character involved. One of the main aspects of this film that is so impressive is the cinematography. The camera effortlessly follows the characters while they walk through the forest in the most serene way possible. Kurosawa succeeds in conveying so much with the most subtle things. The shadow of the leaves fluttering gently on the face of Mifune, the sun desperately trying to make its way through the bushy trees, but failing to do so signifying the truth not being allowed to come to the forefront by the characters, the half damaged city gate, the relentless rain signifying the relentless nature of disasters and calamities,etc.The film is much more endearing and important from a broader perspective. One has to consider the fact that Rash&#x14d;mon got released in 1950, so just a few years after the devastating World War II. After the disastrous consequences of that war, Japan and the Japanese society was going through an indefinite spell of misery and hopelessness. This film deals with that hopelessness in the most humanist manner possible. Rash&#x14d;mon really is about existentialism beneath the seemingly simple outer surface. The film deals with the question-whether we should lose all hope and faith in humanity or not after considering and even witnessing all the heinous crimes and immoral deeds that human beings are capable of. The priest and the woodcutter seriously consider losing faith in the human soul after listening to the incident of the murder and everything that followed with the interrogations. But even in the midst of this hopelessness, Kurosawa manages to end the film in the most heart-wrenching and optimistic manner to give hope and a reason to start believing again to not only the Japanese people, but also to the viewers from the rest of the world. Rash&#x14d;mon is just an essential, transcendental film in the history of cinema that needs to be watched by everyone who is interested in film as an art form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that introduced western audiences to Japanese cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While not my favourite Akira Kurasawa(for not only Japan's greatest director, but one of the finest directors there was) film, like Seven Samurai closely followed by Ran, Rashomon is still a fantastic film. No Kurasawa film is the same without great scenery and cinematography, and Rashomon is no disappointment in that regard. The camera is always moving but never feels like too much due to how subtly composed they (and the editing) are, and the scenery especially the beautifully lit jungle is just as striking, not as epic as Seven Samurai but still making its mark. The music, though I may prefer Ran's score when it comes to scores for Kurasawa's films, is always fitting with the mood and atmosphere of the film, and with its exploration of the relativity of truth the four accounts of the woodland encounter between a bandit and a wealthy couple is written in a compelling and completely credible manner. Kurasawa's direction as ever is superb, as are the performances of Machiko Kyo and Toshiru Mifune. Overall, a truly remarkable film. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a remarkable film, an exercise in straightforward storytelling that nonetheless remains elliptical at its conclusion. The dense symbolism of the film is in evidence form the first frame, with two Godot-like figures sheltering from a rainstorm in the ruin of a traditional Japanese building. A third, hobo-fool character passes through and gets them to discuss their preoccupation. It's nothing to do with the building or the weather though - their fettered speech is because they have heard four different versions of the same awful crime.All four accounts get played out in flashback, interspersed with tableaux from the court which hears them (we, the audience, sit as police). The accounts are melodramatic, often rather funny (largely through Toshirô Mifune's manic laughter as the bandit Tajômaru). The stories and their staging occur in bright sunlight and its concomitant, high-contrast shadow, which becomes a dappled net of light and shade in the grove of the crime. Disturbingly the accounts all contradict each other; crucially this contradiction is shifts the blame-apportion but barely changing the outcome. Instead, the tragedy transfers to those in the present who cannot grip the perspective of dishonesty and tragedy, or what it means.I see Rashomon as a fresh-minted parable, old period &amp; characters narrating and acting out a story for modern, hurting Japan, which was emerging from the trauma of post-war shame and suffering. The conclusion is complex, but not ambivalent: the woodcutter, though stripped of confidence, reason and moral relativity retains an irreducible grip on his humanity, enough to carry the future of Japan out into the new sun. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Theme of the Picture....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A host of reviewers seem to think this movie is questioning the nature of truth or of reality. Perhaps the late director Robert Altman said it best in his introduction to the Criterion Collection DVD: "....the proper conclusion (is) that all of it's true, and none of it's true." According to this school of thought, Kurosawa's film speaks powerfully to the postmodern consciousness--in effect telling us that there is no such thing as objective truth or objective reality.Nonsense. Many of these reviewers wonder at the inclusion of an "epilogue" in the movie--the bit with the baby at the very end--saying that it is unnecessary, but doesn't necessarily detract from the movie. It is no wonder: if the movie is trying to tell us that absolute truth does not exist or that reality is completely subjective, there is no need for this "epilogue." If that is what the movie is about, there is, in fact, very little need for anything but the stories of the participants/eyewitnesses. But the movie cannot be telling us that objective truth does not exist or that the nature of reality is insuperably perspectival, for underlying the competing truth claims and the varying perspectives on reality are hard, undeniable facts: a man is dead, and his wife has been had by another man, and each of three people testified in court that he or she murdered the dead man. These are presented as facts that are undeniably true.The movie is ultimately about mankind: we are evil, so corrupted by our own selfishness that we can't tell the truth to or about ourselves. This was an important consideration for the humanist Kurosawa, for as his priest says, "If people cannot trust each other, this world might as well be hell"--in other words, why go on living if humanity is so incorrigible? The priest's problem is intended to be our own as we watch this movie: Throughout the movie, it is the priest's faith in mankind, his belief that life is worth living, that is tried--you never see him wondering if anything can be said to be "true" or ultimately "real." He, like us, believes at first that the woodcutter may be a "good man," or at least trustworthy, but the man is human, and is shown to be an unreliable storyteller.Funnily enough, it is the same woodcutter who, in this particular story, is supposed to give us a reason to continue living. We know that man is incorrigible, that he can't do anything but be deceitful (at least to some degree), even about himself. Can there thus be any reason to think that this world is any better than a hell? Yes, says Kurosawa. The hope for man is in the kind of compassionate action displayed by the woodcutter in adopting the abandoned baby. As long as man can show compassion to his fellows, man can consider living to be a worthwhile endeavor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching movies for several decades, i still get puzzled which of them have been considered masterpieces. In this sense, Rashomon epitomizes everything i don't understand about cinema.Judging by the literature, Kurosawa drew part of his inspiration from classical Russian writers. In order to be on par with their Russian role-models, artists often feel the urge to make their work slow-paced and lengthy. For the average viewer this usually means boring. And we see that in Rashomon's long shots during which there is absolutely nothing going on.As far as acting is concerned, let's just say that Toshiro Mifune's delivery is too theatrical even for the time of movie's creation.There might be a discussion on various levels about Rashomon, but the bottom line is that it's an overrated piece of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this film for a film history class, and I have a somewhat ambivalent reaction to it. I recognize the qualities that make it great, in terms of the theme (i.e.--a visual examination of the subjectivity of knowledge), but their are aspects of the cinematography that are very off-putting for a 21st century American audience. Most notable are the exceptionally long takes focused on an actor's face while he/she emotes for the camera. After the first few seconds of this type of shot, no new intelligence is communicated by continuing to view the actor's face. I did like the realism of the fight scenes, which struck me as much more in line with reality than the highly choreographed demonstrations of virtuoso sword-play that many more modern action films offer. Overall, I give the film a 3, based on the fact that it's just not all that accessible to most modern viewers, due to differences in culture and aesthetic values between 1950 Japan and 2004 America. Since the purpose of any text is to reach out in a meaningful way to its audience, that inaccessibility constitutes a fatal flaw in the film. In other words, it's dated, badly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RASHOMON is a film that is much more than just a cinema. Its footprints in literature, psychology and philosophy are simply indelible. I will be focusing only on film. At first glance, the film is exotic. Kurosawa's films are like that. However, the exotic in this case is reflected in the simple set design, the beauty of picture and sound, emotional acting appearance and excellent close-ups. The essence lies in the fact that the audience is not used to this kind of movies. I am one of those who are enthusiastic.Horrible event narrated with four different point of view, none of which may not be true. Although the point of view of similar and tragic at the same time are thematically different. This is not about rationalization but the understanding of human nature. Kurosawa took the burden to the public to provide answers to these questions and in this down to the darkest depths of the human soul.Why do people lie to themselves and everyone else? I think that any suggestion or an individual assessment of the film does not give much room for optimism. The beginning of the film we just all talk. Three wandering the ruined house hidden from the rain. The country is devastated, people disappointed and full of mistrust.It is interesting that a film, which is so focused on human nature acts like a fairytale, tense and wild at the same time. This is truly a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Rashômon"(1950) is an interesting story about a crime which is being told (and seen by the viewers) from different perspectives while being "modificated" in a process. It's interesting movie, which kinda doesn't have a clear outcome in my opinion, and as director said himself, this is how life works - not everything always is clear. At running time 1 h 28 min. this movie surprisingly doesn't drag and it's very well paced. The one complain i have about this movie is Toshirô Mifune acting. Was it just me or did e really overacted? I found it kinda annoying, but that's probably was his style, nevertheless, this is not a real acting and more of a theatrical performance. Overall, although "Rashômon" was made 65 years ago, it's still holds up for is ideas, inventive and intriguing storytelling,well pacing and very good script. It's a bit hard to watch a movie in 2015 which was created in 1950, but you can definitely see this one, it's really good movie.</fullReview>

JUST WOW !! this movie TERRIFIC !!before i watch it, im not expect too much. i think seventh samurai will be better than this. first scene start with a priest and a tramp talking "i really don't understand" with a deep emotion. holy mother.. that act was really convincing ! then im definitely sure this movie gonna be great just after i watched that first scene. that day was raining hard, so they need to take shelter at a shrine called rashomon. then you know what, the art-direction (decoration) of that abandoned shrine is REALLY Unbelievable !! that was a professional decoration in 1950 ! a few times later, another tramp come. the other two tell a story which even they don't understand. then the Fabulous STORY HAS BEGAN !!! that story about a murder in the woods who found by the tramp. the story is not important at all and you all will find its solution really easy to predict, not like our crime-magician David fincher. but don't get it wrong, the photography was damn GENIUS ! MAN, IT WAS 1950 AND SOMEBODY ALREADY MASTERED THE USE OF A TERRIFYING ART OF PHOTOGRAPHY !!! if you know what i mean, that scene when the wife looking into the water at the river. holy motherrr, that lightning set was BEAUTIFUL. all the action scene when the husband and the bandit, its like they use a real sword, they slash everything and it is all damaged over there and there. i really feels like Unbelievable ! yet the camera movement and the position they took shot of the camera, it was near perfect as a well-made movie. and the cutting time skill from the director, oh my god ! all was beyond imagination, it is too fkng pro, even director nowadays still not reach that level but this man did in 1950 ! i even didn't believe japan have this legend director in their history. all that i know, japan was really good with their animated movies likes spirited away, grave of the fireflies, etc (these movies too rich and really dense yet out-of-the-box, surprisingly creative !the other things that i like from this movie were the fabulous act, they all totality on their own. all the emotion was acted excellently with japan style of act. yet what makes this movie considered as one of the most influental movie was it's richness of the story/plot. the ending was not the best, but that keeps the viewer had their own answer to it. this movie tells to us, human is WEAK ! we all live for evildoing. we all sinner. they show us ourself, this is what we are. and in the end, we are trying to change to be better person in our life also for the other's life. that's how to live our life !maybe this movie is not for young/kid/teenager who prefer a vibrant action or old-crime style. but for those who enjoy movies not for it's entertaining category or it's magical visual effect. for those people who can see a movie as it is, as how the movie made with good directing and cinematography which contains everything. you will find something that surprisingly unbelievable, and it is what professional movie- maker called it as ART, GREAT ART.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A heinous crime and its aftermath are recalled from differing points of view. A priest, a woodcutter and another man are taking refuge from a rainstorm in the shell of a former gatehouse called Rashomon. The priest and the woodcutter are recounting the story of a murdered samurai whose body the woodcutter discovered three days earlier in a forest grove. Both were summoned to testify at the murder trial, the priest who ran into the samurai and his wife traveling through the forest just before the murder occurred. Three other people who testified at the trial are supposedly the only direct witnesses: a notorious bandit named Tajômaru, who allegedly murdered the samurai and raped his wife; the white veil cloaked wife of the samurai; and the samurai himself who testifies through the use of a medium. The three tell a similarly structured story - which Tajômaru kidnapped and bound the samurai so that he could rape the wife - but which ultimately contradict each other, the motivations and the actual killing being what differ. Rashomon was a milestone in cinematic history, it is a masterpiece from a masterful storyteller. Who do you believe? The film gives you four different stories and lets you choose which one is the truth, it is like a puzzle to the viewer all during the film you are trying to make up your mind to whom is guilty. It is a deeply intelligent and complex but captivating and intriguing film at the same time. Rashomon is one of very films you must see in your lifetime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has a lot in common with movies that turn out to be a dream in which the main character wakes up to realize that what just happened never occurred. I find those kinds of pictures less than satisfying because they seem to cop out of a final resolution to the story. "Rashomon" takes a somewhat similar approach, but instead of setting up a dream narrative, Kurosawa has his characters relate the circumstances of a murder from the perspective of four different observers. I can't say that that isn't a valid approach, but the problem I have is that the characters relating their stories don't seem to have credibility on their side. If I had to make a personal judgment, I'd say the woodcutter's appraisal of events seemed most valid because he didn't have a personal stake in the outcome of a murder investigation.Looking individually at each of the players - the bandit Tajomaru (Toshiro Mifune) relates a tale that builds up his own self esteem - he valiantly fights the husband (Masayuki Mori), crossing swords with him twenty three times. The wife (Machiko Kyo) relating her version of events seems to be seeking atonement for her shame in being victimized by Tajomaru. The husband, telling his story through a medium after his death, seems willing to spare his wife the agony of betrayal and for suffering the shame of her rape. Finally, the woodcutter, who has nothing to gain by telling what he saw, except for the possible humiliation for not intervening because he was cowardly, was probably the closest to the truth about what happened. But we'll never know because the truth, which lies in the eye of the beholder, can potentially shift and change with each viewing of the film.It will probably take some more viewings of the movie for me to gain a greater appreciation of it. As with "Seven Samurai", I find Kurosawa's pacing to be drawn out more than necessary; note the long time it took for the woodcutter to make his way to the scene of the crime in his version of the story. I'm also put off by the histrionics of a character like Tojomaru, who's over the top and manic delivery make him seem out of control. Granted, these are matters of preference with me, so I look at them somewhat like the players in the film who have their own biases in telling their story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a scientific study called "Rashomon Effect". You could say this film is that good, plus given the circumstances of the making in 1950s. Alas the film work alone deserves the spotlight.We all can think of our own "Rashomon" experiences from our lives. People can be believing in a same event in different ways. They would tell similar yet different stories.This might sound a cliché, but sometimes there can be no absolute truth of one thing. Things could happen to have its different perspectives subjectively. So it leads to a problem that if we can blame someone that he/she lied because another person is telling differently. They all might be genuinely thinking to themselves that they're telling the truth.Aside the well known quotes of this film, I also liked the quote: " ... I even heard that the demon living here in Rashomon fled in fear of the ferocity of man."By the way, Homer Simpson says he liked Rashomon. Although he remembers it differently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You just need to watch Rashomon to understand why Akira Kurosawa is considered one of the finest directors in world cinema. For most of the viewers, it is an unsolved crime told in an interesting yet different fashion, and he/she can try to arrange the puzzles to form a solution. For movie freaks, it is much more than that; in addition to being a fine work of art, it conveys beautifully a simple message through a complex movie.One can easily gather from the movie, that the main idea conveyed was that there is no absolute truth. We see 4 different people narrating a story, in completely different ways. While each of them tells their version of the story, the idea expressed is simply how much one's perspective can distort reality. Or in the deeper sense, that there is no absolute reality. Reality is relative. We could relate it to the story of the blind men and an elephant, where 6 different blind men touch different parts of an elephant and each of them assume, interpret and argue that elephant looks like the part they touched.Now, probably to what was mainly conveyed through the movie - the rationale behind the different stories. None of them were lying to protect themselves, as one can notice from the bandit's and the lady's story, they say they might have killed the samurai. Obviously, protection from law is not what mattered. In the bandit's story, he glorified himself; he portrayed himself as a brave and a great warrior, who easily lures the lady. In the lady's story, she portrayed herself as a helpless victim, trying to stand in dignity. In the samurai's version, he was portrayed as being noble, brave, and the best thing he could do was committing suicide. In the woodcutter's version, he is portraying each of the 3 characters equally culpable, which makes his act of stealing the dagger a trivial one. Even though, we tend to go with the woodcutter's story because he is a neutral person, we cannot believe his as well, as he was the only person who admitted that he was lying (earlier).In each of the version, we see that the person is glorifying themselves. It is not protection from law that mattered, but protecting one's own ego. In every one's story, we see the story-teller polishing his character so as to suit his ego. It portrays the insecurity in humans, the fact that no humans can survive without lying to themselves and creating a make-belief world where they seem to be a better person than they actually are. A simple message that no human is completely honest with himself! Other than the message conveyed in the movie, the way in which the movie unfolds, the way the characters are molded, the way the 3 characters differ in the different versions, the acting, the sensuality of the woman, all plays a great role in shaping the movie into a masterpiece. For instance, the initial scene in which the woodcutter walks through the forest till he finds the dead body is breathtaking. We walk with him, and when he stands still seeing the body, we also freeze. Even such a trivial scene, shot with amazing beauty and intelligence, is what makes Kurosawa one among the best! Usually, when a movie ends without a climax, or when no solutions are provided to the crime, I end up a bit frustrated (exception being Nolan's inception). Have to admit though, this one left me fascinated!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is truth?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rainy day? Need something to ponder upon? Then take a seat at one of the stairs of the Rashomon gate and listen to a particularly strange murder mystery. But be aware upfront that this is not about the culprit, as you'll hear several confessions, but all won't match. Who's lying? Why? Is it all intentional? Or due to different perceptions? Are people cheating on themselves as well? For their own good, for the sake of accepting reality, or because they are adhering to a principle they consider superior? What is real? What is true? Is it possible at all to understand? Thus are the questions posed under the Rashomon. But that we cannot grasp it is exactly the point.Kurosawa's version of Akutagawa's tale "In a Bomboo Grove" doesn't shun from irritating the audience by presenting various accounts of the same story without providing a satisfying resolution. With the abandoning of the conventional, objective narrative form he opened the door to distortions of reality shown on screen, broadening the horizons of what a camera can convey, adding another level of sophistication to the medium. Dismissed by the studio he was working for as incomprehensible, Kurosawa's "Rashomon" however hit the western film world like a bomb. With the prizes it won it would become the gateway that opened Japanese cinema to the rest of the world and establish Kurosawa as a director to reckon with. Yet it is not only the fresh idea that makes "Rashomon" different - music and sound undoubtedly are highly effective, but the exceptionally strong point of the film is that it offers flawless cinematography by Kazuo Miyagawa, who would later also shoot Mizogushi's appraised pearls "Sansho the Bailiff" and "Ugetsu". And of course "Rashomon" already has Kurosawa's future key player Toshiro Mifune as the bandit, who borrows with his extreme expressions from the silent era, and this intensity of acting makes a film about reality in question even more stirring. Good cinema should ask questions, and rarely it is done as masterful as here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to view "Rashomon"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people have written about "Rashomon" and debated the plot, what "really" happened, who was telling the truth, whether the complete truth is ever told, etc. I think it's possible to state an uncontradictory account of the actual event (which I don't want to describe in detail, as I want to avoid writing a spoiler). The thing to ask yourself, while watching the film,is this: What is the motivation of each character? Each story reveals that person's deepest fear. In the story each person tells, they are trying to protect the one thing they are most afraid of losing. Given this perspective, I find the film is actually quite understandable and makes a lot of sense. One other comment I'd like to make is that Kurosawa-san once said, "Women are not my specialty." I beg to differ! The wife's emotion is so very real, certainly just as real as the men's. I could name my favorite women characters in his other films too...but that might wander outside the scope of this review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Says Who?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 9th-century Japan, a couple of men are sheltering from the pouring rain in a ruined temple called Rashomon. A woodcutter tells the story of a samurai's dead body he found in the woods three days earlier. The murderer was evidently a notorious bandit (Toshiro Mifune) who is captured and brought to trial.Mifune admits to an unseen court that he tied up the samurai and then raped the guy's wife in front of him. The problem is that the wife responded enthusiastically. When Mifune tries to leave, she begs him to kill her husband and get rid of the witness to her dishonor. Mifune releases the samurai, there is a sword fight, the samurai is killed, and when Mifune looks around, the wife is gone.The wife's testimony contradicts Mifune's. After the rape, Mifune leaves and the wife weeps abundantly as she crawls to her husband and begs his forgiveness. His response is only a cold, silent stare, filled with loathing. She implore him to kill her, then, and scuttles towards him with her dagger in hand. Then she faints. When she wakes up, her husband is dead, with her dagger in his chest.The samurai husband testifies through a spooky medium that both stories are false. When he was finally free, both the bandit and his own wife had disappeared, and he killed himself with the dagger.The woodcutter who is recounting the testimony says all the stories are baloney because he, the woodcutter, was a silent witness. He didn't testify at the trial because he didn't want to get involved. HIS story sounds like the real one because, uninvolved as he was, he has nothing to gain from lying about the events.But, no. One of the other men brings up a discrepancy that casts doubt on the woodcutter's story too.We're not used to these kinds of stories. We don't know how to DO them the way Kurosawa did on a tiny budget. (It was remade with Paul Newman as "Outrage" and was a boring failure.) If it were made today, it would be filled with Uzis and exploding fireballs but in the original the only thing overdone is the acting, which is highly stylized.You can overanalyze a thing. In this case we can take a nose dive into phenomenology and all that, but what such an analysis would remind me of is the early 1960s, before intuition began to guide our experience of the world, when some people still sat around on the floor with candles in the chianti bottles and asked each other what Truth was.The fact is this movie can be boiled down to even simpler propositions. Here's one. "Everybody's memory is flawed." Here's another: "It's flawed in ways that exculpate us." I'm not arguing that Kurosawa didn't have more in mind that that, but just that the movie can be appreciated by people who didn't major in philosophy. We all have different views of reality. That's a relatively simple fact that everyone will agree on.And we don't have to look far for instances. "I did not have sexual relations with that woman." "We know how many there are and where they are." "I use a wide stance." Well, this may not be everybody's cup of green tea. The rape isn't very explicit. There is no nudity. Nobody's guts gush out of his abdomen. The ghost acts like a decerebrate feline preparation. Not a curse word in the dialog. It's in black and white. No elaborate sets. And it uses subtitles. (I can hear the cry now -- "Hey, this thing's in Chinese!") It may not stimulate anyone's gonads but it may tickle his higher reasoning centers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rashômon is one of legendary director Akira Kurosawa's (Seven Samurai, Yojimbo) great works of art. It is a dark and cynical outlook on mankind and it's morality and integrity. It is the story of the murder of a man and the rape of his wife, told from four different perspectives. Each perspective contradicts the others and it is left to the audience's interpretation as to who told the truth. Rashômon was the first film to utilize the telling of the same story from different perspectives and that technique has now become a staple in creative filmmaking. It is used in many different films such as Vantage Point (2008), The Usual Suspects (1995), and even the animated film Hoodwinked! (2005). It is for this reason that you absolutely cannot say that Rashômon is not an influential film.Akira Kurosawa is highly acclaimed to be one of the greatest directors who ever lived, and his skills in cinematography and art direction never fail to amaze. Rashômon is no exception. It is beautifully shot in its three settings the entire movie takes place in. It is this intelligent and immaculate direction which captivates and awes you, as you try and decipher the mystery taking place. The story is not complex on the surface but it is the intriguing themes and motifs that Kurosawa explores that make Rashômon an experience that makes you think. Nothing in the film is set straight and it is all up to viewer interpretation.Rashômon is an excelling work of art, yet a few things must be taken into account to truly understand where the film comes from. It was made in 1950's Japan, a very different time with a very different culture. The filming and acting techniques are noticeably different than modern filmmaking is used to. At times the acting seems very overdone and melodramatic, but you have to take into account the time period. Also the portrayal of women in this film could be looked upon sorely, but this is likely a cultural thing which can't be understood without the proper research. These "issues" are hardly minor gripes and can't really be considered legitimate thing to complain about.Rashômon is influential filmmaking at it's best. What Kurosawa explores in this film are things that will stand the test of time and make Rashômon a classic film by a legendary director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Master director Akira Kurosawa released his classic RASHOMON in 1950, and became forever Asian cinema's number one represent. It's a mystery-tale playing like a crime-novel told through five different point-of-views and outplaying on three locations (the Rashomon-house, in the forest, and in court), and the film shows the relativity of truth. The scenes from inside the court involves the viewer, all of the characters are placed directly in front of the camera, addressing themselves - it's like we're the jury, deciding what to believe in, and not. Shot in B&amp;W Kurosawa uses the lighting in the forest in interesting ways, the sunlight that shines through the treetops adverts to the hazy story - faces and situations are partly covered in shadow, and light up by sun. What actually happened, and what's fictitious? And Kurosawa uses many techniques to unveil the plot; the dreamy score, the bandit-character (Toshiro Mifune) is a raucous, beastly troublemaker with farcical acrobatics, long sequences with no sound shows Kurosawa's love for the silent era, the non-linear narrative and the uplifting climax. RASHOMON shows different versions of reality, and Kurosawa pioneered using the camera subjectively.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something Special Was On Its Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fascinating film. It is one that is based on multiple accounts of an event that takes place in a forest in Japan. A man is traveling with his young wife when they are set on by a bandit (Toshiro Mifume). The man is killed and the woman escapes after being raped by the bandit. The story then becomes a series of four accounts of the events of that day. Each of the participants, including the murdered man gets to describe what took place. It is a story about the sorry state of humanity, but it is more about the Japanese culture. What takes place is hard for a Westerner to really comprehend. Given those circumstances, death, rather than shame, becomes a central issue in the film. Once the woman is raped, her status as a human being is diminished tremendously. She becomes the baggage of the man who wants her. It is totally captivating to see each of the figures tell his or her story. This technique has been used in many TV shows and movies (I remember a show called Petrocelli, years ago where it was the lifeblood of the show), but nowhere is it done better. There is a very positive ending as well where a sense of redemption is left with the viewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've wanted to watch this since I first found out it existed. This is the second Kurosawa feature I've seen, the first being Seven Samurai. The man certainly was an artist. The concept smoothly avoids being a gimmick, as it could easily have turned into in the hands of someone not sufficiently talented, and is instead a well-used device, through which base human emotions and responses are explored, as well as relationships, good and evil, and more. Any piece of expression that so skillfully encourages its audience to think - without ever seeming like a lecture - should be respected and appreciated. The story-telling is excellent. The acting is spot-on, from all involved. The minimal cast and amount of settings are well-utilized, and keeps the focus sharp. The plot never loses the viewers' interest, and in fact only gets increasingly deep and fascinating as it goes. While the subject of this is a sexual crime, the way it's handled is immensely tasteful. The visuals are impeccable, and cinematography and editing are amazing. This could arguably, along with much of Hitchcock's work, be cited as the origins of the utter tidal wave of "twist endings"(often overshadowing all else about those movies, including, but not limited to, consideration being put into ensuring that said surprise even makes sense) that have hit popular cinema in recent years, however, milestones sometimes do cause negatives, and they shouldn't be blamed for that. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys being challenged, and is willing to give the medium of film the chance to prove itself as possessing the potential to be a form of art. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched Rashomon for the first time yesterday. Although I've seen plenty of Japanese movies in the past, this is the first Akira Kurosawa movie I've ever seen.The first thing that stands out when watching the movie is the direction and cinematography which looks well ahead of its time, like the shots where the camera occasionally points towards the sun. As the story begins to unfold, the next obvious thing we notice is the innovative premise of the film, now known in academic circles as the "Rashomon effect", where several witnesses give different interpretations of what happened at a scene.The best performance in the movie was definitely from Toshiro Mifune in one of his first major roles. Whether he was over-the-top earlier on or more subtle and realistic later on, his performance was incredibly versatile.After I finished watching the film, I was initially a bit disappointed that the film didn't spoon-feed us with a final answer, but I've realized that this is exactly what makes it such a thought-provoking movie. Now I'm really looking forward to watching Kurosawa's other most famous movie, The Seven Samurai.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Path breaking cinema if you may permit me to call considering the fact that it was made in 1950. Very creative of Mr. Kurosawa of breaking away from the norm and invent something new totally unheard/ unseen. I bet the audience were confused when they watched it back in 1950 as one would today.The cast is perfect (and fat-free, meaning bare-minimum cast!). The changes they bring about in the emotions for each segments is commendable. My favourite segment: the last! Even though a 90-minutes movie, it appears to be a bit slow probably because you watch the plot churned out 4-times and the boredom tends to set in. Or perhaps because its 1950's movie? Regardless, it can be safely overlooked.The director attempts to convey one message thru the movie namely "Perspective".PS: Definitely qualifies for one of the "must-watch" movies before you die!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rashomon Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boasting a rich and greatly impacting heir of Buddhist ideals as significant to this day as they were sixty years ago, Rashomon stands alone as one of the great classics of film history. This Japanese masterpiece carefully sculpts the stories of a samurai and his wife's encounter with a bandit within in a small grove. Rashomon skillfully bounces back and forth between the incidents as told by all parties involved. One of the most striking features of this film is the way in which Akira Kurosawa avoids ever establishing a clear main character in the film. This is done to truly raise the more earthly aspects of the film such as nature and the society as a whole. This practice is further implemented through the cinematography of Rashomon as the camera chooses to frame long and distant shots most of the time to convey the importance of the environment opposed to the characters individually.Kurosawa's cast is all guilty of overacting their parts throughout the film but it comes across as completely acceptable given the context of the film. Toshiro Mifune, in his role as the bandit, is especially hard to watch throughout his animated performance of his character. Mifune plays the part as a cartoon which gives into his inhuman nature as an evil antagonist to the samurai and his wife. Rashomon backtracks over itself many times in order to tell the story as different characters had seen it happen. Although this practice typically will slow down the narrative in a film, within the context of this story it truly helps to push the plot forward due to clever editing decisions.Rashomon is a remarkably beautiful film to watch because of its well crafted directing, its wholesome Japanese themes, and the one-of-a-kind cinematography used throughout. The movie is rich with the present culture of 1950's Japan and it is a blessing to see everything move so freely together as each scene blends into one another in the passing of this film. Rashomon is beyond an ordinary film, this is an experience and an experience that should be watched by all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimate dismissal of objective truth...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I oftentimes wonder, upon seeing classic films like this, what the atmosphere would have been like in a 1950s movie theatre that had just shown the film. I would imagine that viewers would have experienced the same feelings that I experienced after watching ground-breaking visual spectacles such as THE MATRIX and mind-warping thrillers such as MEMENTO.This film was lauded at that time (1950) for its stunning visual appeal and epic footage. Watching it in today's high-tech world it is a bit difficult to imagine this as cutting-edge, but one thing remains outstandingly clear: this is yet another one of Akira Kurosawa's brilliant stories.The story itself is relatively simple by today's standards, yet there is a pervasive air of complexity that surrounds the film long after its 88 minute run-time. The simple story is told and re-told from four different perspectives, as can be read in any generic plot summary. The problem (and fascination) here is that no two stories are the same, and they all conflict with each other. What's even more perplexing is that the fourth story is told form a neutral point of view and it should therefore be easier for the viewer to believe this recreation, but having seen the initial three scenarios (each of which are equally credible), it is hard to buy into even this final telling.But forget the story, because this film is so much more than just that. This is a film that focuses on truths, untruths, and perspective, all told in a beautifully poetic way. To the viewer, the camera should not lie. The camera is the viewer's perspective into the on-screen world. As such, the camera serves as the viewer's viewpoint and should therefore be totally and objectively honest. It is by such means that people watch movies. However, in this relatively short motion picture, the camera 'lies' to the viewer on at least three occasions, and in the end the viewer is left questioning subjective truth versus objective truth. Many of the core principles are the same as in MEMENTO...that there is no such thing as an objective truth or objective memory. All events are dependent on the observer, and are hence subjective. Indeed, this is a film that has, and will continue to, spark many intellectual conversations/arguments.As with the meticulous Kurosawa, the storytelling and screenplay is marvellous. It is hard to judge the musical aspect of the film simply because it is difficult to compare it to today's standards. All I can say here is that the music appears to 'fit' the movie well. The acting is top notch, and special mention should be paid to Kurosawa's mainstay Toshiro Mifune, as well as Minuro Chiaki, who plays the role of the melancholy priest exceptionally well. My vote for the best actor, however, has to go to Machiko Kyo, who competently takes on a different personality in each version of the story.While some people find it hard to watch classic movies such as this, I recommend that you see this at least once. It may just be one of the more rewarding 88-minute cinematic experiences you will ever have.3.5 stars, 8/10. Should enter my Top 150 at about 115. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I don't understand my own soul."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa is unquestionably the most recognised film-making talent ever to emerge from Japan, his string of reputed masterpieces including 'The Seven Samurai (1954),' 'Yojimbo (1961)' and 'Ran (1985),' each of which I have yet to enjoy, my experience with Asian cinema worryingly limited. After recently enjoying my first Kurosawa picture, the powerful but slightly-overlong 'Nora inu / Stray Dog (1949),' I was keen to watch another, though I couldn't yet find the time to commit myself to one of the director's three-hour-long epics. 'Rashômon (1950)' proved the perfect alternative. Kurosawa's film, the first to bring him into the international limelight, uses a simple story ? of a husband's death in the woods ? to reveal a simple but worryingly-accurate truth of human existence: that the truth itself is unknowable. The unique narrative structure of the film, of replaying the same event four times from differing perspectives, had the potential to become nothing more than a curious gimmick, yet Kurosawa makes it all work wonderfully, aided by the exquisite cinematography of Kazuo Miyagawa and electric performances from all involved, most particularly Kurosawa-regular Toshirô Mifune.The film opens in a bleak, bitter rainstorm ? one of those mighty skyward torrents that makes us drought-stricken Australians green with envy ? where three men are sheltering in the ruins of a gatehouse. Three days previously, the oldest of the three, Woodcutter (Takashi Shimura), discovered the body of a man in the woods, and has recently returned from a police inquiry. The coarse, unkempt Commoner (Kichijiro Ueda) demands to hear the remainder of the Woodcutter's story, and so he recounts three "versions" of the shocking rape/murder, told from the perspective of the Bandit (Toshirô Mifune), the husband (Masayuki Mori) and the wife (Machiko Kyô), each story differing substantially from the other two. The existence of subjectivity, it seems, has permanently obscured any chances of ever knowing the absolute "truth" of the incident, with each perspective ? perhaps deliberately, perhaps subconsciously ? distorting the truth to conform to their own interests. It is revealed that even the seemingly-passive observer, Woodcutter, has his own reasons for adjusting the facts, this final revelation almost permanently denting the honest Priest's (Minoru Chiaki) belief in the goodness of Mankind.After portraying a modest, tentative rookie detective in Kurosawa's 'Stray Dog,' Toshirô Mifune is an absolute revelation as the notorious Tajômaru. Regardless of the specific version of events, Mifune unequivocally dominates the screen, his maniacal energy and frenzied cackle certain to imprint on your mind. The basis for the film was derived from two stories by Ry&#x16b;nosuke Akutagawa, with "Rashomon" providing the setting, and "In a Grove" supplying the characters and plot. The flashback components of the story unfold under the dappled light of the trees, and, on several occasion,s Miyagawa films the Sun directly through the leaves of the forest canopy, perhaps representative of the "light of truth" that is being obscured by the inherent dishonesty in Man {personified in the selfish Commoner}. Of course, Kurosawa couldn't bring himself to end the film in such a pessimistic fashion, and the Woodcutter redeems his previous deception by offering to care for an abandoned newborn baby discovered in the gatehouse. As the rainstorm ceases, and the glorious sunlight once again begins to beam down upon the lands, the Priest finally regains his faith in the goodness to be found in a man's heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps more linear than not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although there are many ways to define the non-linear narrative, I would like to argue that Rashomon is not a non-linear piece in the traditional sense, but rather contains only elements of non-linearity than as a whole. It includes, for the most part, digetic non-conventional elements in a linear type structure (one that is fluid in terms of its story) as opposed to the traditional non-conventional structure containing mostly non-digetic material. That is to say, when the characters and viewer do not have a frame of reference as to where they really are, (i.e. location, dialogue, and story) but are rather given vague suggestions, the traditional non-linear structure is more present than not. However, Rashomon does not leave the viewer confused or without a frame of reference. This is clearly illustrated around the stories main theme: In a world of deceit, can anyone be trusted? From the beginning, the viewer holds expectations that the film is going to reveal a story within a story within a story?all told from four different perspectives. As it turns out, this structure remains consistent throughout the piece. Already then, this film does not follow the true non-linear format. Following the true format would create more chaos and less order. This aspect of the film's orderliness brings up its digetic qualities. Not only do the characters in the story know that they are telling stories within stories, but the viewer also understands this aspect. Thus, time and space are not irrationally violated. It's true that the film contains non-linear elements that are demonstrated through its use of flashbacks, but the flashbacks themselves are set in a linear structure. The viewer always has a frame of reference as to where they are. The director presents this idea in the following way: Dissolves are used each time a character begins telling their story/flashback, thus allowing the viewer to enter that world without confusion. Knowing this sets up the viewer to contemplate the stories theme.The four different perspectives that are shared regarding what happened between the woman, her husband and the bandit, leave the viewer, as well as the characters in the story, unable to distinguish the truth from the lies. In one story, the woman indulges the bandit and asks him to kill her husband so she can marry him; in another, the woman is appalled by the bandit's actions and rushes to the aid of her husband but is rejected. When the priest tells his side of the story, he tells it through the perspective of the dead husband, who in turn lives vicariously through a witch doctor of some sort. This particular story stood out above the rest as the best example of non-linearity. When the witch doctor tells the police that the husband was stabbed to death, she herself acts out the stabbing sensation to heighten the effect of the actual death. This element added a type of metaphorical abstraction to the film more so than a realistic quality. Still, the viewer cannot objectively come to a solid conclusion on whose story is true and whose is false.However, the viewer is given strong incentive to assume that the man who carries the baby away at the end was the truth-teller. Why? Because the other two men have created suspicion in the viewer to think otherwise (i.e. the first man stealing the arm bracelet from the baby, the second man lying about the dagger in the story so he could sell it for money). Both implicit ideas strongly reveal the film's theme in terms of the corrupt nature of men and their tendencies to lie to gain the upper hand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd give any Kurosawa film, except maybe for his very first and very last ones, a mark of 10/10. His films should be watched over and over again, their inner depth and cinematic mastery are breathtaking. What is strange about Rashomon is that it was taken among western viewers as a film depicting the inability of memory to capture reality, somewhat like Antonioni's Blow-Up. But, watching the film, that is not what is depicted. What we get to see are three characters, each telling his or her version of a crime that was committed, each blaming himself or herself for an act of murder. The bandit says he has killed a man after raping his wife. The wife says she has killed a man, her husband, after being raped by the bandit. The dead man himself, through a possessed shaman, says he has killed himself, after watching his wife being raped. It's hard to believe they would have doubts about something like an act of murder or suicide and their complicity in it. It is obvious that at least two of them are lying (and not 'simply' remembering differently what has happened). Isn't it peculiar that the characters fake their guilt and not their innocence? I believe Kurosawa tries to tell us about the way people make up their own personal blame in order to get respect, the way they tend to crave self-sacrifice. This critique is then taken even further, once the witness tells his own version of the story, and the monk looses faith in humanity. Kurosawa has dealt with similar themes in some of his other movies. These issues, I feel, are much more complex than what is usually perceived as the film's 'existentialist' theme, and might also hint at what has alienated Kurosawa's art from Japanese audiences.Perhaps, ironically, the real 'Rashomon Effect' could only be found in western audiences' perceptions and interpretations of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rashomon is the story of a heinous crime told through the views of different characters that were involved with it.A few years ago a buddy of mine told me about a movie that I had to see. This movie that he was talking about was Seven Samurai. I usually took his word in such situations but when he gave me the DVD and I saw that it was an old black &amp; white Japanese movie I never made an effort to watch it. After watching Rashomon, by Akira Kurosawa ? same director as Seven Samurai, I must say that I'm intrigued to see his other work now.Not only is his directing and scenery like what we are use to seeing in movies today, he is the pioneer of this. His camera angles and lighting are amazing. I like the way that he shows the sun through the trees as the woodcutter is walking through the woods and also as the camera follows the bandit and Samurai. Also, I must say that I am a fan of the way he incorporated the rain as a mood throughout the movie.Another quality thing about this movie was the characters. I would say really good job on the actors' parts, although the bandit's laughing annoyed me. I really like the way the Samurai's story was told through a medium. The scene was dark and scary; an element I didn't know could be used so well in older movies such as this one.Overall, I would definitely recommend this movie. Although, just as all movies, its not one that everyone will like. I would say fans of film, movie buffs, and fans of Japanese work would love this. Hats off to Kurosawa, I pay close attention to the way that films are directed and edited because it is one of my favorite elements of a movie, and he did a fantastic job. The actors also deserve credit for this film also, because they did a wonderful job making these characters believable and interesting. I definitely plan on checking out other work by Kurosawa after seeing this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film Put In Perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rashomon was a great achievement of the time and still holds a lot of its great cinematic elements today. It is a movie that tells a story and it tells it very well. The traditional style of the movie seems a bit odd for the taste of most Western Audiences today. This has a lot to do with the long rolling scenes and very few cuts at times. This can be looked at as boring to some people and that can detract from the overall experience of the movie itself. The actors made the story very believable and worked with the scenery and natural settings very well. The whole unreliable narrator aspect to this movie made it very interesting because there are very few movies, even today, which don't give you a direct aspect of what has happened. A lot of the cinematic elements that are present in Rashomon are ones that have been taken for granted today and are sometimes hard to point out. From the set and on site locations to the actors and the story itself this film was very well made and is one of the more enjoyable foreign films around.The way the film was shot and how it progressed is not suitable for all audiences. The most appropriate audience, for enjoyment of the film, is the one that is familiar with Japanese film or Asian film in general. A lot of the scenes have too much build up for the typical American Audience. A lot of the great aspects of the film will be missed by people who do not understand the genre well. That being said this movie is very enjoyable when you are in the mindset of who the film was originally made for. It has a very interesting story and it never gives a resolution to the story only different aspects of what happened. The non-resolute ending and the lengthy performances are not what most Americans would prefer, but the ones who can put this film in perspective will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technique sends differing messages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A must see movie for film technique."Rashomon" is a movie that encompasses both, "In a Grove" and "Rashomon," two stories written in pre-war Japan, into one cohesive, post-war film. In the movie, a samurai is found dead in a forest. The movie is the accumulation of accounts from different people, each telling their story of what happened. Conflict ensues when the accounts, while similar, have vastly different conclusions.From a technical standpoint "Rashomon" is a movie that is a pioneer it its time. The use of nature, sky, and weather are truly one of a kind. For example, when people are shown as small creatures inside of a huge forest that envelops them, the insignificance of one man over all of nature shines through.While on the topic of shinning, deliberate shots of a sun-filled sky are scattered throughout the film. These spots of intense sun splashing through the tree tops is always paired with a time in the story the when viewer beings to think they are listening to an untrue portrayal of events.Knowing that in film, sunshine is typically used to show truth and purity, this indicates that while there is bad in all humans (as seen through the incessant lying) there is at least a little bit of good that lives with the bad (as is seen through the sun.) Keeping this same theme in mind, the sun points to the individual accounts as not being a total fabrication, indicating that there is a little bit of truth in all of the accounts. However, the film indicates that while there is perhaps some good in people, the bad side is what will always prevail, it is the easiest to satiate.A step further.The words of the characters tend to indicate that they are all false and all bad (this is a post-war perspective.) The environment, tells a different story, allowing for the possibility of some good (this is a pre-war perspective.) With these ideas in mind, it is fair to say that the language of the film is modern, while the ambiance sends a traditional outlook.These subtleties make the film. By bring many opposites and situations into the same screen, Akira Kurosawa (director), is allowing the viewer to draw many of their own conclusions. Each person can take a different message from the film. In fact, it would be fair to say that within each person a different meaning may come to pass with each successive viewing.Check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Human Nature and Truth or Lies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roshomon, by Kurosawa, is about a murder. The movie is based on two short stories by Akutagawa Ryunosuke called "In a Grove" and "Roshomon." There is a trial where the viewer is the judge. Four different people give their version of what happened in a murder. There is a bandit, a wood cutter, a wife and a woman medium who speaks as the dead husband. They all observed the murder, but they all have different stories. The Roshomon is a gate with different floors and levels where three men are discussing the murder and trial.This film was thought provoking because in court, there are usually at least two people who agree on what happened. In this case, each person presents different versions for different personal reasons. There are many unreliable narrators. They all lie. While some may say that dead men don't lie, I would say, well why can't they? The woodcutter doesn't tell the complete truth because he profits by selling one of the possible murder weapons. The bandit embellishes the story to make himself look tougher with sexual prowess. The wife calls on the appropriateness of the times and culture to protect herself. It would be a disgrace to show her shame in front of two men-one of them her husband. We really don't know what happened, but even the murdered husband could have lied via the medium to protect himself from embarrassment. I enjoyed this movie because it discusses motivations within the heart of man.The setting and atmosphere was wonderful. The play on light in the forest and grove was effective. The rain represented clearly the dark side of the sadness in life. Even the perspiration on the actors due to the actual temperature during filming worked in favor of the film. Two of the characters "over acted." The bandit's laughing and the wife's dramatic crying was a little too much. However, when the wife abruptly stopped crying and became dead serious, she appeared almost mad. That portion of the film was well done.This film would most appeal to film study students who are interested in the technical aspects of film making and directing. It would also appeal to students studying the culture or country of Japan. Those who are interested in looking at human nature and watching films without the pat "clear ending" will like this as well. While this film was quite drawn out in some scenes, fortunately we have the fast forward button. I loved the emotion, tense scenes and the unique look at human nature. The significance of the film in view of reality, is pondering the question, "can we ever really know what the truth is?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie Kurosawa ever directed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rashomon is based on two short tales by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, Rashomon and In a Grove, and easily surpasses its source material. This movie introduced Japanese cinema to the West back in 1950 and pretty much launched Kurosawa's international career.The main innovation Rashomon introduced in the film world is portraying the same story over and over, in four ways it was perceived by multiple characters. This was ground breaking back in the day when films usually carried a straight-forward storyline. We're never told the correct way the events unfolded and are left with our imagination on what actually happened in the grove. The characters twist the story depending on their class or honour. For example, the sword fight between the bandit and the samurai is seen as an epic, polished battle through the eyes of the bandit, but also as a life-or-death struggle between two desperate men in the eyes of the woodcutter. The characters retell their testimonies to the camera, making it appear like the audience itself is the judge.The music is great and very fitting. A lot of people are put off by the version of Bolero played during the wife's story, but I think it fits wonderfully and is the best version of Bolero I've ever heard.The cinematography also deserves a mention. Characters' motives and actions in the film aren't painted in a black and white manner and the visuals reflect this, showing them covered with the shadows of the forest, by the sun seen through the trees, which is, like the truth, partially obscured (by the way, despite the popular opinion, this wasn't the first film to point the camera at the sun, Kurosawa did it earlier in his Stray Dog). There's a heavy downpour throughout most of the film and adds to the bleak atmosphere of the scenes at the gate. In the end, when hope for humanity is found, the sun finally appears and shines through.The performances are notably over-the-top but that's what makes them memorable, be it Noriko Honma's performance as the creepy medium, Toshirô Mifune as the maniacal bandit (Kurosawa had him act like a lion for a full effect), or Machiko Kyô as the samurai's wife (who also had a great main act as lady Wakasa in Mizoguchi's Ugetsu, another film which popularized Japanese cinema outside the country itself).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Kurosawa masterwork</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon is a film that works like a Japanese Alfred Hitchcock suspense thriller, though it is a riveting suspense thriller it has a different plot that even though is suspenseful that Hitchcock never used a plot like this. It is about the aftermath of a murder and the many different points of view of what they think really happened. Kurosawa uses a cast full of unfamiliar people to us (in other words familiar to the people of Japan)which includes Toshiro Mifune in the title role as a samurai bandit accused of murder, and Takashi Shimura as a middle aged man who finds all of the evidence to the scene of the crime just a few days after the murder happened. This was a well executed film that really made me want to see Kurosawa films a lot more often because of how great this movie really was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jidaigeki Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are only a handful of films that so permeate the film culture that they are loaded with so much expectation, having influenced so much, that it's impossible to see the film for the film itself. Kurosawa has made quite a few of these films, of which "Rashômon" (1950) is, for me, the hardest to approach for the very reason that it seems to penetrate everything.The narrative is, of course, legendary not only how it is executed but how it has influenced art ever since. The untrusted narrator was hardly a new invention, even in film, since didn't noir explore its possibilities in depth? But it is never the novelty of the idea rather than its execution and application that counts in the end. And not that I think it's even remotely interesting and important who did what first here - the reason I mention noir is its vicinity to "Rashômon", which can be aptly described as jidaigeki noir. This is what Kurosawa did so well, taking a genre and then reshaping it, often revolutionizing it in the process.Perhaps there's a need to moralize towards the end that doesn't seem to come so naturally, since to some extent the drive of the disoriented narratives works toward a rather more pessimistic solution, yet on the other hand it's wise to have a counterpoint that actually gives some sense of closure. And if one yearns for pessimism, Kurosawa gives that amply in his last epic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fascinating Paradox ... A Timeless Landmark ... An Iconoclast Masterpiece ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1950, Billy Wilder unveiled the darkest sides of the Hollywood system through the stylishly iconoclast noir masterpiece "Sunset Boulevard". The same year, with a simpler and more minimalist setting, a Japanese film-maker named Akira Kurosawa made "Rashomon", an oddity whose "R" like for "Revolution" shook up all the cinematic conventions. Three different persons with different tastes provided their reviews, the youngster, the intellectual and the technician, proving once and for all that "Rashomon"'s greatness essentially relies on its fascinatingly paradoxical nature.*** Old but Timeless, Foreign but Universal *** A Review by "The Youngster" "No offense, but there's something weird with Japanese language, it was really hard for me to take it without laughing sometimes, I mean the over-the-top acting, the solemn poses, and all that theatrical stuff. But I must admit that the beginning was very intriguing, a priest and a woodcutter sitting in a temple in a downpour, apparently disturbed by what they've witnessed. Then comes a man who, just like us, is curious and wants to know what the story is about. I didn't expect the movie to surprise me, especially since it features a simple case of murder, a samurai killed, a bandit arrested and a wife dishonored, all the three protagonists have lost. According to the bandit, the wife submitted to him, and then he bravely fought the husband, the samurai. I finally got what the film was about, when the wife told her version: the bandit raped her then she fainted and woke up with her husband dead. I was bluffed, because it reminded me of all the movies I love, with a story told from different perspectives, "The Usual Suspects" or non linear narrative like "Reservoir Dogs". But the icing on the cake, what really caught me off guard was the dead husband telling his version from a medium. That was so cool. If only for the moment when we understand what the film is about, I always recommend this film to my friends. It looks old and sounds foreign but on the content, it's more universal and modern than any film made today."*** The Iconic Iconoclast*** A Review by "The Intellectual""Akira Kurosawa conquered cinema with "Rashomon", his first masterpiece that threw away all the conventions, offering a plot within a plot, even better: three subplots within the central one. Kurosawa elevated the field of storytelling to a dimension never explored before: telling a story from four different perspectives, each one distorting the truth not necessarily in favor of the teller, since each one admits to be the killer. If I might use a culinary metaphor, watching "Rashomon" is like eating artichokes: when you're finished, there's more on the plate than when you started, "Rashomon" leaves you with interrogations whose answer rely less on your personal understanding than your own approach to the truth that you'll inevitably end up questioning, the truth and how it might be undermined by a legitimate, but no less dangerous, subjectivity. Intelligence comes from the Latin verb: intellego, which means 'to understand', it's a derivation from 'inter lego', literally 'to read between', and clearly "Rashomon" is an intelligent masterpiece inviting us to read between these different stories. "Rashomon" is a pamphlet against people's vanity, with still, a light of hope at the end. Indeed, never taking the ingenious plot structure for granted, the film also features its impact on the listeners, those who don't care and act with the same egoism as the wife, the samurai and the bandit, and the woodcutter who 'read between the lines', and gives the priest his faith in humanity back." *** Neither the sun nor death can be looked at with a steady eye*** A Review by "The Technician" ""Rashomon" is the most insightful cinematic essay about humanity's natural tendency to distort the truth to satisfy an inner egoism but the talent of Kurosawa is to convey this idea less with words than action. "Rashomon" could have been indeed a silent film, its real strength come from the photography and the editing. The film doesn't consider unity of time, space and plot, and provide three settings. The court's white and neutral background allow the characters address through the judges, the audience, in a way, it represents the white screen, a sort of fourth wall Kurosawa subtly breaks allowing each one to tell one version of the truth, a formidably choreographed sword-fight, a poor heart-broken creature or the theatrical posture of a man who disown his wife. When the truth is revealed by the woodcutter, even the acting becomes more authentic, the two men look at each other not with defy, but fear, their panting increases, and their fight is a pathetic display of self-defense moves where the winner will be the luckier. The two main settings work by a simple contrast, a pouring rain making the water look like ink and a blinding sunshine. The first shot of the woodcutter walking in the forest is shown by a long traveling shot toward the sun, the camera being the only steady eye that can look at the sun. Ironically, in "Rashomon" , the sun is covered by the trees and allow the three characters to disguise their facts. And it's only fitting that the only place where their life is at stakes, is precisely the clearing where both the sun and death strike their faces" So, the youngster criticized the over-the top acting but this was Kurosawa showing the distortion of truth by pure dramatization, mocking through the pathetic sword-fight cinema's conventions like the wife mocks the two men for their cowardice, as the intellectual said, it's an iconoclast masterpiece, and although the technician praised the editing, the use of lights, he was right that the film could have been silent, but it's during silent moments that the acting was the most perfect thing in "Rashomon" transcended by the body language Toshiro Mifune as the bandit Tajumaro.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kurosawa'd not give a damn but he'd be my most favorite director if...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...he had not done this.Rashomon might be a masterpiece in what it deliberately crafted into by the grandmaster Kurosawa but it, like any other masterpieces claimed by other fellow peers or famed critics, is strictly subjected to my own ultimate judgment. And with that being stated, I cannot endorse and celebrate with the general masses on this piece of art. Because it sucks ball.The movie grants me with an ending of extreme discomfort that I have to bang my head continuously against the DVD-cover and question what was the 88-mins content I just spent starring critically on the screen is essentially about? I finally come to term with myself and realize that it's just a bunch of baloneys. What's even better is I get to watch the stupid story told 4 times differently. Very nice! The story's plot is embellished with characters that capable of bringing the art of silly overreacting to a higher realm of mastery, especially Toshiro Mifune. It also has one of the best sword-duel scene in the history of cinema that consists of the constant tripping over twigs, running around trees, dropping swords, ridiculous facial expressions and screaming. This particular scene, with an addition of a cheesy Indian song, would make a perfect blockbuster Bollywood flick.The movie has no resolution afterward. You just have to take in the 4 different versions of the account without knowing the truth in the end even though I don't see the motivation for the woodcutter to lie but you never know what's the real story. Perhaps, it's better that way because up to that point, if given that the woodcutter lies too, I'm too fed up for the real account even if they decide to reveal it.Do yourself a favor and watch Yojimbo - Kurosawa's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Influential - My Favorite Foreign Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is somewhat of a spoiler for another film right off the bat, but Rashomon is more effective in letting the viewer discern what is true and what is not than The Usual Suspects. It frightens the priest as it should frighten us what we discern about the nature of man.The beginning focuses on a priest and a woodcutter in shock after having heard three separate versions of the same event in a trial of sorts. The priest is a little repetitive about how much of a tragedy these stories are, but it is still a powerful dialogue with a close- up on the priest.The story varies from person to person, but what is in all four of the versions presented (the woodcutter tells what he saw towards the conclusion of the film) is the rape of the wife of a samurai by a bandit, and the murder of the samurai. Things get more tense and dramatic as we switch from story to story, each containing a different version of how the samurai died and a different motive each time. We are constantly asking whether one or more of the witnesses lied to protect the others, or if they are justifying their actions - either way, we get a depressing view of human nature; all three are portrayed as terrible people within the film.What is fairly necessary so that the film is not too pessimistic is the conclusion with the woodcutter making a decision to take care of an abandoned baby which restores the priest's faith in humanity. Like Birdman, I would have liked if this film ended just a few minutes earlier, but it is still powerful at the close of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In a Grove where the Rashomon lies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Earlier this evening, I had the great pleasure to watch Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece "Rashomon." A disturbing film examining the nature of truth and the human ego, "Rashomon" arrives at a conclusion that there still are good people out there, even if deception and lies are about to become the norm. (To this end, "Rashomon" might just be the most realistic character study ever made.) Based on the short stories "In a Grove" and "Rashomon" by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, Kurosawa's picture is set in the aftermath of a heinous and brutal crime: a samurai has been murdered, and his wife raped. Three people, including the alleged murderer and the dead samurai (through a medium), give varying, conflicting accounts of the crime, thus leaving it up to us, the viewers, to decipher these characters and their motives for deceiving. I am currently majoring in criminal justice in college and if I were to ever become a professor, I would certainly make "Rashomon" required viewing, and Akutagawa's book a required text. Never has conflict been so daringly portrayed on film, especially when viewed as the aftermath of a violent crime. Even after listening to the testimonies, you sort of become disillusioned that you're unsure of what really happened, and maybe that's Kurosawa and Akutagawa's point. What is certain, what is the truth, is that "Rashomon" is a classic of cinema, made by one of the greats to ever pick up a camera and shoot into a grove.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tale of Human ego</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rashomon is a tale of human ego. At least thats what a common cine-viewer would feel. Kurosawa is known to play with human emotions, and he uses this artistic skill to his advantage in this movie. The story, quite simply, revolves around a Bandit, A man and his wife. It encircles a wood-cutter, a priest and a common poor man and an exorcist. Thats all the cast is. The story is quite simple too. The Man travels with his wife through a jungle and a Bandit sees the wife and starts lusting for her. The bandit follows them and violates the Wife. The Husband is dead by the end of the event. Now, the story revolves around this death and the mystery surrounding it. Everyone has a different version for the event. The film revolves around all these four stories told by the Bandit, the Wife, The dead man (through an exorcist) and the wood-cutter. Every version, as told by each, is different. Every story is told and ends in supporting, or rather feeding the ego of the person telling the tale. Thats where the pshycology and the ego comes in. Amazing movie, highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I had a different perception about this classic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Well, men are only men. That's why they lie. They can't tell the truth, even to themselves."Rashomon was the first film from critically acclaimed Japanese director, Akira Kurosawa, that I got to see. I was expecting some great things from this film considering it ranks among the best films in history. The black and white cinematography was breathtaking and there were some great long shots, but the story fell flat and the performances here were a bit theatrical for my taste. The film is only 85 minutes long, but it seemed to drag forever. The film was made in 1950 so I can imagine there were several inventive elements incorporated here, but they really don't stand out today because we've seen those tricks so many times now. For example, it is claimed that this was the first time that a camera was pointed directly at the sun, but of course that doesn't have an effect on the viewer today. However, I've seen many other classic films which I thought still managed to seduce me and have timed really well, but it wasn't the case with Rashomon. The film focuses on different realities and perceptions about humanity, but in doing so it really never manages to find a deep meaning. It focuses on the lies we tell, our selfish desires, and our pursuit or need to believe in the goodness of humanity (reflected through the Priest in this film), but ultimately it plays down to discovering that sometimes reality is just a matter of perception and differing point of views. "Rashomon is a reflection of life, and life does not always have clear meaning," is what Kurosawa would say about this film when approached about its meaning. What I can say about Rashomon is that the cinematography is great and the lighting effects were also astonishing for its time. The film takes place during a heavy rain storm (classic trade mark from Kurosawa) as a priest (Minoru Chiaki) and a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) are taking refuge from the rain and talking about a terrible crime that has been committed. A peasant (Kichijiro Ueda) who is unfamiliar with what they are talking about joins the conversation and the two men recount the events of what they consider the most horrific crime they have experienced. The woodcutter happened to discover the body of a samurai three days ago as he walked across the woods and was summoned to testify at a trial for the samurai's murder. The priest also has to testify since he had run into the samurai (Machiko Kyo) and his wife (Masayuki Mori) as they were passing through the town before the murder took place. The woodcutter and the priest then recount what they heard from the three direct witnesses of the murder: the suspected bandit Tajomaru (Toshiro Mifune) who apparently raped the wife and killed the samurai, the wife, and the samurai himself who testifies through a medium. They all give different accounts of what took place, and each account is as unreasonable as the next. The story is told in the form of flashbacks through the perception of each witness.The main issue I had with the film is that the horrendous crime never felt like it was that terrible or memorable to begin with. It was just a common crime, a terrible one, but nothing to have an existential or philosophical debate about. Besides the main concern they had wasn't because a murder was committed but rather that everyone seemed to be lying about what happened. They couldn't find a reasonable explanation for an unreasonable act. The flashbacks were sort of interesting despite me not liking the performances, and I really liked the fighting choreography staged near the end between the bandit and the samurai. It was nothing you would expect from a Japanese samurai film. That was probably my favorite scene in this film and it had some funny moments as well. I can see the influence the director has had in modern films like Vantage Point or The Usual Suspects, but despite that I had a difficult time carrying about this movie. Well I guess I'm on the minority here, but Kurosawa would have to accept my opinion and the perception I had of this film because that is what this film is really about: differing perceptions of what we believe to be real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of Japanese cinema! A must-see!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa's classic Rashomon is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. It is often cited as the reason that the Academy Awards started a foreign film category. Incidentally, it did win an Honorary Award from the Academy for Best Foreign Film. More than a film, Rashomon is more of a meditation on this dishonest nature of man. As we listen to four different testimonies of the same heinous crime, we see that people will lie to save themselves, no matter what the circumstances. The film begins with a priest and a wood cutter speaking within a temple during a terrible rain. Their conversation is a mystery until another man arrives, and begins to ask questions about their subject matter. It is revealed that the men have just returned from court, where they gave their testimonies in a trial against a vicious bandit known as Tajomaru (Toshiro Mifune in all of his manic, savage mastery). The bandit tells his side of the story. The woman that he most-likely raped follows with her version of the truth. Then, the story takes an odd twist toward the macabre as a medium is called in to channel the spirit of the woman's murdered husband, who provides an all-together different story. Needless to say, the case is hopeless. The priest and wood cutter find themselves drowning in their own self-pity because of the horrendous state of the world. The priest lamenting that he has lost his faith in man. The other man at the temple laughs it all off, having seen too much tragedy in his lifetime to weep over the injustice which has just taken place. The film does end on a relatively upbeat tone, however. The wood cutter is given a chance to take control of life, a reminder that his life is his own, and that his decisions are still his own, even in the face of the insurmountable odds against anyone struggling to survive in his troubled times. To me, the three men at the temple are the forces of good, evil, and humanity, which is trapped in the middle. The priest is a holy man seeking virtue in a time when virtue was essentially a sign of weakness. The man who approached the wood cutter and the priest embodies the corrupted soul of man, embittered by the harsh cruelties of reality. The wood cutter, neither virtuous nor evil, is confused, and has resigned to be neutral, no matter how much it may hurt him. However, out of the midst of all of this chaos, rain, murder, rape, and perjury, hope is found, and I believe that the wood cutter takes his first step toward realizing his dream by attempting to become that which he prays for - a man of decency.This film is extraordinarily powerful. The contrast of the endless downpour at the temple and the beautiful, sun-soaked forest is magnificent, as is the cinematography on the whole. The writing and directing is wonderful, and the performances of the actors and actresses, while arguably over-the-top (note that this was the acting style being used at the time), are more powerful than anything else. Toshiro Mifune's performance was particularly striking as the remorseless bandit. Emotionally poignant performances from Machiko Kyo, Masayuki Mori, and Takashi Shimura, among others create a stirring ensemble which Kurosawa masterfully uses to weave this ancient tale (the film was based on a story called "In the Grove") into a cinematic masterpiece that brought him international recognition.I would recommend this film to anyone due to the fact that I believe it to be a work of infinite cinematic value and of great philosophical significance. This is an absolute must-see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very interesting - but a top 50 movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always divide "classic movies" in two groups. There's the TRUE classic movie, one that tells a timeless story executed flawlessly; and then we have the so-called film academy classic, usually a movie that is a landmark in cinema history for introducing a fresh technique to the filmmaker's tool set. The really old films from this second group always receive overly generous grades on IMDb because they are too obscure to be watched by anybody but film students, whose opinion is clouded by their focus on history and technique.Case in point - "Rashomon". Even though the underlying idea is indeed timeless, this Kurosawa classic is clearly in the second group. It's over-the-top acting, rudimentary dialogue, static scenery, sexist characters and tedious pacing make it feel VERY dated. However - the execution of the story is as genius as it is original, and I would recommend this movie to anybody who is interested in screen writing techniques.Compare this to "Casablanca", for example - a classic made around the same time. "Casablanca" is perfectly suited for modern viewers. "Rashomon" is not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie which is almost perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While "Seven Samurai" is usually referred to as Kurosawa's best film as it usually ranks the highest out of all of his films in "Best of" lists, "Rashomon" is often compared to it, and the 2 films can often be seen as rivals. The impact that "Rashomon" has had on cinema history makes it a pretty strong contender to top it as well.After a priest, a woodcutter, and a commoner take shelter in a former gatehouse, they discuss a murder which happened days earlier. They discuss different sides to the story that the people involved in it said when questioned by the police, all of which contradict each other.What this film is most famous for is its use of flashbacks. Flashbacks were practically non-existent for old movies back then, and most of them were straightforward. "Rashomon" stood out from them, and it was very influential when it was released. In the scenes where it shows the suspects giving their sides of the story at the courtyard, they are faced directly at the screen. The police in front of them who you'd expect to be asking questions are never shown on screen, and they never say a word. It feels like the characters are communicating with the viewer, and they're telling them so they can decide which story they believe. This is known as "Breaking the 4th Wall". It could be possible that this film influenced this film technique.Another aspect of this film which deserves recognition is its cinematography. The symbolic use of sunlight gives the movie a greater sense of ambiguity. Film critics and professors have discussed what it means in the film. Some critics have said that it's used to represent evil and sin in the film. There was one scene where the woman gave into the bandits demands after she looks up at the sunlight. You could argue that sunlight is used to represent good, while darkness is used to represent evil. Also, director Akira Kurosawa wanted to film in only natural light. However, he had trouble getting enough of it as it was too weak. To solve that problem, he used mirrors to reflect the light. Also, the water used as rain in the gatehouse had to be tinted with black ink so that the cameras would be able to capture it.The weather is a crucial aspect in this film and it also is in many other Kurosawa films. In the scenes at the gatehouse, the weather is rainy most of the time since most of the characters are in a depressed mood after what they experienced at the courtyard. The parts of the film where they discuss the murder all happen during the rainstorm. The rain symbolizes mankind's wickedness. It is present up until the ending where the priest finally restores his faith in humanity. After that, the rain immediately stops and it is replaced with sunshine.A common criticism people have with this film is that they think that its acting is over-the-top. It bugged me at first, but the more I thought about it, I began to realize that there may be a deeper reason for why the acting seemed weak at times. The several scenes of the crime aren't really happening in real life. These are all secondhand accounts of the crime told by the criminals. For all we know, the criminals could've been acting real mellow. We don't know for sure. We are relying on different viewpoints of the crime told by people who all probably have unfavorable opinions of the other people involved in the crime. Even during the scene where the bandit does an over-the-top laugh at the courtyard isn't really happening as well. Those scenes are flashbacks as well told by the 3 men at the gatehouse. This is a very creative technique that Kurosawa added in the film. From what I read, the acting is an extension to a common style of Japanese theatrical acting. However, while the acting may be over-the-top, I still liked it, because it was passionate and charismatic. Something tells me that the acting would've been more sterile if the movie had been released today.Overall, this was a really great movie. It's not my idea of a masterpiece as I felt like the priests' sudden change in opinion at the end of the film was a bit vague. However, that's the only flaw to this film in my opinion. Everything else in it is really good. The flashbacks that Kurosawa presented were really good and original for their time, the cinematography is really symbolic, the weather contributes to the film (which is only the tip of the iceberg), and the acting is actually pretty creative. Despite being over-the-top, it gets much deeper than what many filmgoers say about it. Overall, this is a really great movie, and I'm glad that I watched it. It changed cinema many years ago, and it remains just as vital today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pensive tale of seeking out elusive objectivity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rashomon" was one of Akira Kurosawa's masterpieces, as the film features an ingenious narrative structure, excellent acting and a musing exploration into the fine line that separates perception from reality. The story of a barbaric crime and its aftermath is recounted from 4 contradictory viewpoints and we are given the gruesome details of each one. "Rashomon" is a beautiful piece of art for so many reasons. In a way, it plays out almost like more of a parable than a film. When asked about "Rashomon", Kurosawa once said, "One of the technique of modern art is simplification, and that I must therefore simplify this film." The plot itself is fairly straightforward and we are not left in a major state of ambiguity by film's end. However, this is a film that, like its enigmatic characters, seeks an ulterior motive. Aside from merely providing us with guidance on how to properly conduct ourselves, it frequently uses metaphorical language which helps to elucidate the more complex ideas. "Rashomon" is didactic in its search, not discovery, of moral and spiritual answers.And that word "search" is very important to the ultimate meaning of "Rashomon". This film does not seek to provide some revelation of truth to negate the varying perceptions, but rather to delve deeper into the human psyche by calling attention to the disparity between how we as humans think and rationalize. It is near impossible to adequately praise Kurosawa for what he created with "Rashomon". The astonishing cinematography and use of "dappled" light perfectly captures the eerie, shadowy feel of the atmosphere. All of the actors (Mifune, Mori) bring a gripping realism to their characters. The dialogue is intelligent and introspective, particularly with its constant reflection of existential questions. What truly set this film apart is that, to a certain degree, every line uttered seems to reveal some level of humanity. There is no superfluous detail I can recall that needn't be said nor presented throughout.One aspect of the film I found particularly interesting is how Rashomon chose to supplant the presence of a judge (to whom each person is recounting their story to) for silence, with each individual stating, then proceeding to answer, the question supposedly being asked to them. This technique demands that we be the one to deliberate over their conflicting stories. It is up to us decide for ourselves "What do we believe?" or, for some, "What do we WANT to believe?" It seems that Kurosawa is trying to convey the idea that, in the end, there is no one right answer - truth is, in itself, a matter of subjectivity. With "Rashomon", Kurosawa offers us a powerful and masterful piece of film-making that really makes you question the human condition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific movie, but I'm not so sure the plot's as airtight as it could have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And now we have Rashomon (1950, ***1/2), widely considered one of the finest films ever made. In a nutshell, a terrible crime is committed and various people tell their wildly differing tales of the transpired events.A man dodges torrential rains to shelter under a town's gate. Two other men, one older and the other a priest, are already there. The older one keeps muttering that he "can't understand it." What can't he understand, asks the new guy. And so the older man, a woodcutter, tells his tale. He'd been out in the woods a few days prior and came across a lady's hat, a samurai's cap, pieces of cut rope?and a dead man. The woodcutter explains to his companions that he ran to find the police. The scene shifts to a minimalist outdoor courtroom, where the woodcutter testifies. The next witness is led by a rope by a man who claims to have caught him ? the prisoner is a bandit, played by the legendary Toshiro Mifune. His captor says he came upon the bandit after the latter had apparently been thrown from his horse and was slaking his thirst at a lake. After the captor tells his tale, the impulsive bandit ridicules him and gives his version, which begins with his spotting a young lady riding a horse in the forest, being led by her husband, a samurai.The bandit says that he wanted the young lady for himself, so he lured the samurai away from her and then attacked him, tying him up with rope. Then he abducted the lady and had his way with her, with the husband still tied up. The end result is that the samurai is killed.The lady follows with her story, and then we get a third version from the deceased samurai, through a medium. Each of the speakers blames someone else for the murder, and other details in their stories don't match, either.Okay, so there's plenty more that I'm intentionally leaving out so I don't spoil this 60-year-old movie for you all. Suffice to say we have multiple stories that contradict each other, a plot hook that's shown up in countless movies since then ? like Reservoir Dogs, for that matter.Rashomon is a stirring visual masterpiece, brilliantly directed and photographed. It's definitely a classic. But there is a plot point I have an issue with. We hear these stories, and it's obvious that only one can be the truth ? they contradict each other, but they do so consistently. That is, the same detail will differ from story to story. Then, near the end, we hear an additional story that negates all of the others wholesale, thus making it seem as if those earlier tales were simply filler.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Interesting Must Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know I am totally writing this review out of my memory of watching this movie. There is a certain thing about reviewing the movie when you have just finished watching. Sometimes certain scenes can come to the fore and help you better elaborate and justify the review. Sometimes, it is better to let the movie sink in and then write the review about the movie. This one falls into the second category. I was just Wow-ed by this movie. This movie exploits an interesting method of perspective narration. Stories are often perspective oriented and in this movie, one story is narrated by many people involved in the story.What the viewer as well as the person who is listening to these sets of narration has to decipher is - which one is the truth? While you start with this idea, you end up taking it to a whole new level and not knowing if there is a true perspective you would want to search for? The plausibility of some of these perspectives as well as the intertwined self interest of the narrator implies that there is this haze in everything. That is when the film leaves you hanging and you're stunned by the turn of events. Its as if someone has tempted you and left you high and dry. Thats what's the Rashomon effect.</fullReview>

This was Kurosawa's first big international hit, from then on his films would be avidly watched and (usually) feted as Art. His style was always so breathtakingly simple that you can't help but get sucked into the rainy and sunny bestial world depicted in here, with a beautiful use of the black and white nitrate film stock contrasting against a sordid storyline.</fullReview>

I could see the mean humanity of characters from what they said only convenient to themselves. This film depicts ugly part of people well. But finally, I could feel human kindness because a woodcutter decided to grow up a foundling. I found the ray of hope as a human from his behavior as same as a Buddhist priest. We may not be able to imitate easily his action.And, I laughed about a duel by Tajoumaru and Kanazawanotakehiro. Their real sword fight scene is very terrible. I have never seen such a funny fight! I think they are quite different from the image of the samurai which we have. There was no piece of gallantry. The gap between reality and Tajoumaru's testimony taught me his cunning characters.

		<shortDescription>There is no single version of the truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of "Rashomon" is one that resonates within all of us as it demonstrates effectively and clearly a fundamental aspect of human nature. You can see the so-called "Rashomon Effect" demonstrated everywhere everyday, be it classrooms, offices, homes, online chatrooms or even in the streets. Anywhere you can find a human. As a species, we are highly opinionated and our impression of events, of people, is largely influenced by what we know of them or how we see them.This is demonstrated by an incident involving a traveler, his wife, and a bandit. The bandit ambushes the traveling party, immobilises the husband, has his way with the wife. What follows after leaves the traveler dead and the bandit and wife fleeing. A woodcutter and priest, who narrate the story through flashback, tell of the three similar yet conflicting accounts of events told from the perspective of the bandit, the life and the traveler)speaking through a spiritual medium)with each claiming to be the killer. A fourth account is given by the woodcutter at the end of the narrative, as he witnessed the whole thing but even his account is unreliable as he lacks a clear vantage point and has reason to lie.This is a rather deceptively simple concept but one which spurred endless versions, imitation or derivative. But it could've all been terrible if not for the skill with which it was shot. Starting from the woodcutter's opening sentence "I don't understand" said while taking shelter from a torrential storm, it sets the atmosphere of mystery and uncertainty that fuel the narrative. The acting is well done while Kurosawa's use of lighting, deliberate slow-motion, and zooming in on the facial expressions, generates suspense that could rival Alfred Hitchcock. But one of the best aspects is the ending, which quietly but effectively summarizes the concept. The priest, knowing what the woodcutter has done, immediately assumes that he intends to steal whatever little the baby has while the truth is that the woodcutter wants to adopt the boy. This shows clearly how a person's interpretation of another's actions can effectively colour their perspective of "truth".A person who hates another sees nothing but constant affirmation and justification of his hate in each and every one of the other person's actions while a person who loves another comes up with endless excuses for their behaviour. As far as they are concerned, their impression is fact. Truth is somewhere inbetween these two extremes.You can see this everywhere. Even in something as simple as watching a movie. If people hate the director or story, they will nitpick if they have to for something that affirms their hate. If they love the story or the director, they will make endless excuses. Somewhere inbetween is truth and freedom from bias.In conclusion, Rashomon is one of those rare movies that speaks of impressive visual direction, good acting, good concept and excellent storytelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kabuke Theatre in Akira Kurosawa's niceties in Story Exposition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the late 50's, Akira Kurosawa was deemed a rather outlandish director before he became an auteur and a real innovator. This was essentially because his range included a large repertoire of Western Conventions with the crossover of Japan's Conventions that he executed so differently, yet so powerfully. A contingent of japan would deprecate him, not because of the quality of his work, but rather the aberrance of his movies. But when his movies really spanned across the world that unconventional streak Akira had with his movies in Japan slowly piqued American audiences eyes at the genre crossover (the influential luminary he would become in the 20th century would be tenable by directors such as George Lucas, who had the concept of the lowest character Point of View for "Star Wars" from "Hidden Fortress", Sergio Leone's inspiration from "Yojimbo" to create the leading character for his Dollar Trilogy, Steven Spielberg honouring him at his Life Time Achievement Award and lauding his work and Darren Aronofsky, who has said that one of the scenes in "Requiem for a Dream" became inspired and heavily dictated by Kurosawa's unique usage of camera angles that was so overbearing for him to imitate, testifying that Kurosawa was really beyond time) and by explicating it more into the 21st century, you will notice this in many movies with his use of music (leitmotivs), his use of segues, his skill with rain in dramatic scene, his mise-en-scenes. The only thing from "Rashomon" that has never seemed to catch on is the One Dimensional Character coming centre stage as we go through the environment of "Rashomon - or more accurately, the uncertainty of "Rashomon". So this wasn't Kurosawa's debut film (in fact, he actually directed 11 movies before this and a couple of scenes in Uma), but it was his first lofty film and Kurosawa's first shot at becoming fully fledged master of cinema. Rashomon - everybody should really know what the movies story is - but if you don't, it's about 3 Narrative POVs that include a couple of wood cutters, Toshiro Mifune (portraying Tajomaru implicated in a crime case - if you look at the character development of his illicit character, it's so disparate now to see him in protagonist roles, where he would become the symbol of morality, anti-hero or fallen warrior. In this movie he is clear-cut evil) and a wife of the man who got killed by Tajomaru (apparently). With the one dimensional character that comes to the Rashomon under a shelter from the rain, we see that he will spark contention and bring an audience's confusion through his subordinate POV to the whole story about these other events whether fabricated flawlessly or feigned unconvincingly. The movies premise: lies; the movies focal point is more about fearing the truth, as the heinous crime that the plot centres around brings our characters to boiling point - and how Akira Kurosawa directs the flashback scenes to show how implausible some of the stories really can be. Times, places, points and evidence - This is where the movie really shines is how it revolutionised the Narrative Structure that Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction" would adopt. Some of my favourite things about this movie to me is the the real human condition that gets analysed and the foundation of the world that Kurosawa composes. It has amazing Black and White, making the images and iconography eidetic. It really shows how eclectic the art of Japanese Cinema can really be (I have always misunderstood Japanese cinema until I found Kurosawa and When you listen to the wife's story this subtext element becomes cognitive to the audience that... something is going wrong and something flagitious is changing the ideas aforementioned. I think it's one of these movies that can be set aside after watching it, but you feel the veritable impact it has. I gave this movie an 8, as while I still love the movies arresting plot devices and low brow characters, I still feel subsequent from watching it, you will feel like you're missing something (a very indifferent ending), the sun, however, makes this unclear and kind of leaves this in the dark. However my score is really because I feel it is very much variegated in our understanding of what the movie is - will there be retribution? Will there be salvation ultimately climaxing the events that merry the films Aesop/point? Was that guy who exited the frame, deciphering the story, know who they were? The movie is quite ambiguous, while it still tries to make you embrace the facts already exposed, although this is notional. The movies set up may just be a suspenseful artifice to make you feel a certain visceral impact to whether or not something was omitted or something was substituted due to being too multi-dimensional or faceted. Either way the narrative with what it has backing it, tells it with substantive eloquence. I moreover feel Stanley Kubrick (my favourite director) actually takes inspiration from this movie, in terms of its assiduous study of the human condition and his style backing this notion.Anyway, I feel the longevity of Rashomon shows that it is not as antediluvian as its age suggests. It's an adroit study of deception being a crime heinous enough to equate to the crime being studied bringing us back to the epigram "What you don't know can't hurt you" and then slanting the meaning in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An influential masterwork that is timelessly challenging, incredibly philosophical, and ultimately, highly rewarding.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Rashomon was released in the early 1950s, the production studio involved complained that it was one of the worst films ever made, and threatened not to release it. A year later, it won the Oscar for the best foreign film category. In fact, Rashomon is often credited as the reason that the Academy created the category. It was also the film that catapulted master film-maker Akira Kurosawa to stardom. Such was the fate of Rashomon that it still bewilders many. But like fine wine, it gets better with age. Looking back, it dawned on many critics that this was an exemplary film, a masterpiece in its own right, and unequaled to this day.It runs at a modest 88 minutes, but it packs a lot in that time. Exploring themes such as Man's greed, selfishness, and lust, and the inability of Man to articulate the truth, and how obscure truth really is, Rashomon's story is so simply constructed, it becomes profoundly complex in nature. The film revolves around four key eyewitnesses to a heinous crime, all giving entirely different accounts of the event. Who is telling the truth? No one knows, not even Kurosawa himself. There's no clear solution at the end, but that's not what Rashomon is driving at. The film seeks viewers to understand the nature of Man's actions, and how sometimes the faith of Man himself is in doubt.The artistic direction by Kurosawa is flawless, using rain, sunlight, shades to evoke unique settings, differentiating past from present. The cast gives mesmerizing displays, vicious yet sympathetic at times, especially Toshiro Mifune, and Machiko Kyo, whom are the star performers here. The use of clever flashbacks by Kurosawa, and the courthouse sequences in which we 'do not hear the judge speak' are pioneering film techniques. This experimental narrative by Kurosawa is the epitome of Japanese cinema, the embodiment of film art itself. An influential masterwork that is timelessly challenging, incredibly philosophical, and ultimately, highly rewarding.GRADE: A+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A groundbreaking film worth repeated viewing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rashomon is a groundbreaking film on many, many levels. Directed by Akira Kurosawa in 1950, it stars Toshiro Mifune, Takashi Shimura, Machiko Ky&#x14d;, Masayuki Mori and Minoru Chiaki. The gist of the plot is that a man was murdered and his wife raped. Or maybe not. It depends on who's telling the story. The movie's title has become a word in itself meaning a situation in which events and motives are indeterminable, where truth and fact are subjective and uncertain.The film bears repeated watching; first, for the story, then for the potential meanings. For some reason, I'm reminded of "The Canterbury Tales," which is a series of unconnected stories told by pilgrims on their way to visit a shrine. In Rashomon, the stories are about the same event although there are few connections between the versions told. We watch as conflicting tales about the same event unfold, leaving us unanswered questions instead of final resolution. It's possible to see the film as a discourse on the nature of truth, of reality even.Then there's the issue of good and evil: is it black and white or is there gray? Is the nature of humanity to have both good and evil in our beings? Throughout the movie, there is a conflict of how to judge our fellow humans. Each person tells the tale to suit his or her own ends; how can we trust any of them?I thought the camera was a character in the movie, perhaps because of the issue of objectivity. In the opening scenes, we are shown a woodcutter walking deep into a forest. The camera walks with him sometimes, showing him, but sometimes we see from the point of view of the camera, moving through the forest looking at the trees and skies. Somehow I felt I wasn't seeing the forest through the eyes of the woodcutter; I felt I was supposed to be there, looking for myself. So another potential is that there is no camera -- there is me watching the various scenes. This situation is repeated in the trial where the witnesses looked back at me answering questions as if I had put them to the characters. I was made a part of the problem of finding out what happened, since I elicited conflicting testimony and never resolved it. Among the quandaries of the movie is whether I can ever know the truth. It's much more personal than whether the characters ever know the truth -- It's whether _I_ ever know, can ever know.Another issue that Roman Polanski brings to the fore in "Le Locataire" ("The Tenant") is whether the camera lies. Our experience in movies is that when the camera is used by the director as the objective presenter of scenes, the camera does not lie. Conversely, when we're seeing events subjectively through the eyes of a character, we accept that the events we see may be distorted, even false. Kurosawa gives us no clue whether our objective view is objective at all. All the views seem to be true and mutually exclusive at the same time. We've watched movies all our lives, and we've come to accept the world within the four corners of the screen as 'true' for the purposes of the movie, but Kurosawa rips that convention to shreds and scatters it among the leaves of the forest. Kurosawa's camera has no claims to truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is in the top ten for many directors out there for a reason.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon first sight of the poster, I thought this would be some sort of strange East meets West action film (I'm obviously aware of the Kill Bill and Ninja Warrior films). I was quite surprised, however. It started with a few guys waiting a rain out and telling what appeared to be a ghost story. It was certainly not that... well it was in one part, but I'll leave that out. Anyway, what I was amazed about was that as each character told their part of the horrible crime of humanity that took place, I completely forgot that it was an old movie and was focused on who did what. This movie is in the top ten for many directors out there for a reason. Despite it being considered an antique by most young people out there, the message and story have withstood the test of time- it's a work of art that brings up that question of human nature and how we even bother living with all the bad things going on in the world. Thanks to pretty much every aspect being open to different interpretations, the story is unique to each and every viewer. Whatever they've experienced in life, they probably can relate to the story.The choreography and cinematography was a great combination that is sure to keep even the modern viewer at the edge of their seat (particularly the frantic fight scene). The more modern remake, though well shot and my favorite tone of velvety dark noir film, didn't manage to outdo its original master. Although, the remake is still something worth looking at.There ain't no school like the old school.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dragon's Gate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Finding shelter in a driving rainstorm at the deserted Dragon's Gate, Rashomon, monastery three strangers a woodcutter priest and peasant find out that they each were involved in a trail that left them in a state of disbelief. The trial was that of the notorious Japanese bandit Tajomaru who was tried in the murder of local nobleman Takehiro and the rape of his wife Masago. As each one of the three strangers recount the story it seems that they contradict themselves in them being totally at odds with what each other says about it. Tajomaru was nothing but a low down rat who after seeing the gorgeous Masago riding on a horse through the forest decided to make her his woman but he had to get past her Samurai husband Takehiro to do it. This lead Tajomaru to ambush the pair and tie the husband as he raped his pretty wife Masago. That was Tajomaru description of what happened, which didn't help him at his trial, but the other witnesses to the crime including the dead Takehiro,through a Medium, had far different visions of it!In fact it's the rape victim herself Mrs. Masago who seemed to be far more guilty then Tajomaru in what happened to both her and her husband Takehiro! It seems like the true version of the event is told by the eye witness woodcutter who kept his mouth shut during the trial because he didn't want to get involved. The woodcutter brings out out in this fascinating conversation that in fact it was Masago who wanted to leave her tied up husband and take off with the man who raped her Tajomaru! That's because in her mind Tajomaru was the better, in bed?, of the two! With Takehiro now feeling less then a man in not openly preventing his wife from being raped but being reject by her as her husband and lover the only thing left for him was to do himself in with his wife's dagger that he bought her as a wedding present! This the woodcutter's version is more or less a lot like what the dead husband recounted through a medium about what really happened! Or really did it!The audience is skillfully left confused in what exactly happened between the three Tajomaru Takehiro &amp; Masago in that they seem to be hiding something in order not to implicate themselves, if a murder did in fact occur, in what really happened. It was a pleasure for the rain to finally let up so the three, the woodcutter priest &amp; peasant, can go their own way and do their best to forget what they just went through as well as talked about. Classic Japanses movie about not trusting anyone in what they heard or saw even if your the one who heard or saw it! P.S Even though it's nowhere as well known or critically acclaimed as "Rashomon" the British film "Five Angles to Murder" or it's other title "The Lady in Question" that was released almost at the same time as "Rashomon" has the same plot but is far more entertaining as well as less confusing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't age that well as time goes by, but still proves to be solid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been long anticipating to watch this legendary movie of Akira Kurosawa due to the widespread praise I've heard of, major amount of which of course focuses on its exploration of human nature. And consequently, surprises come with some little disappointments (that generally don't hurt this classic though).One of the early scenes which tells the farmer's encounter with a situation shows Kurosawa's use of lighting. I found it very fascinating, because lighting really plays a big role in this film. In later scenes, some deliberate dynamic lighting effects can be noticed as well, which build up the climax, especially the inner thoughts of characters and certain upcoming twists.Many of those who still haven't watched it might know that the film's talking about honesty and the human nature related to it. It certainly deals with something like self-deception too in this case if you ask me, while I found certain points a bit too exaggerated by today's standard. For instance,the bandit's motivation for admit the kill is quite vague (if everything he tells is true). Even if he just wants to show his bravery and fighting skill, you can't say that one doesn't care about his life most. Average guys would do anything to avoid a death sentence for example. That doesn't quite follow the purpose of lying in this movie: to benefit ourselves that is to say. Another thing is the monk, who stands for a symbol of fairness and righteousness, seemingly cannot tolerate anything that's not righteous, even not much as "doing evil". The "striking" case can kinda be viewed as something that frequently happens in today's view.But as a movie that was made in 1950, nothing much can be expected perhaps. The ambition it has is really ambitious. The case itself still feels like it can be expanded to deeper depth IMO, but the ending the film is a solid put and leaves the audience huge suspense, depending on how you treat a man that has lied. I'd say due to the era during which this classic was born, some acting seems sort of unnatural. And it over- criticizes dishonesty and selfishness, taking them as considerable dark sides in human nature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost Glory and the Subjectivity of Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rashomon, directed by Akira Kurosawa, was his international breakthrough in 1950. The leading roles of it were played by Toshirô Mifune and Takashi Shimura, both of whom worked with Kurosawa in his subsequent films. Rashomon is a great example of Japanese modernism which started in the 50's -- ten years later compared to the United States. Rashomon was made just before Japanese films arrived to Europe, and therefore is one of the most remembered Japanese classics. Kurosawa represented a complete different kind of Japanese cinema that Europeans had so admired -- Mizoguchi's lyricism. It is a matter of opinion who is better, but now days Kurosawa is much more well known -- which of course doesn't necessarily mean better. Rashomon is an extremely intriguing film about glory and the loss of it.Three men go to a temple to avoid the rain. They start to discuss about a recent murder trial; a bandit raped a woman in front of her husband and then killed him. Each of them have their own visions of what happened in the trial and in the forest where the murder happened. In Rashomon we see the event from four different perspectives and each time with a different solution. There's even a perspective of the victim, who got killed, because Kurosawa had the brilliant idea to show his view on the murder, through an oracle. But there is no reason to assume that his view on the case would be any more truthful than the others'. Rashomon is a philosophical survey of people and the human nature. How everyone told the story differently, trying to make themselves look better. So who can you trust? Basically it's about truth and the subjectivity of it. As well known, Kurosawa often dealt with strong taboos of Japanese culture. The whole film happens around three men who discuss, quite emotionally, which is unusual for Japanese men -- and not just Japanese, it's an universal taboo. Another important theme of Rashomon is the glory of man. Is life worth living once you've lost your glory? Kurosawa shows the madness of this question brilliantly as the man looks his wife getting raped, insensitively and without compassion. Criticism for the contempt of women can also be seen in the film, as it can in the films made during the 1950's by Kenji Mizoguchi. The wife of the man, who got murdered, was only an object to the bandit as she was to her husband. After the woman betrayed her husband she was worthless. The man had lost his honor and nothing mattered to him anymore. The scene where the woman was protecting her husband from the bandit was extremely powerful. As you see the husband, tied up in the background, you can sense the apathy in his eyes. Once glory is lost there is no reason to live for him.The last scene of Rashomon is something I will never forget. When the men hear a baby crying. One walks away and the other offers to take care of it. Then we see him walking away with the baby which is both, a strong cultural taboo but also a sentimental culmination of Kurosawa's depiction of humanism and the human nature. In the end one can also sense some criticism for capitalism, individualism and the modern world. In the temple one of the men claim that in this world one can't trust anyone and survival is impossible without being selfish. But then the other man proves him wrong as he takes the baby, unselfishly, out of solidarity and compassion. Akira Kurosawa was openly a socialist but, to my mind, his films show that humanism was the greatest ideal of all for him. His films go far beyond political, historical and cultural limitations.Among the great themes of Rashomon, it is visually spellbinding. The poetic, silent-film-like, narrative is amazingly beautiful. The black-and-white cinematography gives a great expressionistic touch to the characters and the visual world; its tight grip of nature and fascination for the subjective truths of individuals. For its cinematography and narrative Rashomon is modernism, which can be seen in its way of showing humane emotions. The camera takes close-ups of tears and drops of sweat; showing us what the characters are feeling below the surface. Many have criticized the work of the actors as exaggeration and over-simplification, but in my opinion it's just perfect. It truly reminds one of theater and silent films, but it doesn't have the same exaggerating elements many silent films did; make-up and expressionistic gestures. I think Kurosawa had thought about the acting carefully, and directed his actors precisely, through which he achieved realism. Not the conventional realism of the outward appearance of reality, but of those things that contribute to this reality which one feels under the surface.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intriguing mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having first seen this film 60 years ago in a 16mm print, I had the opportunity to see a restored 35mm print. The significance of this event is that I have mentioned more than once in reviews the influence of Rashomon's narrative technique, most recently in 'Avatar'. This new print shows the detailed close-ups, but it shows also the lighting flaws. Hanging reflectors in the trees to reflect sun into the shadows might have saved a few yen, but the movement of the light spots was sometimes disturbing. Artificial, to say the least. The sound in this well-equipped cinema emphasised just how unbalanced it was, both thematically and acoustically. Nevertheless, Rashomon has earned its place in the pantheon of iconic motion pictures. The complexity of the story remains a model for film-makers. Perhaps the acting is wooden; we expect more than lengthy shots of blank expressions. Only Eisenstein seems to have mastered that trick. The rain was well done, in contrast to,say, 'Singin' in the Rain'. The Japanese used dark colouring in the "rainwater"; Hollywood used milk!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kurosawa unleashes rain in this movie to drown us in pure awe!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rashomon is a 1950 period movie that talks about human ingenuity. The movie encompasses the philosophy of honor, lust, greed, piousness, bravery etc.. The movie beautifully shows the characters changing their stance for what they have been judged too. The movie is as relevant today as it was 6 decades ago. Kurosawa is know to use weather a part of his films and in this movie he uses rain. The rain makes a virtual blanket to the three men discussing the trial. The woods is a perfect setting for a bandit, a samurai and his wife to confront each other. It gives the film the mystery and also brings out the true emotions out from the characters.The trial scene with the testimony is a creative way to talk to the audience. With the interrogator out of the picture we see the characters talking to the camera and answering questions. The final scene where the man who finds the murdered body confronts the guy who listens to him is where we find out the human nature to lie, steal and survive.The movie was definitely a breath of fresh air to me. I would be soon watching his other classics like Ran, Seven Samurai, Throne of blood etc.. Kurosawa is one of the greatest directors and a gift to the world of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The truth shall prevail. Or not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Opening Japanese cinema to the world (particularly to the West) upon its release, Rashomon's enduring qualities is most evident in, along its title having been introduced into the English language (as in the Rashomon effect), its theme's strong resonance even after almost 60 years it was released. Narratively simple yet paradoxically complicated, Akira Kurosawa's widely hailed classic deftly examines the unknowable virtue of truth that even the oft-recited mantra "To see is to believe" loses its meaning when thwarted by mankind's ultimate predication to subjectivity and -- perhaps -- psychological egoism. Adapted from two Ryunosuke Akutagawa short stories, Kurosawa's saga concerns itself with an event that transpired in the woods as recounted in wildly differing perspectives three days later at a court trial by the three participants and one supposedly impartial witness as shown in revolutionary flashback sequences. The differing yet equally plausible testimonies are nonetheless bound by one unequivocal truth: a samurai (Masayuki Mori) died in the woods during an encounter with a bandit (Toshiro Mifune) who may or may not have raped the former's wife (Machiko Kyô) and who may or may not have killed the samurai in the process. The bandit claims the samurai's wife yielded willingly to his sexual advances and he killed the samurai in an ensuing duel; the wife swears she was raped and that his husband committed suicide using her dagger; while the samurai's ghost (speaking through a medium) recounts how his wife wanted to go with the bandit and have his husband killed. Compounding the issue is a woodcutter's testimony that radically differs in details from the previous three accounts that to piece together the details from each perspective into one coherent story is an exercise in futility. No matter, since Kurosawa's concern is less in presenting an objective account of what truly transpired than demonstrating the uncertainty of truth, a theme he and cinematographer Kazuo Myagawa often engage in here -- a murky perspective of the world signified by the torrential rain in the opening sequence, the avant-garde direct shot of the sun partially obscured by leaves, the dense forest where the main action takes place, and one character's continuous monologue that he "does not understand". Masterfully buried in ambiguity and anchored by strong performances, Rashomon isn't much about providing a solution as it is a proposal to come up with one's own conclusion based on one's partiality, a masterful artistic depiction of how truth can be flawed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's human nature to lie. Most of the time we can't even be honest with ourselves."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The nature of truth and its' relativity are the subjects focused on in Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon. The story revolves around a man found murdered in the woods, the events leading up to it are told from multiple points of view with each of the people telling their version of the story with different reasons to lie, or perhaps even believe they are telling the truth.Much has been made of the narrative devices employed by Kurosawa. Rashomon is told mostly in flashbacks, with the same event being repeated over and over again as everybody has their say on what went down and it's not hard to see how it influenced future film makers such as Quentin Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs) and Stanley Kubrick (The Killing). It is easy to imagine how cutting edge this technique would have been in 1950 and I take nothing away from Kurosawa but let's not forget Orson Welles had done similar things with Citizen Kane nine years previously, though in that case it was used to show how people can have differing opinions of a man, instead of an event as in Rashomon.Kurosawa felt that since the invention of the 'talkies' in the 30's, cinema had somewhat lost it's visual storytelling capabilities and relied too much on dialogue. He strove to make Rashomon be an unconventional experience, with many scenes lasting minutes without conversation, merely letting the setting, music and tone carry the narrative. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. As enthralled as I was throughout most of the film's second and third acts (the first is all talky set up and as a result rather dull) there were times when I found myself wishing that it would get a bloody move on.There are a couple of fight scenes in the film and I feel I must mention them due to how different they are from what we would normally see from films featuring Samuri. They are not so much fights as scraps, with characters rolling around on the floor, desperately grabbing for a sword just out of reach. Expertly choreographed and executed, they are wonderful to watch and genuinely entertaining.The performances are good across the board. There's a bit of overacting here and there but for the most part the cast carry themselves well. The standout, however, is Toshirô Mifune as the bandit accused of murder. He is a cackling maniac and wonderfully flicks between utter lunacy and childlike desperation.Although the main focus of most people, including Kurosawa himself, is on how Rashomon is about the nature of truth, I also feel the film puts a great weight on the nature of faith, specifically man's faith in himself and the rest of mankind. It is hard to talk about this without spoiling the film but please, watch it with this in mind and see what you think. I watched Rashomon within a couple of days of viewing Ran and these themes were certainly prevalent in that film also, though Rashomon ends with a slightly more positive outlook.Though not a perfect film, Rashomon is certainly a very worthwhile experience and a must for anybody interested in the development of storytelling techniques in cinema history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The philosophy of Kurosawa.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa, arguably the greatest Japanese director of all time, introduced himself to Western audiences in a big way with this brilliant, yet tantalizing story about a horrible murder that occurred in the woods and accounted by a woodcutter, a bandit, a woman, and a dead samurai. Unfortunately, there is no real way to know what really happened since all the stories are different and impossible to piece together. Therein, lies the meaning of Kurosawa's philosophy of this film. In life, there are many instances when to know the real, rock-solid truth is simply impossible.In this story, as Kurosawa reveals in the multiple flashbacks of each character's depiction of the event, we are led to believe that they are telling the truth since we can obviously see what is happening. However, Kurosawa is challenging the concept of seeing an event occur that makes it true. In the society we live in, seeing is believing. Kurosawa attempts to destroy that idea and paints a dismal picture of people doing bad things for all the wrong reasons, namely their own personal gain. For all these characters, to lie was to get ahead in some way or another. Thus, it is hard to believe anyone and their version of it. As the priest does, we feel a great amount of animosity towards humans since it seems all they are in for is to survive on their own and not care about anyone else. As we try to unveil this mystery and discover the truth, Kurosawa keeps our interest with some very nifty camera work that is world-famous today (camera pointing at sun, long shots in forest, etc.) If you have heard of anything about Kurosawa, this is a great place to start studying him and his style. He is undoubtedly one of the finest directors of all time and the mind-bending Rashomon is one of the best examples of film-making in the last century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bandit, the Traveller and his Wife</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rashoman" begins grey on grey with rain coming down in buckets. Three men are sitting the storm out under cover of the ruins of a temple. One is a priest, one is a thieving marauder and the other is an ordinary working bloke, a peasant/woodsman. One of the men, the woodsman is quite distraught. He complains mysteriously about how "it" can't be true. The others ask him what "it" is. And so the story begins.A murder trial has occurred. An infamous bandit has been caught and charged with the murder of a traveller and the rape of the traveller's wife. The bandit is being interrogated by the authorities. One can never see these authorities; only the person giving testimony faces the camera, thus, giving the audience the authority of a jury. What transpires at this trial are a series of testimonies about what happened at the scene of the crime, each from a different perspective, each with a differing take, nuance and emphases on the matter of the murder and rape. The bandit has his turn and then comes the wife and finally, using the wife as a medium, the ghost of the husband has his say. But, there's more. There was a witness there that fateful day, an observer who was in the very same forest, an ordinary man who will tell his version of events only to those gathered beneath the ruins at Rashoman."Rashoman" is a study in perspective and a reflection on meaning. By the time the film has run half its length, the audience has been told many truths about what happened on the fateful day when the husband met his untimely demise, not the least of which answers the question of who was responsible for a murder. As a part of the audience, you become a member of the jury.Who are you to believe: the bandit, the wife, the husband's ghost or the woods man, who has not testified at the trial? Further, what if none of them can be believed, which parts of their conflicting stories are true and which false? Do people really compulsively embellish the truth about themselves and their motives? Can the truth be known? A baby cries in the ruins. Someone must take responsibility for life. Will it be the priest, the marauder or the woodsman? The Sun has come out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The darker side of a great director!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rashomon (1950) has all of the charm and atmosphere of an Akira Kurosawa production. However the subject he explores and the tale he tells to us viewers this time round is much more unsettling and much less lighthearted than many of his mainstream movies.I first bought Rashomon on DVD a few years ago as I had just recently became a big Kurosawa fan after having watched several of his most influential works including Ikiru (1952), The Hidden Fortress (1958) and not to mention Seven Samurai (1954). All of which had ranked well among my favourite films of all time. So I thus had to check out more. And this was recommend to me and being a fan of Murder Mysteries the plot's summary excited me.Set in 17th century Japan, Rashomon tells the dark tale of a vicious confrontation between a ruthless bandit (Kurosawa regular Toshiro Mifune), a wealthy samurai (Masayuki Mori) and his beautiful wife (Machiko Kyo) during which the husband is killed and his body discovered by a local woodcutter (Another regular Takashi Shimura).However upon going to trial all four testifier's, including the bandit, the wife, the dead man (speaks through a local medium) and the woodcutter each give four completely different accounts of what actually happened that fateful day and which make no connection whatsoever with the last.Who is telling the truth? Is only one of them being honest? Are they all lying in order to present themselves in a good light? Or are they all lying to deliberately cover something up? Are they merely giving their own accounts of what happened through there own eyes and from there own points of view? Could Woodcutter's account as the only commoner and passer by on the scene truly be the genuine Revelation of what happened that afternoon? Or is he too holding back on something in order to keep the REAL TRUTH from the audience? All the joys of a "who done it" only much more thought provoking and far more deep in the long term sense. Though a black and white film that does not prevent the camera from creating many colourful and mystifying shots aided by the use of light. The Japanese landscapes are again beautiful and the music haunting thus delivering a peaceful setting to this overall tragic tale and making this an unforgettable movie experience.The nearest the 20th century got to Shakespere. Rashomon is without doubt ranked among my twenty movies list and is definitely in my opinion one of the top ten movies of all time in terms of being well made.A must see classic. 9/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm serious. On the one hand we have the double-flashback, multi-perspective, what-is-reality musings which actually get you somewhere for a change; on the other you have a small parcel of gender-integrated a-holes beating the sh*t out of each other out in the wilderness for practically the entire running time of the movie. While I'm told the framing device was padding to bring it up to 90 minutes, I found the ending perfect anyway - I still think version # 4, with its takedown of chivalry-and-honor romanticism, is Kurosawa's own reading (correct me if I'm wrong), but the ending serves as an announcement that even he can't be trusted, and that this message shouldn't be mistaken for nihilism. What an economical production, and yet there's just enough judicious application of style - I especially like the 'you-be-the-judge' framing in the trial scenes and the dazzling camera movement as the key witness walks through the woods in the opening scenes. Like Russ Meyer, Kurosawa sure knows how to stage a fight scene. And like Orson Welles, his games have guts and feeling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rashomon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is called as one of the best movies of Akira Kurosawa and also of the world. I was too eager to see it. So when I got the opportunity I grabbed it.The story is based on a small 20 pages novel by Akutagawa. The movie shows four different versions of the same gruesome event of raping of a woman and afterwards killing of her husband. The versions are told first by the dacoit, then the woman who is raped, then by the spirit of dead husband and finally by a wood-cutter who is the sole witness. All stories are different, and whose story is true remains a question. The movie raises moral and ethical questions about human behavior and nature. The end of the movie does not show which story is the one that really happened.Apart from such an interesting story, it is the treatment given by Akira that is magnificent. The picturesque shots of the forests are mind blowing; I will mention a few ?the beginning shot of the wood-cutter walking through the forest, the other shot of the sun rays coming down in the forest with the horse standing and the woman sitting besides, and the rain shot of the temple ruins where the priests and commoner discuss the event is classic in scale. The characterization is perfect ? the nuances of different characters, the changing emotions and opening of layers of their thoughts with each story are brilliant.There are in total just eight characters in the movie. All the characters have acted well. But Tajomaru's character as wild dacoit is raw and Toshiro Mifune has really brought that mean and gruesome character to life ? as all time greats to remember in world cinema.Akira shows that with a simple story, with only a few characters, one can make a gripping story if one knows the medium and the presentation. The scripting is excellent and the audiences are left in eager curiosity of what would happen with each passing moment.Last point about the music score ? it is outstandingly tuned with the proceeding. Akira knows what background score to put ? where and when.Great show, hats off to Akira ? still after 57 years Akira holds the cinema magic with the viewing.(Stars 8 out of 10) 8</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One simple story - a husband murdered, his wife raped by a bandit. But this movie isn't simple - Kurosawa was years ahead of his time in playing with our perceptions, our expectations of what a story should be, or what reality should be. And best of all, he doesn't patronize us by giving us 'the truth'. Each version of the story is believable, but none are compatible.To add to all this - predictably the technical qualities of the movie are superb. Every shot is magnificent. No wonder film makers (as opposed to film critics) adore Kurosawa. He uses every trick in the book (and some he invented himself) to tell a story, without ever showing off his command of the language of cinema. Simply amazing.I'll set out some caveats - the movie is somewhat dated (inevitable, given that its influenced so many subsequent movies). A movie from this period isn't to everyones taste. The ending is just a little too contrived and falsely optimistic. It doesn't have quite the dynamism and raw power of Seven Samurai. But I would still strongly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Light at the End of the Tunnel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So as an American audience you might tend to think "so, who did it?" which means we're missing the entire point of the story. It isn't about whom really did it; it's about the fact that you may never know. But what's more important than you never knowing is that a person can fix his or herself which is what you see at the end; a sort of light at the end of the tunnel effect.Kurosawa is an excellent director. He was the first to point out the deception of human beings, through camera angles and verbal cues. I thought the actors were amazing. I thought he sort of showed that anyone, even those of court, may be deceptive, but he did so in a very respectful way. He had the poor man flicking off bugs and laughing like a crazy man, which I thought was hilarious because he was so unbelievably psychotic. He then showed us the very well put-together wife and samurai. Kurosawa then smacked everyone in the face by showing us even those of court can be deceptive, which is hard to take.However at the end when he showed the woodcutter showing that he really wanted to change his ways and not be evil, Kurosawa gives us a taste of hope. The most interesting thing in the whole movie, though, is when we see the woodcutter walking away from his own ignorance, and the rain stops, but the monk is still stuck in the ignorance. I thought that was such a good way of showing that even if you're religious you may still have to find your own way. The monk didn't show him the way, the woodcutter found it on his own.Despite so many genius ways of portraying an idea, there are still some things that may drive an American audience crazy, such as the very long camera shots that follow the characters, but to get the point of the movie you'll just have to get over it. To find out what Kurosawa is really saying you have to look at it through a non-American perspective. You have to get over the long camera shots following the people, the screaming baby the monk can't hold it the right way, the very weird eyebrows on the women, and the fact that you want to know who committed the crime. So the only people I would not recommend this to those who cannot get past this, but if you can it's worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lying to Oneself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rashoman is a great foreign film that follows four different views from four different people that experienced the same episode. The episode was the story of a husband and wife, and a bandit that gets in the way of the couple's travels. This movie does not have a satisfying ending where it is revealed what really happened. All of these differing views do not give the ending any help either because none of them seem to overlap one another or have many ideas that are the same throughout them. This relates to the credibility of the people as well seeing that none of them seem to know what the truth is and it is about lying to oneself.This movie definitely did not have a big budget as there were only about three major scenes that were seen over and over again. This film did not seem to be based on the landscape or the many different places but more on the characters and what they had to say. The one scene that stood out the most was the one that dealt with the whole story which was in the woods. There was a lot of focus on the emotions of all the characters and the animation they used when telling there side of the story. The plot was very simple considering the whole idea was to see the lie that everyone was telling themselves in order to seem more honorable or a good person. Conflict is undeniably apparent in this film because of the inconsistency of the stories and what takes place in the woods.This film has one of those endings that leave you thinking about what really happened. This story is not scary to keep people from taking a walk in the woods but rather to show how people tell stories and make them out to look good. I would definitely suggest this to people that enjoy foreign films and would like to experience something different from American films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rashomon's Lie's and Moral Decay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rashomon the movie, which was released in the 1950's, has many traditional and modern Japanese themes integrated into it. Everything in the movie represents some sort of traditional or modern period aspect of moral decay. Akutagawa is credited with writing Rashomon in 1915, and Kurosawa produced the movie in the 1950, but there views are very different. Akutagawa's depiction of Rashomon shows how there was no hope for survival, but Kurosawa shows how there could be hope for mankind through symbols like the sunlight at the end of the movie. Everything in the movie has symbolism; the gate that was falling down can be looked at as the moral decay in humans, and evil taking over. Kurosawa filmed the movie from traditional time periods, and reinterpreted it as modern problems. Kurosawa represents moral frailty in the movie through the wood cutter. The wood cutter sees moral decay, death and killing all around him, and he finally gives into evil also. But what Kurosawa represents is light at the end of the tunnel, or hope for man kind through the wood cutter. Even though the wood cutter gave into evil, his willingness to accept a starving child into his famished household shows how he forgot about his attachments and thought of helping someone else. This Buddhist idea does not show up in the Akutagawa story. Rather, Akutagawa only showed how there was no hope for mankind. In the movie each person told the story that made them look the most noble and respectable, this made the narrator very unreliable, and made the story unconcluded as a whole. Even today, in the western culture there are very few movies that have narrators that are unreliable, and the movies that do always conclude with the facts. Rashomon as a whole was a very well filmed movie with non-traditional ways of capturing the audience, between its odd views of the landscape and the obscure camera angles, this movie paved the way for creative directing and movie producing. Rashomon was a well written well filmed movie about 11th century Japan reinterpreted as modern problems of moral decay, that is thought of as one of the best foreign films around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truth and Lies of Murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kurosawa's film, Roshomon is the story of a murder, told from four different points of view. A samurai husband was murdered, he, his wife, and bandit, all claim that they are the murder. A woodcutter also claims to know who was responsible for the crime. The film is made up of all of their testimonies, given to a court, which is actually, the film's viewers.This film was very thought provoking, because it showed how all people like to see, and even retell situations, in a fashion that makes themselves look good, or moral. The atmosphere of the film was eleventh-century Japan, and from what I have read about that point in history, the film was a good representation of what the Japanese environment was at that time. The dress and dialect of the characters seemed realistic, to what I imagine eleventh century was like. The way that the court room was made up of people just sitting on the ground, outside, gave reflection to the destructed atmosphere of Japan during that time. The plot did follow all the way through the film. From beginning to end, a viewer will continue to focus on who really committed the murder and the morality issues of all of the characters. Although, I viewed the film through subtitles, I didn't concentrate on reading the words, because the setting, and camera work was so realistic that I could tell what was happening, just by watching.The characters were extra dramatic, but because of that, they were convincing in their stories. The wife's constant tears, the bandit's annoying, menacing laugh, and the confused gaze of the woodcutter, all added to the films effect. A viewer would know the imposed personalities of all of the characters from the small personal traits that Kurosawa assigned to them. The camera work did add to the drama of the film. When the married couple was traveling through the forest, the camera caught them in the same way a person who was sitting under a tree might see them. The shots that focused directly up at the sky made me think of a journey, or traveling. I think that is the affect that Kurosawa wanted to receive from those shots. The music in the film is the characteristic that drew emotion from viewers. When the medium was giving testimony, her story could have been told directly from the music, because it was a perfect reflection of the pain and terror that she was describing. Because I was born almost thirty years after this film was recorded, I don't feel it was an editing masterpiece, but compared to other films that were recorded in the 1950s, Roshomon was distinctively creative. The long emotion shots of the faces, and the scary voice of the medium, were both creative and new ways of expressing drama.Overall, I enjoyed the film, and could understand the main message. Kurosawa was using this piece of art to explain the moral standings of eleventh-century Japanese figures. In the film's conclusion, the viewer is left feeling that although everyone has some bad inside, they also have good, so there is hope for the future. For anyone interested in morality issues, eleventh-century Japan, or film making, this film is a winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rashomon - Japanese Crime Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rashomon is a combination of Akutagawa's stories, Rashomon and In The Groove. I was weary about the combination, but Kurosawa pulled it off with beauty and smooth transitions from one scene to the next. The scenery, which was all shot outdoors, was imposing but beautiful, consuming you in nature.Deception is the prevalent theme throughout the movie. During the interrogation, all of the characters retell their stories to make them seem noble and good to the audience so we sympathize with them instead of judging and persecuting them for their actions. Everything that comes out of their mouths is full of lies and deception. They only care about themselves. This is a testament to human nature. Since we were kids, we have lied to keep from being punished by our parents or teachers, even if we were the ones involved in a deceitful act.The movie is overall long and drawn out, with lots of extended nature walks. This is its only drawback. Make it through that, and you are entertained by the ridiculousness of the character's stories and their actions.This is a good movie for someone who wishes to see how the modern movie began and to see human nature as it truly is, or if you like funny crime dramas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Optimistic Outlook</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is Akutagwa's adaptation of two of Kurosawa's most famous stories, "Roshomon" and "In a Grove." The film sticks with the basic themes of the short stories yet it offers a bit of versatility because Akutagwa shares his optimism with the audience. As we see in both, the short stories as well as the film, the characters possess many flaws. When looking at the film we see what was the pioneering depiction of the unreliable character, an art form which has been duplicated everywhere from television cartoons to movies such as "The Usual Suspects." The metaphors presented in the film such as weather, nature and even the stories being told by each accountant unleash multiple dimensions that not only show unreliability, but also add different venues of possibility. The type of venues one would find reading a poem. So, in a matter of speaking, this film could be described as a form of visual poetry, furthermore, given the optimistic approach of the ending, Akutagwa provides the audience with an artistic outlook on humanity. There is a recurring theme of putting people's actions, thoughts, and beliefs on trial, as if in a way to measure their purity of heart. Obviously, Kurosawa believed that people were incapable of good, but Akutagwa shows us that even in a world where there is constant evil there is still room for good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roshomon: The First CSI?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a fan of CSI or courtroom dramas, the style of this film may seem familiar. Director Kurasawa Akira broke a lot of ground with this film from the cinematography to the storytelling. He adapted two short stories by Akutagawa Ryunosuke called "Roshomon" and "In a Grove". The film is told in a series of flashbacks by four witnesses to a rape and murder, including the murder victim (a samurai) through a medium. To make it somewhat more complicated, these flashbacks are told through flashbacks of a witness at the trial. As with those shows of today, such as CSI and courtroom dramas, each person has a completely different story and it is left up to you to be the judge.The film visits the idea of truth. Who is telling the truth? Can anyone ever really know the truth? What is truth? The film also visits the state of man at the time, filmed a few short years after WWII in 1950, Kurasawa seems to be asking a question about the selfishness and self-centeredness of man. Does man need to be selfish to survive? You will have to judge for yourself if you agree with how he answers these questions by the end of the film.I enjoyed this film. Reading the short stories the story is based on helped my understanding of the film, not to mention some background information on the director. The setting was very appropriate for the story. I liked the flashbacks from the different characters' points of view. The camera work, from a film history perspective, was very well done and I enjoyed the music which added to the overall effect.If you don't like foreign films or story lines with flashbacks, stay away. Also if you are expecting great sword play or fighting scenes, I will warn you now?it's not what you'd expect</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rashoman in focus and dead on.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rashoman in FocusBased on the writings of Akutagawa Ryunosuke, the movie version of Rashoman tells the story of the death of a samurai warrior as told by various witnesses (and possible perpetrators), including the warrior himself, by way of a medium.To appreciate this movie requires some background into its making. Filmed in war-ravaged Japan just five years after World War II, a time when national optimism was elusive, director Kurasawa Akira projects a ray of hope, literally and figuratively, into the minds of his viewer. He uses a Toaist perspective by filming entirely in an outdoor setting and by showing the insignificance of man in the vast world. His depiction of the characters as small in relationship to nature and the use of excessive rain, gloomy locations and the macabre music of Ravel's "Bolero" convey an ominous aura from the onset. The tangled woods add to the confusion and obscurity he presents, lending itself to the mystery of this production. A film history buff may also appreciate Kurasawa's innovative genius -- he was the first filmmaker to shoot directly into the sun. Another innovation he employs is the use of an interviewing process through which each of the eyewitnesses tells their unique version of the events. This leaves the interpretation of the evidence to the viewer and creates a thought-provoking "whodunit" aspect to the story. Incorporating an additional witness not depicted in the original stories allows the director to take the artistic liberty he feels is necessary to modify the otherwise pessimistic viewpoint of the misanthropic author.The trend of movie makers during this era was one of "feel good" art in an effort to escape the miserable reality that befell most of the public up until the end of the Second World War. Kurasawa clearly strives to instill some hope in his viewers, too. Rashoman, from a cinematic point of view, does all the right things, especially in the final scene in which the viewer is moved from pessimism to optimism via the redefined woodcutter character who first represented the evil that tempts all mankind. As a result of the woodcutter's transformation, Rashoman restores faith in the heart of the viewer, leading him both symbolically and literally out of darkness and into the light.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie develops its power best, if you don't try to look out for the "real" and "true" events behind the four versions of the narration. I like that it doesn't moralize, it just states that things are only, what they seem to us. And here this shown in a very intelligent and artistic way, no silly plot-twists, no explanation in the end - it is open to your fantasy what happened, and perhaps that is more interesting than any explanation..."Rashomon" is a important piece of cinematic storytelling and a really interesting way to reflect on the origin of tales and narrations.The style of the movie and the acting may seem kind of strange today, as well as the pace and the editing. But especially this makes you not to think in clichés. Some scenes even remind me of Andrej Tarkovskijs intensive style - the rain, the ruin, the different levels of the story...The movie has to tell a truth about the cinema in general, and this truth is not very happy, I think - but beautiful.</fullReview>

If you enjoyed it and appreciate cinema, I recommend highly these films by Kurosawa, too (I've seen all of his films except 3): High and Low, Red Beard, Ikiru, The Bad Sleep Well, as particularly great, though even his lesser films are worth viewing for nuggets of brilliance. Kurosawa, like Hitch, combines sophisticated themes and understanding of human nature with the highest command and inventiveness of the craft of movie making. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genre unto itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The vast majority of films can be easily assigned a genre. Rare is the film that becomes a genre unto itself. "Rashomon" is one such film. Part murder mystery, part mystical meditation on the nature of perception and reality, "Rashomon" is a classic in every sense of the word. Having seen it at least two dozen times, I can honestly say that I've caught something new every time.Kurosawa made many films over his long career, including classics like "Throne of Blood" and "Ran" which are based on Shakespeare. "Rashomon" is absolutely original in vision as well as execution. Toshiro Mifune, with whom Kurosawa made some of his best pictures (e.g. "Yojimbo," "Seven Samurai"), gives one of the most unforgettable performances in the history of cinema. Mashiko Kyo, as the enigmatic widow, is terrific as well.You may not want or need to watch "Rashomon" as many times as I have, but I dare anyone to see it just once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My fourth Kurosawa, and definitely my favourite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rashomon. The movie that earned Kurosawa a name in the film-making world and the first of a long line of classics afterwards. This movie is probably the first to show different stories on a particular event. So aside from it being the first to do something is it worth a look? In my eyes it certainly is.The plot? in 15th Century Japan 2 men, a woodsman and a preacher tell another man about how the woodsman found a murdered man and the three stories told in court (the bandit that killed the man, the dead man's wife and a medium contacting the dead man himself) all show different sides to the story. After that finally happens the woodsman reveals himself as a witness to the other 2 men and reluctantly shares his view on the story.I have only seen four Kurosawa films so far. Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Sanjuro and this. I think this makes his best because of the tone it has, especially towards the end. This movie isn't just four stories to show different interpretations on what happened and people working it out for themselves, this is about the honesty of humanity and what they can lie about to make themselves look better (or more innocent). It is definitely worth a look if you are a fan of movies like Stalker and The Seventh Seal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An essential Kurosawa Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa is not just regarded as one of the best directors Japan has ever produced, he is widely seen as one of the best ever to live, making films like Seven Samurai, Yojimbo and Throne of Blood. One of his most highly regarded is Rashomon, an ambitious film with its storytelling and narrative methods and a highly influential film, even to this day.In Feudal Japan a Woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) tells the story of a trial of bandit, Tajomaru (Toshiro Mifune) is accused of murdering a samurai (Masayuki Mori) and each story about the same events contradicts the previous witness.Rashomon is a case of Chinese Whisper as a story keeps evolving and changing as a new layer of the story is revealed to the audience. Each narrator is unreliable as they tell a story in their own self-interest and one of the big themes is that humanity is selfish. Rashomon was a film released in 1950 where Japan was still recovering from World War II, seen the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and a new war was brewing in the Korean Peninsula. It can be argued that some humans are selfish, from small things to the bigger political and international picture. I don't agree with this viewpoint because I have a more optimistic view, but I can still make the case that nation states are selfish.Another theme is the search for the truth. Scientist Karl Popper believed that a hypothesis needs to constantly needs to be tested to be proved true and philosopher John Stuart Mill believed that they was no point suppressing the truth because it will come out eventually. This could be implied to Rashomon as each story tests the information of the provided by previous witness. As an audience we are like the people in the cave in Plato's The Republic: where we only see a limited prospection because we have only need have a limited view of the world which we see as the truth until we get to see the wider world.The final theme is a look at sexual politics and sexism, as the samurai is willing to disown his wife after she is raped and the bandit stating that women are weak, after he raped her. But as the story unfolds all three characters are relieved to be not very pleasant and vile to some degree.At 88 minutes Kurosawa delivered a tout, thoughtful film filmed that is ambitious and wonderfully made. It expresses all it wanted to in this short space of time and is very subversive in its approach to deconstructing of traditional narrative storytelling. It is clear why Rashomon is so influential, with different viewpoints of an event being used by Tarantino, Stanley Kubrick's The Killing, the sci-fi film Source Code, Vantage Point and Hoodwinked.One bit of criticism I do have towards the film is towards Mifune's performance which weak considering the source material and my God did he have an annoying laugh.Rashomon is a seminal film, a film should watch at least once. Rashomon is well crafted and important because of its place in film history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have heard of the movie Rashomon for many years, but only now got around to seeing it. I expected some Samurai war movie, so I had previously avoided it. It might be described as a fairy tale. It is told in a slow paced, repetitive way.If found myself wanting the long shots to end, not because they were boring, but because they built to uncomfortable intensity.I was was not prepared for the Toshira Mifune character. I had seen him previously, but only much older. He was indescribably sexy, with an athletic lithe body, and sculpted face, and oddly innocent. An astrologer would peg him as an archetypical Aries. Yet at the same time he was repulsive, completely selfish, a rapist, with a hideous laugh, and a habit of jumping at people, like he were trying to get some mice in a tank to flinch. He really plays with you -- push pull.The scene that stabbed me most was when the wife told her husband she had never loved him, that she had just pretended to, and she had hoped for someone like the bandit to rescue her whom she planned to run off with. She would not mind at all if the bandit killed her husband. This echoed a melodramatic scene from my own life that knocked me for a loop for decades, so it really punched.You hear the story via the bandit, the wife, the husband's ghost and the woodcutter. Just what happened becomes quite a blur. I knew certain elements of the story couldn't be true, but I could not piece together a definitive version. It is also quite hard to figure out the motive for the various lies. This movie will keep people puzzling for decades to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kurosowa's Landmark Film Is A Brilliant Exploration Of Truth &amp; Human Weakness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rashomon is a Japanese drama film directed by Akira Kurosawa, working in close collaboration with cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa. It stars Toshir&#x14d; Mifune, Masayuki Mori, Machiko Ky&#x14d; and Takashi Shimura. The film is based on two stories by Ry&#x16b;nosuke Akutagawa ? "Rashomon" provides the setting, while "In a Grove" provides the characters and plot.Rashomon introduced Kurosawa and the cinema of Japan to Western audiences, albeit to a small number of theaters, and is considered one of his masterpieces.This landmark film is a brilliant exploration of truth and human weakness. It opens with a priest, a woodcutter, and a peasant taking refuge from a downpour beneath a ruined gate in 12th-century Japan. The priest and the woodcutter, each looking stricken, discuss the trial of a notorious bandit for rape and murder. As the retelling of the trial unfolds, the participants in the crime -- the bandit, the rape victim (Machiko Kyo), and the murdered man -- tell their plausible though completely incompatible versions of the story. In the bandit's version, he and the man wage a spirited duel after the rape, resulting in the man's death. In the woman's testimony, she is spurned by her husband after being raped. Hysterical with grief, she kills him. In the man's version, speaking through the lips of a medium, the bandit beseeches the woman after the rape to go away with him. She insists that the bandit kill her husband first, which angers the bandit. He spurns her and leaves. The man kills himself. Seized with guilt, the woodcutter admits to the shocked priest and the commoner that he too witnessed the crime. His version is equally feasible, although his veracity is questioned when it is revealed that he stole a dagger from the crime scene. Just as all seems bleak and hopeless, a baby appears behind the gate. The commoner seizes the moment and steals the child's clothes, while the woodcutter redeems himself and humanity in the eyes of the troubled priest, by adopting the infant.Film buffs should love it.With fast tracking shots, black-and-white chiaroscuro camera-work and a pessimistic intimation that what exactly was done is not essential, the result hit the bull's-eye with foreign filmgoers and critics.Rashomon is a novel, stimulating movie-going experience, and a sure sign that U.S. film importers will be looking hard at Japanese pictures from now on.Finally,it is one of legendary director Akira Kurosawa's most acclaimed films as Rashomon features an innovative narrative structure, brilliant acting, and a thoughtful exploration of reality versus perception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple yet brilliant story with the execution of a master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four different accounts of the same story. Who to believe? No one? Everyone? The audience becomes the interrogator in Akira Kurosawa's "Rashomon," a film that explores the true nature of man through his subjectivity. So simple is this concept, yet few could match Kurosawa's delivery and craft it into a masterwork like he's done.In the pouring rain, a priest and woodcutter use the remainder of a damaged gatehouse to take shelter as they reflect on a rape and murder they had just testified regarding that happened merely three days before. Another man finds their shelter and asks to hear the story so long as the rain affords them the time. The priest had seen the murdered Samurai and his wife at one point and the woodcutter found the body. At the interrogation, they heard three testimonies from those involved: a bandit named Tajomaru (Toshiro Mifune) who confesses to the rape and killing, the rape victim (Machiko Kyo) and the murder victim (Masayuki Mori) as heard through a medium. Although all agree that the Samurai was bound as his wife was raped and that he indeed was killed, all three of their stories differ as to how it all happened.As each testimony builds on the next, we adjust what we feel is the truth accordingly, which ultimately leaves us with a story in which truth cannot be deciphered from lies. It becomes apparently rather quickly that the meat of the story lies elsewhere and that no right answer solves the riddle.What Kurosawa does with the story, other than put the audience in the seat of having to sort out the "facts," comes out in the tone. Although the events themselves have a black-and- white nature, he thickens their haziness with an almost fairy tale-like tone. The performances of the actors, namely Mifune and Kyo, echo more traditional Japanese theatre storytelling with exaggerations and heavy (and sometimes irritating) emotions. Mifune's cackling and Kyo's wailing have a profound impact on our perception of the events despite the fact that every character's story lacks in veracity.The key to the whole thing comes later from the woodcutter, who reveals he too has a testimony he was afraid to share. Suddenly he provides a clarity (although not necessarily a truth) to the events and Eastern themes such as the protecting of one's honor seem to factor prominently in what seems likely to be made up or closer to the truth.As the priest and woodcutter wrestle with their faith in mankind in rather blunt terms, so do we attempt to insert our own views on human nature. What sets "Rashomon" apart in this eternal dialogue of man's inherent goor or evil is the component of selfishness and looking out for one's interests. It would be unfair to say that the difference in each testimony was caused by calculated lies on behalf of the person giving it. Instead, self-interest can subconsciously warp our perspective and the way we interpret what we see and experience.Kurosawa infuses this tale with an intensity few could match, striking visuals that make you feel as if you're not seeing the same story three different times with slight variations, but three completely different takes.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A heinous crime and its aftermath are recalled from various points of view...During shooting, the cast approached Kurosawa en masse with the script and asked him, "What does it mean?" The answer Kurosawa gave at that time and also in his biography is that "Rashomon" is a reflection of life, and life does not always have clear meanings. I think that is beautiful, and makes this film one of the first -- if not the very first -- existential films.I love the killer, with his physical madness, kicking and shouting. And his animal movements, always less than human in some way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa has an enormous popularity among cinema goers and a reputation as the best of the foreign filmmakers, and thus, one of the most influential and brilliant directors of all time. Many of his movies, including this one, are considered some of the greatest films of all time. For me, this is my very first Akira Kurosawa film. I have yet to see "Seven Samurai", or "Ran", or "Yojimbo". But when I sat down to watch "Roshomon", I knew right from the starting credits that Kurosawa was going to live up to his reputation. And the film got more powerful, unique, and creative as the running time went on."Roshomon" is, like many other foreign film masterpieces, left intact in its original language. All of the cast members speak their native Japanese language and we are only able to interpret their dialogue through the subtitles. But this is the way it should be. Foreign films should be preserved like this, otherwise, they can become unintentionally comical with bad dubbing and bad lip synchronization. Even though most of us can't understand Japanese, it suits the film better and makes it more serious and authentistic.The cast of "Roshomon" is full of very talented and famous Japanese actors. There is the legendary Toshiro Mifune, who apparently did numerous films with Akira Kurosawa. He was very realistic and chilling as the leading character, a bandit and a womanizer. We also have Takashi Shimura, remembered from "Seven Samurai" and the popular Japanese monster film "Gojira". One of Kurosawa's neat tricks with the screenplay was to limit the number of characters whose names were revealed in the story. Many of them are credited simply by their apparent occupation. Examples are The Priest and The Woodcutter. It reminds me very much of the classic American film "12 Angry Men", in which many principal characters never had a name revealed. Yet, let me remind everybody that "Roshomon" was seven years before "12 Angry Men". I don't know if Kurosawa inspired this trait for the film or the play upon which it was based, but whatever the case, it was a brilliant idea.Kurosawa had a natural talent for creating innovating and suspenseful sequences and when needed, exploding with high-tension action and then having long moments of symbolism and silence in between. That's how I would describe the basic flow, you could say, of this film. Suspense, action, and then the aftereffects which often result in long moments of silence and consequences that try the morals of our characters. In this film, one does not just sin in any kind of way and then just go off and deal with their affairs without thinking about what they have done and whether it could have been avoided or done a different way. And I appreciate films that utilize this trait of creating an allegorical message for a frailty that human beings tend to have."Roshomon" is one of the greatest masterpieces of cinema history. Even know, almost sixty years since it was created, it still holds out as a powerful and popular film. It has already got me, as a cinema goer, instantly interested in seeing more Akira Kurosawa movies, for this example of his brilliant work has already proved to me at least that his talents were even better than his reputation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somewhat curiously, Japanese critics were not enthusiastic about RASHOMON when it was released in 1950 Japan. Today, however, RASHOMON is generally considered to be the film that introduced both master director Akira Kurosawa and Japanese cinema to the west; it is also often cited as the film that prompted The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to create an award for Best Foreign Language film. It is widely regarded as a masterwork of world cinema.Set in 12th Century Japan, the film's premise is at once both very simple and very complex. A man is found dead in a forest, and several people are brought forward to give testimony in the matter. In some respects their accounts agree--but in numerous others, some obvious and some very subtle, their stories differ. As each character gives his or her version of events, the various differences pile higher and higher, leaving the viewer to wonder at the motivations involved.Has each person simply interpreted the same facts in different ways? Do they deliberately lie in order to protect themselves? Are the differences in their stories deliberate or subconscious? The film offers no easy answers. Some have criticized the film for seeming to state that there is no such thing as ultimate truth, but RASHOMON is more complex than this: it is essentially a meditation on our inability, be it deliberate or unintentional, to reach more than an approximation of ultimate truth due to the very nature of humanity itself.Much has been written about the look of the film, which is indeed memorable. Filmed by Kazuo Miyagawa, it presents the forest as a living, breathing entity; the images are powerful, the editing remarkable. No less so are the performances, which require the various actors to shift in behavior as each person involved gives their own account of the event; this is particularly true of Toshiro Mifune, a frequent performer in Kurosawa films, and actress Machiko Ky. But whether lead or supporting player, all performances are equally astonishing.The film has been extremely, extremely influential over the years, and as such it no longer has quite the same "shock of the new" that it had for audiences of the 1950s; nonetheless, this is director Kurosawa working very close to the height of his power, and while he would create other films that equaled and bested RASHOMON, it remains among his masterworks. The Criterion edition is quite fine, offering a near-pristine print with your choice of subtitles or dubbing (the former is recommended) and several memorable extras. Strongly recommended for fans of world cinema.GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man's Word: Can It Really Be Trusted?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon envelops two well-known stories written by Ryunosuke Akutagawa. These stories reveal the political, social, and economical reconstruction evolving in Japan during the 1950s. The cinematic elements portray the dilapidation of Rashomon not only in the set but also by the actor's clothing, for example the rags worn by the bandit and Tajomaru. The idea that humans are evil and corrupt beings and the world we live in might as well be hell provides the central theme of the movie. The individual tales told within the structure of the larger story of the day, waiting for the rain to subside inside the gates of Rashomon. The conflict between an individual and their own conscious, perceive the nature of human beings to be weak and corrupt, this realization takes heed through the recounts of each character. Verification to the priest that the world we live in is a state of decay. Furthermore, it is ironic that the bandits reveal most of the moral lessons and insights on human behavior in the movie. For instance when Tajomaru recalls that if not for the wind, he would not have killed Takehiro that day, maybe it was because he only caught a glimpse of her that he felt the urge to follow them. Another illustration of irony, in the movie, occurs when Tajomaru takes Masako to her husband. Tajomaru almost looks ashamed. In addition, it is ironic that Tajomaru would even worry about killing someone honorably. Yet, this reveals the mentality of Japanese society in the 1950s. Moreover, the conversation between the Bandit and the Priest reveals the tendency for dishonest people to generate significance of a message to obtain what they want. Although, in the same instance the bandit tells the priest he does not want to hear his sermons. The bandit informs them that it is human to lie, that half the time we are not honest with ourselves, let alone others. Whereas, the priest tries to unveil that men are weak and this is their reason for lying. The bandit also points out, that maybe even the thought of good things is a farce and man wants to forget the bad stuff and believe in the make-believe good stuff. Beyond, the medium tells Takehiro's side of the story, revealing the mentality and nature of Japan in the 1950s. Considering the fact that a medium's testimony is valid in their political hearings at the courthouse, demonstrates the Japanese beliefs in the supernatural or ancestral realm. The medium also reveals the nature of forgiveness, how Tajomaru asking him what to do with his wife, makes Takehiro want to pardon him for his crime. Additionally, the woodcutter's account of the situation relates the nature of the Japanese to change their opinion of someone close to them. This occurs when Masako wants Tajomaru to kill her husband due to shame and describes her opposition to living her mundane life. Rashomon is definitely worth watching, and helps portray the outlook the Japanese have on the world and what they consider important. For the westerners that watch this movie remember it is not always the words that can tell a story, and at times one might wish the movie would move quicker, but just a thought, take that time to inquire about what has happened thus far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not the first time the notion of unreliable testimony has gotten good screen treatment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certainly Kurosawa, and the source author, have produced a meaningful story, with plenty of application in today's courts and news media. But, believe it or not, Hollywood preceded him by 21 years! In 1929 Fox released a courtroom drama that is startlingly similar in theme to RASHOMON. Three witnesses tell different stories of a rape and murder in court. The last one is accepted as the truth. Don't believe me? Check out THRU DIFFERENT EYES (yes, that's the right spelling) on IMDb. At the age of 9, I saw this film when in general release, and was much impressed, although truth to tell after three quarters of a century, I don't remember actual details. It had an impressive cast, too: Warner Baxter and Sylvia Sydney, among others of note. The credited authors of this story were Milton Gropper and Edna Sherry. Was there a connection, possibly unconscious, to this story in Akutagawa's "In the Grove"? Maybe, maybe not, but strange things happen in literature, stage and cinema.In RASHOMON, all four versions by witnesses are tainted, including the woodcutter's. His seems most plausible, but then he lied about what he saw to begin with. In the end, we do not know what is Truth, no more than Pontius Pilate did. But the apparent non-sequitur of the abandoned child and the rescue by the priest and woodcutter seems to indicate that there is some good in mankind, even if it does lie.Puzzling and gripping as the action and mystery is, it's not satisfying in any usual sense. It's doubtful that Kurosawa meant it to be. A great group of actors in the forest grove, and the incessant rain at the ruined temple, keep us enthralled as the stories unfold. It stands as a masterpiece of cinema, even if a little flawed and maybe not as original as often thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truth hurts...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been born in Japan while my father was in the service, I've always had an interest in all things Japanese. It took me a while to find Akira Kurosawa (I discovered him just a short time before his death, in fact), but find him I did. As the Western World was introduced to him via this 1950 masterwork, it is appropriate that this would be the first film of his that I've ever seen.As I watched "Rashomon" (so named for the place where the tale is told), it struck me that I had seen inferior variations of this story before over the years, some good, most of them dogs, but nothing even coming close to this grand vision of mankind's ability to shut out the truth if it's to his advantage. First we hear the basic undisputable facts. Then we get three wildly disparate accounts from the participants (the thief, the wife, even the dead samauri through a spirit medium) about what happened afterwards. Then we get the "solution" account that tells the answers. If there is any one phrase that could sum up all these various tellings of the same tale (and I include the "solution" in this batch for reasons the film can explain better than I), it would be this: "It's not my fault things turned out this way." Yet it is clear by film's end that EVERYONE contributed to the tragedy. No one comes off as innocent or sympathetic as a result. Maybe that's what they mean by "Truth hurts". Man's ability to delude himself is nothing short of disgusting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rashomon = literally "The City Gate" or "The Gate to the Ciy."Roger Ebert's review is very informative: http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/...205260301/1023This movie tells the story of a journey in medieval times by a Japanese samurai nobleman and his wife through a forest. They are attacked by a bandit and in the fight the nobleman is killed. There is a trial at which we hear the bandit's version and then the wife's. A Bhuddist medium summons the soul of the dead man and gives his version. Many events coincide (a fight, a death) but the meanings and implications in each version differ a great deal. Three men discuss the events and significance of the differences while they take shelter from a pouring rain under the gate to the city. One of these is a woodcutter; he not only observed the trial and tells his companions what was said but he, hidden in the woods, also actually saw the events and he tells his friends his version. Again we find the coinciding events but the differing meanings and implications. He'd not told anyone else what he'd seen or testified because he didn't want to get involved. He's very puzzled and disturbed as to why each version differs, what do these differences say about the nature of people?This is a powerful, beautiful movie which altered the linear style of movie narratives that had existed until then and opened new vistas, e.g., "Crash," "Hero" and Eastwood's two "Iwo Jimas"s. When I first saw this movie 40 years ago, its slight misogynist flavor (women are manipulative) didn't register on me and probably didn't on most others in the 1950s-60s; our culture has probably shifted a great deal since then.But "Rashomon" has significance far beyond its contribution to movie making. I'll point to its influence on Family Therapy; an analogous effect is true for history or ANY field in which there can be points of view that differ with human motivations and alliances (say world history from the point of view of victors or vanquished, or various anthropologists accounts of living with particular tribes, etc.)"The Rashomon Effect" (a term used in family systems) refers to the quite different perceptions that even closely related individuals can have of the same event or person. E.g., in any family, say one with several children, no family member has quite the same view of any other family member. In a real sense, none of the children have quite the same mother or father and therefore must view them and each other differently. The first born child entered the family when its parents had a certain financial level and experiences. The second child enters when the parents have been changed by time and the experience of having a first child so they are not quite the same parents. If the parents invested in the first child particular aspirations or hopes, favoritism or disfavor, that must strongly color that child's view of them and any younger siblings, as well as a second child's view of each parent, the older sib, etc. These various views can differ greatly among all members of that family system. "The Rashomon Effect" identifies and emphasizes the existence of these differences.</fullReview>

The theme of human deception to the point of self-deception is brilliant. Truth is so hard to ascertain because human pride is always in the way, embellishing and lying for selfish ends. Kurosawa knew a little about direction too. The nature scenes are very inspired by transposing them with samurai's thoughts. Interesting story: When AK was making this (he had yet to hit the big-time) his producer (i think it was producer) was completely against him and since he couldn't understand the film, thought it was crap. At a 30th anniversary, this same producer talked about how influential he had been in the making of the movie, how it was the first film to have direct shots at the sun, etc. He totally missed the irony!! AK, in the movie, was relating how human pride leads us to lie and obfuscate the truth from ourselves and others and here the producer of the film was doing exactly that...what a beautiful tragedy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rashomon: The Trickster Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like Asian movies, Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon is a definite must-see because it is not only an overall great film but also the first Japanese film that became an international success, a classic that started it all. Plus, Rashomon is now in the public domain, so you can watch it for free legally on the Internet. Which you should. I watched it for the first time when I was very young, but it wasn't until later years that I could fully appreciate it. It's a movie for adults in the best sense of the word.Strangely, while Rashomon was celebrated by international critics, Japanese critics didn't like it and suggested that it appealed to Westeners only because it was exotic, as Kurosawa bitterly noticed. Well, a prophet has no honor in his own country. Although it cannot be denied that the exoticism of Rashomon adds to its appeal, that alone cannot explain the out-of-nowhere international success of this movie. There has to be something about Rashomon that strikes a chord in viewers independent of their cultural background. I think it has something to do with the fact that - intentionally or not - Rashomon plays with an archetypal constellation, a pattern more or less subconsciously known, and thus understood, in all cultures (and often expressed by mythological figures): The Trickster. A trickster constellation is a pattern where several or all of the following occur simultaneously: deception, disruption, reduced sexual inhibition, blurring of boundaries, and magical practices. Rashomon is about all of that. The tragedy begins with an act of deception by the bandit Tajomaru, and the deception doesn't end there. The events are disruptive - especially, of course, to the murdered Samurai and his wife. Obviously, uncontrolled sexuality plays a role as well, as does the blurring of boundaries. Ultimatily, Rashomon blurs the boundaries between truth and fiction. Even the supernatural aspect is there: A dead man speaking from his grave through a medium, once again blurring a boundary, namely that between the living and the dead. The feelings of dread expressed by the monk near the end are also in line with trickster phenomena. At least that's what Jungian psychology says. Looking at the creation of Rashomon and at its international reception, I have come to believe that there's more to archetypal psychology than I once thought.Now, I think there is a reason why foreign critics liked the movie better than Japanese critics. It is simple but paradoxical: It is easier for foreigners to detect the psychological content of the movie. For a foreigner, much of the movie is exotic. Yet the more exotic a movie is for a viewer, the easier it is for him to spot the aspects of it which are familiar, which are fundamentally human and independent of culture. Hence, foreigners are in advantage when it comes to noticing the psychology of the movie. This paradox, again, fits nicely with the trickster character of Rashomon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A difficult film in many ways, and utterly original and precise in its construction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rashomon (1950)This is a storyteller's movie, where the same event is told successively by several different people (including a spirit) who were (we assume) there to witness it. Each accounting, by various characters (earthy or refined, depending) of the same crime is what gets you thinking, but it also gives each segment a flavor of its own. The concept of stories not matching, despite their common facts, is one of the truths of truth's impossibility. This is the core and the fame of this somewhat forced movie.Rashomon demands, and rewards, thinking. Each of the four main accounts are reflections of the needs of the teller. While there are some traditionally Japanese issues (of honor, both from a male and female perspective), non-Japanese audiences can get it, too. There are mannerisms that are not only Japanese (and therefore foreign to others) but are old-fashioned even for contemporary audiences, kind of like watching Robin Hood, where it takes a little getting used to the style. The sword fights, in particular, seem oddly incompetent in fighting terms. But not at all in cinema terms--they are films with amazing beauty.Kurosawa always found camera operators with real vigor and visual finesse (both!) playing with shadows and light, and moving with a three dimensional logic to the figures in the space. You can, in a movie, like this, almost turn off the subtitles and just watch, and if you lose the details, you get the overall power of it all. It is traditionally "beautiful" with all the shadows and light, and is also compositionally strong, even as it moves through space. Exceptionally so.If you haven't seen this, you might be put off by its lack of a regular old story. I know I am, every time I see it. I never quite get absorbed, because by the second telling I know that I am witnessing a "version" of what happened, relative to the first. It's incredibly fascinating, but not always engaging in the usual way. Clearly a masterpiece in every sense, and a breakthrough for Kurosawa.</fullReview>

In medieval Japan, four people have different versions of a violent incident, when a bandit (Toshiro Mifune) attacks a nobleman (Masayuki Mori) in the forest.Indescribably vivid in itself, and genuinely strange (one of the versions is told by a ghost), Rashomon reintroduced Japanese films to the world market and was remade (badly) in Hollywood as The Outrage in 1964. But its device of an incident re-told from different perspectives and memories is so potent and compelling that it has echoes in any number of subsequent films. The film won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, and also received an Academy Honorary Award at the 24th Academy Awards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is the 2nd Kurosawa movie i am seeing in two days,after dreams this... and i must confess that i have become his ardent fan...his style of movie making is so grass root,so natural,so immaculate!!this movie is a thriller and also has a deep psychological meaning!two gruesome crimes- a rape and a murder has taken place and four people give four contradictory accounts of the events taken place that day!if it would have been any other director the whole movie would have been left in suspense of knowing what is the 'truth',but Kurosawa didn't show us the truth..and herein lies the essence of the movie ....;the point is not to decipher the truth from the facts given but rather to see how the facts has been twisted by each witness to lie to themselves that they are not guilty!!and this is the thing that is to be learned from this movie...that we subconsciously twist facts to suit ourselves!!the movie may be repulsive to some new movie watchers..i would not recommend it to them!but for all cinema lovers its a MUST WATCH10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rashomon (1950) **** (out of 4)A man is murdered and at the trial various stories are told of what really happened. This was only my second film from Akira Kurosawa and I enjoyed it more than The Seven Samurai and I'd probably put it down as one of the greatest ever made. I knew the film's reputation going in but after reading the plot I really wasn't expecting too much but each passing minute the film just kept getting better and better. The ending was quite chilling and depressing but at the same time very uplifting. I'll have to think a bit more about the film's message towards human nature but it's always good when a film makes you think after it's over with. The performances by the entire cast are among the greatest I've ever seen and especially the work done by Toshiro Mifune. The cinematography is also quite beautiful and perfectly captures the mood of the film. I'm sure I'll have more to say about this film after it sits in a bit more because the emotions it left running through me are still quite fresh and looking for a few more answers. Either way this is a brilliant film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do only classic movies get away with bad acting?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a major issue that not enough critics of modern day are addressing. The major issue has actually plagued this critic for quite some time, and now the straw that broke the camel's back pretty much lies in this movie. Why on earth can classic movies get away with bad acting? Why is it that if the movie is old, and in black-and-white, it is forgiven and receives the green card whenever lines are delivered badly or the acting does not become believable in the least bit. An excellent story has been ruined and tainted by bad acting yet again, and it's time that more critics become harsher to these old flicks rather than uphold them to the highest degree. Who cares if they are groundbreaking? Groundbreaking does not mean incredible. The very first first-person shooter video game is a slow-placed repetitive little game called Faceball 2000. It is the first of its kind, but that does not make it great.Rashomon is a superbly told story, yet acting hampers the experience. Does it matter? It should, excellent films, films that receive perfect scores are those that excel in all levels, not just a few. Movies like Shawshank Redemption, Empire Strikes Back, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Forrest Gump did not just succeed in storytelling: they had a great blend of acting, cinematography, editing, music, sound, and pacing. Rashomon does not deserve its status as one of the best films ever simply because it did not deliver in all aspects of film-making. It's time that we begin to criticize instead of just quietly accept all shortcomings of older films like Casablanca, Wizard of Oz (e.s.p.e.c.i.a.l.l.y), and this unique flick.In Rashomon, we follow three people that are caught in a downpour, two of them reliving the events of a trail in disbelief. Then the events of the trial and the events leading up to the trial are being told in different perspectives, each of them with their own truths, but also their own faults. It is up to the viewer, who unexpectedly plays the role as the judge, to fit the pieces together and craft the true story as to what really happened. The narrative in this movie is very jumbled and out of order; the first of its kind in any film-making. This would influence tons of later classic movies and television shows like Pulp Fiction, Annie Hall, The Usual Suspects, The Simpsons, Lost, and Memento. The script is excellent and well ahead of its time with highly-structured pacing, timing, and dialogue (even if some might be lost in translation). Written and directed by the famed Akira Kurosawa, this movie is the defining example of how Kurosawa's experimental work influenced the way we see movies for decades to come.The camera-work isn't consistent or repetitive, which keeps the movie at the edge of your seat. Whether its long shots of characters realizing a harsh truth, or swooping shots of scenery, the cinematography is also ahead of its league. Kurosawa keeps the pacing quick, and also is very detailed in his shots, which enhances the experience. He truly was one of the better directors in the first half of the 20th century. Unlike the predictable works of modern times, you couldn't really figure out just what happened on that fateful day until the very end, when all was revealed in front of your eyes. The clues were there, but it requires multiple viewings to piece them all to a coherent tale.However the movie hits the deep end with the acting, which for some reason critics find forgivable. How come movies of today can't get away with bad acting and badly delivered dialogue, but older movies like this can? Kurosawa may be a good director, and it's obvious he has a knack for details, but he should not have saved some of the footage of the actors. The worst ones include Machiko Kyô who plays the wife, and Toshirô Mifune who played the thief accused of murder. They both made the drama laughable, which is a shame considering the emotional intensity of the story. For whatever reason, they really screwed up in certain points. This cannot just go away softly, there is good acting in older films, but not all of it is good. It is not fair to the actors and actresses of today to receive such heat when films like this don't. That's the main and pretty much only gripe of this film, but it's a major one. Everything else, from the cinematography to the writing to even the musical score, was superb.Bottom Line: The movie touched on a theme about hypocrites (just slightly), and it's time that critics like Ebert, the entire ensemble of Entertainment Weekly and New York Times, and especially the American Film Institute should look into that a bit more. They are all hypocrites. This movie has an excellent story, and does indeed break some new ground in terms of making movies, but does it deserve a nomination into the top films of all-time because of it? No, not at all. The acting should have been much better, and Kurosawa should have whether a) hired other people or b) forced them to perform better. Strip away the bad acting, and we have ourselves easily one of the best movies of the 1900s. Sadly this isn't the case, and the movie overall loses points because of it. Nonetheless, everyone, whether aspiring filmmakers or someone who wants a good story should see this, because a beautifully woven story full of lessons and themes about humanity can be discovered here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original Multiple Narrative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most plot driven Kurosawa film I have yet to see, great performances and cinematography, and the best actual sword fighting I have yet to see in any of his films, but the ending was a bit of a let down I didn't quite fulfill the really ominous tension that was built up at the beginning of the film and all throughout. I suppose the split narratives were then a really amazing innovation, but they are now somewhat commonplace, and today they sort of dragged a bit, after the first one which was the most exciting. The thematic ideas of the film were brilliant, as is the film itself, it's just dated now. Still a worthy view for anyone interested in film history in general(there's a unfortunate tendency in the states to treat "foreign films" as a genre, separate from American films or "movies"), Kurosawa, or in sociology and psychology, where I've heard this film referenced more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, complex, engaging.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the earliest, if not earliest, widely known and acclaimed Akira Kurosawa masterpiece and is his best known work next to "Shichinin no samurai", "Kakushi-toride no san-akunin" and "Yojimbo". This is for a very good reason, for "Rashômon" is one of Kurosawa's best works. It's beautiful, multiple layered and thought provoking.The movie is complex and multiple layered but the story itself is quite simple. Bascicly it's the same story, about how a Samurai got killed, only told from three and eventually four different perspectives. Each story is different and shows a different take on what really happened. In the end the movie leaves us guessing which story is the truth and it doesn't pick sides. Each story told from a character's perspective, is told by the characters to mainly make themselves look as honorable and good as possible. Therefor every story feels just as credible and not credible as the other. There is no truth, at least not an objective one in this movie. And there lies the complexity of the movie. This movie works as a reflecting one and shows us how men lie and deceit for their own good. It shows us the selflessness, we eventually all poses. It's a straight-forward and honest movie about the more ugly-side of mankind. This is what the movie is about and not about what the real truth in this case is.Some of the stories show some similarities but also differ completely at the same time. It makes all of the stories interesting to watch. It's not like it gets boring or overdone after about two stories, every story is just as engaging and surprising as the other. Through the way of storytelling it becomes obvious that none of them are fully true and are told by the character them make themselves look as honorable and good as possible, like I already mentioned before. It makes you ponder why the character tell their story the way they do and what will be gained by them, rather than thinking about it who's story is the most credible one. It forces us to picture ourselves in the characters their minds. It makes "Rashômon" one of the most thought provoking and engaging movies out of history. You can always leave it up to Kurosawa to make a simple story multiple layered and thought provoking. This movie shows storytelling at its very best!The movie is made with lots of style. Of course the directing is top-class but so is the interesting and refreshing cinematography and the musical score. It all helps to make the settings and sets look even more beautiful than they already were.All of the actors also give a fine performance, especially Toshirô Mifune and Masayuki Mori, who also play the most important parts of the movie.An one of a kind Kurosawa movie and masterpiece that shows storytelling at the most beautiful, complex and engaging way possible.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first master piece of Kurosawa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rashômon (1950)By the time that Kurosawa was shooting Rashomon, other genius film makers were involved in crucial projects: Luis Bu?uel was filming "Los Olvidados" (1950), Ingmar Bergman was writing the screenplay for "Summer Interlude" (1951) and filming two full length movies ("To Joy" and "High tension", both in 1950) and Federico Fellini was shooting his first film "Variety Lights" (1950). Probably was only a fortunate coincidence that four of the best filmmakers ever were involved in very personal and decisive project in the early stages of their careers. It's important to mention that by those days the Italian Neo-realism was clearly the most dominating and extended film movement. In the international film festivals a lot of pictures in that style were awarded and directors like Visconti, Rosellini and De Sica were considered the top of the list. But in 1950 something happened and changed the film industry forever. Bergman was acclaimed by his early works and the 1950 projects and the decisive film "Summer interlude" (with the Sweden star Maj-Britt Nilsson) meant for him enough budget to start shooting other more personal movies. His first major film was filmed three years later (Summer with Monika (1953) with his first collaboration with Harriett Andersson) and since then, Bergman had one of the most admirable film productions. Bu?uel, on the other hand, was filming his first personal project since "the golden age" (1930). The film received an award of Cannes festival for best direction. (For further information about this film refer to my comment in "Los Olvidados"). Fellini by his side had a well received debut with his first film and a young actress was awarded with an acting price (Gulietta Massina, Fellini's wife). The three of them had very solid and world acclaimed film careers. But I would like to talk in more detail about Kurosawa's first major film: Rashomon.In 1947, Kurosawa met Toshiro Mifune (the most important actor for Kurosawa, along with Takashi Shimura). In his book "Something like an autobiography", the Japanese director mentioned the impact that was to met Mifune. He described the young actor as a strong presence, with hard character and natural acting skills. Actually Mifune and Shimura had a collaboration with Kurosawa in the 1947 film "Ginrei no hate". By 1950, Kurosawa invited those two actors again and left the main male character to Mifune. The result is brilliant. A murder story involving three persons (one woman, two men). The film started at Rashomon (a ruined temple) during a rainy afternoon. Two persons were sheltered there and a third one arrives. Then, one of them (The woodcutter, played by Shimura) started to tell a very confusing story. He was walking into the woods and found some personal objects and a body. Then we can see the trial (where only the witnesses are visible) and the woodcutter version was heard. During the movie, the director change from the scene in the rainy temple to the trial several times. Then we can hear the version of Tajomaru (Mifune), a well known thief and he described his version as a love and honor tale. He was touched by the woman and cheats the other man in order to possess her. At the end, the killing took place after a samurai style combat between the two men. Then we witness the woman and the death character's (through some magic conjure) versions. Every story is totally different from the other. In one, Tajomaru is a brave and fair warrior, in other is a villain with no feelings, in other is a coward. Beautiful sequences where we can see the same action viewed and told by four different characters. At the end the woodcutter told the real version (totally opposite from the others) to the stranger and at that stage of the movie is very difficult to know which version is the truth or at least the closest. The decision is on us. The final sequence with the baby is magnificent and the acting performances (especially from Mifune) are superb. All the characters took the human emotions and feelings in a very emotive way, the existential questions are present all the time and this simple history is told beautifully by this great Japanese director.The film received the golden lion award in the 1951 Venice film festival along with the Italian film critics award. One urban legend said that the category for best foreign movie was created after the honorary Oscar given to the film in 1952. This is, with no doubts the first Kurosawa's master piece. After this, several major films were produced during the 50's through the 90's under Kurosawa's direction. A must see movie and reference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A work of art!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is Kurosawa at his artistic best. It's not a story of events, it's a study of people - a comment on human nature. The husband, his wife, the bandit who kills him and rapes her and the woodcutter who finds the dead body - and each one's version of the events that transpired. This is the medium Kurosawa chooses to portray a facet of human nature - "What is an individual's perception of truth? What determines it? What are its ramifications on one's life?"The content apart, Rashomon also represents a huge technical achievement on Kurosawa's part - the format in which the story is told is refreshingly original and a delight to watch. Every frame oozes with meaning and stands testament to Kurosawa's aesthetic sense. One of the greatest movies ever made!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Akira Kurosawa has shown all his power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's official. With this movie, Akira Kurosawa has proved he is one of the greatest film directors in the history. Ilked so much this adaptation, its very simple, but also very well-treated; the actors were great and also the screenplay. First I must say that Kurosawa took a short story from Ryunosuke Akutagawa and extracted all its elements: The Era, the clothes, the traditions, the houses and the bad face of the people, in order to make an excellent movie; all the atmosphere can take the watcher into the Edo time (a bit more ancient than Tokugawa, and introduce us into the realistic environment of that time: the scenery and the photography is another thing that we can include, the sunshines and the forest were some of the best parts, and Kurosawa knew how to balance them. For the other part, Toshiro Mifune should be called "The Japanese Marlon Brando"; I mean, he made an excellent Tajomaru, a dirty, but serious thief; many times I thought he was really like that, perhaps one can't see if he is acting or not, and that's something that gives credibility to the movie; the part in which he was tied in the court, just like a dog, is so impressive; I wonder if that was part of medieval Japanese customs, or if both Akutagawa and Kurosawa made that for show a symbolism. ?The Actress! She was also brilliant, I don't know her name, but he creates an excellent, pathetic, weak and coward character; the way he escaped form Tajomaru showed her fear, her cowardliness, and also the infidelity: First she was with the husband, but then, passed to Tajomaru. ?How Pathetic! The character is "double-faced" and I love it, and so the actress. Finally, the best part of the screenplay, is that Rashomon is not just a story, but a lot of stories, seeing by each character's eyes: Each tells what they remember about the murder. And all of these are full of reflections about humanity, oneself, the others. Love, loyalty, madness, and great style of samurai fight between two man. In spite of all my comments, however, I must accept that I had problems identifying all these elements, but now since I enter deeply on the movie; all I have to say is that the film industry could not survive without Rashomon. But there are a lot of movies that we still have to see, such as "The Last Tango in Paris", from Bernardo Bertolucci, and "The Last Emperor" as well, but have faith. Watch movies, and decide if they are one of the greatest or not: the cinema and literature are very identical anyway. Technically are different, I know, but deep inside, they show art, story, love, passion, and tradition, from the countries or from the director's vision.Thank you Mr. Kurosawa, for sharing your talent with the world, and thank you Mr. Mifune, for let us know your unmoral name.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good introduction to a legendary directors works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only managed to find a VHS copy from the local public library that was of very poor sound quality and had to view it on an old VCR with a small Television set. But the poor sound on the Television was helped a great deal as the rain was puring outside which was perfect for the opening scenes, that almost gave me a surround system. I will probably add it to my Kurosawa collection on DVD when I can get ahold of a copy.I have not seen much of Kurosawas early work and found this classic to be interesting, beautiful with a universal story and in all the different stories the actors performances and Kurosawas settings are at times the work of a masterpiece and the music n the movie is great. My limited knowledge of kabuki theater might make my grade a little lower than the movie deserves. Perhaps by viewing this movie more times I will rate this movie higher.I can recommend this movie for those out there who are interested in the works one of the greatest directors of are times. It is a good introduction to his work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revolutionary idea - at the time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just recently started watching Kurosawa and so far I have thoroughly enjoyed his films. I appreciate Kurosawa for his craftsmanship, for his skillful shots and beautiful compositions. I realize that he was hugely influential on directors that came after him, and I can appreciate elements in his films that, while typical today, were inventive for the time. All that being said, Rashomon, for me, boils down to this: it was the first time in either film or television that the audience was presented with different versions of the same set of events. In the end you don't really know what happened, and the various possibilities, combined with your uncertainty about them, are supposed to hit you with a kind of bleak power, subsequently tempered with the (if I may say) rather blunt hope of a man taking in an abandoned baby. The problem is (for me, at least) that the notion of relative reality is pervasive in today's culture. It is neither a surprise, nor a shock, nor a revelation. After all, wasn't it the author Nabokov, roughly contemporary with Kurosawa, who said 'reality' is the only word that should never be used without quotation marks? There is a shot in Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" where the bandits are seen cresting the hill in the distance before they descend on the village. That kind of shot has been imitated so many times today that you don't even notice it, but it was a genuine first in "Seven Samurai." The shot is a few seconds long, and you can think to yourself "wow, that really was a great idea" for a few seconds, and then the movie continues. The problem with Rashomon is that that same thought it supposed to sustain your attention and substantiate your appreciation for the duration of the film. And even if it is 2 hours shorter than "Seven Samurai," 90 minutes is a long time to be constantly reminding yourself that Kurosawa invented what has become a fully integrated concept in modern film and television (think: Law and Order). Kurosawa certainly did a competent job, but unfortunately, Rashomon is not a case where the first is also the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa has been described as one of Japan's most accessible directors for the Western audience and this is often quoted as one of his finest hours, along with the more famous 'Seven Samurai'. In my opinion it is vastly overrated.Admittedly, it is a fascinating premise that drives 'Rashomon'. Shirking traditional narrative structure in a manner that would later inspire such films as 'The Usual Suspects' and to a lesser extent 'Go' and 'Run Lola Run', 'Rashomon' has the same story (of banditry, rape and murder) told from several different perspectives, all conflicting and causing the viewer to constantly reassess each character. However the potential of this concept is completely undermined by some truly unfathomable motives on the part of the main protagonists. Some of their actions are completely inexplicable and this isn't helped by some woeful overacting by Toshiro Mifune and Machiko Kyo. The whole plot spirals further into the preposterous and then suddenly becomes a debate about the twisting of truth driven by motive that, like the monk's character, was unnecessarily preachy. A special mention must be reserved for the sword fights which are some of the most amateurish ever filmed.This could have been terrific if the storyline had remained sensible; thankfully the one thing the film has going for it, the structure, has been salvaged by the movie world so it is not a total waste.</fullReview>

This was obviously not even intended. The point of Rashomon is to show how people CANNOT ADMIT THEIR MISTAKES. We will do anything to deny the truth from themselves because the truth is too painful for most to bear. Rashomon's genius is in presenting this theme; sadly, most people are unable to grasp it (or maybe they don't want to...)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of the great classics of film and will be on virtually every film critics top 100 list if not better.The subject of the story is the investigation of a murder and the perspectives of each of the witnesses to the event, including the murderer and even (with the help of a "medium") from the perspective of the victim. Each of the characters sincerely believes that what they are telling is "the truth". They all agree on the victim and the perpetrator but none of their stories agree beyond this point.Never before had a director so explicitly approached the subject of the relativity of truth. Not because "truth" does not exist but rather because of the fact that each of us is limited by our own bias and limited viewpoint. Each of us lacks omniscience, because of this 'truth' everything we experience will be colored by the limitations of our belief systems.Additionally, the cinematography is superb. Kurosawa, like Ansel Adams, would not present a picture unless everything was exactly where he wanted it to be. Few directors have ever approached the precision of Kurosawa's vision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Japanese cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>May contain spoilers!!!I'll be honest, this is the first Japanese film I've ever seen, but I'm hungry for more, particularly those directed by Kurosawa.Rashomon is set in Medieval Japan, (exactly when is not stated, and irrelevant), and revolves around the murder of a nobleman and the rape of his wife. The story is related by four separate people, and is being discussed by three men sheltering at Rashomon Gate from torrential rain. The stories are told by the suspect, (a bandit), the murdered mans wife, a woodcutter, (a witness to the murder), and the dead man himself through a medium. Each story is different and all have reasons for lying. During the court scenes the judge is never seen, and the witnesses are facing the audience. Therefore the viewers themselves are the judge.Key differences are in the fight scenes between the bandit and the nobleman; in the bandit's story they stage a skilled, heroic battle, whilst the woodcutter describes a shambolic fight where both men are weak and untalented.Who is the killer? You decide.Key to this film is the cinematography which distinguishes the film from mainstream Hollywood movies. The fight scenes seem long and drawn out due to a mostly static camera, with none of the modern fast editing associated with Hollywood action films. This does appear to slow the film down, but I don't feel that this is to its detriment. Those who have described the film as 'too long' should note that the running time is only around 85 minutes.This film put Japanese cinema on the world map, and deservedly so. Kurosawa is without doubt the greatest Japanese director, and is often credited with 'auteur' status. I would personally agree despite the fact that I have only seen this one film, but in the course of my studies I will see more of his work.I really enjoyed this film for its open ending which leaves so much to individual interpretation. The ending is more optimistic, marked by the ceasation of the metaphorical rain that had set the mood of the film up to this point. Cultural differences must be overlooked, and it must also be remembered that this film is now over half a century old, as it should not be judged by its dated appearance.I hope people enjoy this film, and look deeper than its surface. There is a lot to be found.9/10</fullReview>

Even if Kurosawa had never made another movie he would be remembered forever for making this. Everything about it is perfect, but I particularly admire the actors involved. Toshiro Mifune who plays the bandit is one of the most charismatic actors to ever step in front of a camera, but the rest of the cast are also excellent. I don't think there's a false note in any of their performances. The plot concerns four differing accounts of a rape and a murder, and will leave you fascinated and puzzled. Too many unworthy movies get labelled "masterpieces" in my opinion, but 'Rashomon' really deserves the title. It comes with my very highest recommendation, and I assure you that it is simply one of THE best you'll ever see in your life!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rashomon is a movie well ahead of it's time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kurosawa's Rashomon was the precursor to many popular films. The idea of telling a story from several different viewpoints is both interesting and genius, especially considering that this film was released in the 1950s. Kurosawa's pacing may leave many of today's viewers "bored", but as far as I am concerned, cutting from one camera to another each second of a film (like an MTV video) is not boring. I hope to see more of Kurosawa's films, especially if they are as well written, and directed as this one. I will keep this revue short, since I now need to run to the video store to rent "Seven Samurai", and "Ran".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoughtful, stylish old classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the original Crouching Tiger, really opening up the minds of Western audiences to the delights of oriental movies, and it's still a bit of an eye-opener. The slightly surreal visuals, lots of symbolic-looking shots of masks lying cracked on the ground, sparsely shot courtroom scenes and that awesome rainfall around the storytellers, set you up for a mad story set in some woods on the road to Yamashina, where a group of mentalists have gone a bit mental and one of them ended up dead. The style of the storytelling, with all the flashbacks and restructured scenes, is really an essential part of the tale itself (based on a story by Akutagawa Ryunosuke, taken from his Rashomon collection) but Kurosawa can be credited with bringing a good few new ideas and crazy tricks to the cinema with this monster hit classic. The tiny cast all act out of their skins, especially the bandit Toyomaru, laughing like a crazed hyena all the way through, the ideas and sentiments expressed are fascinating and ultimately beautiful, and all it all it pretty much deserves its status as top classic Japanese thing. Great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The husband, the wife...or the bandit?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In ancient Japan, a woman is raped and her husband killed. The film gives us four viewpoints of the incident - one for each defendant - each revealing a little more detail. Which version, if any, is the real truth about what happened?I was looking forward to this film because I love the concept of POV films, even this, which I believe started the whole thing. Well, that's the problem. If this was the first POV I've ever seen, which is certainly not the case here, I would probably have loved it like everyone else. Well, I've seen many more POV films before this, like "Vantage Point," which takes the same idea but uses it in a more sophisticated way.The whole POV thing in here is pretty simple and really easy to understand and I was disappointed in that. I just expected more. More complicated things. Small significances that I wouldn't have noticed the first time when watching the film a lot more. But no, it's just a simple plot compared to the other films which took the idea and turned it into a much more complicated way.Away from that, the film was still good, especially close to the end. I just don't like that the film had a lot of unintentional laughs because of some horrible acted scenes and some amateurish directing. However, they're all tolerable. Overall, it's nothing big compared to films with the same idea released these days so don't keep your expectations high.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Kurosawa flick--but see other films by this director as well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first film by Akira Kurosawa to be seen in theaters in the US, as it was an international success. And, while this is a very good film, I think that sometimes too much emphasis is placed on this film and not enough on all his other great films. While some of Kurosawa's fans might agree to the exact order, they will also acknowledge that many other films are nearly as good or better (such as THRONE OF BLOOD, THE SEVEN SAMURAI, YOJIMBO, and many others--along with is wonderful NON-samurai movies such as HIGH AND LOW, IKURU and SCANDAL).The story itself is extremely creative, as it tells the same story three different times all through the eyes of three different characters. Just when you THINK you know the story, it's told again by a different person with a totally different perspective--revealing all new details or contradicting what you already thought. A recent wonderful movie that also does this is Audry Tautou's HE LOVES ME HE LOVES ME NOT.Beautfully written, slowly revealed, expertly acted--this is an exceptional but not the best Japanese film I have seen. It's too bad most of those out there haven't been exposed to more Japanese cinema to know this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A priest and a woodcutter recount the story during a rainstorm to a passing traveler. The woodcutter discovers a dead man in the woods. Three days later, he tells it to the court. The priest had run into the samurai and his wife before the murder. Known bandit Tajômaru is captured and tells his story of raping the willing wife but kills the husband only after the wife begs him. The wife testifies with a different story where the bandit leaves after the rape. Her husband was still alive but he is found dead later on after she fainted. Then a medium calls up the spirit of the samurai to testify during the trial with yet another version of the incident.This is definitely something unique for the time. The storytelling method has been used by many others over the years. This movie works fine but the tension isn't quite high enough. Each version is not self-serving enough and I don't really like the medium being used. Kurosawa is breaking new ground here but it's not the most intense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Rashômon" is a mystery movie in which we watch three people talking about an incident and they say three different stories of what happened. We have a priest, a woodcutter and another man who are taking refuge from a rainstorm in the shell of a former gatehouse which is called Rashômon. The incident that happened had as a result the death of one person and the difference between these three stories are the motivations and the actual killing.I liked this movie because of the plot and the whole storyline of it which combined mystery with crime and of course drama. The direction of this movie which made of the master Akira Kurosawa was simply outstanding. Also the interpretation of Toshirô Mifune who played as Tajômaru was for one more time really good, and equally good was the interpretation of Masayuki Mori who played as Takehiro Kanazawa. In this I want to say that I did not like the interpretation of Machiko Kyô who played as Masako Kanazawa because I believe that she overreacted in some moments something that I found a bit disturbing.Finally I have to say that "Rashômon" is one of the best movies made by Akira Kurosawa and it can be compared only with "Shichinin no samurai" which is a brilliant movie as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Stunning Use Of Mise-En-Scene.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rashomon" (1950), is extremely effective in its minimalist qualities and stunning cinematography (American Director. Robert Altman extremely admired this picture, his opinion is worth looking into). Whereas I enjoyed this movie overall, unfortunately I couldn't say I adored it as much as I have Kurosawa's later work (Or even earlier works I've yet to see them).In a day of particular heavy rain, a commoner takes shelter beneath a city gate with two other individuals. These two men are definitely fazed by a disturbing story that took place, where the woodcutter (The wonderful Takashi Shimura) tells that he found the body of a Samurai in the forest and went to alert the authorities. So begins a trial as we hear multiple interpretations from each individuals, the woodcutter, the deceased Samurai (Through a medium), the Samurai's wife and ultimately that of the bandit (The iconic Toshiro Mifune)."Rashomon", outside its narrative has many appeals. It was the first Japanese film to make it big on the International circuit and coined the real life term "The Rashomon Effect", where multiple individuals deliver conflicting information. The pacing throughout it's running length is stunning, and the way they used mirrors to reflect natural light really gives the picture untold depths of beauty. I think the acting on all fronts is pretty decent, but some of Machiko Ky&#x14d;'s performance as the Samurai's wife took me out of the seriousness of the situation.Final Verdict: It's over 60 years old and even though I don't highly regard it as much as his other work, Akira Kurosawa's "Rashomon" still remains proudly influential. It's been analysed to death and some of those theories are downright absurd, but as our story suggests the true nature of actual events is lost among interpretation. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Akira Kurasawa was a genius of a filmmaker in his time, and this is the movie that really introduced him to the wider audience in North America. It's a quick, fast paced, sword fighting drama all about truth, and really if anyone tells it.Its basically allegorical for how we are as humans. The story and major crime is told by four different accounts, and even by the end of the film we don't even know what the truth is. But as Kurasawa has shown us, that's not the point. The point is to show that nobody really does anything for the good of others. We all really do everything for ourselves. Even as far fetched as it may seem, it's partially true I guess. We are always trying to improve our worth to how others really see us.There were a few parts that took me out of it. One being the whole idea that the husband can talk 'through another medium' as a way of telling his side of the story wasn't believable at all. It was a bit goofy for what was otherwise a very serious film. And even for how short it was its a film that is easily re-watchable.In my opinion, it's better than Yojimbo but not as good as the all time classic Seven Samurai. Great film nonetheless.8.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rashomon - Technology meets art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rashomon, a movie which can be categorized under the term "Movie ahead of its time". Few movie can only be categorized in such a way and only very few movies in that category entertains us, Rashomon is one among the very few movies which can be derived from the list of few movies.It is one of the finest movie which really collaborated art and technology in a good sense. Both art and technology was two different poles at 1950, but Akira Kurosowa managed to bring both the poles as close as possible and he succeeded in it too. It's really inevitable to applaud the director, cinematographer, and editor in assorting the both, without any flaws and confusions for the time the movie was made.Story was very simple and straightforward, one incident in different perspective by different people with different attitudes. But we never know which one among the four is true. Director simply wanted us to conclude the story or to put our own imagination to bring out the fifth view.Screenplay was crisp, a horrifying incident followed by a court room drama where the four different perspective unfolds. Each perspective of the incident contradicts with other in all aspects and makes us difficult to judge the truth. Its not about truth, its more about the cruelty of human nature. You really cannot juxtapose the different pieces together to find a solution.Technically, movie was so good for the time the movie was made. It would have enthralled the audience at the time of release, how Avatar did to us. This is the first movie to shoot the sun directly. The long shots and hand held camera views will surely make you wonder about the cinematography and the way it has been handled.Casting was almost perfect, except the priest. Of course I do not have any idea about the look of priest in Japan during 12th century. Tajomaru was fantastic in his acting and body language, the best actor in the movie. He reminded me of Joker in many places (Not just because he laughed). The way his acting throughout the movie was too good and he stays in our mind even after watching the movie.Movie opened with few lines which says that the movie was preserved. I can tell you that there is nothing wrong in preserving the movie at all. A very good movie with fantastic mix of technology which shows the cruelty of nature in a different way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best possible movie about its subject matter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am of the opinion that rape should never be the subject of a movie. Perhaps a documentary, or perhaps if the director or writer had been the victim of rape and wanted to address their experience through the medium of film. Bottom line, it should be a hell of a lot more rare as a plot device than it currently is. That said, "Rashomon" is a good, thoughtful film despite the fact that it revolves around a rape scene. The rape itself is wisely not shown nor illustrated in any particularly graphic way. It could not have been, not only because censorship in Japan and the United States at the time would likely have prohibited it, but because uncertainty about what exactly took place between a bandit, a samurai, and the samurai's wife is essential to the plot. Through flashbacks we see several different versions of what may have happened, and each new piece of the puzzle prompts a priest and an old woodcutter to reflect on the sorry state of human existence as they wait out a rainstorm beneath a ruined gate. Strong performances by regular Kurosawa actors Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura make this perhaps the most tasteful and artful movie about a rape, if such a thing is possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review : Rashomon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The true irony in Rashomon is that the only person whose guilt is proved is that of the narrator's, despite the fact that majority of the film involves its three central characters claiming responsibility for one crime. While the focal point of Rashomon involves unraveling the event involving the death of a Samurai where the Samurai himself, his wife and a bandit claim to be the culprit, the film isn't a clue-solving mystery where new revelations in subsequent scenes make it easier for us to judge who the criminal is; instead, Rashomon places us in the jury box with its characters appealing to us one by one and the only way we can reach to any decision is through moral considerations. Can the wife be a woman of such loose morals that she immediately agrees to elope with the bandit and asks him coldly to shoot her husband? Can the husband be so stone-hearted that he rejects his helpless wife because she has been raped? Can a bandit be smooth enough to woo the married lady with just a kiss? It is hard to find a concrete answer because a) believing one version would be discarding the other equally credible versions and b) in each version we find the characters supporting the unexpected person ( for example, the samurai's version is more sympathetic to the bandit than his own wife). What makes the tale more complex is that there's another narrator who's retelling the different versions of the three characters. Later, it is his crime which is revealed and positively true, unlike the ambiguity of the murder case. In this way, Rashomon is revelatory as a film whose acclaim and relevance has lasted over the years because of its universally understood themes. I remember having gone for a local play held at the city hall about a year ago only because my friends were included in its cast and crew. I hurriedly slid out of the theater during interval because I couldn't endure the play anymore and I didn't want to lie to the cast, who'd called me backstage, about how much the play sucked. A year later, I rented Rashomon through a movie rental store and saw it at home. That day is today, and why I'm mentioning about a year-old play is that I realized that it was based entirely on Rashomon! Unlike the film, the play however was overburdened in dialog and reduced to shambles by substandard acting and technical achievements. I 'RAN' out the second the curtains dropped for interval (hope you get the silly capitalized pun. It's improvised!). Rashomon on the other hand has fewer dialogues, more pantomime and is a great technical achievement; it opens up like Orson Welles' Citizen Kane, giving us very long shots of rain pattering down the city gate and slowly taking us inside, closing in on its two actors who are first seen at a distance from the camera's eye. Even the opening line in both Kane and Rashomon has the same function of defining the crux of the film; while you hear the protagonist Kane going 'Rosebud', Rashomon has the character of the woodcutter uttering "I just don't understand", not once but four different times. He has four conflicting versions of the same incident to tell, first from the point of view of its three characters and lastly himself. The companion sitting beside him is a priest who's also a witness to the incident, albeit a minor one. The film needs somebody apart from us to whom the story has to be told, and so a third character is introduced. Taking shelter from the rain, he enters the city gate and finds the two men sitting sullenly as the woodcutter murmurs his opening lines. With brazen intrusiveness, he asks the woodcutter what he can't understand, and then proceeds to question the priest like he can't mind his own business. But that's the catalyst for the woodcutter, our narrator for the rest of the film, to begin with the incident that's been bothering him for long.He starts by telling about the body of a samurai he found while walking through the woods, and then proceeds to share everything that happened in court (with no jury except us and maybe the skies). The stage is taken by the bandit first, who's been accused of killing a travelling samurai and raping his wife. The samurai gives an account that glorifies his deeds and presents him in the light he'd like to see himself in ?as a cold-blooded murderer who also entices the samurai's wife. The wife gives her account then, which reminded me of the tale Ramayana from Indian mythology; in it, Lord Ram's wife Seeta is abducted by Raavan, and after Ram defeats his sworn enemy, he brings Seeta back home but banishes her reluctantly after his subjects suspect her chastity. Here the samurai looks at his wife, who's been raped, with a look of contempt that frightens her and compels her to plunge the dagger into his heart. It is the dead samurai's version we hear next through a medium, and finally we hear the wood-cutter's own version. And while the woodcutter's tale would seem the most trustworthy at first, he being a stranger to the three characters, his words can't be relied upon wholly after we learn that he too may have something to hide. Even the sum of parts cannot make a whole in Rashomon as the sum itself has fluctuating variables. Instead of acting sleuth and trying to solve the case, watch the contrast in the personalities of the three characters through the four versions. You'll find yourself pulled into Rashomon's story until you can't tell what's true and what's not. And when you find yourself saying "I just don't understand", you got what Rashomon is all about; you weren't even a witness to the incident, so how would you expect to know the truth?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Released back in 1950, 'Rashomon' is considered one of Akira Kurowasa's best films and is regarded one of the best foreign movies by the greatest foreign director of all time.My first experience with Akira Kurasawa was with 'Yojimbo' which I found plain awesome and amazing! I was very excited to see this movie and so, going into it wasn't sure whether I'd like a Japanese mystery movie.'Rashomon' has a very basic premise to it with a story regarding a woman and his husband's murder being recounted by various people. Despite such basic premise, the movie is simply far more than just that and is such a mindbending yet such a challenging movie to watch. It is a strange movie and the eeriness is masterfully portrayed by the opening scene. This scene set me up for what I believed to be a truly amazing mystery movie.There were many things I loved about this film. The characters were definitely great, the story was interesting, the direction was great and the dialogue was well written, considering having to read subtitles for 90 minutes.I did like certain viewpoints and recounts by different people but just after the one hour mark, I was beginning to get a little wreckless as I felt the movie just shifted and a bit of the greatness dropped. I was beginning to lose my interest and some of the scenes did feel weird but there was so much good things towards the very end that dragged me back into the film. One was the duel between the Samurai and the bandit. The woodchopper's story was great as was the bandit's story but boy, I felt the woman's story to get a little dull and just awkward.Some things that happened in the film such as the girl screaming in a horror like creepy way did creep me out. The eerie tone was certainly there, the movie is mostly intense and interesting and for most of its 90 minute length, I was drawn into the movie.Ten slow minutes of the film doesn't make it a horrible film or a mediocre movie as this is paid off by generally amazing story, great acting, some great characters and a well directed Akira Kurawasa film. Definitely a movie that all movie fans should give a go.</fullReview>

The acting is top-notch from the whole cast and I really liked how raw and intense the sword fighting sequences between the bandit and the murdered man were. I could feel their desperation and how they were practically being moved only by primal instincts.

		<shortDescription>Kurosawa finally becomes the master.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A stunning breakthrough in Japanese cinema, Akira Kurosawa's "Rashomon" is a film like no other in playing with the expectations of moviegoers from the East to the West. Nearly six decades after the movie's release, it still remains strikingly fresh and original.In 11th-century Japan, four witnesses (Toshiro Mifune, Machiko Kyo, Fumiko Honma &amp; Takashi Shimura) narrate different versions of the story of a man's murder and the rape of his wife. Each story is told so thoroughly flawless that you might ask several questions: Which character is lying? And which character is telling the truth? However, you might need to figure those answers out for yourself.Acknowledging the innovative cinematography from Kazuo Miyagawa, Kurosawa conveys his meticulous attention to detail and stylized compositions into a film that would break cinematic conventions. Nevertheless, "Rashomon" is a groundbreaking achievement in movie-making for many reasons: It is among the first films to utilize non-linear storytelling, to deal with taboo subjects like attempted rape and to be a major Japanese picture released outside of the homeland.From a reviewer's prospective, the actors really gave perfect performances by being naturalistic instead of borderline melodramatic. Mifune delivers bravura enthusiasm in the role of Tajomaru the Bandit with fierce tenacity and wicked magnetism. Of course, I wouldn't forget about the two actors that stood out among the eight principal players: Machiko Kyo and Takashi Shimura. As the suffering female victim, Kyo certainly brings a shred of innocence into her character's fatigued state of mind. And as the amiable woodcutter, Shimura becomes a humane focus for the final story that leaves an open conclusion.Masterful and way ahead of its time, "Rashomon" is just a perfect film in every way possible to spend your 88 minutes. As a deserved reward for his triumph, Kurosawa finally becomes the master.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Non-objective Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Rashomon' is one of Kurosawa's most talked about films. It was considered experimental for its time (perhaps the first of its kind) and even today but the style of execution and storytelling remain unique. The film's influence can be seen in many current day examples but hardly any of them come close to the response that 'Rashomon' draws. How reliable or unreliable is one's memory? 'Rashomon' tells it through a series of sequences...of the 'same' event. Director of photography Kazuo Miyagawa lets the camera play a part of its own. Each recounting of the story is shot from various angles adding new dimensions to the forest which also turns out to be an important character. There's also something distinct about the way the camera moves. Notice the difference in speed during the sequences in the forest. The actors (Toshirô Mifune and Takashi Shimura among others) also deserve credit especially for their non-verbal acting (mainly facial expressions and other body language) as each of them tells their side of the story. The minimal score, sound design and art direction are solidly used.In the end, 'Rashomon' is about truth and that perhaps there is no such thing as an objective truth because everyone has their own interpretation derived from opinions, experience and external factors.</fullReview>

I saw it!') don't only make the woods unsafe, but are one of the most universal topics of humanity.'We humans are weak creatures. That's why we lie, even to ourselves' says it all actually: it's about what people want to hear and when they start being interested at all, apart from wishful thinking. Selfish excuses vs trust in other people. Rashomon gets masterful when in one instant there is literally a different point of view: the camera takes another position to shoot the same sequence, thereby forcing the audience to reconsider what they just saw.This sort of storytelling different testimonies but no truth at the end, is being utilized by many other later films, the most recent one being 'the white ribbon' (though a little different...because it was about different unresolved cases that seems to appear as signs of a greater evil). However as far as I can tell, none achieved the same level of intensity from such a simple tale as did Rashomon. When the 4th tale is being told, thinking viewers may form assumptions on the motives that made the 3 characters in question declared themselves guilty through their own tales.The woodcutter clearly was not the murderer but there is a motive hidden in him; this leads almost immediately to the full awakening of the general theme of Rashomon. The monk was the character that questioned on the theme throughout the movie, and we as the viewers are cleverly placed in that monk's position towards the end. I think many people did not realise that the main theme was already pointed out early in the film. Many reviews mentioned the 4 tales but there was no account on the tale of the person who caught the bandit. Perhaps, the one dialog in the courtroom right after his tale properly concludes the film itself, "obviously, a fool can think only foolish thoughts". It seems that the storytellers fit into that category one way or another.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Akiro Kurosawa's most famous film, Rashomon, tells the story of a murder from four different perspectives. The first is a bandit who claims he fooled a samurai to follow him on a trail to see some valuable swords there. He tied the guy to a tree and brings a woman to the area and seduces her. She is filled with shame asks the bandit to free her husband for a duel. He unties him and they battle to the death.The samurai's wife says that she was raped by the bandit and she begged her husband to forgive her, but he refused and she untied him, fainted and woke up with the knife in her hand and her spouse dead on the ground.The samurai's tale is told through a medium. He says that after his wife was raped, she was asked to travel with the bandit and she agreed and asked her attacker to kill her husband as she did not want to be with two men. The samurai killed himself and a passerby removed the knife.The final version is told by a woodcutter who says that he witnessed the assault. The bandit asked the woman to marry him. The woman asks them to fight for her, and at first they are reluctant. After constant ridicule, they have a duel which results in the death of the samurai. The wife takes off.At a temple, a priest, the woodcutter, and another man hear a baby crying. The child has been abandoned and left in a basket. It concludes with a discussion about the nature of man.Much like Citizen Kane, Rashomon is considered a classic of cinema. I found it interesting, but somewhat cold. I'll watch it again, and maybe it will have a greater impact next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Kurosawa's great works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa's 1950 study of murder and lies is a thundering moral statement. The film builds for us an atmosphere of lies and deceit in our world, showing the cynical mechanics of Kurosawa's old soul. The film plays out four separate stories, each of which are false in someway. Not revealing the true plot to the audience is Kurosawa's metaphor of how we all lie to ourselves and to others and how we barely know the truth in so much deception. Then, at the end, Kurosawa provides a moment of beauty and belief, sharpening our faith in human kind rather than fading it. This moral statement is among the best of all films and remains one of Kurosawa's greatest works of art. It is conceivable that Kurosawa made better films, but this early gem is still hard to beat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>62 years since its making and Rashomon still stays as the best story ever presented on celluloid. Full Stop.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon has totally revamped my cinematic outlook. It is because of this sole reason that I find necessary to write this review . Rashomon is a very simple piece of cinema, a subtle plot handled with great passion and care, alluring the viewer into believing each one of the characters etched out by Kurosawa. Right from the first frame showing the commoner's run in the muddy water in the rain to the exemplary fight sequences of the husband and Mifune to the concluding final shot of the movie, everything shouts of a work of a true genius. No! correction; it is the work of a real and able-story-teller. I saw Seven Samurai before watching this one, and I can assuredly say this now that Kurosawa is a master story-teller. The way he manages the narration of any given story is a gift very few of us can imagine to possess. Movie-maker or not, the art of telling a story stems from the vast canvas of the mind that is thirsty of imagination after imagination, sprinting furthermore with grand images and visuals that are nothing short of an adventure with heaps of euphoria by the end of it. And cinema is the greatest gift for the mind to express its great voyages that take place so often and so beautifully. Kurosawa does exactly that; pick a story from some folklore and create the ambiance that almost perfectly replicates the one in his own mind, sculpt those amazing characters, fill in the scenes with marvelous music and tell the story as it is meant to be, by engaging the viewer quite effortlessly and convincingly. A good film-maker will most certainly know what he wants out of the cinema right from the onset of those colorful reveries in his mind, and etch out exactly that on the reel and on the screen. And by the looks of it, Akira Kurosawa didn't just master that art-form but actually enjoyed the magic of cinema. That explains his desire in inventiveness when it comes to technicalities as a director.Now, The interweaving music plays a huge role in an narration and that justly separates great stories from the insipid ones. Here, I must definitely speak of Rashomon's music, in one word; breathtaking! The right kind of music at a proper appropriate timing in a movie definitely enhances the experience. And the music in Rashomon is a pillar on its own, carrying the great weight of the narration with such ease and beauty. Leaves the viewer with nothing short of enchantment!The center theme of the movie from the ethical point of view is very philosophical and emotive. The seriousness of the underlying tale is innocent without being pretentious, does not cry for attention by relying on simplicity and magnificently binds the strong, powerful characters ; a trend sadly missing in today's pieces of cinema. The ambiguity leaves the viewer to form his own interpretations of the story with the desired conclusions. The quest to know the truth very quickly establishes in the viewer as the story carries forward chapter after chapter with the setting of the three men taking shield from a rainstorm, recounting variant narrations of a single incident and trying so hard to comprehend the happenings echoes with that of the viewer himself. And all three men here do find a reliable standpoint towards the end. The solemn want of the woodcutter and the priest to believe and reason with what they witnessed makes the viewer almost feel like the commoner in the movie and sure does demand to subject oneself with a moral-questioning of the self . These are the after-affects, bound to spring in after watching any movie, and they are free to roam about in any direction you wish for. But what spellbound me the most is the way Rashomon created that path towards those after-affects. I leave with a sense of appreciation and awe, and a superior form of admiration and with a greatly enhanced respect towards the makers of movies; a feeling I encounter so rarely when it comes to the mystic world of cinema. Rashomon is that quintessential classic. Enigmatic, charming, gripping and thought-provoking in a true sense. And I bow down to such creations with my humble devotion and a polished passion that act as the magic elixir for the cineaste in me. ~ Long Live Good Cinema ~</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambiguous Perspectives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Rashomon is a relatively simple story about the recollections of four individuals who testify to a rape of a woman and a samurai's murder. There's the bandit (Tishorio Mifune), the samurai (Masayuki Mori), the samurai' wife (Machiko Kyo), and the woodcutter (Takashi Shimura). Each of their own perspective is told through flashback, and leads the viewer down a path of wonder and keen interest. When the film draws to a close, the plot does not resolved itself. We do not know who is telling the truth. Nor do we know the fate of the accused bandit and the helpless widow. It is entirely up to the viewer to decide which character is telling the truth (if they even are). That's the beauty of this film. I have my own theory of what happened, but another viewer may not agree with me. That's the lesson director Akira Kurosawa successfully makes with this film. Every person has his or her own perspective. As a result, each individual will see something different within this movie. Unlike some of Kurosawa's later work like The Seven Samurai or The Hidden Fortress, Rashomon is not a fast-paced movie. Much of the slow pace has to deal with Kurosawa's famous use of the long take. There are many shots in which the camera lingers on one character as he or she delivers some form of action. One scene that comes to mind is when the bandit is shown killing the samurai. As he slowly creeps towards his victim, the camera tracks him until he makes his final deathblow. Some may argue that the long take, especially in this scene, draws out the action much longer than necessary. In my opinion, it works very well. The purpose of this use of the long take is to emphasis the tension and intensity that the bandit experiences right before he murders the samurai. His gritted teeth and bulged eyes show that he is not very accustomed to murder, despite his profession as a thief. The acting is pretty thorough when it comes to Tishorio Mifune and Masayuki Mori. Mifune is an icon for exaggerated emotion. His over the top, devilish laugh, and his intense facial expressions work perfect for him as the merciless bandit. Masayuki Mori is subtler as the samurai. He does not have many lines, but much of his accomplishment derives from his facial expressions. This is particularly noteworthy when he watches as his wife is violated before his eyes. There is such an anger and passion in his face during this scene that it borders on frightening. I was not impressed with Machiko Kyo as the samurai's wife. This is very apparent when she taunts both the bandit and the samurai as being weak. Her constant screeches and ridiculous laughter in this scene was enough to make me feel nauseated. Takashi Shimura as the woodcutter did not do much for me either. He merely told his side of the story and adopted an abandoned infant at the end of the film.A bigger problem I had with this movie is the fight scenes. I understand that this film was made sixty years ago, but more money needed to be spent on the choreography. It is lame to watch as both a bandit and a samurai constantly fall over during a duel as well as throw leaves at one another as a means of fighting. In my concluding opinion, Rashomon is a decent movie. It is not for the average audience, for there is little action and even less humor. This is movie is not meant to be popcorn-loving entertainment. It is meant to make the audience think about the plot's ambiguity and decide for themselves what is true and false.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The quintessential "challenging" foreign film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suspect Kurosawa's masterwork is tough sledding for native Japanese speakers so Americans working off sub-titles probably are advised to have a discussion group available post screening. "Rash&#x32d;omon" uses the conflicting unreliable narrator technique from Faulkner's "The Sound and the Fury" (a title borrowed from Shakespeare's "Macbeth") in presenting the same story of a murder in 12th century Japan told from multiple perspectives. Like real life these presenters, one of whom is dead and working through a potentially unreliable medium, twist and bend the tale in order to avoid prison and/or dishonor or just for their own self-aggrandizement. Who killed the husband? How much of a willing party was the wife in her deflowering by the bandit? What motives drive the parties involved including our 3 narrators the woodcutter, priest and commoner? When Kurosawa lingers on the sword is that a clue? If you liked (and you should have) "The Usual Suspects" and are up for a serious cinematic test see Rashomon and try to unravel it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As you might have guessed by my screen name, I am a fan of the Japanese culture and have always liked Akira Kurosawa films. I was eager to watch Rashomon and was not disappointed. This is a marvelous movie. I had to watch this movie a second time to really observe some of the wonderful elements in the film. The first viewing I let the story take me away and paid no attention to any of the finer elements. I truly love so many aspects of this film, from the cinematography to the acting. The story captures many facets, I really don't have enough time to truly dedicate to fully explore all of them. If you have never experienced a Kurosawa film this is a good one to start on. I would suggest Seven Samurai next, but that will have to wait till a different review.For more on this review please go to http://fatsamuraireviews.blogspot.com/2011/05/rashomon.html</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece was mesmerizing. I am really turned on by the mise en scene. Any cinema major or filmmaker should watch this movie over and over again to get a better understanding of visual language of cinema. ""Truth has many faces should be the tagline of the movie. There are like 5 characters talking about a murder that they have witnessed in the movie. All of the characters tell a different story, and I absolutely have no idea whose story is the right one. May be it is like 5 blind men holding an elephants part, all of the stories tell a part of the true story. And I do believe that the movie ends pessimistic. The woodcutter smiles devilishly when he carries the baby. He might sell the baby to slavery, or may be cook and eat it.Although it is not possible to understand what's the truth, it is possible to understand a truth about human nature. We shape the truth by our needs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Rashomon" was my first Akira Kurosawa movie to watch, and what a great time I had watching it, This movie is not the kind of movie that you watch, people start talking about it for a period of time and then it's all forgotten like most of movies today, no ...to me "Rashomon" is one of those immortal movies that will always Float on the ocean of motion pictures.In this movie Akira succeeded on both the Artistry side and Message behind it, Great techniques to capture the movie by the legendary cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa, a Splendid acting by a few number of casts, the lighting and angles, great adapted and edited screenplay from Ryunosuke Akutagawa .. everything was masterful.Talking about the great message behind this movie, when anyone watch "Rahomon" for the first time, the only question comes to the mind is " Who is telling the truth ?" going far away from Akira's true purpose of telling the story....that there is no such a thing as a complete true story, that every man tells his own VERSION of the story to satisfy his/her own needs, that every man has some portion of selfishness inside him and greed digging in heart of the mind, and that there is no such a thing as "An absolute truth" no matter what though we have to consider a scale for the truthfulness being told, it's all about considering that there are different perspectives for almost everything, A great way to end the movie was to point out that even the bad side is part of us there is also the good and shining side, that we can do both good and bad, we are not angels nor demons.... We are just humans.An Immortal Masterful for an Immortal director that shall never die.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done mystery morality tale...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 11/21/2009 - 7 out of 10 (Dir-Akira Kurasawa): Well done mystery morality tale by acclaimed Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. The story is told in flashbacks and is about an encounter between a bandit, a samurai and his wife in the woods. The samurai is found dead but how did he die and who killed him? The story is told initially by the man who found the body supposedly during a rainy day where there is not much else to do. The story ends up being told from many other perspectives and each telling is different. There is an evil aspect in every telling which causes one of the listeners to lose total confidence in man and his negative possibilities. This is a very deep and emotional film that mostly involves male characters, which is very unique in films of any kind. The lone female character is deceptive, evil and not to believed. Of all the stores told, we really don't know what truths are within each of them -- only that a man is dead. This is the beauty of this film made by Kurasawa as he plays with our thoughts to the very end. When it's over we're still thinking and this, in my opinion, is the mark of a good film. We really go away not caring who did it, but we learn a lot about human nature and it's inadequacies and what really matters most to us. This is a classic movie by this brilliant Japanese icon of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful metaphor of "The Passion"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Japanese cinema dealt with some huge philosophical questions during the early 1950s. Ikiru with the significance of a man's life, Seven Samurai with an elaborate twist on class distinction and Godzilla with fears of nuclear devastation. This was inevitable after such human and environmental tragedy that was experienced in Hiroshima, and more importantly Nagasaki. Rashomon itself, is a beautiful metaphor of Christ's Passion. The same story told in four different ways, ending with same conclusion i.e. the death of an innocent man. Like the Passion, the audience cannot say for sure if one is correct, elements of all four stories are correct or the whole story is false. Kurosawa earns his crew's jocular nickname "wind man" in this film as the movie is played out in incessant rain and howling wind, apart from rather ironically, in the outdoor courtroom, possibly so as not to deflect from the witnesses statements. The heavyweights of Japanese acting appear here, Shimura, Mifune and Chiaki are all excellent as is Kichijiro Ueda (who I'd never seen previously) as the refreshingly honest and intellectual bandit. Kurosawa's films at times use dialogue only as means to move forward the plot and this can make them seem stilted and even clichéd, I have always found this was meant as a time saving device rather than an under-cooking of the story, particularly as Kurosawa finds some wonderful imagery both visually and via the plot. Summing up, there will never be another director who is able to ask such poignant questions of man so elegantly as Kurosawa and this film delivers for me his understanding of such an important period of our written history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Regarded as Kurosawa's masterpiece, this is a visually opulent film about a rape and a murder told from multiple viewpoints. While Kurosawa displays his cinematic genius with the camera, the acting is more suited to the theater, with exaggerated gestures and emotional displays. Mifune is a compelling presence, but he, like most of the cast, overacts wildly at times. The story is interesting but becomes too melodramatic and the plot element concerning the baby seems to be tacked on as an afterthought. The score seems to be based on Ravel's "Bolero." A very open-ended film, leaving much to interpretation, which is fine, but it could have benefited from some subtlety.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rashomon. When the movie first opens in which seems to be a rundown house, it has a very slow storyline, but after the first 20 minutes, I was drawn into the story and found myself thinking ahead trying to figure out the mystery that was going on. The movie seems to take place in the past, but I can only assume this because the people were using samurai swards and getting around by foot and horses. The acting in Rashomon was different, but not necessarily bad. You must remember to watch this movie with an open mind, and realize that it is completely different than American movies during this same time period. The editing and framing was pretty much what one would expect from an older movie, and did not affect the film in any negative way. Like I mentioned earlier, the plot seemed to develop kind of slowly, but picks up about half way through the film when you started to get different stories on the murder and tragedy that has happened. For being a movie from the fifties, I was quite surprised with the details of the characters conflict.To my pleasant surprise, I really enjoyed Rashomon. This story has many valuable lessons to life in it that can still be used today. It addresses the cruel nature of man and the way we are deceitful to fulfill our greed. I only had a few problems with the movie. First was the slow pace that it moved in. Although interesting, when the last man who actually witnessed the murder tells his story, I was still trying to figure out what the real point of the movie or message of the movie was. Eventually I figured it out, but after a couple "this has to be over soon" quotes. Next I found the wife of the murdered man to be extremely annoying. She cries in 3/4th of the scenes she is in. And finally there was a random baby at the end of the movie to prove that there was still good in some men. I think that this could have been accomplished in another way. The baby just appeared and it was kind of awkward. Overall, Rashomon was a good film, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys older movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mystery/Drama: Who did it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Akira Kurosawa of Rashomon, turned the short stories of "Rashomon" and "In a Grove" originally done by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, into a great, first of its kind, movie. What initially was a story about the failing morality of man; Kurosawa made a mystery/drama comparable to any modern movie or TV show making want to know who committed the crime. Given the differences in filming in Japan from Hollywood, this was an entertaining film while being educational.Kurosawa gets your attention from the very beginning. From the monsoon rain, to the dilapidated gate, it all sets the mood for the film. Unfortunately, Kurosawa stresses the picturing of nature so much that it drags the movie out so much in some places; it takes the focus away from what is happening at that moment. Despite of these lengthy scenes, the movie still manages to remain entertaining through the story and the characters. The most entertaining character is by far the thief. From his creepy laugh and the most unexpected times and his poor sword skills keep the viewer intrigued as to how the movie will finish as well as keeping a small amount of humor. Akira Kurosawa did an excellent job of portraying each characters story by easily distinguishing the differences. These scenes make it really easy to end the movie the portrayal of good and bad in all men and most of all wondering who did it.Overall the movie was very enjoyable even with the lengthy scenes of nature. Kurosawa's ability to keep the audience entertained with fairly short tale is outstanding. The movie follows more of the story "In a Grove" rather than "Rashomon" and it would have been interesting if Kurosawa could have finished movie more like the short story. This mystery/drama is sure to keep you interested if you are interested in classic Japanese culture or just looking for a classic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest films ever made, in any language</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest films I've ever seen, in any language, I might add. A haunting, unforgettable classic from the directorial genius, Akira Kurosawa. Its truly unlike any movie you've ever seen before. It examines and questions the very essence of truth. Its incredible that it was made in 1950, even today, its still a staggering and enduring influence on cinema throughout the world.'Rashomon' is truly an unconventional and existential film with a non-linear narrative. It is such a profound film that even if you see it numerous times, you'll still be picking out things you didn't notice previously. Its punctuated with poetic metaphors and symbolisms throughout. Now I know where great American directors like Robert Altman, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, etc, all get their inspiration from. I love Kurosawa's expressionistic approach to film-making. His use of camera angles, lighting, etc, is a treat to behold.This film basically tells the story of a priest, a woodcutter, a thief and an ordinary man who all take turns narrating, through flashbacks, the same series of events while waiting out a heavy rainstorm. They all discuss the brutal murder of a Samurai and the rape of his wife they claim they witnessed in the jungle. You, the viewer, like the characters in the film, are never sure what is real and what isn't. It is never explained, you're forced to draw your own conclusions. What you hear is four completely different stories of the crimes committed in the woods. Every storyteller is untrustworthy, especially the woodcutter's, who was the first to see evidence of the crimes.This film has a very powerful and spiritual ending where the woodcutter get a shot a redemption. I can see why this film is still very influential and important since its release 54 years ago. An unqualified masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Such stories are commonplace now"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of our best directors can be credited with inspiring a style of filming making or contributing some new technique, but only a handful are responsible for adding a word to cinematic language. However a "Rashomon" plot structure has today become a term for any storyline in which events are told from multiple points of view. This pioneering film will be long remembered as a landmark achievement.This was the film that first brought Kurosawa ? and Japanese film as a whole ? to worldwide attention. Ironically however it is not quite a typical Kurosawa picture. The minimalism of locations and characters makes it something like a stage play ? a far cry from his massive historical epics and social dramas. Also while his films dealt with a variety of social issues, this was usually on a down-to-earth, personal level. It was rare that he would deal with something as abstract as the nature of truth. Having said that, Kurosawa was himself dismissive of any highbrow interpretations ? underneath the unusual plot structure and philosophical musings it is a simple story about human relations, in this case why we are compelled to lie.This is also often referred to as the first truly great Kurosawa film ? the one where he really worked out his style. I would argue though that he wasn't quite there yet. In particular some of the action sequences seem a little too long drawn out. They aren't as tightly directed as those in his later period films such as Seven Samurai and Hidden Fortress.One area in which Kurosawa clearly was fully matured was in his use of location. The picture only has three main settings, all highly contrasted: the dappled shade of the forest where the "hidden" crime took place; the ruined gatehouse symbolising the feelings of the people huddled inside it to escape the rain; and the plain, formal courthouse. Kurosawa's trademark use of weather is also fully developed in Rashomon. This is most obvious in the heavy rainfall at the Rashomon gate, but there is also clever use of cloudy skies in other scenes ? particularly in the incredible shot of the bandit riding along silhouetted against the horizon.The acting is highly melodramatic, particularly in the flashbacks, and more so than is usual for Kurosawa films. For the most part this is the perfect style ? in particular with Toshiro Mifune as the bandit who snarls and lunges like a wild animal. There is also a mesmerising performance by Fumiko Homma as a possessed medium. Other times the over-the-top acting doesn't quite work. For example I'm not personally convinced by Machiko Kyo as the wife.The music is a bit disappointing for Fumio Hayakawa (who did great scores on Ikiru and Seven Samurai). But then in this case a grand score would most likely detract from the visual elements of the film rather than enhance them.Of all Kurosawa's films, this is the one I recommend as a starter for people new to his work. Despite Japanese audiences apparently being confused by it on initial release, the story is actually quite simple and it can be easily taken in in a single viewing. And while very different to his usual output, it does at least feature the sentimental humanism, reversing of traditional roles and of course the stylised swordplay that are Kurosawa hallmarks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it might seem like an odd starting point, the first time I heard of Kurosawa's Rashomon was when I read Iris Chang's Rape of Nanking for the first time a few years ago. Within this book she alluded to the film because of the various stories detailing the atrocities committed in Nanking differed greatly depending on the source of information. Anyway, a couple of years after that I read Akutagawa Ryuunosuke's short story "Rashomon" and noticed that it really did not fit Chang's brief description of the movie and it was not until I read a later short story in the collection, "In the Grove", did I find the actual short story the film was based on.The film Rashomon was Western film audiences' first real exposure to the films of Kurosawa Akira and it ignited the flame of interest in Kurosawa's films for decades to come. And with good reason, because Rashomon is truly an excellent film and it still tops best films ever made lists constantly.During a terrible rainfall three men, a priest, a woodcutter, and a bandit, duck into the ruins of the Rashomon gate to escape the massive downpour. The priest and the woodcutter have just returned from a court case detailing the murder of a samurai by the bandit Tajomaru. Listening to Tajomaru's testimony it seems like a pretty cut and dry case. He wanted the samurai's wife for his own and after raping her he killed her husband as she asked him to do. However, after listening to the wife's story and even the dead husband's story through a medium, it is hard to say what the truth?is The old saying goes "History is written by the victors" and Rashomon definitely displays not only how different people view the same events, but how lies thread their way into the truth and corrupt it. Kurosawa depicts the scene with the samurai, his wife, and the bandit Tajomaru four times within the film's 88 minutes, and the resulting juxtaposition is quite enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie grows on one. We get to see the same horrible crime in which a highwayman kills the man and ravages his wife -- from the bandit himself, from the woman, and from the victim from beyond the grave (which is extremely clever. But of course this is Kurosawa, so what else can one expect?) All three stories are equally plausible, as one might expect from the three different viewpoints.The highwayman (to be sure a sociopath, as shown in a deliberately hideous laugh that underscores the ugliness of his character), doomed already, for once has the freedom to tell his owns story because what he says will no longer change his destiny The wife has her story, part of which is that she got a little choice -- in view of the lack of choice typical for women in medieval Japan, and in that momentary choice she can even talk the highwayman into settling down to a normal life and giving up crime. The dead man, the husband, has no cause to say anything but what he experienced -- of course in an unearthly way.This was clearly a risky story (actually a trilogy within a framework) to set to film -- and Kurosawa leaves no doubt that he and only he could have done this. The imagery is, of course, spectacular; Kurosawa shows genius there too.A definite 10 due to its uniqueness and its excellence in every detail. This is an absolute must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A narrative masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rashômon is the film that introduced Japanese cinema to America, and got the now legendary director his fame. One of the things that comes to mind the fastest about 'Rashômon' is its structure. The essential story of the film is the re- telling of a crime: a murder(?) and a rape. The incident involves an infamous bandit named Tajômaru (Toshirô Mifune), a samurai called Takehiro (Masayuki Mori) and his wife, Masako (Machiko Kyô). The trial is told by a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) and a priest (Minoru Chiaki) to a skeptical and cynical commoner (Kichijiro Ueda). The three men are seeking shelter under a gate during heavy rainfall when the film opens, and through out most of the film the rain is there. As the film progressives and different stories are told, the viewer notices something different about each story. Perhaps its what happened to whom, or what happened to what exactly, but these changes mark an interesting note about human nature. This same method, albeit used less psychologically, was always featured in Stanley Kubrick's 'The Killing' and Quentin Tarantino's 'Jackie Brown'. The narrative definitely works, and if anything its what defines the film. Kurosawa effortlessly weaves a magnificent tale of treachery and deceit as well as kindness in the end in an elaborate tale about humans and the way they act. The performances, especially by Mifune and Kyô are definitely superb. Mifune (who also plays a great character in two other Kurosawa films: 'Yojimbo' and 'The Seven Samurai') is filled with kinetic energy and definitely chews his scenes up. Kyô gives a more feminine performance naturally, and adds to it some more emotions of a woman emotionally weak yet at the same time quite cunning. The direction by Kurosawa is sweeping as the story progresses on and on, and observe how the characters are practically talking to the audience during the trial scenes. The script, based on two stories by Ryunosuke Akutagawa is also brilliant, filled with not only memorable dialogue, but cutting edge dialogue from its time. To say the film is paced slowly is correct, yet at the same time it manages to hold the viewer's interest. Also deserving mention is the gorgeous cinematography by Kazuo Miyagawa, the scenes in the forest look absolutely stunning. All being said, 'Rashômon' is more than deserving of its status in film history, and should also be remembered as a great masterpiece. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Rashomon" put Akira Kurosawa on the map here in America back in 1951 and thank God! The film is mostly a morality drama, placed in a land of myth and legend, several hundred years ago in Japan. Along with "Rear Window" by Hitchcock, this film delves into human nature and the filmic viewing experience in one fell swoop. This one takes on perspective and what it can say about the individual giving it and the listener recieving it. No review could do justice to this great work of art, so do yourself a favor and watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some aspects of Rashomon that struck me as a little weird the first time through, but by the end of the movie made more sense.Mifune's explosive acting in the first third struck me as overdone, but as the movie went on I realized that whatever happened in the woods unhinged him as much as Masako or the woodcutter. It's just part of his story, the exaggerated bravado in the face of shock.The orphan and the musings of the priest initially seem to be an example of Kurosawa's tendency towards sentimentality, but do serve to balance the structure of the film. The priest is a counterpoint to the amoral prodding's of the commoner. Taking on the abandoned baby stands opposite of the events portrayed in the film (adults dominating and possessing each other). The piano bits in the score seem a bit odd, but that sort of piano piece hadn't come to be regarded as quaint in 1950.Another thing that took a few minutes to get used to was the degree to which Rashomon is a silent film. Five or ten minutes at a time pass without dialogue. Much of the film is conveyed through stylized facial expression, almost Fincher-like quick cut action or painterly compositions. It must have seemed awfully old fashioned at the time to produce something that comes so close to pantomime and iconographic painting.One of my favorite things about film is the way movies flesh out relatively simple ideas and stories. Like the way The Godfather dresses up a pulp crime novel and makes it a national myth. Kane, Seven Samurai, Grand Illusion, and Rashomon are all stories so simple they can be summed up in a few sentences. The philosophical heart of Rashomon is a variant on the question about a tree falling in the woods, answering that whatever people thought happened, in effect, happened. All three characters claim to have killed Takehiro (including Takehiro himself) and claim to have done so because of the values they live by. They must have killed him, because not to would imply that they are not the person they thought they were. None of them lies to shift the blame of the death off themselves, quite the opposite. The event itself is lost, even with multiple witnesses, because there is no such thing as a disinterested party.One of the things about this movie that stays with me is the four characters that were participants and observers are so finely balanced. It's like a spider web and each retelling is like pushing at one end of it, dragging and deforming the whole thing in that direction. The woodcutter is clearly the most easily swayed of the bunch. So Kurosawa has him offer up his story only after he has watched the three other stories told, obviously confusing his take on the thing. (The upshot of his story seems to be that they were a bunch of awful people and that no one should miss the knife he picked up when the coast was clear.) At the other end is the bandit's tale, a tale of passion and cleverly subverted nobility. It creates an aura of menace to Mifune's bandit that is slowly eaten away during the film until the woodcutter's story when the bandit and samurai are finally shown squalidly fumbling around in the dirt. And so on...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Nature of Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man can not tell the truth. The truth exists only for an instant, after that it is only a memory, a memory filtered through human perception. Does this make man evil? No, it only makes him human... "Rashomon" deals with such themes. Akira Kurasawa's thought-provoking, meditative, and inovative film asks philosophical questions about the nature of truth, by showing one act of as seen through the eyes of four different people. The results are varied, and obscure the truth. But this is far more complex than one would imagine, for the characters do not, as it is often said, tell the story to make themselves seem the more . In fact, 3/4 claim to have commited the themselves. This results in a profound, but delightful psychological and philosophical puzzle of a film. The visual aesthetics of Kurasawa's film are beautiful, and most innovative considering the very low budget. As a whole the film has a soft, meditative, and very Japanese feel. Scenes of the sun playing through the trees, dappling the ground in dancing shadows, come to mind as being most effective. But what is most impressive, is that the pacing can be so lively, and entertaining, despite the fact that the majority of the film is made up of variations of the same scene. Kurasawa's pallete of truth and humanity introduced western ure to Japanese cinema, and is still a fine introduction to the film of that ure. All in all, "Rashomon" is most interesting, and satisfying fare. World cinema at its finest!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Japanese films's ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is truly a magnificent film, one of the best ever made in Japan. Akira Kurosawa is truly an incredible film maker. He uses the common human difference of how they see and experience things to make a wonderful film. Part mystery, drama, and horror film. The plot is about a man, who is strolling along one day with his wife when he is attacked and tied up by Tajomaru, a bandit. Tajomaru's wife is then raped. However, no one really knows what happened after that or how the man was killed. It is told from four different perspectives. One from the bandit, One from the wife, one from the dead husband who is contacted using a medium (in a very creepy scene) and finally by a woodcutter who saw the whole thing. Each story is different in it's own way. This film has very excellent B&amp;W film noir photography. It is ingenously scripted, plotted, and shot. Akira Kurosawa is most certainly up to filmmakers suck as Eisenstien, Hitchcock, and Orson Welles. The shots out woodcutter strolling through the woods are especially gorgeous. Japan's unique film industry got right back up on it's feet after the war ended and they were allowed to make controversial films again. This is my favorite Kurosawa film. I especially like it's ghostly, horror elements. The title Rashomon actually refers to the gate Rajomon, where these tales are told. My rating: ***** out of *****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw Rashomon when I was 8 or 9, with no prior knowledge of it, and didn't even know I'd seen a classic until someone told me so 10 years later.Nevertheless, it stuck with me -- even without knowing the title, I thought about it and described it to other people often over the ensuing years. As another reviewer pointed out, Rashomon is decidedly _not_ about differences in perception, but rather about self-deceit. Each of the three "false" versions serves the purposes of its teller -- the last, "honest" version serves nothing but the truth. Like most Kurosawa pictures (Ran and Ikiru make especially good examples), it doesn't have a specific moral. He lays out the questions in detail, and lets the viewer chew on them. And it doesn't hurt that he does so with such visual brilliance....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't really say anything about this wonderful film that hasn't already been said. What I do want to comment on is the brilliance in construction of this film and most others by Akira Kurosawa. His movies can be watched foremostly on a purely entertaining level due mostly to the well-formulated characters, brilliantly portrayed by some of Kurosawa's stock actors and the man of a thousand expressions Toshiro Mifune, and also the gripping action scenes perfectly choreographed. Second, there's more to them just in the plots than what's written to entertain. I can't think of one of his films that has a straight and simple plot that's at all predictable. Finally, and most importantly, the proof a true cinematic genius, there's always underlying meanings and subtexts, things that could be easily ignored but would be blasphemous to do so.The other thing I have to say about this film is that in many ways it's a horror film. Baring great resemblance to the style and makeup of many Hitchcock films. It deals with rape, infidelity, back-stabbing husbands and wives, channeling of ghosts, and the most horrible of all, human greed. And the scene in the beginning where Shimura's walking through the forest is extremely suspenseful, evident by how it's filmed and a lot like the plethora of forest scenes in horror films throughout the 70s and 80s. And that "medium" scene where the husband is channeled is genuinely creepy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>modern directors should study this classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rashomon is clearly one of Kirosawa's best films, although most would probably claim Ran is top of the list. The basic story is about conflicting testimonials of a particular event, but truely deals not with the audience trying to determine who is telling the truth per se, but rather how everyone "remembers" events to their own advantage.The even in question concerns a woman who has been attacked by a roaming bandit, and how she, her husband, and the bandit react in the aftermath. If the film were to be remade today, it would probably star Gretta Scacchi or someother busty beauty, the rape would be graphically displayed as the bandit rips off her clothes, paws at her tits, and humps her on-screen. The rape in Rashomon was never actually shown, but inferred, and was very obvious. The terror and violation of the woman had to be imagined by the audience making it far more involving than simply passively watching it on-screen. Film directors should take note as to how to properly engage an audience.The acting may not transcend as well to modern audiences, though. Those who regularly view older (foreign) films will recognize and accept the acting style, but others may well find it over the top.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RASHOMON is the film that got me hooked onto Kurosawa, and you simply would have no idea what amazingly transformative powers films can have until you've seen what Kurosan does with RASHOMON. Everything in the film speaks of the director and his crews' brilliance at their peak, right down to the didactic conclusion that leaves you rather warm and fuzzy inside.[If the ending seems unbelievably abrupt and a cop-out, perhaps it's time to view it as a Kurosawan tendency and plea - at least in his younger years of the 50's - that "Willpower can indeed cure all human ailings." Indeed, it is this willpower to transform the self and social, to presevere in such humanistic ideals that characterize what is widely considered Kurosawa's peak period (50s-60s.)]The sin of EGOISM of the INDIVIDUAL at the cost of SELF and SOCIAL, that is what RASHOMON aims at and achieves masterfully -in a style that emulates the subtle beauty of silent films: the dance of light and shadow in a naturalistic (forest) setting.And yes, the acting cannot be any better (100%+++ for Shimura, Mifune, Mori, Kyo, Ueda.... everybody!!!) If I've made this film sound like serious and heavy-handed stuff, that's because it IS! Equally important is RASHOMON's ability to ENTERTAIN. The film's desire to be visually pleasing as well as intellectually challenging make this a simply unique artwork of AK's genius. Rest in peace, Kurosan.</fullReview>

Then from my standpoint, I prefer to insist the writer's name; Akutagawa Ryuunosuke, the novelist who has been well-known as a distinguished creator of Japanese tales for 100 years. His works are still outstanding and amazing! About the story, unconsciously I was being absorbed in the three witnesses' recollected scenes which are beautifully idealized by their ego. They are described well enough to show Japanese-like individualities. One of the samurai is so impudent and esteems a strength as a soldier. Another samurai is much more loyal person who tends to respect the beauty of transilent life. A woman thinks much of obedience to men and modest temper. The other extras, that consequently organize the story, are also true as obvious Japanese feature, for example a priest. The description of each character doesn't complete this film as just a mysterious ,silent, or gloomy story as a usual image toward Japanese film. It is rather an extremely funny and well-arranged fairy tale.</fullReview>

A known bandit has been caught and blamed for the crime, he recognizes he did it but, in the flashbacks we see, he differs in the details from the wife of the samurai and from a medium channeling the deceased. One of the persons in the temple, claiming to have been a witness of the deed, tells a fourth version of the story. Who is telling the truth? If there is indeed something we can call the truth.This Akira Kurosawa movie from 1950 was a breakthrough film not just for the great master but for Japanese cinema abroad. Before Rashomon, almost no Japanese movies had been shown outside Japan. It is a great film, that 65 years after it was made, has stood the test of time.It is a very stylized movie, full of non naturalistic, over the top performances (seemingly influenced by the Japanese theatrical traditions of Kabuki and Noh), especially by Toshiro Mifune as the bandit, and the beautiful Machiko Kyo's as the Samurai's wife.

		<fullReview>This Japanese film I had the poster of many times, and I heard it was possibly the most talked about film from director Akira Kurosawa (Ikiru, Seven Samurai, Ran), and obviously it featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, so I had to see it. Basically at the former gatehouse called Rashômon a heavy rainfall is happening, and taking refuge from it are a Priest (Minoru Chiaki), a Woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) and a Commoner (Kichijirô Ueda), the priest and the woodcutter recall the story of a samurai murdered in a forest grove, the woodcutter discovered the body three days earlier. The film flashes back to the murder trial, when the priest and woodcutter were summoned to testify, the priest ran into the samurai Takehiro Kanazawa (Masayuki Mori) and his wife Masako (Machiko Kyô) the same day before the murder occurred going through the forest, three other people who are supposedly the only direct witnesses testified as well, notorious bandit Tajômaru (Toshirô Mifune), the samurai's wife, and the samurai himself testifying through a Medium (Noriko Honma). The three of them tell structured stories about how Tajômaru, who claims he did indeed rape the wife and murder the victim, but these stories contradict each other as well, with the way the motivations and killing happened. At Rashômon the woodcutter reveals that following the trials he actually knows more than he was letting on, this brings his own actions into question, but another discovery and the actions from it bring the woodcutter's own humanity or lack of into focus, a baby was left in a basket near the scene of the crime and the woodcutter stole the murder weapon, the knife, after finding the body, he wanted to care for the child himself, the priest understands his point of view. Also starring Daisuke Katô as Policeman. The direction by Kurosawa is stylised very well, the acting by all the cast members, especially Mifune as the stressed bandit is great, and the editing techniques for flashbacks and plot are for the experimentation with what is true and what we think very clever, all combined makes an atmospheric and intriguing drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, and it won the Honorary Award voted by the Board of Governors as the most outstanding foreign language film released in the United States during 1951, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source.

There were three people involved in the murder a husband and wife, and a bandit known as Tajomaru. The husband is murdered by Tajomaru, that is not what is so strange about the murder, what is strange is at the trial all of the people's stories differ. The testimonies of the bandit Tajomaru, the wife, and even the dead husband through a medium are heard and all of them are quite different. The men taking shelter try to sort out what is the truth and truly find out about what happened during the murder.The direction of this film was absolutely stunning and proves why Akira Kurosawa is a legendary director. There were plenty of beautiful shots of the landscape, and also the rain at the shelter where the three men were staying. The way he chose to film the trial was also magnificent especially when the dead husband was talking through the medium. The close ups on Toshiro Mifune were as well stunning and overall just a brilliantly directed film.The acting in this film was not so great, a bit over the top in my opinion. There was much cackling and overly strong showings of emotion. The only acting in here that could be considered somewhat good would be Toshiro Mifune's as Tajomaru. He was over the top, but his character was as well. He does not act as well as he does in later films such as Seven Samurai or Yojimbo but still does a fine job. The men in the shelter acted well also, but the acting needed for their roles was not very demanding.Overall this was a solid 7/10, it was slow at points but had a strong finish. This is not Kurosawa's greatest film but it is definitely worth seeing. I would definitely recommend this to fans of Akira Kurosawa, the samurai genre, and the mystery genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, but end bombs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa had been a filmmaker for almost a decade, since his 1943 debut film Sugata Sanshiro, and had some renown in his native Japan, when, in 1950, his film Rashomon rocketed him to international acclaim, including the Academy Award For Best Foreign Film, after winning the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival brought the film and its director, and Japanese cinema, a Western audience. He deserved every plaudit he received for it, as well as every ticket sold, because it is an excellent film. Yes, there are some flaws- minor, such as the all too sunny (literally) ending, and some of the over the top hammy acting of Toshiro Mifune as the bandit Tajomaru, but given what was coming out of Hollywood at the time- mind-numbing musicals and grade B comedies- Kurosawa brought film-making style back to an earlier, simpler place, even as he many times over increased the bar for narrative complexity. Given that the film is not even an hour and a half long, the many interpretations of the multifarious actions of the characters are all the more impressive.The story is as familiar as it is simple. The central ostensible narrative concerns the rape of a woman (Machiko Kyo) and the murder of her Samurai husband (Masayuki Mori), both unnamed, in the 11th or 12th Century, in a wooded glen. The main suspect is the notorious bandit Tajomaru (Mifune), yet, the viewer cannot be certain, for never do we get a single unbiased version of the events that transpire. All three of the main characters tell self-serving versions of the story of how the lady was raped and the Samurai murdered?.The film does stretch real reality, a bit, in that while it is well known that minor differences crop up in people's versions of singular events, such glaring inconsistencies as whether or not the Samurai died of a knife or sword wound are implausible, even given the film's setting. But, we allow for this dramatic license because the resonance of the tale's moral is so profound, as well the fact that Kurosawa does not cop out by giving us a 'real' authoritative version. That said, the end of the film, after the differing tales of the crime have been discussed thoroughly by the woodcutter, priest, and commoner, Kurosawa seems to stumble, as if he did not have a really good way to end the film. The commoner hears a baby, who's been abandoned at the temple. He steals its blanket, and the priest and woodcutter try to stop him, claiming him evil. He responds by implying that the abandoning parents were evil, and that the woodcutter is a liar, and possible killer. Off into the rain he goes, with his booty. The priest and woodcutter stand with the child until the rain breaks and the sun emerges. The woodcutter offers to take the babe as his own, that he has six children already, and another mouth will hardly matter. The priest feels that his optimism about life and mankind, so tested by the events he has seen, is reaffirmed by the woodcutter's generous offer, and the sun shines through the clouds. That such a terrifically subtle and ambiguous film ends so tritely (the emergent sun and abandoned and rescued baby are a simply awful and heavy-handed use of symbolism), and preachily, reminded me of the greatly disappointing ending that Fyodor Dostoevsky tacked on to Crime And Punishment, in his two terrible epilogues that hammer the book's themes into a reader's head, for he distrusted his own book's ability to convey those themes. The visual and musical aspects of the film's ends do much to mitigate the narrative drop to the floor Crime And Punishment bears, and Rashomon is still a great film, partly because its ending is not as bad as Crime And Punishment's, and partly because it reaches greater artistic heights, and dares more conventions, than Dostoevsky's novel. Still, there's no excuse for its veer from even greater heights, even if the last few minutes are not the heart of the film. While all the actors are wonderful, too much attention has been given to Toshiro Mifune's loony overacting (sometimes a necessity for the comic and divergent elements to emerge) as the bandit. Yes, this film made him a star, but the best performance in the film is by Masayuki Mori, already a major film and stage star in Japan. His is a far less showy role than Mifune's, but he conveys the slight differences all the versions the others tell with none of the easy visual pyrotechnics Mifune's almost boobish bandit is allowed. The raising of an eyebrow can mean the difference between truth and lie, and Mori is expert at walking the line between those ends. Machiko Kyo, as the wife, is the least notable performer.This motto of the film is not only true, but so powerfully true that the term Rashomon Effect was coined to signify the differing perceptions of individuals over singular events, and has been used in both psychological and jurisprudential venues. Ultimately, the film is about even more than the difficulties of interpreting reality and truth, but about how and why they swerve under the force of mere human egoism. Of course, the beauty of the film really lies in the fact that all of its viewers think it's about something other than what it may ultimately be about, which only recapitulates the internal characters' dilemmas, further binding us emotionally in their angst, making us feel what they live. In this empathy Kurosawa cinches and twists that bind, and we are turned from mere percipients into purveyors of an art and reality for our own selves that we, unfortunately, too rarely experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen a sword fight like the final one (the final version) in Rashomon. The husband and the bandit both act like REAL PEOPLE -- scared of death and horrified at the prospect of killing someone else... I know there have been war movies that have shown people act this human.There's been gunfights where you see the hand shaking and the terror in the eyes.But any other sword fight I've seen seems mostly to show off fencing skills. Can anyone name another sword fight in a movie that shows shaking hands and horror in the eyes? I'd really like to know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kurosawa's manipulation of storytelling is still a masterpiece over fifty years later</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I wouldn't say this is the Kurosawa film I enjoy the most (I like his more entertaining samurai pictures), its truly a masterpiece thats still mind blowing all these years later. In my mind, for a film to be considered a masterpiece, it has to be both technically brilliant and an emotionally powerful experience. "Rashomon" definitely falls into both categories. Also, the movie forces the viewer to think about what hes just seen. It's Kurosawa's great manipulation of storytelling. The film describes an event four times as seen through the eyes of people who witnessed it. These highly subjective recollections are related by an additional storyteller. All this is related to the audience by the filmmaker - so we're never actually aware what the truth to the incident is or if it even happened for that matter. This format was highly influential and later copied in subsequent films, but it was never equaled.The film, as mentioned earlier, is extremely well made in addition to being a powerful and provocative experience. Kurosawa's direction is great as usual. He was one of the few masters of cinema who could fashion a truly entertaining film. Unlike many other regarded masterpieces of world cinema, his films are never dull and can be enjoyed even by the casual viewer in addition to the film buff. The acting is very good (espescially by Toshiro Mifune who displays the charisma that would come to fruition in Kurosawa's later samurai epics), but the film is more about the plot and direction than the performances. "Rashomon" is an amazing film that simply gets better and better with each viewing. (10/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is nothing but a Run-Down, Dilapidated Gate called Rashomon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rashomon gate is ran down, dilapidated, and the paint is chipped up. This is the scenery used on the films' DVD cover, and where the Buddhist monk, the woodcutter, and the servant tell the story of the murder. The three men hear the story from the servant's point of view, and as he tells it, there are flashbacks to the actual scenes. The whole story is centered on a trial, trying to find the killer. Each suspect and witness tells his or her side to the story to the police. However, whom they are telling their side of the story to, is unknown. It seems as if they are telling their side of the story to the audience. The film shows different camera views that were brand new to the time. In 1950, no one pointed the camera to the sky, or followed the character. The camera work, to the time, was very good. To the modern audience, it may look bad, but realize that they didn't have computers or enhanced cameras to add special cinematic elements to the film. As in most Eastern films, nature is shown to the extreme. Certain parts of the movie seem to be dragged out by showing too much nature with the woods and the weather. However, nature is common in eastern culture films. In addition, it is a very Shinto idea to show nature as being very large, and the actor being rather small. The actors did a very good job, especially Tajomaru, the bandit, who loved to show off his annoying, and sinister laugh. The movies whole set was taken outside, which was very uncommon in the 1950's. The movie had some bolero and traditional Japanese music to add some flavor. The plot of the movie was very smart. It showed flashbacks, new to the cinema in the 1950's. The central idea may seem old and overused, but it seems that murder cases never get boring. The ending leaves the audience in shock on who the actual killer is. The social commentary wasn't noticeable due to the English subtitles. This film is entertaining if the audience will view it from a 1950 perspective and not a 2007 perspective. The camera work is amazing to the time when it was filmed, and the plot was very good. However, the pace seemed a little slow, but once you can get over that it is entertaining. I suggest that you view this film with an open mind, allowing the slow pace to not bother you (or the subtitles), and get a quick background of the movie and director before you watch the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the Bible, Pilate asks, "What is truth?" and, as Roger Bacon puts it, "would not stay for an answer." I felt a bit the same way after seeing this remarkable film by Japan's celebrated film maker, Akira Kurosawa. It is set in 12th century Japan, and while most viewers would say it examines the nature of truth and finds it slippery, I think it more properly examines the nature of the feudal Japanese society. We have as representatives of that society, a priest (Minuru Chiaki) and a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) sitting out a rain storm in an abandon temple named Rashomon. It might pass for a ruined Greek temple except that its pillars and roof are made of wood. The priest and the woodcutter declare that they just can't understand it. They shake their heads and stare at the ground. Along comes a commoner (Kichijiro Uedo), a cynical man who asks what it is that they cannot understand.They have witnessed an investigation into the death of a samurai, Takehiro (Masayuki Mori). He is in some ways the equivalent of a medieval knight. He has a horse and lady, Masako (Machiko Kyo). The accused is an infamous outlaw named Tajomaru (played brilliantly by Toshiro Mifune, who obviously had a lot of fun with the part). He tells his story. He admits to having his way with the lady, but lets the court know that she liked it so much that she began to embrace him while her husband was tied up watching. Afterwards he says that she insisted that they fight over her. Tajomaru obliges. He cuts the rope holding Takehiro and they sword fight. Tajomaru wins.Next the wife tells her story. It is different of course. This causes the court to get a medium (Fumiko Honma) to tell the story from the point of view of the dead Takehiro. His story is different yet again. Finally the woodcutter reveals to the priest and the commoner that he saw the whole thing, and he then gives his version, again different of course.The commoner has some terrifically cynical lines. Here are three: "It's human to lie. Most of the time we can't even be honest with ourselves." (To the priest:) "Not another sermon! I don't mind a lie if it's interesting." "Man just wants to forget the bad stuff, and believe in the made-up good stuff. It's easier that way." He speaks for the natural or animalistic man.His counterpoint, the priest, opines, "If men don't trust each other, this earth might as well be hell." He speaks for moral man.Near the end of the film a baby is discovered crying. The woodcutter, who has five or six children of his own, takes the baby home.He represents civilized man.Masako represents the samurai's view of the nature of women when she is heard to say, "A man has to make a woman his by his sword." What impressed me most about this film is the way Kurosawa was able to create an emotional atmosphere in each of the sittings. "In the Grove" we feel the trees and the light that sparkles through the leaves, and the disturbed serenity. At Rashomon in the rain we feel the men isolated and waiting, and in the sterile court scene we feel the severity of the tragedy.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>There is no absolute truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look at any trial. Attorneys for both sides present their version of the truth. Witnesses line up on either team and "testify" as to the "truth." How can there be so many versions of the truth? Truth may be in the eye of the beholder, but 99 times out of 100, it's not the real truth."Roshomon," by the incredible Japanese director, Akira Kurosawa ("The Seven Samurai,"), deals with three people stranded at Roshomon during an intense rain storm. They are: a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura), a priest (Minoru Chiaki), and a nomad (Kichijiro Ueda). The woodcutter is ravaged due to a murder trial he witnessed, and proceeds to tell them everything that occurred for the duration of the storm.We hear four versions of a murder and we are left to believe that none of the versions are correct. The truth really lies in a composite of the four; but what pieces should be left out? Of course, there is some really great samurai action throughout.This movie never explains what happens. This film presents us the facts, but allows the viewer to debate over it.It is no wonder to why it won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film. "Rashomon" is after all a fable of man's inability to tell the truth, and one of those films which you discuss and rack through your mind over and over again, looking for the truth. I know the ultra right will be upset with me, but this film is a perfect illustration that all truth is relative. There are no absolutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rashomon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pretty simple-looking film that disguises an Old Testament story about the challenge of a man's faith. I the story of Job, Job is a reverent man who loves God and family. He is known for his wisdom and wealth. One day, Lucifer wagers Job's soul that he can make Job curse God. God takes the bet.Pestilence and disaster reign in Job's life. All the while, he holds his faith close as others prompt him to curse God by saying "God hates you. He is playing with your soul because he is a whimsical God. Curse him." Though he questions the reasons for what befalls him, his faith never wavers. God wins the wager.In Rashoman, there is a converse story. A priest's faith is in question, not of God, but of the true nature of humankind. He hears of a hideous crime and the controversial accounts of what happened. Other people, witnesses to the crime, come forth and give contradicting testimony. These people are like Job's neighbors, all revealing their philosophical "conviction" by confessing to a crime. Each story accuses a different culprit, and each suspect is motivated and justified by extreme self centeredness. At the end, no one knows who is telling the truth. But the man who offers to adopt the orphan restores the priest's faith in humanity. Each of these people, like Job's neighbors, challenge the reverent man's faith by revealing a different aspect of man's (lack of) character.Every account revolves around the woman's relationship to the men in the movie. In some way, each man wants to possess her and justify his existence in so doing. And let's face it; in 1954 post war Japoan, a conservative state by our standards then and now, you wouldn't likely see a woman laughing at a man and insulting him openly like the wife in this movie. In that context, you can conclude this is socially a consciousness-raising film for that time and place.As Kurosawa goes, this is an early, foundational work that appears to establish him as one with broad knowledge about western culture and literature, astute cinematography, and a talent for taking the traditions of theatre and film as a cornerstone for expanding his work instead of resorting to cheap and hollow impressionism.I give this a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Indisputable Kurosawa Masterwork Given Worthy Criterion Treatment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leave it to the Criterion Collection to give Akira Kurosawa's seminal 1950 masterpiece its due in this superb 2002 DVD package. First, renowned Japanese film scholar Donald Richie provides a terrifically insightful commentary as he does on classics of other Japanese genres, Yasujiro Ozu's family drama, "Early Summer" (1951), and Kô Ichiwara's sun-tribe melodrama, "Crazed Fruit" (1956). Second, there is a seventeen-minute excerpt about the film from a feature-length documentary about its masterful cinematographer, "World of Kazuo Miyagawa", who did similarly amazing work on Kenji Mizugochi's "Ugetsu" (1953) and Ozu's "Floating Weeds" (1959). Third, if you choose to buy rather than rent the DVD, there is a beautifully designed booklet with relevant excerpts from Kurosawa's autobiography and the two short stories by Ryunosuke Akutagawa from which Kurosawa and co-writer Shinobu Hashimoto based their screenplay. Add a brief testimonial introduction by Robert Altman, and this becomes one of the best of the Criterion Collection DVDs.Set in feudal 12th-century Japan, it is a far more intimate film than its vaunted reputation leads one to believe and quite brief at 88 minutes. Ostensibly a courtroom drama, the multi-layered story focuses on the rape of a woman and the murder of her husband in a forest grove. The events of the crimes are told from four different perspectives - a swaggering bandit named Tajômaru, a woodcutter who witnesses the crime, the wife and even the murdered husband by way of a medium. Each account unfolds in a distinct style - an extravagant samurai adventure according to Tajômaru, the wife's melodramatic recollection as a victim, a heroic martyr's tale from the dead husband. In a blessedly economical style, the contradictions in their accounts multiply as the story unfolds.The framing device is the woodcutter's own flashback of the incident as told to a commoner, but his version is far from the definitive one as he may have stolen a dagger from the crime scene. Kurosawa does such a brilliantly dexterous job in structuring the differing accounts that as the film progresses, it becomes less about seeking the truth and more about the power and inevitable conflicts arising from everyone's sense of ego. The only thing that becomes clear by the end is how individual perceptions shape reality and that the absolute truth is a myth. Miyagawa's expert camera-work is stellar in a way that raises the bar for subsequent cinema, especially the vivid facial close-ups of the main characters, the sharp angles of the sun-dappled forest scenes, and the dramatically ink-tinted raindrops.A sterling cast has been assembled with Kurosawa's muse, Toshiro Mifune, a feral presence as Tajômaru. Masayuki Mori and an especially vibrant Machiko Kyô, who later reunited in the ghostly "Ugetsu", lend particular distinction to the couple ensnared by the tragic situation, and the three legendary actors show impressive versatility in highlighting different aspects of their personalities in the various accounts. Takashi Shimura, who later starred in Kurosawa's poignant "Ikuru", is also superb as the woodcutter. Many filmmakers have since copied Kurosawa's then-daring narrative structure (for example, Martin Ritt's "The Outrage" and Edward Zwick's "Courage Under Fire"), but none comes close to capturing the pervasive sense of ambiguity that makes this movie retain its initial power.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rashomon: Kurosawa's First Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rashomon: (1950): Starring Toshiro Mifune, Machiko Kyo, Masayuki Mori, Takashi Shimura, Minoru Chiaki, Kichijiro Ueda, Fumiko Honma, Daisuke Kato......Director Akira Kurosawa, Screenplay Ryunosuke Akutagawa, Shinobu Hashimoto.Acclaimed Director Akira Kurosawa's film "Rashomon", released in 1950, is his first great film success, and he would go on to direct many great films well into the 70's and 80's. For its time, Rashomon was a powerful and new kind of foreign film and represented the best of Japanese cinema during the post-World War II/Hiroshima bombing period. It's a story of a single act of dishonor and crime, told in four varying accounts in testimony at a trial. A woodcutter and a priest tell the baffling tale to a commoner who is passing through the Rashomon Gate. A newly wed couple, of a high ranking social standing in feudal Japan, encounter a common highway robber who rapes the bride and kills the Samurai husband. Although the act of rape and murder has been committed and is not denied, the reasons as to why this happened at all are entirely different. Takehiro, the Samurai, witnesses his wife Masako being raped and feels shame, for in one version, she is clearly enjoying being ravished. Jealous, hurt and dishonored, he asks the robber Tajomaro kill him, which he does. Another eyewitness reports that the wife attempted to kill herself after being raped and after watching her husband die but she didn't have the courage to go through with it. In yet another account, Masako ordains the robber to kill her husband for his failure to protect her. The simplest explanation seems to be that the robber merely killed the husband and raped the wife, but there seems to be more going on. No one seems to be telling the truth, despite the fact that Masako and Tajomaro are both part of the triangle and know what really happened. Even the murdered Samurai speaks his testimony from beyond the grave using a medium. We don't know what really happens, and Kurosawa purposely leaves the whole thing as a big mystery, layered with ambiguity. This makes for a very engaging crime mystery, one that is well-written and full of a haunting sense of despair, frustration and bitterness. It's as if Kurosawa is telling us that life in general is a mystery and that evil is complex and even unknowable. Without being overly philosophical, this confusing story creates a huge impact over the audience, leaving them to decide for themselves which of the accounts is the best possibility. The music, the cinematography and the fine acting are each components of the beauty of this movie. Kurosawa can credit this one film, early in his career, as the film that launched his fame as director. It garnered the attention of the world to his movies. He became one of the most well-known Japanese directors of the 20th century and was wealthy enough to endorse his own brand of "saki" wine in commercials in which he appeared himself. Far from the superficial crime dramas of today, Rashomon stands as a classic example of a good crime movie.</fullReview>

During the trial, four people - Tajomaru, the woman, the deceased man (speaking through a priest) and an eyewitness - tell the story from their point of view, and therefore give four different versions of the story. Who should be trusted? Who's telling the truth?If you're expecting a linear story with no ambiguity, you're watching the wrong movie: in this masterpiece, Akira Kurosawa doesn't want to find out the truth, he wants to tell a story about life, mankind and its future (one of the characters is a monk who's beginning to lose faith in men), and he does it beautifully, moving from one location to another (the abandoned monastery where three people try to figure out what "truth" means, the square where the trial is held, and the forest where the crime takes place) and showing conflicted, dishonest, but human, people, played by wonderful actors (Kurosawa-regular Mifune is the standout as the ambiguous thief). It's a world ruled by doubt, fear and lies, although there still can be hope that mankind will improve someday.For those who would like to get acquainted with Kurosawa's enchanting world, Rashomon is an excellent start: I've only seen it once myself but it's already in my personal TOP 50.

		<fullReview>Rashamon is an incredibly influential film. In 1951 it seemed odd indeed with its five points of view, it's camera movement, it's melancholy theme, rape and murder. There is also a self-mocking element to the Samurai sword fighting and Kimono doll histrionics. The overacting is actually snide sarcasm about Japanese film or societal convention. Japanese film folks were surprised Western viewers grasped these ideas. After all, American Westerns have their formal rituals, the gunfight at noon, the horsy loner, and so on. 12th Century Samurai and their sword fighting, the status of women in Japan, their victimization, all is standard film fare in the East.This one is a thoughtful film with interesting, original cinematography, but for those looking for huge battles as shown in the later Ran, this one is a Perry Mason court case.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never did it cross my mind that Toshiro Mifune was the same man who played Sanjuro in "Yojimbo". In this movie is shows raw and reckless masculinity, one I've never seen in the later Kurosawa film I mentioned above. Each one of the characters has a version for the crime, including the one from the spirit of the dead husband. In the end, an event with an abandoned child and the symbolic appearance of the sun shine return hope in human race for the priest as he has shown disgust on the lawlessness of humanity. Although some may interpret that the little bit of somewhat ominous music as the woodcutter is walking away from the temple suggests he's expedient intentions of taking the baby. Or could the resolve have been just the priest's character arc of regaining hope in man despite the fact that he might have been duped by the woodcutter - who is unprincipled like the woman, the husband and the bandit? There is much ambiguity here which is what makes this movie interesting and as I've been told a more sophisticated storytelling for it's time. Although, out of personal taste I prefer YOJIMBO, Rashomon's ending was a payoff,and maybe even a twist (if the woodcutter was just as evil as everyone else is), but Yojimbo was more a payoff to me with the town inevitably becoming a quiet place... for awhile. Rashomon is Grade A- in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much more than a twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before there was Kurosawa, there was "Rashomon;" the Japanese master's cinematic triumph is what began to open Western audiences to his country's rich film history. Though most of the reviewers here understand the power of Kurosawa's revolutionary narrative, I think some have placed a bit too much emphasis on the surprise and plot-discovery. Though correct, the classics don't become classics unless there's something besides the occasional plot twist, and its for these other reasons that "Rashomon" will continue to endure beyond original but thematically empty works like "Memento." Other than the traditional staples accorded to this film like the maniacal acting and gritty cinematography, "Rashomon" is quite simply a testament to the visual power of cinema. Adapted from a short story by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, the device in literature of multiple perspectives telling different versions of the same story is nothing groundbreaking; what is remarkable is Kurosawa's presentation. We aren't really ever told what happens; we SEE each and every story, and it's those obvious and not so obvious differences one must note and observe to get the entire idea. Kurosawa here was doing something extraordinary: he managed to deliver one powerful message on the darkness of the human heart through four ostensibly different narratives of the same event, but without ever providing any semblance of a corrective; it's a mystery that is unexpectedly ? and inexplicably - never solved, but because of the distinct characters and intensely dramatic nature of the situation, we forget this while realizing afterwards such obfuscation of a "correct" version is the very point."Rashomon" goes beyond the short story it is based on by delivering not just different events in each telling, but also a totally different mood via sparse music and flawless camera placement. No story ever duplicates itself in technique, and the result is essentially four separate short films tied together with one unflinching narrative thread. The themes of despair are thus delivered on several levels: the narratives, the performances, and the actual structure of the film itself. This, frankly, is something cinema can only accomplish. The glib bleakness of the thing presses upon us further and further upon every warped retelling. But perhaps Kurosawa thankfully couldn't completely stomach the hopeless nature of mankind just yet (as he would show in the unrelenting "The Lower Depths" and even "The Bad Sleep Well"). As the too-pat but ultimately uplifting ending suggests, mankind is merciless, but family life can provide shelter against the onslaught of a storm.Lastly, like nearly all of his other films, I don't think Kurosawa was trying to deliver any existential message on the loss of truth in contemporary society here as well. The director himself said he wished this film was more timely when he accepted the Palme d'Or at Cannes. More to the point, if we consider that there is no truth, none of these characters ? the bandit, the aristocrat, et.al ? could willingly lie right? To quote another insightful reviewer on IMDb on a different Kurosawa classic, the man was a humanist, not an existentialist. Even with its tiny flaws and detractors (Pauline Kael infamously carped that the film was marred by a score that sounded like Ravel's "Bolero"), "Rashomon" is perfect enough. It's a classic, after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It doesn't get any better than this for the thinking film fan. Great acting, humour in places you really wouldn't expect to find it, amazing cinematography and a kick that will make you want to watch it all over again.The main theme is the idea of a non-existent truth, there can be no such thing as the truth when your idea of it is different to mine. Originally a tale in an old Japanese book, the film is the story of a murder told from the four perspectives of the people involved (including the victim, who is chanelled through a gyrating spirit-translator). It has a moral, and is in my opinion one of Kurosawa's best. This is what film is capable of, this is what the medium should be producing - great stories that will stick with us for the rest of our lives and live on far long after.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The intricacy of the human mind couldn't have been implemented in simpler words</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa, possibly the greatest film-maker to come out of Asia, has tried to explain one of the fundamental truths about life - that each man views it from a different perspective and that his actions are governed by selfish desires. Man desires hope to achieve his goals, ironically, it is man who is also the one who can take it away.The entire movie is about 90 minutes with just enough dialogues to fill about 3 pages. The cast has only 6 characters with no special effects, no trick photography(if even existed at that time), no panoramic locations, not even a fake blood spatter. Yet, it has unparalleled detail and complexity. If not the best, it certainly is one of the best implementations of directing and screenplay in the history of cinema. Basic synopsis : "Spoiler Alert"Three people tell their version of a heinous crime committed near osaka, Japan. All have different details with each one trying to save his honour. The mystery of who is right and wrong seems to have been solved when the 4th version is revealed. Little does it matter thought when even this version has its own new culprit. A display of "evil" and an act of retribution brings about the twist and unravels ideology behind the movie.Overall, one needs about 90 minutes to watch this movie and a lifetime to show their praise for it. A timeless classic that shouldn't be missed.Thank you</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest films ever made, in any language</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest films I've ever seen, in any language, I might add. A haunting, unforgettable classic from the directorial genius, Akira Kurosawa. Its truly unlike any movie you've ever seen before. It examines and questions the very essence of truth. Its incredible that it was made in 1950, even today, its still a staggering and enduring influence on cinema throughout the world. 'Rashomon' is truly an unconventional and existential film with a non-linear narrative. It is such a profound film that even if you see it numerous times, you'll still be picking out things you didn't notice previously. Its punctuated with poetic metaphors and symbolisms throughout. Now I know where great American directors like Robert Altman, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, etc, all get their inspiration from. I love Kurosawa's expressionistic approach to film-making. His use of camera angles, lighting, etc, is a treat to behold. This film basically tells the story of a priest, a woodcutter, a thief and an ordinary man who all take turns narrating, through flashbacks, the same series of events while waiting out a heavy rainstorm. They all discuss the brutal murder of a Samurai and the rape of his wife they claim they witnessed in the jungle. You, the viewer, like the characters in the film, are never sure what is real and what isn't. It is never explained, you're forced to draw your own conclusions. What you hear is four completely different stories of the crimes committed in the woods. Every storyteller is untrustworthy, especially the woodcutter's, who was the first to see evidence of the crimes. This film has a very powerful and spiritual ending where the woodcutter get a shot a redemption. I can see why this film is still very influential and important since its release 54 years ago. An unqualified masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While Rashômon is a flawless film technically, and I'm certain that it was innovative and refreshing when it first came out, there have been so many imitations and rehashes of the concept that, seeing Rashômon 54 years after it was first released, the film seems to lack the initial punch which it probably had.While I certainly recognize that this film is a masterpiece simply because it was the first to use the concept of a same story told from different points of view, the story itself failed to really touch me. The moral of the story is excellent, but the plot doesn't seem to take you any deeper than that. I "got it" after watching it the first time, and see little reason to go back and see it again. Technically, the film is outstanding. The shots in the forest are beautifully filmed, and the shots looking directly into the sunlight are certainly very interesting. Furthermore, Kurosawa's use of black ink to help contrast the rain with the sky gives beautiful results.Overall, while the film was certainly way ahead of its time, I don't believe that time has actually made this classic any better. The countless imitators have only made this film seem less original that it probably was on release, and while I recognize it was the first, the story doesn't seem to pack as much punch as it should.8/10 (if only for the technical achievements and the inspiration it served as for future filmmakers)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie's use of conflicting flashbacks has been copied a great deal since 1950, and so it does not amaze us the way it must have viewers of the time. Eventually, however, Kurosawa's powerful images and emotions do engross us: The numb shock of the men recalling the testimonies, the mysterious, bleak self-hatred of the people who confess to the killing, the passionate extremes of behaviour in the flashback sequences. These combine to reach an extreme pitch; the film even manages to pull off the gamble of showing us a speech straight from hell.The ending is curious. If it were to be taken at face value and we were to simply accept that the priest's faith in human nature had been justly restored, I might find it tacked-on and blindly faithful. But it seems more complex than that -- appropriate for Kurosawa, who throughout his life went through bouts of severe cynicism and depression. If there's positivity to be gotten from it, it's this: Yes, humans are terrible animals, and we do not have an innate sense of principle, but at least we're able to learn from our mistakes, understand the concepts of right and wrong, shame ourselves into doing better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Akira Kurosawa is God.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like it or not, Rashomon IS one of the most brilliantly constructed movies of all time (I know I'm ripping off Leonard Maltin, but he put it sooo well!), and it's unquestionably one of the greatest films I have ever seen. Starring Kurosawa favourites, Takashi Shimura as the humble woodchopper, I'm damn sure the priest was in The Seven Samurai (the one from the "Wood Cut School"!), and of course, the irrepressible Toshiro Mifune as the crazed bandit Tajomaru, the film is incredibly well acted all round, yet any credit due for the performances pales in comparison to the supreme achievement of Akira Kurosawa, who of course directed and partially wrote the screenplay.With a surface complexity on par with "Citizen Kane" (yet admittedly not quite as good, but hey! How many films are?), "Rashomon" is incredibly gripping, and packed to the brim with great GREAT scenes. I'd had my money's worth after about 15 min into the movie, even IF I'd gotten the parking ticket I risked to catch the movie at the cinema! (I just LOVE that bit where Shimura walks in the woods with the axe on his shoulder!) 'Rashomon' is everything a movie should be, it's funny, sad, frightening, horrific, exciting, tense, depressing, uplifting, thought-provoking, even haunting.Every single movie ever made has flaws (some movies simply have more than others) and 'Rashomon' is no exception (it is JUST outside my top 10). However, I believe this movie belongs to an imaginary select group that stand as gospels of cinematic technique ('Citizen Kane' and 'Battleship Potemkin' included. I would also like to nominate Tsui Hark's 'Once Upon a Time in China', but I think the real critics might be against me on that one!), and stands today, almost half a century old, as 90 of the most rewarding minutes you'll ever spend in front of a screen.This movie is testament to the genius of one of the greatest filmmakers to have ever lived, and embodies some of the most important and greatest messages that have ever needed saying. I should also add that it's nothing next to "The Seven Samurai", but that's another story.'Kurosawa' was understandably passed over for the Academy Award for Best Director. Why he failed to win the Nobel Prize is a far greater mystery...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A samurai and his wife are travelling through the forest when they meet a bandit. At some point after this interaction, the samurai is dead and his body is found by a woodcutter passing through. Of this much we can be sure. The bandit is arrested for the murder but, at the trial, he, the wife and the spirit of the dead man (via a medium) tell different version of events.Rashômon is the subject of my favourite Simpsons' joke and is also one of those films that it is polite to mention in conversation when discussing anything that uses different points of view on events as the basis for its narrative ? whether it be Hero, Boomtown, Vantage Point or whatever. So, with these things in mind I thought I should probably at least watch it for myself. Having watched a few longer films from Kurosawa, I was surprised to find this so short and brisk but I suppose this comes from the fact that there is not a lot of material within the film. As others have said, the scenario is the same with each telling and effectively the film is "nothing more" than several different ways of events playing out to the same outcome. Then it is over and you never really know the truth. I can understand why those unwilling to get into the film, just dismiss it. It is "dull" I suppose by some standards and the ending is open in regards the events that had gone before and also seems to come from nowhere (not unlike the baby, which is a rather lazy device in my opinion).These are flaws within the film perhaps and I do recognise that the film is not perfect ? in particular with the conclusion to the film ? Kurosawa may be highly regarded but he is not free from criticism. What the film does do very well is to tell the versions of events in a way that is true to the character and in a way that tells us a lot about the characters. Some have had the lack of shame to come on this site complaining that it is the same story again and again but they are missing the point badly. Each twist on the truth is done for personal reasons, whether they be major changes or just minor embellishments. It is a tad disappointing that the differences are so extreme though and I would have liked to see events a lot tighter but with just as telling, but more subtle differences. It still works though and it does provide some material for thought about the nature of truth and how hard it is to get to one version of any event that can be agreed on.The cast do well to vary their characters between the telling to reflect how they are presented in the version that suits the teller of the tale. The three main actors of Mifune, Kyô and Mori work well together ? with Mifune and Kyô in particular delivering the most as their material allows. The framing scenes with the woodcutter etc are also good and I think the only weaknesses with their performances come from how they have to present this story as the worst thing ever, which is not an impression I ever shared. For the court scenes we are added Honman as a medium; she throws herself into the performance and it is only a shame that I struggle to buy her character as a narrative device in the first place. The direction is low-key but still impressive ? mainly due to shooting in heavy rain, and in the woods ? neither appear affected by the challenges as the lighting and shot framing is always excellent.Rashômon will disappoint people because almost everyone will have been told what a classic it is and will expect to be blown away second by second. Which of course doesn't happen and the film is not as subtle or as clever as one would hope. However it is still a well constructed, interesting and thought-provoking piece that is punchy and engaging with strong performances and direction. Don't expect something that it is not and come to it with an open mind and you will find a film that justifies the majority of its reputation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One can easily compare this to Kubrick's early works: both directors are ambitious yet restrained, both films rely on simple acting, and both try to exploit the use of black and white. Kubrick didn't use the coloring right until 'Dr. Strangelove' because there the blandness was intentional and, I might add, effective in making the depressing shades of gray more apparent. Unfortunately for Kurosawa, the B&amp;W doesn't help here.I really don't consider this one of Kurosawa's best. I feel he hit his real visual chord with 'Throne of Blood' then amplified it through 'Ran'. Even 'Yojimbo' rings stronger than 'Rashômon'. Perhaps it's because we've had so many "twisted story" movies by upstart writers (much like the "running man" genre) that we don't get the fresh feel of the story like we used to. This isn't a failure, but rather a tarnished gem brought on by a history of repeats and ripoffs.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i have seen kurosawa's Seven Samurai and I think it is a great movie, at least from direction point of view it was superb plus some great acting. But after watching Roshomon I was highly disappointed, too much hype of this movie and I won't even say it's good (forget great). I mean this is a drama movie involving 3 main characters and very limited freedom for director as far as visuals are concerned, since the movie repeats same story 4 times from different perspectives. So how strong or weak the movie is, is going to depend on - how spellbinding is storytelling and performance by protagonists. And alas Roshomon lags far behind expectations in both departments. Apart from Toshiro Mifune no one was able to hold the screen with their presence. Expressions were too weak to potray the kind of emotions, intensity and dilemma required for the storyline. As far as script is concerned for this genre of movies, audience shall feel connected to some character in the movie, but to me it wasn't the case, the characters were half baked.Conclusion: there are much better movies, too overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is truth?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is essentially a silent film. The dialogue, which is sparse and straightforward, is almost unnecessary. Everything we need to know is shown to us, and shown to us with amazing skill. I can think of few other films that have been as visually profound as this one. Kurosawa is a master painter. He has such an deep, innate understanding of composition and framing. Another such genius is Bergman. They have such skill in conveying emotion and mood with every frame. Speaking of Bergman, this film is similar in many respects to his masterpiece "Persona." Both films undermine their own authority by questioning whether or not film, or mankind for that matter, can be objective. Do we have the ability to determine truth? Are we competent enough to convey that truth? The films are very different in subject matter, but in artistry and philosophy, they are nearly identical. I find it amazing that "Rashomon" was made over 10 years before "Persona." I read one comment that compared "Rashomon" with "Hero." I thought "Hero" was a pretty good movie. It certainly was good looking, with striking choreography. However, "Hero" "cheated" in that it used color to establish mood and perspective. Though it did do it rather expertly, Kurosawa was working in glorious black and white. He had to use composition and shading--a far more difficult task. Yet he pulled it off with panache. I never doubted that I was looking at the same "truth" from a entirely different perspective. This film, though highly cynical, did end on a note of optimism. It wasn't forced or contrived. It fit perfectly smoothly into the storyline. Not many directors could do that. Kurosawa didn't remain as optimistic. One of the most cynical, dreadful endings I have ever seen was Kurosawa's later film, "Ran." That film ends with no hope, no glimmer of goodness, no confidence in mankind. The films were made 35 years apart. Amazing how an individual's perspective can change over the years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best concept Kurosawa has ever done. You have what would be one long extended scene played four times over. Each time one of the witnesses tells their side of the story, it changes. There's never any question that a murder did occur. The mystery in Rashomon is figuring out who is telling the truth. Or to be even more descriptive, who's story has the least amount of holes. It was a pleasure to watch this. This is what is missing from modern day mystery movies. A great mystery doesn't need to be spelled out to the audience. It's always better to leave a lot up to the individual viewer's interpretation. There are three pieces that hold Rashomon together. The script, which written in 1950 is still smarter and more compelling than all the countless Kurosawa imitators in the years that have followed. The acting brings out the script with so much life and energy. I'm not sure anyone can match Toshiro Mifune's insane madness. The woman gives the most interesting performance in the movie. She actually changes subtle things in her performance from one flashback to the next. Last, the third piece is of course Kurosawa himself. He has become the greatest Director who ever lived. Rashomon was his breakthrough, and it has actually become more well received over time. While it won the Oscar for best Foreign film in 1950, these days it would be handed every Oscar it would be eligible for. Kazuo Miyagawa captured in Rashomon the best Cinematography for any black and white movie. It actually looks more stunning than most color movies. While Seven Samurai and Ran are my very favourite Kurosawa films, Rashomon has to be the most interesting structurally. Mystery does not get better than this.</fullReview>

Rashomon is a very clever idea which questions the whole notion of truth at ground level. We have the same story told through the mask of 4 different characters, and this makes gripping watching. It asks the questions, who is telling the truth? To make things even more confusing, how do we know that anyone is actually telling the truth. Everyone puts their own slant on the storyThe film has spawned many others following the same theme. Most famous is probably The Usual Subjects, which does not attempt to hide the fact that Rashomon gave it all its ideas.

Four different views of the incident are given to us, from the the Bandit, the woman, the dead husband (via psychic medium), and a woodcutter who witnessed it from the bushes.For simple minds, they will try to decipher who is telling the truth and who isn't, as if the situation is that simple and absolute. My friend 'Jenni' is convinced the woodcutter had to have told the truth, and everyone else is lying. There, simple as that. Not to get all philosophical, but everyone is right. Each person tells their version of it, and in their minds, nothing can be disproved. It is THEIR truth.But don't listen to me; go rent the movie and judge it for yourself.

		<shortDescription>Search for the meaning of truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rashomon deals with a concept embodied in Japanese culture - the subjectiveness of truth - and presents it in a very occidental way.The film is rich and multi-layered in its use of montage, mise-en-sc?ne, the play of light and shadows in its forest sequences (Kurosawa always admitted that Jean Renoir had been one of his earliest influences), skillful make-up (especially in the sequence where the wife is "possessed" by her dead husband's spirit), theatrical opposition of the players and has a haunting score. These factors give it a visual quality which is intriguing and almost dream-like.The characters are supremely well-performed, especially by the always-impressive Toshiro Mifune (representing the bandit) and also by Machiko Kyo (representing the nobleman's wife). It is said that before shooting began each day Kurosawa showed Mifune a short film of a wild lion in the jungle and asked the actor to imitate the creature - after seeing the agitated, nervous and mannerism-ridden bandit he represents I believe it. Kyo was apparently a relative newcomer to film-making and if so this was a very impressive debut as the in-turns faithful, treacherous, child-like and manipulative wife.Of course, the film attracts its interest chiefly from the story itself (four people tell differing versions of a murder and rape, with three of them individually taking responsibility for the murder) - endless analyses have been made to explain it or pronounce it unexplainable but most people agree that it deals with the subjectiveness of the concept of truth. What we regard as true seems to always be heavily influenced by our own standpoint. Without wishing to reduce the film's message or taint its ambience of mystery - one of its great appeals - I have to say that I found the woodcutter's version the most plausible.Although re-filmed by Hollywood as the Outrage (1964) and obviously inspiring more recent films (Courage Under Fire, Snake Eyes) the original is unsurpassable in visual splendor, the vividness of its characters and its enigmatic plot.</fullReview>

It's not a disc that I watch over and over (maybe once a year), but, when I DO watch it, I always come away from it amazed -- perhaps "shaken" is a more apt description -- at the depth of its insights. Even for Kurosawa, this film is a revelation. I just hope that someone sees fit to release it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie i've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie made me think over and over after i saw it, cos the story is so dense, you just have to figure it all out, you are led to it... It plays with your mind! It is simply superbe, you always seem to know the essential but when you see carefully, things aren't what you thought in the first place!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently rented Rashomon again. I've seen it at least 5 times and I still really enjoy it. Each key character is examined through different eyes and aspects of their character are revealed. I saw the different perspectives as revealing various flavors of the same personality. The character examined contained all of the personalities revealed and they were perceived by the onlooker through the onlooker's own prejudices. The stories were told also by the character stressing their perception of the event and role in it. What was the true story? It was a combination of all the stories or none of them. This movie has been touted as more than a classic. It is an archetype. Watch it after the next OJish court decision hits the news.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK movie, but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the pleasure of seeing the newly (from 2008) restored version of this film on the big screen recently. It's hard to believe it's 59 years old, and I can imagine the original must be in bad shape.The restored version definitely looks good, but I was disappointed with the sound. I know they have the modern tools to make something like this sound better. It needs lots more noise reduction in some scenes, and some good use of multiband compression. For the layperson, that means the loud parts are too loud compared to the quiet parts. Unfortunately, in the theater I saw this, the quiet parts sounded just fine which meant that the loud parts - the wife's wailing, the baby's crying, etc. - were just earsplitting and painful.As for the story, it was very innovative at the time. As far as I know, no film before this used the storytelling technique of multiple unreliable narrators. The acting and directing is pretty good, not surprising, though the style is dated nowadays and some of the performances feel more like they should be on stage instead of on camera.I'll give this a 6/10. Knowing what Kurosawa and Mifune were later capable of, this is not even close to their best. But it's got historical significance and is a film every film lover should see at least once. But I don't feel compelled to go see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Foreign Language Film Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa made the greatest foreign language film ever. Brilliantly constructed screenplay. The film is humongously influential. We would not have movies like Usual Suspects and Go without it. The word has Rashomon has taken on it's own meaning in Japan. A masterpiece A+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good, but dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, Rashomon is, like every Kurosawa/Mifune film I've seen, beautifully crafted and brilliantly acted, but after watching the same thing over and over four times... it got a bit boring. I found by the end that I didn't really care which was the true story, but I think that might possibly be part of the point; the ending sequence is perfect however and I would recommend this to anyone, just with maybe two versions of events instead of four... Not my favourite Kurosawa film by a long way, but definitely one to add to the collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story about a man who doesn't understand what he doesn't understand...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I'd like to say that Rashomon doesn't deserve to take place high ranks in IMDb. Because I have seen lots of movies which have ordinary themes. If people don't care the quality of a film, we would be unfair to other top-class films like Goodfellas, Fargo, Godfather etc.Although the time of it is very short, I was very bored while watching. Not a fluent story, not an original theme and other factors. Only one point that I can say as good is the musical theme.Two men in a temple explains a story about a murder in forest and they don't understand how the story happened. The ferocious brigand Tajomaru, slain's wife, a witch who is capable to see past and lastly one of two men try to explain how the story happened. One of two men had seen the slain and his wife before the murder in forest. He believes Tajomaru came across with them after he saw them and Tajomaru should have killed the man.Finally, the main idea of the film is that how cruel people became. Although I criticize all the things related to it, it could realize a good job when it had been made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ZZZzzzz... ..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie not to long ago in a college film class and I must say that this could be "the" worst movie I have EVER seen. It's so bad that I wanted to post this note as a warning to those who watch it for he or she could fall directly into a coma. The story-line, although claimed to be "deep" is no more than what we already have recognized or thought about before, the acting is freakishly horrible (as much as that annoying woman cried I strongly believe the story involving her death was "the true story"), the dialogue was redundant and useless, and I overall Hated this movie! And by the way, several people fell asleep in class and I was more entertained by their snoring sounds.Thank you (first time posting).-- Travis Gauthier</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misses the point in this examination of good and evil.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Kurosawa's examination of good and evil, he missed the point. So very few storytellers know what makes good or evil. Rashamon is very Eastern in its philosophy, so it doesn't quite get it. It's not what we do that makes us good or evil. Doing good isn't the cause of good or evil in us, it's the result. I cannot see anyone come to any accurate conclusion about the heart of man by watching this film. Still, it was interesting and it wasn't without its entertainment value. Seeing the 4 conflicting stories intertwine was interesting. Even after watching the film, it's difficult to figure out which tale is the true one. I give it 5 stars on pure entertainment value. But don't expect a morality lesson when you watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Boomtown' Did It Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film which featured four different accounts of a rape and murder, seeing it from different. That's an interesting premise, and was copied, by the way, very well in an American television show a few years ago called "Boomtown."Unfortunately, "Boomtown" did a better job of it than director Akira Kurosawa. However, since Kurosawa is one of those "untouchables," meaning the critics always rave about anything the guy does (a la Bergman, Hitchcock, etc.) this movie gets great reviews.This is very slow moving, way too repetitive and extremely boring, even with the short playing time. The only redeemable quality is the cinematography. It's just laughable to read people calling this unbelievably-overrated snorefest "a masterpiece." What a stupid cliché!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is, according to me, a very bad movie. I was quite surprised to see that Rashomon was a horrible film, since everyone says that it is a great one. I was especially hit hearing the worst sound track. I really think that Kurosawa was not interested in music at all. And Rashomon is too much long. I have read the short story by Akutagawa(which is great), which is about 20 pages. Consequently, I do not understand why the film lasts so long. So I do not say that it is an awful movie, but I don't think that it is worth calling "the best movie in the world". I do not want to forbid to see the movie, since it is still interesting, but think by yourself before saying that it is super, as almost everybody say.</fullReview>
