		<shortDescription>A wan, earnest re-make of a classic thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing I can say for this film is that it enhances our appreciation of Alfred Hitchcock. His 1954 original has roughly the same running time, but it has so much more going on: A dozen recurring minor characters give texture to the script and complications to the plot. The plot itself involves far more twists, turns, and red herrings, plus twice as many confrontations between the heroine and the villain. The romantic relationship is far steamier, and the climactic scene is utterly original and totally terrifying.In this new version, the mystery story has been "streamlined" to allow more time for techno razzle-dazzle and detailed presentation of the challenges faced by the disabled every day. The cause is worthy, but the shotgun marriage of movie-of-the-week message with murder-mystery drama serves neither facet of the film very well.There are a few effective scenes, and the actors make the most of the feeble script. Christopher Reeves may be paralyzed from the neck down, but he knows how to use his handsome, highly expressive face and voice. You won't forget Jimmy Stewart, but you do get involved with Reeves' character. Reuben Santiago-Hudson is delightful in the Thelma Ritter role, and Robert Forster is fine as the hard-bitten cop. Darryl Hannah, alas, does little with less; a star willing to take on a Grace Kelley role deserves more support from her producers!If you'd like to support people with spinal cord injuries and see a good thriller, write a check to Christopher Reeves' foundation, then rent Hitch's masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gus Van Sant's remake of PSYCHO at least had an interesting premise behind it - is a clone of an art object in itself? We know the answer now :-)This appalling remake of REAR WINDOW has only one use, and that a cautionary one. You can't improve on perfection.OK - we all feel sorry for Christopher Reeve. What happened to him shouldn't happen to anybody. But giving him this role was either an act of misplaced kindness or one of cynical exploitation and CR's bank balance is the only thing that has benefited from this total abortion of a remake. Just about everything that was worth having in the original has been fubarred here.I'll stop here before I become *really* abusive. Avoid this turkey like the plague.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this re-make is OK as re-makes go, it would be next to impossible for anyone to equal the directing genius of Hitchcock or the mastery of Jimmy Stewart. As terrific an actor Christopher Reeves is, I think he bit off more than he could chew when he tried to re-make the character played by Jimmy Stewart, one of the greatest rated actors in motion picture history. The same goes for Darryl Hannah. She is a good actress, but one could easily argue the superiority of Grace Kelly. I admire the attempts of these people, however, when one ventures to remake a Hitchcock classic like Rear Window, one should stay closer to the original story line. They don't call him the master of suspense for nothing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What on earth was the point of this load of dross? I presume it was a vehicle for Mr Reeve? Hitchcock's Rear Window, was one of the greatest suspense films ever, the only suspense here was how long could I keep awake. Robert Forster ought to have known better, he is a superb actor and is just about the only character in this movie one can recognise as being bothered. Teleplays, with some honourable exceptions, are usually crap, but there was more wood in this script than in Sherwood Forest. Leave well alone when it comes to attempting to remake the classic movies, I admired Christopher Reeve for his heroic struggle against adversity, he will be remembered for doing many better things than this. If only I could have given it nought out of ten. DREADFUL.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so bad it does not deserve to bear the name of one of the greatest movies ever made. About the same as painting a VW red and calling it a Ferrari. Throughout the movie Hannah and Reed seemed to be disinterested in each other until the last scene when they suddenly kiss and pledge everlasting love. Where is this building? How can there be so many titillating scenes going on at the same time in full view? Doesn't anyone ever close the shades? Is this movie about a voyer or an entire population of exibitionists? I am ashamed to say that I watched the entire movie, but I was fascinated that a remake of such a great movie could be so utterly bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't say this movie was extremely disappointing because I didn't have any high expectations in the first place, the main reason being that this movie was trying to remake a classic movie that should never have been remade. But that aside you still wouldn't have that good a movie. For one thing the romance isn't believable for a second, and the romance doesn't have that big apart in the first place, so there's not even a chance to develop the romance to make it believable. Another thing is that little facts are given to convince you that the murder really happened, and yet the whole movie you are forced to believe that the murder happened, and the characters never even remotely doubt it, which is another reason the original is better, because in the original the whole movie you don't know if it happened or not, facts are thrown in saying that the murder happened and then others facts are thrown in saying it didn't happen, and that kept suspense building, you wondered if it did happen. Also, in this version the murder is the whole plot, while as in the original other dramas are going on and they would take a break to watch them. This movie also has nonstop cheesy lines and clichés, and movie is neither suspenseful, nor dramatic. As much as I hated this movie I will say that it did have some good acting from Christopher Reeve and Darel Hannah. other then that, I would watch the original instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another needless remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many films have been remade in recent years, and I'm always fascinated as to why. The only justifiable reason that I can see for remaking a film, is if the original had potential, but was in the hands of the wrong director. In the case of 'Rear Window', Alfred Hitchcock's original version was close to perfection. That being the case, why did anyone feel a need to remake it? While sticking to the basic storyline of a man confined to his apartment and becoming suspicious that a neighbour has murdered his wife, there are a few changes. Christopher Reeve plays the lead character, who is not a photographer but an architect, and has been pompously renamed Jason Kemp. Also the lead female role, played by Daryl Hannah, is not his girlfriend (to begin with) but his colleague. And there are some other differences here and there, such as the lack of exploration into the complexities of relationships, and the fact that Jason Kemp has two medical assistants on call 24 hours instead of an insurance nurse that visits daily. I suppose the makers deviated in these areas so that the film would not look like an exact copy of the original, but these differences do very little, and in some cases let the film down.For a thriller, this film hardly manages to mildly scare. Jeff Bleckner's direction does not labour on key points in the film long enough to generate much tension, nor is there much atmosphere. The film's soundtrack also does not help matters. The best part of the film is Christopher Reeve, who does stand out from a cast with little substance. Thelma Ritter's character of an insurance nurse in Alfred Hitchcock's version, has more spark than the two medical assistants in this film put together. Then again, that may be largely due to the relatively shallow script that the actors have to work with.That being said, this was a very needless remake. Not all of Alfred Hitchcock's films were classics, but when it comes to his best films, I don't believe it's possible to improve on them. Apart from this attempt, 'Psycho' has been remade, as well as multiple remakes of 'The 39 Steps'. Let's hope it stops there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was painful to watch! I thought I would be in for a treat when it showed up on a Saturday afternoon on the Lifetime Network. Boy, was I in for a load of crap. The dialog is the worst I've heard in a long time...even worse than most TV movies. The acting was atrocious, the camera angles were amazingly bad and, overall, there was nothing believable about the entire thing. And yeah, hey, I know Reeve is REALLY paralyzed and in a wheelchair but does that mean he should be given rave reviews because he brilliantly plays a paralyzed man? Okay, I feel for the guy...but this is a really bad movie and I'm not going to pretend it's not for sentimental reasons. Thankfully, the movie just ended. And, though I'm grateful, the ending was so off I didn't even know it was the ending....I would have begun a wave through my living room had I known! Why didn't I change the channel?..something about watching a trainwreck...what do they call it...morbid curiosity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less excitement in this version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is many years since I saw Jimmy Stewart in the original "Rear Window" but if my memory serves me right I feel that this re-make for TV comes nowhere near the original. It lacks the terror, the fear, the excitement that the first "Rear Window" brought to the screen. In the first version it was a simple photographer armed with a camera and flashlight, but here we have an architect with computer and digital camera. A photographic studio has now been become a lavish apartment and there is plenty of room for the electronic chair (formerly a simple wheelchair). In the updating I feel that much of the atmosphere has been lost. While I admire Christopher Reeve's attempt to return to the screen in his paralyzed condition, I feel his acting ability is definitely restrained. There is not much response from or interest in the other actors either. The best that can be said is that this film is a therapeutic exercise for Christopher Reeve. I found the result rather dull and lacking the excitement necessary to make up for the immobility and frustration of the central character.</fullReview>

I mean, sure, nobody expected Christopher Reeves, of all people, to top Jimmy Stewart's performance in the original, but pairing him up with Daryl Hannah was a brilliant move right up there with allowing Joel Schumacher near the Batman franchise more than once. The wooden performances are only topped by the flat dialogue and stupid script. There's more suspense in the average washing line than this travesty. If you've got a choice between watching this or the original, then there's no choice at all. In case I haven't been clear enough, avoid this thing at all costs.</fullReview>

We felt his distress, his bitterness, his agony, his vulnerability... And as much as he suffered in silence, he fought for life... His weakness was his endeavors for perseverance... Christopher Reeve (1952-2004) was a superhero in his determination and tenacity... He proved it in being the first Quadriplegic actor on a high-tech wheelchair in a leading role...

		<fullReview>Modern remake of "Rear Window" in which the lead character (Christopher Reeve) is paralyzed and lives in a high-tech home filled with assistive technology.This film gets a lot of criticism because it is not Hitchcock. And yes, that is true. It probably had no chance of matching the original. But viewing it not as a remake but as a film by itself, it is not all that terrible. It was made for TV, but seems to be of a highest quality than that. And you have to admire that someone wanted to give Christopher Reeve a starring role when his ability became so slim.The "hacking" a guy's computer when he's one room over is a little silly, because you know... um... people can hear that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of Hitchcock classic has moments, but it's a pale shadow.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, kudos to Christopher Reeve for pressing ahead with his acting career against incredible odds. The first part of the remake is to make us aware of the trauma of being once active, but now wheelchair bound, and very dependent. The film then glides into the heart of the story. For lack of things to do, Reeves spies on his nieghbors, and he soon thinks the emotional sculptor across the street has killed his wife. As in the original, our hero convinces his girlfriend, nurse, and friend (who happens to be a homicide detective) that murder is just next door. This version is not terribly focused. It's a tale of a crippled man, a plea against domestic violence, and a murder. While Raymond Burr was so compelling in the first film, with his worried teddy bear look, and powerful hands ready to kill James Stewart, this new killer is one dimensional. (He even wears a black t-shirt with a big skull on the chest, so we know he's bad news) His final confrontation with the helpless Reeve is a joke. His long, involved method of trying to kill Reeve makes one think of the long, involved killing methods villians used on Batman and Robin in the old TV series. One of the more frightening moments in the first RW was Grace Kelly snooping in the killer's apartment. The matching scene in the new RW (Now it's a likable Daryl Hannah) has it's moments concerning suspense. Even bound to a wheelchair, and limited to showing emotions, Reeves gives a fine performance. We start to care about his character. I just hope in the future, this always warm actor chooses better screenplays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1954's Rear Window is my favorite movie of all time. I have held off watching this remake for eight years. I just dreaded seeing the classic copied and ruined. It was not as bad as I was anticipating, but it captures none of the charm, humor or suspense of the original. Christopher Reeve is no Jimmy Stewart, and although Darryl Hannah is no Grace Kelly, I did like her performance, it was subtle and sincere. They left so much of the best stuff out of the original and focused instead just on the one neighbor. All the high tech gadgetry is a distraction. It just proves, no one can direct a film as well as the Master himself - Alfred Hitchcock. I would shudder to think of what he would say if he saw this remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As is par for the course with remakes of classic films like Hitchcock's "Rear Window", this made for television effort is not a shadow on the original.This particular re-working has updated the original premise to the modern era, and Christopher Reeve's bed-ridden voyeur is afforded the luxury of video surveillance and computer technology. Although creative in its new adaptation, this is about as good as it gets. Too much time is spent laying the foundations of the plot, and not enough time is left to make it work.Christopher Reeve, it must be said, puts in an amazing effort as the paralysed architect who believes he has witnessed a murder.

		<fullReview>Rear Window (1998) ** (out of 4) After a car accident a man (Christopher Reeve) is left paralyzed and begins killing time by spying on his neighbors when he thinks he hears one of them murdered. There's some interesting aspects to this remake of the Hitchcock classic but at the end of the day there are just way too many problems for the film to really work. Reeve is very good in the part, although it took me some time to get involved with the film because the early scenes of him in rehab and dealing with being paralyzed where rather depressing to watch. Daryl Hannah is wasted in the Grace Kelly role and Robert Forster's roll as the detective is very badly written. It was interesting how the filmmakers used an upscaled apartment for a crippled but the actual murder case is very boring and the ending is a big letdown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When a movie is Reality: a man becomes a Superman (dvd)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even if it's based on a true story, a movie is always a fictive work. So, the cast acts and not live the story (above all, today with all those blue screen sets?). But, sometimes, there are magical exceptions, when a movie transcends its make-believe content to show a truth in all its purity.This is the case here with the exceptional performance of Christopher Reeves: he didn't play the tetraplegic because he WAS tetraplegic.Did people ever wonder what this difficult state implies and all the efforts and dedication Mr. Reeves had to reach for his job. It's a Superman's task. And he delivered it successfully, because his acting of this "strange" watcher was truly convincing. It reminded me of the best moments in the Superman's saga where he was also remarkable? Sure, you will be stunned by the first twenty minutes, especially if Superman was the last time you saw him. It's deeply moving to remember him as the more powerful human. And then, you will be delighted for the next hour, because with his big heart and craftsmanship, you will forget his physical condition to only see the story he had to tell.So, it is a shame that he didn't get the Golden Globe for this role, even if he was nominated. I wonder how the winner could accept the Globe while knowing he was in competition with such an inspired colleague. Fortunately, Mr. Reeves will later win the SAG award.And for those who pay attention to the direction, the director's choice to actually shoot literally the title of the movie (at least, a third of the movie has the rear window for setting) is a good bet.Finally, it is not a movie that you will watch over and over, but it deserves at least ONE TIME and you won't ever forget it (like Mr. Reeves)?.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rear Window</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew this wasn't going be better than the original Sir Alfred Hitchcock/James Stewart version, but it is certainly a good attempt at remaking a classic. Basically architect Jason Kemp (Golden Globe nominated Christopher Reeve) has a car accident, ending with him being paralysed, and after getting out of hospital he is placed in a wheelchair, and back in his large apartment. The only thing he can do to entertain himself, with nothing to do, is spy on his neighbours out of his window. He is regularly visited by work colleague Claudia Henderson (Daryl Hannah), and his nurses Antonio Fredericks (Ruben Santiago-Hudson) and Leila, Jason's Ex-Wife (Anne Twomey), but mostly alone he suspects neighbour Julian Thorpe (Ritchie Coaster), after seeing many arguments, and hearing a scream, that he has killed his wife Ilene (Allison Mackie, also playing her sister). As time goes by, Jason gets himself great technological spying equipment, contacts people with his voice activated technology, and tries to convince who he can of his suspicions, including Detective Charlie Moore (Robert Forster). Towards the end, Julian confronts Jason and attempts to murder him and the nurses, and the film concludes with an almost happy ending, involving an artwork from Thorpe. In terms of modernising, that is certainly a big factor, and Reeve's true paralysis (instead of a broken leg like Stewart) adds more realism and edge to the story, and for one of his last roles before dying in 2004, this was a good one. It was nominated the Emmy for Outstanding Music Composition for a Miniseries or a Movie (Dramatic Underscore) for David Shire. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reeve's best role in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While nobody expected this to be anywhere near as good as Hitchcock's classic, I found the film surprisingly engrossing. Some people might say Reeve didn't stretch his abilities, but I would argue that he still convinced me that he was Jason Kemp. Reeve's character is absolutely helpless, whereas Jimmy Stewart could still use his arms, and this made Reeve's character all the more vulnerable. It made for a more suspenseful, edge-of-your-seat film. I've read that this film was simply a showcase for the gadgets that Reeve uses to live life, but I think that's an unfair criticism of a thoroughly enjoyable, not to mention educational, film.The rest of the cast provides solid support, but it's Reeve's show all the way. I'm glad the accident didn't keep him away from acting. He's always been an underrated actor, except as Superman, so it's good to see a different role provide him with a high profile opportunity to showcase his acting ability.

		<fullReview>I almost missed seeing this movie and I'm glad I didn't. I thought Reeve was excellent; I was surprised by the range of expression and emotion from someone in his condition. He didn't go on any crusades for the handicapped, which was nice. I thought that his character captured the "almost illegal" nature of his peeping that Jimmy Stewart captured in the original. And the paralysis in the bed when he heard the screams as well as the gasping for breath was just the psycho kind of thrill that Hitchcock would have been proud of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a letdown, but certainly a better film than the diabolical remake of "Psycho"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1998 was the year of the Alfred Hitchcock legacy remakes. Three of the master of suspense's most famous motion pictures ("Rear Window" (1954), "Psycho" (1960), and "Dial M for Murder" (1954) were remade in the same year. They gave writing credit to the original story, novel, and play authors that inspired Hitchcock's movies, but they were essentially just remakes, or in the case of one, a copy. Now I saw the 1998 remake of "Rear Window" (1954) within a week of the diabolical copy of "Pyscho" (1960), so my expectations for the remake of the former were immediately lowered and I was frankly expecting another hour and a half of torture. What I got surprised me. I do not recommend the remake of "Rear Window", but I must admit that it exceeded my low expectations and for the first two-thirds of the film, I was enjoying mild entertainment until the third act, when the film shot itself in the foot, fell flat on its face, and did not get back up again.The plot is basically the same as the original 1954 film with a few minor changes to the characters. In the original, the protagonist of the film was a photographer played by James Stewart confined to a wheelchair by an accident. In the remake, the protagonist is a quadriplegic played by real-life quadriplegic Christopher Reeve, who made this movie shortly after his horse-riding accident that left him disabled for the rest of his life. Save for a few other changes, the plot and basic unfolding of the story is the same, with Reeve looking out the window at his neighbors across the courtyard and becoming interested and suspicious when the wife of an abusive man (Ritchie Coaster) disappears mysteriously.First of all, let me hand out my praises to Christopher Reeve for his terrific performance. It was very authentic of the filmmakers to cast Reeve since he was a quadriplegic and Reeve used all that he had and gave us a very sympathetic and likable character. I was also very pleased how in the beginning, the filmmakers used some of their own ideas instead of just flat out borrowing from the original. I also felt the music by David Shire was very good; it reminded me a lot of James Horner's magnificent score from "Braveheart" (1994).Unfortunately, the movie also does have its flaws and when the third act of the film comes into play, that's when it really begins to suffer. For the flaws that existed right from the start, let's begin with the supporting cast. Darryl Hannah gives it her all, but she's just not as compelling as the well-written character played by Grace Kelly in the original. Robert Forster (who was also in the dismal 1998 remake of "Psycho" (1960), plays the detective who's helping the voyeur trying to solve what appears to be a murder case, but he doesn't have the same presence and charisma that came out of the detective played by Wendell Corey in Hitchcock's film. And what I missed most was the presence of a character like the one played by Thelma Ritter. In the original "Rear Window", she was the real light of the show. James Stewart was the star, but Ritter stole every scene she was in. Here, there's no such character. The protagonist's nurse is surprisingly dry and boring and there aren't really any substitutes. I also felt that the editing of this movie was vastly imperfect, with scenes going in and out and fading into and out of one another without any real sense of where it's going and scenes that are supposed to generate suspense and fear don't succeed. And in the final third of the movie, the filmmakers just take it in the wrong direction, play it out badly, and it becomes very standard, very conventional, and not very primal. And it was at this point that I really lost interest, for I felt I'd seen it before a million times, and even if I hadn't, I still doubt I would have been able to stay interested.My bottom line advice is the same for the two other 1998 remakes of Hitchcock's legendary films: rent the original. If you want a truly great mystery/suspense-thriller, stick with the master of suspense in the original "Rear Window" (1954). I definitely recommend seeing that one first and, if you're interested like I was, check out the remake with Christopher Reeve and you may or may not be totally disappointed. Me, I was left feeling a little letdown, but not anywhere near as much I was expecting and this is most certainly a better film that Gus Van Sant's diabolical remake of "Pyscho" (1960).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do they want to remake masterpieces?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea is great since it comes from a master mind of suspense. The main actor is also great because he plays his own role as a crippled victim of a dumb accident. But at the same time something is wrong in the extraordinary exhibitionism of these Americans who do not know what a blind is and who broadcast every single of their sighs to the whole neighborhood through open windows and paper thin walls. It makes the voyeur in this case practically justified since there is no other way but hear and see. But that's too easy. It takes a lot of the secrecy of this voyeuristic knowledge out of the story. The suspense itself is even in many ways reduced, crippled. From a dark and frightening film we shift in this remake to a plain action film with a cripple as the main character who is beautifully rendered by Christopher Reeve, but that is not enough to make a great film. This remake is not really improving, nor even getting close to the original.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine &amp; University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the fade-out transitions (for TV obviously), this was a very good movie. It's a little bit heartbreaking to watch the beginning, though. Christopher Reeve's character was every bit as determined to overcome his paralysis as Reeve himself was, and while I'm sure it was very uplifting back then, it's a bit sad to watch now that he has passed away. I wanted to watch this out of sheer curiosity about Reeve's acting skills post-accident. He was just as good as ever, and a joy to watch as always. Filmography was good, all the supporting characters were good, and there was plenty of suspense too. I would highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having survived a car crash, Jason Kemp is left paralysed from the neck down and his only comfort is the fact that his high paying job has allowed him to have his flat kitted out with loads of assistive technology. Trying to cope with the loss of his body, Jason is determined to stay busy but soon finds himself becoming fascinated with the apartment block across the road from his own flat. He spots a woman across the road getting into a domestic with her boyfriend and call the police on him. Being just as nosey, one of his helpers, Antonio, feeds his interest by getting him a camera and monitor set up. However when the boyfriend comes back something happens and the woman he has been watching seems to no longer be in the flat Jason suspects murder.The term "vanity project" could be applied to this film since it is more about Reeve himself than his character, but in this case it would be a hardhearted person that would attack the film on this ground. The film has a certain amount of novelty value due to the presence of Reeve but outside of that it is hard to ignore how inferior it is to the Hitchcock original. I know some reviewers have been so moved by the presence of Reeve that they have found it difficult to review the film as what it is meant to be ? which is something of value in its own right. As such this remake isn't actually that good because it lacks tension, character and originality. It isn't terrible of course, because it is reasonably engaging but, aside from the novelty value, I can't see why anyone would chose to watch this in place of the original.Reeve is pretty good in the lead role. He is natural enough and convincing in his sense of panic but he is hardly given that great a performance. I can understand why viewers would be sympathetic in their judgement of his performance but perhaps they have been a bit too generous ? it is brave, but not brilliant. Talking of "not brilliant", good to see Darryl Hannah still churning out the wooden performances. Forster is a nice "pre-Jackie Brown" find but doesn't have much to do, while I didn't care for Santiago-Hudson that much.Overall this is a so-so film that benefits greatly from the presence of Reeve. Aside from his return to the screen there isn't a huge amount to make this worth a look ? particularly when it has been done so much better elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie really inspired me because Christopher Reeves got in an accident and that caused him to be paralyzed but that didn't stop him from doing everyday things. At the end of the movie Christopher Reeves falls madly in love with his partner helping him out to solve the case. That right there shows me that anybody weather your disabled or not can do anything if they put their mind to it. Christopher Reeves is a good example for all of us because he shows us that anybody can be anything they want to be. This movie is probably also one of the best movies because it pays to have a cute actor like Christopher Reeves playing the part of the guy who spies on people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is the problem here?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe that so many others on this page have slated this film. Yes, everyone is entitled to an opinion, so let me share mine.I watched this film last night on Channel Five in the UK, and it was excellent. No, the direction wasn't perfect, and the camerawork wasn't all that. Daryl Hannah was a bit wooden, and the relationship between her and Chris Reeve was a bit 'take it or leave it'. But the film, as a TV FILM, not as a remake of a Hitchcock film, worked very well. Reeve's acting was fantastic - a role that didn't (through tragic circumstance) rely on his Superman persona (or ability) and focused on his facial expressions and voice. How many actors can carry a movie with only that? This was a fantastic performance in a difficult role. The suspense was tangible, keeping me on the edge of my seat. It veered away from the original at the end, which wrong-footed me a bit. It took the film into another dimension, if you like. Nothing like the element of surprise. If you CAN'T get past the fact that it's a remake of a Hitchcock film, then let's say that you've seen the original - like me. So what if someone's remade it? Does it mean that the original is destroyed, never to be seen again? Course not. Does it mean that people won't watch the original? No more than if they'd never seen the remake. 'Young' audiences who watch Jimmy Stewart films are not going to turn their noses up at one that happens to have been remade with Christopher Reeve. Why all the criticism? Because someone dared to remake a Hitchcock film? Big deal. Watch the original too. Hitchcock remade his own film - The Man Who Knew Too Much. Problem? Forget all this filmic snobbery - this is a solid thriller with a fantastic performance. Watch it if you get a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course it's very difficult - maybe even some kind of sacrilege - to do a remake of an Alfred Hitchcock film. In my opinion, this 1998 TV remake of "Rear Window" doesn't need to hide behind the original version, as it's well done and shows as a nearly completely paralyzed Christopher Reeves three years after his shocking accident in a very strong performance.Many things appear similar to the original version - Reeves watched the opposite house front and all the different people behind the windows - a gay couple (not featured in the original 1954 version), an attractive single women, a busy author and the villain - this time not a harmlessly-looking and silent older men like in the original, but a violent weirdo artist with an alcohol-addicted girlfriend. He believes to have watched (or heard) a cruel murder and wants to find out the bloody secret that has happened in his neighbor's flat.Reeves gives his performance a more tragical aspect as James Stewart in the fifties version - while Stewart, a well-known sports photographer who is bound to the wheelchair with a broken leg - just does his "job" by watching other people, Reeves is completely paralyzed and can only satisfy his longings for feelings, love and even sex by going to cybersex chat rooms and watching other people's lives and sex through a digital cam.The ending is directed with more suspense than the original version with a long a thrilling showdown between Reeves and the villain. The supporting actors are also very good, with Ritchie Coster and Allison Walkie as killing couple and Robert Forster as cop (funnily, he played in another Hitchcock remake - Psycho - the same year).A good Hitchcock remake and an outstanding TV production with a great Christopher Reeves, which is great fun to watch again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't expect Hitchcock trickery. This film has real power.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lets get one thing straight. Most reviewers have panned this because they say it loses what Hitchcock created. Fair enough, if the film had been trying to emulate Hitchcock. It isn't.After Chris Reeves' accident, there was only ever going to be one role he could ever play again and this was it. How many other movies have wheelchair bound heroes? So for Chris to return to the profession which he loved, this had to be the one. Now I know many people have a love affair with Hitch, but I must admit I never found Rear Window to be a classic like some of his others, the idea came from creating a movie on a single set. The camera never moves out of Jimmy Stewarts room, until he falls out of the window.While this was an interesting excercise and experiment, I find that not even the great Jimmy Stewart can keep his energy up throughout the film. It is as static as the camera.The modern version, although a technical remake with the same basic plot line, is not attempting to do the same thing. First of all it is a showcase for Christopher Reeves. This may sound like a vanity project but it is not. Reeves as Superman was a cult hero but never about to win an Oscar. This is a performance that if you accept it, because it is hard viewing watching him knowing that he is portraying his everyday life, will haunt you. Having lost the use of his body, Reeves shows everything through his face. The part where his air supply is disconnected was done for real, can you imagine performing while your entire life depends on the people around you. Reeves leaves you with no apology for his condition, asking for no sympathy but a simple laying bare of the human soul, his, trapped in a useless body. A sterling feat in a thriller.This is not just about chris or people in his condition, but about all paraplegics and quadriplegics trapped in a shell of a body. By the end, you will know what it is like to live like that, and perhaps you might change your attitude or appreciate what you have, just a little bit more.Other than that, the rest of the cast are decent and the direction is competent, the style is of a TV movie, but its the best TV movie you will see. It's not Hitchcock, it doesn't try to be and it shouldn't be compared to the original. But from Christopher Reeve, who sadly (or perhaps for him, a release), passed away not so long ago, it is the greatest performance of his life and a wonderful epitaph.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Updated version of the 1954 Alfred Hitchcock classic "Rear Window" with Christopher Reeves as quadriplegic Jason Kemp who unknowingly spies upon a violent domestic dispute by his neighbors across the yard that possibly later escalated to murder. Recovering from a car smash-up architect Jason Kemp is left without the use of his arms and legs and very bitter that his latest project was given to fellow architect Claudia Henderson, Daryl Hannah, who took over for him while he was hospitalized.Back home Jason is given all the high-tech equipment to make his life, and in-home work,a lot easier. Even his relations with Claudia starts to warm up when he realizes that she's not trying to upstage him but wants him to be part of the project that she's doing. Jason later falls in love with Claudia who among other thing made his life a lot happier by her concern and attention towards him at this very critical time in his recovery. With nothing to do with his free time Jason watches, with a zoom-video camera, what his neighbors are doing across the back-yard of his apartment building. He then soon notices this couple constantly fighting with each other. Not taking it seriously at first Jason sees that the fights are a lot more intense and violent then your average family squabbles. One evening Jason calls 911 when the husband Julian Thorpe, Richie Coaster, beats his wife Ilene, Allison Mackie, to the point where she almost loses consciousness. The next night after Julian was released from police custody Jason hears a blood-curdling scream coming from the Thorpe apartment then all is deathly quite. Spying on the Thorps the next few day, to see if everything is all right, Jason notices something very strange and disturbing. Ilene is no longer there and Julian is living with another woman, who turned out to be Ilene's sister, who stole or also took over Mrs. Thorpe's identity. Better then average made-for-TV thriller that turned out to be actor Chris Reeves' last, and most personal, movie role. Suspenseful build-up as Thorpe slowly realizes that he's not only being spied on by Jason but that Jason knows what he did to his wife and tries to murder him to keep Jason from going to the police. The ending of "Rear Window" is a bit of a let-down but at the same time more intriguing then that of the 1954 version of the movie by leaving it, the ending,up in the air and to the imagination of the viewers.Chris Reeves was playing himself in the movie "Rear Window" as he was a real victim of a spinal-cord injury, that he suffered from a raiding accident on May 27, 1995, that left him paralyzed for the rest of his life until he passed away just days after his 52th birthday. Christopher Reeves made a much bigger impact on the public in the courage that he showed and energies that he gave in battling the disability that he suffered and making it,the cure for Neurolog Disease, the cause that he fought for until his death. Reeves helped create the Christoper Reeves Paralysis Foundation and thus helping, as well as inspiring, thousands of others suffering from that disabling disease with the hope that advanced medical treatments hopefully will eradicate it in the very near future. Chris showed the public, in the last nine years of his life, that he was just as much the man Superman while confined in a wheelchair in real life as the was the comic book hero Superman that he played in the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inevitably Hitchcock vs Bleckner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe the comment's title is wrong. It's not inevitable to compare 1954's Rear Window with this one, you can enjoy this one without thinking of or even knowing the other; but it is surely most amusing to compare both.First of all we have to notice the diferences between the protagonists in both cases. James Stewart is a man with merely a broken leg, not totally unable to perform physical action while Reeve is a completely disabled man, which causes imediately diferent kinds of scenes. I think none of the actors has a superior acting comparing to the other. They both give their own vision, in opinion both are superb(I just want to bring out the enormous dedication and effort of Christopher Reeve to go on with his career despite the acident. Bravo!).This film is clearly modern, I was pleased to see all the innovations of tecnology in this one, observations, celular phones, the use of email and internet. We feel this is a movie of our times.In terms of the film's action, I think the scene in which the killer gets in the house of the main character is stronger and more powerful in this one than in Hitchcock's, though the scene of the woman in the killer's house being caught is much much better in the original, this one is not half as thrilling. And apart from these generaly speaking Hitchcock' version keeps you mor close to the screen (or wasn't Hitchcock the almost absolute master of suspense...). But this is just worth as an opinion. Some may desagree. What I think makes the old film far superior from this is the paralell stories which this one hardly have. In the older one there were lots of other stories with other characters (Miss Lonely Heart, Miss Torso, the composer...) while the new one sticks almost only to the main action. Bad choice, very bad in my opinion. Other stories were juicy and worth analysis. The only advantage of this one is that it concentrates attetion on the crime, even though it may cause eventually some tediouness. Also to notice the slightly different ending.Still this one is worth being watched on its own, as the independent and good thriller it is. Rent it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first, I asked myself, "How on Earth will Reeve act with so many things wrong with him?" Then I thought, "I have no hands, I can do anything I put my mind to it and so can any other disabled human being here on Earth." The next night, I saw Rear Window. It was truly the best T.V. movie I have ever seen in recent years. Most movies are about extramarital affairs, cancer, Aids, and movies that mostly can be seen in soap operas. Rear Window is a masterpiece compared to those other movies. The actors, Daryl Hannah &amp; Christopher Reeve &amp; Robert Forester are not from any series on T.V. (which most T.V. movies have nowadays), that was a BIG plus for me. The production, the scenes &amp; the plot were up to date &amp; right on target. And, for the most part, I knew Christopher Reeve could do this, but what he did last night in Rear Window was very VERY VERY inspiring to me and when it comes on again, I hope many of you will watch it because it is an amazing movie with an inspiring man, Christopher Reeve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen the original Hitchcock version of this movie, but it couldn't have been better than this. This was a very wonderful movie, keeping me on the edge of my seat. Christopher Reeves performance was only accentuated by the fact that he really is confined to his wheelchair and that many of the problems he faced in his everyday life are true problems. His co-stars worked with him very well and it was all in all an incredible experience. There were plenty of scenes where I could literally feel my heart pounding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! Even though Christopher Reeve is disabled he can still act. I've haven't seen the orginal and I don't want to. The first time it was on Channel 5, here in England, I saw it in the T.V. magazine, read the plot and thought "sounds like a good movie, so I'll watch". I watched it and at the end I didn't think it was good, I thought it was totally, utterly BRILLIANT. So, Last week I was reading through the T.V. mag and saw it listed on channel 5and thought "yes, I'm taping that". So, now me and my step-brother own two of three of the greatest T.V. Movies I ever seen, the other two being Mr. Murder and Atomic Train. I recommend it.******</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A TV Movie Masterpiece, "Superman" actor is amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the original movie two months ago in History of Film, but I fell asleep through it! It was stupid! This movie had me on the edge of my seat, and I recorded it commercial free! Christopher Reeve's return to acting was awesome, and he delivered one of his best performances ever! When I was a little kid, he was my favorite movie star, because he was the best Superman ever! Way to go Christopher, and I pray for you and others that you will someday walk again!</fullReview>
