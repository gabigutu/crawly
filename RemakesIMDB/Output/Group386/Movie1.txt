		<shortDescription>A great seminal early gangster film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sadly this film was made available long years (like 50) after the giants of the early gangster films were available---Little Cesear and The Public Enemy,so it missed the true acclaim it probably deserves.Being made during Prohibition, and during the less "glamourous" studio period (but with an excellent director, fast paced script and great supporting cast) it has the immediate feel of the time---when the policeman hero is exiled to the country it IS the country, and the character actors shine here--especially the incandescent and tragic Marie Prevost as the platinum blonde chanteuse, Helen Hayes. She is absolutely wonderful as a complete jazz baby flinging herself into the arms of the nearest well heeled heel available, her desperation clearly visible under the surface. This performance is subtle in it's (Mae West) undertones, but she anticipates the bright gaudy generous hearted vulgarity of Jean Harlow by several years. She has a huge range with her hideous fox fur collared cape, her cigarette, and her bits of business with her props--she has the stage presence of her character's name Helen Hayes, but she is much more naughty and fun to watch. She cynically analyzes the lead villain's fear of women, and stands up to him, leveraging his fear in the face of his men, and lays her neck on the line. At the same time, she desperately digs for gold, playing hard to get with the gangster's weak spot, his younger, ratty brother. (George Stone in an early role). The scene where she rips off her "act" costume, and jumps on an upright piano and has the musician's wheel her over to the gangster's brother's "birthday party" is pure gold.How sad that she died so horribly in real life, but how wonderful that her performance is preserved here in all it's splendor! While Thomas Meighan is the same noble stiff as a board hero of DeMille's society matrons movies of the l920s he also shows range in a "good cop" role with a noir twist at the end, making this one of the first contemporary gangster movies. George E Stone, who would go on to play everyone's favorite rat for the next 40 years is here in a juvenile lead, scummy and detestible as ever, and the perpetually bombed and wisecracking reporter Skeets Gallegar gets all the fast paced and best lines. God Bless Ted Turner for not letting this one get lost! Cannot wait for it to come out on DVD for all true noir and gangster film archaeologist's to enjoy! We can only wonder what a kick it would be in film histories of today if this had been available at the same time as The Public Enemy , Little Ceasar and other seminal works. If you are a "Merry Gangster Historian" go for it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great directing of a very good cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lewis Milestone performed one of his best directing jobs with "The Racket." He had a superior cast in what, in a later talkie, might be just a mediocre script, but taken in context, "The Racket" is a great movie. Watch the byplay during the funeral, for example. Milestone and his editors and special effects people create some excellent visual effects to complement a cast that charms even in the role of slimy bad guy. Minor characters still got their chances to shine in the spotlight and even the non-speaking -- well, of course all the characters were non-speaking in one sense -- the un-named characters whose job was to look menacing or even just interested in the goings-on, all stood out.Frankly this film was a surprise to me -- not that it was so good, but that I had had no knowledge of it beforehand. To come so early in the career of so many of the people connected with it, notably Howard Hughes, who had the (to me) strange title of "presenter," this film is a stand-out. Robert Israel, who wrote the music for this revival, is fast becoming one of the great composers of the modern era. All the people who are responsible for this film's recent revival deserve the thanks of film lovers as well as film historians. "The Racket" is one to see again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful rescued film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has been resurrected courtesy of Turner Classic Movies, the University of Nevada, et al. (in pretty good shape, too) in a nicely done digital restoration, complete with a good score. If you get a chance to see it, you might want to take a chance: in spite of it being a silent (I consider that a handicap), it's an entertaining film, with a lot to like.There's fine acting, especially by Louis Wolheim as the main gangster, whose face is so expressive you don't miss the sound as long as he's on screen. Marie Prevost and 'Skeets' Gallagher turn in solid supporting performances. There's clever dialogue: very good given the constraints silent films inherently have.Personally, I thought the best feature is the wonderful cinematography. Rarely does the camera technique look dated or technically primitive, and many scenes are as well done as any since. The use of dissolves and interesting angles was delightful, and there are even a couple (surprising, to me) attempts at zooms that come off alright. Obviously a good director/cinematographer team. The overall look of the film is fresh and clear.The story is pretty entertaining and the characters are brought to life, making me glad this film was brought back to life as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Silent Crime Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this a very enjoyable early crime drama. Students of the genre will want to compare this to "Little Caesar" and/or "The Front Page". Transitions within scenes and from one scene to another flow better in "The Racket" than in many other silent films.I agree with earlier comments about the new scoring. There is too much brass and too much forte.The film itself is about 83 minutes long, much longer than we thought during the 76 years that it was out of circulation. The restoration job on the film is one of the best that I have seen, especially for a film as old as this one is. I hope it is released soon on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am watching it right now on TCM. It has been digitally restored and a new soundtrack added. The music is excellent. I was sure it was 'period' until I saw the credits, which are rolling as I type.Marie Prevost is amazing, she dominates every scene in which she appears. Her expressions and body language are astounding. It helps you understand what silent movie acting is all about.This was a Howard Hughes production. I believe the picture is longer than 60 minutes, though.The University of Nevada at Las Vegas is credited with this restoration project. They did a great job. I love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prototypical gangster epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like TWO ARABIAN KNIGHTS and THE MATING CALL, this film has now been restored by UNLV (which found the prints of these films once thought lost in an archive of producer Howard Hughes' possessions) in cooperation with Flicker Alley.Lewis Milestone, who had just directed TWO ARABIAN KNIGHTS for Hughes, brought much of the same sense of friendly rivalry between the two leads to this picture, as well as the same co-star, Louis Wolheim. All the elements of many a subsequent gangster picture are here: The close personal relationship between the antagonists (gang boss Wolheim and cop Thomas Meighan); the kid brother whom the gangster wants to shelter from the rackets (George E. Stone, soon to appear in LITTLE CAESAR and many another gangster flick), but who runs afoul of a tough little chanteuse (Marie Prevost). Mob bosses cavorting in lavish nightclubs, overwrought gangland funerals, crooked politicians, a wet-behind-the-ears reporter with two old pros as a chorus: it's all here. Enough of the action takes place in a run-down precinct house to belie the story's stage origins, but there's plenty of action, including a shootout between two rival gangs, to keep things hopping.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Milestone Gangster Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tough cop Thomas Meighan (as James McQuigg) versus underworld kingpin Louis Wolheim (as Nick Scarsi). In a subplot, blonde gold-digger Marie Prevost (as Helen Hayes) pursues Mr. Wolheim's "bad boy" brother George Stone (as Joe Scarsi). This Howard Hughes piloted film was considered for "Best Production" at the first Academy Awards, as "the most outstanding motion picture considering all elements that contribute to a picture's greatness." Although it understandably lost to "Wings", it does posses elements of "greatness".Mr. Meighan, one of the biggest and most beloved stars of the era, brings considerable presence to his role; with a script that offers him surprisingly few opportunities for characterization. Wolheim and director Lewis Milestone are always a fun to watch match. Ms. Prevost and the supporting cast do their best with the "love story" and gangland activities. And, the production values are high. If only more focus and characterization were on the personal stories and conflicts concerning McQuigg and Scarsi! Curiously hesitant to show much depth; still, "The Racket" exposes, while inadvertently glamorizing, the gangster lifestyle.******* The Racket (6/30/28) Lewis Milestone ~ Thomas Meighan, Louis Wolheim, Marie Prevost</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As it has just been recovered and digitized by University of Nevada at Las Vegas and Turner Classic Movies along with the rest of Howard Hughes' classic silent movies, the people of today will finally get to see this great movie. A movie about prohibition and the mafia, made at the same time it was all going on. Idealizing the mafia before the Godfather was even thought of. Although it may be silent, it shows detail on the corruption of the mob with the police force and government officials, and not to mention the costumes of the film were obviously fitting for the time period, and used common "gangster" themes, such as the pinstriped suit with fedora and the cigar. The production quality is very good for the time, with what equipment they had to work with. The stereotypical choppiness of the frames from 20's movies rarely occurs, except when there is much fast action. Turner also did a good job digitizing this, as the film quality is still high. I recommend that people see this, albeit short, it gives a good idea about the movies of the times. Along with "Two Arabian Nights", also produced by Howard Hughes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tad Too Early</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Racket proved me wrong about a certain assumption I had always maintained that gangster films came really alive once sound came in because the snappy dialog of a Cagney, Bogart, or Robinson film was integral to the success. This film could hold its own with any of the sound films of the genre.It originated on Broadway as a three act play all taking place in a police station that is captained by Thomas Meighan who is a doggedly honest cop in a city that is systemically corrupt. It's gotten real personal between Meighan and gangland boss Louis Wolheim. Wolheim is a swaggering arrogant sort who's even got his superiors out of joint with him for his quick resort to violence. Wolheim is a misanthropic sort who does not like women, no gangster molls for him. He has a weakness though, his spoiled rotten younger brother George E. Stone who has fallen big time for torch singing Marie Prevost. All that brings Wolheim down eventually.Seeing Prevost on top of an upright piano she is obviously basing her character on Helen Morgan. The Racket came to the screen a tad too early, some musical numbers would have been good and might have happened if the film had been done even a few months later. Maybe even Morgan herself might have done the part.As for Meighan his character is clearly based on Lewis J. Valentine who was a model captain who during the Roaring Twenties maintained his honesty in a corrupt era. Eventually Fiorello LaGuardia made him New York City's police commissioner and he was probably the best that ever filled that job. But that was in the future.Howard Hughes produced this for Paramount and when he took over RKO he remade it with Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan, and Lizabeth Scott. It's a film that I like very much so it was a double treat for me to see this version of the same story. I'd recommend seeing both back to back.And The Racket was up for an Oscar for Best Picture in the year of the first ceremonies. It lost to another Paramount film Wings.The Racket proves that silent films could make good gangster films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's All the Racket About This First-Year Best Picture Nominee? Plenty....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've read some of my other comments, you'll know that I'm in the middle of watching all movies that received Academy Award nominations in the Academy's very first year, 1927-28. "The Racket" was one of three nominees for Best Picture, along with "Seventh Heaven" and "Wings," and though it's by far the least ambitious and "important" of the three, it's the one that I found to be most satisfying.It's a quick, speedy little gangster thriller from Lewis Milestone about one committed cop's determination to see a crime lord brought to justice. It was based on a play, but Milestone does a terrific job of keeping things cinematic -- this movie moves, and that plus the fact that it's not long to begin with makes its running time go racing by.Thomas Meighan, who apparently was a big name at the time but who is unfamiliar to me, plays the cop, while Louis Wolheim plays the gangster. Both are terrific, but both are upstaged, as is everyone else, by Marie Prevost (playing a character named, of all things, Helen Hayes) as surely one of the first memorable gangster molls. She gets a really good pre-Code line (if silent films can be said to have lines) about babies and storks that gives you one of those "could they really say things like that back then" moments that pre-Code movies always have.As far as I know, this movie isn't available anywhere for legitimate viewing. I had to see it the same way I saw "Wings," by watching it in pieces on a site whose name I won't mention. Better catch it soon before someone takes it down.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE RACKET (Lewis Milestone, 1928) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this in anticipation of Josef von Sternberg's UNDERWORLD (1927), a film that revolutionized the gangster genre ? which THE RACKET is as well (I am already familiar with its 1951 remake from the same producer, Howard Hughes). Playwright Bartlett Cormack helped adapt his own work to the screen; interestingly, the chief hoodlum during the original theatrical run was essayed by Edward G. Robinson ? who would achieve movie stardom with a similar role in LITTLE CAESAR (1930)!Though the original was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, ultimately, I still think that the later version is superior (even if nominal director John Cromwell ended up getting replaced by Nicholas Ray!) ? principally because there the antagonistic relationship at its core was formidably filled by Roberts Mitchum and Ryan! In this version, we have forgotten star Thomas Meighan as the quintessential (albeit over-age) Irish cop and burly but suitably smarmy Louis Wolheim (who would re-unite with director Milestone for his Oscar-winning masterpiece ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT [1930]). From what I can recall, the plot is pretty much identical between the two versions (for the record, I own Warner's SE DVD of the 1951 movie, while the earlier one was restored for DVD release by Silent-movie specialists Flicker Alley but it somehow never hit stores!): the gangster not only muscles in on a rival (the entire mob's come-uppance in a speak-easy, during a party thrown in honor of Wolheim's younger brother no less, is superbly realized by Milestone) but even seems to have authority figures under his thumb (recalling in this way the recently-viewed THE GLASS KEY [1935], down to a car-accident-turned-murder-rap which sends a ripple through the already murky waters) ? so that, no matter what he or his associates do, they are sure to get away scott-free! In both, there is also a girl ? pretty but spirited Marie Prevost in 1928, sultry-yet-dull Lizabeth Scott in 1951 ? who first gets embroiled in the villain's schemes and, then, becomes a pawn in the protagonists' struggle for supremacy (which sees Meighan transferred to a precinct far removed from the center of activities and Wolheim tripping himself up by personally exacting revenge upon the cop who arrested his sibling). On the side-lines are a trio of reporters, two vaguely comical (though their antics only seem to exacerbate the feud between policeman and criminal!) and the other a rookie (who becomes involved with Prevost, and is actually the one to bring the villain to book) ? his eventual demise, then, emerges to be heavily tinged with irony!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doctor, I hear gangsters in my head!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While reading all the dialogue of this silent film I found myself coming up with different accents for all the tough mugs inside my head. I couldn't help but act out the film myself using all the cliché gangster voices I've heard before in talkies. It's a nice way to engage with a film that got lost when sound came in. Other than that it wasn't terribly engaging, the story was a little convoluted and the focus was too much on the good honest cop and not enough on the gangsters. Louis Wolheim who plays the head mobster has a look that is so distinctive it seems he inadvertently became the model for the gangster caricatures in every cartoon that's been made since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie with an honest view of corruption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a Thomas Meighan movie. Depending on your age, he was the Clark Gable or George Clooney of the Twenties in America. He plays an honest police captain (McQuigg) against the excellent Louis Wolheim's Nick Scarsi, a mobster bootlegger during Prohibition. Marie Prevost plays Helen Hayes, which caused me confusion when I was trying to read the credits. Hayes is a gold digger with a heart of gold.The gist of the movie is that Scarsi has bought off all the politicians in Chicago; you can't get elected unless Scarsi has all his wards vote for you. So all his men get sprung the night they're arrested by the honest Captain McQuigg. His lawyer has pre-printed writs signed by a judge; the hoodlum gets arrested, the lawyer drops by the jail in a few minutes, and the hood walks. And with the judges and district attorneys in on the corruption, nobody ever gets charged and tried.This is not a great movie, but its treatment of the corruption is remarkably unheroic. McQuigg knows what's going on, and he takes it in good humor. Scarsi and he know each other fairly well on a professional basis and enjoy a humorous scene or two without any acrimony. Scarsi invites McQuigg to his kid brother's birthday party at a speakeasy. McQuigg not only comes but enjoys a champagne toast to the kid. When a thug he's arrested that night shows up at the party when he should be in jail, our captain of police makes a joke at his own expense.All of the actors are competent, the script is good, and the ensemble acting is very good. The casting is excellent - the bad guys are the smaller hoods in the mob, and those roles are filled by smarmy-looking actors who play the parts of men who think they're good looking and almost are but who fall into sneering loutishness. The Hayes character gives some good chuckles with her treatment of the various men trying to put the make on her.Meighan and Wolheim play fully developed characters both of whom are good and bad, with self-deprecation and wit. It's quite different from the talkies gangster movies where it's all black and white, so to speak. In "The Racket," the shades of gray are more pronounced, with our honest cop stepping over the line occasionally to make a bust and make it stick. Although Scarsi is definitely a bad guy, the movie works much better when there are some redeeming features in the villain that make his downfall just but also bittersweet.Marie Prevost was a successful silent actress. She was cast by Ernst Lubitsch in several of his films, earning his praise and the attention of Howard Hughes, who cast her in "The Racket." Her Canadian accent was deemed too unattractive to American audiences for her to succeed in talkies, and she died at the age of 38 from a multitude of ills, including a poor diet and alcohol</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only Howard Hughes could have pulled off something as subversive as the racket. It contains (as far as I can tell) the first reference of cocaine use in any American film. The casting is perfect. From the broken-nosed tough to the dangerously sexy gun-moll, you'd be hard pressed to find a better team of hard-boiled noir players. The film is filled with exotic images. The woman with a face on the top of her hat. The violin with a trumpet horn attached to it. The Hollywood establishment would have never made this film.Like Vampyr, which was made in Germany with independent money in 1932, the film is pregnant with the artistic audacity that only non-Hollywood money can bring into a production. The Racket is worth the search. If you like the gangster genre, you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Racket Is Well Worth The Wait</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The silent film version of The Racket is famous or infamous for a variety of reasons. This stalwart cop vs. Chicago gangland boss film predated the great Warner Brothers films of the 1930s with Edward G. Robinson, James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart, George Raft, and Pat O'Brien, and it created somewhat of a formula for these sort of films. Thomas Meigham plays the self-determined cop, who isn't exactly always operating on the up and up. Louis Wolheim is Nick Scarsi, Chicago gangland boss obviously modeled after one Alphonse Capone, who doesn't care who he has to steamroll over to get his way. Marie Prevost is Helen Hayes, the prototype for Jean Harlow and her ilk in these films for the next decade. She has it all: Dumb blonde on the outside, smart cookie on the inside, and enough sensuality to mix up any guy's thoughts. The film has a great opening sequence reminiscent of film noir with its camera angles, lighting and tracking shots. The first half of the film moves quickly and is well-edited. The second half degenerates into staginess and cheap looking sets, perhaps showing the downside of its theatrical origins. It's based on a Bartlett Cormack play, which originally starred Edward G. Robinson himself on Broadway. The play was only moderately successful, but the film was a best picture nominee directed by Lewis Milestone. Howard Hughes produced the film, which was painstakingly restored after disappearing for more than 50 years (complete with a brand new musical score especially written for its restoration). It's often cited as an influence on film noir or considered a noir film itself, but except for the opening sequence, the film resembles noir only in content and not style. The film does hold up after 80 years now, and it's still an entertaining precursor of a genre that's largely gone today. Look fast for a young Walter Brennan in the first ten minutes. *** of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Louis Wolheim - A Real Hard Guy!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another night, another shootout between tough Nick Scarsi (Louis Wolheim) and Spike, rival bootleggers. Between them is Police Captain McQuigg (Thomas Meighan) who is fighting a losing battle trying to get Scarsi and his gang arrested because Scarsi has all of city hall on his payroll. When McQuigg interferes with Scarsi once too often he is transferred to 28th Precinct - most of his co-workers don't even know where the station house is!!! But this sleepy station is due for a shake up!!Nick's little brother Joe (George E. Stone, he of "Little Caesar" and "42nd Street" fame) is involved with cute club singer Helen Hayes (Marie Prevost) - Nick calls her a "dirty little gold-digger, she responds in the usual way "Well, I'm going to dig and dig deep"!!! One night they get into a fight on the road, Helen gets out of the car, hails down a passing policeman and they both witness Joe running down and killing a woman crossing the road. Surprise! Surprise! - it all happens at the 28th Precinct where the rest of the movie takes place. McQuigg feels this is all he needs to finally put Scarsi where he belongs - behind bars - but as usual Scarsi's wiley lawyer drops in with bail money to release young Joe. The bail doesn't extend to Helen who is left to stew in the cells plotting revenge and getting very friendly with a "wet behind the ears" reporter.Along for the ride is Miller ("Skeets" Gallagher), a young reporter who drinks too much, reads the "American Mercury" and is the 28th Precinct reporter, waiting on the edge of his chair for something to happen. If you are familiar with Gallagher's "talkie" personality, he obviously bought that persona from the silents - he has the same mannerisms, facial expressions, even the same wisecracks via titles. Of course the movie is dominated by it's two male protagonists. Thomas Meighan had been Paramount's biggest star during the 1920s, although he doesn't have the cult status stars like John Gilbert have. In the 20s movie going audiences were older and they liked quiet, dependable, more mature leading men. He was great as Police Captain McQuigg - the strong, silent type!!What can you say about Louis Wolheim - once seen never forgotten. His emotional scene at the end when he claims "If I go down, I'm gonna rip this town wide open" packs a huge wallop. Interestingly, a Dan Wolheim, who must have been a relative, plays the policeman who finally stops him in his tracks. Louis's "ugly mug" hid an intelligent man, who spoke several languages and was a maths teacher until Lionel Barrymore advised him "With a face like yours, you could make a fortune in the theatre"!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent early gangster movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent cast and directing make The Racket a must see for the Silent Movie fan and fans of gangster movies in general. Starring Thomas Meighan as Capt. McQuigg, a no-nonsense police officer in Chicago who does not back down from the Mafia's "Big Boss" Nick Scarsi (played by Louis Wolheim).Nick Scarsi is the leader of the Chicago Mob who has every politician and judge in his hip pocket, and in return for fixing the local election, Scarsi is apparently immune from the long-arm of the law, much to the chagrin of Capt. McQuigg.However, it is a woman named Helen Hayes(played by the beautiful Marie Prevost) that is the undoing of Scarsi, whom refers to women as "poison" several time throughout the film. Helen proved to be the final dose of poison for this underworld boss as she gets him to admit to the killing of a couple of people in front of Capt. McQuigg and the District Attorney.The acting and storyline of The Racket is excellent, and the cast brings believability and conviction to the characters they play.</fullReview>

The end result is a movie with a storyline that seems complicated and convoluted.I was able to follow most of the movie until Police Captain James McQuigg, who is trying to bring down mobster Nick Scarsi, executes a plan involving two newspaper reporters, Scarsi's younger brother, a gold digger, an upcoming election and Scarsi's own organisation. Needless to say, I lost interest in trying to follow this plan and waited for the mobster to be caught.This movie was nominated for Best Picture and I can only think that the Academy members must have thought a storyline involving corrupt politicians and judges is worthy of a nomination.

		<shortDescription>A rather "talky" silent film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is highly reminiscent of the gangster films made by Warner Brothers throughout the 1930s, though oddly it has less action and more talking--a strange thing indeed for a silent film! While you might expect lots of shootouts and action, most of the film is confined to a police station and it unfolds an awful lot like a play. This isn't necessarily bad--the film still earned a score of 7. But if it had featured a little more action, I frankly think it would have been a better film. Still, the plot involving a dedicated police captain who is frustrated by his own corrupt city hall makes an interesting film. Unfortunately, on occasion, the corruptness of the administration is a bit over-the-top. For example, no town, no matter HOW corrupt, would have crooked judges who issue release orders (writs of habeas corpus) the second the crime is committed or before the person is even charged--especially when it appears they will be up on murder charges!! Despite this and it's talkiness, it's still a decent film with an exceptional print through most of the film--though in a few tiny spots it is scratchy and appears in need of further restoration.By the way, the character of "Chick" looks a lot like Paul Rubens ("Peewee Herman"). I found this pretty amusing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stagey early crime melodrama done in by stiffness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am one of the nay sayers, I'm afraid. Everyone else who has left a comment on this film loved it, it seems. I thought the first half hour or so went very well as this segment contained scenes that opened out the stage play, but the final hour, which is pretty much confined to one precinct house and two sets, is very stagy, very stiff and for me, very dull.I am surprised that the other early crime melodrama of that time period, UNDERWORLD, which was far more interesting and cinematic, didn't cop the Best Film Oscar nom - it did get an Oscar for writing, so I guess it was the voters' way of being fair and divvying up the spoils, but THE RACKET is no way near as good a film as UNDERWORLD.Walter Brennan's one scene occurs about ten minutes into the film, George Stone's mug as Joe Scarci is almost as homely as Louis Wolheim, who plays lead heavy Nick Scarsi. At least they match as brothers in central casting.Meighan is wooden as the idealistic cop. Lucien Prival as Chick reminded me of Pee Wee Herman. I'm glad it was rescued from oblivion, but I for one am not one to think this a great film by any means.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>overly talky silent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't love this film, despite the praise it has received over the years. The primary problem is too many title cards and not enough action, too many interconnections in a network of urban corruption and not enough focus on the main characters which are Louis Wohlheim as a crime kingpin, his younger brother (George E. Stone, who is no more believable as a brother of Wohlheim than John Gilbert was a few years later in Gentleman's Fate), and Thomas Meighan as the straight-arrow police officer in opposition to them. Having been directed by Lewis Milestone, there are plenty of interesting camera angles and revelatory dissolves throughout to keep the audience from nodding off. But the outstanding attraction is the vivacious Marie Prevost before she started gaining weight and playing comic relief supporting roles in early talkies. She is the epitome of a tough but warmhearted Prohibition-era flapper. Robert Israel's score leans toward the fake, by-the-book "1920's" sound which seems to be winking at the audience. A more generally suspenseful approach might have worked better, saving the boringly played doo-wacky-doo stuff for the nightclub scenes.</fullReview>
