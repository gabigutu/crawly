		<shortDescription>Nasty Robert Ryan Elevates This Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A deep cast of well-known actors highlights this film noir effort. Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan, Lizabeth Scott, William Talman, Ray Collins, Don Porter and William Conrad are all familiar names, especially to film noir buffs.Ryan lifts this from an average classic-era crime film to above-average with a convincingly nasty character. He plays a no-compromise hood who lives by the code of violence. You have a problem? Violence, not brains, is the answer, according to Ryan's character "Nick Scanlon."The film is fast-moving despite not having a lot of action scenes. All the characters are good, not just Ryan's, and the dialog is excellent in spots. The photography is nothing special, at least not as dramatic as most noirs, but it's a solid crime film, thanks to this cast. I would rate this a bit higher but I didn't care for the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Updating of a Prohibition era play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Racket was originally a play on Broadway which ran for 119 performances in the 1927-1928 season and was later made into a silent film by Howard Hughes. Come 1951 and the Kefauver Senate Rackets Committee hearings in full swing, the gangster film was having a renaissance. So Hughes dusted off this old chestnut and updated it to post World War II America and gave it to his most reliable star at RKO.Robert Mitchum, though cast against type, does well as the upright police captain. I believe his character is based on a man named Lewis J. Valentine who was a well known police captain in New York in the Hylan-Walker era. Valentine was assigned to something called The Confidential Squad which delved into organized crime. Valentine like Captain McQuigg in The Racket, stepped on a lot of toes and got transferred to garbage assignments. Ultimately he was vindicated when Fiorello LaGuardia became mayor, he made Valentine first the Chief of Uniform Patrol and later Police Commissioner. He probably was the best that ever held that job in New York City.Robert Ryan is at his snarling best as old time gangster Nick Scanlon. Ryan is a man behind the times, the syndicate is looking for less public methods to enforce it's will and Ryan is constantly bumping up against them. Interestingly enough, problems are not solved here. McQuigg keeps his precinct clean, but the corruption is shown to be quite systemic. A very groundbreaking attitude for that era.Though The Racket met with a great deal of criticism by reviewers as being old fashioned, I rather like it and would classify it as one of the better products coming out of RKO during the Hughes era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent and gritty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film reminds me a lot of an earlier film that paired Robert Mitchum and Robert Ryan (CROSSFIRE), as both have very tough and gritty plots that are excellent examples of Film Noir. However, in this film instead of a plot involving anti-semitism, it's a good cop versus organized crime flick. Once again, Ryan is a scumbag and Mitchum is a decent and hard-as-nails cop bent on justice. A particular standout is the dialog between them--very snappy and pure Noir! I particularly liked the exchanges between them in the police station when they were cross-examining the cocky and unrepentant Ryan. And, since it is Noir, you know that there will be ample quantities of violence and testosterone. Give it a try--this is a seldom-mentioned classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Run of the mill crime caper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A competent crime movie, enlivened by two strong lead performances from Mitchum and Ryan. The latter has the more interesting part as the gangster who ultimately finds himself friendless when those loyal to him decide he has become too much of a liability. Although the political machinations behind the scenes are dealt with more predominantly than many of the film's contemporaries, much of the satire is lost due to the 'other-worldliness' of the setting. Time and place are never specified, so we are more entangled in the personalities than the bigger moral implications.A slight, but entertaining example of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Corrupted City</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In New York, corruption has reached all levels under the command of the powerful mobster lord "The Old Man" and the local crime boss Nick Scanlon (Robert Ryan). When the Crime Commission under the command of Chief Investigator Harry Craig (Les Tremayne) meets with governor, the disbelief of the population is almost total. Craig tells that the uncorrupted Captain Thomas McQuigg (Robert Mitchum) was moved to the 7th District Police Station and has the intention to clean his district. The Commission counts on the testimony of Roy Higgins (Howland Chamberlain) but Nick sends one of his men to eliminate him. McQuigg uses his honest Officer Bob Johnson (William Talman) to arrest Nick's brother Joe Scanlon (Brett King) and his lover and singer Irene Hayes (Lizabeth Scott) to press Nick, under the protest of the corrupt District Attorney Mortimer X. Welsh (Ray Collins), who is supported by the mafia to the position of judge on the next elections. When Nick kills Bob, he sees the collapse of his empire and the end of the support of "The Old Man"."The Racket" is a good but dated police story disclosing corruption in all levels of New York City. The ending is extremely commercial, moralist and without credibility, with the subpoenas of Mortimer Welsh and Detective Sergeant Turk and the romance between Irene Hayes and the naive City Press journalist Dave Ames. Robert Ryan is excellent in the role of the violent and old-fashioned criminal, but Robert Mitchum has a bureaucratic performance. Just as a curiosity, the name of the owner of the car used by Joe stamped on the newspaper is William R. Wyler, maybe in a tribute to the great director. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "A Estrada dos Homens Sem Lei" ("The Road of the Men Without Law")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Racket-No Foul Ball Here ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Entertaining film with politics, crime and corruption the main themes here.Robert Mitchum plays a dedicated, righteous policeman who heads a unit of officers. He is as honest as 24 hours in a day. He takes pride in such officers as Bill Talman, a young cop gunned down in police headquarters by the usually evil Robert Ryan. Without the insanity of his earlier crime driven roles, Ryan comes across as the embodiment of evil.Ray Collins steals the show as a worm of a prosecuting attorney up to his neck in corruption. It is interesting to note that both Collins and Talman went on to TV careers in "Perry Mason."Lizabeth Scott, as a lounge singer, caught up in the mayhem, tries hard to please but she does not evoke the emotion needed for her role.To say that the ending is justified is more than right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The syndicate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, as some other contributors have already pointed out, belongs to the gangster movie genre. This is not a film noir as IMDb and some other comments suggest. Sure, there are elements of it, but it clearly strays from the basic concept of the noir, as we know it."The Racket" originated in the theater. In fact, John Cromwell, its director, appeared on the original production on the stage. Mr. Cromwell, who is credited with the direction, was in fact, fired by Howard Hughes for differences in the original concept. Nicholas Ray was engaged to re-shoot some scenes that were then edited in what Cromwell had already shot before. One can see the different styles and that's why this film doesn't have a satisfying effect on the viewer. In spite of what William Wister Haines and W. R. Burnett fine screen play, and excellent work by the two leading actors, we are still left hungry for more.Robert Mitchum who plays against type as the courageous Capt. Tom McQuigg, gives a great performance as the uncompromising police chief who believe in doing the right thing. Robert Ryan is also seen in one of his tough appearances as the head of the local gang, Nick Scanlon. Lizabeth Scott doesn't have a great chance to shine in the film since her character stays outside of the action most of the time. William Talman, Ray Collins, William Conrad, Don Porter, are seen in supporting roles.John Cromwell had an eye for showing Los Angeles in all its splendor worked wonders with his cinematographer, George Diskant in this black and white film that although flawed, still shows its edge after more than fifty years since it went into production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably of most interest to fans of Robert Ryan and Robert Mitchum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Racket, no noir just a big city crime story, is as predictable as a fig newton. Still, in some ways the movie as like finding out at first bite that your fig newton is made with pumpkin. Captain Tom McQuigg (Robert Mitchum) is a big, tough cop in charge of a go-nowhere precinct. He's been bounced from precinct to precinct, not because he's a failure but because he's honest. His city is filled with corruption, vice, the numbers...you name it. Nick Scanlon (Robert Ryan), just as big a guy as McQuigg, just as tough and with a preference for violence, has run the city for years. Scanlon and McQuigg have a history that goes way back. Scanlon has the city under his thumb. It's Scanlon who sees to it that McQuigg gets the worst assignments and the lousiest precinct. If McQuigg won't play the game, Scanlon will make his life as hard as he can. Recently Scanlon has started a partnership with a big, out-of-town syndicate run by The Chief, a man no one knows. The Syndicate wants to grow opportunities in Scanlon's territory and Scanlon wants more of the big-time. It's a partnership as unstable as a one-legged man on a merry-go-round. And it looks like only Captain Tom McQuigg is determined enough and smart enough to stop Scanlon in his tracks. There's nothing here that hasn't been done over and over. Director John Cromwell, however, keeps the clichés from bumping into each other too often. The story moves briskly along. But it's Mitchum and Ryan who make the movie worth watching. They're the unexpected pumpkin in the stale fig newton. Mitchum had finished his debt to society after his marijuana bust. Studio owner Howard Hughes wanted Mitchum in a role that would be on the side of the angels, with no fooling around on the other side. So Mitchum is a relentless good guy. He has no romantic interest except, seen one or twice, a good-looking, brave, supportive wife who Mitchum honors and loves. Mitchum's McQuigg plays by the book and even gives a speech or two condemning corruption. He's smart and clever, but his tricks to capture Scanlon are all aboveboard. Opposing him is Robert Ryan, who winds up playing a crook who is almost a psychopath. Scanlon cares for his younger brother, but slaps the kid around. He takes out inconvenient witnesses. He doesn't mind ordering a cop killed and doesn't mind doing the killing himself if need be. At times, he gets really, really mad. Mitchum and Ryan were big men. When they face off with others in the room, the others look small. While this movie isn't all that good, both men give solid performances and neither, in my view, is able to outshine or out act the other. Mitchum had plenty of star charisma by the time the movie was made. Ryan has plenty of actor charisma. I wound up watching them both and wondering what either of them would do next. The Racket is not an especially interesting movie, but Mitchum and Ryan give it what class it has. They played together in Crossfire, a film worth watching, with both men contributing a lot to that good movie. Lizabeth Scott, given little to do as a nightclub singer who turns on Scanlon, makes what she can of a seriously underwritten part. If you're a Robert Ryan fan, you might be interested in these lesser known films of his: The Woman on the Beach, The Set-Up, On Dangerous Ground, Inferno and The Day of the Outlaw. They're worth tracking down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly unspectacular but enjoyable crime thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A corrupt crime syndicate has moved into town, bringing with it new tools and pulling political strings instead of just using muscle. They join up with local boss Nick Scanlon who is old-school and trades on violence more than anything else. Into the middle of this corruption and rising crime comes honest policeman Capt Tomas McQuigg who has history with Scanlon but aims to bring him down and expose the syndicate's web of corruption as well.First of all, let me correct the entry on this page that classes this film as `film-noir', I assume that this has been added by another user that doesn't know what this means and equates it to any black and white film that involves crime. Needless to say, I do not see this as a noir, I see it as a basic crime story with tough cops and equally tough criminals. The basic story is good as it involves corruption as much as the usual crime boss characters. The film doesn't really be all it could have been and it stays at a tough if basic level for the majority. All told the story goes by slickly enough and is enjoyable despite that fact that you will have almost totally forgotten it fifteen minutes after it has finished.The cast help it to be better than it actually is and features two typically tough-talking and square jawed leads. Mitchum isn't as impressive as he can be but he does has a solid screen presence and he does well here. Ryan plays a character than has actually become more interesting with time due to other, similar characters than he has played since - his character is a bit toothless but that has more to do with codes of the time than his performance. The support cast are OK but nobody really stands out.Overall this is an OK film that will pass quite easily but has few qualities that will really stick in your mind for very long after you see it. Oh, and it's not a film-noir!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe not even a noir, but it has noir stylizing and some big names</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Racket (1951)A stellar cast and gritty photography can't quite lift this movie into the exciting classic it might have been. The basic problem here is the material, the story, which is slow and steady. It involves lots of conversations, all filmed with huge drama, about negotiating new ways of doing things as a national mob organization squeezes out the local mob boss.This is still a good movie, for sure. Robert Ryan plays the local boss getting overshadowed and he ramps it up as usual, beating a few people senseless. Robert Mitchum is given a dull role, not as a cop on the beat but as the chief of a precinct in charge of cops on the beat. And he was once buddies with Ryan, so they have a couple of one-on-ones. Lizabeth Scott is sharp and as good as she gets in her quirky femme fatale manner, but we don't see enough of her. Throw in Ray Collins as a slithering politico (a role he seems to have been born for) and William Conrad as a corrupt cop (with many pounds to gain before his days as t.v.'s Cannon, etc.) and you see how it looks like good stuff.A star behind the scenes is definitely cinematographer George E. Diskant, not a big name in the field but responsible for several terrific film noirs including the flawless "They Live by Night." He is in good form here even though there isn't much action. You only wish the director, John Cromwell, had more guts to let Diskant fly with things. Cromwell is one of those by-the-book directors who gets the job done but doesn't seem to see the opportunities to surprise the viewer. And he was loaded with opportunity here.The story is basically about life as a cop in a big city. That's why half the time (almost literally) we are in the police station. Or a squad car. There is no actual crime at the center of things (lots of crimes go zipping by, for sure). It's not about solving a crime, but about getting the old boss. It's Mitchum vs. Ryan. And Ryan is more fun. Things get fairly complicated, perhaps needlessly, but the overall trend is toward justice, and how it is best served in a corrupt world. Filled with good nuances, but packaged a bit awkwardly by the end.I say this isn't quite a film noir, but of course in the big picture most people would have to call it that. What it lacks (for me) is the loneliness of the lead character, and maybe even the evilness of the femme fatale. Mitchum is part of a big machine, and a sympathetic one (a huge police force). Ryan is just a thug, and a mean one with a small mind. It's pure crime stuff with noir stylizing. Good enough for a great evening--if you stay alert to all the details.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amusing, inexpensive, and predictable, this 50's gangster film's highlights are the snarling confrontations between Ryan and Top Cop Robert Mitchum. Ryan's cruelties are three-dimensional, but Mitchum seems to be thinking about something offscreen when he's not in a face-off with Ryan. Other secondary characterizations are quite vivid, especially by Ray Collins (a few years before "Touch of Evil") as a crooked political candidate, and William Talman, 50's TV stalwart, as the doomed rookie cop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any movie with principals like Robert Ryan, Robert Mitchum, and Lizabeth Scott certainly sounds "noir", especially with support like William Conrad and William Talman. But this isn't. It's more of a "detective story." That may be just as well because I understand that some people have difficulty pronouncing the word "noir." Briefly, Mitchum is the new Chief of Police brought into District Seven to clean up some of the corruption, which, as it turns out, leads all the way up through the judicial system. Mitchum is the straight arrow. He wears a suit and tie and has a domestic life, as hard as that is to believe.The proximate bad guy is Ryan as Nick Scanlon. He runs all the local rackets in this unidentified city with the connivance of the politicians. He's Ryan-as-bad-guy through and through. He never asks for quarter nor does he give any.This puts him on the spot because The Syndicate is moving into more sophisticated territory, with front organizations like The Acme Real Estate Company, money laundering, and probably structured derivative instruments. Ryan knows nothing about this stuff. He's an old-fashioned kind of gangster. Somebody gets in his way, he spanks him.The plot gets kind of complicated. Talman is a good cop who arrests Ryan's brother for carrying a concealed weapon. That puts him in bad with Ryan and he pays the price. Lizabeth Scott and Robert Hutton are folded into the story with nothing much to do.Most of the scenes are static shots of people standing around and talking. There are some brief action scenes too -- the obligatory car chase through the city streets, the explosion of a bomb on Mitchum's porch, two shootings. Well -- three, I guess, but the third takes place off screen and is pretty well handled.Some of the action scenes are less than well done. Mitchum and a horde of cops have a couple of hoods cornered in the garage of an office building. Mitchum pursues one of them up the stairs to the roof, where they have an ill-staged brawl. And what do the rest of the police do? Instead of rushing to his aid, they stand on the street below, with their arms folded across their chests, and watch the fist fight with considerable interest.Mitchum, when he got a good part, could really rise to the occasion, as he did in "Night of the Hunter," "Cape Fear," "The Sundowners", and "Farewell, My Lovely." This part must not have engaged him because he walks through it without any expression except an occasional smirk.The steely-eyed Ryan, on the other hand, is a cauldron of emotion. He has a terrific scene in which he tells Mitchum of the trouble his younger brother has caused him. Something like, "I paid his way through four colleges. FOUR! I even had to buy a chair at one of them. Well, not a chair. They call it an endowment." (Ryan kicks a chair.) The poor guy is beset by problems -- what with his brother determined to marry that night club canary, Scott, and the pressure from The Old Man above to lay off the rough stuff. Sometimes a man can't win for losing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Turn that racket down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Racket is a remake of the 1928 film of the same name, itself based on a popular Bartlett Cormack play. With Howard Hughes backing the production it was beset with a number of problems, interference and a few director changes were prominent and the script was tampered with to try and capture the zeitgeist of the Kefauver Committee Hearings that were running prominently at the time. Plot in basic form pitches Robert Mitchum's honest police captain against Robert Ryan's no good crime boss, and the location is some corrupt American city (almost certainly Chicago).At the time of its making, the film had a cast list that cried out as a roll for film noir/crime movie big hitters: Robert Mitchum (Out of the Past), Robert Ryan (Crossfire), Lizabeth Scott (Pitfall) and William Talman (Armoured Car Robbery), while in support there was the likes of William Conrad (The Killers), Ray Collins (Leave Her to Heaven) and Virginia Huston (also Out of the Past). Even looking at the directors who contributed on the production sees some fine genre credentials: John Cromwell (Dead Reckoning), Nicholas Ray (In a lonely Place), Mel Ferrer (The Secret Fury) and Tay Garnett (The Postman Always Rings Twice). But too many cooks can often spoil the broth, such is the case here.Solid enough story that's unspectacular in its execution, a choppy yet just about watchable experience, and certainly a softer crime movie than it really ought to have been. It has often been coined as being a hard-hitting melodrama, but the decent thriller sequences are cloaked by a narrative that actually doesn't flow with any conviction. There's also the odd casting of Mitchum as a good guy to get around, and the film doesn't achieve that, namely because Mitchum plays it distinctly unenthusiastically. Ryan, too, looks to be going thru the motions, while Scott is woefully underused. Thankfully there's good work from Talman, Collins and Conrad to enjoy, while Huston impacts with what little she is given to work with.On a surface viewing it's easy to believe that The Racket is a better film than it is. We enjoy seeing Ryan doing snarly villainy and throwing punches, and Mitchum, in spite of walking thru the picture, is always a watchable presence. Pulses are raised too with some gun play, auto pursuits and a roof top punch up. But strip those away and you find the odd scene slotted in that doesn't make a great deal of sense, they exist but serve no purpose since the writing doesn't recall them later. There's also the whiff of stupidity about the way the makers were clearly trying to craft an intelligent take on organised crime, yet the police really don't have to do much to nail these bad boys. It's all very well portraying Mitchum and Talman as bastions of good and pure, but at least let them have to do work to bring down the crims! While the ending is wholly unsatisfactory.The names involved ensure the film is never boring, but confused messages and a jumbled narrative make it a film of big intentions but not much substance. As for film noir? Well it does contain film noir type characters, but really this is about as film noir as my day- glow socks. 5/10</fullReview>

Lizabeth Scott is disappointing as a trashy blonde nightclub singer. She doesn't seem to get 'into' her part and delivers a bland, lack-luster performance. Although the cast's acting in general is good, the direction and cinematography are mediocre. The plot is predictable and holds no surprises, no twists, no denouement. Although the story hints at a mastermind who is pulling Ryan's strings, the angle is not developed and we never find out who it is (probably the Governor). Not a classic, but Ryan's performance is worth the cost of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incorruptible Cop Takes On Powerful Crime Syndicate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Racket" is a fast moving story about organised crime, political corruption and a dedicated police officer's struggle to restore the rule of law and order to a Midwest City, which is almost totally, in the grip of a national crime syndicate. Although this was a remake of a 1928 silent movie of the same name, it had some topical relevance in the early 1950s because television coverage of the Senate Committee hearings on organised crime (which were chaired by Senator Estes Kefauver) had captivated audiences on a large scale and made the general public at that time, sharply aware of how crime syndicates were operating.For dramatic purposes, the battle between good and evil is symbolised by the longstanding conflict between two men on different sides of the fence. Police Captain Tom McQuigg (Robert Mitchum) is the tough incorruptible cop who's determined to break the syndicate's stranglehold on the city and Nick Scanlon (Robert Ryan) is the local crime boss who's had to adjust to working for the syndicate since they've taken over the city.The syndicate wield immense power because they have a large number of politicians and law enforcement officers on their payroll and this power has frequently been used against McQuigg as he's repeatedly been transferred to unattractive jobs because of his stubborn refusal to be bribed into co-operating.When Scanlon becomes convinced that a man called Roy Higgins (Howard Chamberlain) has been spilling information about the syndicate to the State's Crime Commission, he arranges for one of his thugs to kill him. This action doesn't go down well with the syndicate who favour more sophisticated ways of dealing with trouble and they repeatedly try to get Scanlon to leave his old fashioned methods behind. Despite all their efforts, however, Scanlon is too entrenched in his ways to change and his continued use of violent methods becomes a constant source of tension between them.After a bomb explodes outside McQuigg's house and two suspects are chased by the police, one of the men gets trapped on a rooftop and fights with McQuigg before accidentally falling to his death. McQuigg is convinced that the other suspect was Scanlon's brother Joe (Brett King) and so sends an officer called Bob Johnson (William Talman) to find Joe and bring him in for questioning. Johnson arrests Joe for stealing a Rolls Royce that's in his possession and also arrests his girlfriend, a nightclub singer called Irene Hayes (Lizabeth Scott) as a material witness.The openly corrupt D.A. Mortimer X Welch (Ray Collins) quickly pulls the necessary strings to get Joe released from custody but no similar help is given to Irene Hayes because Scanlon doesn't like her. She reacts angrily to Joe's and the syndicate's lack of concern for her by threatening to spill the beans about Joe's involvement in Higgins' murder and this, in turn, sets off a sequence of events which lead to Scanlon's influence in the city being brought to an abrupt end.Robert Mitchum and Robert Ryan both give really muscular performances as the two extremely determined adversaries and Ray Collins and William Conrad (as Welch's special investigator) are excellent in their supporting roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Racket" ls A Slow Moving Movie That Shows Its Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout the movie, there are references made to the "old man," the leader of the organization that all the shady characters work for, an unseen presence who only contacts his underlings by telephone. I wonder if Howard Hughes knew when he was making this movie that was how he, Howard, was going to end up, always staying in the shadows as he operated his empire by telephone. Probably not, Howard was a hands on guy who mostly damaged the movies he worked on.Whether anyone could have remade the 20's play and movie The Racket into a good movie is an open question. The movie has a few flaws: a script that is 20 years out of place, too much talk, a wildly improbable gangster played by scenery chewing Robert Ryan and much of the action confined to a police precinct house that is staffed with two or three cop extras and no extras as civilian walk-ins. The scene at the start where all the cops line up for roll call and Robert Mitchum reads them the riot act, if they take one payoff they are out, is laughable.It seems from this speech that this is Mitchum's first day as Captain of the 7th Precinct, where he was reassigned because he was honest and arrested the wrong people. Yet, in this same precinct is the headquarters of Acme Real Estate, in an office building, the front company for the organization. Higgins, who works for the crime organization, is bumped off as he leaves Acme and, the scripts says, the murder will investigated by Mitchum, since the murder took place in the 7th Precinct. Why would a crime organization get Mitchum's character reassigned to a precinct where their headquarters are? I saw this movie on the Warner film noir DVD but I did not listen to the commentary, so I don't know if there is an explanation for this plot hole. At about the same time as this move was in release, in 1951, Warner Bros. had released Humphrey Bogart in The Enforcer and James Cagney had been in Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye, both movies that move at light speed compared to The Racket. These two other movies also had government groups investigating crime organizations, but that is their only similarity with The Racket.The Racket is a good example of tired scriptwriters going through the motions to collect a salary and of actors doing a good job collecting a paycheck. There is only one plus in this entire movie, William Conrad doing a fine job playing the cynical Sergeant Turk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only a year before this was released, its director gave us one of the greatest and the darkest movies ever: "Caged." Then "The Company She Keeps," which is not a success but has some good moments.This is a paint-by-numbers noir. (The term is anachronistic. So let's say a hash of crime thrillers.) Crooked politicians, good cops, nightclub singer with heart of gold. You name it.Robert Ryan gives his patented psychotic killer performance. And he was great at it. Very believable and surely against his own personality type. It is much the same part, though, that he had played in "Crossfire." Lizabeth Scott is the singer. She's fine.Robert Mitchum, though, is cast damagingly against type. He had a magnetic screen presence,. And in some movies -- notably "The Night of the Hunter" -- he was great. But a police captain who stands up against all corruption? He isn't bad. But he isn't believable, really, either. And this peculiar casting throws the whole thing off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slow starter, but a fine crime drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd never been able to get past the first couple of reels of The Racket on TV and it certainly looked like being the make-weight of Warner's new Film Noir collection, but once you get past the lunking Howard Hughes-imposed Nicholas Ray-directed prologue turns into a surprisingly engaging and gripping crime drama. Structurally it's certainly unusual, probably as a result of Hughes' typical interference - it's more than 17 minutes before Mitchum makes his entrance, and there are some sporadically awkward crosscuts to inserts shot by Ray and others after John Cromwell (who starred in the play the film was based on in the 1920s) had left.Robert Ryan is surprisingly not quite there on screen for once: not exactly bad, but somewhere between phoning it in and, in his early scenes at least, possibly drunk on set - his timing is slightly askew, his usual excellent instincts abandoned along with his sense of proportion in moments that are just a little over the top. But there's so much to admire that even the unlikely escalation of the feud between the two protagonists is carried along. There's a fine shootout in a garage, a neat car chase that sees the cops plow through a billboard for a mob-backed political candidate and a terrific death scene at the end. The supporting cast are intriguing too, with William Conrad's cop and Ray Collin's DA both corrupt but not so entirely that they're lost causes: they exist in a gray area that throws the leads into sharper relief.Eddie Mueller's audio commentary is the only extra on Warners' R1 DVD, but it's quite excellent and well worth listening to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The War Of The Roberts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sluggish, middling film noir rescued by the sturdy presences of its two lead stars, "The Racket" (1951) should prove of interest for all fans of this most American of cinematic genres. Producer Howard Hughes, who had just acquired a controlling interest in RKO three years earlier, had also been the producer of the 1928 silent film called "The Racket" (based on the stage play by Bartlett Cormack, which had featured Edward G. Robinson in the role of "the heavy"), and apparently thought this old property a perfect one for updating, as Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver and his investigating crime commission were then making headlines. Hughes brought together RKO's top two leading men, Roberts Mitchum and Ryan, hired John Cromwell to direct (Cromwell's "Caged," released a year earlier, had turned out to be a noir masterpiece), and engaged Sam Fuller to write a script (Hughes ultimately rejected the script and got William Haines to do a complete rewrite). As it turns out, though, despite all this great talent involved, and the assistance of a wonderful cast of supporting actors, the resulting film is a bland affair; somewhat slow moving, deficient in suspense and action, and even scarce in the juicy dialogue department. Still, as I said, the picture is certainly not without interest.In the film, Mitchum plays Capt. Tom McQuigg, seemingly one of the few honest cops in the purposely unnamed midsize city where the picture transpires (it is Anywhere, America). As head of his precinct, McQuigg's main concern is his childhood acquaintance Nick Scanlon (Ryan), a criminal boss whose old-school, violent methods have begun to rankle the more businesslike Syndicate that has been making inroads everywhere and bribing such figures as the Assistant D.A. Welch (played by the great character actor Ray Collins) and the police commissioner himself (William Conrad, perhaps best known today as TV's Cannon). With the Syndicate backing Welch in an upcoming election, matters between McQuigg and Scanlon come to a head, and are escalated when honest Officer Robert Johnson (not the bluesman, but rather played by William Talman, who many will recall as Perry Mason's adversary Hamilton Burger; an odd casting choice, for this viewer, since I recall Talman best as psycho fugitive Emmett Myers in Ida Lupino's great film noir of 1953, "The Hitch-Hiker") sets himself up as a decoy, and when nightclub chantootsie Irene Hayes (Lizabeth Scott, born Emma Matzo, who had previously been directed by Cromwell in the Humphrey Bogart 1947 noir "Dead Reckoning"), formerly engaged to Scanlon's kid brother, decides to testify against him...and thus, like Johnson, setting herself up for elimination by the Mob....The two Roberts, who had previously appeared together in the infinitely superior noir "Crossfire" in 1947 and would costar, many years later, in "The Longest Day" (1962) and "Anzio" (1968), DO work very well together here, although Ryan easily dominates the proceedings, his seething, violent Scanlon ("I was running this town when you cheap jerks were still eating at diners!") ever so much more memorable than Mitchum's overly laid-back McQuigg. Scott, despite her rather underwritten character, yet manages to make an impression, and gets to lip-synch the song "A Lovely Way to Spend an Evening" in a rather dingy-looking nightclub setting. Besides the great character actors already named, "The Racket" features Robert Hutton (future director of the 1962 schlock favorite "The Slime People") as a young reporter, Les Tremayne (who would appear IN "The Slime People"!) as the crime commission head, and Herb Vigran (as that nightclub owner) and Tito Vuolo (as Nick's barber), whose faces should certainly be familiar to baby-boomer fans of the old "Adventures of Superman" TV show. The film, despite its dearth of action, yet manages to offer at least four scenes that are comparatively gripping: a Mob-orchestrated explosion in McQuigg's house, a foreshadowing of a somewhat similar sequence in the awesome noir "The Big Heat" (1953); a nighttime dukeout that McQuigg engages in atop a roof with a Mob thug, with no musical accompaniment; a high-speed car chase between Nick and the cops; and the arrival of a pair of hit men at Johnson's suburban home."The Racket" is currently available on a fine-looking Warner Bros. DVD and features one of the best commentary tracks that I've heard in ages. This commentary, by the founder of the Film Noir Foundation, Eddie Muller, shows off Muller's encyclopedic knowledge in a highly conversational, understated manner. Among the dozens and dozens of fascinating tidbits that Muller shares with us is the fact that, despite his 1948 arrest for marijuana possession, Mitchum continued to enjoy the support and loyalty of Howard Hughes (who effectively salvaged his career). He also tells us that the Irene Hayes character was called "Helen Hayes" in the 1928 screen version, a name that had to be changed for obvious reasons; that Nicholas Ray directed numerous scenes after the shooting wrapped (the opening sequence in the governor's office, Mitchum's entrance, the rooftop fight, the nightclub scene, etc.); and that the two main differences between the two versions are the beefing up of the Johnson character and the introduction of the Syndicate angle. He also mentions that he prefers the silent version to the one under discussion here, which makes one wish that this original were available on DVD. The fact that it is not might warrant the investigation of a "crime" commission itself....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the 1940's and 50's it was easy to watch a crime/drama and with little effort, would be able to identify the good guys from the bad guys. This particular story called " The Racket " is based on the play written by Bartlett Cormack and was directed by John Cromwell. In it we have Robert Mitchum starring as Captain Thomas McQuigg, a no-nonsense, hard-bitten cop of the Old School who has decided to run a clean precinct. He does this by going after Nick Scanlon (Robert Ryan, who is at his best) as the most notorious mobster around. Scandlon believes his methods are fool proof and so effective he does not need to adapt. After all, he is backed up by 'The Big Boss', a corrupt District Atty. Mort X Welsh and an equally corrupt Det. Sgt. Turk (William Conrad.) The movie is standard Black and White 1950's drama with sufficient excitement to keep the characters alive and interesting. The audience is entertained and throughout the length of the story kept alert enough to learn the outcome. Excellent film fare. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Howard Hughes produced this film, and he knew a thing or two about the power of big money and racketeering. So it was natural for him to want to make a noir thriller about it. In the capable directorial hands of old pro John Cromwell, this is an excellent study of the octopus tentacles of crime syndicates and how a handful of people struggle against them, many getting hurt in the process. William Talman plays a stalwart and honest cop, so you can imagine what happens to him. The hero is Robert Mitchum, as the only incorruptible police captain on the police force in 'the city'. The main baddie in town is psycho crime boss Robert Ryan, just as menacing and ruthless as ever, except that he gets carried away by his passion for murder and out of impatience even kills someone himself, whereas crime bosses are meant to sit back and have this kind of thing done for them, like asking in the barber and the manicurist. Lizabeth Scott is the sultry gal caught up in it all, trying to decide whether to follow her cynical streak or go honest. Her part is not big enough to do her justice, but she does her usual good job. The best thing in the film is the powerful confrontational scene between Mitchum and Ryan, where they face each other down, and we see that Ryan is even taller than Mitchum (I always wondered!) What fireworks that brings! Always ominous and in the background is 'the Old Man', whom we never see, and who is the boss of bosses. Of course, nothing ever happens to him, and The Racket goes on as before, after this particular story is played out. This is a potent tale, well worth watching. The only thing missing is Gloria Grahame.</fullReview>

This is an intentional cover-up by the filmmakers and deliberately deflected at the end. As if to say, no matter how many of these street thugs we arrest, the master criminals of the Racket are above the law.This was a bold "oversight" slipped in, from an industry that was hand-cuffed by a code that stated...CRIME DOES NOT PAY.

In character, he frequently played sardonic, sadistic villains. Maybe being 6"4" with the swagger of the ex-Marine and college boxer he'd been, coupled with a face of chiseled granite, contributed. And he was never more entertainingly sociopathic than as Nick Scanlon in "The Racket." A loose cannon mobster allied with a national crime syndicate, he refuses to cool his natural taste for violence to protect his associates' political power plays. His adversary and ex-childhood pal is staunchly honest cop Robert Mitchum. Together, they strike sparks in what has been incorrectly described as a "noir" film. It's more of a tough, smart gangster movie. There are stand-outs throughout, led by Ray Collins' sweaty, corrupt DA and Don Porter's smooth syndicate "front." But it's Ryan who ambles off with the acting honors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Racket" (1951) is directed by... well, quite a few different pairs of hands actually. John Cromwell gets the credit, but he had uncredited directing help from Nicholas Ray and Mel Ferrer. It's hardly surprising actually when you look at who owned RKO when the film was made. None other than Howard Hughes, who had a panache for taking directors off movies at the drop of the hat. In fact, "Vendetta" from 1950, went through six directors! This constant reshuffling in the director's chair probably accounts for the differing feel to the picture. The beginning, quite bland and unmemorable mutates into a very good middle section before ending predictably. It would be interesting to see who did what on the motion picture.The screenplay is by William Wister Haines and W.R. Burnett (author of "Little Caesar"), and based on a play of the same name by Bartlett Cormack, which was also the basis for the 1928 film "The Racket", directed by Lewis Milestone. It is about McQuigg (Robert Mitchum), the only honest police captain on the force, and his loyal patrolman, Johnson (William Talman). Together, they take on the violent Nick Scanlon (Robert Ryan), who is backed by The Syndicate. Together, they plan to elect Welch (Ray Collins), the crooked prosecutor running for judge.Mitchum and Ryan are very good, as usual, but there is certainly an added intensity when they share the screen, and Lizabeth Scott, Ray Collins and William Conrad all contribute, good solid performances. The photography, by George E. Diskant, is very nice indeed, full of shadows and darkness. In fact, with a slightly less routing screenplay and just one director, this could have turned out to be something special. Still, as it is, it is good enough and a lot better than its reputation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Racket" is a 1951 film based on an old play. It was first made in 1928. This time around, it stars Robert Ryan and Robert Mitchum and is directed by James Cromwell. The other stars are Lizabeth Scott, Robert Hutton, Ray Collins and William Talman (both of whom were regulars on "Perry Mason").Robert Mitchum plays McQueeg, a police officer trying to keep his city and force free of corruption. It isn't easy with a crooked DA (Collins) and a loose cannon like thug Nick Scanlon (Ryan) around - even the other mobsters don't want him.When one of his best officers (Talman) is killed at headquarters, McQueeg becomes all the more determined to get Scanlon.The corruption in the city is shown as going right up to the top, with Don Porter giving orders for "the old man" and making sure that the machine stays well oiled. A dedicated, honest police commander is the last thing they want.Lizabeth Scott portrays a lounge singer in her usual smoky way, and Robert Hutton is a reporter who falls for her. Scott was beautiful and had a great screen presence, but she wasn't a big dramatic actress. Believe it or not, she was only 29 in 1951 and her "big" career days were over - that's the way it was back then if you were a beauty. Hutton (Barbara Hutton's cousin), who always reminds me a little of Jimmy Stewart, was an okay actor, but his career never really took off. Nevertheless, he worked constantly and said his life in Hollywood was a wonderful fantasy.Mitchum is stalwart in the lead. It's said that as RKO players, the scripts would be brought into the annual Christmas party, thrown on a table, and Mitchum would take half and Robert Ryan would take the other half. The actors weren't really interchangeable, but you can see how they would be in some of the films they did.Interesting film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But there's some fun to be had here in this slightly lame-brained noir. (Sorry to the above doctrinaire defender of a very narrow definition of noir, but "noir" is about a feeling and there's no strict definition I know of. There doesn't always have to be a femme fatale a la Barbra Stanwyck or Mary Astor to qualify -- though I won't argue it doesn't help!)Mainly, the fun in this from is from the always great Robert Ryan who sinks his teeth into a out-and-out nasty character. Ryan even finds a little bit of complexity.Poor Robert Mitchum, however, seems a bit uncomfortable playing a thoroughly stalwart lawman. It's more of a Gary Cooper part and there's nothing roguish for Mitchum to have fun with.Still, there's tons of familiar faces doing good work including the always good Lizabeth Scott (not quite a femme fatale in the classic sense, I admit) and William Talman as a braver but stupid cop. (I'm not sure if we're supposed to think he's not smart, but he the risks he takes are beyond foolhardy.)I particularly got a kick of out seeing the great Bill Conrad (aka Quinn-Martin's "Cannon" and "Rocky and Bullwinkle"'s bombastic narrator) as well as Don Porter as a sleazy ward healer. 20 years later Porter would play an equally oily (though arguably less evil) political type, as the Nixonian/Reaganesque Senator Crocker Jarman in "The Candidate."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just a personal preference of mine, but I would like to have seen the roles of Robert Mitchum and Robert Ryan reversed in the story. I think Mitchum makes for a much better bad guy, but when all is said and done, they each pulled off their roles pretty successfully.You know what was kind of interesting? For all the talk of the 'old man' behind the scenes of the national crime syndicate, he never appeared on screen. He was often referred to by that moniker or simply as the 'chief', and his guy Connolly (Don Porter) even entered his office once at the Acme Real Estate Company, but the guy remained a mystery throughout. Sounds like a maguffin to me.As an incorruptible cop, Captain McQuigg (Mitchum) makes it personal with Nick Scanlon (Ryan), the one time city crime boss who finds himself subservient to the dictates and operating style of the old man. You know, I couldn't quite figure out how the old man kept his lieutenants under his thumb without resorting to the violence rout. Sure he had a lot of politicians and cops in his pocket, but every once in a while it would seem some muscle would be required. Still, you can't be a hothead like Scanlon was, or you wind up like Sonny Corleone.The story had me slightly confused at one point, when McQuigg got back to the Seventh Precinct Station right after the hood he was tailing fell off the roof, a desk officer tells him that District Attorney Rogers is waiting for him in his office. By that time, we had already seen the billboard touting D.A. Mortimer Welsh (Ray Collins) for district judge. Then, Nick Scanlon kept the confusion going by continually referencing Welsh as 'Judge', probably figuring it was a foregone conclusion. Or maybe it was just Scanlon's style to choose his words inaccurately, he kept calling Irene Hayes (Lizabeth Scott) a 'tommy', but nobody seemed to react to it. Oh well.The story ends with most of the bad guys getting their due. One knows that taking down Scanlon had to be part of the resolution here, but it was more than fitting that D.A. Welsh and his crony Turk (William Conrad) would be served subpoenas for all the graft and corruption they were involved in. The picture closes with Captain McQuigg's doleful lament about the slow, constant struggle to keep the gears of justice sand free. It's too bad Johnson (William Talman) didn't make it to the end of the picture, I was really looking forward to his explanation on how two dead mugs wound up in his living room.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Many Cooks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 80-minutes has the cast elements of a memorable crime drama?Ryan, Mitchum, Talman, Conrad. Then too, RKO's head honcho Howard Hughes actively participated, along with a narrative of city corruption that's handled in some revealing detail. So why aren't the results more memorable than I think they are. To me, the screenplay is more congested than it should be. For example, Liz Scott's role is clearly there for marquee value, adding nothing to the plot, other than crowding up the many characters and sub-plots. Considering the number of writes, rewrites, and re-shoots (IMDB), perhaps the crowding is understandable. All in all, the number of production fingerprints fail to blend into an impactful whole, leaving a movie of a few memorable parts.Ryan, of course, is Ryan, scary in his intensity, and wholly convincing in his criminal belligerence. Mitchum, however, is cast against type as the unwavering precinct captain. In fact, Captain McQuigg runs his precinct much like Scanlon's (Ryan) territorial tyrant. Thus McQuigg is more like a competing territorial chief than a neutral enforcer of the law, (note how McQuigg unlawfully tears up a legal writ.). The film's worth watching for its outlining of how corruption works in a city environment. District Attorney Welch (Collins) and Sgt. Turk (Conrad) betray their public trust by allying with the crime syndicate, becoming instrumental as go-betweens and influence-peddlers. This was a period in the country's history (1951) when organized crime was getting headlines thanks to Sen. Kefauver's investigation committee. So Hollywood's response is not surprising. I just wish the movie had lived up to its potential, but I guess there's a lesson here about too many cooks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE RACKET is a very familiar crime story produced by Howard Hughes. The typically mild-mannered Robert Mitchum stars as a cop leading a task force against the sinister criminal organisation blighting his city, and the man at the top is a ruthless murderer who has to be stopped at all costs.What follows is entirely predictable to anybody who's familiar with this genre in any way, but at the same time it's rather engaging with a literate script and some excellent performances from actors who lift the material above its pulpish origins. Mitchum is only middling here as he seems to be sleepwalking through the role, but Robert Ryan's kingpin is much better and rather hissable. The real scene-stealer, though, is William Talman (THE HITCH-HIKER) as the rookie cop who finds himself involved in something far beyond his means.</fullReview>

In fact, I got such an enjoyable kick out of The Racket's poker-faced story-line that I sat through it twice.Containing a nice mix of snappy, mean-mouthed dialogue, aggressive shoving around, and unexpected day-time shootings, The Racket certainly seemed to have all the right elements required to carry it through (without much disappointment) to its inevitable "crime-doesn't-pay" ending.When it came to the likes of the 2 Roberts (that's Mitchum as the no-nonsense cop, Capt. Tom McQuigg, and Ryan as the nasty villain, Nick Scanlon), I thought that these 2 bad-boys of crime-cinema filled their respective roles as comfortably as a pair of well-fitting gloves.My one beef about this picture comes down to The Racket's token femme fatale and lounge singer, Irene Hayes. Played by the tone-deaf Lizabeth Scott, man, when this cheap canary performed her big number at the Paradise Club, I absolutely cringed at her utter lack of talent.Even though Irene did, indeed, get slapped around and royally insulted, once or twice, it didn't come anywhere near close enough to what I thought she actually deserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Racket" was another of Howard Hughes projects dealing with a State's Crime Commission investigation of organized crime.The "new" syndicate, which frowns on physical violence, has moved into town and is working with old style gangster Nick Scanlon (Robert Ryan). The Commision has brought back Captain McQuigg (Robert Mitchum) from an obscure post to head up the fight against Scanlon. McQuigg and Scanlon it seems, have a history and make this confrontation "personnal".Scanlon prefers the old way of eliminating his problems. The new syndicate headed by someone called "The Old Man" (whom we never see or have identified) frowns on violence. Front man Connolly (Don Porter) makes this clear to Scanlon. Scanlon of course stays his course.The film leads to the inevitable confrontation between McQuigg and Scanlon.Drifting through the story are "Tommy" girl Irene Hayes (Lizabeth Scott) as a gold digging singer who tries to snare Scanlon's brother Joe (Brett King). "Tommy" by the way refers to the term "tom boy" and you can read into that what you may. Robert Hutton plays a cub reporter smitten with the aforementioned Irene. William Tallman is Officer Bob Johnson an ambitious beat cop, Ray Collins a corrupt District Attorney, William Conrad as DA Sgt. Turk and Walter Sande as Sgt. Delaney.Ryan as always walks away with the picture playing the brutal gangster. Mitchum who was really to young at 34 to be a police captain walks through his role. Scott as the "femme fatale" of the piece is also good. Of the supporting cast, Tallman and Collins, who would appear together in the "Perry Mason" TV series, stand out. Conrad, who had played Matt Dillon in Radio's "Gunsmoke" and appear in the 70s TV series "Cannon" is also effective as the sleazy detective.As he had on many other occasions Howard Hughes took control of the film after the initial shoot directed by John Cromwell. He added scenes re-shot others and re cut the film. Many of the new scenes were directed by Nicholas Ray.Other familiar faces in the rather large cast are Joyce McKenzie and Virginia Houston as two distraught police wives and Les Tremayne, Milburn Stone, Herb Vigran, Harry Lauter and Howard Petrie in a variety of bits.A remake of Hughes' 1928 film of the same name.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good guy Mitch?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick Scanlon(Robert Ryan) is a big time crime boss who is forced into partnership by a national crime syndicate that has just moved into town. Captain Thomas McQuigg(Robert Mitchum) is the goody goody police man trying to clean up the city and rid it of scum like Scanlon. Scanlon has corrupt police and judges at his beck and call, they at Scanlon's behest make sure McQuigg keeps being moved from precinct to precinct because he causes such a fuss and gets the job done.This time however Mc Quigg is making a stand and hopes to force Scanlon into a mistake and by getting the girlfriend (Lizabeth Scott) of Scanlon's brother to testify against him, but Scanlon has a knack of getting away when witnesses disappear, and so the cat and mouse begins. Ryan as always is the perfect bad guy, always menacing, I did have my doubts about Mitchum though playing way against type as the squeaky clean cop, but by the end he had me won over,William Talman of Hitch Hiker fame is very good too as the honest and loyal Office Johnson as too are the fine supporting cast of William Conrad and Ray Collins.Just for a moment I thought this was going to a bleak bitter/sweet ending,but it resolves itself sweetly right at the death. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull, Dated and Unoriginal Gangster Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Racket" combines elements of two distinct, if related, sub-genres of the crime movie. It was made in 1951, and visually it is an obvious example of the film noir style which was so popular around that time. In terms of its subject-matter, however, it has more in common with a gangster drama from the twenties or thirties, even though it has a contemporary fifties setting. That is perhaps unsurprising, given that it is based on a Broadway stage play from 1926 and that an earlier film version was made in 1928. The film is set in an unnamed American city, dominated by a local mobster named Nick Scanlon who has allied himself to a national crime syndicate. The syndicate is headed by a shadowy figure known only as "the old man", who is never seen. Scanlon believes himself to be untouchable because of widespread corruption, which means that he has several local government officials and police officers on his payroll. The one man who worries him is police captain Tom McQuigg, one of the few honest senior officers on the force, but he has so far managed to deal with this problem by using his influence to have McQuigg transferred to out-of-the-way precincts. Until, that is, one of his hit men is ill-advised enough to carry out a killing in McQuigg's district. That is enough to give McQuigg the reason he needs to begin a crusade not only against Scanlon but also against organised crime throughout the city.Lizabeth Scott was an actress who seemed to specialise in films noirs, often playing a sexy, seductive femme fatale. Here her character Irene Hayes, a nightclub singer, is still sexy, but ends up on the side of the angels when she puts her life at risk by deciding to testify against Scanlon after witnessing a killing ordered by him. There is also a sub- plot involving a romance between Irene and Dave Ames, a naive young journalist. Robert Mitchum was another actor with plenty of experience in the noir style. His McQuigg, however, is rather different from most noir heroes, who were often conflicted or morally ambiguous characters. McQuigg may occasionally act like a prototype Dirty Harry; his methods of interrogation, for example, are not always the most gentle, and on one occasion he rips up a writ of habeas corpus because he believes (with good reason) that the judge who has issued it has done so corruptly. Despite these lapses, however, the audience is supposed to accept him as one of the good guys, an incorruptible and indefatigable campaigner against crime and corruption.Although I have never seen the 1928 version of "The Racket", the basic story- tough-but-honest cop takes on the Mob- is familiar enough to me from innumerable gangster movies, and it was doubtless already a cliché even in 1951. This film, however, simply goes through the motions of acting out that old story without adding anything original to it. A much more effective version of a similar story was told in another fifties film noir "The Big Heat" where the hero Dave Bannion, played by Glenn Ford, is a typically flawed, conflicted noir hero, and therefore more interesting. There are occasionally some effective action sequences, such as a rooftop fight between Mitchum and a gunman, and there are some good acting contributions, such as the one from William Talman as another honest cop, but the film also has its weaknesses. The plot, especially towards the end, can be difficult to follow, and some details do not always ring true. The willingness of the bad guys to gun down their victims in front of witnesses, for example, might suggest that they were actively trying to make McQuigg's job easier for him. However many crooked detectives, prosecutors or judges Scanlon might have on his books, I felt that in reality he would have shown a little more concern for his own self-preservation; sooner or later there will come a case in which the accused's guilt is so manifest that no District Attorney could refuse to prosecute and no jury could do anything other than convict. Some of the great films noirs- the likes of "Double Jeopardy", "The Big Sleep" or "Pickup on South Street"- remain as watchable as they were when they were first made. Indeed, many of these films are more highly regarded today than they were in the forties and fifties. "The Racket", however, does not belong in this class. It might use the techniques of film noir, but it comes across as a dull, dated and unoriginal gangster flick. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Strung</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though light on excitement this multi-directed (five helmers in all were involved and that was before Hughes added his own once-over-lightly) is strangely satisfying albeit it is more Detective Story than Kiss Of Death. If Ryan walks away with it and Mitchum allows him to do so it is rich in supporting players such as William Conrad and Ray Collins sweating his way through a de-clawed xerox of his 'Boss' Jim Gettys in Orson's Citizen Kane. The times they are a changin' and dinosaur Robert Ryan is a definite liability to the more white-collar mob with eyes to take over the nameless city. Mitchum's incorruptible cop is the white knight attempting to slay the dragon and that's about it plot-wise. Ryan appears to have been frightened by Widmark's Tommy Udo in Kiss Of Death even to the climactic murder in the precinct house. Overall worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie but short on credibility</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Technically, this movie is enjoyable if you're in to old crime dramas. However if you are detail oriented to the point they drive you nuts like me here are the problems with this flick that detract from its credibility.1. Robert Mitchum, born 1917, was a 33 year old experienced police captain who looked closer to being a rookie. His part called for a 40's something actor.2. William Talman, born 1915, was a 35 year old rookie cop who looked closer to being a captain.Maybe Talman and Mitchum should have reversed taken each other's roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent and unjustly ignored crime melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First class crime melo, very hard-boiled and with a top-notch cast. It's about the Syndicate or the Mob or whatever you choose to call them and it has a good, complex plot. The principal bad guy is Robert Ryan at his psychopathic best and Robert Mitchum is the tough, doggerel policeman out to get him. It's a surprisingly down-beat and hard-bitten movie with an excellent script by William Haines and W R Burnett and first-class direction from John Cromwell. (It's a much looser movie than we expect from Cromwell; he makes it visually exciting, though Nicholas Ray, among others, is also said to have had a hand in it). It is seldom revived but it remains a classically under-rated film noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Against All Comers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE RACKET is not a great film noir, but it is an interesting variant on the typical formula.In normal film noir, the central figure is isolated - he or she is struggling to survive a secret enemy or to prove his or her innocence of a capital crime charge. Think of Ray Milland in THE BIG CLOCK. Think of Bogart in THE MALTESE FALCON or Alan Ladd in THE BLUE DAHLIA. But here that central figure is hardly sympathetic.Robert Ryan is Nick Scanlon. He is an old fashioned criminal boss - a Capone, if you will, rather than say a Frank Costello. Capone chewed up all his enemies to make himself boss of Chicago. Costello could order violence too, but he preferred modern business methods. Although he had his prison periods, at the end of his life he was a highly respected criminal chairman of the board type (he enjoyed it when he entered a party or dinner of his cronies, and the band would strike up the theme from THE GODFATHER). Although Capone was to be involved in the formation of the national syndicate, he ended up in Alcatraz, and then went insane from syphilis. Scanlon has never sought favors from anyone - he is his own law. He tells crooked politicians (like Ray Collins here) what they have to do. And Collins keeps warning Lt. McQuigg (Robert Mitchum) to lay off or go easy on Scanlon. But McQuigg has other ideas.So does an unseen figure we hear of called "The Old Man". His representative is Don Porter, and Porter is explaining to the crime bosses of the area that "The Old Man" does have a specific plan of operations that is more in line with the Costello model than the Capone one. Everyone will be taken care of, and modern corporate technique will replace the tommy gun and dynamite bomb. But "The Old Man" and Porter do not reckon with one snarly critic: Ryan. He is not interested in falling into line for anyone. Who is "The Old Man" anyway?So Ryan, by his personality and violent nature finds that the authorities represented by Mitchum are pushing in on one side, and the modern criminal syndicate (represented by Porter) is pushing in on the other side. And starting with that problem he decides that if they want a fight (and "they" means all comers) they'll get it. Capone might have approved - so would have Tony Carmonte in SCARFACE.The situation is worsened by the activities of William Talman, one of Mitchum's best junior officers, who keeps thwarting Ryan's schemes, and inflicts damage on him. Ryan's answer is to mark Talman for destruction, no matter how this worsens the situations with Mitchum and with Porter.As you can see this is an interesting situation. As an interesting enough film noir it is a "7" out of "10". A bit more character development of Ryan's kingpin might have raised a bit in the film noir pantheon, but (sadly) that was not done here. Worth watching but not as good as it could have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable but big name cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, you can predict this plot pretty much. What is amazing is the cast - besides Robert Mitchum, you have William Conrad (Cannon and radios Matt Dillion), William Talman (DA Burger on TV's Perry Mason, and Lt Tragg on Perry Mason- Ray Collins as one of the main characters. It is not often to see all of these cast in the same picture. Took me quite a while to realize Conrad was there until he finally spoke. This is a film noir film about the mob and how they control people. Mitchum is young and active in this one. Yes, I watched it for the cast more than the plot but I have seen a lot worse pictures.Just enjoy it for what it is, a grade B under feature made for twin bills in 1951. They were not trying for a blockbuster here. Just a good film and they certainly achieved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A crime boss has all the city politicians on his payroll, but must contend with an honest police captain. Saddled with an extended and talky exposition, this film takes a while to get going, but then turns into a solid crime drama. As the crime boss, Ryan is a mean, sneering, and intimidating figure, a type of role he could have played in his sleep. Mitchum is fine as the cop who has the guts to take on Ryan. As a nightclub singer, Scott not only looks like Lauren Bacall but also displays the toughness typical of Bacall in her films with Humphrey Bogart, including "Dead Reckoning," which was also directed by Cromwell. It is helped by a good supporting cast.</fullReview>
