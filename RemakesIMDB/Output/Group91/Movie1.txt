		<shortDescription>By far the best of quite a few movie adaptations over the years of the classic children's story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie in 1961, when I was fourteen, and it became one of only four movies seen during my life that actually moved me to tears in the cinema (for the record, the others were LOVE IS A MANY SPLENDORED THING; THE PROUD REBEL and THE STORY OF RUTH). A DOG OF FLANDERS is a superb tear-jerker, filmed on location in Holland and Belgium in 1959, but set in 1900. It stars the then twelve-year-old David Ladd as the orphan Nello and veteran actor Donald Crisp as his elderly and infirm grandfather. Although devoted to one another, they live a very poor life selling milk from a hand cart they pull around Antwerp. Nello is an artistic, intelligent and sensitive little boy who wants to paint like his idol, Peter Paul Rubens, but he has no money to enable him to study or to buy proper materials to paint with. They find a badly treated dog, left to die at the roadside by his heartless owner and take him home and care for him. Because he's been so badly treated, it takes time for him to accept them as his friends. But eventually, they gain his trust. Nello names him Patrasche...the name that Rubens had given to his dog...and he becomes part of the small family, even pulling the cart when grandfather is unable to do so any more. One day, Nello has just finished a sketch of the old man dozing in a chair outside their one-roomed hut and goes to show him the finished drawing. But he cannot awaken him and slowly, he comes to realize that his beloved grandfather is dead. Completely bereft and unable to keep up the rent on their home, Nello and Patrasche are evicted by an uncaring landlord in the middle of winter. Somehow, they have to learn how to survive without his grandfather in a harsh and bitter world. A DOG OF FLANDERS, from the 1872 novel by Ouida, had been filmed previously, notably in 1934, but never so well as this. It really is beautifully done all round and everyone connected with it should feel very proud of the result. The music score by Paul Sawtell and Bert Shefter is very haunting and David Ladd, who had previously given such a truly wonderful performance alongside his father Alan in THE PROUD REBEL (1958), is superb. David and I shared the same Christian name, were both the same age and had similar looks, which made it easy for me to identify with him in A DOG OF FLANDERS, which became one of my all time favorite movies. Theodore Bikel has a good character role in it as an artist who befriends Nello, eventually adopts him and helps him to realize his dreams. Beautifully filmed in CinemaScope and Color by De Luxe, this is a wonderful film and you really would have to have a heart of stone not to be moved by it. I give it ten out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic children's film, simply-told and moving.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Early effort of producer Robert Radnitz (SOUNDER, WHERE THE RED FERN GROWS) is distinguished by colorful location photography (in the Netherlands), fine acting and an uncondescending script.David Ladd (son of Alan) gives a believable, unmannered performance as the orphan boy with artistic longings, and veteran Donald Crisp shines, as always, as his loving grandfather. Character actor Theodore Bikel is also an asset, playing the prickly artist who somewhat reluctantly takes the boy under his wing. Dog-lovers should note that the title canine's role in this story is important yet not central, serving mainly to set the plot in motion. But it's a lovable pooch nonetheless, and goes through its paces with perfect doggish realism, a tribute to its skilled handlers and a refreshing change of pace from such modern CGI manipulations as SNOW DOGS.This film is unflinching in its portrayal of what can be a harsh and uncaring world, and younger and/or sensitive children may find it tough going before the ultimately happy ending. My daughter saw this when she was 8; two-thirds of the way into it she was weeping openly and was only somewhat mollified by the heart-warming conclusion. Recommended for 10 and up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, this is the version to get!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is the classic Flemmish version of the "boy and his dog" tale as young Nello, apparently about 11 or 12, struggles to establish his identity as an artist amidst adverse circumstances. David Ladd, Alan Ladd's son, plays the protagonist: he was 13 at the time, but somehow managed to play an 8-year-old in his next film! Anyway, this is the real story, without all the silly, sappy and frankly unbelievable stuff and coincidences gratuitously added in the Disney version of 1999. Even the dog is more convincing! David Ladd is quite good, though his emotions seem a bit forced at times and he's certainly not "one of the greatest child actors of all time" as his filmography touts. Donald Crisp as the grandfather and a so-young Theodore Bikel as the temperamental artist both offer excellent performances. Perhaps life was indeed harder then, and as the late Douglas Adams would point out, digital watches had not been invented, but children were still considered PEOPLE: they could work for a living, enjoy the fruits of their labor, and even live alone if they chose -- or with a dog. All that is gone now. Am I the only one who questions that this is "progress"?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back when I was 14 I saw A Dog of Flanders and viewing it today showed it is a fresh and appealing as I remember it.Young David Ladd is Nello Daas the aspiring young artist who lives with his elderly infirm grandfather, Donald Crisp. The two of them take in a cruelly treated dog and name it Patrasche after the dog that famed artist Peter Paul Rubens had. Life's pretty hard for the Daases, becomes doubly so after Crisp dies and young Nello can no longer care for Patrasche. Life also has a funny way of resolving things as well.Besides Ladd and Crisp the only other English speaking player in the film is Theodore Bikel. The continental locations in Belgium and the Netherlands which were one country back at the time this story takes place are well photographed. Ladd, Crisp, Bikel as the artist who recognizes the talent in Ladd give wonderful performances.There was another version of A Dog of Flanders done by RKO studios in the Thirties. It might be nice to see for comparison, but I doubt it matches this one.For this A Dog of Flanders is a timeless family classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dog of Flanders trivia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fans of the movie "Old Yeller" nay be interested in knowing that the same dog who played the title role in that movie, plays the title role in this version of "A Dog of Flanders".The dog trainer on this movie is Frank Weatherwax, the brother of Lassie's trainer, Rudd Weatherwax.Fans of "Lassie Come Home" (1942) may notice that Donald Crisp, who played the father in that movie, plays David Ladd's father here. Donald Crisp had roles in three "Lassie" movies, and was also in Disney's "Greyfriars Bobby".Donald Crisp has a long history with dogs. He himself was the owner of "Strongheart", a German shepherd who stared in several silent movies.Wax</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gem to be shown at Xmas or at any time we need reminding what compassion is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it is a tad old fashioned, but this film still can knock one on one's ass with its simple and powerful story. If only films today could be as simply endearing as this one. The acting is not award winning, yet it is heartfelt,honest and straightforward. The score is fantastic as it is truly an organic part of the film's fabric and the photography is breathtaking as it should inspire a visit to Antwerp and leave one in wonder when one realizes how beautifully the camera has captured it's energy, it's town square,it's gorgeous cathedral and especially the Peter Paul Reubens paintings. Classic may be an overused and well worn word but it perfectly describes this film. Small, honest and completely unpretentious it still stands as one of the most perfect children's stories that all ages can enjoy,weep and rejoice at.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On May 30th, 1640, the great Flemish Painter, Peter Paul Rubens, died leaving a plethora of great works. It is among these masterpieces, The Raising of the Cross, which became the foundation of perhaps one of the most beloved Hollywood films of all time. The movie is called " A Dog of Flanders " and is directed by James B. Clark. " It tells the story of a young boy named Nello Dass (David Ladd) who with his grandfather, Jehan (Donald Crisp) reside in the city of Antwerp and make a modest living delivering milk. Nello does his best to aid his aging, ailing grandfather, who plans of sending the boy to sea or have him become an apprentice miller. Nello on the other hand dreams of one day becoming a great artist like Rubens. Unfortunately, their poverty prevents their ambitions. Instead,during their delivery rounds, they discover a badly abused cart dog lying in a ditch. With care and compassion they nurse the dog back to health and with the new name Patrasche, becomes part of the impoverished family. However, several obstacles confront Nello, namely, his grandfather's sudden death and the cruel former owner of the dog returns to claim him. Theodore Bikel plays Piet van Gelder, is the gruffy painter who befriends the boy and does a remarkable job of adding sympathetic cohesion to this story. With a touch of humanity, love and endearment, the audience is allowed a moment to believe that a single act of kindness can bring tears and inner joy. Easily Recommended to all. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the loveliest family flicks ever, be aware that a river of tears will fall but there is a happy ending, too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pre-teen Nello (David Ladd) lives with his grandfather (Donald Crisp) in Antwerp. The young boy's parents are dead and the two remaining family members are extremely poor. Renting a small house, the two eek out a meager living delivering milk for the local dairymen. But, alas, grandpa has a bad leg and other health issues, too. One day, Nello finds a badly beaten dog on the side of the road, having been left there to die by his horrible peddler owner, who used the dog to pull a small wagon. Despite their poverty, Grandpa consents to taking the canine home and trying to save his life. They succeed. Now, there are three mouths to feed. Nello spends his spare time drawing, having talks with a neighboring girl, and going to the local cathedral to view a painting by Rubens. Now, the dog helps Nello make deliveries of milk while grandfather rests his leg, leading to the peddler trying to "steal" his dog back when he sees the boy. Also, Nello makes friends with a local artist, who encourages the lad to enter a drawing contest. The prize money would help him greatly. But, with Grandpa's health declining and the local milk merchants turning to others for the deliveries, what will be that fate of three good-hearted and hard-working souls? This is a lovely, lovely film that, once again, I have missed over the years. For one thing, the film may have been shot in black and white but the colorized version I watched was vibrantly appealing. What's not to love about the country of Holland, with its windmills and tulips everywhere? The cast is very fine, too, with Ladd and Crisp giving extremely touching turns, backed up nicely by the supporting cast members. The lovable four-legged star is a pleasure as well. Also complimenting the film are a nice score, a sweet script and a varied direction, where twists and turns result in tears and smiles alike. Families, everywhere, do your clan a huge favor and get this classic 1959 film. Every viewer, young and old, will benefit from AND enjoy a showing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I would wish I had seen it thirty-five years ago.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The classic Japanese cartoon series, first broadcast in Spain in 1979-80, still remains a part of my childhood. Every Sunday lunchtime I would follow Nello's adventures in our black and white TV set and wouldn't miss it in the world. After one whole year and fifty-two episodes Nello and Patrashe died together in the night of Christmas Eve, at Antwerpen cathedral, alone, hungry and frozen to death in what must be the most devastating ending of all time to a children's tale. I must have cried rivers. I can't remember. Many years later, when I learnt that there was a film adaptation made by Hollywood in the late 50s, I sought it out eagerly. I finally got a copy at HMV, about four or five years ago. It is disappointing though that it is a rather mediocre edition, presented in TV format instead of the original Cinemascope in which the movie was shot ?as listed in the technical features section in the film's page -, and with a rather depreciated image quality with very strong colours and a bit of a blurred image. It looks just like it was transferred from an old VHS edition back from the 80s. But well, this is better than nothing. I watched it again yesterday after a long time, and for 95 minutes I was a young boy again. I am glad ?even though I usually am against drastic changes in the plot of film adaptations from classic novels- that Nello and Patrashe do not die at the end and that there still is hope for them. Nello is to be taken by the painter as an apprentice and so he will fulfil the greatest dream of his life. A very beautiful film, entirely shot in location in the unique Flemish landscapes and the medieval town of Antwerpen. A beautiful score, a gorgeous cinematography and art direction, and a perfect cast with David Ladd ?a boy actor who could actually act, and who was the spitting image of his father, the great Alan "Shane"- as the gentle and sensitive Nello, good old dear Donald Crisp (How Green was my Valley, National Velvet) as the grandfather, and Theodore Bikel as the grumpy and apparently cold and soulless artist that nevertheless will save the day and Nello's life. A charming little film that teaches children to love animals, and about the values of compassion, humility, honesty and the pursuit of one's dreams.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One flaw, but a fatal one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not read the original novel this movie is based on, so I can't say if this movie is better or worse than its source material. But I can judge the movie on its own merits. The movie does have a number of strengths. It looks pretty nice, filmed on location in the Netherlands and Belgium with some good photography. The acting is also pretty good, with a child protagonist that (thank goodness) is not annoying, and the adult actors also doing well. The movie also has some positive messages, ranging from kindness to animals to encouraging people to stick to their dreams and never giving up.So what goes wrong with the movie to make it not worth a recommendation? Well, to put it bluntly, the movie is quite dull. It's very slow-moving; you have to wait until more than halfway through before some serious problems come up for the characters. And even from that point on, the movie's energy level still remains quite low. I'm certainly not asking for blazing action and suspense that's found in today's hyper-kinetic family films, but I think the story could have been made to be more engaging. Too bad - there are some nice things about this movie, but in the end it's a miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice movie but sadly not the entire true story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do know the true story so it lives me disappointed to see that most of the movies make it a happy end while it should be a very sad ending. The story should tell an other morality then that the romantic version does. But yes that is what we've come to expect from Hollywood productions. In the real story the boy Nello Dies with his Dog Patrasche in front of the painting they visited many times before since it provided them with hopes for life and his painting aspiration. They died in a cold and harsh time because of things like: no income (selling milk was made impossible since he was accused of setting fire to a mill), no food and no one who could or cared to help. So the lessons to be learned from this and similar stories remains merely an echo and are quickly forgotten. Like all the real important ones. Yes it's hard to deal with real live and to be confronted with the truth. But like once said; if we pretend to be searching for the truth we also should be ready to hear it or be willing to listen.</fullReview>
