		<shortDescription>Dull, unnecessary remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah's "Straw Dogs" remains a most disturbing, morally ambiguous confrontation between the brute code of uneducated farmboys with the complex attempts at rationalization by a sophisticated, neurotic, hyper-educated urban college professor attempting to escape the responsibilities of living in an increasingly complex world. It is also a magnificently constructed motion picture, elegantly photographed, brilliantly edited, hauntingly scored, with powerhouse performances from every actor.This wholly unnecessary remake on the other hand is amateurish swill - banal photography, drama-class acting (and why not? all the characters have been reduced to caricature), and soap-opera rewriting. It's basically a television movie with some sex and violence thrown in for the fan-boy crowd. It's even got the requisite car-chases, and supposedly pointed dialog about adultery and motivations, blah blah blah.Graceless, visually dull, with no sympathetic characters, but a lotta boom! crash! foe those who think loud noises and pyrotechnics make up for lack of intelligence and imagination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An embarrassing attempted 'remake' of a great piece of film making, by a cast and crew who evidently have no idea what the original was all about. Peckinpah's original raised questions - you left the theater feeling awkward, self-conscious, asking the same question the lead character was asking himself - 'how do I find my way home now?' This pseudo-remake leaves you wondering, "Is it over yet? Why did I waste money on this? Won't this be show up on DVD soon?"Because that's all it is, a poorly made routine B movie - part domestic melodrama, part crime shocker, aimed at the DVD market.Wholly forgettable, with blasé cinematography, second rate photography - utterly forgetful.See the original - a strange, uncomfortable and difficult but insightful film that holds its own after 4 decades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you're going to remake a nearly perfect movie, don't botch it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake has no reason to exist. It is shallow and poorly acted and lacks most of the tense emotions and moral questions raised by the original. Hollywood at its worst, cellophane-wrapped, uninspired, made-for-TV quality, cookie cutter remake. Of course, it is padded with clichés, cheap effects and mass-appeal frosting to bring out brain-dead teen movie goers. Why did a great actor like James Wood let himself get suckered into this disaster? This could have been an so-so B-action movie but trying to cash in on the status of Sam Peckinpah's cult classic is a really cheap move. It also forces me to give it a 1-star rating rather than a 4 to 5 rating it could have earned if it didn't ask to be compared with the former. If you consider watching this movie, please rent the original instead. It is still as intense as it was in 1971 and actually raises a lot of disturbing questions. A true classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ambiguity and subtleties within every character's actions have been replaced with spoon-fed notions of right and wrong.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a testament to the power of Straw Dogs' story (Sam Peckinpah's adaptation of Gordon Williams' novel) that the 2011 remake is still entertaining despite its numerous shortcomings in both complexity and artistry to its predecessor. Director Rod Lurie's retelling trades conflicted characters and intricate ideals of bravery and cowardice with plain-dealing motives and basic revenge; Peckinpah's flair for operatic visuals is sadly absent. So too is the contemplative nature of the whole affair ? the ambiguity and subtleties within every character's actions have been replaced with spoon-fed notions of right and wrong. It's impossible to avoid comparison to the original film, and doing so would be a disservice to the discerning viewer. Those that loved Peckinpah's creation will likely find little value in Lurie's version, but for those who haven't seen it, the remake does offer a humble taste of the brilliance you're missing out on.Screenwriter David Sumner (James Marsden) and his wife Amy (Kate Bosworth) move to her old hometown of Blackwater, Mississippi with the hopes of peace and quiet so he can write his newest script. When Amy's former boyfriend Charlie (Alexander Skarsgard) and his buddies Bic (Drew Powell), Chris (Billy Lush), and Norman (Rhys Coiro) are hired to repair the Sumners' garage, the bullying of David and unwelcome advances toward Amy begin. As the taunts and threats steadily escalate to a horrific act of violence, David must take a stand and defend his new home with an equal force of savagery.Everything questionable, objectionable and controversial about the original Straw Dogs has been finely filtered out, leaving a straightforward, simple revenge story. None of the artistic violence, symbolic editing or jarring music remains. This update goes so far as to spell out the significance of the title, as well as adding the line "maybe you should wear a bra," which drastically dumbs down the purpose of Amy's appearance. If it weren't for the fact that the target audience is likely to have no knowledge of the 1971 version's existence, this level of defining, dulling and allaying disputatious content would be insulting. Extra references to the predominant themes, such as the inclusion of research on Stalingrad, further add to the intellectual affront.Minor details have changed but the basic ideas are still present. Some of the original dialogue is reused (including snippet jokes that are no longer relevant), several scenes are nearly identical, a few props reappear, and even a couple of camera angles pay homage to Sam Peckinpah's vision. The competition, power struggle, vigilantism, Of Mice and Men subplot, conflict with religion, psychological breaking point examination and underdog vengeance aren't forgotten, however, and it's hard not to admire the cathartic power of the hero rising to the occasion and giving the villains what they so desperately deserve. It's essentially a two-hour, disturbing, suspenseful build to an explosive conclusion ? one that abruptly stops when the last antagonist has fallen. But it's also difficult for Marsden to compete with Hoffman and for director/screenwriter Rod Lurie to match the originality and creativity of Peckinpah's turbulent classic.- The Massie Twins (GoneWithTheTwins.com)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What are You Capable of?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. If you have seen Sam Peckinpah's classic 1971 original with Dustin Hoffman and Susan George, it is impossible to watch this remake without comparing the two films. Because of that, these comments will include some comparative notes. After all, it's been 40 years and most people watching this new version have never seen the original.Director Rod Lurie follows the Peckinpah version pretty closely with the obvious changes being a move from the English countryside to the deep south (Mississippi), and the main characters are now a screenwriter and actress instead of mathematical whiz and ... well, whatever Susan George's character was in the original. Those are the obvious changes, but not the most significant. I really missed the subtlety and psychological trickery delivered by Peckinpah, especially in the relationship between David and Amy.Lurie chooses to take advantage of the physical screen presence of Alexander Skarsgard (True Blood) as Charlie, the local stud and Amy's ex. Charlie's past exploits on the football field and his creepy leadership skills with his posse of thugs, provide the yin of physical strength to the yang of David's intelligence. It's interesting to note that this version spells out Sun-Tzu's description of "straw dogs" while Peckinpah left his audience to fend for themselves. But, of course, what this boils down to is just how far can a civilized person be pushed ... and how far is the bully willing to go? James Woods is a welcome and terrifying addition to the new version. Since it is based in the small town south, high school football must play a role. Woods is the former high school coach who is now a violent drunk, and still leader of his former players. He is a sadistic type who picks on Jeremy Niles (Dominic Purcell), the slow-witted brother of Daniel (Walton Goggins) and constantly accuses him of inappropriate behavior with his 15 year old cheerleader daughter.James Marsden (Hairspray) and Kate Bosworth (Remember the Titans) play David and Amy. They come back to Amy's childhood home so she can rest and David can have some peace and quiet while writing his screenplay on the Battle of Stalingrad. Well, we couldn't really have him writing a rom-com, could we? From Day One, the peace and quiet is clearly missing and Lynyrd Skynyrd wins out over Bach in the battle of radio volume. Tension builds and David is tested daily over what it means to be a man ... tested by the local hicks and doubted by his lovely wife.Things turn from bad to worse when the locals invite David to go hunting with them. What happens with Charlie and Amy during this time changes everything. This sequence was the key to the controversy of the original and what caused it to be banned in many cities and countries. Lurie chooses to handle it in a very straightforward manner - plus, times and mores have changed quite a bit in the last 40 years.For me, the Peckinpah original remains a classic film with brilliant psychological undertones which left me feeling very uncomfortable and questioning what I might do in this situation. Lurie's new version offered little of that but does work fine as a straightforward suspenseful thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong cast - sad remake script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of Alexander Skarsg?rd, I really tried to like the movie - but I just couldn't. If the hushed nature of the theater crowed leaving at the end is any indication - they felt the same way. I feel the cast did well with what they had, but the script was lacking in too many ways. Where the 1971 version had tension and excitement, the 2011 version was often boring and all over the place. I often felt like it was Texas Chainsaw Massacre decided to have a get together with Deliverance and Sweet Home Alabama. The whole thing just felt awkward and thrown together. There were only a handful of scenes where the movie actually had my attention - but they were few and far apart and short lived. There were even moments that were so awkward they were actually uncomfortable. I expected so much more with such a classic movie base and wonderful cast - but ultimately it was disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insulting, as a Remake of Sam Peckinpah's Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The screenwriter David Sumner (James Marsden) travels with his wife Amy (Kate Bosworth) in his Jaguar to her homeland Blackwater, in the Mississippi. Amy's father has passed away and David intends to write his screenplay about Stalingrad in the house. David hires the contractor Charlie (Alexander Skarsg?rd) and his team to repair the roof of the Barn. Amy was the sweetheart of Charlie when she lived there and neither him nor his crew show respect to her. Charlie invites David to hunt deers with his group and him but they leave David alone in the woods and rape Amy. She does not tell to David what happened but when the drunken coach Tom Heddon (James Woods) calls Charlie and his friends to hunt down the slow Jeremy Niles (Dominic Purcell) that likes his daughter, David decides to protect not only Jeremy, but also Amy and his honor."Straw Dogs" is an insulting movie, as a remake of Sam Peckinpah's classic of 1971. The original movie is one of the most disturbing that I have ever seen, with a stylish cinematography, top-notch direction and a scary story. This remake is dull, with stupid situations and non-likable and badly developed characters. My suggestion is, instead of watching this remake, see the 1971 movie again. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "Sob o Domínio do Medo" ("Under the Domination of the Fear")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While there are probably people out there who could pull off a remake of the classic Straw Dogs, this isn't the group.I tried real hard to like this film since I'm a huge fan of Walton Goggins, but this should have been left on the shelf.The actress playing the wife did a rather good job, though, in a role that is not easy to pull off and achieve a believable balance.Overall I wouldn't give this more than about 4 or 5 points.Next time someone tries this I really hope they can give us something worth watching. This is a truly worthwhile script that can be done better, perhaps even better than the original. I'd like to see that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good remake, although not as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected this movie to be yet another terrible remake and turn it off after 15 minutes. But know know what? This was actually a good remake.While the movie is very similar to the original, they did make some small changes here and there, mainly in the characters background and their motivation - which might help explain some things that seemed a bit odd in the original (for example, why would a beautiful blonde marry a geek). Others may claim the writer ruined some ideas.It's hard and unfair to compare the actors' performance to Dustin Hoffman and David Warner in the original, but I have to say that all the cast actually did a decent job. James Woods was excellent as a southern redneck and Kate Bosworth was surprisingly good too. I'm not familiar with any of the other actors, who were all decent in their roles.The ending had some small changes too - again, made in order for the characters to have a better motivation. Still, I prefer the ending of the original, which I recall was more intense and more "surreal", made to show a man protecting his "castle".All in all, this remake is much better than many of the recent remakes I've seen (or chose to skip). Was this remake necessary? Probably not.5/10 Worth watching</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was shocking in 1971 becomes dull in 2011</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reviews here fall into 2 groups: those who've seen the original 1971 version, and those who haven't. The first group review by comparison with what was a shockingly controversial and influential film in its day.But the second group saw the movie without preconceptions, and I'm interested to see they mostly found it dull, boring, slow, pointless and generally unsatisfactory, despite a decent cast and smooth production.So, what was shocking in 1971 is boring to today's audiences? That may be the most shocking thing about this remake. I watched both versions back-to-back to find out for myself, and yes, the original is a good deal more daring (for its time), the retread pulls its punches while otherwise doing a decent job of relocating and updating without changing the story.One other point I notice: the reviewers who know about the location - the US Southern Heartland - are the ones most critical of the way the locals are portrayed.In this I must say the remake more than mirrors the original: Knowing rural England of the 1970s, I found all the local characters very unrealistic and badly acted. I know the original movie is highly acclaimed, but really, the local English actors all came across as bit-players from the old Ealing comedies, middle class city dwelling amateur dramatics types playing at being working class country folk, with dialog and mannerisms that only a foreign director could fail to detect as phony.So, a polished but flawed remake of an unpolished, also flawed, but controversial original. 7/10 for effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE PLOT: A screenplay writer named David Sumner, and his wife, Amy move to a small Mississippi town to temporarily live in a fieldstone house that Amy grew up in. Her parents are dead, and the property has been left unoccupied for a number of years. David and Amy go there to help repair the damages that were done to Amy's family barn due to Hurricane Katrina.Upon arriving there, Amy runs into her ex-boyfriend from high school, Charlie Venner who still clearly has feelings for Amy and is prepared to do anything to get her back. David does not pick up on this sadly, and hires Charlie and his friends to come over to their place, and help fix the roof of the barn that was damaged.Soon, tensions begin to build between the couple and Charlie and his friends.THE CHARACTERS: David Sumner - He is a pacifist, and overall a nice man who doesn't like conflict and is very passive aggressive. While in Mississippi, he is working on his newest screenplay, and hopes staying in a rural area will help leave him undisturbed. When conflict rises between Amy and Charlie, he tries very hard to be a diplomat.Amy Sumner - An ex-cheerleader at the local high school, left for California and has had a little success on a TV show.Charlie and his friends - Typical ex-high school jocks who can't seem to get over the past. They all at different times act very condescending towards David and Amy.Tom Heddon - The ex-coach of the local high school football team. Heddon is the leader of the group of Charlie and his friends who all once played football for him. He has a very bad temper. James Woods plays this role and he steals the show in my view. His performance is amazing. He is down right scary in this movie and made me more uncomfortable then any of the other characters. It's really no wonder Charlie and his friends are so messed up, and have trouble getting over the past because they all look up to Heddon, and he is just as guilty of holding onto the past, and treating life like it's one big football game.MY THOUGHTS:For the most part, I am not a fan of the remakes, but I enjoyed this one. Mostly because I was able to relate to it since it's set in modern times in the United States of America. I'm also from the South, and I know all about how down here, some people try to force hunting, high school football, and church on you. (And yet still sin like Satan.) I also am aware how certain men cannot let go of their high school years.HOW THIS FILM COMPARES TO THE ORIGINAL: What makes this film different then the original film is the main character "David" was not the hero in Sam Peckinpath's film. He was, according to Peckinpah, the bad guy of the movie. In the remake, David is just a good man who is sadly caught between a rock and a hard place, and is just trying to survive. Overall, the remake took out the controversy and gave us a thriller of good vs. evil.WHO I THINK WILL ENJOY THIS FILM: I think this is more of an adult film. People in their late-twenties and up will enjoy it. I also think people who have ever been bullied or made to feel like outsiders will enjoy this film as well. I also think mature adult couples will like it since facing conflict and standing up for your wife sometimes is all apart of having one.WHO I THINK WILL NOT ENJOY THIS FILM: I think some of the testosterone-filled males in the teenage and college crowd, and the young women who love them, as well as the adult children will have trouble getting into this movie because they will be looking for violence, but in this film, the violence builds up. It doesn't just show violence and gore for the sake of it. There's no CGI, no loud music, no fast car chase scenes. Just a classic fish-out-of water story.I think some people who don't like violence in movies should stay away from this one. I think some Christians won't like the movie due to the violence too, and/or some traditional Southerners, and the people who love them, as well as former or current popular high school kids because it portrays them all in a very negative light. It will show a side to them that they will not like, and will not be able to handle.For the most part, movies where high school football is the topic, the characters are presented as cool people, but this film shows how many outsiders view them, and like I typed, some former or current popular kids will have trouble dealing with that, knowing not everyone liked or likes them, and sees them as crazy and violent fanatics.FINAL THOUGHTS: I think the pacing was wonderful. Not too fast, not too slow. I enjoyed the instrumental soundtrack. It has a beautiful, yet chilling sound to it which sums up some parts of the South in my view.In this film, I don't think the lesson was just another "stand up to the bullies" movie. I think the lesson was learning how to accept those that are different from you.</fullReview>

There's a lot i didn't like about this remake. First i didn't like they changed Sumner into a screenwriter instead of a professor, i mean WTH? That's so cliché. And I just think you can't replace Hoffman as the lead and get away with it. He was too good in the original. And Kate bosworth she's all right, I'm a fan of hers, but she's not like amazing for the role. Overall, I think was not needed. It didn't improve upon the original film. It's just roughly the same story, it didn't even have to be called a remake. Humble opinion is it ought not be remade this way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No suspense throughout most of film...we already know what will happen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not really my kind of film...excessive violence. I do like suspense films, however, and in this particular case, I have come to like James Marsden, so I took a chance. I actually felt that the film is better than generally rated. So why did it do so poorly? I think there are two reasons. First, I didn't find Kate Bosworth to be at all an appealing or sympathetic victim in this film. Second, and perhaps more importantly, because this is a remake, we all basically know what's going to happen. There's little or no suspense through almost the entire film (although the climax is a humdinger). There's also at least one significant mistake that damages the plot -- Marsden's wife would know it wasn't hunting season since she was a native...thus making the rape scene something that wouldn't be realistic.Marsden is pretty good here, though this is far from his best effort. To be honest, he has a distinct talent for comedy, and perhaps fits better in that genre, along with romance films.Alexander Skarsg?rd is terrific as the primary villain. And what pecs! James Woods...well, I guess his career must have tanked, because this particular characterization is way below him. He ought to be embarrassed.The rest of the cast do their jobs, though no one is outstanding.I think this film is worth a watch...once...but I hardly think it will be a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underwhelming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...SPOILERS AHEAD...Most of us agree that remakes are a pretty pointless affair. So, in the spirit of this, I am going to add yet another pointless review expressing my disappointment with this insipid remake.It's been a little while since I saw the original, but watching this film, I was startled at how very closely the plot here mirrors the Peckinpah film. Yes, I know it's a remake, but what about adding at least a slightly original twist to the story, other than merely changing the location and our mismatched couple's occupations?This is a competently made film, which is quite a bit pacier than the original, which had a slow-burn pace (which I might, I didn't mind at all). For the remake, it was probably a good idea to boost the pace for modern audiences, and the story generally maintains a good momentum.Performances are decent. It was nice to see James Marsden play against type for a change, but neither he nor Kate Bosworth can match up to Dustin Hoffman and Susan George's complex portrayals in the original film - but then again - this film lacks pretty much all of the nuance, moral ambiguity and confronting themes explored in Peckinpah's film.I'd also like to briefly express my disappointment with James Woods - who yells, swears and fights throughout the film. Yes, okay, he is a redneck alcoholic coach, but this is a film - a little character development would be nice. But then, Woods is probably adequately honouring what was undoubtedly a two- (or one-) dimensional depiction in the script. What a waste of a good actor.When I saw Peckinpah's film, I felt confronted, a little exhilarated (like Hoffman after he gets his bloody revenge during the house siege) and then a little guilty. It is hugely discomforting but also hugely compelling when we see Hoffman's previously mild (repressed) character experience some glee during and after the bloodbath. He is, in the moment, delighted to discover that he can match up to the raw fury of the country lads, before any guilt or self-reproach sets in. No sense of this with in the new film, or perhaps it was too 'subtle' for me to notice.Then there is the infamous rape scene. Watching the remake's 'making of', the producer expressed his disgust at the fact that George's character in the original is shown to experience some element of enjoyment in the rape scene. It makes the original scene repellent indeed, but also very interesting. Peckinpah has depicted the original Amy as quite an immature and fickle young woman, who courts attention, and enjoys it when she receives it - until it goes horribly too far. The new scene is horrible to watch as well - it's quite clear that there is absolutely no element of subtle encouragement from Amy - and while this is true and appropriate, it certainly also makes her character less complex than Amy of the original.Yes, this is a glossy, well-made, and superficial retake on Peckinpah's film.***SPOILER ALERT***Two points I'd quickly like to touch on in closing...1. I did not really appreciate hearing the producer of the new film denigrating Peckinpah's film. For instance, he was critiquing the choice to make David a mathematician in the original film. Apparently the contrast between David and Amy was too extreme. The original was an extreme film (especially when it was released) that wanted to make a strong point about the 'civilized' man's relationship to violence, and it did so in a way that the remake couldn't. 'Rationalising' David's character by making him a screenwriter instead of a mathematician does nothing.2. One review claimed that 'Peckinpah rubbed our noses in the bloodlust. Lurie invites objectivity.' ...Really?The original had some shocking violence, but quite frankly, I was stunned at how much blood and guts splattered across the screen in this remake, or indeed how long the camera lingered closely on Charlie's head after it had been 'bear-trapped'...And WHY THE BLIP did we need to see Jeremy's bone protruding from his forearm after the accident? What does this add...?That's all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Straw Dogs" (1971, the original) is one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen. Having seen it many times before watching the remake, I knew I would be hard to please. The biggest obstacle for me, having seen the original and also being a white Southern male, was the unbelievability and implausibility of the small town henchmen. Simply put, even the drinkingest church goers among us do not "show their behinds" in public the way these buffoons did in the movie. They do not break bottles in the parking lot of the high school football games their very own mamas, pastors, and former coaches attend. They don't so brazenly break hunting regulations. They are not so "lost" in their glory years they would follow their coach into vigilante justice. They just wouldn't, folks. There are just as many bad guys in the South as anywhere else but they don't behave badly in the public of small town Dixie. With only a few changes in the script, the setting and characters could've remained the same and would've been considerably more believable. Forget the Southern stereotypes of football heroes and coaches and make them all blood relatives like the original "Straw Dogs" and I'd be hard-pressed to say white Southern males wouldn't rape and invade a house with no hesitation. But by playing to the stereotypes (and perhaps without even getting a feel for a real Southern community beforehand), the director fails to produce a realistic menace with at least the Southern demographic of his audience. The original movie "works" mainly because the henchmen feel foreign and scary. The remake fails because its counterparts don't ring true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>another disappointing remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rod Lurie made a name for himself when he burst on to the scene in 2000, with the political thriller The Contender and then followed that up a year later with the very under rated The Last Castle. Lurie then did some TV work, before returning to the big screen in 2008 with Resurrecting the Champ, followed by Nothing But the Truth. Unfortunately, Lurie's most recent directorial effort, a remake of the 1971 film Straw Dogs starring Dustin Hoffman and Susan George, is a far cry from the well written, well directed earlier four films.Lurie's Straw Dogs stars James Marsden as screenplay writer David Sumner and Kate Bosworth as his wife, Amy Sumner. Marsden's David is a borderline geek lacking what it takes to be a man, which Marsden plays convincingly well. Marsden has never struck me as someone tough or able to defend himself. I hated him as Cyclops in the X-Men films, and found that he was better suited to movies like Enchanted and 27 Dresses. Bosworth's Amy, however, comes across as a woman better suited to put up a fight if need be. Bosworth's performance is one of the better parts of the movie. Alexander Skarsg?rd, best known as playing Eric Northman in the HBO hit series True Blood, plays Charlie Venner. Charlie is Amy's ex-boyfriend and leader of the group of rednecks that cause trouble for the Sumners. I like Skarsg?rd on True Blood and think that with quality writing he is capable of giving a solid performance. In Straw Dogs, Skarsg?rd just wastes away due to the character being seriously under developed. James Woods plays the drunken, over protective Tom Heddon, ex-head coach of the local football. Woods is the best thing about the film and his performance stands out as such.As a thriller, Straw Dogs was terribly disappointing and could have been a lot better, had it had a better script and director; Lurie also wrote the screenplay. The pacing of the film left much to be desired, as often times it felt as if the story was dragging. The characters needed better development and the violence should have been more brutal; although the finale does include a pretty violent death. The underlining message of the film seemed to be that people got what they deserved; regardless of whether they were asking for it or not. That must mean that viewers deserved to waste their time and money, because that's exactly how I felt after watching this.Grade: D+ visit our site at www.twodudereview.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made of Straw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Straw Dogs sets a nice table, but when the main course comes out you're trying figure out why the turkey is half frozen, there's no dressing, and only half the veggies were prepared.David is a writer who moves with his wife to her hometown so that they can repair her family's barn and he can work on his latest film script. Trouble brews with the locals from the start, and we quickly learn that David does not handle conflict well. He is passive-aggressive, a coward, and has morphing morals that seem to apply to total strangers but not his wife.The climax is a rape scene, not the assault on the house. However, the rape scene adds zero energy to the conclusion since Amy never tells David what happened. Rather, it is the protection of a stranger that gets picked on by the townsfolk that David decides to defend, instead of his wife, that leads to the epic battle seen in the trailer.This film is an example of how not to film and edit a movie. The storyline lacks connection, using none of the fire-starters at its disposal, and leaves a plethora of plot devices open, causing you to wonder why they were included in the first place.David's motivations do not make him a sympathetic character, and his reasons for standing behind his convictions do not show that he has gained any better understanding of who he is, nor does it show any growth in him since he gunned down a buck at fairly close range, so you already know that there is a killer instinct in him. Oddly, David hunting the deer is juxtaposed with the rape of his wife. So while David wrestles with whether or not he is going to pull the trigger, Charlie and Norman take turns with Amy. Why? What do these two scenes have in common, or how do they critique, comment, or form a metaphor for one another? The questions and more are left scattered across the movie theater as David stands outside his demolished home as the ambulance is arriving. As an audience you are left wondering why Amy didn't say anything, are they ever going to find the missing girl they were searching for, and how do these actions link with the conclusion? If you decide to watch this movie, do it with the lights out, the sound up, and your brain off. Understand that it will be uncomfortable for your lady friend when the rape scene unfolds. And, again, try not to think too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>!!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!!! The original movie has the dubious label of being a "Classic Movie" . To be honest much of its reputation is down to a notorious rape scene . That said Peckinpah was a genuine auteur who grabbed Hollywood by the throat , stuck a gun in its mouth and blew its head off . Hollywood was never the same again and it's interesting seeing some of his style recreated to a degree via Scorsese , Verhoeven , DePalma and Tarantino , directors who don't do things by half when a scene calls for literal bloody violence . Regardless of that STRAW DOGS isn't a great movie , having a rather confused story where a middle class non violent man and his slutty wife have to make a stand when their lives are threatened . If you liked the Peckinpah style you would have no doubt liked STRAW DOGS flaws and all but it seems totally pointless continuing the recent Hollywood trend and remaking horror films from the 1970S and 80s especially when absolutely nothing new is brought to the table and I had this down as yet another production line number with the setting moved from Cornwall England to the American Deep South . Add to this looking through his resume on this site remake director Rod Laurie is obviously a journeyman type of film maker and nothing he's directed ring any bells with me I really must do the lottery sometime because everything I predicated was indeed correct and almost everything wrong with the original is recreated here with added dog poo . The couple of Amy and David was highly unlikely in the 1971 due to the casting but here it's even more unconvincing . David is a Hollywood screenwriter and one of the things that's always appealed to me on an abstract level is that Beverly Hills must be a great place to meet really hot chicks . Is trailer trash Amy really the best David could pull ? I know a lot of men have a fetish for plain faced , sexually easy , peroxide blonds but there's a large difference between having sex with one and getting married to one .There's also a very mall detail in that his screen writing project lacks credibility . Hollywood is doing a big budget war film featuring Stalingrad as the backdrop ! Yeah sure they are . When something does ring true like the Deep South having more than its fair share of bible bashing rednecks everything is so over done as to lapse in to parody . It also begs the question why would anyone want to return there if they can live in Beverly Hills ? "Okay Theo is there anything about this remake that improves on the original" Yes it gives an explanation why the film is called STRAW DOGS and the anal rape scene is slightly less distasteful than what we got in the original . Oh what a short paragraph I've just written</fullReview>

It's out of time (technologie, social realities, etc..)The good thing about this film, was that i didn't see the first one. So after coming back from the restaurant with my wife. We settled the kids with "just dance", and we watched that movie.We had a good time.Of course, it is not a life changing film. We will not think about it for a few days. But, it was a well made film, well acted (not B style, nor Oscar) and it was entertaining.It is stereotyped, unimaginative, but in the end, it is well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Straw Dogs - not very good at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A screenwriter, David Sumner (James Mardsen, Death at a Funeral), and his wife Amy (Kate Bosworth, 21) move back to her small Southern hometown, where tensions build with them an a few locals.Not a horrid work by Rod Lurie, but not any close to good, either. When I watch a gritty film like this, I like to be both entertained and disturbed, but I was more disturbed by this film. Some of the confrontations between Charlie (Alexander Skarsgard, TV's True Blood) and David are just silly and random attempts to add to the creepiness of the film. It had some pretty solid performances (Skarsgard, Woods) but it just did not do very much for me. The original film has Dustin Hoffman, so I'd be interested to see that little guy crack. That one I'd be pleased to add to my film collection. I'm glad I found this one on TV, saved me about twenty bucks. After I watch the original, I don't think I'd be surprised to conclude that this film didn't do it any justice at all. VERDICT: 55/100</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything disturbingly... out of place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must start by saying that i'm not sure that even if i saw the original i would like the plot. The whole story is perfectly underlined by the summary, there's nothing more to add to that. So part of my bad rating is because of the plot itself. The rest is because, in my opinion, everything was either badly performed or completely out of place. And i explain : 1) Atmosphere : it felt more like a road movie (without the shaking camera and with better make-up) rather than a thriller. The movie makers failed completely to achieve this dark full-of-anxiety atmosphere needed for a good thriller. I'm not sure if it was bad photography or bad directing though 2) The "flow" : one of the major problems was that there was a total absence of emotional flow in the movie. Usually, when you're watching a captivating story, you start from very low in the emotional ladder and the feelings escalate (mixing horror with hope or other beautiful feelings at some point so the contrast will be shown in a better way) up to a highest point, a peek and from that point and beyond since the story has reached its worst point, things can only go better, so the audience gets the feeling of relief. In my opinion that's the artistic value of a horror/thriller movie, this emotional roller-coaster that strangely enough makes you realize that you feel better when you leave the cinema. The problem with this movie was that (leaving out a very small first/introductory part) you get the same feelings, the same level of anxiety throughout the whole movie. And it's kind of disturbing that you can see the story escalating, but the atmosphere and the feelings it invokes, never do. Even the famous (as i was told) rape scene, just "passed by". In the first part of the scene there was a good idea, a twist that could be really used as a lever to dramatically change the atmosphere in the second part (which could serve as a peek of the story, since it's the turning point for the female character), but instead it led to total failure with a second part (of the same seen) that reminded me of old movies where sexual scenes where censored and the camera would zoom to a lamp or a candle near by.3) Acting : this is the part to which my comment "out of place" mostly refers. So, we have three main characters who play in so different ways that seem like they're playing in different versions of the movie. The actor who portrayed David is the only one who fits-in almost perfectly to the scenery. The actress portraying the female character is playing the role as if Amy were a hysterical woman. She fails to deliver the building anxiety in her since she performs the same way from the beginning to the end of the movie and at most parts she is overacting to a very disturbing point. Last, the character portraying Charlie was the biggest disappointment. The problem with him, was that he performs in a very delicate European way, which on one hand was in total contrast with everybody else (who were acting in the traditional -outrageous- American way), in contrast with the scenery, in contrast with his americanized looks and accent and on the other hand made the character look too delicate (even gentle) to be a threatening/potential-killer country-man. I think he would have been perfect if this movie was a European remake (where anxiety escalates through silence instead of big booms, and threatening people slowly appear through the shadows, instead of jumping in front of women and growl), but in this movie his acting was totally out of place with everybody else and it didn't work. And it's really a shame to think that the one who's performing the best way is the one who causes the most problems because of the contrast with other people's acting and the absence of the appropriate atmosphere; it's a shame to think that the only way this movie could kind of work it would be if he would overact too :-S</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same difference</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The director tries to convince the audience that his movie is so much different than the Peckinpah version (=original). But for all his effort that he puts into it (too much, especially in the audio commentary), he only seems to be able to convince himself of it. The one scene with the female lead that sparked a big controversy with the original movie, isn't that different when it "starts". It actually almost has the same vibe, before it turns (for obvious reasons).While I admire the directors passion for his positive outlook, it didn't translate well onto the screen. The story itself though is strong enough to hold this together and make it a movie that can be watched (especially if you're not into watching "older" movies). Still I would recommend you watch the original. And if this movie sort of achieved one thing, it did bring the spotlight back on the original (for a new generation I guess)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A weak remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Setting the film in the USA was the first mistake, none of the main characters were strong compared to the original particularly Marsden and Bosworth. Why remake a film, renowned for its graphic violence, and then tame out all the violence - politically correctness? Not seen to be too keen on the rape? Whatever, morals are one thing but why castrate the movie? It's like depicting the life of Christ but missing out the crucifixion. Absolutely not a patch on the original who's setting and cast were perfect. Susan George in the role of Amy - how can that be ever bettered? Hoffman as the initially weak husband who turns into a hero - just magnificent. If you've not watched this new version, don't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Straw Dogs is a remake of an old film from the 70's which starred Dustin Hoffman, it's a film I haven't seen but I have heard a lot about it, particularly the violence and the rape scene. After watching this boring 2 hours of film it does kind of make me want to see the original material and hopefully it will maybe change my mind about the story a tad.The drawing point of this movie for me was James Marsden, he is probably my favorite male actor, everything I've seen him in I've really enjoyed, he's s very talented actor and a pure pleasure to watch, and really he is the only great thing about this film, he puts in a decent performance of a man pushed to breaking point, besides that there's really nothing else to talk about. The rest of the actors are terrible, the plot is far too slow paced and the pay off comes far too late in the film, in the end I hated the Kate Bisworth character, I thought she was just a selfish woman, and yes I understand she was raped but I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks that rape scene was more just like a sex scene. Silly. And I think the whole sub plot with the develop mentally delayed guy was just stupid and totally out of place.There are a lot worse films you could waste your money on, but still, If the premise of this film interests you I would recommend the two remakes of either I Spit On Your Grave or The Last House On The Left, they are both far more superior and are much more entertaining. Straw dogs will basically just leave you dissatisfied.</fullReview>

From the idiot husband, to the ever so random angry coach, to the completely unnecessary explicit rape scene, there was not one decent moment in this film. It was a total disaster! It felt like it just drug on for hours before finally getting to the point. And when it did, it definitely just led to disappointment.

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the original not because it came out first, but the direction quality was 10 X better! First of all it was Dustin Hoffman, enough said. That it was set in an English country side vs the rural south. The plots for both were essentially the same but there were enough twists in the remake to contrast the two films. Unfortunately those factors all play in the lesser entertainment value of the remake. The characters lacked personification and just didn't stand out well enough. Actually they were all stereotypical, all the way down to the sheriff. Although James Woods certainly is a classic actor, his role seemed underplayed given his acting ability. There were some good parts to the remake, such as the scene prior to and after the football game. I suppose if the remake was the original, then it would be a better movie. If you only saw the remake, do yourself a favor and see classic Sam P. direction.</fullReview>

It is a very entertaining film with a stunning end, good direction by Rod Lurie and very competent performers among which a magnificent James Marsden and Kate Bosworth excellent. Does not reach the height of the great Sam Peckinpah film but no doubt that is a remarkable product of good cinema with a violent, bloody, brutal but performed far end job."Straw Dogs" is a remarkable rehabilitation of a classic film. We must not qualify the film as compared to the original Sam Peckinpah , because comparisons always tend to leave the model stops better movies. But I must say that this film is a very interesting exercise in thriller, human degradation, an example of the conflict between town and country, and if you will between civilization and barbarism.Technically it is filmed with great skill, and director Rod Lurie has nothing to envy to the mythical Peckinpah , because I think he gives us the size and provides a striking and well shot images , filled with many moments of visual metaphors parallel scenes .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine as a standalone, but you'll wonder why they bothered as a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most modern remakes carry with them a whiff of disappointment, a general feeling of déj? vu and a sense that watching is time wasted because they're invariably going to be worse than the original (apart from in a few instances). The same can well be said of STRAW DOGS, a film that relocates Sam Peckinpah's controversial classic in the southern USA but otherwise tells exactly the same story, with the same sequences and even the same dialogue beats.Put simply, STRAW DOGS is a fine enough film in itself and would be more impressive if the original didn't exist. Compared to the original, it comes second in every way; the cast is a lot worse, the direction is non-existent compared to Peckinpah's masterful stylistics, and the power is just lacking. Fans of the original would do better to stick with that because there's no way this film has a hope of coming close to it.Taken as a standalone movie, though, and compared to other modern thrillers, it turns out to be?well, not bad. The slow-building plot is as effective as ever, and the climax doesn't disappointment when it arrives and unleashes a wave of violence upon the screen. James Marsden struggles because you can't help but compare him to Dustin Hoffman in the role, and Kate Bosworth doesn't really capture that level of coquettishness that the Susan George character had, either.But the supporting players are better, and Alexander Skarsgard is particularly sinister as the bad guy who doesn't really do anything all that bad ? although we hate him anyway. James Woods ignites the screen, as ever, and Dominic Purcell offers a completely different performance to David Warner's, so his role is all the better for it.So what we have here is a film that can be taken in two different ways. As a remake, it's a pale effort compared to the vibrant original. As a standalone movie, it's a pretty tense thriller with a gripping storyline. I liked it enough the first time around, but is it worth a rewatch? Not like the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inferior but exciting remake about a writer and his wife are threatened by hooligans locals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Modern remake from Sam Peckinpah's 1971 controversial shocker in which Dustin Hoffman, who starred in , and famously disliked, the original film, gave filmmaker Rod Lurie his blessing . Released i almost 40 years to the day of the original 1971 version, which came out November 3 1971 . It deals with L.A. screen writer David Sumner (James Marsden) relocates with his wife (Kate Bosworth) to her hometown in the deep South. When they return to her ancestral village tensions build between them, a brewing conflict with locals (Rhys Coiro, Billy Lush and led by Alexander Skarsg?rd as Charlie) becomes a threat to them both. Meanwhile David is working on a story about Stalingrad (the book is early in the movie is 'Stalingrad' by Anthony Beevor). There her former boyfriends become resentful , jealous and desirous of her , as she taunts them with her wealth and nudism and she is viciously attacked . As the marriage is bullied and taken advantage of by the locals (in original rendition were played by Ken Hutchinson, David Warner , Peter Vaughan , Del Henney) hired to do construction. When David finally takes a stand it escalates quickly into a bloody battle as the locals assault his house . David whose pacifism is put to supreme test attempts to protect a dim-witted man (Dominic Purcell) who is suspected of disappearance and molesting a young girl (Willa Holland) , his house is put under siege by the incensed villagers , but David defends the mansion with ferocity .New but inferior version version about one of the most controversial violence-themed pictures of its day ; dealing with a known plot , as a young American and his wife come to rural little town and face increasingly vicious local harassment. The film, a remake of the controversially violent 1971 movie, is considered fairly faithful to Sam Peckinpah's original, though the location has been moved from Cornwall, England to the U.S. Mississippi Gulf Coast, and the hero's profession has been changed from an intellectual mathematician to screenwriter . The title comes from the Chinese philosopher Lao-tzu, who wrote, "Heaven and earth are not humane, and regard the people as straw dogs, " Straw dogs were used as ceremonial objects for religious sacrifices in ancient China. The picture is as violent as the first version , in fact, because of its graphic portrayal of violence and two brutal rapes, the British Board of Film Censors banned the film from being released on video from 1984 until 2002. The highly charged sequences of carnage in the conclusion make this a controversial movie similarly to original picture .The motion picture was professionally directed by Rod Lurie though with no originally , resulting to be a simple copy from Peckinpah flick , being equally based on the novel "The Siege of Trencher's Farm" by Gordon Williams , including screenplay by David Goodman and the same Peckinpah. Rod is a talented film critic-turned-director who burst onto the scene in late 2000 with his hotly debated political thriller ¨The contender¨. After writing some scripts , Lurie was already hard at work at his next film, working with his acting hero Robert Redford. The result was the 2001 action/drama ¨The last castle ¨ (2001). It centered on an imprisoned military general, forced to go up against a tyrannical prison warden . He subsequently directed ¨Resurrecting the champ¨ and ¨Nothing but the truth¨, both of them were commercial failures despite some favorable reviews as well as ¨Straw Dogs¨.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How far can a civilized man be pushed?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's the question explored in this 2011 remake of Sam Peckinpah's film of 40 years prior. The location has been changed from the English countryside to the deep south of coastal Mississippi (although shot in Louisiana), but the plot is the same: A well-to-do couple from L.A. move back to the wife's hometown and settle into the now vacant homestead. James Marsden plays the screen writing husband and Kate Bosworth his wife. They enlist some roofers whom she knows from her high school days, the leader being 6'4" Alexander Skarsg?rd, a former boyfriend of Kate's character. Rivalry is in the air as he subtly tries to emasculate Kate's brainy husband and she starts to question his manhood. Havoc ensues.Although I'm well familiar with Peckinpah and his Westerns, I've never seen the original version of "Straw Dogs" so I'm basing this review solely on this version without comparisons to Peckinpah's original.This is a psychological-thriller and so there's a lot of drama and subtle suspense build-up; things don't blow-up until the final act, so to speak. Consequently, anyone looking for mindless action should stay away. Those who enjoy films shot in the deep South, like "Deliverance," "Squirm," "The General's Daughter," "Undertow," "The Man in the Moon," "Ode to Billy Joe (1976)" and the remake of "Cat People" will likely appreciate this new version of "Straw Dogs" (I wasn't joking about including "Squirm," btw). There are also similarities to "Of Mice and Men," like the mentally challenged guy who doesn't know his own strength.The conflict here is basically brawn vs. brain or Lynyrd Skynyrd vs. Bach. Some have complained that Marsden was wrong for the role of the husband since it called for more of a wimpy nerd like Dustin Hoffman in the original, but I thought Marsden was excellent in the part. This is a totally civilized man of average stature (5'10") with an intellectual occupation who is forced to shed all his civilized conditioning and revert back to the barbarism of his ancestors. The role didn't require some uber-dweeb.Bosworth, however, doesn't fit the role of the sultry wife who wows all the guys around her simply because she's too thin and un-curvy. She's good-looking, she just needs to gain about 12-15 lbs. to pull off a hottie. Take, for instance, the flashing from the window scene: It just doesn't work with Bosworth.After the film I felt dubious about some of the character's actions in the story: Why does a rape-victim keep silent? Why on earth is the popular high school cheerleader interested in the local mentally-challenged hunk? Why does the ex-coach hate this poor sob and why is he so rash? Etc. A little reflection will answer these and other questions. If you're having trouble figuring them out simply go to the IMDb message board for answers. In any event, I like it when films don't spell everything out and make you think.FINAL WORD: It's nothing outstanding, but if you appreciate Southern Gothic or Rural Gothic, regardless of genre (drama, adventure, horror, thriller), this 2011 version of "Straw Dogs" is effective enough. It forces you to think and glean answers. I should add that there's a hard-to-watch rape scene and at least one other sexually suggestive scene (where you can't make anything out, but you know what's going on), not to mention the mayhem of the climax, but it's mostly an intelligent drama that slowly builds tension. Unfortunately, Bosworth is miscast and there's a feeling of unreality to some of the proceedings, indicating that kinks needed to be worked out in the script.The film runs 110 minutes.GRADE: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has a better build up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a alright remake although the original is more gritty and brutal. But wasn't a worldwide hit or anything, perhaps because the story takes place in England. This one takes place in the south with very stereotypical rednecks and hillbillies. There has been movies about brutal murders and mutant hillbillies that kill people that goes in a bit of a stretch. But this one goes in a more humanistic and a bit of psychological direction that the original "Straw Dogs" was known for. James Marsden takes the lead role this time as David Sumner not Scott Summers. Dustin Hoffman in the original "Straw Dogs" played the role as a very wimpy character that gets pushed to the edge. But the way James Marsden play it or how his character is written. His character is more pedantic than a wimp and just tries to avoid confrontations at all cost. Because he just doesn't want to deal with it. So Dustin Hoffman's version of the character is more likable. In fact none of the characters in this movie is likable and has some flaws even if they aren't the villains in this movie. But I guess that gives it more of the humanistic approach for a movie like this. Alexander Skarsg?rd actually makes a better leader of the pack of hillbillies. Although the original is more gritty and brutal I thought the build up for this movie was done better. Especially how it explains and shows the meaning behind "Straw Dogs" which wasn't really done in the original. And the siege at the end when compared to the original seemed more like pressure than tension. This movie is basically all about wrong timing. How the protagonist doesn't stand up for himself all the way through which probably escalates the problem and when he decides to fight the problem escalates even more. The original seemed like bullies picking on someone weaker but I didn't really get that feeling with this one but felt slight bit more psychological aspect to it. When it comes to the character Amy Sumner played by Kate Bosworth in this is bipolar or something cause her actions don't make much sense. So when the hillbilly workers come inside the house uninvited goes through their fridge and sit in there home without permission it's okay. But when they check her out while she is running with almost the bare minimum when it comes to running clothes she freaks out. Overall the build up is slightly better than the original but when it comes to everything else the original seem to have the upper-hand.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing But Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never viewed the original, so for better or worse I could not use it as a measure. I came in watching the film without any knowledge of its plot except that it was a suspenseful horror flick. What I found was both intriguing and disappointing. The movie brings a level of suspense and fear that so encompasses the 60's/ 70's horror-torture genre. The intensity of the rape scene, while difficult to watch, brings a sharp level of artisanship rarely visibly in modern day horror films. The dynamic relationship between David Summer and his Amy and the interloper Charles is chilling and awkwardly amusing. Those are the pluses. Beyond that, it over and over again fails in execution. The portrayal of the townies and yuppies (red staters v. blue staters) was completely juvenile and even laughable which I suspect was not the intent of the director. Then the film ends with ... well ... a thud. The final home invasion, the main event, seems utterly botched. Too many minuses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could've had a better plot basis.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was good. But that's all it was. I liked the whole 'crazy locals - hillbilly - cult' idea but it was quite recycled. There seemed to be two main plots when the movie only needed one. The overall message of the movie was a competition for superior masculinity and standing up to the bullies. The movie also had some good death scenes and kick-ass moments but there's nothing more to say about it. I think this movie is suitable for people slightly older than me (I'm 19) and people who favour serious movies. The acting was adequate and for the first movie I've seen Kate Bosworth in, I'm not impressed. The only bit I really liked was Aleksander Skarsgard's body.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pale rendition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This inferior remake has a rather strong cast and serviceable performances, especially by James Woods as a truly sadistic ex-football coach, but manages to take the moral ambiguities of the original and dumb them down exponentially, rendering the formerly provocative, thought provoking original version of the film into a much more cut and dried, black and white rape/revenge film. If "the Contender" caused me to question if Rod Lurie could handle morale complexities with its good and evil view of politics, than this film all but confirmed that notion. This movie is soulless, meandering and can't help but vastly pale in comparison</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad remake at all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There will be those who slam this as a poorly-made remake of Sam Peckinpah's 1971 original and claim that it misses the point altogether, but that's simply not true. This film is actually pretty good. James Woods helps out quite a bit in the role of the old man who eggs it all on, but all the performances are solid. I live in the South (not the DEEP South, but...) and I promise you the characters are right on the money. Actually, in this version, the transformation of the main character is a bit more believable than Dustin Hoffmann's original. You don't go from Marshmallow to the Terminator as Hoffmann did and in this version, there's a bit of "tense" in the main character that makes his eruption more believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tolerable remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cerebral David and his pretty wife Amy move to a remote farmhouse in the rural backwater of Amy's youth so that David can work in peace and quiet. Right from the start there is an uneasy atmosphere deriving from the crew of workmen who are repairing the neighbouring barn roof, led by Charlie, an old flame of Amy's. Amy's provocative dress and behaviour serve to further inflame the situation, but David is inclined to avoid confrontation, even going so far as to go hunting with the men (at which point Charlie and another one of the men take the opportunity to rape Amy). However, when David and Amy give shelter to a local retarded man who has killed a precocious teenager, and the girl's bigwig father leads Charlie and crew to demand his release, David determines to make a stand.This plot summary is exactly the same for Peckinpah's original movie as well as this remake: in truth, the mechanics of the story have hardly changed.But much else has. The move from the autumn chill of rural Cornwall to the steamy heat of backwater Mississippi makes a massive difference in the feel of the movie. And, less obviously, 2011 is very different from 1971 - yes, Kate Bosworth's sweaty and bra-less jogging T-shirt is indeed provocative but, in the present day, it is far less provocative than Susan George's coquettish displays of 40 years ago.The character dynamics are different. Alexander Skarsgard's Charlie has inside him someone who thinks he is good and, perhaps, often tries to be, as opposed to Del Henney's Charlie, who was simply thuggish. Also, Peter Vaughan's bullying local bigwig is a million miles away from James' Wood's Coach who is entertainingly and hysterically psycho, albeit perhaps a little too far in that direction to be wholly believable. And James Marsden plays the passive side of David well, but he always strikes you as someone who is far more likely to be able to look after himself than the diminutive and nerdy Duston Hoffman.What this film does is redecorate the room. It was always a good room, and now it looks different. Not better, not worse, but different.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great all around movie in its own right. It was very unpredictable, the directing was good, the casting couldn't have been much better, the acting was great and the conflict was strong and ongoing. I did't see the original, but I can't imagine it being much better than this remake. This version is very unpredictable and suspenseful. You might not like it if you've seen the original, because it is a suspense movie and knowing what happens kind of ruins it. It has great character development and surprisingly good acting. I was sitting on the edge of my seat for the last 30 minutes of the movie; This is a must-see if you haven't yet seen the original version.</fullReview>

They are rich and show it.She obviously used to put herself out a bit when she lived there before because her and the bloke from True Blood have longing looks.Soon they are taking advantage of Cyclops by playing music early and drinking his beer (the rotters!!).And there is also a sub plot involving James Woods being drunk, and trying to protect er daughter (who is also putting herself out a bit) from the bloke who played another vampire in Blade: Trinity.The tag-line 'everyone has their breaking point' has no real meaning to this movie. from Marsdens point of view, all they are doing is nicking his beer and playing loud music.At the end of the film, they are only trying to get in his house, because he is protecting the guy from James woods and the others.The original has tension and a moody, glum feel to it. This has Bosworth just being annoying and unfortunately, come the end f the film you think to yourself 'you had it coming woman, and why didn't he just leave her?'.It's worthless stuff, sub-plots are not resolved, and aside from some good performance from all involved, it just seems so unnecessary.I'm sure Woods must have been method acting, it's the only explanation as to why he'd be in thisAt least the bear trap came into good use..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impefect Remake Of Peckinpah's Nightmarish Classic--But I've Seen Much Worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would appear that in the 21st century, everything old is new again. And perhaps nowhere is that more true than in Hollywood. Whether it is in remakes or sequels, Hollywood has this way of repeating itself. As a result, it seems most unsettling that one of the films from the past that should be remade for a 21st century audience would be a film that, when released near the end of 1971, caused extreme uproar because of its explicit violence and sexual material. The film in question is director Sam Peckinpah's controversial shocker STRAW DOGS, which remains, alongside Stanley Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, among the most hotly debated films of its time or any time in history. For whatever reason, though, Hollywood thought it needed an updating, and so former film critic turned director/screenwriter Rod Lurie stepped into the shoes of "Bloody Sam" to do it.Following both the film's original source material (Gordon M. Williams' 1969 novel "The Siege Of Trencher's Farm") and the 1971 screenplay written by David Zelag Goodman and Peckinpah, this particular version was moved from the original's setting on the Cornwall coast of England to a backwater town somewhere along the Mississippi/Louisiana border. James Marsden takes on the role of David Sumner (played by Dustin Hoffman in 1971), who has come to this small Southern town with his wife Amy (Kate Bosworth, taking over for Susan George) to work on a movie screenplay based on the 1943 battle of Stalingrad. And as it so happens, his seeming demure nature puts the redneck boys down there in the position of superiority over him, first when Bosworth's pet cat is found strangled in the closet, then, to make matters even more sinister, when Bosworth is raped by her former boyfriend (Alexander Skarsgard) and another man (Rhys Coiro).Marsden, however, comes to his senses when he takes in the local mental invalid (Dominic Purcell) who has unintentionally strangled the daughter (Willa Holland) of the town's ex-football coach (James Woods). Woods, Coiro, and Skarsgard show up on Marsden's property and brutally demand that Purcell be handed over to them, but Marsden, knowing fully well what will happen to him, Purcell, and Bosworth, does no such thing. The end result is ultra-violent mayhem in the film's last twenty minutes.Lurie, who made two of the best films of the year 2000 (DETERRENCE; THE CONTENDER) likely set himself up for a fall in trying to tone down the most objectionable parts of the Peckinpah original that made it, in the eyes of some, a "fascist" work of art: the rape scene, which is a bit too quickly done and a bit too aimed to show Bosworth as a feminist, though she is every bit as traumatized as George was in the original; and unwisely discounting the idea posited by Peckinpah, and based on the works of noted anthropologist Robert Ardrey, that Man's penchant for brutality and violence, far from the common notion that they would go to any means to protect their "property", is ingrained in him from the start. The other thing that is objectionable about this new version of STRAW DOGS is that, unlike the English village where Peckinpah sees the seemingly primitive villagers as every bit the match for Hoffman, the ones in this small Southern town are the unfortunate stereotypical inbred rednecks, especially Woods, who, normally a solid actor, is allowed by Lurie to overact outrageously. And the siege, though fairly well staged, is nevertheless so hyper-violent that the audience becomes a tad bit detached, instead of really being forced to confront their inner demons, as Hoffman's character, and to a great extent Peckinpah himself, did in the original film. Whereas Peckinpah was deliberately ambiguous and thought provoking, and not just a blood-and-guts expert, Lurie makes the mistake of trying to wrap everything up in a neat, albeit very bloody package.Nevertheless, despite these flaws that keep Lurie's film from reaching the nightmarish heights of Peckinpah's, the 2011 STRAW DOGS features solid enough performances from Marsden and Bosworth, who are able to capture the psychological torment that their characters feel. They are still in the shadow of what Hoffman and George did in 1971, but they are able to bring a certain kind of resolve and emotional gravitas to the situation that Lurie doesn't always provide in his direction or script. Larry Groupe's score, though distractingly loud at times (this in contrast to the subtlety of the original film's excellent Jerry Fielding score), also works in those moments where it's supposed to. The end result is, like many remakes, rather imperfect. Still, there have been far worse remakes that Hollywood has done, and will yet do.</fullReview>

None of us could remember the last time we had seen a movie so we despised so much. There was no plot development, you don't get to know any of the characters, and all in all, it was just plain and dull from beginning to end. Even in the ending where the action kind of picks up a little, I suppose, the conclusion was aaaaawful, I tried to appreciate it in a tormented "Funny Games" kind of way, and I just couldn't do it.

		<shortDescription>Straw Dogs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 1971 Sam Peckinpah version was considered at the time one of the most controversial films ever, it was both odd and interesting to see that there was a remake exactly forty years later, directed by Rod Lurie (The Last Castle). Basically screenwriter David Sumner (James Marsden) and his wife Amy (Kate Bosworth) have travelled in his Jaguar to Amy's hometown of Blackwater, Mississippi to rebuild and move into the house of her father who has recently passed away. David intends to write his screenplay about Stalingrad while the work on the house goes on, he hires contractor Charlie (True Blood's Alexander Skarsg?rd) and his team of friends, Norman (Rhys Coiro), Chris (Billy Lush) and Bic (Drew Powell), to repair the roof. Amy was formerly Charlie's sweetheart when she lived in the town, neither him or his crew show any respect towards her, she has a few quarrels with David, as he is concerned she is showing herself up in front of the men, one day she retaliates by lifting her part and exposing herself to them. David is invited by Charlie to go hunting with his group for deer, in fact this was a ploy for the gang to leave him stranded in the woods, while they go back to the house and rape Amy. When David does return home Amy does not tell him what happened, but drunken former football coach Tom Heddon (James Woods) calls Charlie and his friends to hunt down Jeremy Niles (Dominic Purcell), who has an intellectual disability, and has affection Heddon's fifteen-year-old daughter Janice (Willa Holland). David decides to protect Jeremy in the house, obviously he is protecting Amy, but also his own honour, desperate times call for desperate measures as they are trapped inside the house by Charlie, Heddon and the gang who have turned aggressive, the end sees all gang members killed in nasty ways, Charlie has his head ensnared in a bear trap, David, Amy and Jeremy leave lost for words. Also starring Laz Alonso as John Burke and The Hateful Eight's Walton Goggins as Daniel Niles. Marsden and Bosworth cannot compare to the more believable Dustin Hoffman and Susan George, only Skarsg?rd and Woods are alright among the nasty bozo buddies, the plot follows roughly the same story as the original, only relocating from rural England to redneck America, only problem it feels like a lazy effort to recreate what we've already seen, yes it is more gory towards the end, but the synonymous rape scene and violence are no longer shocking, definitely stick to the original, this is a pretty dull and boring psychological thriller remake. Adequate!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well worth seeing - amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There aren't that many films that I would give full marks to but this has to be one of them. Some unusual things happen while you're watching this movie. First there's the story that you're watching unfold in front you and then there's another story running along side it that reminds you of lots of other similar stories of characters being tested. Then there's the story in your own mind revealing itself in response to what you're seeing. The story certainly makes you think, its not passive viewing by any means. For quite a long time I felt myself getting more and more upset with the tone of foreboding. I kept asking myself if I could withstand what I was about to see. Then you realise its not so much about the characters dealing with their problems, its about you and how you would deal with the prospect of this kind of menace. So very rarely as happens in films, you find yourself in the action, in the story and the 'you' in the story is doing exactly what the male protagonist does.There's a tipping point in the processing of events, that switches all of the choices and threats from being extraneous, to intimate and very personal. If that shift is communicated in the original book or if its Sam Peckinapah's contribution I don't know, but its rare all the same. Lots of films try to do it, but most fail. It could be that I've been reading too much about human evolution lately and how we are all essentially still just another species of animal on this earth struggling to survive, I don't know? But the idea that there's a desert island and beautiful tree with one perfect branch and two birds sit on the branch and fight till the death for the right to sit there, is the same for every single living thing. Whether we like it or not. Competition, greed, supremacy and the quest for ownership, however temporary, are everywhere, in all species. I do think though that the notion of choice is something that's only on offer in times of peace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second In Time And In Quality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an advocate of Sam Peckinpah's "Straw Dogs", I was prepared to condemn this remake and utterly disregard it as for Rob Zombie's "Halloween" duo. Strangely enough, I can't. The film is extravagantly inferior to Peckinpah's incomparable piece of manhood and mankind, but it is not a total failure like many viewers want it to be. For the un-necessity to have it made in the first place, I can possibly subscribe to that notion. Other condemnations, no. The film has tried to adapt the 1970's story to today's world of class differences. Relocating the entire backdrop from rural England to America South, a few of new subplots are added. Such a dramatic change causes the storyline to be less than solid, compared to the original version. The character of Charlie, for instance, is supposed to be of flesh and blood and more real. The new version reduces him to a cardboard character. The rape, the sadism, the religious fanaticism, and the folk leadership are meant to be subtle, as in the old version, and not in the face. David's character is realistic as weakly male of today, but Dustin Hoffman's David is much more believable as a man of softness, weakness, and moral superiority. James Marsden's David falls short. We must blame him for not adapting and standing his ground, as opposed to understanding his higher-moral obligations. On the contrary, I find Kate Bosworth's Amy to be much relevant to the story development, as compared to the slutty Susan George's character of the original. James Woods as the Coach is a pathetic old drunk, incomparable to Len Jones's deeply scary Mr. Hedden. Now, the violence. It occurs to me that simple killings of the 1971 version are real horror because the violence truly comes from inside. We all fear that fellow human beings to become that much violent to us. However, the violence of the 2011 version is commonplace, non-shocking, and failing to address the animal instinct of mankind. This is for me the remake's greatest weakness. Violence for Sam Peckinpah is a major character whom you never forget. Violence here in the 2011 version is a blowing wind that leaves no trace and footprint when it is done. Nice try, Mr. Lurie, but you still come much second to the dead dear director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are remakes and there are remakes. Granted, right now in Hollywood, you can't step on a celebrity star without tripping over a remake, but, sometimes they can work. Sometimes. If a film was made a while back that had a decent idea, but, for whatever reason, couldn't be truly realised, then why not give it a modern day makeover? Then you have the other kind of remakes.Straw Dogs is a remake of an ultra violent seventies movie about a man and woman who move into a new home in Cornwall, only to run into trouble with the locals. In the remake, the action has been moved to America, but the plot is basically the same.If you know what to expect then you're waiting for the violence to finally kick off. It does, eventually, but not before well over an hour of 'build up.' This build up shows us how the young, nice, happy couple completely ignore all warning signs that they have a town full of redneck psychos all around them until it's too late and the afford-mentioned psychos are throwing bricks through their window and trying to lynch them.The originally Straw Dogs was only famous (or rather infamous) for its violence. Since then, we've seen far worse gore and brutality on screen and remaking it (quite faithfully to be fair) seems a little pointless. There isn't enough gore to keep the 'gore-fiends' happy. It's too slow to be classed as a psychological thriller. And the characters are too stupid to know what's coming until it's too late.I think, if this was the first incarnation of Straw Dogs, it might be called a 'home invasion' film. However, the fact that there are other films out there which have already secured that particular niche genre, makes this one even less original. Funny Games, The Strangers, that British one that I watched and completely forgot its name - all of those have beaten the Straw Dogs remake to the punch, However, if you're a fan of Kate Bosworth and like the idea of watching her running around in not very many clothes for the whole film, then you might get something out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the 30th anniversary of Dustin Hoffman's classic film, Straw Dogs, the studio decided instead of re-releasing a special edition, that they would do a modern re-make of the film. For those unfamiliar with the story, it features a local girl, from a small Mississippi town, who has returned home with her new husband, after making it big in Hollywood. Once back in town, the new couple needs some work on the old farm that she inherited and hire an old friend of hers to do the job. The team is the most qualified in town, but right from the start you can see the tension starting to build. Straw Dogs is far from being a unique story, but what I really enjoyed about it was how methodical it was. The jealousy and tension are obvious from the start, but they build it slowly, through a serious of events, which lends credibility to both sides of the argument. Things continue to build right up until the end of the film when all hell breaks loose, thanks to an incident that really shouldn't involve either the workers or the couple. James Marsden and Kate Bosworth star and are both very good, but the star that shines the brightest is Alexander Skarsgard. I've never seen him in anything before and had no expectations about the kind of job he'd do and I was blown away. He really had to play two different roles in this film and it leads to some shocking and unexpected moments. Comparing the 2011 re-make to the original film, the stories are very similar, whoever I found in parts where the original was a little slow, the re-make turns up the intensity, and that's the way things should be. A lot of re-makes don't even compare to the original and are seldom better, but in this case it was. The producers looked back at the old film and enhanced the parts of the original that were too slow or didn't make a whole lot of sense, before modernizing the whole thing. There are some people who will never admit to liking a re-make, but I think with Straw Dogs, the producers took a good film and turned it into a great one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having not seen the original nor ever hearing of this remake I came across this film by fluke and after reading the premise I decided to give it a watch. After checking out the score here on IMDb I wasn't expecting much so I was gladly surprised when I found this movie very well done. It put me on the edge of my seat, there was a foreboding from the moment the couple arrived in town...Yes it started out a little slow but in a good way, the characters and their motives and backgrounds were well fleshed out and by the time the plot began to climax I genuinely was interested in the town, its inhabitants and mostly though I wanted to see the antagonists get some justice served to them. It did take awhile to gain momentum, the lead actor was not very likable and I found it tough to empathize with him at times (may have been the intent in hindsight) and it was a tad cliché' and predictable, there certainly is nothing new here. Regardless this movie was enjoyable and thrilling from the outset and I take it the low score here on IMDb is due to fans of the original unfairly scoring this remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Milder remake of an unpleasant classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the first time ever, I was completely unbiased to watch a remake! Usually Hollywood always has the god-awful and annoying habit of remaking personal favorite horror/cult movies of mine that are already impeccable and not really suitable for improvement, but regarding "Straw Dogs" I felt a lot less concerned since I never was a die-hard admirer of Sam Peckinpah's original from 1971. Surely I acknowledge its importance and influence for the genre, but still mainly consider it to be a deeply unpleasant movie that all too enthusiastically glorifies senseless violence and somehow spreads the message that every man needs to undergo a couple of rape and violence rituals in order to become a real man. "Straw Dogs" 2011 also isn't just any random remake from an aspiring young director who desperately needed an obvious jumping board to success, but by the intelligent writer/director Rod Lurie. He inserted a couple of relevant changes (like the geographical transfer from redneck Southern England to redneck Southern United States) and efficiently put the emphasis on in-depth character development. There's still a fair portion of harsh violence and misogynic brutality in this version, mind you, but at least it's depicted in a lot less gratuitous and joyous way. The infamous rape sequence, for example, still evokes debates regarding provocation but at least the script doesn't all too obviously endorse the so-called 'rape-myth' that all women secretly desire to be physically dominated. The rest of the plot remains the same as well (also because it's a book adaption, of course) and thus focuses on a successful couple temporarily moving to the girl's hometown in Southern Mississippi. The (re-)integration in this traditional and underdeveloped community leads to embarrassing situations for the husband and humiliating confrontations for the wife, as her former boyfriend Charlie and his gang of tough huntsmen penetrate themselves into their lives. Things come to a bloody climax when David and Amy want to prevent the locals from executing private justice. "Straw Dogs" effectively bathes in grim and unsettling atmosphere and hugely benefices from the performances. James Marsden and Kate Bosworth are excellent, but particularly the local hillbillies are portrayed in a disturbingly realistic matter. Amongst them also the always reliable James Woods as a hellish football coach. Also, respecting the rules of cinema, there's some fuzz about a bear claw rather early in the film, so you just know this particularly gruesome and inventive murder instrument will be back in the finale as well.PS: lovely soundtrack with, amongst others, the wondrous ballad "Summer Wine" by Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood. I hadn't heard that song in years, but I now instantly added it to my play lists again.</fullReview>

Almost everyone is miscast: Marsden isn't wimpy enough, Bosworth isn't sexy enough, Skarsgard isn't menacing enough, and Woods is totally unbelievable.Why doesn't she tell her husband she was raped? Why does her ex-boyfriend rapist let his buddy rape her too? Why does the coach go insane just because he can't find his daughter, to the point he kills the sheriff? Why is he in the middle of nowhere (no phone service) trying to write a non-fiction book? Surely that may require research. Why does the husband fight back on behalf of a barely known acquaintance?Avoid this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>if you are seeking a Triller film where most of the Characters are suffering from psychological issues, then this movie is for you!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this movie, the only character that demonstrate some logic in their thinking pattern is David summers (played by James Marsden), most of the characters (including Amy - played by Kate Bosworth) are showing signs of psychological problems, or suffering from some exaggerated emotional challenges. There are many parts/ scenes that can make one think or question as to why and what are the motives for such behaviors, as follows: A) An attractive female running alone in the woods without wearing any under-garment B) Living in an isolated house and chose not to lock the doors and think its safe and secure - silly. C) Purposely and deliberately undressing her garment in front of some men who shows signs of barbarism, and cruelty? - is like what the? hello, the girl is outnumbered if these men were to advance towards her D) an attractive young girl presumably 15yrs seducing a mentally retarded man (who is played by Dominic Purcell), - again, when you applied logic, it make no sense as there are plenty of Footballs players with equal physique (if she is really into handsomeness). E)the "one bullet can blow up a car" scene - it may work in a 60s and 70s Triller movie, (in which I later discovered it was actually a remake), but to bring this concept into the year 2011, its almost unacceptable. - and much more...So...if you enjoy watching Triller films where most of the characters are demonstrating some psychological problems, then this movie can help you achieve the "anxiety" state. Overall, strong casting but the concept and logic is a bit outdated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, it ain't the origin, that's for sure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>5 stars and that's being generous.The original film with Dustin Hoffman was riveting. In this re-make, the script comes across as being written by someone who has never lived in the country and therefore finds the idea frightening. I grew up in the country, lived most of my adult life in the city, and then moved back to the country - and in all my years of country living I've never seen people behave like Charlie &amp; his crew. If they did, we would have immediately fired them from the job.Kate Bosworth is so skinny she needs to stand up twice just to make a shadow, yet this is the woman Charlie &amp; his posse are lusting after.Kate's character, Amy, is a spoiled, attention seeking individual and her husband, David, is a sort of weak, nerdy, self-involved writer--which adds up to some problems in their marriage.This Straw Dogs version takes place in Mississippi with nary a southern accent anywhere in sight. The film is actually rather insulting to southerners - as most films are.One of the characters is supposed to be a mentally disabled individual, the actor who played him did such a poor job I thought at first he was trying to pretend to be blind--since he wouldn't look at a person when they were speaking to him, but just stared straight ahead.Alexander S.,who played Charlie did the best acting job in the film, plus we get the benefit of seeing him a lot without his shirt. Unfortunately, he is playing a villain, so the character is not likable, of course.WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW James Woods has reached the point in his career where he apparently can only get character roles in 2nd rate films. They decided in this version to have his character, Coach, be the main incentive behind the film's climax as to why Charlie and the boys attack David and his wife at their house.As is frequently the case, during some of the more exciting action scenes, the lighting is kept so low you have to guess at what is happening.Just how James Wood's Coach character could still function as he did following having boiling water thrown in his face is one of those "Hollywood neverminds" - meaning they hope you won't notice that piece of illogic.I've seen worse films, but if you want to see a good film of Straw Dogs, I'd recommend the Dustin Hoffman version from 1971.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Those silly rednecks...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another entry in Hollywood's favorite genre- ridiculing small town Americans.Our main character is named...wait for it...David- surprise surprise. He's a harvard-educated Hollywood screenwriter and is married to Amy a southern beauty queen. She inherits her family home/farm so they decide to drive there in their classic Jaguar convertible. As soon as they arrive, they go the the local pub where all the local creeps gather all at once and all the time. There is the violent retired coach, the mentally-disabled guy with his dog, the vulgar construction workers, and the black Sheriff?! One the construction workers, Charlie, turns out to be Amy's ex and he's conveniently the only unmarried guy in town. He isn't over her. No one respects the geeky David, who to make himself likable hires Charlie's construction crew on the spot to rebuild the barn.The town is so backward that they don't have any other beer than Budweiser and they won't take credit cards if you want to buy a beer. They even make a big deal of such stuff as religion, high school football, hunting, drinking. The construction crew immediately taunts Dave and gives him a hard time, they completely lack respect.Dave is articulate and bright and working on a project about WWII. But he is quite the jerk to Amy. Charlie and his friends drool over Amy every chance they get and Dave blames Amy for it. Amy seeing that Dave doesn't protect her, responds in ways that no reasonable woman would- by teasing Charlie. He takes the bait and rapes her, then his buddy takes his turn. But she won't tell her husband about it.Things take a bizarre turn when the couple hides the disabled guy who harmed the coach's daughter. As a result the construction crew and the coach take matters into their own hands and begin a home invasion. That forces Dave to finally become a man.Straw Dogs succeeds and its aims. It makes the rednecks look as bad as possible. The rape scene is quite tough and you end up hating the villains with a passion and cheering for the moment of revenge. Most of the cast does a good job, Woods overdoes it a bit, but the problem is Bosworth's character and her performance. The performance is quite lackluster. And her character's behavior is mindboggling. She does look mighty fine though and the cameraman and editor thankfully aren't shy about showing her off. The movie as a whole looks good, too, nice coloring and bright. Music is loud, obnoxious, and the lyrics coincide with the story- I'm so tired of that lame gimmick. All in all, an above-average movie for this genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watch this if...you don't mind a movie that is a bit far fetched and over the top, but still entertaining. If you are big on realism, I would pass on this film.Acting/Casting: 6* - The acting and casting is good and to me James Wood's performance as the washed up crazy retired coach really stands out. Outside of Woods, I didn't think there was any exceptional performances, but none poor either.Directing/Cinematography/Technical: 6* - The story comes together very nicely, but takes a while to get there. There are slow moments and also some scenes where you laugh at how over the top things play out. To me, eliminating a few scenes and taking away some of the unrealistic portions would have made this a much better film.Plot/Characters: 5* - A solid plot that is blown out of proportion. After moving to Hollywood and becoming an actress, a woman comes back home with her Husband to her little hometown. The Husband is treated as an outsider and the woman struggles with unresolved past issues. Blackwater itself is filled with issues and extreme characters that all come to a boiling point.Entertainment Value: 6* - As mentioned, it is a little slow and over the top, but it does manage to be entertaining. I plan to check out the original to see if it provides a better film. Much like the title implies, like a Straw Dog, once hyped it will likely be forgotten and ignored soon.My Score: 6+6+5+6 = 23/4 = 5.75Email your thoughts to filmwatchinfool@gmail.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Straw Dogs (2011): Dir: Rod Lurie / Cast: James Marsden, Kate Bosworth, Alexander Skarsgard, James Woods, Dominic Purcell: The title addresses the descend into evil and its eventual defeat. Remake of the 1971 Sam Peckinpah film, this one stars James Marsden and Kate Bosworth as a couple returning to her home town to fix up her home front. He is a screenwriter and she had a role in one of the series produced from his work. Eventually they encounter her ex- boyfriend whom dated her when she was a cheerleader. He and his friends are set to repair the roof of his barn, which leads to all sorts of stupid problems that could have been avoided had anyone used common sense. Marsden unwisely goes on a hunting trip where he is left stranded while the boys rape his wife. He will eventually grow a pair once his home is threatened and bullets are fired into his home in the violent climax where he must off everyone of them. This is where a bear trap comes in handy. Bosworth as the wife is a total idiot. She becomes enraged when her cat is found hanging in the closet, then she pulls the stupid move of taunting strip tease in front of her future rapists. Alexander Skarsgard plays the ex- boyfriend with all the personality of a shotgun revolver. James Woods plays the racist ill tempered coach whose underage daughter is involved with a mentally challenged male who accidentally kills her. Dominic Purcell plays the unfortunate handicapped guy who just can't seem to win. Complete with really bad CGI deer during two hunting scenes that might have well been made of straw as well.

David is working on a screenplay about Stalingrad.They hire Charlie (Alexander Skarsg?rd), Amy's high school sweetheart, to repair the barn roof. Charlie invites David out on a deer hunt. But when they lose David in the woods, they doubleback to the house to rape Amy.James Marsden is terribly miscasted as the nerdy David. In the '71 original, it was much more effectively played by Dustin Hoffman. David should be more like an AV nerd than the quarterback. Kate Bosworth is too pushy and lack chemistry with James Marsden. James Woods who plays coach Tom Heddon is just too cartoony. It's a badly conceived remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid enough thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went in with low expectations, considering all the negative reviews, but was relatively pleasantly surprised by the movie as a whole. Short summary: Man and wife (Played by Marsden and Bosworth) return to her hometown. It's very different from their former home so it's a little foreign to them. They are greeted by the wife's former boyfriend (Skarsg?rd)who, while pleasant enough a first, turns out to be a bit of a creep. The drama between these three characters, and the complications around them, is the center of the movie.The characters are simple, the husband's quite successful screenwriter who doesn't really fit in the smaller society, and the wife has a hard time recognizing her old home. The boyfriend is the local hero who is respected by all and feared by some.The acting is uneven, Bosworth is rather flat in her performance and in spite of the things that happen to her character it's hard to worry about her. Marsden and Skarsg?rd are much better. Marsden shows both big city attitude and uncertainty towards the foreign territory and his development over the movie feels quite genuine. Skarsg?rd goes from being charming to ominous to flat out terrifying with no problem and having met people like that he certainly made an impression on me.Overall the movie is forgettable but decent. Not planning to watch again but it wasn't a complete waste of time either.</fullReview>

James Marsden is just not right for this role. Kate is beautiful, but I can't understand her. I don't understand their relationship, either. There should be some problems in their marriage. But the movie fails to convey that. Alexander is very bad-ass, as his character should be. The only shining star in this movie is Dominic Purell. I love him in 'Prison Break'. He is still very manly as he physically can be. This movie just proves that he can play a very wide range of roles and make them convincing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passable, but many mistakes were made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen the original film, I didn't even know this was a remake until after I had finished seeing it. I was looking for something entertaining and chose those at the last minute. The film and the concept has a lot of great potential but many mistakes hinder the film being good or even outstanding like it could have been. I think the movie was rushed, slapped together in some spots and maybe even some bad editing. Let me talk about the mistakes I think were made. The pace of the first hour of the film is brutally slow. We don't need to see a dozen different examples of the guys creeping on the wife. One or even two is sufficient. No one ever needs to see a rape. Why some of these films feel the need for shock value so badly that they have to try to top each other with rape scenes is beyond me. It isn't entertainment to watch a person being sexually victimized. The ending is so unsatisfying. You would think with the concept of the husband exacting revenge that it would tie up the loose ends but it doesn't at all. His wife never tells him she was raped although maybe we are supposed to assume she did. And finally the characters are extremely one dimensional with maybe the exception of the husband.The husband is played by James Marsden. He does carry the film decently considering its a sub par script. His character goes through a lot of changes in the film so in that aspect he does well. When he finally exacts his revenge the film is interesting but unfortunately that's well over the one hour mark. His wife is played by Kate Bosworth and I found her very unlikable in this. Her character is very empty and one dimensional and while she goes through a lot too, you won't really care one way or another. Her and Marsden have passable chemistry together. James Woods actually helps the cast playing loud mouthed Coach Tom. He actually stands out in his performance although the script doesn't help him any either. Alexander Skarsg?rd is the tough looking lead psycho. His character starts out almost likable and then evolves but ultimately he doesn't get a lot to work with other than being a psycho. Dominic Purcell plays a mentally handicapped man who gets himself into trouble. I love Purcell, I've loved him since John Doe and Prison Break but his character in this film is almost pointless. Its like a sub story but it just isn't necessary. However, Purcell is good in the role.Director and writer Rod Lurie has had some good solid movies under his belt. I just feel like perhaps this was rushed in some way or they spent too much on the build up and then tried too hard to be shocking. The film is passable as I said but it has a lot of great potential and never follows through with any of it. If its your only choice, or on TV (though it'd likely be heavily edited) then you might as well check it out, otherwise there are far better thrillers out there. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great performances but low on anything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to grow up with revenge flicks from the seventies like Dirty Harry and Death Wish. They were brutal at the time, I even went further to see rape/revenge flicks and liked Sam Peckinpah due his brutal view towards his characters. But that all worked back then, it was just before the heydays of gory slashers so people really were still shocked then. Today standards are much higher and we all know that it is a bit tricky to remake classics. And here it shows again. I did like the acting abilities and I must say that Alexander Skarsg?rd (Charlie) did a great job. In fact they were all believable especially the couple Amy and David Sumner (Kate Bosworth and James Marsden) and it was funny to see James Woods again, he still can get angry. Where this revenge flick failed a bit was the fact that it took over an hour before things really got out of hand. When Amy meets her fate with Charlie I guessed, well, now it really is going to happen but it didn't. You really have to wait until the last 15 minutes before revenge is happening. When it happens it's all okay but it was a bit too late. There is an sudden amount of blood but for example the rape scene isn't explicit or even frightening. I guess when this should been shown back in the seventies it should have worked but not this time. On the other hand it did work well on part of the score. That was a nice surprise. And I admit, due the low on anything rape scene the intervention with the hunting scene's did work also. Still, I thought it would have had more rough scene's due the length of this flick. Guess it won't be noticed like it's original one.Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie where the main character is unlikeable and is hard to root for when the problems start. Very OK, end is good. I say B-</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"That boys got some man in him after all." Screen writer David (Marsden) and his wife Amy (Bosworth) move from LA to Amy's hometown in the south. They run into one of Amy's ex's named Charlie (Skarsgard) and the tension between them starts. While David and Amy are trying to work through their problems Charlie and his friends begin to mess with David. The only way to review this to me is to think of it as two movies. The first hour and a half is pretty slow and a lot of build up to the climax. The last half hour is tense and makes you glad you kept watching. The big problem to me in this is that the person you are supposed to root for and feel bad for is David, and after ten minutes you realize he is not a likable guy and don't really feel bad at all that he is being messed with. The only person that I felt any sympathy for is a secondary character who is barely in the movie. Having only seen part of the original it's hard to compare the two, but based on the last few re-makes I would have to think the original is better. This one did have it's moments though and the last half hour makes it a decent watch. Overall, a very OK movie with an ending that saves it. The kind movie where you aren't sure who to root for though. I give it a B-.</fullReview>

Who on earth would do that? How come six armed men get bested by a couple trapped inside a house? What the film does best is creating tension that keeps building and gets more intense as the story proceeds. There is tension in every line dialog and the actors do an excellent job of delivering them convincingly. Shouts to James Woods for portraying a character that is an absolute ass. There a holes in the plot, and it is not meant to be realistic, but to deliver a great Hollywood experience and I highly recommend it to anyone who looks for an intense movie to be thrilled and have a good time.

		<shortDescription>As dogs go, this one was neutered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this dreadful, dreary, condescending, and pointless remake of the 1971 classic, a mild-mannered man and his hot wife move to the Deep South and run into a mess of trouble, mostly having to do with rednecks, hillbillies, and small-town hatred. Straw Dogs has no bite.You might remember the '71 film. Sam Peckinpah set it in rural England. The main character was a mathematician/pacifist, played by Dustin Hoffman. Soon, he and the missus are terrorized by local hoods. This one, directed by Rod Lurie (The Contender, The Last Castle), stars James Marsden as an LA screenwriter who moves with his wife Amy (Kate Bosworth) to her daddy's old homestead. No mention is made of writer David's pacifism, but we're led to assume he's not the fighting kind, in obvious and stark contrast to the good ol' boys who live in the town. Soon, yep, the local boys are terrorizing both Amy and David.Added to the fish-out-of-water theme is the backdrop of the religion of high-school football. Lot of pressure on the kids, even more on the coach. James Woods appears as a drunken lout of an ex-coach, a foul- mouthed buffoon who's essentially a caricature of redneck ignorance and entitlement. I don't expect much nuance out of Woods anyway, but he's so over the top here that I wonder if he just did the best he could with the material he had. Anyway, Woods' character Coach Heddon has a nubile cheerleader daughter (of course) who, in a subplot that is more meaningful than it ought to be, is ambiguously attracted to the town's one mentally handicapped man (there may be others, but this one is at least diagnosed; Coach naturally doesn't care for this and flies off the handle pretty frequently if he sniffs something's amiss. Amy and David hire Amy's ex, Charlie (Alex Skargaard) and his friends to patch the roof of their barn. Big mistake, but understandable, since David wants to make nice with the town (he drives a Jag, wears nice clothes, looks the part of the Better Than You crowd). But soon enough, the couple are menaced by Charlie and company, sometimes with subtlety, sometimes not.Peckinpah's original film was about the breaking point of a peaceful man. Lurie's didn't seem to be making that point. That is, the violence in the '71 film existed to substantiate a theme; here, it's there just to shock and anger. But it fails to do the former - everything is easily predictable - and since we never really get into the heads of the two leads, it cannot hope to achieve the latter, either.The acting is pretty atrocious. Neither Marsden nor Bosworth comes off particularly well, but my expectations for either are pretty low, and they met them. It's another contrast with the '71 movie. Dustin Hoffman was entering his peak and offered a terrific, terrifying performance. Susan George wasn't bad, either. But Marsden and Bosworth seemed to have been cast simply because they look good as a couple.I believed they were married, but nothing they said or did invested me in their problems to any real degree.Whereas Hoffman's character was a brainy math wizard, Marsden's is... a screenwriter. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying screen writing is easy, although this film does make a good case for that argument. But let's face it; the movie would have worked better if David had been a novelist, or a professor, or a researcher. In any event, despite his work-area props (including blackboard), David never seems to be particularly bright. Such as the time when he lets Charlie talk him into going hunting with the boys, despite the fact that he's never fired a weapon. Oy.The scary scenes aren't scary, the climax is expected but still jarring, there is no nuance to be found in any character, and the movie feels a lot longer than it really is, because there are many scenes that exist merely to pad the running time, rather than to advance something as mundane as a plot. The theme of a peaceful man finally breaking is merely hinted at here; Hoffman's slow change in the original is replaced by a blink-and-you-miss-it transformation by Marsden that, on the whole, is as senseless as the violence it provokes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Redneck redo with one redeeming factor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a synopsis that I will not bore you with as you can read it on the IMDb page. This is just another city boy versus good ole boys type of movie where the city slicker finds out that he can be a homicidal maniac too. Meanwhile, his wife Amy, an obviously mentally unstable individual, flirts between wanting to encourage her old flame and wanting to leave to go back to the safety of the city. Early on in the movie I thought perhaps she was even plotting to have him killed by the locals and go back to her hunky former flame.I say the lead female, Amy, is portrayed as a whack job because she taunts her old flame, strips at the window, jogs by the men working while wearing no bra and skimpy clothes, yet expects some kind of respect from these local boys hired to work on a roof. Now in no way am I saying that when she tells Charlie, her ex played by Alexander Skarsgard, that she does not want to have sex that she is being a willing participant. This is clearly a rape at this point. However, the way that her character has switched from heated longing while gazing upon him, and who wouldn't since looking at Skarsgard is the only redeeming factor of this movie, to total disinterest is totally unbelievable. Had she maybe been enticed, then changed her mind after thinking about her husband or something it may have been believable but as it was portrayed it just came out as plane stupid. Then this other guy appears and it seems to me that Skarsgard is not too pleased about this so why he would allow it I don't know and the movie doesn't tell us or set up any kind of revenge deal that would give me a clue.This movie is the worst of typical southern stereotyping, along with some abuse of the mentally disabled, fake looking dead deer, characters we don't care enough about to hate or like and if it were not for getting to see sexy Skarsgard sans shirt, well, it would have no reason to exist. Please find him better movies so I don't have to sit through this again. I know it was a remake but one that shouldn't have been remade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather flat remake of a controversial classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given Hollywood's recent trend for remaking anything and everything, it was perhaps inevitable that Sam Peckinpah's controversial classic Straw Dogs would eventually get a new makeover. Rod Lurie's version moves the action from Cornwall to the Deep South of America, where bible-bashing rednecks become the new village thugs, and fish-out-of-water Hollywood writer James Marsden replaces Dustin Hoffman's meek mathematician. The remake is generally rather disappointing, with none of the gnawing tension or subtle character development that made Peckinpah's Straw Dogs so memorable. What good moments are to be found here are lifted almost shot-for-shot from the 1971 version? such as the farm siege climax, which is so unaltered that every death happens exactly as it did in the old one, while whole passages of dialogue are re-used word for word.Script writer David Sumner (James Marsden) moves to the home town of his new wife Amy (Kate Bosworth). He's working on a screenplay for a new war movie and believes that quiet seclusion is exactly what he needs to get the job done. Amy is something of a darling to the townsfolk. She's the success story; the one that flew the nest. Her fairly insignificant career in Hollywood is big news back home, and she is treated like royalty wherever she goes. A bunch of oafish builders come out to the Sumner's swamp-side house to work on a new barn roof. Among them is Charlie Venner (Alexander Skarsg?rd), Amy's old flame. Over time, tensions flare between the Sumners and the builders, with David in particular finding himself troubled by their backwards attitudes and the way they lecherously ogle his wife. Things come to a head at the end, when mentally handicapped runaway Jeremy Niles (Dominic Purcell) ends up at the Sumner place after accidentally smothering a teenaged girl. The rednecks want to have Niles handed over, but David refuses to let them take the law into their own hands and keeps him inside, resulting in a siege of escalating violence and bloodshed.There's nothing much to add about this Hollywood reboot. By and large, it seems rather tame next to the old version. The rape sequence isn't exactly pleasant, but it is nowhere near as distressing as the one shown in the older movie; the climactic siege is a bloodily staged action sequence but it too lacks the raw shock and terror of its predecessor. Moving the location doesn't really add anything to the story, except that the backwoods of America appear too sunny and colourful to generate the same unsettling atmosphere as a foggy Cornish moor. The performances are solid but uninspiring; the script is flat as a pancake; the action sequences are put together with competent professionalism rather than powerful raw energy. Overall, Straw Dogs is a disappointingly safe retread which does nothing to erase memories of the still-potent 1971 original</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Straw Dogs" is a faithful adaptation of the original 1971 version. But only if your definition of "faithful" means scene-by-scene, word-for-word duplication, not if your definition means including the same thoughtful ideas that can stay with you after the movie ends. It's also a thriller. But, again, only if "thriller" means nothing happens until we get a lot of gruesome violence at the end. Which apparently it does for most people.From what I know, the only real change made was the profession of the main character David Sumner (James Marsden). In the original, he was a mathematics professor. The point being that he was an intellectual and could not relate (even if he wanted) to the common, country folk. In this version, he's a Hollywood screenwriter of the laughably bad TV crime shows. Apparently that's the modern version of an intellectual.In good thrillers, the slow scenes at the beginning are meant to be character-building scenes. Establishing the complexities to the characters and mounting anticipation for what might happen to them. In "Straw Dogs", these characters appear to be made out of straw. There is absolutely no substance to them, and in some cases were randomly thrown together using characteristics from past movie characters. The worst one was the wife of Sumner. I'm guessing that she was the one we were supposed to feel sorry for. But once we get past the first hour of nothingness, she was just there for shock value. Not for us to consider the many horrible consequences to rape, or the varying dynamics to family and childhood relationships. And the reason why there is nothing for us to think about is because she is not a real character since nothing about her was clearly established.The first hour of this movie literally had nothing to it. The set-up of Sumner and his wife moving back to her hometown and the boorishness of the locals could have been established in two to five minutes instead of 60. If they wanted to give us characters they could have done it then. But as I have already beaten that to death, they did not give us any characters.By the time we get to the end of "Straw Dogs", we're not only supposed to be deeply invested in the livelihood of the characters but we're also supposed to be questioning where the line of morality actually lies or is everything just grey? Instead we just want to the screen to turn grey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hollywood Recycle Machine Continues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there was ever a court case accusing Hollywood of having run out of ideas and duping box office patrons with recycled product, Straw Dogs (2011) might be considered exhibit A.Back in 1971, Sam Peckinpah adapted Gordon Williams' novel, The Siege of the Trencher's Father into a screenplay that attached Dustin Hoffman to the controversially violent film titled Straw Dogs. On an estimated budget of just over $3 million, Straw Dogs told the story about an American mathematician named David Summer (Hoffman) who is provoked by a small town's bullies in Cornwall England. They terrorize the seemingly wimpy David and rape his wife until David decides to fight back in equally violent fashion.The 1971 film went on to gross over $11 million worldwide, but was hardly considered neither a commercial hit nor was it one of Peckinpah's best (Hoffman all but disowned the film and would famously admit to only accepting the role for the money).But here we were some 40 years later and the Hollywood machine was busy churning out 16 remakes and reboots in 2011 ? Straw Dogs being one of them.In the 2011 edition, James Marsden and Kate Bosworth signed on the dotted line to star as David and Amy Summer. Director Rod Lurie (The Last Castle) made some major changes to the screenplay and set the updated version in the deep south of America. David was also changed from a mathematician to a screenwriter. But all other major elements of the story ? in particular the evil townsfolk remained the same.Alexander Skarsg?rd plays Charlie, a former love interest for Amy that attempts to rekindle the flame when David and Amy return to the family home in an attempt to find some peace and quiet while David writes his book. And James Woods plays a complex old man that has a penchant for drink and the violence that the bottle brings.The tension between David and Charlie starts as a simple indifference between a city boy and a small town country worker. But it escalates with Charlie's continued pining for Amy ? a desire that will have Charlie break into the home and rape his former girlfriend.But it is when Amy and David attempt to harbor the town idiot, Jeremy (played by Prison Break's Dominic Purcell) that things really begin to escalate. Tom Heddon (Woods) believes that Jeremy did wrong towards his young grandchild and he comes with a town posse to the Summer house to violently extract Jeremy at any cost.Much like the original version, David is able to use his home and its contents as protection from the increasing threat and in expected fashion, a final showdown between David and Charlie will highlight the climax of the film.Straw Dogs was remade for all the wrong reasons (well, make that no reason that we can think of), and the results provide nothing more than a numb action film with predictable results. The rape and the violence that was so cutting edge back in 1971 (the original film was banned in many countries) seems relatively routine in 2011 and serviceable performances by the film's leads does little to help elevate the film above mediocrity.There has been hundreds of films with the protagonist rising to the increased levels of violence to discourage a threat since Straw Dogs in 1971 and Rod Lurie decided that a simple setting change was all that was required to draw in a new audience.Lurie would have been better served had he pushed the envelope and developed a remake that was more in line with 2010's I Spit on Your Grave. Instead, the screenplay plays safe and despite a wonderful performance by James Woods (who is always at his best when he is evil), the film offers nothing that will have you recollect its details a few weeks after screening.www.killerreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake is always hard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I mean I know this is a hard one to go see, but if you are going for the entertainment part, it will be a bit tricky because there are some violence and plot wise in the movie might be offensive to some people. However, that been said, it is also I think this movie is very tricky to make at the first place, with all the original version pressure, casting and Director comparisons and the most importantly the most notorious and controversial scene in the movie. I like the movie a lot, but I am not going to compare this one with the original, because I felt they both got a different feeling to it, Rod really did a fantastic job about letting people understanding the feeling of being alienated... it's like an adult version of being bullying by your neighbors without even knowing you. The humanity side of the movie is that at the end of this movie how the protagonist totally snapped and freak out, not out of the blue but under extenuating circumstance. Many people been distracting too much away from the notorious scene and forget the real motto and messages the director tried to convey from this movie. I think it's also very interesting how many people didn't even know why the title was named "Straw Dogs"....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I booed this movie -- from my living room!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I checked this film out at my local library and was intrigued by the film's liner notes. Boy was I ever misled. If I wanted to watch Halloween XX, I would have gotten it.This film has more plot holes than a Swiss cheese. As mentioned, I would expect one of those drive-in camp slasher flicks to make no sense whatsoever but this one took the cake. The central characters are a couple of newlyweds(?) from the West Coast - he's a screenwriter and she a starlet. They come to her hometown in Mississippi so he can spend some quiet time writing at her ancestral farm/ranch/cabin. From the moment they roll into town in their Jaguar any one with any sense would know to pop a U-turn and head in the opposite direction. The locals are more than stereotypical pickup truck with gun rack, rebel yelling, confederate flag waving neanderthals who of course, all know the wife from her days as head cheerleader. A pack of four of these gorillas waste no film time moving in on her, showing no respect for either her or her liberal, west coast dimwit of a husband. At this point, the wife too, seems to like the attention. It is also at this point we are introduced to the town's ex-football coach played by James Woods, a perpetual drunken hothead whom no one in town seems to have any ability or real desire to control. We also are clued in that Wood's character has it in in a big way for another of the town's characters, a mentally challenged guy (as if they all aren't) who through osmosis we must surmise must be some kind of sex offender since the ex-coach beats the holy tar out of the guy just for breathing every time he sees him, screaming "you'd better not look at my daughter!" Oh, did I mention the coach has a 15-year old Lolita-ish daughter? This poor slob (I'll call him DumDum) has a brother who always shows up just after the beatdown to plead for baby bro's release. Anywho, wifey once had a thing with the ringleader of the clique (their pictures together from high school still adorn the local bar(?). We don't know why they broke up (so she could go to Hollywood?) but we get the feeling she was a number one tease even back then and hasn't changed much since. The couple hire these slobs to do contracting work on the family farm (can you spell mistake?); the boys show up whenever they want to, help themselves to whatever is in the fridge, blast their music and don't do much else except give hubby the stinkeye and undress wifey with their eyes. In short, doing anything they can to annoy the husband and we guess, impress the wife who, incredibly even puts on a mini strip show for them from her bedroom window! All the while hubby seems completely unwilling to even act like he knows what is going on even though it is obvious he hates these hicks. So if it was his idea to come there in the first place, why doesn't he pack it in and leave? Moving forward, the wild bunch bullies hubby into going hunting with them (stupidly he accepts) where they take pot shots at him with their rifles even though he is the only one wearing an orange vest. They even abandon him in the woods so that they can sneak back to the ranch and gang bang his wife. Did she enjoy it? We can't really be sure because she never tells hubby about it. For his part, he never confronts THEM about dumping him in the woods either. Instead they decide to go the local team's football game where the gang sit right behind them, leering salaciously!!!MEANWHILE, coach's little tramp of a daughter corals DumDum in the locker room. She has GOT to know her daddy will kill this guy if he catches them. Sure enough, he comes looking for her but only after her fellow slutty cheerleaders drop a dime on where she is (incredible). As daddy runs around the enormous locker room (more like for a pro team than high school) looking for her, DumDum takes a cue from Of Mice and Men and accidentally suffocates her in an attempt to keep her quiet. It must be noted here that the death of this girl is never ever mentioned again -- we don't when or if they ever even found her at movie's end!!! Meanwhile DumDum has apparently escaped because like a deer in the headlights he is sent rolling over the hood of the Jaguar when hubby and wife decide to leave the game and drive home. Hubby calls for an ambulance which the local dispatcher chick promptly puts out over the whole town's CB so that coach and the goon gang can race to the ranch where they plan to act as a lynch mob for DumDum (they still are clueless as to whatever happened to baby girl). Oh yea, for another odd reason the local sheriff is barely out of high school himself, is an Iraq War Vet and is black. Needless to say, he doesn't get much respect either and one has to wonder how the heck he got the job. We can only assume nobody else wanted it. I sure wouldn't.As the mob proceed to destroy the ranch, hubby decides to grow a pair under the pretext of protecting the innocent-until-guilty rights of DumDum (we know he's guilty) while not seeming to care all that much what happens to wifey. The sheriff shows up -- they off him -- and the ensuing bloodbath eventually leaves only the good guys - husband and wife. What happened to DumDum? Is he still upstairs or what? I guess that's for the sequel. Boooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insult to the classic Peckinpah film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the past several years now, I have held the firm belief that there are no longer any original thinkers or writers left in Hollywood. This pointless and insulting remake of an American classic is a perfect example of my belief. Almost everything that made Peckinpah's film great has been stripped from this piece of blase' celluloid quite simply in an attempt to appeal to the "average" young moviegoer. There is nothing to think about after the film. It does not make you question your own beliefs or concepts of right and wrong. The only thing I thought was "Why did I actually watch this until the end?". Unfortunately, this trend is only going to get worse as the larger production companies are simply looking for a movie that will give them a big payday for the opening weekend and... well, thats really about it. There are some films that could use a re-make, but most of them should simply not be touched. There was no need to remake this classic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do Not Waste Your Time On This Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was an absolute disappointment. The whole time I was wondering what the movie was about and when was the plot going to unfold. I was so frustrated the whole time because things were left unanswered. The main character, Amy, appears to be scared of her ex and his friends, but you don't know why. She is bra-less the majority of the movie (might as well have been naked) and goes on a jog in short shorts with no bra and a tight tank top. Her ex and all his friends pretty much eyef*ck her and she complains to her husband about it. He says maybe you should put on a bra. She replies "Are you saying I'm asking for it?!" Angry, she goes upstairs, splashes water on her chest, and slowly takes off her shirt in front of the window so that her ex and his friends who are working on the barn's roof will see. I did not understand this part. They later rape her while her husband is hunting which they tricked him into doing. She pretty much knew she was going to get raped and didn't put up a fight which made me very upset. This movie was so depressing and disturbing. I'm not going to write the whole plot, but just know that it is not worth watching and in my opinion the worst movie I think I've ever seen.</fullReview>

I have lived in Louisiana for the past 3.5 years and would find this much more plausible in LA. I have actually encountered these type people in LA. Leave it to Hollywood to depict MS in a negative light when MS is a state they know nothing about. This type of rape and violence would be common in Atlanta, Detroit, DC, Los Angeles, or New Orleans. The backward, redneck, sick hillbilly characters would be common in Louisiana, not Mississippi. Wake up folks. MS has never been this sick and ignorant. Hollywood should offer a public apology to everyone in MS, not only for this film, but for everyone made with the same inaccurate and malicious bias.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An utterly pointless remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of the 1971 Straw Dogs features James Marsden (Cyclops from X-Men) as David Sumner, a man who moves with his wife Amy (Kate Bosworth, both of whom starred in Superman Returns as an engaged couple) back to her hometown of Blackwater Mississippito finish his screenplay. After bumping into local-boy and Amy's high school sweetheart Charlie (Alexander Skarsg?rd - Zoolander) they hire him and his buddies to do up the dilapidated barn on Amy's property. As the men labour, they covet Amy and frictions between the intellectual David and Charlie flare. Will they manage to resolve their issues peacefully?To avoid launching into an essay-length comparison between this version and the Dustin Hoffman one, I think it's worth noting that this is a loyal remake that keeps the same plot devices as the first. It's exactly the same story but with the volume turned down. In doing so, it's lost a lot of the symbolism and comes across as celebrating the violence rather than lamenting what David has been driven to. The cast are capable but I wasn't impressed with anyone's acting (not even James Woods as the coach) and Kate Bosworth's rendition of the plot-critical scene is truly confusing, I have no idea if she was meant to be half-enjoying it or not, but that's the way it's filmed (if you've seen the original, you'll know what I'm talking about) but it's pretty abhorrent regardless. Nonetheless it still fails to even compare, and has that greenish brown yet polished visual style to it that seems to be so common amongst many horror remakes from the 70s and 80s.In conclusion, this film doesn't really gain anything by being moved from Cornwall to Mississippi, in fact it loses out on many things (David is an outcast and the only American in Peckinpah's version, so as a result, the language barrier between an ambitious intelligent American and small minded drunken English folk in a small town is completely lost) the cast are decent enough but uninspiring but it's a noble attempt at contemporising the story for a new undemanding generation. Unfortunately, the imagery from the first ends up diluted and feels like they are just glamorising almost cartoonish violence. An uninspired remake that borrows too heavily from the original, including much of the dialogue and set pieces, and strips away any ambiguity (especially of the female lead and the marriage between David and Amy), as well as the infamous rape scene. Go for the gritty, morally ambiguous and far more tense/realistic 1971 version instead.</fullReview>

It was so full of erroneous Southern stereotypes it was ridiculous.Parts of it didn't even make sense and it was the worst, overacted performance by James Woods I have ever seen and I've always loved him as an actor. Were we suppose to dislike Amy? I thought the director did a disservice to women by the way Amy was portrayed and he should have been more familiar with the south before he attempted to use that as a location. The acting in general was weak. Don't waste your money or time watching. The one point I gave the movie was only for being able to look at Alexander Skarsgard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Deliverance was released in the early 70's there were still many parts of the South where you could find yourself in trouble if you were an outsider. It's an honest statement to say that much has changed in the last 40 years. Every stereotype that could be pulled out for this piece of trash film was pushed at such a pace that I was still trying to process the previous one before the next one came. In the end I had nothing but vile contempt for Amy Sumner and I didn't see any amount marriage counseling that would keep David from getting as far away from this psychotic disaster as possible. Then, I didn't find David to be the sharpest tool in the shed either. There are certain elements to many movies where the audience finds themselves questioning the common sense of the script. In Straw Dogs, you will be doing this throughout the whole film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Interpretation for Today's Audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie and it's '70s counterpart would be excellent sources for discussion in any humanities or contemporary history course. This is not a remake but a reinterpretation, an update if you will, to fit 21st century America. What changes: How women are treated and how they react to that treatment from the earlier version of submission to the contemporary version of independence. What doesn't change: Idolatry persists whether it's on the field or in the pews; hatred persists whether it's race, or mental/physical disabilities. The symbolism of hunting, whether it's deer or women, to prove manhood and superiority is iconic. An implied, and controversial, characterization of regional institutionalized intolerance as a function of mistrust of educational attainment and religious zealotry is present in both versions. What are straw dogs? They are the scapegoats, the easily discarded, the outsiders on which to place blame and thus, perhaps, release inner guilt. Guilt creates tension and the characters, both the locals and the newly arrived couple, hide but cannot escape those tensions. Kudos to the director, cast and crew for building that tension for the audience. The actors portraying the southern antagonists did an admirable job of setting up Marsden's character and Marsden did such an effective job of portraying a wussy wimp (e.g. clumsily bumping and tripping over the most trivial obstacles; sucking up to gain stature) that my normally humanistic compassionate self was looking for to his demise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original 1971 "Straw Dogs" is one of my favorite films of all time. Rod Lurie's update of "Straw Dogs" is a major improvement in several ways.The most obvious being Kate Bosworth's character, Amy. No longer is Amy a one dimensional "evil, back stabbing temptress." Amy can still be a petulant child, but she is no longer driven by spite. This is an important distinction and prevents her character from becoming "one of them," betraying David, earning the audiences anger and losing their understanding. Amy still "relaxes" about mid way thru the rape, not because she is excited but because she is disgusted with Charlie and with herself. Let me be clear: she doesn't blame herself for the rape! she's disgusted that she could ever have desired Charlie in the first place. Charlie realizes he has completely deluded himself and lost Amy in the worst way imaginable. Amy no longer sees Charlie as a human being never mind her old high school flame. It is with this realization that Charlie DOES stop being human and turn his back on Amy....high school..homecoming king..all his past accomplishments and also his future. Amy's cries for help fall on deaf ears. Kate Bosworth exhibits a depth here I didn't know she had. Her character of Amy, though flawed and STILL not as well developed as David and Charlie, is quite an accomplishment. You have no doubt where her emotions lie during some pretty raw, complex scenes. Alexander Skarsgard is equally if not more impressive. His performance of Charlie is nothing short of revelatory. Charlie is an "uber-villian," not only did he rape David's wife, he set up David to be killed! AND IT WAS PRE-PLANNED! This is a bad guy! Yet Skarsgard is able to bring layers to the character that make you feel sorry for Charlie (no pun intended!) His constant struggle to get out from underneath the shadow that has haunted him since high school. The shadow that James Woods' "Coach" represents. The shadow that Amy (and David) have evaded. The shadow that engulfs him, the shadow that makes him HATE them (Amy &amp; David). In the middle of these two is, of course, our hero (anti-hero?) David Sumner. The center piece, the force around which the others gravitate. Without a strong performance here the movie falls apart. James Marsden has always been capable in the X-Men movies, but whereas in the comics Cyclops is THE leader, in the movies, Marsden just kind of fades into the background, giving up the lead to Wolverine. His performance here makes me want to believe its more than just a one-off. From slapping the hundred dollar bill on the bar (he has no idea he's insulting them) to shooting the deer in the forest (tragic?) to the end scene ("I got them all" is that a smile on his face?) this is an Oscar worthy performance. A multi-layered performance to his character that just wasn't there in the original. Which brings us to Rod Lurie. First thing I realized when I started watching his 2011 version of "Straw Dogs," is Mr. Lurie knows the original AND is a huge fan. This is not a remake, nor an homage so much as a realization of the potential of the original material. Peckinpah's "Straw Dogs" has always been a flawed masterpiece by those who love it, myself included. Dustin Hoffman is at his peak, Susan George gives the performance of her career. David Warner (God himself) would never be better. The build up to the climax is unbearable. But there are problems. Amy's former "friends" are interchangeable. The two leads themselves are hard to emphasize with. Amy isn't just childish, she's vain, opportunistic and she stabs David in the back to save her own skin (we won't go into the "rape is enjoyable" misogynist fantasy here.) Davis IS a coward, he ran from the states not because he was avoiding the war but because he wants to avoid the CONFLICT over the war. Not exactly admirable. Throughout the movie David and Amy's "snipes" at each other are made out of spite and escalate accordingly. Unlikeable characters. And they are the two leads! I can't tell you the names of Charlie's friends in the original but I can tell you they're names after one viewing of the remake. This is where Rod Lurie shines. He has filled the movie out in ways few people would realize. For instance, no longer is David a mathematician, above Amy's head, now he's a writer, she's an actor. They are on equal ground. this is a significant change in establishing their relationship. In Lurie's version, David is no longer the failed father figure to Amy's ingénue. David even worked as the writer on Amy's TV show in the new version! Amy and David have a confidence both in themselves and as a couple not on display in the original. Something Charlie clearly lacks. He's still there. Lost in the past. And here again Mr. Lurie is able to fill this in by putting the story in the gulf coast. Not only have the local "boys" lost their youth and their football dreams, they have lost their self respect and their future....there is no work! Mr. Lurie drives this home by having David (!?!) talk of the economy and, of course, when he has Miss Bosworth say "They don't need sympathy, they need jobs." Some other nice touches on Mr. Lurie's part that add exceptional resonance to the characters: having James Woods Character, Coach drive most of the reprehensible action. He's still "coaching" the "boys!" How humiliating! A point driven home even further when he has Norman say "You're the quarterback" at the exact moment Charlie realizes he is nothing but a follower and always will be. Strong Stuff. This isn't a remake, a re-imagining or a reboot. It is, as Peckinpah would say, Just damn good film making."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Get your Daddy's gun, and shoot anyone that's not me".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a warm up for this picture, I watched the Peckinpah version just last week, having seen it during it's initial release back in 1971 and one other time a couple of years ago. I'm generally predisposed to original films and not their sequels, so my antenna was up for this picture figuring that I would likely be disappointed on one hand, while realizing that films made today make the most of a grittier and more intense style when it comes to themes of violence and revenge. I'm going to go out on a limb and take the minority view here (so far), as I found the picture to be a worthy remake and a compelling story in it's own right.I think if you've seen the original, the comparisons will be inevitable, and virtually impossible to ignore given a screenplay that utilizes much of the very same dialog. Moving the story from the English countryside to the deep South was an interesting decision, setting up an expectation of redneck hostility against the refined sensibilities of the Sumners (James Marsden and Kate Bosworth). Reprising the Dustin Hoffman role as David Sumner, I think Marsden did a fairly credible job, knowing that he'd be compared to an actor who's established himself as one of the modern day legends.Regarding Rod Lurie's reworking of the screenplay, I think there were a couple of points to consider that distinguish the story versus Peckinpah. The first has to do with the hunting trip. When Hoffman's character killed a fowl in the earlier picture, he conveyed a sense of disgust at the idea of killing a defenseless bird, further adding to the image of his character with no backbone. When Marsden brings down the deer, I had a somewhat different impression. It looked to me that this was a moment when his character realized that he was capable of killing, an inkling that the mayhem soon to follow would not be an entirely foreign concept.Another more compelling treatment of the rewrite had to do with Amy Sumner. Peckinpah created a distinct ambiguity in the rape scene with his original screenplay. Susan George was torn between revulsion and horror against her assailants, and a questionable identification with her one time boyfriend Charlie. One could almost say that she went along with Charlie in a convoluted payback for her husband's weakness as a man. I didn't get the same sense with the way Bosworth handled the scene. She was entirely repulsed and humiliated, violated in a way that left her totally defeated and helpless. It gave more credibility to the way she would seek her revenge when Charlie (Alexander Skarsgard) and Norman (Rhys Coiro) square off against each other during the home invasion.Let's face it though, the real reason to see this picture if you know anything about the 1971 version, is the finale when David Sumner decides to cut loose and defend his wife and property. For some reason I found it surprising that the rowdy hillbillies, led by Coach Heddon (James Woods), would be dispatched in the exact same manner in the very same chronology as executed by Hoffman's character. I have to say, the nail gun on Chris was an effective improvement over a length of wire. Scalding the coach and having him shoot himself in the foot seemed a lot more painful this time around when it was James Woods on the receiving end. This time though, the old bear trap maneuver was distinctively more graphic and satisfying, not to mention bloody. Poor Charlie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes remakes don't suck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As only ever seeing parts of the original, with this remake, I'm pretty sure I'd still enjoy this versions better. Remakes tend to be livelier than originals. Here there's a forty year stretch. Marsden in one of his best roles (an actor who by now really deserves recognition) and his girlfriend (Kate Bosworth) really sexing it up here, move out to the country, where Bosworth was once a resident. Screenwriter, Marsden, has come out here to get some peace and quiet to work on his writing. When a group of townsfolk laborers, led by a jealous ex boyfriend of Bosworth's, come out to build a barnhouse, so begins an unnerving game to test one's patience, the main operative being Marsden, where these tradesmen show some uncanny behaviour and unnerving traits. If familiar with the premise of the original, we're treading the exact same waters, where we really get good performances out of the cast, notably Alexander Skarsgard, as the grudging ex, intent on seeing outsider, Marsden break, where they're main objective is to eventually drive em' out. But what's great about this Straw Dogs, as again I haven't seen most of the original, was a subplot in the third act, which leads to an ending on a path you don't expect it to go, involving an accidental murder, with now a much avenging townsfolk, where an almost intensely suffocating finale ensues. As for violence, it's sparse, only used with necessary, here one visual standout, a squirming, bone breaking moment, I guess to pun it up. I found the movie, most entertainingly rewarding, all through, something to talk about, with an ending I didn't expect, as I did a version of the song Breathless, unsung by Jerry Lee Lewis, here, coming across Marsden's radio. Willa Holland is delicious eye candy, looking appetizing, full cheerleader uniform and all, the apple of an older retarded guy's eye (Dominic Purcell) and she doesn't exactly mind too, where they have an open relationship. An aging James Woods as Holland's father, who really storms with anger when provoked, I didn't recognize at first. I guess we all get old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You must see the Original first...Then you can skip this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The worst thing about this Remake is that it will lessen the impact of the Original if seen first. Mostly because it is virtually a scene for scene retelling of the highly impactive 1971 Film from Director Sam Peckinpah.What made the Original version so great was the unexpected. No one going into it anticipated such a restrained rage performance and a bloody, disturbing, violent Movie. After all, it had very little fanfare and Starred the tiny, effeminate Dustin Hoffman. This one should not be seen unless you have viewed the previous, powerful Film. It really has nothing new to offer and is lacking the style and charisma of Peckinpah's Crafting. The remake is competent at best but considering the source material it is a shallow retelling with a new location and stereotypical Characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Felt the remake is better than the original !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched both the new and old versions of "Straw Dogs" in a single day and still fresh from the experience, I found that I identified better with the newer version?for me at least, the remake was more believable than the original, in terms of acting, character development and location? Simply put the English thugs in the original did not strike me as terrifying or menacing?to me they were more buffoonish and funny?I did not find them or their behavior to be particularly intimidating?in fact I felt they behaved in a pretty normal manner when confronted by the American and his seemingly strange mannerisms? If anybody came across as abnormal or psychologically disturbed, it was the main character's wife, who sends out mixed signals by deliberately displaying her panties and subsequently her bare breasts to the gang of leering men, then whining to her nonplussed husband and still later on treating the same men to beer?and the rape was not really a rape, as she does not put much of a resistance even seemingly enjoying it towards the end?she came across as a far more seriously disturbed, immature and dangerous character, more disturbing then the supposed antagonists of this movie?when she is being raped again in the climax, notice how she screams for her ex-boyfriend (who is one of the attackers) instead of her husband for help?this proves that the first sex episode in the movie was not entirely without her consent? The acting too was too exaggerated and cartoonish to be effective?I felt I was watching a parody instead of a serious horror movie?and don't tell me that was how movies were in the early 70s?I have watched older movies with far more convincing acting?I cracked up when Hoffman tries to stop Norman from assaulting the mentally disturbed guy in his house and Norman says "don't lay your hands on meeeeee"?the drawing out of the "me" was unintentionally comic?there were plenty of other moments in the movie where the outlandish acting was funny though not intended to be so? And I absolutely hated the character of the wife, who was silly, clingy, immature and adulterous; hankering unreasonably for her husband's attention and then ready to desert him when he needs her support the most?I would call her the main antagonist in the movie and her husband was too good for a skanky woman like her? The remake addressed and eliminated most of these negative points?the wife was much more sympathetic and her behavior more bearable? unlike Dustin Hoffman who seemed to be barely tolerating Susan George, James Marsden and Kate Bosworth acted realistically like a couple in love?the creeps were genuinely creepy, their behavior intimidating at times and their contempt towards the supposed wimpiness of the husband was barely concealed beneath a veneer of politeness?I could easily imagine myself in the shoes of the various characters and identify with them all? The intimidation and harassment aspect was better brought out in the 2011 version?it starts out subtly by having the workmen gang turning up for work far too early in the morning, blasting loud music, grabbing beer bottles from the refrigerator randomly, requesting for permission to leave work early... steps up relentlessly to the leering catcalls at a jogging Bosworth?and finally the hanging of the cat and the double rape?scenes where Chris asks Mr. Summer which movies he has written scripts for and Charlie warning David over walking out of the church sermon helped to build up tension between the characters...these were not present in the original version.The only aspects that the original scores over the remake is that Dustin Hoffman is much more of a nerdy and diminutive guy than James Marsden?you could relate to Hoffman as a guy who would have been constantly bullied and pushed around since his school days?but not so much with the muscle-bound, square-jawed Marsden (even if he wears spectacles to look nerdy)?and the final battle in the original movie was more edgy and realistic then the newer version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like death and taxes, nothing in this world is certain anymore except that if a movie in the past made more than its cost, it will be remade.Somebody once remarked that as far as movies were concerned, the United States consisted of three part: New York City, the South, and the rest of the country. Sam Pekinpah's original was set in Cornwall or some Godforsaken place and pitted no-goodniks against a weak mathematician and his sluttish wife.The remake moves the story to where it always belong, in the rural South. English farm boys are just no substitute for the ranting James Woods and his gang of sullen, smirking redneck hoods.The husband, James Marsden, is no longer a mathematician. There's no particular reason why he's become a novelist or playwright here. Maybe the screenwriters thought that mathematics was the sort of enterprise that was too difficult for the audience, who might turn away in disgust.Aside from that, Dustin Hoffman was better casting than Marsden. Hoffman had virtually no shoulders and is short, whereas Marsden has the fully developed figure of an adult male. But he doesn't compare to the chief villain, Alexander Skarsgard, who is taller than anyone else and who, in his many shirtless scenes, we notice has been working out to the extent that his muscles have muscles. Nobody in the original was a behemoth.Yet, there is more ambiguity in this film, at least as far as Skarsgard's heavy is concerned. He's an ex boyfriend of Marsden's provocative wife, Kate Bosworth. At the climactic orgasm of violence, he seems genuinely intent on protecting her from the other drunken louts. This hasn't stopped him from raping her and allowing one of his buddies to sodomize her earlier.It's not a terrible movie, not for a remake. But, as is the case with almost all remakes, the original has been taken and shot full of Dexedrine. Everything is faster and louder. And if Pekinpah used some very short flashbacks, the director here uses dozens of them, instantaneous. Some of the second-long inserts are pointless. The camera wobbles as if being held by a man having a stroke in his psychomotor gyrus. That's pandering to today's impatient adolescent audiences who want more blood, sex, and mayhem. I'm subtracting a point or two from the rating because of its message -- kill 'em all and let God sort 'em out -- and the means of its conveyance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary remake, probably... But not a flop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen the first, 1971 version of Straw Dogs, but the cast then seems more "ripe" and versatile as in the current movie. The leading performers - James Marsden as David Sumner and Kate Bosworth as Amy Sumner - seem rather mediocre, Alexander Skarsg?rd as Charlie Venner and James Woods as "Coach" Tom Heddon are much more memorable. The plot is uneven, 1st half is protracted, the final events in the house are too contrasty and doubtful at times. On the other hand, similar things might easily happen in stuffy and far-away places where locals consider outsiders as endangers of their routines and attitudes. The same happens in my country where clashes between urban visitors/settlers and local rural people are easy to provoke - and there are always booze and women involved. Straw Dogs 2011 is OK for killing time, but do not expect a masterpiece or strong team of actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great but really, not that bad either...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read some of the reviews I have to say I really didn't think this movie was as bad as many seem to think it was. Was it great, no...it wasn't, but then I also haven't seen the original and I'm glad of it. I hate when people try to compare "remakes" instead of trying to watch the movie on it's own. Having said that I will say that there were several plot-holes and inconsistencies but that's the fault of the writers, not the actors. The only characters I found that I really became invested in was Charlie (Alexander Skarsgard did a great job playing a character you loved to hate) and Jeremy (Dominic Purcell made you love and sympathize with this character.) I wish I could have said the same thing about Kate Bosworth in this movie, but really...I can't blame her, I blame the writer for her characters inconsistencies in behavior.I won't go into a whole synopsis of this movie and how it failed to make me like it better than I did but I will say, I did find myself drawn in and paying attention to the movie. Which is more than many movies do these days...I also watched it more than once, strictly for Skaarsgard &amp; Purcell's performances.) Give it a chance and don't compare it to another flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seemed like this movie was out to give rednecks a bad name. Not everyone who grows up in the south acts like these guys did. As a matter of fact, I didn't buy the whole story because these guys grew up with Amy and I don't think would act like that.The movie is about Amy and her new husband, David, going back to her hometown to live. He's a writer and more sophisticated than the locals. She has a hot ex, Charlie, that they hire to finish the roof on their barn. He uses his redneck friends to help him. Well, she's running around in skimpy clothes complaining to her husband that the workers are giving her "looks". David tells her to put some clothes on then. Things escalate between them all and finally they harbor the town pervert in their home. The guys come wanting him and all hell breaks loose. And David finds out he has a lot more in him than he ever thought.FINAL VERDICT: It was fair, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it.</fullReview>

We thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. It was action from the start, bit gruesome at times, but that's what you'd expect from a rating of 18. I thought the story was really believable, a bit far fetched but it is a movie. Great acting Great action Worth watching You won't be disappointed. I thought James Marsden and Kate Bosworth were great in this, but i think they're both great actors anyway.

		<shortDescription>Not Bad, But Won't Make Anyone Forget the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Straw Dogs is a remake of a controversial film from the 70s directed by Sam Peckinpah and starring Dustin Hoffman. The 2011 version, directed by Rod Lurie with James Marsden filling in for Hoffman, takes the basic plot from the earlier picture and transplants it from the English countryside to the American South. Peckinpah's film was controversial back in the day not only for its incredible violence, but for what it seemed to say about the role of violence in society. The 2011 film, though just as violent, doesn't seem to have resonated like the original. The reason, I think, is that while the 2011 Straw Dogs is competently made, it doesn't really have anything to say.The plot: screenwriter David Sumner (Marsden) and his beautiful wife Amy (Kate Bosworth) return to Amy's family home in Blackwater, Mississippi. Blackwater is a lot different from California, and though David tries hard to fit in, he never seems to say or do the right thing as far his new neighbors are concerned. In Blackwater, football is king, everyone but David drives a beat-up used car or truck, nobody can finish a complete sentence without swearing, and real men like to shoot deer and cut their antlers off while the animal is still alive. Everyone in Blackwater is ostensibly Christian, though that doesn't seem to allay their violent streaks very much, and of course David is quite non-religious. In short, David is the proverbial fish out of water.And then the problems start. Amy's former high school boyfriend, Charlie, apparently isn't willing to let his old sweetheart (whom he affectionately refers to as "AmyCakes") go. As an act of goodwill, David hires Charlie and his friends to do some work around the place, but they don't seem to take the job very seriously. As Charlie's advances toward Amy become more intense and their disdain for David more callous, an inevitable showdown gradually begins to build. And when David ultimately chooses to take in a mentally retarded local who may or may not have done something to a teenage girl, the fight is on. Charlie and his friends lay siege to David's house, and the very non-violent David must fight for his life, and the life of his wife. "If they get in," he tells Amy near the end, "we're dead." It's all a stirring suspense film, and in most respects well done. Marsden handles the role of David well, though he's not quite as believable as the bookish nerd as Hoffman was. Kate Bosworth is a versatile actress who shows good dramatic range as David's victimized but strong wife. Alexander Skarsgard is suitably threatening as the bully Charlie, who honestly doesn't seem to understand how Amy could possibly prefer David to him. The script does have some holes, and leaves a few too many questions left unanswered (especially in the final act), but it is rarely boring.But the backbone of the original film is missing. The new film doesn't really offer any kind of commentary on violence or its place in society. Director Lurie seems most concerned with simply crafting a good thriller, and in that respect he is successful. But the Peckinpah version was a thriller and more, and asked some disturbing questions. If there is anything genuinely disturbing about the new film, it is the realization that apparently Hollywood still thinks everyone in the South is a barbarian. Even David's transformation from milksop to killer lacks gravity and happens too quickly.Really, if you are fan of the original movie, there's no reason to see the remake. If you haven't, then you might want to rent the new film if you're in the mood for an interesting suspense movie that will most likely excite you without stimulating much thought. Though hardly a flop, 2011's Straw Dogs does fail to live up to its pedigree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, I knew nothing about this movie prior to renting it. I haven't cared for Kate Bosworth, as most people, but like James Marsden and definitely like Alexander S from watching True Blood.As a woman, I obviously didn't care for the rape scene, but I've definitely seen much worse in other films (The Last House on the Left) It really wasn't all that disturbing, comparitively speaking. I did find it extremely odd that she doesn't tell her husband about it though. What was that about? The husband plays a real puss through the entire movie up until the last scene. Man up and take control! The fact the she walks around without a bra with all the workers around was absolutely ridiculous, especially jogging with ut a bra Come on!!! There's no real story here and the pale one that exists is beyond terrible. The only reason I gave a 5/10 is because Alexander S. takes his shirt off. Sorry people, but that's how I feel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this file. One of the main reasons was because the remake remained fairly faithful to the original. They changed locations and job titles of the participants, but for the most part if you saw the first one you know what is going to happen in this one. Now for some, that would be a fatal flaw, but I enjoyed it probably because the first one was so good. I really did not see the reason for a remake, but if your going to do it, it should be recognizable as the original. The acting was decent, it would be hard to duplicate Dustin Hoffman's original work, but this was well done. I particularly liked the portrayal of the protagonists, probably done better than the original. And the James Woods character is fantastic, I think it makes the movie.For me the biggest disappointment in this movie was Kate Bosworth. Its a shame because I generally like her work but in this case, I never got into her character. You need to know the relationship between the husband and wife. I had read some previews of this movie, and was told that the wife was going be portrayed as more of an independent feminist in this film but you sure couldn't tell that from this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of the classic 1971 version, as I like a remake to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched, again, back to back famous titles, Straw Dogs 1971 and 2011. The settings (locations) are an ocean and hemisphere apart as well as 40 years but are in their period equally good; the ratings do not do justice to the remake, in my honest but not very humble opinion.The storyline appears on the surface to be quite similar to the original, but I find they are not; the Scots and the Southerners have very distinct characters and are not of the same temperament, which means different mores and different behavior towards women (one of the key aspect of the scripts). There were many lines which are exactly the same in both versions and scenes as well and the characters' names are identical, so we could be influenced to think the story is the same. Watching back to back versions makes it easier to distinguish the nuances from the differences. In some instances all we have are nuances, and in the remake there are both nuances and clear differences. The relation between Amy and David is not as strained in the remake, a plus for some viewers and not so much for others. The rape scene, in the original is somewhat ambiguous as we are left with doubts as to Amy's true feelings; she is ravished by both men but repealed only with Charlie, whereas in the remake she is assaulted and feels violated equally by both men and puts up a strong resistance to both. This is not just a nuance to me.In the series of assault on the couple's home in the original, Amy is steadfast against David's conviction that the protection of Niles is necessary, while in the remake Amy is supportive for the most part and definitely not putting up much opposition to the principal involved. Tom, played by James Woods, in the remake is far more aggressive and his motives for the harassment of Niles are clear and very culturally different. The remake takes advantage of the race factor with regard to the sheriff, clearly not a factor in the original.What I look for in a remake is substantial differences in both development of the characters and overall style; the latter to be fitting to its period in time and place. This remake had sufficient differences, not substantial, in the character development but the style was what I was hoping for in the Deep South setting. The character of David, as played by James Marsden, had an obviously different demeanor than that played by Hoffman and this was necessary. I was pleased by his performance.Susan George is not of the acting caliber of Kate Bosworth and so that was a significant plus for the remake, though I'll admit Susan George' body was more fitting for the role, considering Amy is somewhat of a temptress. The remake had a more substantial part for Tom played by James Woods. I'm a James Woods fan. The cinematography in the remake is very appealing, no comparison to the original; after all it's in the South where the sun shines and not Scotland where the weather is mostly gloomy. The final scenes of the assault on the couple's home were taking full advantage of the improvements in special effects over the past 40 years. I don't agree with the bland rating of the remake. I score the original higher than the remake on account of originality and Dustin Hoffman; I surely score the remake higher than the general ratings. Everyone is entitled to their opinion but that doesn't mean one is better than an other unless it's argued correctly; I did not find much of that in the reviews preceding this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Straw DogsWhen moving to the Southern United States it's important to bring along a regional guidebook, i.e. The Bible.And while the relocating couple in this thriller didn't pack one, the locals are happy to teach them their backwater ways.When David (James Marsden), a scriptwriter from California, moves to Mississippi to restore his wife's (Kate Bosworth) ancestral home and finish his script, he butts heads with her high school boyfriend (Alexander Skarsg?rd) and his cronies, whom he has hired to repair the barn roof.As the problem escalates between David and his contractor, so too do issues between him and his wife, culminating in a home invasion and multiple murders.A worthy re-make of the 1971 original, Straw Dogs is slow to simmer, but when it boils the tension is palpable. Besides, the only thing that you should be hiring your wife's ex-lover to fix is your leaky septic tank. (Yellow Light)vidiotreviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of Sam Peckinpah's highly controversial 1971 film of the same name, 'Straw Dogs' turns out to be an effective remake, that offers shock value &amp; modernization. It even succeeds by once again re-creating the eerie atmosphere, which the original had.'Straw Dogs' Synopsis: L.A. screenwriter David Sumner relocates with his wife to her hometown in the deep South. There, while tensions build between them, a brewing conflict with locals becomes a threat to them both.'Straw Dogs' in the 1970's was highly controversial &amp; was considered to be gory. In 2011, 'Straw Dogs', as a story, still holds shock value. The sadistic behavior of it's characters &amp; their actions, still can you give the repulsion they might have given you back then. And, Even Though the Rape Scene here isn't that graphic or depressing as compared to the original, it's the culmination here, that leaves you disturbed. It's absolutely gruesome &amp; very off-putting. Rod Lurie's Take on 'Straw Dogs', as a writer &amp; filmmaker, is as twisted as it should be. He understands the mood of the film accurately &amp; has handled the film commendably. Alik Sakharov's Cinematography is absorbing. Editing is sharp. Art Design is fine. Performance-Wise: James Marsden plays the leading man, very interestingly. He very manipulatively transforms his character from a coward to a beast, which is truly applaudable. Kate Bosworth is fantastic in her part. Alexander Skarsg?rd scores. James Woods is spell-binding in a role, that is probably the scariest in here. Dominic Purcell, Rhys Coiro &amp; Billy Lush are convincing. Willa Holland is decent. On the whole, 'Straw Dogs' is an effective look-back to one of the most controversial films form the 1970's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nostalgic Classic Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering how the original Straw Dogs came out in a much different societal climate era to where it was censored and banned from theaters at the time for being "too violent/explicit," this remake could only update the material content. That was how things were in the 70's and the hippies were still strong in America. There is no other Dustin Hoffman or Susan George, that's for sure, but this film did a fair job in casting. With the way violence and rape content is blasted in our face today, this remake simply was not able to capture the same essence and nuances as the original. Even if a now era viewer were to watch the original film, due to be desensitized with so much violence and sexual content in media today, I doubt that it would have much of an impact.My vote is a bit influenced from having lived in the time period when the original film was done, so my viewing this film I had a feeling of nostalgia accompanying my senses. Some films like this simply cannot match the original due to the nostalgia factor. However, this film is worth at least a one-time viewing since it is rather good, entertaining and well done. Not a blockbuster, but worth watching. With that said, I do recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's always sad when people lower a movie just because its a remake. This is a brilliant and smart modernization of the 1971 movie that stays true to the initial story and message. There is NOTHING wrong with any of the acting.-Can't be compared to "insert any old accomplished actor"- That's the typical boring argument made on any remake and it lacks logic even in its-self. If this one would have been made first, people would argue exactly the same way. The only thing you could really criticize, is that making a remake is close enough to taking somebody else's work and selling it as your own. But nobody does that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Joy in Blackwater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie Review: "Straw Dogs" ? A scene-for-scene remake of the 1971 Sam Pekinpah film which featured Dustin Hoffman and Susan George. This time around James Marsden and Kate Bosworth are David and Amy Sumner; two L.A. socialites who have returned to Amy's childhood hometown of Blackwater in the Deep South. David, a writer, has come to Blackwater to find the peace and quiet that he requires to finish his novel. In an attempt to appease some of the local redneck hillbillies, David tries to extend the proverbial olive branch and hires them to re-roof their barn. As the tension between the Sumners and the locals escalates, the town of Blackwater becomes unhinged as a local 15 year old girl goes missing. The prime suspect is Nils, a local retarded man and the town's registered sexual offender. Nils finds refuge with the Sumners after he was injured while actually fleeing the scene of the crime. However, as the film reaches its climax and mob mentality begins to reign?. David Sumner, after being emasculated all film, finally decides to make his stand and fight back. I didn't care much for the original 1971 film, and this remake isn't much better; however, kudos to the last 15 minutes of this film. The battle sequence at the end of the film is both graphic and gruesome; two aspects I really enjoy. However, my main issue with the film is that Nils was actually guilty. I really believe that writers of this film could have easily found a better reason for David to make a stand than protecting Nils from mob justice (maybe his wife's virtue for instance). Either way, a "just cause" would have definitely made the ending sequence much more enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David (Marsden) and Amy (Bosworth) Sumner go back to her father's house in her home town so David can write his movie in peace and quiet.Remember when Thomas Wolfe said you can't go home again? What he really meant to say was that you really shouldn't go back to your new wife's home town where she was a popular cheerleader and the old football team is still hanging out and still have eyes for her. Straw Dogs rear their heads again. You know what will be coming, right?Well, things do go that way later on but keep in mind that David is not a Mel Gibson or Liam Neeson character when push comes to shove. Amy is aware of this and does some things to get David to man-up to keep the locals (some of the old football team), who are putting a new roof on his barn, in place. Of course, you now know where this is going. So get the popcorn and get ready for the grand finale when David and Amy do all they can to protect their home. No, the Mel Gibson and Neeson characters don't show up like you would expect, but David does okay.This has loads of tension and suspense throughout and, in time, you will be riveted to your seat when the house comes under siege. You know Amy has a gun in the bedroom and you will keep yelling at David to go get it. (I heard you yelling) He knows where it is. Amy knows where it is. I know where it is and I kept yelling (told you) at that stupid David to get the stupid gun! Ahhhh, if they would only listen!I understand this is a remake and for my money, this has the old one beat. I don't care what you say how good the original was, this is better. I just know it. (they say the old one was pretty good) HA! This is better. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, there is a rape scene. Nudity: No. Language: Yes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very memorable. Possible Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't really want to see this film, but a friend invited me along to the advance screening. This may be a tad bit spoilerish as far as character description.First thing that bugged me about the film was that it was very slow. Way too much time was spent setting up the characters. I found that I disliked Marsden and Bosworth's characters. He was rude and arrogant, and she was bratty and played with men. The 'straw dogs' in the film were obviously not likable. The only people I did like were very minor characters and Purcell's character (at first). But Purcell was definitely an bad casting choice for a mentally disabled person.Everyone just acted to oddly in it. Things characters did were so over the top and left unresolved that it annoyed me. I would go in depth but I don't want to give too much away.Like I said the film was slow, it didn't get anywhere until about 3/4 into the film. Then when Marsden's character finally does all the cool stuff you see in the trailer, it goes by too fast. Then BOOM, movies over. You don't find out if anything gets resolved.The scenes you see in the trailer don't disappoint. There are some cringe-worthy moments, but they were so fast, blink and you miss them.I give it a 5/10 because there were some good kill moments, but it wasn't anything that memorable. I wouldn't recommend going out and seeing it the day it comes out. More like a dollar-saver theater kind of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the husband is made of straw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>straw dogs is the remake of the 1971 classic starring academy award winning actor Dustin Hoffman. its about a city wimpy husband David from the suburbs who is a writer for movies and his wife Amy who is a country girl in Mississippi coming back to her hometown. in this town everyone there is family. they stay close and there is a lot of trust. so much trust people don't even lock there doors. thats a lot of trust. anyway David hired a worker to take care of a roof on a woodshed after the hurricane. just so happens one of the men working for him was the ex boyfriend of Amy's named Charlie. hes jealous and he wants her back, but then becomes dangerous around her. and David does not defend Amy, he ignores it and pretends it doesn't bother him. he avoiding confrontation and Amy doesn't appreciate it. then it gets worse. but ill let you see it. anyway this movie has a great plot and has great potential. sadly it falls short and isn't as entertaining as the original. there is no entertainment toward it. the plot falls short and the acting is horrible. other than James woods. he is the drunk former coach of a high school football team which is a big deal in a small town like that. anyway he is very protective of his daughter especially because she likes a mentally ill man. its not very good. even if it wasn't a remake it wouldn't change a thing. the action was good at the end and James woods was the shining performance in the film. so my recommendation. don't see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah's original classic is one of my favorite thrillers. So when I heard they were remaking "Straw dogs", I wasn't surprised but somewhat leery of having high expectations. But once I read the casting and saw the trailer, I became excited for the remake. I was not let down. "Straw Dogs" is one of the most intense films I've seen in years."Straw Dogs" (2011) did right, what so many other remakes do wrong. It didn't alter the story drastically or disrespect the original's legacy. The director simply rebooted and modernized the tale for a new generation. Everything that shocked you and every scene you loved in the original is still in the remake. The change of setting actually benefited the film and gave it a little more realism in terms of violence and social dysfunction.The violence is high and the rape scene is disturbing. But the acting was top notch by everyone involved. James Marsden did a great job playing the weak, timid, and quiet intellectual who eventually turns into the strong, violent, and "manly" protector. His performance was very "Hoffman" essque but he still made the role his own. I think a lot of girls came to the film solely for Alexander Skarsgard (true blood fans) and they were generally disturbed by his turn as a heel. There were a lot of gasps during a particular bear trap scene. Bosworth, Woods, and Purcell were all perfect in their roles as well."Straw Dogs" is as raw, interesting, and powerful as it's original. A film that deals with aggression, manhood, and human connections pushed to the extremes. There are many subtleties in the performances and some great metaphorical images. A great thriller that literally intensifies until it's satisfying climax. Best film I've seen in months.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everyone Has a Breaking Point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STRAW DOGS is a remake of the 1971 thriller of the same name by director Peckinpah and is surprisingly similar to the original. It's about a couple, David and Amy, who moves to Mississippi in order for David to finish his screenplay in a remote, quiet area. When the couple needs their run-down barn to be fixed, they hire a group on constructors, one of who is Amy's ex-boyfriend, Charlie, from way back when. From then on, a conflict begins to grow between the couple and the workers as a series of escalating events start to take place. There's also a heated subplot involving the town's mentally-handicapped Jeremy and the retired coach, Tom, in which we don't know the importance of until later on in the film.As a remake, STRAW DOGS retains the ambiguous nature that made the original so great. For example, look at the film's main villain, Charlie: David calls Charlie and his friends a bunch of "straw dogs," which he explains to be ceremonial objects that were used in China. During the ceremony, the straw dogs were dressed and looked up upon, but once the ceremony was over, they would be thrown away and forgotten. In essence, what David is trying to say is that Charlie used to be big and famous several years ago, but now he's just another insignificant person in the town, and we see that in the scene where Charlie first sees Amy. He still likes her and wants to rekindle their love. One can argue that the bad and evil decisions Charlie makes is because he knows he's not important anymore, and all he wants is to win Amy back. As you can see, Charlie isn't your typical two dimensional villain.The other more obvious issue regarding the film's ambiguous nature is the character of David. Throughout the film, David is pressured into being "a man," like Charlie and his friends. Even his wife tells him to step up as he failed to take things into his own hands. We can see that he's a nice person, and he doesn't want to "get in a fray," as he says in one scene. But the film's main theme can be seen in the tagline: Everyone has a breaking point. Inevitably, we see the change in David as the film reaches towards its conclusion. With all that being said, yes, I think the remake handled the ambiguity really well, and it's obvious the film holds much respect for the original.However, in order for the film to work, the actor playing David's character must be up to the task, and that's where the film falls short on. I think James Marsden is a good actor in general. However, I was hesitant to see if he could play the character as effectively as Dustin Hoffman did in the original. Marsden played the good, civil side of David really well. Marsden is likable, so it's no surprise that he could pull that off. However, he wasn't good playing the dark side of the character, and that flaw alone really makes the film disappointing as a whole and the explosive, climatic battle a little...off. If they could have gotten a better actor to play David, then I have no doubt the film could be as good as the original.Fortunately, the supporting players are much better. Kate Bosworth is very good in her role as the wife, in which her character goes through hell. James Woods, who plays the coach, is very effective as being scary when he's drunk and violent and even worse with the combination of the two. However, the real star is Alexander Skarsg?rd, who plays the intimidating Charlie. He brings depth and complexity into what could have been a forgettable villain. Lastly, I'd like to mention Dominic Purcell, who plays the Jeremy, but not because he's good. In fact, I thought he was miscasted playing a mentally-handicapped person because his performance felt over-the-top.Overall, STRAW DOGS is a well made film and is more respectful to its original source compared to other remakes. However, Marsden couldn't pull off the transformation of David, and, as a result, that really does bring the effectiveness of the film down quite a bit even though the rest of the cast are on top of their game. If you're interested in seeing this film, I'd say to go out and rent the original version starring Dustin Hoffman instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avoid - see the 1971 version instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the worst remake of a classic movie, ever. Sam Peckinpah's original was great: gritty, atmosphere-laden, slow-burning, engrossing. This remake, directed by a nobody, is everything but that. Paint-by- numbers direction, with no intrigue at all. Characters are one- dimensional and much of the sub-plots and scenes seem contrived.The performances don't help. James Marsden is particularly irritating in the male lead role, while Kate Bosworth is just there as eye candy, I guess, and even at that she is so-so. When you realise that the original had the brilliant Dustin Hoffman and Susan George and this has James Who? and (B-grade at best) Kate Bosworth, then you know the remake isn't going to be much good. Alexander Skarsgard is reasonably good in his role, and James Woods is OK. Supporting cast are terrible.Do yourself a favour: see the 1971 original Straw Dogs instead.</fullReview>

It also comes with some very gripping scenes so overall I think its worth a watch exspecially if you are a horror fan.This movie is about a young writer and his wife who go to a cabin in the woods for some peace and quite. They run into some locals at the gas station which seem nice at first but then start to give them problems, small at first but slowly escalating.This movie was nothing special and some of the actors were not great but it is no where near as bad as some people say it is.

		<fullReview>"Straw Dogs" is one of those movies that I wasn't interested in at first (when I happened to see the trailer in the movie theater). But as I thought about it, and also realized this was a remake of an interesting premise, I decided to give it a try. Now this isn't exactly original material we're dealing with. The movie is familiar territory, it's just that the packaging is different. In other words: the movie's plot unfolds before it gets to the good stuff. James Marsden and Kate Bosworth are a couple who have no idea that the men working right across from them aren't who they appear to be. Until they discover a dead (and strangled) dog (or cat, I don't remember) in their closet, nothing is at stake. At least not to them. Whether you prefer something conventional or not, give this one a try.**1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

An American husband???? Which genius came up with that idea. If this movie had have had a British scriptwriter husband it would have been a masterpiece or sorts. American hubby destroyed it for me. All I could think of was Orlando Bloom or Ewan McGregor in the role. Everything would have been superb with a British protagonist instead of James Marsden, all the scenes would have played out perfectly and the audience would have been far more compelled. It was too hard to distinguish between the locals and the new kid in town. Even Dustin Hoffman was an American in a British town with a British wife. This remake should have been UK husband with U.S. wife in backwater U.S. town. You'd think Hollywood would have some standards with all that money being thrown around..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie just did not sit well with me from the beginning. I felt my toe curling as I was watching the set up. The story is basically home town girl, who had 15 minutes of fame, is back in town with Hollywood writer boyfriend, who knows nothing about the south and good ole boy ways. The main character was the only decent, but very stereotypical. Nerdy guy wanting to fit in even though he can't stand the people he is trying to fit in with. To me, the plot was very typical with no twist.(I was hoping in the end the husband killed the cat.)The last 15 minutes of the movie are what gave it a five for me, especially the bear trap scene. The rest of the movie was just "blah". Like many people wrote "Did she get raped by her old boyfriend or was she ashamed she cheated on her husband. Obviously the second guy raped her because in the end she like shoots him three times while leaving the other guy alone then at the end she just stands there looking at him with a bear trap on his head. Like your husband just kills five guys who where trying to kill you, and your not trying to make out with him or show him so freakin gratitude. What a B****!I noticed a lot of people said she deserved what she got because she was wearing s shirt you could see her tits through ans then flashed the guys in the roof. But if you notice the director sort of makes it out that way; it's even alluded to with the line: "you reap what you sow". Not that I agree with the fact she was raped due to how you dress, but the point made you do attract flies with honey. You will notice she no longer wears anymore skimpy outfits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cross-cutting Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Straw Dogs is a dark, menacing, can't-look-away psychological thriller. The characters are what make this film shine. David, our hero, is a hip screenwriter from Los Angeles who just entered a world only explored on paper in his screenplays, and he doesn't even know it. He is full of flavor and in love with his actress wife, Amy, a former resident of this world who escaped for higher ground. David and Amy are opposites. David is cowardly yet industrious, in love with his wife yet in love with his vocabulary. Amy is strong yet submissive, in love with her husband, yet in love with her arrogance. When a crew of locals win the bid to nail on a new roof on Amy's old house, a bubble begins to grow. David has to stand up to his wife, to the locals, to his own weakness to survive in this film. There is great contrast between his world, an agnostic, realistic world, and that of the southern locals. The problem for these locals, these "Straw Dogs," is that their community is finished with them when they stop holding a football and start holding a hammer.This adaptation to the American South is just as convincing as the 1971 film set in rural England. The film-making is tight and uses some wonderful techniques to externalize the struggle plaguing these characters. Quick cuts of the chaotic high school football game drip with terror, showing us the pain that Amy is feeling. I particularly like the cross-cutting between the hunting scene and the scene of Amy's despair.Many films jump days, months, or even years in time. Straw Dogs does not, which is why I like it. Particularly, the last 30 minutes of the film play out in near real-time as the bubble bursts sending fire into the air. In this 30 minutes, you will experience the destruction of man. As David says "if they get in here, we're dead." One of my all-times favorite films (1971 version) remade into a modern classic. -Jonathan Sturak 04/04/2012</fullReview>

After reading all the hype about the original and how good it is I decided to watch it and I was disappointed. The main reason for writing this review it to state that it's better than the original! Miles better! Don't listen to what other nostalgic fans of the original are saying, they are living in the past and do not appreciate this movie for what it really is. There is no need to compare it with the original, put it in it's own spotlight and you'll have a great movie experience.</fullReview>

It's a story of a girl who moves back home with her new hubby and all the old high school football players get jealous. It was a total waste of money, and the script did not make any of the character's believable. It also felt like they tried to make a movie that was suppose to be 4 hours long fit into an hour time slot.

		<shortDescription>STRAW DOGS is a gripping thriller, in the same vein as THE STRANGERS or LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT (Remake)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every year, a home invasion/rape thriller comes out into the theaters. STRAW DOGS felt a lot like the 2011 version of I Spit On Your Grave. A young couple (Kate Bosworth and James Marsden) move to Amy's (Kate Bosworth) hometown to stay at her family's old house, while screenplay writer, David (James Marsden) finishes writing his newest project.As soon as they arrive, Amy discovers that her old town wasn't exactly how she left it. While at a restaurant, they meet up with Amy's old friends from high school. David hires them to take on a household project.Soon, tensions rise and that's where all the horror starts. Many events happen, leading up to a brutal home invasion. When I say brutal, I mean this is a BRUTAL home invasion. It borrows from FUNNY GAMES, in which the young couple is terrorized by strange assailants, seemingly for no reason. Also, the record player idea was something we saw in 2008's THE STRANGERS.Overall, this was a good movie for fans of the sub-genre of home invasion. WARNING: THERE IS A RAPE!!!! It's not for everyone, but it kept me entertained on a Friday night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ATTENTION!!!This review could be considered a spoiler! ATTENTION "L.A. screenwriter David Sumner relocates with his wife to her hometown in the deep South. There, while tensions build between them, a brewing conflict with locals becomes a threat to them both." This description of the movie is completely misleading. If you want to see a husband that convinces his wife (who has had extreme emotional experiences there and would never want to go back) to go back to a town she was from; criticize for leaving church, insinuate how the town is some crazed religious group, have the wife and husbands home invaded, cat hung in the closet, the wife forcefully raped by two locals (who she knew from the past and one she accuses of killing her father). Then, see the main characters from the town kill a sheriff of color (with implicating racism), the movie portray the town folk as ignorant red necks. Then, see wife/rape victim (who has not told her husband that she had been raped yet) try to get over the trauma of her rape and insinuated troubled past in this town, fight back with her husband to save another character (who is mentally challenged and constantly is put under physical/emotional abuse. then have the story imply the husbands actions are a breaking point and now his actions during the end of the story's events some how make him a man.This is a movie I would never see never see with a girlfriend or wife, If this story exists in real life (and I bet there is something close) Any women that knew that town would not go back there except to sell the inheritance/property and never return. It is a movie I would not ever want to see again and if the above quoted description was articulated correctly/rationally, I would not have watched it at all. The two best thing's about this movie is that you can just say no to watching it or, if you were unaware it was being put on, turn it off. To the men readers of this commentary; If you are smart you will not watch this with your wife, girlfriend, mother etc... The only thing a sane women would think about this movie is sadness, fear, empathy as well as hate. That is what I get from it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen the original but I must say that this one was fantastic. It starts out kind of slow which was a good thing because you get to know the characters. It starts out kinda happy like most movies do but once the tension starts you honestly can't look away its like reading a book that you can't put down.Once the tension starts to take off, its just like you are the main character it is just like you are in his shoes, and it puts you in a state of mind of what would you do if that happened to you, which is absolutely brilliant.The movie is also very brutal and violent but when the villains are trying to break into the house it makes you root for him because the guys are so insane and their actions are totally uncalled for, like when they rape the main characters wife, which I found disturbing, and you pretty much want to shout at him to kill them because they are crazy and need to get what they deserve, which is another reason why this film is so brilliant because it pretty much makes you talk to the screen.Not only is the movie great but the cast if actor were very great, for example James Woods' character was absolutely fantastic his character in this film is very menacing and alittle scary at times its just and all around great movie with a solid cast and lots edge of your seat material.The only problem I had was that during the final scenes the lighting was kind of bad and I found it hard to see what was going on at a few moments. Other than that it was a fantastic film and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

I feel the most frustrating part of this film, for me, was all the unanswered questions that came to mind once the end credits started to roll. For example, why was Jeremy not allowed to be around young girls? I suppose you can fill in the blanks, but nothing in the film actually explains anything about it. Also, what happened to the Coach's daughter, Janice?? Why did Amy change the date that was written on the blackboard from 1943 to 1944?? Why didn't Amy tell David that she was raped by Charlie?? Why didn't David even find out about it whatsoever?? This film is a basic, run-of-the-mill thriller, nothing psychologically complex for the audience to figure out or interpret, so why the lack of explanations?? This film felt like a big jumbled mess. For that reason alone, I give Straw Dogs a 1/10..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without comparisons, nevertheless a poor movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STORYLINE As a person that watches really tons of movies per month, i acquired a certain taste in movies. Let's see the storyline Talking about the storyline, it is quite poor. The happenings are really few and would perhaps deserve a short movie. The time/importance given to some events is or really too long or definitely too short. It's all about time-events management, that in this movie is actually quite roughly made.CHARACTERS The most important thing of a character, is the "roundness". The development in a movie can also not exist in a personality, i admit "flat" or "clichet" or "semi-stereotype" thugs, that have a function but are really well made.Here all we got are guys with huge neon lights on the head "ex cheerleader of the town", "jerk city addicted necrotic professor", "dangerous menacing bully".Oh come on this is really childish. i could see from the first precise moment that appeared the face of a person, who he could have been, what he would have done.Moreover, the dresses were like uniforms. The redneck wet-no-arm t-shirt, the thin see- nipple-through vest of the good-looking woman... oh PLEASE.This is predictable. If we all liked watching "The Teletubbies" and we were 3 years old kids, perhaps we would really appreciate this feature, but for grown up human beings, i define it quite "ANNOYING"Without spoiling, i want to invite all the people to observe the Woman's behavior. Absolutely and unreasonably ambivalent, with no real function. There is non sense and non sense. This is just another neon light "i am sexually unsatisfied!". i simply had problems in understanding the stupidity of many actions or speeches made by the characters. No way they looked convincing. ARTISTIC REALIZATIONphoto, camera corners, landscapes...props... well all right, nothing to say. nothing special but fine.CONCLUSIONSimply watch it if you want to have confirms that you can recognize the movie stereotype. it is a guessing game for dummies. If you want mind puzzling, action thrilling, artistic or philosophic scenes,FORGET ABOUT IT. this is a simple movie for simple minds, with nothing special, and some irritating features.Borrow it from a friend, don't buy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror Reviews: Straw Dogs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forgive me, i am the worst kind of horror movie enthusiast- I see a trailer on television for an upcoming release and i can't help but get giddy and declare "I want to see that!" without having any idea aside from the trailers; which are often misleading- what the movie is about.Thats my biggest problem as a movie viewer, critic, and person- in the case of 2011's Straw Dogs, this also led to a level of embarrassment on a first date, but we will get into that later.Unlike most people in the industry i like the idea of remakes- I actually believe they do more good then harm for a movie, because a second attempt can often allow a story to live up to its full potential. On a very hypocritical note sometimes i feel like if it is not broken don't fix it, or if it doesn't need to exist don't create it. I get very frustrated when i try to sort out my genuine feelings on this. I am glad however "Straw Dogs" is a remake, it is a good remake - because the original was released in 1971 and even though that was an enlightening period for the thriller horror genre; there are certain things we get away with in film now, that in the 70's would be considered pornography. Don't get me wrong i do not advocate the rape sequence that Straw Dog's was made infamous for in the 1971 Dam Peckinpah original, and its almost morbid to think that in here in 2011, Rob Lurie the remakes director, thought to himself "hmmm how can we make this horrific rape-scene better" I am actually joking- because i don't think this was his intention when remaking this film. Consider this. In 1971, a movie was made famous simply because it even "contained" a graphic rape scene. Here in 2011 when we are a much more desensitized audience; a movie that happens to have a scene of that nature will still be considered for its other content. Straw Dogs, as a story is actually much more then an upsetting five minutes where a man's seemingly innocent wife is brutally gang raped in her living room- Now i am setting myself up to make a brutal argument, how can i advocate a film like this! Well lets consider genre; Straw Dogs is not a horror-horror, its more of a psycho thriller- and it takes a long time before anything brutal or sadistic to actually occur. Most of the films graphic slash and kill moments are compacted into the last thirty-some minutes. The majority of the movie introduces the audience to the close-minded social politics of a sadistic small town, Blackwater Mississippi. David Summer (James Marsden) is an unwanted outsider and when he and his wife Amy (Kate Bosworth) move into her childhood home they are greeted with reluctance and torment. Amy encourages David to attempt to adapt to her childhood home in order to blend in- this blending in actually becomes their means of survival being that the citizens of Blackwater maintain a very hostile approach to any newcomers. It does not help that Amy's redneck ex boyfriend Charlie, maintains a deluded sense of ownership over Amy and essentially see's her as a piece of stolen property in consideration of David.This is the set up for the events of Straw Dog's and what starts out slowly, eventually escalates into an interesting examination of the human reaction when pushed to its limits. Director Lurie, truly explores the pressure that "bullying" can place on a man's mental stability- i could not help but think about the comparison between the story in "straw dogs" being a metaphor for the real life torment that is placed on people in High Schools and Work Places. We all know the resulting consequence when this sort of pressure is laid on, and the victim goes postal on his alleged "bullies". Without spoiling the ending you can imagine what is going to happen here.For this reason i think the film is well executed, of course until you figure out what is "actually" going on- you may feel like you are watching a bunch of Redneckers haze a couple of misfits. The "famous" rape sequence, is not in any way down-played in the remake and is climatic point in the film where the audience becomes aware that something dramatic is impending. I mentioned before that when i first viewed Straw Dogs, i was completely clueless about what the movie was going to be about- I was settling with a gory slasher horror in mind, and I thought that perhaps it would be reminiscent of "The Strangers" (2008). This misinformation led to the embarrassing occurrence of making it a "date-night" movie choice. You, try holding hands for the first time while a husband brutally slices and dices his wife's rapists. An astute film, to say the least, i'd recommend this movie to the right sort of person. The entertainment value is more or less dependent on your level of tolerance for plot build up, and character development. Viewing this film will probably lead to some interesting over coffee conversation- and that can't be a bad thing. I feel like many people will end up hating it for the same reason they hated the original, and thats okay too- i know in our culture there are certain things we still can't look past.*** On that final note; i'd consider the original a water-down version for those who are not enticed but do not wish to take on "this" version, and who doesn't enjoy seeing Dustin Hoffman get angrier and angrier (you won't like him when he's angry) I also want to defend that actually enjoying this movie does not make you a bad person but more so just smart enough to get the "bigger picture."- Review By Brandie Tschauner</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brings Authenticity to Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an action film of the genre in which city people are confronted with the horror of the rural culture. But here great pains are gone to to make the "rednecks" plausible, even in the right. Thus when David walks out of a sermon he has to have it pointed out to him he is being impolite. The other pivotal point is when he comes out from his perpetual pajama party with her to request the workmen start their job on the roof at an hour to conform with his private life. One conforms the other way when one's roof is being worked on. If necessary, one moves out while the work is going on. Charlie is quite justified in being contemptuous. (Of course, you also have to ask what kind of a fool would allow this particular roofer--with extreme cutaway sleeves and perfectly upholstered ass--to do the job in the first place?)Disrespect leads to violation. She is raped by Charlie and his buddy goes in for good measure. What took place is a total subversion of this family. This is a church going community, but then there is takes place beneath the surface.The film leaves no question she was in no way complicit in the rape. Yet she did have this question in her mind about how David stacks up against these men, what David would do if he had to? Well, she finds out and it is an all-out war from all angles.Much is made of legal rights when he is defending the (as we already know, guilty) man. It is an animation of liberal defense of the accused in general. A most remarkable performance is James Wood as an embodiment of the old school vindictive justice and practically everything else hard-headed. The younger men are cool. It is the elder who is the most brash, with his incongruous vacationers hat. He is full of violence. And yet at all times he stands for justice and family values--for his family. This film gives you a view of what takes place off scene in the child weddings of the Jerry Springer Show. It does not develop without a life-death struggle. This movie drives it home these people can be dangerous.Anyway, this film is head and shoulders above the typical mindless action film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exceptionally disturbing story, but a brilliantly made film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STRAW DOGS is a terrifying tale of man's inhumanity to man, terrifying in that it recreates some situations that remain active in certain parts of this country - of this world - and because it is difficult to stand as an observer to such unmitigated abuse. There are those who decry this updated version of the story and insist on comparing it to the 1971 Sam Peckinpah original, but putting aside the original film this piece of cinema is a finely constructed work that hopefully will leave the viewer disturbed, so grisly is its message. Director Rod Lurie adapted the screenplay from the original written by Sam Peckinpah and David Zelag Goodman who molded the screen version of Gordon Williams novel 'The Siege of Trencher's Farm'. The story has been updated and certain aspects of the characters have been changed, but this new version of Williams' novel is searingly real and brutally frightening.The title is significant and deserves definition: 'Straw dogs were used as ceremonial objects in ancient China. Chapter 5 of the Tao Te Ching begins with the lines "Heaven and Earth are heartless / treating creatures like straw dogs". Su Ch'e comments "Heaven and Earth are not partial. They do not kill living things out of cruelty or give them birth out of kindness. We do the same when we make straw dogs to use in sacrifices. We dress them up and put them on the altar, but not because we love them. And when the ceremony is over, we throw them into the street, but not because we hate them.'Screenwriter David Sumner (James Marsden) and his now-actress wife Amy (Kate Bosworth) are moving from Hollywood to Blackwater, Mississippi - Amy's hometown - to live in Amy's old homestead. Once there they meet the charming and handsomely macho Charlie (Alexander Skarsg?rd) who apparently had dated Amy before she left her home for an acting career in Hollywood. Charlie has an evil aura but offers to help David and Amy repair their new home that has been tattered by the recent hurricane. Charlie brings his crew - Norman (Rhys Coiro), Chris (Billy Lush) and Bic (Drew Powell) - to begin work on the Sumner home, but they are a motley crew, barging into the house for beer, and leaving early each day for hunting deer. David, who simply wants a peaceful place to write his script about the 1944 Stalingrad battle is concerned about their brazen behavior but Amy reassures him that is the Southern way: it is obvious that the crew is eyeing the scantily dressed Amy.Visits in town include time in the bar where David encounters the crazy, lethally behaving Coach Tom Heddon (James Woods) interacting with not only his crew but also with abusive behavior to the mentally challenged Jeremy Niles (Domenic Purcell) who is protected by his brother Daniel (Walton Goggins) in the Coach's accusations that Jeremy is too close to the Coach's 15 year old daughter Janice (Willa Holland). David takes it all in and realizes that all is not as it seems. David and Amy try to fit in to the town - attending parties and football games - but when Charlie and crew invite David to go hunting with them and David reluctantly accepts, the gruesome part of the film begins: David kills a deer against his better judgment only to discover that Charlie and crew have deserted him in the woods and are back at David's home attacking Amy. The action then becomes one of protracted violence as the crew and Coach attack the Sumner home (David and Amy are protecting Jeremy from the wrath of the Coach) and the normally peace living David must become a warrior against evil.Though the story is repugnantly similar to some life situations (and this viewer had difficulty simply watching portions of the film), the acting by everyone in the film is unusually fine. James Marsden, Kate Bosworth, and the brilliant rising star Alexander Skarsg?rd make their characters totally credible and Rod Lurie's direction is keenly sensitive to every innuendo in the film. This is one of the strongest works on the screen and deserves a much larger audience. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dire remake of the overrated 1971 original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it horror? I don't know, but it was surely horrific and painful to watch. Despite its high IMDb rating, I wasn't a fan of the 1971 original, but I had eager hopes for the remake.Sadly the 2011 version is nothing special either. A dumb story. And dumb characters. Both in 1971 and in 2011. I try to avoid spoilers but suffice to say you'll kick yourself at the idiotic things that go on in this movie. The foolish things people say and do.The point? I couldn't tell you.The actors try but the truth is there isn't much of a story to tell. It's bland, it's boring. It's awful and I couldn't care less. The result is a poor movie which leaves James Woods looking as if he has nothing much to do except shout. The lead actor James Marsden is miscast, and his wife in the film just seems pointless, but without her there would be no story. She's pivotal but she's also irrelevant. That's the stupidity of this film.The resulting violence is bland and unexciting. A guy uses a nail gun and boiling water in anger and we're supposed to cheer him on, but I was left thinking this sucks.I couldn't wait for the ending. Just 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who toughs out this remake to the end will be able to piece together the initial pitch. BDM#1: "Let's remake STRAW DOGS." BDM#2: "Great idea--how can we improve on the original?" BDM#1. "That's a toughie--no, wait, I've got it!--OF MICE AND MEN meets STRAW DOGS!" BDM#2: Super! Both originals even had animals; they'll go together like yin and nin." BDM#1: "Yang." BDM#2: "Huh?" BDM#1: "That's yin and YANG." BDM#2: "Whatever."If I had been at this meeting (which would have cost a minimum of $50, times being what they are), I would have interposed "Yin or Yang, that idea basically sucks. Any time the camera's on "Lenny," it will detract from the main story. If one of the BDMs countered "that's okay, we'll make the 'Lenny' character blind, so he won't know the camera's on him," I'd have punched him out then and there. If, on the other hand, they asked "How would you change it, then?" I'd respond "If we're making BOTH spouses Hollywood types in this 2011 version, let's make David Summer GAY. From the days of Rock Hudson through Anne Heche nowadays, Tinsel-towners often marry with no regard to sexual orientation. If it came out that David had a furtive but definite gay orientation shortly after his arrival in the boondocks, and his wife Amy STILL turned down the advances of her sexist high school sweetie Charlie, stuff would start hitting the fan much faster, as Charlie would think Amy was REALLY going to waste with David. There would be no need to clutter the original story with not-only-plagiarized, but-also-distracting sub-plots. For only $1,000 more, I could have had a first draft completed of a worthy 21st Century STRAW DOGS remake in a week or so. But given the finished product on display in theaters this month, it seems likely the producers obtained the services of their loser screenwriters for far LESS than even my minimum rate. Times might be pretty tough, but I will NOT write a movie script for the price of a bag of Cheetos!</fullReview>

Jame's woods was outstanding,when doesn't he play a good character. I say,if the movie pisses you off,scares you or gets your adrenaline going,it was worth it. I liked it. I didn't think any of it was boring to be honest. I like the state where it took place. places like black water and other states down south are known to have these kind of problems arise from small towns. the town was kind of empty,small population where word gets out easy and everyone seems to be in on everything.

		<shortDescription>Straw Dogs: An Entertaining and Frightening Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah's 1971 rape-revenge classic "Straw Dogs" was, and still is, pretty damn controversial, due to its pessimism, violence, the performance of Dustin Hoffman, and a shocking rape scene. What in the world makes somebody think they can remake it? Well, someone has done it, and made it work! Rod Lurie's 2011 remake of "Straw Dogs" gets it right.Screenwriter David Sumner(played by Dustin Hoffman in the original) and his actress wife, Amy, take a break from the big city life and head to Amy's old town of Blackwater. Her presence is welcomed by most, especially Charlie, her ex-boyfriend. But as soon as David hires Charlie and his crew to fix their roof at the house, things go wrong. Charlie blasts his radio at the crack of dawn, creating a nuisance for David and Amy. Some of the men walk into the house and grab beers without permission. And then Amy catches them sexually eye-balling her. David fires Charlie and his crew, but things only get worse. In order to keep his house and his family safe, David must fight back.2011's "Straw Dogs" is an example of what a remake is supposed to do. Like Cronenberg's "The Fly," Craig Gillespie's "Fright Night," and Matt Reeves' "Let Me In," Rod Lurie's version of Peckinpah's film sticks very closely to the original while still doing some new things with it.The first difference between 1971's "Straw Dogs" and the remake is the setting. Taking it from a British village to a house on the coast of Mississippi, Lurie brings more eeriness to the film than the original did. There are no inbred monsters, like in "Deliverance," but there certainly are creepy locals who we are never quite sure of who they really are inside.Another difference is tone. While Peckinpah's film rubbed your face in its graphic content, Lurie allows the audience to experience a more humanistic and suspenseful approach. He creates a wonderful build-up of tension until things finally take you on the roller-coaster ride you are expecting. There isn't much shown in the rape scene, which makes it all the more effective (the remake trades disquieting ambivalence for a restrained and terrifying assault on the senses).Also, the film doesn't celebrate violence, which is the first thing negative reviewers have disliked it for. Like the original, it's a thinking man's thriller. It's not just a "What would you do?" situation. It's more about the things we don't know about each other, the bad side of ourselves that we never show. Amy thinks David is a coward, but he is really pacifistic. He knows there are other ways to solve problems. But when his home is invaded, his anti-violent self is tested, and is forced into violence. Overall, Lurie carries Peckinpah's psychological message throughout the remake.The casting is fantastic! Many will go to see "Straw Dogs" because of "True Blood" heartthrob Alexander Skarsgard's performance as Charlie. With a perfect southern accent, Skarsgard is menacing without going over the top. Like Colin Farrell's performance in the remake of "Fright Night," just a stare can really frighten somebody. James Marsden is not Dustin Hoffman, but he is able to step into some pretty big shoes and surprise people, especially after such comedic films as "Enchanted" and "27 Dresses." I believe in his performance. Kate Bosworth is also great as Amy. More of a victimized survivalist than a whiny damsel in distress(Susan George's characterization in the original was good, but far from greatness), Bosworth understands Amy and hits all the right buttons. Another awesome performance is given by James Woods as the football coach with a seriously bad attitude, drunk or sober.Lurie provides some very good symbolism in his version of the movie, as well. Using the town's fascination with football as a metaphor for damage to a human being (physically and emotionally) adds unsettling detail to some scenes. And the decision to change David from a troubled mathematician to a screenwriter writing a film about Stalingrad(a metaphor for the film's psychological warfare) is a risk worth taking.Overall, as much as I loved the remake of Wes Craven's "Last House on the Left," I think those expecting a horror movie with intense gore and nude blonds will be disappointed by "Straw Dogs." Those who want an entertaining, full-throttle psychological thriller with good suspense, the right amount of violence, and nifty performances from the cast will find it to be an exceptional remake that stands out among other failures (ahem, Gus Van Sant's duplicate of "Psycho"). I really enjoyed it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>* Spoilers - Don't let them in! - Spoilers *</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And in the case of David: when they invite you "in," don't go. One of the themes of this film was xenophobia. If you're not like us, you can't be one of us. Symbolic of that is the local treatment of the man who is retarded. "We take care of our own." Well, no, you don't. Charlie didn't "take care" of Amy in the past, and he's not going to do so in the present or the future. The coach couldn't take care of his daughter; she would get out from under his watchful eye.Amy and David's "crime" was to "come in" in the first place. They didn't "fit in." To show how they didn't belong, the workman walked into their house, went further in by opening their refrigerator and taking what he wanted. Their bedroom was violated; another interior space invaded: the closet. Further violation was the killing and hanging of the cat and placed in that interior space. The irony part was, "you can't leave, either," when David left the church service- he placed himself further out. He rejects their invitation to come into the circle of men in the booth in the bar because they had almost killed him on the road into town, and he didn't trust them. His rejection pushed him further out, but if he had joined them, he still would have been out. The time he did go with them, hunting in the forest, again, he didn't belong there. Charlie and his friend went into David and Amy's home, and into Amy herself. When they both tried to go "back into" society, attending the football game, Amy's flashbacks prevented her from ever being in with them ? and by not telling David, she didn't let him in, either. Of course, the home invasion was the last "straw." And David kept them all out in the end.The Peckinpaugh Straw Dogs was very layered and complicated and he used five editors to make it come together. Hoffman's David was a sociopath who only did things to please himself. Marsden's David was an alien in a foreign land, who made mistakes of dress and language as well as behavior. He had a breezy, almost dismissive way about him; he treated the locals: cheerfully and offhand. He covered his anger with a smile and falsely friendliness. They almost had him killed on the road, and he bought them $100 worth of beer, rubbing it subtly in their faces that he could do it, he could afford it. He tried to kill them with kindness. James Marsden, please do not participate in another remake. No one will treat you fairly. People will compare you to an actor who played your part two years before you were born. I think the acting was superb; some were miscast, and one went over the top, but that's his style (James Woods). Contrary to many others' opinion, I thought James Marsden was the standout. My favorite scene is when he played the Cajun song on the phonograph and stood cleaning his glasses on his shirt. He wasn't going to let them in, either, and if they did get in, they'd suffer for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good old fashioned nasty horror film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'STRAW DOGS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)This remake is just a good old fashioned nasty horror film, complete with brutal violence and stereotypes galore (including exploiting the handicap, 'Of Mice And Men' style). Rod Lurie wrote and directed this updated version of the popular 1971 Sam Peckinpah classic (which was in turn based on the novel 'The Siege of Trencher's Farm' by Gordon M. Williams). I never saw the original (it's one of those rare classics I never got around to seeing but hopefully will soon) but I've heard this new adaptation is very faithful to it. This one stars James Marsden and Kate Bosworth in the roles made famous by Dustin Hoffman and Susan George. It also stars Alexander Skarsgard (of 'TRUE BLOOD' fame), Dominic Purcell (of 'PRISON BREAK' fame) and James Woods. There's much not to like or enjoy in this disturbing psychological thriller but there's also a lot to find interesting and involving and the filmmakers did a pretty good job bringing those themes to the screen. Marsden and Bosworth play David and Amy Sumner, a couple who move back to Amy's hometown in Mississippi in order to fix up a house her family owns while David, an L.A. screenwriter, works on his writing. They hire a group of local 'rednecks', led by Amy's ex-boyfriend Charlie (Skarsgard), to fix up the barn next to their house. Cultures clash right off the bat as Charlie takes an immediate disliking to David and David in turn feels threatened by Charlie. Charlie and his boys harass David and Amy to increasingly escalating levels while David fails to react until things, of course, eventually reach a breaking point. The setting was changed from England to the South for this remake and David's profession was altered from a mathematician to a writer. Other than that I've heard the film pretty much follows the same course as the original. My interest in seeing the original film is definitely peaked now. I am a fan of Peckinpah and Hoffman and love horror films. I have found that the horror films released in the 70's were some of the most disturbing and raw of any decade. I've also noticed that several dealt with very disturbing subject matter, like rape (as well as exploiting the handicap), in very controversial ways (like the original 'STRAW DOGS', 'I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE' and 'LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT'). The original film received a lot of negative criticism, at the time, for it's rape scene but I've heard the new film handles the material in a much better way (I'd have to see the original film of course to state my own opinion on the subject). The new film does depict the rape scene in a pretty unbelievable way in my opinion (at least the events that follow it). I know the film is supposedly really faithful to the original but the material doesn't quite stand the test of time. What was realistic forty years ago wouldn't quite pan out the same way now. This new film was criticized for glorifying violence (like the original) though and I don't really think it does. At no time during the film did I think the violence was 'cool' or enjoyable. It was pretty disturbing in my opinion and really hard to sit through (like violence done realistically should be). Film, like anything, is completely subjective and all about the interpretation of the viewer. I don't think the filmmakers intended to glorify violence though and I actually think they did a good job with the action scenes. They also did a good job of developing the David character and exploring his transformation from wuss to 'man of action' in a very relatable way. As far as horror movies go I think the whole movie was generally well made as well. The directing was interesting, the score haunting and very fitting and the acting was at least decent (with Marsden being the stand out in my opinion). The film is nasty and ugly and above all disturbing but that's what good horror should be. It shouldn't be a fun time at the movies (unless it's camp) and I don't think this film was. It works on it's own level.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mlB8eyvpck</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So my first choices to watch at the cinema were Contagion, Drive, or even Don't Be Afraid of the Dark... But I gave in to see this because of my friends. I can say that the film was entertaining and it did keep me invested. It did have some dumb scenes, and the direction at times bothered me. My biggest complaint is definitely the 3rd act. I just found it preposterous to the point of it not being thrilling at all anymore. By the middle of the climax I was actually bored. Definitely not a good ending and the way the violence was portrayed really put me off. It just seemed... off. That aside the firs two acts are actually pretty good and because of that i do recommend it. It reminded me of the remake of The Last House on the Left, although that one was more brutal and disturbing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lurie has replaced Oliver Stone as our most important creator of socially-conscious films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To call Rod Lurie's Straw Dogs a remake of the famed (infamous!) 1971 Sam Peckinpah controversial classic of that name is to do the new film a great injustice as well as to under-rate what has been accomplished here. Lurie's narrative follows the same basic storyline, originally presented in the pulp novel The Siege at Trencher's Farm, about an upscale couple besieged in their rural home by rednecks. All similarity ends there, particularly as to the anti-feminist bias in Peckinpah's movie, most of all as the much discussed rape scene is concerned. Without wanting to give too much away, Lurie has actually managed what might have seemed the impossible by transforming this into a pro-feminist fable, and the manner in which he has done so will be of interest to serious cinema buffs, even as the film will play beautifully to the mass audience that only wants to see an excellent action film, perfectly mounted. Lurie draws the best possible performances out of actors who have been appealing, if nothing more, before this. Here's a film that demands to be seen at the moment yet will also prove of long-lasting value. For anyone who has not noticed before, Lurie has replaced Oliver Stone as our most important creator of socially-conscious films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gutwrenching movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gut wrenching movie! Straw Dogs is intense to watch! The movie is a social drama about the human animal. The show is the study of people who bully and use conflict to gain their way! I see to much of this at work, and they show this side of people in this movie to well. The story pits the intellectual who tries to reason too much vs the burnt out football hero who peaked at age 17! Mr all American football star is jealous of the guy who got his gal, has more money, and a better car. The conflict of the two opposites is inevitable! The second group dynamic is Mr football hero, has the social and physically skills to lead his little group of guys. The number two in the group is the tough psycho who can scare the others, but can never lead for he lacks the social skills. One of the other guys is the passive one who just goes along with the group , while the other guy is the big mouth clown/tough guy of the town who just hangs on with the group. The town has it bullies and the top bully is the old ex coach with pushes everyone around. When the wolf pack lead on by the coach through a series of events have their final conflict with Mr push over. Coach's old students think they can hit the soft target again but instead push Mr intellectual to far and end up getting bitter retribution. The moral of the story is being too extreme is not good. This movie is a bit hard to watch. I give it 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not great but beautiful. A story of a time. Delicate hush. Nostalgic and dramatic. A screenwriter as axis. A sinner as pray. And a young lady for who an error was damnation. The facts may be ingredients for games, moral lessons or love stories. "Straw Dogs" is one of that stories.Seductive and childish, beautiful and strange, about price of freedom and food for emotions, romance and thriller, with a spectacular cast, it is precise definition of good and evil and gift for any form of hope. James Marsden is Prometheus of action. Kate Bosworth- the spice. The events are only shadows and the bad boys - cartoons.Not a great movie but a delicious trip to a lost age. Not a historical page but Schindler's list for teenagers. Amovie about a reality and some new importance ? satisfaction, exaltation ? they hardly knew how to call it.A game.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This "Straw Dogs" Is A Breed Apart!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imitation, Mohandas Gandhi said, is the sincerest form of flattery. The ghost of Sam Peckinpah would be flattered with the new tricks that "Deterrence" writer &amp; director Rod Lurie has taught the old "Straw Dogs" for contemporary audiences. Although it isn't a carbon copy of the volatile 1971 melodrama, the new "Straw Dogs" replicates the original in many respects. Mind you, nobody could set aside Peckinpah's gritty epic which still sparks controversy for its misogynistic sexual politics. Nevertheless, Lurie's politically-correct remake polishes off the rough edges and makes everything objectionable palatable. In the process, he sacrifices some of the ambiguity that made Peckinpah's messy masterpiece a more memorable movie. Of course, the new "Straw Dogs" lacks the rabid ferocity of the Peckinpah picture. Nevertheless, the original and the remake both wound up with an R-rating for violence, sexuality, nudity, and profane language. Like the original, the remake features a vicious rape sequence, but with virtually no nudity. What may sicken some otherwise stout hearted spectators more than the man versus man violence is the mysterious strangulation death of a white cat. Yes, the original had a similar scene where our protagonists found their pet cat dangling from their closet light cord. Otherwise, the new "Straw Dogs" boasts a gripping story, interesting characters, and some surprises that ought to keep audiences guessing throughout this unsavory saga. Along the way, Lurie has made some changes. First, he shifted the setting to rural Mississippi and takes advantage of the tradition of Southern violence. One of the few problems with the original was the lack of familiarity with the English setting. Hollywood has not made as many movies about sadistic English vigilantes as it has about xenophobic Mississippi racists. Second, the hero is a film scenarist rather than an astrophysicist. Third, the mentally handicapped supporting character is not as unsavory. Fourth, David and Amy have a stronger marriage. At the end of Peckinpah's "Straw Dogs," the husband left the wife because she had betrayed him during the home invasion. Hollywood scenarist David Sumner (James Marsden of "X-Men") and his gorgeous young wife Amy (Kate Bosworth of "Blue Crush") return to her hometown of Blackwater, Mississippi. Sumner has to pen a screenplay about the landmark twentieth century battle of Stalingrad, one of the turning points of World War II, and he wants to write it in the bucolic backwoods of the south. David and Amy met during a television series that he wrote for her, but the show has been canceled. Unfortunately, the Harvard educated David isn't prepared for the reception that he encounters. Essentially, David is a fish-out-of-water. Not only does he discover that his debit card is worthless, but he doesn't share the same relish for fried pickles as a delicacy that Amy's friends do. One of Amy's friends, Charlie (Alexander Skarsg?rd of HBO's "True Blood"), wants to resume their former relationship as lovers. She was a cheerleader, and Charlie was the star football quarterback under the guidance of old school coach Tom Heddon (James Woods of "Ghosts of Mississippi") who made his players grovel. When he meets Charlie at the local watering hole, David makes the mistake of hiring Charlie and his redneck hillbilly pals to rebuild a garage on Amy's property that Hurricane Katrina ravaged. Charlie and his pals start work too early for David and things deteriorate from that point. One of Charlie's crew, Bic (Drew Powell of "The Marine"), ambles into Amy's house without an invitation and helps himself to a beer from the fridge. Amy thinks coming home is a vacation, but David is serious about his work. Amy aggravates matters when she jogs around the property without a bra. She reminds David that she dresses for him and he reminds her that he knows what she looks like without a bra. Meantime, Charlie interprets Amy's behavior as solicitation, and he invites David?who knows little about firearms?to join them for a hunt. Charlie slips away and rapes Amy while David is occupied in the woods. Later, one of the town citizens, a mentally challenged man, Henry Niles (Dominic Purcell of "Prison Break"), accidentally kills Tom Heddon's daughter. All chaos breaks loose. David shields Niles from a vengeful Heddon who demands that David relinquish him. Heddon persuades Charlie and his friends to help him storm the farmhouse and take Niles. Suffice to say; what ensues isn't a picnic for anybody. Lurie has done a splendid job of fleshing out the heroes and villains in a different locale. He lets the antagonism smolder, and then he orchestrates a savage finale where our hero takes no prisoners. One weapon that our hero wields was not available to the English yahoos who assaulted Dustin Hoffman. James Marsden wields an automatic nail gun with devastating results. Similarly, the English yahoos didn't smash through the farmhouse with a pick-up truck. Comparatively, the Englishmen were armed with only one shotgun rather than an arsenal of high-powered hunting rifles. Marsden plays a different kind of nerd from the Hoffman hero. Lurie rewrote the Kate Bosworth damsel-in-distress role so that she possesses more maturity than Susan George's petulant Lolita-like wife. Unlike the Hoffman-George marriage that strained credibility, everything about the Marsden-Bosworth union seems believable. As a couple, their characters seem far more compatible. We are told more about their back story than Peckinpah revealed about the Hoffman-George marriage. Meantime, Alexander Skarsg?rd and James Woods emerge as stronger villains than Peter Vaughn and Del Henney in the original. While the film relied on Gordon Williams' novel "The Siege of Trencher's Farm" for its source material, Lurie derived most of his inspiration from the David Zelag Goodman &amp; Sam Peckinpah script. Lurie lifted several lines straight from the original, though he left out Hoffman's memorable line: "I will not allow violence against this house!" For the record, although the action occurs in Mississippi, the filmmakers lensed the story in Shreveport, Louisiana. Nevertheless, as remakes rate, "Straw Dogs" qualifies as a breed apart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More proof that city and country do not mix?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what it is about film trying to steer city people from the country, but they sure do try hard in film with Deliverance to Straw Dogs. I have to admit, I've never seen the original Straw Dogs, and I am ashamed as I've heard it's a good movie. Just never had the opportunity to see it, but hopefully that'll change soon since it looks really interesting. So I can't compare the original with the remake just yet. But I think that's pretty fair to judge on since I heard that this is a bit different from the original with the setting. This time it takes place in the country. I visited Idaho a few years ago to meet my ex's family, I'm a born and raised Chi-Town girl, very city, but when I went to Idaho, I thought it wouldn't be a big deal. Apparently I was very wrong, I felt like I was in a different country, people are different and it's a bit scary the way they look at you as I'm sure my ex felt with the city being a little more isolated being in a busy place where people don't notice each other. Whole point to this story is that it's amazing how scary it can be being from a city or from the south and not knowing your surroundings is scary enough as it is, Straw Dogs explores that terror to the enth degree.David Sumner and his wife and TV actress Amy, move to Mississippi, where Amy grew up, to rebuild Amy's recently deceased father's house, and so that David can finish a script. David meets Amy's ex-boyfriend Charlie and his friends, whom he hires to fix the house's roof, which was recently destroyed by a tornado. Charlie and his friends begin taunting David, who is initially condescending to their customs. The taunting escalates into harassment as they make crude remarks towards Amy and play loud music to annoy David and prevent him from working on his screenplay. The taunting gets more and more threatening leading to physical violence. The boys taunt that David is not a man, but they may want to be careful on pushing him too far.Today with horror films, we have torture porn such as Saw and Hostel. I may have not seen the original Straw Dogs, but I'm sure that the deaths were not as dramatic as they were in this film. I felt that the extreme violence really took away from the film. First off I'm guessing that I'm supposed to take this movie realistically, so why would this smart guy murder the southerners so viciously? Granted he has a witness that could back him up and say it was self defense, but I'm pretty sure the police are going to look at a bear trap over the head as a bit extreme. I know that the audience wants the entertainment, but I think this was a bit too over the top with the gore factor.But the film does have some perks, the whole setting is horrific. Being isolated from the city is scary where you're used to having everything at your fingertips, but not knowing where to go for help is horrible. Alexander Skarsg?rd takes a break from True Blood, somewhat with the over southerness, and makes a great creeper. James Marsden does an alright job as David, though he plays him very blandly so honestly I really didn't care much for his character. Kate Bosworth did alright, but again her character is kinda on the mean girl level, so I don't really care for her as well. James Woods, what can I say? He's James Woods, he's always a pleasure to watch on the screen and does give his best to the character. Is the film scary? In some ways yes with it's atmosphere and fear of the unknown, not knowing what these crazy boys would do next could be a bit creepy. But also since most of the characters were a bit dull, it took away any sympathy you could have for them. The film is certainly flawed but I don't think it was terrible, they gave a good effort for the most part. I would just say that this is a rental and now I'm going to get my butt in gear and get the original Straw Dogs.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, this movie is for sissy-boys and girls ONLY, girl who think vengeance is great, love happens the cute way &amp; US culture is something precious only to be thrown out at the end in 2 minutes. Let me get that in details, without the Straw Dogs image this movie would be the biggest flop ever, thus going into the famous ManU star the movie actually gets attention. The outdoor scenes are really bad, staged of course and the camera focuses on the wrong end so as for directing I'm going to give it the worst mark for sure. Then the love conflict are dating back from the 1980s British dating, getting annoyed at another neighbor so immature shows the screenplay was writted on a a beercoaster with ripped off corners. Every teen girl is going to love this but everybody else will be feeling cheated at the story. Then the culture has always been a talked about issue, arranged marriages, inner culture marriages etc...nothing new and then as a stupid twist in the story the whole issue is forgotten for the sake of a happy ending...stupid stupid stupid...'nuff said!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Straw Dogs" a psychological thriller directed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night, I screened "Straw Dogs" a psychological thriller directed by Rod Lurie. This movie is a remake of the 1971 original version directed by Sam Peckinpah who was known for his explicit description of action and violence in his films.Based on the novel "The Siege of Trencher's Farm" by Gordon Williams. Rod Lurie shows his version with a few variations from the script keeping the plot very close to the original. The director touches controversial topics stirring your interest and emotions. This is a very engaging, character driven film with a lot of disturbing moments. It starts with slow opening scenes and gradually builds suspense and raises intensity towards the end delivering an explosive ending.I have mixed feelings about this movie, but I honestly think that it's better than the original version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original: Masterpiece The Remake: Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Straw Dogs (2011) *** (out of 4) Remake of the 1971 Sam Peckinpah film has a husband and wife (James Marsden, Kate Bosworth) moving back to her hometown where they're not completely welcomed. The husband does what he can not to cause any trouble or go out of his way to stop things until being pushed too far.I will start off by admitting that I think the original movie is one of the greatest of its kind and a truly well-made and at times frightening film. This 2011 version is an extremely well-acted and well-made movie but it never quite reaches the level of the original. Whereas everything here is good to very good, everything in the original movie was excellent to exceptional. With all of that said, I'll quit comparing the two because I really do mean that everything in the original is better but that certainly doesn't mean this one here isn't a good movie. As I said, this is an extremely well-made movie that features some pretty good style and director Rod Lurie certainly keeps everything moving. I thought the director did a very good job at building up this "Southern comfort" feel and he certainly didn't make any of the locals morons or some sort of cheap stereotype that you usually find in these kind of movies. The director was also quite smart in knowing how to slowly build up suspense. There's certainly several moments where the director manages to build it up and this is especially true towards the end once the home protection thing starts.I'm not overly familiar with Marsden but he comes off extremely well here. The husband's profession has been changed to a screenwriter and I think this change fits the actor just right because he certainly comes off well playing the smart guy and I enjoyed the laid back approach and style. He's completely believable in the scenes where he's being pushed around but when the tables turn you believe him as well. Bosworth is also very good in her role and I especially liked the scenes where she confronts her husband for not standing up to the locals. Alexander Skarsgard is really effective as the leader of the pack and the wife's ex-boyfriend. We also get James Wood in a terrific performance playing a local drunk whose daughter is constantly flirting with the Niles character. Wood was born to play this type of role and he certainly does it well. If you're unfamiliar with the original movie and you're willing to put up with the slow pace then I think you'll find this to be a great movie. If you've seen the original then the one big burden here is that it's pretty much a scene for scene remake. Sadly, outside of a few minor things, everything happens here just like in the original so if you're already familiar with the story then there's nothing here that you won't see coming. I must admit that I was a little disappointed by the filmmakers not trying to do something on their own to keep those familiar with the original off guard while watching. Still, there's no question that this is a well-made movie and one that's worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>STRAW DOGS Kicks Ass!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught a screening of STRAW DOGS last week. Rod Lurie directed a tight film that kicks major ass."Firstly, Lurie has assembled a dynamite cast: James Marsden, Kate Bosworth, Alexander Skarsgard, James Woods and even Walton Goggins (who is absolute nitro-glycerin in FX's Justified) has a small role. The fact that Lurie was able to attract this cast speaks volumes for his reputation. Is this an award-worthy film? No. Is it a good time at the movies? Hell yes! "A Hollywood screenwriter (Marsden) and his wife (Bosworth) are moving into a home in his wife's small rural hometown so he can write his new script, Stalingrad, in peace and tranquility. She had a small role in a TV show he once wrote but we get the impression she's washed up now (she's one of the many Straw Dogs in the film, a.k.a people who peaked to early but are now hollow and easily knocked-around and broken). "Marsden is fantastic in the film. In fact, he's never been better. He exhudes kindness and decency. He plays the soft city boy with a heart. "The happy couple settle into their countryside mansion in the middle of a very isolated forest. In town, they run into Bosworth's old flame (Skarsgard). Skarsgard is everything that Marsden is not -- tall, rugged, manly and dangerous. The quintessential bad boy that all girls are attracted to in their teens but eventually grow out of... or do they? "There are two themes running through the film. The first (and I'm not too sure I agree with this) is that a man can only be a man if he resorts to violence in order to defend his wife. Lurie also straddles a dangerous line in the film by presenting us with a wife who is a provoker. "Marsden kindly hires Bosworth's ex-boyfriend to fix the roof of the barn... and then Bosworth proceeds to jog around the forest in skimpy clothing (no bra, barefoot). She then complains to her husband that her former flame and his crew of roofers are eye-raping her. Marsden ever so kindly (and he could've been an ass but wasn't) suggests that maybe she should consider wearing a bra next time. Bosworth is obfuscated by this suggestion. So what does she do? Goes upstairs, opens the bedroom window and proceeds to strip in front of Skarsgard and his crew. It's an ambivalent, tough scene that says a lot about feminism, power struggles in couples and highlights that actresses (in real life and on film) are a loopy bunch. Bosworth shines in this film. Playing both beautiful, sexy and aloof. A tough combo but she pulls it off admirably. "Therein lies the second theme of the film: Do women want the stable, dependable good-guy or do they have deep subconscious yearnings for a bad boy? "So far the film is great. Fun set-up and it's fun to see Marsden create his writing workspace - - chalkboard with scenes and notes in a lovely dream office, etc. Marsden is once again great in the film, despite his thankless role -- the pussy-fied husband who must grow a brass- coated set of testicles by the end of the film so his Southern Wife can finally respect him... and he eventually does, in a realistic, believable fashion to boot. I won't go into spoiler territory. There are a few nifty surprises and great performances all around. "The siege-like ending is gangbusters. Violent and very un-Lurie-like. Marsden rises to the occasion and all the plot strands come together. Woods is great as a drunken high-school football coach who doesn't want his teenage daughter flirting with the local developmentally delayed man (Dominic Purcell). This is a remake of the Pekinpah classic that is famous for it's ambivalent rape scene. Therefore, I'm not spoiling anything by saying that -- "Yes, there is a fairly graphic rape. Yes, Bosworth is ambivalent in the scene. Does she fight off her rapist as hard as she could during the rape? Nope. Does she kinda like it? Sure seemed like that to me (which will surely infuriate the feminists out there). There's also an incredibly satisfying final kill that involves a bear- trap."Straw Dogs is a good, solid movie with great, crowd-cheering moments."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Exceptional Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STRAW DOGS is an outstanding movie! It's a character-driven thriller that builds to an explosive climax. The performances are well-directed across the board, and Alexander Skarsgard and James Woods are especially effective in their roles.The setup is simple: a California couple relocates to the wife's hometown in the deep South and they become steadily antagonized by a local group of men. Where this film really excels is in its execution. The opening scene really sets the tone for the film. You can tell immediately that this movie is going to be about survival. Rod Lurie does a great job introducing the major characters in a sharply delineated fashion and then layering the characterization so the conflict, both internal and external, unfolds at a deliberate pace. It grounds the story in character and makes the third act very satisfying, exciting and earned.The entire film is very well made. Strong script, precise direction, a lot of symbolism and thematic resonance. It's well worth a trip to the theater to see it. It's engaging, sometimes funny, often intense, and excellent performance-driven filmmaking.</fullReview>
