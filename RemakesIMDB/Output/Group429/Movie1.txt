		<shortDescription>Movies shouldn't entertain, they should scar.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think pretty much all of the people posting comments on this film have totally missed the point of the film. One reviewer sees the movie as sexist against women, others hate that plot points aren't wrapped up or it doesn't make sense that Amy enjoys the rape. A lot of people just don't seem to get this film. This film is not about entertainment. It's not interested in impressing you with artistic flare, and it doesn't care about wrapping sh-t up in a neat little package so you walk away with all the answers. People who complain about that kind of stuff might as well go and watch a Julia Roberts movie. This is Sam Peckinpah working out his demons, this is him breaking into your safe haven, slashing your face open. I personally have never been more disturbed or hurt by a film in my life, and because of this, I don't walk away in denial of its greatness. I'm able to say, "wow! That movie totally tapped in to these dormant emotions and feelings I've always had but either didn't realize or wasn't willing to admit to myself. Examples of Peckinpahs crushing insights are the entire female/male dynamic, the hurt we cause each other intentionally and unintentionally, the sickness of it all. This film hurt me so bad that I couldn't talk to my wife for about a week after. (Incidentally, the same thing happened in reverse when she watched Fight Club, which is really the perfect companion to this film.) This movie forces you to think, to face the ugliness of the world. It presents you with sh-t you don't want to face, feelings that you have buried in your subconscious so you will not have to deal with them. That is why I think so many people don't like this movie, because it has scarred them so badly that they can't even admit it hit a nerve, and thus dismiss it as "stupid, or retarded" I don't think I'll ever be able to watch this movie again, it was just too raw, too powerful, too hurtful. But I learned a lot about myself in the process, and was totally absorbed and thoughtful for a long time afterwards." I don't know how much movies should entertain. To me I'm always interested in movies that scar. The thing I love about JAWS is the fact that I've never gone swimming in the ocean again." -David Fincher</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfairly kicked around by its critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably one of the most offensive masterpieces ever made. There's no reason to argue with many of the objections against it, but the main criticism- that Hoffman is battling his Amy's rapists for sexual mastery of her- is unfair. Many of the film's critics don't seem to realize that what the audience learns about events is completely different from what Hoffman knows. He never learns that the villagers raped his wife; and he's never completely sure that Nyles, the villager he's defending, *didn't* rape a girl. He never realizes that the villagers are hypocrites for raping his wife and then hunting down Nyles as a "perverted animal." And he never realizes that his wife wants to throw Nyles out not because she's an immoral coward, but because, after being raped once, she doesn't want to defend an accused rapist. Amy is not the object of his fight, which is why he asks her if she wants to leave in the middle of it. She's as irrelevant to him as the villager he's defending. Hoffman's only concern is his house, which Peckinpah views as the symbol of his manhood. They're both under construction and assault by the villagers. When Hoffman has finally defended his house, he decides that he doesn't really know his way home; his manhood is worthless to him. It's difficult to understand why the film's critics view its climax as an expression of Peckinpah's supposed belief that women must be seized through violence. Hoffman never even knows that Amy's part of the contest, and even though we do, we're left with the impression he's lost her, not earned her, because of his battle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could they show this in 1971?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So you think movies are violent today, huh? Think again. Sam Peckinpah's highly charged, extremely intense, brutally violent 1971 pic is an underrated masterpiece, in my opinion, that redefined cinema violence forever (as if "The Wild Bunch" wasn't enough). It is one of the best directed, most fluidly edited pictures that I've seen in recent years. Today's films don't even come close.Allegedly banned in the U.K. to this very day, "Straw Dogs" came to me out of nowhere. I had heard good things about it, but never really caught onto it, until one day when I was at a video store browsing around for no apparent reason. I had absolutely no money and wasn't planning to buy anything when all of the sudden, I saw it . . .WIDESCREEN - UNCENSORED,RESTORED - COLLECTOR'S EDITIONI had never even seen the movie and I wanted to buy it! I mean, hey, it WAS the last one left.So I took a huge risk, got a loan from my mother, used all the two-dollar bills I had been saving to pay her back, and bought it right out. And then, I viewed it later on that night, praying I hadn't wasted my time. AND: I was floored. The film literally knocked me out, kept me peeled to the screen at every instant, left me disturbed for days to come. I mean, let me tell you, go out and rent this, buy this, anything, just see it! Although it is moderately paced, the film remains intense the whole way, and takes an unexpected turn into extreme violence towards the legendary ending, a showdown worthy of multiple viewings (watch "Fear" to see an amateur retread).So it goes like this: Hoffman plays a wimpy mathematician who flees with his wife George to the peaceful countryside (to get away from violence!), only to be ravaged by the locals who just wanna start trouble. It is the ultimate test of manhood, showing us (in a somewhat biased manner) that it takes aggression to get what you want and keep what you have. You'll be amazed at Hoffman's "transformation" (we all know deep down that EVERYONE'S got it in them somewhere), but it makes you think, especially when Hoffman has to defend his home from several large armed men WITHOUT USING ANY WEAPONS, only his brains and some household appliances.I'm surprised that this is such a forgotten film. There aren't enough people who can actually claim to have seen this picture or even know what it's about. I find that hard to ingest, being that it was one of the most controversial films of its day. But it IS very brutal, especially the once trimmed rape scene, restored on my copy, a scene that I find to be the most intense. However, today's moviegoers may not agree.So see "Straw Dogs," the movie that single-handedly turned me into a Peckinpah fan. The editing is Oscar-worthy, the acting is magnificent, the situations are well thought out, and the characters are fleshed to the bone (sometimes literally). I promise you won't leave disappointed.#5 on my Top 200 List, **** outta **** on my personal scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Pecknpah followed his extremely violent and critically acclaimed 'The Wild Bunch' with the even more violent 'Straw Dogs', which didn't sit as well with the critics; in fact, 'Straw Dogs' was shocking enough to be banned in the UK where it was filmed, although in the US it was released with an X rating. Critics attacked it as being overtly violent and sexual, and entirely missed the message Peckinpah was making. Three and a half decades later, though, it's easier to appreciate 'Straw Dogs' for the groundbreaking creation that it was, and its influence can clearly be seen in the works of such contemporary directors as David Fincher, David Lynch and Todd Solondz, among others.With hindsight, it's hard to miss the fact that the sexual and violent content of 'Straw Dogs' isn't a whole lot more shocking than that of Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange', released that very same month. 'A Clockwork Orange' also created its own share of controversy, of course; yet somehow it was more rapidly recognized as the masterpiece it is by critics than 'Straw Dogs'. In part, I think that's due to the fact that while 'A Clockwork Orange' is an ultra-violent surreal fantasy from its very beginning, 'Straw Dogs' seems entirely innocent at first, like a very realistic and light-hearted drama, and the violence builds gradually throughout the film. That sense of realism, which 'A Clockwork Orange' never pretends to, makes 'Straw Dogs' much more difficult to take as an analogy; it cries out to be taken at face value, which makes it much more difficult to swallow.Dustin Hoffman was never an actor to fear controversy, and 'Straw Dogs' catches him right at the peak of his best years as an actor, after 'The Graduate', 'Midnight Cowboy' and 'Little Big Man', and before 'Lenny', 'Papillon' and 'All The President's Men'. His performance is as amazing as in any of these, and again Hoffman proves his rare range, as well as his sensitivity; his performance carries the film to true excellence, and perhaps that's the other reason that the film was a bit more difficult to take than 'A Clockwork Orange' ? to take nothing away from the wonderful Malcolm McDowell, what 'A Clockwork Orange' simply didn't have was a protagonist for the viewer to identify with, and therefore, like I stated before, it was easier to take as an analogy, and Alex functioned more as a symbolic and iconic character than as a real human being. David Sumner, on the other hand, is a remarkably realistic and convincing character, and one that is very easy to relate to, which makes the change that comes over him towards the end of the film all the more shocking. Again, it is that building up of tension that makes 'Straw Dogs' such a powerful experience.'Straw Dogs' is a film that creates controversy and disagreements, and so it should. It's easy to create controversy with sex and violence; but many years later that initial shock fades, and the real test is whether or not the film stands the trial of time and still manages to shock and engross. Like 'A Clockwork Orange', 'Straw Dogs' stands that test. Love it or hate it, it's hard to deny that it's an important and influential film, and it's essential viewing for any film lover.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Example of Early 1970s Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Straw Dogs(1971) reveals a primal human action that is the driving force behind its characters. As with Deliverance(1972), Straw Dogs also is fascinated with the violent urge within the human soul. The primal aspect of the human being is provocatively examined in Straw Dogs(1971). Sam Peckinpah forcefully depicts issues that were hinted at in The Wild Bunch(1969). Paints a dark picture of humanity with the person's frightening ability to harm at any time. The title of the film ties in perfectly with the nature of the story.An interesting example of a vigilante film before the subgenre became fashionable. Films before had dealt with the theme of revenge but rarely as brutal or primal as in Straw Dogs(1971). Predates Death Wish(1974) by three years. The uncredited inspiration for Death Wish(1974) and others of its kind. Both films include Meek liberal men who explode with violent anger in different ways. Shows revenge and the consequences behind the act of revenge in a realistic dimension.Straw Dogs(1971) marked the first film Sam Peckinpah did which wasn't a Western. The film's direction creates a powerful piece of cinema with a strong European sensibility. Its a shame Sam Peckinpah never did more European Thrillers after SD. One film which mixes the American style of Peckinpah's Westerns with the European touch of Straw Dogs(1971) is Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia(1974). At times the movie looks as if it could have been done by Hammer Studios. An indication that the late filmmaker could succeed outside of the Western genre.Good at showing that any person(even peaceful natured)can be capable of violent action at any given moment. The interactions between David Sumner and the Village Reverand is filled with subtle hostility. Represents the conflict between religion and science which is wittily enforced in the dialogue between the two. The locations of Cornwall becomes an important part of the film's emotion. Intense atmosphere is what gives the film a tinge of horror. Straw Dogs(1971) is in a couple of ways a British take on the Deliverance story.There seems to be something autobiographical within the frames of the story. Deals with the idea of Man's violent rites of passage that Sam Peckinpah was only too familiar with. David Sumner symbolizes the private inner self of Sam Peckinpah's persona. The intense relationship between David and Amy Sumner was based on the director's experiences with marriage and relations with women. His direction of the actors is masterful. Has to be one of the director's most personal(perhaps his most personal)film of his directorial resume.A notorious sequence from Straw Dogs(1971) is the infamous rape of Amy Sumner which plays a tricky balance between the abhorrent and the erotic without spilling over to either side. I can imagine the many people that were taken aback by this scene especially during the first rape when it turns into a love scene. Without the dark humor that was present in Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange(1971). Excellently edited scene with some powerful intercutting. Not an overly graphic scene but more psychological with the camera's focus on Susan George's face. Its the psychological abasement and reaction of Amy that is the true disturber of the senses.There is an interesting sub plot between Henry Niles and Janice Hedden that is inspired by OF MICE AND MEN. The director was heavily influenced by the works of John Steinbeck, none so evident as in the characterizations of Henry Niles. Henry Niles is absolutely patterened after the strong but slow witted Lenny from OF MICE &amp; MEN. David Warner pulls off an fantastic performance in a complex role. The scene in the church stable is reminiscent of Lenny and his bosses wife meeting in a barn during OF MICE &amp; MEN. Henry Niles is alot like the misunderstood alleged witch of Don't Torture a Duckling(1972).From the very beginning a confrontation between the house workers and David Sumner becomes inevitable. There is some major tension that grows to a boiling point until the hot pot explodes during the climax. The actors do a convincing job in displaying tension with their emotions. When the confrontation finally does happen everything becomes chaotic and violent. This part of the film may have influneced Wes Craven to a certain extent when he did Last House on the Left(1971). By the climax of Straw Dogs, David Sumner despises the house workers so much that he uses Henry Niles as an excuse to strike back at them.Where the bloodbath at the film's finale reaches a fever pitch is when reason turns to bloodlust. When the confrontation began there were reasons for each group but as it progressed the two parties become more interested in killing each other. I find it funny that the two groups become less concern in finding Janice Hedden and more concern in fighting to the death. It just shows that protecting one's land or property is the most important thing to a man. David Sumner and the house workers battle each other in a manner similar to the landowners of the Middle Ages. Sombre use of slow motion effects and editing techniques turns the climax into a nerve twister.Dustin Hoffman is very good in the role of the timid turned violent David Sumner. Susan George in her role projects both vurnability and eroticism. The film's climax would be rehased for the house attack in The Osterman Weekend(1983). When Sam Peckinpah also worked as a writer in his films the results were usually brilliant. This is the case with Straw Dogs(1971). Straw Dogs(1971) is an impressive film of an era when filmmakers were not afraid to take chances with risky subject matters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Straw Dogs" Isn't a film that I had ever heard of and then if I had I can't say that I would have instantly wanted to watch it, but as it was part of my Media Studies A-Level I sat back and watched in a hope to learn anything that I could. Before watching the film I was inform of history of the film and the banning and I prepared myself for a shocking rape scene and a horrific climax of an ending, yet I was wrong. Instead I found a sensitivly handled subject that any director or actor should be proud to be apart of. The fact that the censors wished to edit this scene in a way to take out a majority of the second rape only made me question the ideas of the censors and not director Sam Peckinpah or actress Susan George for wishing to make such a scene. The direction and acting came together to make a scene that should be celebrated not damn simply because it is a topic that is difficult to digest. The ending of the film that last almost a third of the movie is just as brilliant as any day hi-tech scene that you will see in any action film today. Overall this film is a stunning comment on the behaviour of men and women and their interactions and representation within a film. With amazing dialogue, acting out of this world and direction with such a clear knowledge of the industry I feel honoured that I have seen this film and strongly recommend that if anyone ever gets the chance to see it they should. Ignore whatever you hear and see it for yourself, it's mind blowing!!! 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Society in denial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the same year as Clockwork Orange, at the height of the Vietnam War, Peckinpah tried to bring his message into the present. Behind the thin veneer of civilization lies a monster worse than the barbarians of the hill country. By refusing to meet each challenge and take the consequences, the protagonist, like Western Civilization, allows the conflict to escalate to the point where extreme horror appears justified. The inevitable march to the macabre resolution, leaves lots of room for speculation about who the villains are and how much of the world around us is our own doing. This movie, like its Kubrick contemporary, was major ratings controversy because the sex and violence was "disturbing" - unlike the real thing which seems like so much fun on TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is certainly possible to look at STRAW DOGS as nothing more than a simple story of a man defending his house, his animalistic insides unleashed by a group of Cornish hoodlums. On that level alone it is a terrific piece of film-making backed up with highly textured acting from the two principals. But there are layers and layers and layers in this film, and that is what makes it art, and a masterpiece. Peckinpah himself told people that Dustin Hoffman was the heavy, and the movie was a portrait of a bad marriage. Try watching with those two facts in mind, and the film takes on a whole new complexion. The Criterion Collection two-disc set of STRAW DOGS is excellent, from the Peckinpah documentary to interviews with Susan George and the producer, to the audio commentary track. I agree with other reviewers who stressed that Peckinpah wasn't interested in "solving" problems; he wanted us to look at ourselves, and cringe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic thriller that holds its own after 30 years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Straw Dogs is an intense thriller that shows what can happen when you push even the most mild mannered man too far. Dustin Hoffman plays a mathematician who temporarily moves to a house in a rural village in England with his wife, a former resident of the town, played by Susan George. The two withstand incessant needling from several of the townsfolk until George is raped and assaulted and Hoffman is pushed over the edge.Incidentally, right after watching this film I found a documentary on cable about filmmakers from the late '60s to late '70s and one of the directors profiled was Sam Peckinpah. I had always considered his films to be violent and vaguely shocking, which never surprised me, knowing that he was a hard-living maverick who did things his way - an element that is resplendent in most of his films. A brief mention of Straw Dogs was included in this documentary, where they described it as a "sexist film". There are obvious scenes in the film that could support this criticism, but I think that is overanalyzing the film with a political correctness that is out of place. While the two female characters are both victimized, Susan George also has her moments of empowerment. I may be a female, but I don't consider Peckinpah's tendency to make testosterone-driven films any more sexist than anything that Tarantino puts out, and I'm a big fan of his work as well. It's a dangerous line to draw when one labels a film due to what is *not* included in a film. What this film does contain is much more stellar - Hoffman is beyond incredible in this film. His character development is amazing to experience. One criticism of the film that I heard from a friend who saw it before me was that it "dragged." I couldn't disagree more. The development of the story until the extremely violent climax is a perfect pace because it made me feel like I was sitting in a dentist chair, knowing that this low boil could explode at any time. After the dust settles, the viewer is left to decide whether Hoffman's character made the right decision, and left to speculate on the ramifications of the choices made. This is by far one of the best films I've seen in recent months and plan to seek out the newly released Criterion edition in my quest to find out as much about this film as I can.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another reason the 70's film industry rocked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one down and dirty film, now judging by some of the responses on these boards there might be some aspects that are dated but for me this film was a revelation. Yeah the build up is slow ( if you suffer from severe ADD, which seems to be the case with most people) its necessary, we are dealing with the animalistic nature of man and how despite the amount of time we have had to evolve all it takes to get the dog in us aroused is a hot chick with no bra.There have been many intelligent men in our time that have succumbed to the alluring beauty of women. Dustin Hoffman's character is a mathematician who seems to revel in his intelligence, he married a young hot piece of ass who right from the beginning is aware of her sexuality, they retreat to a small town which is necessary in adding to the provocation of these guys, good looking sheep probably get these guys going. Hoffman is too wrapped up in his own head to realize that his young wife's needs are being compromised.Susan George really does a great job portraying the type of young naive women that most man would give too much credit to. There is nothing more dangerous that a young hot girl and a guy has got to be aware of it always or she will ruin you either intentionally or not. Anyway that first shot of her walking down the street really showed the power of this girl, shes innocently aware of herself and doesn't really grasp the danger reflected in the way the local boys look at her, and the way they thrust their machismo at Dustin's character, there is such a basic element being thrown around these scenes, and damn Dustin for his cowardice nature. Anyway the further we move along the more of a build up we get, its necessary because it makes the rape and the seige that much more believable.Now the rape scene is completely disturbing because of Susan George's reaction to it, and for 1971 I can see how it was viewed as mysoginistic and depraved. IF we look at it its speaks volumes towards who we are as man and women. You know what? she did like it, she also hated the fact that she liked it, she hated herself for liking it, she was confused and conflicted by her feelings, her feelings for the first act with a guy that was acting the way she wished her husband did, it helps also that she did date this guy before. to say that she thought of her husband and was in some kind of dream like state is more of a diservice to the nature of women that what really went on. What she didn't like was the sodomy by some other guy, while the first dude held her down, it went too far. It became scary to her, she had no control whats so ever and it scared her. This scene made me uncomfortable because it turned me on and repelled me the same way it did to her character. To unleash my base male nature, she was hot, the actresses in the 70's especially the british and italians were drop dead sexy and georgeous, they don't make them like that any more.Finally this whole business about the pederast who kills that girl and becomes the center point of the seige. I love the irony, I love the blurred line of right and wrong, what makes me uncomfortable are the implications of this storyline. This was not the pederast's fault in a sense, it was the fault of another young women who wanted to have the same effect on men that Susan George did, she wasn't as well aware of herself and unfortunately tried to go the easy route by seducing a mentally unstable man. Now this poor b**tard didn't have a chance and he accidently killed her, was it her fault Not necessarily but the implications are there and that is too much truth for me.Anyway the whole irony is that this guy is no better or now worse than the guys that raped Susan, he is probably alot better but he doesn't have the mentallity to control his animal urges but he tries, the other guys don't even try to contol theirs. The final seige was interesting in the way that Susan George acted, and I feel this is all based on Nieztche's view of women, you know they have no understanding of loyalty or such they do not think like men, on principle alone. Women always want men to take the easy way out of things, the logical way, why make things hard for stupid reasons. Well men do. Dustin decides on that night that he is not going to supress his animal side, he is going to be a man for once and stand up to both the primal aggression around him and the true nature of women.Look this films shows the flaws and the strengths of both sexes, it shakes up what society has made each sex believe is the way they should act, how we have disregarded our true nature that when it rears its ugly head it can really cause problems. We are not that far evolved.Love this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The granddaddy of the modern revenge flick and still potent after 30 years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dustin Hoffman is perfectly cast as wealthy American mathematician David Sumner. Soon after arriving to an isolated English village with his energetic young wife Amy (the captivating Susan George), trouble starts. You see, she's so attractive the men in town can't keep from leering at her, he's such a pacifist the locals feel at ease to push him around and the jealousy over David's wealth, power, intelligence and wife turn to a series of harassments, one more extreme than the next until Amy is brutally beaten and raped. David finally snaps and decides he's had enough when their assailants accidentally kill a cop and then hold them at bay in their own home. Not a horror film in the traditional sense, this (one of the most controversial movies of the 1970s) is nonetheless an effective, violent and relevant piece of shock cinema. Peckinpah's statement is that in this world, like it or not, there is a genuine need for violence and he concentrates most on uncovering how common emotions (jealousy, vengeance, lust) can turn seemingly normal men evil. Containing strong performances from the entire cast, STRAW DOGS has been copied many times since, but seldom this effectively.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peckinpah's post- 'Wild Bunch' movies were a mixed bag. Frequently battling studios, censors and/or his own demons, some are genuine classics ('..Alfredo Garcia'), some are entertaining potboilers ('The Getaway'), and some like 'Straw Dogs' are in between. I could never argue that this movie is his best work, but it is far from his worst, and whatever you can say about his movies, they are ALWAYS interesting.'Straw Dogs' is the closest he came to making a genre horror/thriller movie. If you enjoy 'Rio Bravo'-inspired siege movies such as Romero's 'Night Of The Living Dead' or Carpenter's 'Assault On Precinct 13', check this one out. But it is more than "just" a thriller - it features strong character development, and morally ambiguous situations among the tense build up to the explosive climax. In these P.C. times 'Straw Dogs' offers no simple answers, but plenty of issues for discussion, and it is to be commended for that. "Right" or "wrong"? YOU decide!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disturbing, in a way, more for what it suggests than what it shows, and how it leads head-on through its conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Pecikinpah's Straw Dogs might not be one of his very best films- after seeing the Wild Bunch it attempts the same level of psychological intensity but not the overall weight with the ensemble form- but it always kept me interested and glued to the screen. This is the kind of film, or at least has many a scene, that would work greatly in psychology and women's studies courses in colleges, to really get a real debate going about what is going on with these people. It brings issues of social class, society in general (and where you come from mostly, i.e. Brits vs. Americans), rape, violence, and a certain male domineering way that undoes everything. It's charged with an unusual Dustin Hoffman performance and Peckinpah's disorienting but exciting way of editing his scenes. These are all fractured people, and some of these scenes are fractured to the point of a kind of unhinged, brilliant disturbance. But its really the subject matter that kicks things into people's mind sets, and what is and what isn't usually shown on screen. Hence, what is suggested becomes about as powerful as what is really laid on thick on screen (particularly in the 2nd half).The main centerpiece of the film sticks this in and doesn't let up, and one wonders why logic never seems to intervene. Perhaps because this is more of a kind of treatise on behavior than any kind of typical revenge story. This centerpiece- where Susan George's character gets raped by an ex-boyfriend, and then gang raped by the men working on her and her husband David's (Hoffman) garage- acts as the first tip of the scale in what becomes un-hinged for them in this little British community. It's at first, of course, a real sexual crime as he forces himself upon her. But then, apparently, she succumbs to it and becomes lusting towards the man who once was close to her. But then the other men come in, pointing a gun at him to get up, he does, and then the full-on rape ensues. This is all edited (along with Hoffman, oblivious, off on a strange Quail hunt) to maximum efficiency, and is probably one of the more provoking scenes from any film of the 70s. Is this really more of a male viewpoint, the typical 'no means yes' thought process by the director, or is there something even deeper not being read right off the bat? Or is it clear as day that this is just the real, shattering force to drive the rest of the film? The latter might be truer to me. This then becomes further complicated later in the film as the men break into the house, and what preceded it with the tension she has with David.Then, as the film rolls into its final chapters, as Henry Niles (David Warner, always good) has been hit by accident by David driving home and taken in, is suspected of murder of a girl. "This is my home, I can't let them in" says David, and so the violence becomes widespread, almost bordering over the top (i.e. bear-trap). It comes about as close as one could figure to the final act of The Wild Bunch, and it has that same visceral impact. But in a way, these scenes aren't really AS engaging as some other ones, like a very tense scene where before all of this happens David and Amy (George) go to some Catholic shindig, where her visions of what just happened, surrounded by the very same men who committed the act, are compacted into something quite terrible for her. This editing job, headed by three editors, is quite eye-catching, if of the period, and sets the tone for everything that takes place. It's quite the subjective movie, a precursor perhaps to Taxi Driver. But this is not to say I thought the film flawless- George's performance, while occasionally gripping and sincere, usually didn't do it for me and almost made the character too thin to really understand (maybe only till the very end does her character come full circle). It also has a couple of last lines that are either very good or very annoying. And some of the early scenes in the film make a little too obvious what the mood might become.But all of this aside, Straw Dogs works as a film meant to turn the heat up about what it means to reach the 'breaking point' for both men and women, who are far from being very 'good' people but try not to be evil either. The ones that are made to be the antagonists are almost cartoonish (one of the British thugs practically can't stop laughing, that is until he breaks into the house). There's a lot that can be read into this film, and it might even work better for me on a repeat viewing. It's controversy doesn't really wane thirty-five years later, and it questions the actions of almost all involved, almost asking us to judge, but presenting us in general with a vision into a kind of hell. Hence why it might work best in psychology classes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Confused Movie More Than Anything Else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember more than 20 years ago STRAW DOGS was avaliable for rental along with video nasty crap like I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE , ABSURD and NIGHT OF THE DEMON . What set SD apart from the other titles was that it was the only video on the shelf with a sticker proclaiming " For over 18s only . Not to be rented to children " . It should also be remembered that everytime Channel 4 has thought about screening it the channel changes its mind at the last minute. In short STRAW DOGS has a reputation as an extreme film even more extreme than say A CLOCKWORK ORANGE so when Channel 4 at long last decided to screen it late last year I decided there was no way I was going to miss it!!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILERS !!!!!Despite the hype I failed to see what the fuss was about . Ah yes that "rape" scene . It wasn`t rape with the first man but it was certainly rape with the second . I think . But I`m not sure , mainly down to the directing. I think . That`s the problem with this movie - It`s very difficult to understand the point Sam Peckinpah is trying to make and much of the story takes some swallowing . Uberwimp David Sumner decides he`s going to take a stand and protect a suspected murderer from a lynch mob ? Hmmm . I guess that this ridiculous turn of events had a motive behind it because whatever motive he had seemed to take place off screenIt could be easy to blame the screenwriters for much of the unexplained motives in the story but Peckinpah should take the blame for the film`s flaws . Dustin Hoffman and Susan George as David and Amy Sumner a newly wed couple ? One of the most unlikely onscreen couples in the history of cinema in my opinion . And did anyone laugh out loud as I did at the end when after a violent bloodbath David turns to the blood soaked Amy and asks " You all right ? " . What a bloody stupid questionAnd when you stop to think about it STRAW DOGS is a bloody stupid film . However I can`t help thinking Peckinpah knew fine well what he was doing when he made it and was aware of how the critics and moral guardians would take it when it was released . In short Sam Peckinpah is having a laugh at the expense of the establishment . It`s not his best film ( Choose between CROSS OF IRON or THE WILD BUNCH ) but it is his most extreme and infamous film and that alone makes it worth watching</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This is where I live. This is me. I will not allow violence against this house."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah's 'Straw Dogs' begins peacefully enough, offering only a few subtle hints of the graphic rape that would form the centerpiece of the film, and unbridled violence that would comprise the harrowing final act. David Sumner (a brilliant Dustin Hoffmann, 'All The President's Men'), an American mathematician, arrives in a quaint Cornwall town to be met with a certain level of hostility. He and his British wife, Amy (Susan George), have moved back into Amy's hometown to escape violence and crime in the United States. The irony of this motivation, even at the beginning of the film, is not lost.David is very much an introvert. The job of a mathematician requires hours of quiet time to think and ponder, something he just can't get. His wife Amy is immature and disruptive, though we can't blame her; David has little time for her amidst all his mathematical calculations, and he treats her cries for attention as one treats a child, at one point telling her "you act like you're fourteen years old." As days go by, David and Susan face increasing levels of harassment from the local residents, most particularly the four young local men who have been employed to build their garage. The harassment begins quite modestly, with David ? the outsider ? becoming the butt of local jokes, whether it be because he has trouble trying to start his battered old car, or because he tries to enter it from the wrong side. On his first visit to the pub, David requests "any American brand of cigarettes," an unwise move if you wish to make friends amongst the fiercely patriotic country folk of Cornwall. He would later buy the stone-faced men around him a round of drinks, but doesn't sit around to enjoy it with them.After a somewhat leisurely opening thirty minutes, we suddenly recognise that things are getting serious when Susan's cat goes missing. This event in itself is not particularly ominous, since the cat goes missing all the time. However, when David pulls on the light switch in his bedroom closet, he is understandably startled to find his strangled cat dangling limp from the cord. Despite his insistence that "it could have been anyone passing by," we already know who murdered "kitty." David vows to confront the four local men, endeavouring to "catch them off guard" and force a confession. However, given David's typically shy and pacifistic nature, he subsequently loses his courage and backs down.David's "confrontation" invariably ends in his accepting an invitation to go hunting the following day. Whilst David takes pot-shots at the passing birds (with little result), one of the men, Charlie Venner (Del Henney), a former lover of Susan, drops into the house. Susan demands that he leave, but he casually casts aside her pleas and starts to kiss her. Susan resists at first but, shockingly, at times she appears to return his affection. Nevertheless, the rape scene is difficult to watch, and Peckinpah masterfully intercuts the quickly-cut scene with images of David standing obliviously amongst the scrub, still actively trying to shoot down ducks. Another of the men arrives at the home, and a second uncomfortable rape scene follows. Once it is all over, we find David finally shooting down a bird, only to find that it isn't a duck. Disappointed that he has made such a careless mistake, he drops the dead bird into a bush, no doubt assured that the worst thing to happen today was his inability to hunt. When he next sees Susan, she says nothing to him; and she never will.When a mildly mentally-challenged local man, Henry Niles (David Warner, who was uncredited due to insurance complications), also a convicted child molester, accidentally murders a teenage girl who made advances towards him, the drunken father of the girl wants his retribution. Niles, stumbling through a heavy onset of fog, finds his way in front of David and Susan's car, and they bring him to their home until medical assistance can arrive. However, the murdered girl's father and the four men who had been building David's garage turn up outside his house with only one thing on their minds: getting inside that house and getting to Niles. The previously mild-mannered David, on the other hand, has alternative plans for these men.The title of the film is drawn from a common translation of 'Tao Te Ching', an ancient Chinese philosophical treatise: "Heaven and Earth are impartial; they see the ten thousands things as straw dogs. The wise are impartial; they see the people as straw dogs." Many ancient Chinese ceremonies included the use of grass-woven dogs, which were revered and respected during the ritual, but afterward discarded and burnt. Perhaps the title symbolises David's underlying attitudes towards human lives as the men begin to invade his home ? we are all straw dogs, made only to be destroyed.Whilst David's moral reasoning for defending his home is to prevent Niles' bloody death at the hands of the mob, he appears to take grim satisfaction in murdering the intruders himself. Once all are good and dead (the most nasty mode of death involving a fully-sprung bear trap), David stands aside, a peculiar grin evident upon his face, exclaiming to himself, "Jesus. I got 'em all!" He is not disgusted or sickened by the deaths he has forced himself to orchestrate ? he is actually satisfied, invigorated. He is proud of his achievements.What could have possibly precipitated this sudden change in David's character? From a logical, mild-mannered, peaceful man arose a methodical killing machine, who shockingly takes pleasure in his multiple kills. Then we suddenly realise. These qualities were within David the entire time. Indeed, they subconsciously inhabit the hearts of all men. He just required the horrific circumstances of that night to bring about the alarming conversion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peckinpah's most notorious film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Straw Dogs is banned on TV and video in the United Kingdom.Allegedly, the violence and sex in it are too much, even for adultviewers. I find this argument preposterous, since the film is lessviolent than Reservoir Dogs, less sexually explicit than Damage,and less mindless than any 18-certifcate Arnold Schwarzeneggerfilm of the 80s or 90s. It tells of an American scientist living in a backwoods part ofCornwall who is humiliated and attacked by the locals when hetries to protect a mentally ill man from them. These same localsalso take a liking to his wife, and in one famous scene, they rapeher while he is out duck shooting. The rape scene is effective, but not really as offensive as peoplehave suggested. There's a weirdness about it, because the victimSusan George seems to encourage her attackers rather thanresist them, and this is one of the main reasons that the scenehas been condemned by so many. However, I felt that it merelyadded to the character's actions and made the rape believablerather than exploitative. This is one of Peckinpah's best, with only Cross of Iron, The WildBunch and Ride the High Country in the same league. It's hard toenjoy, but equally hard to forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now that the controversy has gone, an interesting, if flawed film remains</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American scholar David Summer and his wife return to her home village in Cornwall to give him peace and quiet to write his book on astrophysics. However Amy meets up with her old boyfriend and his friends, who offer to carry out repairs on the house for David. He agrees but finds that the locals treat him as an outsider resulting in further pressure on the Summer's already fracturing marriage.I, like many of the reviews written here by users in the UK, took the opportunity to watch this film when it came on tv for the first time in the UK since it was released. I deliberately taped it and left it for a month or so before watching as I wanted it to be free of the hype and controversy that the network had stirred up with documentaries just before they screened it. Watching it away from all this it is difficult to see what all the fuss was about in some regards. Certainly what is socially acceptable in a film today is far beyond what was passed by censors then.The plot is a strange mix of relationship drama and western. It is easy to focus on the stand off element of this film and the violence of the second half, but I don't think that that is what the film was about. One user called the first hour or so `a very slow build up', however by saying that, the suggestion is that the film only exists to deliver the concluding part. Rather, I got more from the film as a whole and found the `build up' to be interesting as it showed David's marriage cracking and crumpling, slowing exposing the issues and frustrations that exist just below the surface in their relationship. The fact that the action at the end of the film is relating to the underlying frustration Amy had with her husband's inability to `take a stand', indicates that this is the focus of the film.Regardless of this, it still isn't a fantastic film. It is very slow at times and not all of it has been as well developed as hoped. Cornish locals are all mistrusting inbred hicks who are shifty says the film, which may or may not be true but it would have been better to have a better mix of local characters. The rape scene itself is difficult because for part of it Amy submits and appears to be enjoying and consenting, before others get involved and it becomes full violent rape. Questions over other issues suggests that the film maybe lingers to long on disturbing scenes but the fact that the film also shows the aftermath of the rape is to it's credit.Due to the stereotyping, not all the actors get a chance to do good work. Hoffman is OK but I found his character difficult to get into. George is not as well developed as I would have hoped but is improved after her ordeal. The support cast of locals are not allowed to go much further than `get off me land' cliché and give lesser performances as a result.Overall this was an interesting film as it all seems to be focused on the couple's marriage rather than the detail of who is being sheltered in what house etc. Taken on this level it is still far from perfect. The only thing I'm sure of is that anyone drawn to the film simply because of the hype in the press will probably miss the point altogether.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>reacting as an animal to an animal doesn't make you an animal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somehow this movie reminds me of a scene in "A King in New York" where the king (Charles Chaplin) goes to visit a school and the pupils start throwing pieces of cake at him. At the beginning he tries to act dignified and ignore it, but then he ends up also throwing pieces of cake. Dustin Hoffman is David, a peaceful guy who starts being provoked by the hoodlums he contracted to fix his garage. He does not know their real bad characters so he is caught off guard and his lack of reaction can be attributed to that. He is far from being a coward as the film will show later on. Susan George is his wife Amy who makes a point of being sexy. She starts feeling her husband is a coward and her contradictory feelings during the magnificently made rape scene are an unconscious reaction to that. When the second man shows up to rape her, the humiliation which was already unbearable is multiplied. A similar situation occurs between Niles, the town idiot, and a girl. David gives Niles shelter in his house. The irony of the film is that the hoodlums come to lynch Niles for a crime they just practiced. David answers them on the same level. Did he become an animal like them? Definitely not, the bitter truth is that one does not always choose the weapons he fights with. This is Peckinpah's best film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Banned for years, worth the wait?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BIG SPOILERSWell, after however many years it was that this film was banned for, eventually it became viewable. Was this really worth the wait? Truthfully, yes. Hoffman is surprisingly stunning as a mild mannered pacifist who goes completely tonto in defending his house. The violence is graffic &amp; once the drunks begin to attack the house, this film switches from an almost detailed portrayal of quiet yet intimidating rural life to what feels more like a piece of Terminator style action. This film was understandably banned for quite a long time as not only is it explicitly violent, but a rape scene half way through the film (which sadly is what the film is most famous for) is both explicit &amp; almost possitive towards the notion of rape. George's almost enjoyment at the first of the two rapes (both done one after the other) is worrying in itself &amp; understandably condemned.However, despite the negativity of the portrayal of the rape scene and the admittedly slow beginning, this film is worth watching. Perhaps not as stunning as a lot of reviews claim, but by no means as bad as others claim either. Go into this film with an open mind, don't abandon it after twenty minutes and be prepared to see a side of Dustin Hoffman that not many people probably expected to witness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah's legendary film is a must see. Dustin Hoffman and Susan George move into a farm house in the English countryside and soon become fodder (sexual and otherwise) for the local ne'er do wells. Hoffman, a mathematician, is either a self-righteous peacenik or a cowardly nelly (depending on your point of view). The film is electrifying and makes a solid case for the argument that anyone is capable of violence if pushed far enough. It's unflinching and never obvious. Hoffman is great (he still looked like Benjamin Braddock!) and Susan George, despite really bad teeth, is quite a number. The scene of her getting raped is repellent. Not just because the act itself is abhorrent, but also because George is clearly enjoying the assault. The local hooligans are genuinely scary. David Warner makes an appearance as the village idiot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A riveting and eerily plausible thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the help of a research grant, timid astrophysicist David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman) travels to England with British wife Amy (Susan George.) Hoping to escape the violent protests of Vietnam-era America, the two settle down in Amy's hometown, a tiny village in Cornwall, where less-than-friendly locals take it upon themselves to make their lives a living hell.There's a list a mile long of all the things that work in this movie, but the single biggest contributor is Peckinpah's refusal to cut corners.Many a movie that bills itself on the basis of its climax forgets that crescendos are a privilege and not a right; that they must be earned, that they must be paid for. Do the Right Thing, great though it is, never fully invests itself in the question of why this particular hot day is the catalyst for disaster when so many other hot days have come and gone without incident. While the climax might conceivably develop from the events depicted, an abundance of unanswered questions leaves it feeling more like writer's convenience, and less like natural construction.With Straw Dogs, the outcome is both possible and inevitable, and Peckinpah has us convinced of that fact within the first ten minutes of the running time. In ten minutes flat, we have the perfect storm of troubled marriages, the Sumners just passionate enough to excite the ire of a former lover, and just defunct enough to preclude the kind of unity they need to stand strong. We have a town in shambles, where the lawman is impotent and the closest approximation to a moral authority is an ill-tempered drunkard whose son is a rapist. We have a band of hooligan locals, tied to the married couple by a rubber stamp construction job (a garage that's never finished) and led by Amy's one-time Charlie Venner (Del Henney) who get their kicks out of exploiting David's apparent lack of virility and drive a wedge into the already fraught relationship in the hopes of getting Amy alone. We have unanimous contempt for the American outsider, and shame for the English woman who lowered herself by marrying him. We have a town madman whom the entire village is clamoring to kill, along with whoever else gets in their way, and last but not least, we have the ubiquitous glass of whiskey to push people past the breaking point when every other aggravating factor fails, all this rendered naturally and believably in the first ten minutes of the film. The rest of the movie is one big bi-product, the story flowing from A to B to C, each plot point a direct consequence of the one preceding it, everything building steadily and irrevocably to one of the most horrific and well-earned climaxes in cinematic history.Hoffman's performance as the high-strung astrophysicist edging closer and closer to the brink is one of the best of his career, if only because of its subtlety, its slow transformation. Susan George is, in some ways, even stronger than Hoffman. A boiling pot of rage and frustration, her character is truly heart wrenching, especially in the latter half of the film, as she struggles to rise above her morbid abuse. Best of all, the two actors behave as if they were actually married to each other, assuming all the tricks and gestures and mannerisms of that extreme, almost destructive level of physical comfort, something we rarely see in Hollywood matrimony.Straw Dogs is a spectacular film and a terrific western, adhering, as it does, to nearly ever convention of the genre. In the final analysis, David Sumner is just another gunman goaded into a showdown. The Scottish bagpipes at the apex of the movie, not unlike the horns that start playing whenever the gunslinger steps out of the saloon, drone away in haunting irony as David moves across the room, trance-like, his latent savagery shaking its way into wakefulness. With expert care, with every note true, Peckinpah frees the western from its moorings in 19th-century America and transports it to England, betraying both the timelessness of violence and ? unfortunately ? its international character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Strong Film That Touches On Many Social Subjects...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STRAW DOGS is not quite what I expected judging from the few reviews I read prior to my viewing. it seems that the strong violence and the much talked about rape scene are the focal points of the film in many viewer's minds. Personally, though these elements are extremely important to the narrative of the film - they are by no means what the film is all about...David and Amy Sumner move from the States to rural England to relax while David writes a text book. David is a mathematician and Amy is his hot young British wife who seems strangely incompatible with him. It's never really mentioned how the couple met or got together, but right off the top it's obvious that they're a mis-matched duo. The town that the Sumners move back to is a place that Amy lived in when she was younger, and she knows many of the locals. David is viewed as an outsider, and his nerdy countenance and weak physical appearance make him a target for the local toughs. The "teasing" begins innocently enough - but when it goes un-checked - escalates in it's intensity. Things come to a climax when Amy (unbeknownst to David) is raped by one of the locals, with whom she had had a relationship with several years past - and when David refuses to release a local man accused of child-molestation to the local thugs after David takes him in following an auto-accident. When David refuses to let the group make-off with the injured man, they attack his home in an effort to gain entry - but David has finally snapped and won't give up the shelter of his home so easily...With a few scenes of explosive violence and a rape scene that many unaccustomed to viewing such material will undoubtedly find objectionable, I supposed it's easy to lose track of the real "story" behind STRAW DOGS. This film is full of social commentary and personal relationship issues. For David, it begins as a fish-out-of-water story as he tries to make peace with the locals who obviously view him with complete disdain. For Amy, it's a coming home tale that has initially bittersweet overtones that turn just plain bitter by the film's conclusion. There is an underlying theme of how much abuse will someone take before they flake-out and fight back - even if the odds seem insurmountable. There's also a strong current that is felt from the opening of the film in regards to how men and women in general handle relationships and how they view each other and their respective "roles". Amy seems to want a "tougher" man than her husband - but when she gets it, she finds that it's not necessarily as fulfilling as she would have imagined, and when her own husband finally becomes the "tough-guy" - I think this revelation is forced upon her doubly. There really are a ton of concepts explored in the film and I've barely scratched the surface. As to the film itself - it begins slow and ends with a bang. Those that need non-stop action will not dig this one. Also, those that choose to view this film strictly for "shock-value" based on other reviews will more than likely be disappointed as well. The violence and rape were not as strong as I expected - but they're pretty "rough" for 1971. The performances are solid and believable and the storyline is definitely interesting and certainly holds much to reflect on. Overall, I enjoyed STRAW DOGS quite a bit and would recommend it to more open-minded thriller/drama fans...9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A passive American mathematician and his British wife move to a farm in rural England and are terrorized in their home by vicious locals. Gordon M. Williams' book "The Siege of Trencher's Farm" becomes a standardized Hollywood bout between Good and Evil, with Good having to stoop to the gutters in order to survive--which is really what life is all about, isn't it? Sam Peckinpah directed (and co-penned the script), and he delights in slavering savagery and carnality, with a motley gang of villainous goons taunting our hero, portrayed by actors who have no other character motivation to play beyond being villainous goons. It gets you worked up, all right, to the point of exasperation and exhaustion. Dustin Hoffman manages to create a tangible character, and his repressed anxiety and impotent anger is both frustrating and thought-provoking. However, there isn't much provocative about Peckinpah's staging of this violent tale; he's all about externals--how righteous anger destroys our common decency--and he can't even manage this without pushing the same old buttons, complete with a rape scene in which the victim, Susan George, does everything but smoke a cigarette afterward. The filmmaker has only one card to play, the tearing down of morality in the modern man, and he stretches this out so far his plot-points become battering rams. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Straw Dogs on its original cinema for two reasons: one, it was a movie which was in danger of disappearing in a cloud of controversy and, two, I fancied the pants off Susan George, and I'd heard that she got her kit off in this one.What I found was a very interesting story, powerfully told. Straw Dogs was so controversial, and was seen as so toxic, that it virtually disappeared as soon as its first run at the cinema was over. It was perceived as too dangerous for a video release (in the UK, at least) and has only fairly recently emerged on DVD.So what was all the fuss about? Sam Peckinpah's final film tells the story of a fairly unlikely marriage between fusty American academic David (Dustin Hoffman) and feisty young English thing Amy (Susan George). They take a cottage in the rural English countryside, in the general area of Amy's home patch: a peaceful bolt hole for David to carry out research. Amy, meanwhile, is picking up where she left off by teasing the local lads - this is clearly a game she is accustomed to playing, although it is clearly also partly out of frustration at David's lack of attention towards her. The local lads react to this, and bait David generally (he is mild, he is married to this teaser, he is an outsider), but David backs away from confrontation. Amy's antics have the inevitable result when she is forced into sex by old flame Charlie (Del Henney) and Norman (Ken Hutchison): this appears to be rape, but possibly it isn't: perhaps it is simply the sort of game Amy likes to play. Then they are approached for sanctuary by local mentally handicapped paedophile Henry (David Warner) who is being pursued by a local mob intent on applying lynch law, following Henry strangling local slapper Janice (under provocation). At this point David decides to take a stand, and the final section of the film deals with the mob laying siege to the cottage.Peckinpah went out with a bang. Full of morally compromised characters, this film ultimately addresses issues which are fairly black and white, and does so with a sense of gradually developing menace, leading to an intense and bloody climactic confrontation.Dustin Hoffman is excellent as the gentle David, provoked once too often, and the immature Amy is a role which might have been written for Susan George at this stage in her career.It is a strong and thought provoking movie - it is still doing that particular job with me nearly 40 years later.And, yes, Susan George does get her kit off. So that was a good result, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror Film Disguised as a Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young American (Dustin Hoffman) and his English wife (Susan George) come to rural England and face increasingly vicious local harassment. Also, David Warner shows up with his long 1970s hair and a limp to be a menace.People like to talk about the violence of this film, and say that what was strong then and what is strong now is different. Indeed, I do think the violence is tame by today's standards, but I think it was possibly even tame by those standards. It is hardly a massacre. And is it not awkward seeing Hoffman as a fighter? I mean, really. Great actor, yes, but not a fighter.The sexual assault scene, on the other hand, is just as raw now as it was then. While not as graphic as Peckinpah intended, it is pretty brutal. Other films have been nasty -- "Deliverance" and "I Spit on Your Grave", or more recently "Derailed -- but this certainly made a mark. Besides one or two other films (notably "The Virgin Spring") this had to be one of the earliest showings of such a thing and must have shocked viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The old Hollywood production code required that justice be rewarded and evil punished, the last genre to hold onto this concept was the Western (and prime time television). Violence was always highly selective; you might see the good guy wounded once in a while, but it was almost always the "deserving" bad guys who got killed. This reflected the U.S. mainstream view of violence and of pre-Viet Nam foreign affairs. What made 'The Wild Bunch' revolutionary was that Peckinpah made violence universal. Everyone stood in the same shade of gray/neutral moral middle-ground and everyone; men, women, children, dogs, and chickens were shot up in the final scene, regardless of their guilt or innocence. Then along comes 'Straw Dogs' and Peckinpah makes another violent anti-violence film where the moral distinctions between victims (be they physical or psychological victims) is again ambiguous. The film opens with a processional of Amy and 'Wannabee Amy' (Sally Thomsett in a dead-on Lolita performance) turning all the male heads as they walk through the village. And this introduces us to the parallel stories that will be taking place during the film. Amy will spend much of her time amusing herself by provocatively arousing a group of young men in the village. Thomsett's character will spend her time flirting with Amy's husband David (the Dustin Hoffman character) and with the village idiot (David Warner doing Lon Chaney's Lennie from 'Mice and Men'). Just one year removed from playing an innocent child in 'The Railway Children' Thomsett is perfect as every father's nightmare of a post-pubescent boy-crazy daughter. Peckinpah's theme is about personal responsibility (and irresponsibility) and how actions have consequences. Amy and 'Wannabee Amy' will play with fire during the first part of the movie. Amy will tease the young men of the village, will playfully run them off the road with her car, and will fearlessly challenge them about killing her cat. She will even become a willing participant in what starts out as forced sex with her former boyfriend. But Amy will suffer the consequences when this is followed up by an actual rape. 'Wannabee Amy' will seduce the village idiot and suffer the consequences when he panics and accidentally kills her. At this point Amy wants no more consequences from her irresponsibility. But David stubbornly insists on protecting the village idiot until the authorities arrive. When the magistrate arrives and is killed by the five goons outside their house, David pragmatically concludes that the goons cannot let Amy and him live, even if they turn over the village idiot. Once cornered David must fight and reverts to primitive animalistic behavior. I think Peckinpah is telling us that we still have an innate instinctual capacity for violence and instinctual responses to violence, that women are still excited and attracted by these displays and may consciously or subconsciously incite them. Call it part of the courtship ritual, it probably has an evolutionary function. Starting with parallel story lines that occasionally touch each other before finally coming together, Peckinpah structures the film so that a third storyline then takes over. After Amy's need for excitement has set the events in motion and they have escalated beyond her control, she withdraws and refuses to deal with anything anymore. Her active role is then taken up by the formerly passive David, who until this point has been dodging confrontation. First he is pushed to a point where he stubbornly refuses to back down any further, and finally he is cornered with has no place to back down even if inclined to do so. I was very impressed with the work of the Production Designer on this film. The countryside, village, and house have a very uniform visual style that fits the storyline of a foreigner dealing with an insular community.I really have no problems with this film. I found it one of those few films that are riveting from the very start. During my initial viewing I recall hating the scene where David and Amy are arguing while sitting on opposite sides of the fireplace. I was mentally protesting 180- degree rule violations and the disorienting cuts. But by the end I realized that this visually reinforced the unraveling of their relationship; it is a good example of why movie-making conventions can be broken if breaking them advances the story line.'Straw Dogs' takes place in a Peckinpah world where men must be willing to do life's dirty work and anything else if they wish to survive, and where actions have consequences. This is a world where love has limits and might even be impossible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A typical plot that used to define men's basic instinct and values: the protection of family and honor. Yet Sam Peckinpah's little tale holds many folds and the explosion of violence splashes like fresh blood on the characters, alive or not, and us, the innocent viewers. And why us? because we followed, anxious and nervous, the plot as naively as the main character played by Hoffman; we refused to acknowledge situations opting instead for blind optimism ,and we watched in silent trepidation at the first blow ringing like a death toll, the uproar echoing the bell at a boxing game.An amazing hommage to how futile and traumatic violence can be, and at times so beautiful the fighters simply dance.</fullReview>

Too much is so over the top, there isn't a normal person in sight, the acting is below par for several leads and as a viewer you are left with three major questions: 1. whatever did Dustin Hoffman see in Susan George as a wife? 2. as for the grand finale of this movie: how many windows does this house have? 3. how many whiskies can a man drink and still behave at all?And when it does work it resembles the original Wicker Man film in all its dark sides.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie that has been the subject of heated debate for years is worth seeing. The revenge factor is played out to the fullest as Hoffman seeks vengeance against the men who raped his young sexy wife. Many feel that Amy, the character played by Susan George was "asking for it". In one scene she starts to undress knowing the men can see her. Later, as she is being raped she at first refuses but then "enjoys" it. There is another man who comes in after she has been raped who appears to sodomize her, but this appears to be edited out of the version I saw. Many people view this movie as sexist and understandably so. Hoffman awakes from his cowardly state to defend that which is his: his woman and his house. This movie is not for everyone, but should be seen if nothing else for the controversial rape scene, although many would debate as to whether it was a rape or consensual sex.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know quite what to think after viewing Sam Peckinpah's controversial-for-the-day suspense drama 'Straw Dogs'. I kind of liked it, but I was very confused by it. The film starts off a real bore, and then gets a tad interesting about half an hour into it. At the one hour mark it gets consistently entertaining, and the final half-hour of the film is non-stop suspense and thrills. The film is really dull when the first half, and wildly entertaining the second half. Dustin Hoffman gives an astonishing performance as to be expected as the poor Math geek who decides he's not gonna take sh*t from no one anymore, and Susan George is very so-so in her role (she's topless in the film, so that's a plus for all you hound dogs out there). The movie is very brutal and violent in it's final thirty minutes and it contains a very strange and disturbing semi-mutual rape scene towards the middle. This isn't really a film for the weak-stomached, like a lot films of this genre. Sam Peckinpah does a fine job directing, but the screenplay has some major pacing problems and doesn't follow through on a lot of things. I didn't have a clue what to make of the abrupt and confusing ending the film had. I felt it was trying to put across a message, but I have no idea what that message was. In conclusion, 'Straw Dogs' is well worth watching just to see that exhilarating final thirty minutes and to see a very young Dustin Hoffman. Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Social Comment on the 70's Values and Mores of British Lower-Middle Class</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when I was in my teens and decided to watch it again after I heard there has been a remake (which I have chosen not to see--I have always been suspicious of remakes. Ha ha).This movie is basically a social comment on the lower-middle class of Britain (or shall I say of England, since the movie is set in Cornwall, England), how vulgar, primitive, and uncouth the values and mores of average lower middle class there had been in the late 1960' and early 70's, under the veneer of apparent civility. The townspeople including the reverend, taunt the protagonist (played by Hoffman)who is an American, with remarks on the racial tension or the nuclear bombs of the U.S. (insinuating 'moral hazard' and the threat the U.S. posed to the humankind, with the implication that they the British people were morally superior relative to the Americans.) Well, actually the Britishers turn out to be not so morally superior as the plot develops--they murder, rape, steal, cheat and harass people from outside. (The movie had been banned in Britain until 2002. I suspect the supposedly 'controversial' rape scene was not the real agenda for the ban.)Britain has been and is basically a class society, probably even more so than the pre-1917 revolution Russsia. The lower class live vulgar and the 'upper class' live pretending to be not so vulgar--however they are all the same--as Sam Peckinpah portrays the 'reverend.' The English are dangerous people to trust--They are treacherous, under veneer of civility. If you are stranded in a lifeboat with them. They will kill and eat you. Do not trust them just because they sing opera aria.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true, revealing classic brought to you in part by Dustin Hoffman, Susan George and Sam Peckinpah. For viewers like you. Thank you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying Dustin Hoffman and Susan George give their all in Sam Peckinpah's highly controversial and genre-blending classic, Straw Dogs. And Yes, I use the word "classic" in its full context. This movie is a classic; a triumphant voyage into the psyche and limits of manhood; and what entails manhood and its harsh decisions. Intense, dramatic and certainly shocking, Straw Dogs is a film of high merit, in my opinion, because of one thing: relate ability. Dustin isn't some superman punching intergalactic overlords through space rocks to earn the love and respect of his girl. No. He's just the ordinary guy. He's non-confrontational, quiet and pacifistic by the beginning; hoping just to give his wife the best in their new secluded home. The last 20 minutes, however, his true nature is tested through unconventional and truculent situations which endanger his honor; his wife and their "home". The journey to this point is slow, but rewarding as well. The slow build-up not only adds realism and dynamic emotion into the plot; it adds to the shocking and extraordinary finish. And yeah yeah; the movie is highly controversial for its *ahem* sexually exploitative scenes and accused male chauvinism....but honestly, this is all needed. I mean, heck, in no way, am I trying to justify the feminine portrayals/treatments in this film as genuine or politically correct. Because they aren't. However, they are real. And this film, which isn't perfect by any means, is effectively real. And for s digitalized and "mainstream" film, especially according to the films today and in retrospect, that's a mighty accomplishment!P.S. Best Line: Tie between ".......Jesus,......I got 'em all" and "You OK?" (Both lines appear near the end of the film.-Tsuwamono</fullReview>

It deals with mathematician David Sumner (Dustin Hofffman) relocates with his wife (Susan George) to her hometown in a Cornish village . When they return to her ancestral village tensions build between them , a brewing conflict with locals (Ken Hutchison ,Peter Vaughan , Jim Norton , Del Henney) becomes a threat to them both .

It is a very interesting exercise in thriller, human degradation, an example of the conflict between town and country , and between civilization and barbarism . A strong , difficult and frightening picture reaction to the violence and hard times of the 60s . Brutal great movie by Sam Peckinpah in which the wimpy starring finds that primitive savagery exists beneath the most peaceful surface heading an outburst of violence . It is a very entertaining story with a stunning as well as thrilling ending , which magnificent Dustin Hoffman and Susan George . Dustin is very good , though a little too slack at times , and on the ending he stands out . Dustin Hoffman - not usually a fan of violent films - admitted that he only took the role in this movie for the money. Before shooting, Sam Peckinpah instructed Dustin Hoffman and Susan George to live together for two weeks, with screenwriter David Zelag Goodman in tow , some of their interactions during this period were worked into the film's script. Controversially violent 1971 movie, is considered fairly faithful to original novel "The Siege of Trencher's Farm" by Gordon Williams , being well screen-written by the same Sam Peckinpah and David Goodman . The title comes from the Chinese philosopher Lao-tzu, who wrote, "Heaven and earth are not humane, and regard the people as straw dogs, " Straw dogs were used as ceremonial objects for religious sacrifices in ancient China. It is a very violent picture , in fact, because of its graphic portrayal of violence and two brutal rapes, the British Board of Film Censors banned the film from being released on video from 1984 until 2002. The highly charged sequences of carnage in the conclusion make this a controversial movie . Thrilling and appropriate musical score by Jerry Fielding , Peckinpah's usual musician . Evocative and atmospheric cinematography by cameraman John Coquillon . The motion picture was compellingly directed by Sam Peckinpah . He provides striking and well shot images , filled with many moments of visual metaphors and parallel scenes .It was a subsequent remake (2011) of the controversially violent movie, released almost 40 years to the day of the original version, which came out November 3 1971 , it was directed by Rod Lourie with James Marsden , Kate Bosworth , Rhys Coiro, Billy Lush and Alexander Skarsg?rd ; this is a remarkable rehabilitation of a classic film and considered fairly faithful to Sam Peckinpah's original, though the location has been moved from Cornwall , England , to the U.S. Mississippi Gulf Coast, and the hero's profession has been changed from an intellectual mathematician to screenwriter . It does not reach the height of the great Sam Peckinpah film but no doubt that is a remarkable product of good cinema with a violent, bloody , brutal finale as well as the original flick .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Home Watching Straw Dogs proves to be a haunting experience, one where brutal and graphic scenes of violence shock as much as the psychological tension and emotional imbalance presented by all the recurring characters. In a seemingly peaceful village in England horrible incidents occur one after another, and the thin line between good and evil becomes blurry, as the transitions that the characters go through change the way the audiences perceive the whole unnerving intrigue.David Summer (Dustin Hoffman's most sinister role), an American mathematician, moves to the isolated town of Cornish along with his gorgeous, young wife Amy. Shortly after their arrival, all the citizens begin to show their dark natures, harassing and assaulting the two newcomers. In the film's most climatic and disturbing sequence, David decides to fight back against the oppression, and realizes that the only way to fight violence is to do it with even more violence. In a most suggestive manner,Straw Dogs plays with the viewer's imagination, fiercely suggesting that David might actually be the antihero of the movie, and the source of all-evil in himself. His strangely unemotional attitude towards all the horrifying occurrences and ? even more ? towards the tragedy of his wife ironically makes him the antagonist of the film, and sort of a brutal animal that won't stop till he does too much damage.The film became famous for its controversial rape scene, which is by far one of the most unsettling scenes of sexual harassment ever filmed. The bestiality and mockery that permeate the film almost all the time makes Straw Dog an emphatic affair where physical bloodbath must give way to deeply psychological struggles between the id and all its counterparts. Sam Peckinpah created a truly gory and forcible tale about bullying, in which man's worst nightmares suddenly turn into the realizations of his most ferocious ideas and dreams.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dustin Hoffman's finest hour...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Part of that post-Hays Code renaissance of cinema in the sixties and seventies, 'Straw Dogs' is a fantastic portrayal of what happens when man is pushed too far. The man in question is David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman), an American mathematician who moves into a new house in England with wife Amy (Susan George). What starts out as bullying by some of the local hooligans becomes something much more sinister and extreme, forcing David to react in kind.To understand just how disturbing 'Straw Dogs' is, you only need to look at the fact that it was banned in the UK until 2002. It pulls no punches, it really doesn't. Violence and sex are expressed unflinchingly, shot with an unsettling level of detail and intimacy, creating a sense of dread that permeates through the movie. This is easily a precursor to movies like 'Funny Games', which relies on the same intensity.But more than the actual violence itself, it's the slow build to these sequences that are memorable. You could probably class this as a psychological thriller, but I think 'Straw Dogs' is at its heart a character study. David Sumner's evolution is a lesson in character development, and Dustin Hoffman's performance is a lesson in acting. From first scene to last, he is magnetic, stealing every scene he's in. I couldn't really imagine any other actor expressing the nuances and layers of the character the way Hoffman does. Susan George, too, probably gives the best performance of her career, and the chemistry between the two is excellent.There should never have been a remake of this film; really annoys me that there was. No way that the performances of Hoffman and George could be recreated, as could not the unsettling nature of the original. This should be watched at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps it's not really the Sam Peckinpah movie some people expect it to be but it's a real fine movie nonetheless.It's not as violent as other Peckinpah movies (at least not till its final 20 minutes or so) and it's actually being more of a psychological thriller than anything else really. It's also a more of slow moving and subtly build up one, that takes its time to set up its character and to build up all of its tension.But saying this is a psychological thriller doesn't mean it's being a very typical one as well. It's still a movie with its very own style and approach to the genre. It's as if Sam Peckinpah ignored the existence of all of the other genre movies out there and simply decided to do his own thing with it. The result is a real unique looking and feeling genre movie, that is a greatly constructed- and acted out one.The style gets only enhanced by the fact that this is a '70's movie. That means that it's filled with some nice looking and experimental camera-work and editing. It's mostly a dark and gritty looking movie, that perfectly captures the atmosphere of rural England.Because it's being a somewhat slower moving movie, it mostly relies on its characters and actors to keep things going and interesting. And this movie manages well with doing so. What I liked about Dustin Hoffman's performance and character was that he was being a very average guy, in about every way imaginable. And even more than that; he was being somewhat of a weakling and pushover, until things go too far.Like basically every Peckinpah movie, this movie has a big and violent showdown, with still a very humane and emotional touch to it. Lets just say it's like "Home Alone" gone wild, after the main character finally decides to make a stand against the 'evil' townspeople. It's not half as ridicules as it might sound to you and it's something that absolutely works out well, since it's basically the moment the entire movie had been building up to.A greatly done psychological thriller with some rich characters and great depth to it as well. 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American's English girlfriend's home is his castle...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peckinpah's notorious rape and siege film is starting to look a little dated now and the scenes that once made it so controversial look almost tame compared to some of the excess we've been subjected to in the near forty years since it was originally released. Take away that controversy and you're pretty much left with a slow-moving (although not necessarily boring) first half which suddenly becomes an entirely different film for its final reel.Paradoxically, Dustin Hoffman is miscast but gives the film's best performance as David Sumner, a mild-mannered mathematician with an improbably foxy wife in the nubile form of a young Susan George. The couple, whose marriage is clearly on the verge of disintegrating, have moved to a cottage in the Cornish countryside near the village where Amy (George) once lived, and it's not long before an old flame begins sniffing around.The relationship between David and Amy is a problematic one: it's as if these two disparate characters ? one cerebral and thoughtful, the other by turns flighty and moody ? have been thrown together purely for the purposes of the film. They just aren't convincing as a couple in a relationship with (presumably) a substantial past together behind them. Peckinpah also draws his characters with broad strokes ? on the one side are the labourers: virile, violent, heavy-drinking, on the other the thinkers: David, the reverend and the local justice of the peace, and between them lies no middle ground at all. They're like two battle camps cautiously eyeing one another across a field, with absolutely no idea about why they are about to go to war? The women in the film are even more badly drawn. They are either prim types, adjuncts to their male partners with nothing to say, or flirtatious sex-bombs whose fates (death and buggery) are a direct result of their sexual nature.Despite this, Peckinpah fashions quite an effective thriller, especially in the last half-hour. Improbable as David's turnaround is it panders to the lower person in us all who demands revenge ? even if the person meting it out is unaware that he is doing so. David has to revert to a basic savage instinct in order to protect his home, an impulse shared with descendants stretching right back to the caveman, and so to do so he has to become like the men he is fighting against (as, to a degree, does the viewer who is rooting for him to overcome them). It's a ludicrous conclusion, one that completely negates all that we have learned about Sumner, and yet it's still infuriatingly satisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The more that I can relate to a certain character in a film, the more I tend to get into that film and look for truths in the character's feelings, motivations, and actions. And in this film, I can relate to Dustin Hoffman's college math professor David Sumner. This may be Hoffman's greatest overlooked performance. Hoffman's Sumner and his wife Amy, played to sexy, alluring, heartbreaking perfection by British actress Susan George, move to a cottage in her hometown on the English countryside where Hoffman will teach math at a local university. Their home needs extensive renovations, so Hoffman hires some local ne'er-do-wells, and old acquaintances of Amy's, to make the needed repairs. This group of locals unfortunately gets re-acquainted with Amy all too well. They set it up so that one of them takes Sumner out to hunt while the rest of them rape her at the cottage one day. Once he 'finds out' (it is never really established if he knows for sure if it was rape or just sex), initially, he does nothing and even seems to look at Amy as being promiscuous and to have asked for it, since she flirted with these guys earlier on. Also, Sumner is very smallish in stature and fairly weak and wouldn't stand a chance against the bullies in a fight. And all the while, these thugs still hang around and make fun of Sumner and Amy and taunt them throughout the movie, even after their despicable, heinous act. It is at the end of the film that Sumner decides to get tough with these guys and defend his home and wife's honor (although it is very debatable this is the reason why he did this) by not allowing them to kill a mentally impaired man that had just done something bad to one of the gang's relatives.The movie is very shocking in parts and there are a lot of character close-ups that give it a claustrophobic feel. Typical to a Peckinpah film, there are a lot of violent moments, especially at the end, and disgusting characters. The ending scenes are extremely powerful and are some of the most disturbing moments you'll ever see in a film. There are several ironic, unexpected twists at the end.As stated before, I can totally relate to David Sumner, who is a real fish-out-of-water and very ordinary man being mocked and ridiculed by a bunch of thuggish bullies. His motivations for doing what he does at the end may not be completely right or honorable, but it is the act itself, defending his home and what is his, that on the surface appears honorable. The end of the movie is almost open-ended, making you really think about what just happened and did Sumner really do the right thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Straw Dogs" is a powerful film. Powerful both in its graphic violence and the emotion it suggests. It is also a very chaotic film attempting to run several sub-plots parallel with one another.We have, as a central character, a mathematician (Dustin Hoffman) who is timid in nature and seemingly afraid to stand his ground in the face of opposition. Then there is his beautiful young wife (Susan George) who is desperate for his attention, and it is suggested during her rape that she may be sexually unfulfilled. We have the "village idiot" who has committed some act of pedophilia that has the town on edge. Then there is the town drunken bully who it would seem can only be controlled by the town magistrate. We finally have the young, sexually-awakening teen girl who has a crush on Hoffman. All of these "issues" converge with one another in a volatile conclusion."Straw Dogs" is such a perfect example of the 70's dramas like "Looking For Mr. Goodbar", "The French Connection", and even "Marathon Man". Much like the music of Nirvana, they start out relatively mellow and crescendo into a chaotic roar. The problem is that when the credits role, the train fails to stop, and the viewer is propelled into the blackness of uncertainty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cornish Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah's Cornish western has a heritage of controversy trailing in its wake. Perceived by turns as being misogynistic, exploitative, pornographic and gratuitously violent, it was labelled a "video nasty" in the 1980's and was consequently banned from view in the UK until the tail end of the nineties. An intriguing pedigree.Essentially, what we have is a movie that uproots some of the values, morality and themes governing the mythic cinematic western and transplants them into an English backwater community. The locals are restless, being envious of and despising the American strangers (Dustin Hoffman and wife Susan George) who intrude on their redneck world. The fact that Hoffman's wife used to be one of their own serves to make matters worse, increasing both tension and conflict.Hoffman wants to avoid trouble and remain peaceable, but ultimately is pushed too far when his cat is killed, wife is raped and his homestead is laid siege to by his tormentors. He stubbornly offers shelter to Niles, the village idiot, who has just inadvertently killed a young girl. His refusal to surrender the man to the (lynch) mob initiates the violent finale. The stage is set for a man doing what a man's gotta do, and this translates as holding the fort whilst killing and maiming as many of the attacking natives as possible.The controversy surrounding the film stems primarily from the issues of sex and violence. When Amy (Susan George) is raped by one villager she responds ambiguously by first seeming resistant and naturally unwilling to participate and then appearing to enjoy the experience, encouraging her attacker (who is also an ex-boyfriend). This duality of attitude, this ambivalent mixed message towards forced sex upset many a feminist and non-feminist alike at the time and led to accusations of exploitation and misogyny on the part of the director. Compounding the situation is the fact that immediately following this first act of sexual abuse, Peckinpah then has the Amy character anally raped by another villager. Ultimately, her response is to conceal these events from her husband and appear no more than slightly withdrawn, petulant and a bit miffed. Any psychological and emotional trauma or physical discomfort or damage she may have experienced is ignored and unexplored. In fact, if one is honest, Peckinpah actually succeeds in trivialising rape. Events earlier in the film clearly suggest that she "was asking for it anyway." Amy is seen to "tease" the locals by appearing naked at her window whilst they work on her barn roof outside. This monumentally sexist attitude provoked outrage in the early 1970's and no major filmmaker today would be likely to get away with such an approach to the subject matter. Peckinpah argued that it was in fact cuts by the British censor that actually succeeded in making the rape scenes appear more pornographic and less politically correct than his original intent ? but I'm inclined to take this with a pinch of salt.The violence at the end involves a foot being blown off with a shotgun, a beating with a poker, boiling water being thrown into faces and a semi-decapitation with a man-trap. By today's standards, they can hardly be considered gratuitous or graphic in their depiction. However, it is a testament to Peckinpah's skill as a filmmaker and Dustin Hoffman and Susan George's performances that the experience of the siege is both powerful and harrowing. The drunken mob are suitably menacing, mindless, obnoxious and deserving of their fate. It's an exciting end to what is essentially a slow-burning and action-free movie constructed primarily to gradually crank-up the tension until the climax. In this sense the film does not disappoint. Hoffman gives a nervy, slightly-wired, pacifistic almost to the point of cowardice type of performance throughout that contributes magnificently to the build-up. His character finally snaps under pressure from all the insults, goading and abuse he has received from his antagonists. He utilises the provision of a safe-haven for the mentally challenged Niles more as an excuse to exact revenge, to force a confrontation, than to satisfy any moral rationale he may harbour. The stand-off is not even about retribution for the rape of his wife, more an affirmation of his own manhood, standing up to the bully, facing down the bad guys. Typical macho Peckinpah ideology steeped in Western mythology.To conclude, Straw Dogs is a fascinating and essential film by a master craftsman. In technical terms, it builds a sense of suspense and ever-increasing dread in the audience with almost clinical expertise. The climax is nearly as cleverly choreographed as the finale to The Wild Bunch ? only framed by different culture and in different context. If you can ignore the faintly repugnant ideology behind the rape sequence (which probably says more about Peckinpah's personal attitude towards women than anything else) then this is a true 70's classic that even today has the power to shock and enthral.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Straw Dogs is a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has never really been a movie quite like 'Straw Dogs', and it is debatable whether there ever will be again. I say this because I don't think I've ever seen such an intense depiction of violence--sexual and otherwise. The film is uncompromising in this regard. No other filmmaker but Peckinpagh could have made a movie like this. I remember seeing this movie in a movie theater when it was released in 1971 and the only other film that even comes close was 'Deliverance' (ironically, a movie which came out just a year later) and that was for just one scene, i.e., Ned Beatty being raped by a bunch of hillbilly rednecks while deep in the Georgia woods. Susan George is perfectly cast despite being not up to Hoffman's acting abilities; likewise, the rest of the actors are so believable that you forget you are watching a movie.Enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw Straw Dogs I thought it was really sick. But after the second viewing, I realised that the film wasn't actually that bad. It did depict a double rape scene quite graphically and there were some shockingly violent moments (a guy shoots his toe off with a shotgun)but that's about it.The film built up a lot of suspense after a slow start, then went head-first into the violence at the end. The infamous rape seen is what builds the most suspense as you're waiting on edge thinking "is this the scene" as soon as the film starts.Overall, a good thriller that didn't deserve the video nasty status it got given by the critics, however, it is still rather nasty so be warned those easily offended.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK..So for some it would seem Straw Dogs doesn't hit the nerve, and I understand that in someways. After all Straw Dogs is indeed Hofmans least known work..but why? Well the film was banned for many years due to its sexual content and somewhat violent ending. In order to really enjoy this film you have to remove your 21st century brain and place yourself in the context of the early 70s. Watch the film with care and you will see so many tried and tested film making methods that you will soon lose count, but thats the point. Old hat now, but as fresh as a daisy then. Sure the film lacks some of the pace that by methodology we have come to accept as the recognized bench mark for a good movie. But again onto my next point..the film doers not meet the recognized standard but rather creates its own ideal. The pace being weighted to capture the mood.So add all the above up and whats my summary.Straw Dogs was for its time unique and became the setting for so many latter films. The violence in this movie is not only felt from the outside but also the inside. The movie is a one of and unique exploration into human relationships and the powers that make us what we are.</fullReview>

It's slow perhaps in the way Taxi Driver is slow.. ie you can sense a build up of tension, you can sense that something is going to happen. It's very watchable.It's another example of 70s films being far superior to the Hollywood tripe being served up to us at cinemas at present. In a similar way to Deliverance, you can see the character development as the film progresses, and how people can change where circumstances force their hand.I also appreciate the lack of attempted comedy in this film If this film was remade today, no doubt it'd be full of low quality American "humour".

		<fullReview>+++ SPOILERS +++What is it about the infamous rape scene in this movie that is so disturbing and was the reason (I believe) that the film was banned in the UK for so long?Mark Kermode's excellent Channel 4 documentary (UK, 09/08/03) went some way to answering this. It was interesting, but not surprising, that the feminist commentator had the biggest problem with it. The problem really is that it is just too emotionally realistic. This will annoy a lot of people, but it is clear that at some level Amy (Susan George) does enjoy the violation by Charlie. The problem is that this is not a clear cut situation and she is struggling with the complexities of what she is feeling. Perhaps she is getting back at David, perhaps it is a form of self-punishment or simply that she enjoys Charlie's strength over David's passivity. Left at that one might wonder what would have happened between them next, but of course there is more and worse to follow.It is when the second man rapes Amy that things become really disturbing primarily through Charlie's actions in aiding this violation. For a brief moment Charlie is slightly elevated and there is the possibility that he may actually have some feelings for Amy, but we see that his affinity with the yokel gang is stronger and he is reduced to their level completely, losing even that hint of humanity.This says more about the human condition than the audience should be comfortable with and again is chillingly realistic. Think of how rape has been used as a weapon in numerous civil wars, in Vietnam and Central America and of the men who have sat in bars and actually plotted to abduct and abuse women and you get the idea.Susan George acts her heart out and has never been better. Hoffman is excellent as usual (although he bumbles about just a little too much here and there). All the supporting cast are very competent, but especially Peter Vaughan, a much under-rated actor in my book.This is classic film, which really does dare to explore the darkness of the human heart. I doubt if it could be made today in our politically-correct, but ultimately valueless society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must See Controversial '70s Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Spoilers, perhaps****The Straw Dogs is Sam Peckinpah's masterpiece of man's true nature. The movie debates how civilized we really are. It's nature vs. nurture, brain vs. brawn, and city vs. country.An American mathematician (Hoffman) moves in to his wife's (George) family home in rural England to work on his thesis. But instead of finding peace and quiet, he finds a town full of rowdy people who, in their isolated place in the world, behave the way they want to with their own unique moral code.They study Hoffman like an alien--and laugh behind his back at the pub. Hoffman makes the mistake of hiring George's ex-boyfriend and his "pals" to do some repairs on the house. Hoffman soon finds out they have no intention of doing any real work--they are only interested in taking his money and lusting after his wife. Hoffman refuses to confront them on a matter of principle, but you know that he is a coward, and you can identify with it.Some disturbing violent events take place, such as the rape of George. The old pub owner's slutty teen daughter tries to seduce Hoffman, but he declines because he is cerebral, remember; so the girl seduces the town's retarded man, who--reminiscent "Of Mice and Men"--accidentally kills her. Of course, the father and George's ex and his group of thugs go on a manhunt for the retarded man, who Hoffman accidentally hits with his car. He takes the injured man to his home to the dismay of George. George tells her husband that she doesn't want the man in the house, and throughout the movies, she has been antagonistic towards her husband--it's clear she never wanted to come back to this town.Of course, the town's men come banging on the couple's door, demanding that Hoffman give them the retarded man. But Hoffman refuses because he feels like the man is his responsibility. An action-packed siege of the house takes place, and Hoffman is forced to fight to defend his home and wife--and finds that he likes it! Is blood shed sometimes a necessary evil? You be the judge of that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains spoliersI sat down to watch Straw Dogs on an imported American DVD in the knowledge that it contained a controversial rape scene. Apparently, British censors will not allow a home video/DVD release unless the infamous scene is altered. The scene itself is disconcerting but by today's liberal standards I'm not sure that it qualifies as shocking any more. It is, in any case, arguable that Amy (Susan George) is raped, given that it verges on the consensual. It is this ambivalence, however, that gives the scene its impact. Should she be enjoying this? Should I be disgusted? The second sexual act, moments later, is unambiguous. But given that the film is psychologically unnerving throughout, the second (or first, depending on your point of view) rape is less effective filmmaking.In having his lead character David (Dustin Hoffman) leave America for a quieter life in rural England, Peckinpah shrewdly sets the scene for a confrontation between David's expectations and brutal reality. The village in which he lives has a sinister tranquillity, reminiscent of the early scenes in An American Werewolf in London. The first hour is slow but not gratuitously so. The increase in tension between Hoffman and the hired builders, who do their utmost to undermine him, is palpable. Until the bloody denouement, though, David maintains his calm. Peckinpah's exploration of the limits of man's tolerance is undertaken in an intriguingly aggressive style. The viewer is left with much to ponder about the choices David makes in the face of emotional and physical conflict. The film's climax is unflinching, and in the context of envelope-pushing early '70s filmmaking, it has undeniable impact on the viewer, even 30 years on.Hoffman gives a good performance in his predominantly-understated role while Susan George, to the consternation of feminists everywhere, excels as his harrowed yet confused wife. Straw Dogs will never have universal appeal or acclaim but I believe that it deserves to be bracketed with A Clockwork Orange, not just for their shared censure, but also for its brave handling of subjects that remain controversial to this day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Utterly amazing, I had never seen this film until I went to Australia, as it is banned in England. I can see why it must be because of the graphic rape scene and more to the point that the victim enjoys this brutal rape. However I think that the story justifies this scene, there is an obviously a history between herself and the rapist that we are not told in the film, not only that but she obviously desires the excitement that her husband cannot provide. Having said all that I can see why women would find it offensive, but of course we would have to say that the scenario is not totally unrealistic, is it really impossible that a woman could enjoy or fantacize about this scenario ? Plus this women doesn't realise what is going to happen afterwards, she thinks she is only dealing with an old flame. I see this film as a Deliverence set in England and it surprised me that Halliwells film guide gives Deliverence 4 stars but slates this film and says it is ridiculous. I would suggest that, as it is a British book, they are happier with the idea of charicature rednecks in USA than in England. Basically I thought this film was fantastic even though it was very shocking, and it had me thinking about it for days afterwards and I think that if a film can provoke that much thought then it must be worth recommending. I have to say that I think it is an infringement of my rights as a citizen of a free country that I could not legally own this film.</fullReview>

So i got interested,I gotta say the remake is way better. The couple is unconvincing, they are more like two strangers living together. The women seems more in love with her rapists then her husband and she doesn't really care that hes being attacked and barely tries to help him. The first hour feels like its from a separate movie then the last hour. The fact that this movie was banned for a while astounds me. Sure it might've offended some people back in '71, but its far from gruesome. Skip this and watch the remake. Like i said just because its old doesn't make it a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dustin Hoffman at His Best in Peckinpah Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dustin Hoffman and Susan George go to a country lodge in a small village in England for him to think and calculate his mathematical theories (as he is some sort of scientist) in director Sam Peckinpah's classic film about, well, about many things. I could barely scratch the surface on all the underlying messages that Peckinpah is saying about mankind, and especially what it means to be a man. What appears at first to be a disturbing, eerie suspense film to the viewer begins to symbolize the different aspects of a man and what he called to be and do in society. At first, its pace is very deliberate, making some wonder when something is going to happen. But you don't have to wait long, as there is an early innocent victim.It's painfully obvious to the viewer through their fights that Dustin and Susan aren't really suited to each other, as she doesn't really understand him and isn't very patient with his peculiar disposition. What's confusing to me is just why there is construction on a second building just beside them all this time that they are in the other one. Basically, the plot in the beginning revolves around the construction workers ogling Susan. Eventually Dustin becomes slowly aware that one of them is playing with their minds in little ways, and that something is really wrong.The last 45 minutes or hour of the movie is like nothing you've seen as she raped by one of the men, of whom she begins to feel more real lust and life coming from him than she felt from Dustin and the viewer is led to the conclusion she feels a certain closeness to him, just from the physical love she is experiencing maybe for the first time. She even calls him by name at the wrong time later on in the movie, which makes Dustin aware of something not right. But he's never told about the rape.Then, there's a subplot about a guy who's not all there, hanging out with teenage girls. When a secret rendezvous goes bad, he runs off and in the middle of a country road, where Dustin hits him with his car in the nighttime fog. He takes him home with him, which causes a violent, non-stop climax whose intensity rivals that of any movie today, when the young girl's father wants the disturbed boy and won't leave without him. Dustin defends his home at all costs. And then and only then, does Susan know just how much she means to him.Never heard of "Straw Dogs"! Well, now you know. It's essential Dustin Hoffman viewing. Interesting title, too! What may appear as something flimsy really is strong after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Buying cigarettes in a pub, David Sumner sees his wife Amy accosted by a former boyfriend. Does he run outside and rip the guy's ears off? Or does he take her cue and play it off as if nothing happened?Answer two is the wrong one, apparently, if you are director Sam Peckinpah and the subject is marriage. "Straw Dogs" is the director's most problematic problem film, not because it's bad but because it's good, just very confusing, and in my view anyway, confused.Dustin Hoffman and Susan George star as the couple, trying to establish themselves in her old Cornish hometown so he can pursue his career as a mathematician in relative peace. The film is replete with references to the violence of the times, Vietnam and street riots."See anybody get knifed?" he is asked by a rat-catching creep named Cawsey (Jim Norton)."Just between commercials," David replies.Of course, violence is never too far from the surface in a Peckinpah movie, especially here with a beautiful woman who likes pushing buttons and is a little put out by her weeny spouse. Using the primitivist vernacular Peckinpah worked from here, David's hunter-gatherer skills are found to be too much gatherer, not enough hunter. Susan craves a firmness he lacks, especially when Cawsey and the other creeps rebuilding a garage on the Sumners' farm are the likely suspects for a particularly nasty B&amp;E. You see Amy's point when she calls David a "coward", but it's hard to like her, even with George giving the film's best performance."You're an animal," David jokes several times to his wife, but to Amy it's no joke but an accurate observation. If he wants to keep her, the film seems to say, he better get animal, too.Is Peckinpah making a "fascist film", as New Yorker critic Pauline Kael once famously observed? I think he's making a confused one. He wants to indict the culture of violence the Sumners spring from, but makes David a fence-sitter rather than an activist when it comes to the big issues of the day. Amy eventually is victimized by the creeps, but there's a degree of culpability on her part that's less ambiguous than it is frustratingly ill-resolved.There's bravado Sam moments all the same. The final fight at the farm, where both David and his attackers revert to their animal origins in a fight to the death, is riveting, and even more so is a preliminary sequence held at a local church where nothing much happens but Peckinpah the control artist keeps you glued to every snigger and stare.Peckinpah claimed later that David is the film's villain, which the commentator on the Criterion DVD I watched took great pains to affirm. I don't see it. David's patronizing, and a bit smug, but not taking his side in the last thirty minutes of the film is more than a bit perverse.Ambiguity is the rule here, though; it's hard being definitive about anything where "Straw Dogs" is concerned. The final scene pits David against the creeps, both using deadly violence for a cause that on both ends we know to be rather flawed. Not that I didn't root for David all the same; Hoffman may not be as interesting as George in this film but he's a compelling underdog.The film works terrifically at building tension, far more so than at relieving it. It's not Peckinpah's best, or even one of his best, but it's a good, atypical film from the heart of his most productive period, utilizing a new cinematographer, new composer, new locale (not North America, for the first and next-to-last time), and new editors, who obviously helped him create some killer sequences. Peckinpah films usually reused familiar actors from his other films, but "Straw Dogs" only has one who appeared in a film made before or after: David Warner, who plays Henry Niles the village idiot.No question Peckinpah had his hang-ups with women, and in "Straw Dogs" he lets them all hang out. It's a flawed film for that, yet Peckinpah creates a film that grabs you and doesn't let go. It's not a film that hangs together all that well, but it stays with you long after the credits roll, a sign of a true artist at work, even if he doesn't know quite where he's going.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film when too young to have seen it legally (sneaked into the cinema with a few school-friends when we ought to have looked a lot more like we really were at least 18). It shocked me with its brutal intensity and strange realism. The cinemas in those days still showed double bills, and this was on with Soldier Blue, which was just as brutal or more so, but a lot less subtle - believe it or not - and had a much more impressive body-count at the end.So the night out was a real gore-fest, and not the occasion for a first date. Not surprisingly, there was never a second date with that same girl. At least, that's how I've always explained it to myself.Although I enjoyed Straw Dogs, I was not entirely sure how to react to it, and I thought about the film for a long time afterwards. Recently I watched it again on DVD, for the first time in nearly 30 years. It still has the power to startle, if not to shock by today's standards, perhaps. And it's still a good, memorable film.Anybody connected with the Cornwall tourist industry probably wouldn't like the way their part of the world is depicted, but anyone else with a broad mind should give this film a try. It's worth watching just for Susan George's pouting, sultry beauty. Shame she never made many (any?) other equally enduring films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An important part of movie history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a Cornish village a mild mannered and seemingly eccentric mathematician called David Sumner (Hoffman) is subjected to harassment and bullying by the narrow minded locals who raped his wife Amy (George). Pushed to breaking point he takes a violent revenge to defend his home.STRAW DOGS is based on a novel called THE SIEGE AT TRENCHER'S FARM by Gordon Williams. The director Sam Peckinpah never explained to the audience what the new title meant but the press informed everyone that it was taken from a Chinese proverb. The picture was extremely controversial at the time because of it's violence and the notorious rape scene which was depicted as if Amy was asking for it. As a result the film was banned for nearly twenty years when it was denied a video release under the 1984 Video Recordings Act. It has now received a DVD release in it's uncut version.STRAW DOGS is a violent film and the rape scene is unpleasant, but far worse violence has been unleashed on to our cinema screens in recent years, but having said that I still wouldn't want my eight year old son watching it. The level of acceptable violence and sexuality depicted on screen was far less lax back in 1971 (that's thirty-three years ago!). Viewing the film today one can understand the controversy that the picture caused when one thinks back to the way the world was all those years ago. As a film STRAW DOGS is an important moment of movie history in these respects and as a film it has it's delights. Dustin Hoffman is excellent as the mild mathematician pushed to the limit and Susan George is good as his wife. Sam Peckinpah assembled a first rate British crew to make this film. The supporting cast features many versatile British actors including Peter Vaughan, David Warner, Colin Welland and Peter Arne and the cinematography of John (Witchfinder General) Coquillon is absolutely stunning. He makes superb use of the west of England locations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peckinpah crosses into horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having strongly altered the western film genre with his first five movies, the notorious Sam Peckinpah struck out on new territory. STRAW DOGS was his first film in a contemporary setting, the first to be shot somewhere other than North America, and, arguably, his first and only foray into the horror genre (though BRING ME THE HEAD OF ALFREDO GARCIA has elements of horror in it too).The film's horror is primarily sociological and psychological. Dustin Hoffman portrays an American mathematician on sabbatical in the Cornwall region of England with his British-born wife (Susan George). Ostensibly, he is here to continue his studies in peace; in reality, however, he has come to escape the campus unrest in America caused by the Vietnam war. But he won't find a whole lot of peace even in rural England, as the five workmen he has hired to work on his house have now started a campaign of painful humiliation.The first incident involves George's pet cat getting strangled (very horrible). The second involves the men, led by Del Henney, leading Hoffman out to the moor on a duck hunt--and then having Henney and a second man (Ken Hutchison) brutally rape George; this scene spawned the film's biggest firestorm, because many critics thought George enjoyed the rape. This, however, is not something I believe was the case. In any event, none of these horrific events causes Hoffman to do anything (and George doesn't even tell him about the rape).But when Hoffman takes in a mentally incapacitated man (David Warner) who he accidentally ran into in the fog, things change. For Warner is being sought by the local town drunk (Peter Vaughan) for molesting his daughter, however unwittingly. When Vaughan and the workmen show up at Hoffman's isolated farmhouse demanding that he hand Warner over to them, Hoffman refuses. The result is a nightmarish siege, punctuated by screams, shotgun blasts, and spurting blood, as Hoffman decimates all of his enemies. The coda, in which he and Warner drive off in the fog, is chilling and ambiguous.STRAW DOGS is not an easy movie to like, because Peckinpah's ideas about Man's violent nature are far too realistic and uncomfortable, even for today's gruesome standards. Still, this is a shocking masterpiece, especially due to the fine and ominous cinematography of John Coquillon, who lensed a number of low-budget British horror movies of the time (including THE WITCHFINDER GENERAL), and an excellent, Stravinsky-influenced music score by Jerry Fielding. Just on those two counts alone, STRAW DOGS qualifies as a horror film with a stunning subtext to match.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unfortunate collection of caricatures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A collection of caricatures go through the motions of a terrible script, phoning in even the most dramatic moments, spoiling an exciting premise. I'm not even referring to the Cornwall yokels here, who are at least amusing; it's the two main characters who end up being the greatest let-downs, along with the simplistic morality play of a story itself. To its credit, the film is gorgeous, full of beautiful countryside and rustic town, but that can hardly carry two hours of melodrama.Dustin Hoffman plays a perfect effete professor stereotype, a self-centered coward smugly certain of his superiority, and due to that, the near-instant switch into unbeatable gladiator makes little sense. An explosion of rage and dishing out a few good hits before going down, perhaps. This is no Falling Down, where someone on the verge of cracking for a long time finally does; this is someone who becomes savage against his nature, and somehow conjures the skill to kill every enemy. A male superhero fantasy.Susan George is competent as a petulant brat, always needing attention, pushy yet unwilling to take personal action; the nature of their relationship or why they left is never explained, but it's hinted to be teacher/student. Unfortunately, her character never really goes anywhere, and her acting never gives any nuance to even the charged, violent scene preceding the rape. The only time she seems convincing is in the bedroom scene following David's return.The bizarre direction of the rape, that quiet tenderness suggesting that the first wasn't really rape after all, that deep down an attention-seeking girl is really looking for masculine violence from her paramour that she isn't getting from her husband, really confuses me... almost a rape fantasy. And then the whole purpose of the rape is just to create some extra justification for killing the louts, along with audience titillation. In 1971, it may have been shocking to put an on-screen rape in a mainstream movie, kicking off Last House on the Left and a whole series of rape-revenge movies, but now it just looks exploitative and badly done.Rounding out the cast, there's a few louts, an affable retired army major, a teen temptress, her drunken old father, and a retarded pedophile. Their names are hardly important, because all they do is fill a role.Beyond that, no action in the film looks real. The hits don't look real. The deaths don't look real. The rape doesn't look real.Overall, there's nothing in here but a generic western, uprooted and moved to Scotland, and any nuance the story could have had is missing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this movie I was not the same person I used to be, yup this movie definitely put some impact on you really you can not resist its influence. One of the best work of Sam Peckinpah this movie deals with the true humanitarian phenomena, human nature for sexual orientation and needs and the most human seduction and temptation. This movie thrills you from the start to the end and the most magnificent aspect of the movie is its ambiguity and confusing nature of climax .Its truly nail biting and mind teasing movie .Dustin Hoffman portrayal of cowardice stricken husband was the most disturbing character ever played by any actor and the character of his stubborn, childish wife Amy was also performed outstandingly well by Susan George.The most prolific part of this movie is its climax and its so confusing that even I cant make my mind clear (whether Amy reveals completely about her rape and does Hoffman leaves her at the end) In the end this movie deals with human psyche at its level best and its must seen movie at least for Sam Peckinpah fans</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was the Straw Dogs DVD banned in the UK?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A number of contributors suggest that Straw dogs was banned in the UK. This is a little misleading - I certainly saw it in a cinema soon after it was released (Clockwork Orange was also not refused a certificate - it was withdrawn by Kubrick). Page 61 of the 2002 annual report of the British Board of Film Classification (http://www.bbfc.co.uk/downloads/ files/BBFC_AnnualReport_2002.pdf) points out that the film was passed uncut in 1971 for cinema showings in the UK. A DVD version was refused a certificate in 1999, but the version submitted was one in which cuts had been made for the US market. The cuts were deemed to distort the impact of the rape scene. When an uncut version was submitted with all the rape scene it was passed in full in 2002.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A momentarily beguiling, more often numbly disturbing film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert First aired on British television but weeks ago, "Straw Dogs" is a distinctly odd and uneasy film. Peckinpah is a considerable 'name director' and I gather is one of the most impressive and complex explorers of the Western genre. "Straw Dogs" certainly reflects his interest in depicting violence. Crucially however, the setting is alien to Peckinpah; distant Britain in a presumably fictionalised Cornish locale.I'm not too surprised that one of the said reasons for this film's ban was the pressure of the Cornish tourist board; a well-trodden path of shrill giggles, sinister glances and bullish swaggering is traversed by the locals. Of course, they resemble in the later stages, a mob, breaking into Hoffman's house. What so disturbs in this film is the sense that we seem meant to applaud David's improvised, horrific violence. While we can sympathise with this mild-mannered, slightly beleaguered character earlier in the film, the precise mania of the closing section seems entirely alien. Defending his household (and an unwitting murderer ensconced inside) is raised to an abstract ideal. David's very manhood is confirmed, Peckinpah seems to assert. But how hollow it all is, with Hoffman's unpatterned performance in the later stages. There seems to be little communication between director and actor as to how to play the part.This leads into another intensely problematic area of the film; the portrayal of the sole substantial female role; Amy, as played by Susan George. That David obtains a victory at the close that asserts violent masculine dominance of the household would matter much more if we could really care about and understand Amy. But indeed, we cannot; her reactions to the respective rapes are decidedly jarring and unexplained. The qualitative 'difference' between the two transgressions bemuses and possibly appals. Peckinpah's portrayal of George's character seems lacking in empathy; she is seen as bringing it all on herself, with her minxish, provocative behaviour. Yet, there are minor attempts early on to make her seem an intelligent, sympathetic girl. At times you feel for her (the church gathering where she seems to be experiencing trauma), but you cannot understand things such as her relation to the villagers or her feelings about the rapes. Susan George tries very hard, but is left adrift by Peckinpah's sheer disinterest in her character; there are only scant clues as to her motivation and feelings, most of the time. What a missed opportunity it is that she isn't set against her husband as a model of anti-violence. But Peckinpah does not seem interesting in making anything like a coherent comment on the violent events.Viewed dispassionately, the film is pretty well made; there is quite an effective visual sense of setting in the house and the surrounding countryside. The image of Peter Vaughan in his scotch-soaked beard and bulk impresses itself on the mind, even if the character is a cipher. The early playfulness of Susan George pulling faces and playing chess charms, and we can accept her impudent pouting as part of her character. It is a shame that from a certain point onwards (her reaction to the first rape) we are completely distanced from understanding her; Amy becomes an all-o'er-the-place pawn for various bits of action. There are certainly some beautiful shots of Hoffman watching events in a street, quite early in the film, taking in shop fronts and tottering villagers. Whilst David Warner and T.P. McKenna are entirely ill-served, an amusing and characterful turn slips under the net in the form of Colin Welland's hapless, slightly absurd showman vicar. It must be admitted, also, that Peckinpah creates a powerful effect with the build-up to the rape, with the image fracturing starkly as the villager strikes Amy. This hits the harder and moves far more than the more 'set-piece' finale with Hoffman's character 'defending his home'/committing brutish murders. It is inexplicable that the initial rape is very possibly enjoyed by Amy, after the sinister, harrowing lead-up to it, emphasised by the fractured shot.Obviously, "Straw Dogs" is an inauthentic film, with little sense of naturalism in the setting, and must be taken as such. But, it is surely a shame that Peckinpah couldn't draw a bit more from the Cornish locale, and particularly his characters. There seems to be little real interest for him than an exploration of the means and carnage of the violence. So, a decidedly curious and questionable film, but it certainly should not be obscured from public view. Although, hopefully, few will draw any negative conclusions about life in distant outposts of the British Isles, or approve of the neolithic view of women and tacit support for vigilante violence.</fullReview>

After three decades worth of revenge films that drew inspiration from it, Straw Dogs is merely a well acted and well filmed suspense movie. The fact that the film is relentlessly misogynistic and paints the rural English as addled yokels doesn't help matters. Worth seeing, but you'll probably be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unpleasant classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Sam Peckinpah never really was known for the subtlety or charitably in his films, but he has really surpassed himself with the cruelty "Straw Dogs". This is an ultimately rude and rancorous film and, even though I'm entirely against the banning of movies in general, it truly isn't suitable viewing for certain types of audiences. The graphic violence and disturbing atmosphere didn't bother me at all. Lord knows I'm all pro-violence, but in this particular movie it's really difficult to accept how the violence is glorified! Starting random fights, carrying around shotguns, assaulting other men's wives and taking the law in your own hands?all these awry things are portrayed like they're something you have to do in order to become a REAL man. The absolute height of this wrongful illustration unquestionable is the despicable rape-sequence halfway in the film. Feminists and women-organizations made so many efforts to enfeeble the whole myth, and yet Peckinpah shoots the sequence like it's the ultimate fantasy of every man: she timidly says "no" and gives her attacker a couple of weak slaps in the face, but she clearly means "yes" and she even enjoys the rough hands and sweat-stinking body of a true macho. Many 70's movies handled about rape &amp; revenge ("Last House on the Left", "Deliverance", "I Spit on your Grave", "A Clockwork Orange"?), but "Straw Dogs" is the only one of the bunch that approaches the themes as completely impeccable subjects. David and Amy Sumner are initially introduced as introvert and more educated people, but apparently this isn't good enough for Sam Peckinpah! Real males drink, fight, work with their hands and dominate females. Killing everyone who perpetrates his property at the end of the movie looks almost like a reward for David; a sign of manhood. Disgusting! Does all this mean that "Straw Dogs" is a bad movie and/or unworthy of his classic reputation? Well, the answer is no and that's the tricky part! No matter how much I'd like to warn people NOT to watch it, I can't deny that it's a very well made film and compelling film. The build up towards the inevitably violent climax is truly fascinating. Our young couple initially encounters antipathetic behavior of the Cornish community, then hostility and only then pure inhumanity. Our controversial director masterfully illustrates these switches in tone by simple sound and editing-tricks. The scene where Amy is raped, for example, gets constantly interfered by images of David walking home from hunting, totally unaware that he was lured out of his house. Also undeniable is the influence "Straw Dogs" had on future controversial cinema. This film is completely aware of its controversy but doesn't give a damn whether or not people have moral issues it. This in-your-face attitude somewhat became a standard rule in later cult films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most realistic portrayals of emotion on film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early 2000s, there was a breakout of movies labeled as "torture porn", which all had three main factors. First, they were intended to make the audience feel the same utter desperation as the tortured characters on screen. Second, they almost always had a deep social portrayal. And, third, they were always rejected by hypocritical critics who failed to see intelligence in desperation, then went off and praised hollow "fine cinema" pieces for "saying something about the human condition". These types of films have always interested me because they mix unrelenting pace with a non-genetic message about how humans tend to think. And I find it interesting that Straw Dogs (1971), while not really a "torture" film, has every single aspect I just listed. While it's gained a lot more credit today, in its time, it was just as hated by the critics as "torture porn" is now. It's funny how easily society can completely be in denial when a movie like Straw Dogs says something about the human condition no one will dare say, while society can then go and praise some completely hollow, cliché-spewing film like (excuse the modern example) No Country for Old Men. I find that hypocrisy almost comical. And I think, maybe, that was one of Straw Dog's points.So what makes Straw Dogs so intelligent? Well, first, it is simply one of the few accurate portrayals of REAL human emotion in cinema. Realism is a word that is thrown around constantly by writers/directors, but as Hollywood gets closer to what it thinks is realism, it just takes five steps back from being truly anything like how real humans think. Very few movies have ever achieved truly expressing how people interact without turning the characters into some podium to preach some idea the writer/director has, or just turning the characters into pieces of cardboard that move the plot along. Contrary to popular belief, the greatest acting in the world can't fix unrealistic characters. That works just about as much as a pretty coat of paint fixes a house that's ready to collapse in on itself. The emotion is Straw Dog's shining point. The two main characters' emotions are portrayed differently in every situation. One scene will end with a loving moment, then the next will open with a bitter one, then the next will open with completely indifference. Things that should have an emotional impact on the characters doesn't have any whatsoever. Actions that should cause them negative emotion cause them pleasure. Just when you find a character totally likable, they'll do something to ruin that feeling?a lot like the betrayal of a friend. Put simply: I've seen countless movies in my life, but never once have I seen a movie with this much of a realistic emotional core.Likewise, without spoiling anything, Straw Dogs goes where no movie in its time dared to go with its subject matter. While I wouldn't necessary call every idea presented here original, some of them are, and not a single one of them is a cliché. It's very relatable to A Clockwork Orange?which came out the same year?in that way. I find it sad, however, that A Clockwork Orange is now considered some sort of classic, while Straw Dogs is still lesser known to the general public than a lot of foreign indie films. Straw Dogs nearly singlehandedly formed the groundwork for the thriller genre, and its influence can be seen in everything from other 70s movies to whatever cliché thriller is playing at the local theater as I type this. The ending is pure intensity, and very few movies can pull that off. The kills in the end of the film are a lot more graphic than anything I expected from a 70s film, and some are just brutal. Straw Dogs deserves more recognition.So, if my review is entirely positive, why do I not give this a higher score? As much as I can relate to this movie, and as much as I appreciate it, I think giving this a perfect score is an insult to what the director was going for. Sam Peckinpah didn't want this film to be entertaining; he wanted it to truly disturb the viewer. Though that may be a little hard to do now in 2009, due to the countless rip-offs and rehashes of the subject matter, this is nowhere near easy viewing. Perfection is an extension of contentment, and I personally was not content with this movie. I wasn't supposed to be. It's a point-blank contradiction to the Hollywood formula that states you have to make the viewer go in their pants out of awe/contentment or you haven't done your job. That's why I can't give Straw Dogs a perfect score, but it didn't want one. It's too honest for that. It's too intelligent for that.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Straw Dogs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1971 Sam Peckinpah made the bitter, internally aggressive film Straw Dogs. Starring Dustin Hoffman and Susan George, Peckinpah injected such harsh realism in Straw Dogs which tells the story of a young couple who moved to England to avoid the violence becoming common in America. Isolation and class struggles are the driving issues in Straw Dogs and Peckinpah explores such issues thoroughly and with ease.David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman) and his wife Amy (Susan George) are settling into their new home in Amy's native England. Fearing that America had grown too violent, pacifist David seeks to retreat to a more peaceful community. Quickly noticing many divisions in the area, the drunks/sober people, upper/lower class, David realizes idyllic England may not be as peaceful as he thought it would be. Being an astrophysicist, David enjoys a certain wealth and status that those working on his house do not. The more he is exposed to the stark class differences, the more David realizes how different England is than he thought. When a series of strange events happen in and around David and Amy's house, they both begin to believe the impoverished workers repairing their home are to blame. When David attempts to learn more about the workers and goes duck hunting with them, Amy, left home alone, is raped by two of the men. What next ensues is a violent brawl between David attempting to protect his wife and his home against the attack of the hostile men on the outside. Peckinpah spares no expense exposing the violence that surrounds everyday life, and that so often presents itself in the class conflicts that absorb life. Such elements are crucial to explore, and Peckinpah leaves no stone unturned in his raw exploration of isolation and class struggles. As effective as this exploration proves, it falls short with the casting of Dustin Hoffman. I just don't buy him as a leading actor in any capacity ever. He comes off so one-dimensional, especially in this film. We need a somewhat quiet and unassuming lead actor, but Hoffman is not the actor. The movie was paced very slowly and becomes difficult to engage with. With no likable characters anywhere within the film, the slow pacing makes it even more difficult to engage in. A better film with the same bitter personal deterioration is Joel Schumacher's 1993 film Falling Down, starring Michael Douglas. Likewise, there are no likable characters to attach to in that film either, but it is paced well enough to become engaged in watching the story unfold. I recognize the importance of Peckinpah's Straw Dogs, but it struggles with poor pacing and Dustin Hoffman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Provocative but deeply flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can't say that I'm a fan, but I wouldn't argue that "Straw Dogs" is a poorly made movie by any stretch - the acting is solid and the craft is effective, sometimes brutally so. Personally, the draw was seeing Dustin Hoffman go from massive wimp to a man of action with a fortress to defend. But his character was the weakest aspect of the movie for me (no pun intended).From almost minute one, we want this guy to stand up for himself, in some capacity. I mean, it's obvious to everybody that the tormentors working on his garage are the ones behind his cat's murder. Surely the quiet English countryside has a constable the crime can be reported to. Said lawman would also be ideal recourse after they violently assault his wife. But it's when they want to invade this house that he suddenly goes on the offensive? And it's a rental!There's plenty of controversial subject matter offered here - the rape scene is cause enough - but it's the contrived steps that lead to Hoffman's sudden transformation that turned me off. The bad guys aren't barging in because they want to rob him of his wife or his manhood - they want the town idiot/accidental murderer that's resting in the house. It's just a confluence of events that brings about the mental change. And from then on, he's unbalanced fascist. I was hoping there'd be some sort of catharsis after his rage-fueled campaign, but there's just nothing there. It wouldn't be so bad if the movie didn't hinge on his character, but that guy just does not do anything for me.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looking back at Straw Dogs a film that was never shown on UK television for several decades, you get to see how influential it is. Without this movie there would had never been Home Alone!Director Sam Peckinpah might had been contemplating the brutality of the Vietnam war, the rising tide of violence generally in the 1960s counter-culture or just the inherent brutality of man especially when an outsider appears with a local girl.Dustin Hoffman is a mild mannered American university maths professor who have moved into a farmhouse in rural Cornwall where his wife grew up. His wife (Susan George) is flirty, younger and provocatively dressed at times which arouses desires from her ex boyfriend (Del Henney.)The locals are hired to repair the farm house but soon tease the couple, Del Henney takes advantage of George by forcing himself on her and soon she is also raped by one of his friends.When a simpleton local (David Warner) is accused of abducting a girl from the village and ends being protected by Hoffman in his house, the band of locals descend on them and terrorise them. Hoffman realises he needs to fight back in order to protect his wife and Warner.A lot has been said about this movie, the inbred locals, the brutal rape where the victim might have enjoyed part of it, the level of violence.It now looks rather dated, it is a slow burn film, you know where it is going and there is the explosion of violence in the last act with Peckinpah even adding some black humour as two of the thugs chasing each other in kids bicycles. The plot is actually thin and the film felt plodding to me. Hoffman's character seemed to want to integrate with the thuggish locals, maybe to prove he can mix it with the Alpha males, although you have to question how did he end up marrying someone flighty like George who even when the house is under attack wants to runaway from Hoffman who rightly suspects that she will be killed.The film has a curiosity value but I felt that it would not had been highly regarded but for its reputation and banned from a video release for so long by the British censor.</fullReview>

Her ex-boyfriend Charlie Venner is still interested. Charlie's friends are hired to repair the buildings. Their constant meddling start causing problems within the marriage.There's nobody to really root for in this movie. David and Amy start out as a happily married couple but for some unknown reasons, they start fighting. Out of the blue, she's flashing her boobs for the workers and he's coldly distant. Neither of them are that appealing. The connection drawn by Sam Peckinpah between violence and manhood could have been an interesting idea but this couple is really problematic. This movie is infamous for its violence and its rape scene. Amy's wandering eye really complicates matters, even the rape scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never saw a film so simple and yet so complex at the same time. This is how sophisticated Sam Peckinpah was as director of Straw Dogs. He must have had a god-like understanding of human beings and their vulnerabilities, or Straw Dogs would have turned out a forgettable made-for-TV movie. On the contrary, the film is increasingly relevant to mankind as time goes by, surpassing even a classic branding. The story plot and the script are exceptionally well-done, as it rids the viewers of any disbelief from early on. You stop asking why they move there, why Amy Sumner chooses to conduct herself that way, why there is tension between her and the husband. Why the rape is emotionally mixed between yearning and disgust on her part, and all the rest. You subscribe to the film from the beginning, and helplessly follow them every step of the way until every bit of emotion is brutally unfolded and till tail lights of that white car disappears into the darkness. If you show this 1971 film around the US today, it would be easily alleged of campaigning for the National Rifles Association to support the rights to bear arms. It is scary to discover that violence does not have to start from your own inclination or their provocation. Violence can be a result of mutual contempt without you being conscious of helping to develop one. In this film, violence is much a combination of David, Amy, Charlie, Chris, Norman, Henry, Tom, Reverend Barney Hood, to even the lawman Major John Scott, who represents a mindset of "the law is dead". Sam Peckinpah, as this film was first released, was condemned almost unanimously by critics and viewers alike. He was accused of glorifying violence, in support of a lawless society, and in favor of Doomsday's analogies. Today we see him as a prophet who was and is wise. His analysis of social problems is second to none. You can even restructure all governments' crime-preventing policy based upon his films, particularly on this one. Someone made the right call not to try any sequels of this film. The reason is obvious: we now become the real-life sequel of David Sumner's driving Henry Niles into the dark on that fateful night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peckinpah at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After courting controversy with the bloody western The Wild Bunch in 1969, filmmaker Sam Peckinpah would push the envelope of on screen violence even further with his 1971 follow up film Straw Dogs. The story of a timid mathematician who turns into a blood thirsty killer after a group of hoodlums rape his wife and attack his home, the film remains a visceral and disturbing watch some 45 years after its original release.Straw Dogs follows mathematician David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman) and his attractive young wife Amy (Susan George) as they settle in Amy's quiet childhood village in Cornwall so that David can devote time to his work. Markedly different within the town's milieu, the Sumner's presence causes dissension among the townspeople with a gang of local hoodlums beginning to bully Sumner and lust after his wife.The situation escalates when one of the lead hoodlums rapes Amy, setting the stage for the film's second half where David finally sets aside his "nice guy" facade in order to savagely reassert his masculine pride.Violent and unrelenting, Straw Dogs is a meditation on man's base savagery from one of cinema's most terminally politically incorrect auteurs. Whether one finds themselves loving or hating Peckinpah's polarizing vision, however, Straw Dogs is certainly not a film to leave you indifferent, a testament to its enduring power so many years after its initial release.</fullReview>

Very memorable though.In film school I did an essay on an aspect of films regarding how often female characters are used as plot obstacles for the males to overcome in order to advance the story. Here this is happening, yet it goes further in that her suffering becomes a big part of the story along side her carrying out so many ultimately destructive actions. There are also many male characters that perform many destructive actions here. I recommend this if you appreciate solid character development.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review for the original in 1971 and the remake in 2011</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I will start with reviewing the original. I really liked Dustin Hoffman for this movie, he was probably the perfect pick to play that type of character. As for the other actors they're picked decently. I like the setting in Britain. But as everyone knows the film doesn't get good until the payoff, after all of that buildup you come to the showdown. I think it played out great and left its mark.Now I will review the remake. I'm kind of stuck between the 2 films but Im pretty sure I prefer this one. All the actors suited there roles great and played them very well. Unlike the original this one made its message and made it with one hell of a showdown. James Marsden isn't Dustin Hoffman but that is a minor problem.To sum up the two reviews I don't see how the original has a 7.6/10 when the remake has a 5.8/10, it just doesn't make sense. These two films were damn near equal. Both had aspects that they didn't share with the other. If you were to pick which one to watch from the two then pick the remake. It's characters are much better established, faster paced, soundtrack, and the showdown was cooler to. Close call but in this case I think the classic isn't as good as the remake.In conclusion, I can easily see how some preferred the original but both films are so close to each other I don't see how the two films could receive completely different ratings. But do the remake being modern the film overall is done less gritty and with more style. Watch the two films and give your own opinion. Thanks for reading my review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peckinpah at his Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those Seventies classics that, once you watch it you never ever forget about it. Peckinpah made some classics in his time from The Wild Bunch to Cross of Iron, but this one is my personal favourite. Absolutely brilliant film making from start to finish and a lesson to others on how to make 'proper' films.Why they would even consider doing a modern day remake just proves how absurd and out of touch Hollywood has become. This version is the real deal, no doubt about it.Peckinpah builds the suspense from the moment you see Amy wandering through town without a bra, and continues to build it slowly but gradually throughout, leading to the infamous explosive ending. There's all kinds of themes going on regarding relationships, manhood, masculinity, town vs city, existentialism - the usual Peckinpah ingredients.He holds the lid on the pressure cooker boiling in front of us, adding layer upon layer of suspense and characterisations, and slowly releases it at 1 hour. Then lets go with a BANG!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish and Disturbing....'70's and Sam Peckinpah still have their charm intact and luminous all the more....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah and his violent dogs are out to create mayhem. Straw dogs is surely a very challenging film, both as a creator and similarly so as a viewer. It makes you quite uncomfortable to begin with, teases you and a sort of guilty pleasure finds its way into the viewer. Like the protagonist, the viewer too finds himself in a very hard and rustic environment. Now Sam Peckinpah has been labeled a misogynist over the years and considering the kind of shots he uses in the beginning it doesn't quite refute his reputation. Straw dogs pulls of the disturbing act finely, the editing and juxtaposition of violent montages between the regular chorus of things agitates the viewer as much it does so to the characters. The violence is stylistic, specially as we are drawn to the climax the amalgamation of stylistic violence together with the soundtrack creates an ambiance so intriguing that you find your eyes glued to the screen. The entire climax is dark, disturbing and perfectly executed. As for the much debated sexually explicit scene, it is alarming and at the same time confusing. The entire plethora of emotions radiated by Susan George through out the scene never quite lets the viewer settle in on a conclusion of an emotion of his own. Rage, Guilt, Agony and a whole lot of emotion rush in and the editing adds to the discomfort all the more. As for performances, it was a fair show. The leads Susan and Dustin do a fine job. Dustin in fact fits right into it, a marvelous all round acting display. The transition displayed towards the climate required a subtle precision that only an actor of Dustin s caliber could have pulled off and this is precisely what he does. Rest of the cast do a fine job as well. Though one flaw of the movie was the plot line around David Warner s character, Henry. It was a very flat character to start with, not much time was invested and it never drew as much sympathy or connection as the story might have required. Above and beyond that it was a thrilling experience. I'd give it a 8/10 and would strictly recommend it if you wish to see how an audacious director brought about the change in cinema and pushed the boundaries.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow Burn to Inferno</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those Movies that has sadly diminished in its power over time. It was inevitable. But at the time it had a charge that was undeniable. When audiences came out of the Theatre in 1971 they were not the same as when they went in. Few knew the impact that was about to be unleashed on the screen.At the time the "new" violence was just starting to emerge but was only in a smattering of Films and it still could surprise and shock and was at its most effective when coming out of the blue or in an unsuspecting format. Westerns, Horror, War, and Police Movies were starting to include the ultra-violence almost routinely. So for the most part it was expected.But here we have a Drama, a sort of Soap-Opera Story of Newlyweds in the Countryside on a Sabbatical/Vacation. It starred the effeminate Dustin Hoffman and it seemed like a Character study of Marriage and young love relationships. Or so the audience thought. But it was more than that, much more. It ended up being a struggle for Manhood and a penalty for flirtatious, immature behavior erupting, after some very slow burns into one of the most unexpected displays of Cinematic carnage yet witnessed.You can't go back, and things are never the same. But this one was an explosive barrier breaker and changed Movie styles and graphic violence and Screen expectations forever. A seminal work that even today can be quite challenging and impressive. It is at times quite uncomfortably tense and disturbing, but it is a masterwork of an unrestrained uberism.NOTE: Forget the remake, it is a virtually worthless rehash of almost scene for scene without the grit and grind of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Good Guys Left</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's ironic to me that Sam Peckinpah was brought to task during his heyday for being an irresponsible peddler of movie violence. Because compared to just about any movie being released today with a PG-13 rating or higher, Peckinpah's films seem almost cautionary in their depiction of violence and the consequences it has, both mentally and physically, on both the the dealers and recipients of it.In "Straw Dogs," his harrowing 1971 film starring Dustin Hoffman and Susan George, a bookish professor moves with his young wife to England for the peace and quiet they can't find in the volatile U.S. What they find is that the same brutal human nature so evident in their own country exists as readily in the UK and, the movie implies, by extension the whole world. Violence, in other words, is not a product of place and circumstances but is rather a fundamental building block of human nature, existing in all of us, perhaps dormant in many, but needing only the right kind of provocation to manifest itself.What I liked most about Peckinpah's movie is that the violence in it made me feel bad. In revenge movies of today, we're asked to root for the protagonist who often becomes as sadistic as those who have done him wrong. The violence is exhilarating and titillating, and the more gruesome it is the better. But in "Straw Dogs," though we want to see Hoffman's character prevail against the sadists who attack his home, we're depressed by the degrading depths he's forced into in an effort to beat the bad guys at their own game. The moral is that when you're forced to become as bad as the bad guys, there are no longer any good guys left.This is a disturbing film that captures the restless anger and anxiety of a dark time in American culture.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Human Nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best thrillers ever made, with sublime and great performances. The movie has a lot to say, even if you disagree with it (as does the director of the 2011 remake). Dustin Hoffman is really playing it as great as one can. As for the female protagonist: I guess you know what she had to go through in the movie (if not, I'm not gonna spoil it for you) and the risk she was taking back then, when the movie was made. Her role was/is as tough as anything in the movie.The movie itself can be called either realistic or pessimistic I guess. You could also argue that Peckinpah put his view of human nature upon us. Whatever your stance is, the movie is highly intriguing and much better than the remake. Not because there is much difference overall (in the story that is), but because this movie is certain of what it wants and pulls no punches. Not an easy watch at all, but a very good movie indeed</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now that's what I call a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well this movie definitely goes into my top 3 list. You rarely see movies which catch your attention to the last second. Brilliant actors, plot and directing makes this psychological movie a masterpiece. This movie reminds me a lot of Cul De sac by Polanski because in both movies dominates analysis of gender and relationships between them. These both movies show that beautiful women adore relationship with strong men because they feel safer (they need it because they are beautiful so they catch a lot of other male attentions and it is danger of getting raped someday), but however these women marry smart, rich but weak males - I guess because financial security is even more important for these types of women. Talking about plot I enjoyed when Dustin killed those drunks but I also wanted some punishment for Neiles as he got away with killing poor girl (I know it was unintentional behavior but still I get nervous).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing movie, both intelligent and visceral.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In addition to being one of the most controversial movies of its kind over 40 years ago, "Straw Dogs" is still quite a potent and upsetting experience in 2012, the kind of thing that not only has some cutting things to say about relationships and the nature of humankind but also affects us at a gut level as well. It doesn't flinch at any time, nor does it pussyfoot around. Quite simply, director / co-screenwriter Sam Peckinpah is unafraid at any time to show just how ugly things can get once they start escalating. A core theme is the time-honoured one of how much a "civilized" person can take before they snap and resort to primitive methods to protect their homes and lives. Based on the novel "The Siege of Trencher's Farm" by Gordon M. Williams, it tells the story of an American mathematician, David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman), who moves with his young wife Amy (English beauty Susan George) to an isolated village where tensions start arising between them and the locals, among them boisterous barfly Tom Hedden (Peter Vaughan) and Charlie Venner (Del Henney), with whom Amy was once involved. Things take a turn for the worst when the ostracized Henry Niles (played by an uncredited David Warner) is seen in the company of Hedden's daughter and the locals come to confront David, who's given Henry shelter after a car accident. As has been noted, Peckinpah doesn't need to concern himself with style as this story is compelling enough to not need a lot of embellishment. It's told in a methodical, straightforward fashion, with the pacing efficient but never quite racing, even in the brutal, climactic action, wherein David has to use his brains to battle his opponents. The cast is completely convincing right down the line, playing characters who are most definitely not one dimensional. The local atmosphere also helps immeasurably, in addition to Jerry Fielding's music. It makes sense that some viewers of this classic movie may not be able to really appreciate it as it is the sort of experience that sticks with you, for better and for worse. Its power is impossible to deny. The violence is strong and if one sees the uncut version with a key rape sequence restored, the impact is even stronger. "Straw Dogs" truly isn't for the faint of heart: it's grim, uncompromising, and does make one think about their own attitudes towards the subjects examined during the story. Top notch. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a controversial movie that brings out the inner demons of the characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie isn't for everyone and some might get offended while or after watching the whole movie. Some might even interpret the characters slightly differently, like when it comes to who might be at fault. It can even be both. There is multiple view points for this movie and depending on the view point it plays a part in if that certain audience will either like or hate it or even have mixed feelings about it. Some might interpret as human nature or even bringing out the inner demons or even both. I personally didn't find this movie all that great although it goes in a bit of a disturbing direction. I however liked the aspect about the nice calm guy getting pushed to the limit and snapping, sometimes nice guys can be more dangerous and vicious. This has been done before but this brings out sort of the psychological and disturbing parts about it. The thing is reality can be harsh and there is people out there that may not have a conscious when hurting others or have it but does it anyways and this movie brings about those elements. I didn't find this movie to be amazing when it comes to these psychological and disturbing films. But I can sort of understand what it tries to accomplish and for the most part it accomplishes that task for the most part. But still it lacks when it comes to depth and personally didn't keep me thinking afterwards either. It's not a film I personally would watch again because it just didn't entertain me that personally that much, distressful but not all that entertaining, but it's worth a watch.6.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great and delicate thriller by Peckinpah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Third time seeing Sam Peckinpahs movie I am in awe. Being a fan of Peckinpahs since some time I can't help to think this is the movie that will not let you get lost in the use of violence. Peckinpah; much has been written about him as a rebel and perhaps (my own interpretation) as an existentialist. Almost always using his violence as a handle to tell something about the us, about the choices we make, some of his movies somehow manage to disguise his main themes of moral, life and choice.Straw dogs is somewhat different. It is a spectacular thriller. Always close to the itching nerve of what is right it doesn't sway from what is uneasy; both in recognition and perhaps disgust; it is always there on the nerve of choice in difficult situations. Leaving you time to think, who am I? Nothing is black or white. It is up to you (or here Dustin Hoffman) to make the choices. WHEN TO MAKE THEM. The general struggle goes on in every community, in every social context (if not so harsh as here). And thats just the story.... As always montage in world class (the rape scene for ex) and wonderful actors. That this hasn't been considered a masterpiece from the beginning says something of the time and the community where it was released. A remake as has been made; well we don not honestly try to repaint Vermeer, van Gogh or Michelangelo, do we ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dustin' off the demons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Straw Dogs" is a remarkable film. Clearly a lot of time has been put into it, it can be well analysed like "Citizen Kane" (only not as boring) or "Black Swan" and can be dissected to find clever underlying meanings and metaphors that might go past some audiences. If you're an eagle eyed viewer you should be able to spot the various contrasts and links between different scenes and meanings, which is why "Stra Dogs" stands out from most films now a days.My family thought "Straw Dogs" was "slow and were more than likely bored out of their mind for the first hour and a half, so if your a viewer that only wants gracious violence, this film is much much more than that. The first 1hr 30mins brilliantly deals with the rocky relationship between the couple, we can see their feelings for each other slowly declining, as the cracks begin to show. Not just in their own relationship but in their characters as well. Sam Peckinpah shows us a seemingly happy couple moving into an idyllic British location, but slowly reveals the darker side of the couple and everything around them, which is why the writing is just so engrossing and brilliant.Obviously the English clichés are there, we all go around with dodgy teeth, living in small villages in the country where everyone knows everyone and we're all inbreds with only about three brain cells speaking with a Bristol accent. But these clichés are actually used to make all the villagers seem like one character with their sly networking and vicious, sadistic acts."Straw Dogs" is also made brilliantly. Sam's directing manages to catch your attention all the way through with his ingenious parallels and also what vicious impacts has on your mental state. The rape scene is really horrifically done with it seeming really quite realistic and distressing. It also deals with the after-affects realistically and the feeling of isolation and hopelessness is clearly present.The finale is also realistically done and also thought-provoking. It's also good how it not only shows the battle between the couple and the villagers but also the battle between the couple themselves and male dominance is clearly still present, which is a harsh reality for Susan George's character. The attack is thrilling and edge-of-your-seat stuff. It's terrifically filmed and will have you rooting for Dustin and Susan as they viciously fight back."Straw Dogs" was apparently a huge aura of controversy in its day and still after seeing it now it seems shocking and quite brutal. It also still remains a fantastic piece of film-making, with genius writing and directing as well as an engrossing and thrilling finale. "Straw Dogs" is also the perfect title.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in the day, this was the movie that introduced me to Sam Peckinpah. Up till that time, I never really gave a thought to the importance of a director to a film, but this one changed my perspective. Peckinpah uses just as many subtle touches in his characterizations and story telling as he does for violence, and it's those nuances that bring a depth to the film. Consider the way David (Dustin Hoffman) wiped the blood off his hand after shooting the fowl, as if to wipe away the injustice of bringing down a helpless bird. In addition to his outward cowardice, David displays an outright abhorrence to overt displays of macho male behavior (the early bar scene), as the first half of the story does a good job of portraying him as somewhat less of a man.I can still remember the audience response to David's triumphs when I saw this film when it first came out. Each success against his tormentors brought another round of cheers, culminating in that great bear trap maneuver. The set-up for that one was priceless, because all the while you're thinking someone's going to step in that thing, and suddenly it becomes Charlie's necktie.Because movie violence is such a staple today, the action here may seem tame by comparison, but just consider - Hoffman's character had to think on his feet and use the limited resources available to him to protect his home. No big guns or 'lock and load' action, just a man pushed to the limit deciding that "This is where I live. This is me". With that declaration, David crosses his own personal Rubicon and knows there will be no retreat or surrender, only victory or certain death in defeat.I'm watching the picture today as a bit of a warm up for the remake that comes out in a couple of weeks which I'm anxious to see. There will be that bias for the original but I'll go into it with an open mind. In the meantime, this is an all but unknown gem from the early Seventies, a time when film makers like Sam Peckinpah were pushing the envelope on sex, drugs, violence, and yes, even rape in a bold and forthright manner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a morality play for the Vietnam generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Peckinpah and writer Goodman set out to shock in this uncompromising tale of brutality and vengeance in a small English village. A university mathematician and his flighty wife, an incongruous couple fleeing some undefined life-changing event, set up home in the rural hometown of his wife's childhood. The locals quickly set about terrorising them.Despite the 20th century setting, the template is medieval Morality Play. David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman) is the Righteous Man, husband to Amy (Susan George), the Fallen Woman. The band of yokels who brutalise them are less yobs and more Beelzabub and his acolytes. In realist terms, the story is implausible on many levels. David and Amy are an unlikely couple. One mass murderer in an English village would be rare, never mind a band of five of them. There is even a village idiot (read: pervert) whose continued survival amongst his barbarian neighbours is little short of miraculous. The explosion of violence at the end is telegraphed all the way through, and the outcome of that battle is a long shot, to say the least.Straw Dogs looks great with its vivid colour and strong framing. The acting is fantastic, with Susan George in particular asked to be defiant, vulnerable, clingy, murderous, sultry, lustful, disgusted, outraged, flirty... Apparently she was bullied on set, in order to push her to the extremes the role demands. It is not surprising news; the film threads through its misogyny lightly. The story is maddeningly perplexing, centering on the incongruities in David's character. He invites men who clearly lust after his wife into his home, and even chums along with them after they murder his cat. He is a victim then, except that when a vicar visits his home he becomes overbearing and vulgar. The lack of consistency is deliberate, as the filmmakers want you to leave with questions, not answers.However, the questions seem contrived, manufactured to puzzle only and not leading to any greater insight. The narrative thread of Straw Dogs is unconvincing, and the whole thing does not stand the test of time. The clunky exchange of dialogue that ends the film seems to suggest we are all lost souls. The message is undercut by being stated in an artificial world alien to our own. Part thriller, part adaptation of Paradise Lost, Straw Dogs seems to have had something to say to the Vietnam generation, but has little more than curiosity value now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tough and unrelentingly bleak picture, as Peckinpah studies a clashing between classes and genders disturbingly playing out in a pent up and isolated locale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The nausea settles in early on in Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs, an acute angle looking directly down at a town square from that of a church steeple; furthermore going on to inter-cut with another raw angle looking directly up at it from ground level encompassing a young girl perched on a gravestone. Death and religion greet us with these early compositions, and what follows is a masterclass in suspense and angst as classes clash; an unwinding and unravelling of pent up aggression as well as emotion between numerous parties set in the cold, grey, bleak zone of rural South West England. Peckinpah's film is effectively a series of setting things up before the consequent introducing of the proverbial item more than capable of knocking it back down; the placing of these two things in close proximity to one another the game the director takes glee in playing and executes masterfully.Dustin Hoffman plays David Sumner, a mathematician from America currently based in amidst the fields and dirt roads of an isolated English farmhouse with wife, who was once local to the area, Amy (George). David appears a man of little interest in conflict and seems to want to keep himself to himself as often as possible. Back at the house, some locals work on re-tiling the roof to the property's garage, in what is perceived as a lazy and deliberately slow manner by David; their exchanges carrying an unease from the very beginning through nerves to start with and only going on to maintain that sense of tension and disconnection. The true extent of the local's extended presence is later revealed to be more greatly linked to having the ability to be near Amy; the film coming to form, for all its parts, a constant back-and-forth between David and the locals culminating in a quite bloody finale with which the aforementioned nausea has well and truly settled in.The distinction between David and his garage working locals are evident on a basic level in the clothing either party wears and the vehicles they drive; Peckinpah inter-cutting how either of the two sides spend their evenings by showing us the time and activities the workers spend engaging in down at the local public house with David's trawling away in front of a blackboard, shutting himself away in from all else in the process, only to rifle through sums and equations. As the Sumner's occupy their secluded retreat, local teenagers look on from the boundaries of the property; seemingly fascinated by the nature of David and his presence, observing him as if a zoo animal in a pen ? he is very much an outsider to them all and ill-fitting to both their way of life and culture. The attraction those mending the roof of the garage have towards Amy is its own sordid, harrowing but brutally effective strand altogether; the stealing of some of her clothing and the establishing of her gradual sexual alienation from David sees her come to rather not mind being seen topless at a window during the day, everything boiling and brooding as one of her former partners from years ago remains around in town.The Sumner's marriage begins to hit its own contours in the road, the alienation they begin to feel from one another over David's work and the sexual frustration which appears to resonate within Amy a disturbing passage more greatly linked to that of Amy's presence back at the place from whence she comes; her joyous and carefree attitude to her situating there, with David, having her treat the whole thing as if some kind of holiday - much to her husband's gradual annoyance. It is to Hoffman's great credit that he is able to produce the timing and gradual steps in reaching a proverbial boiling point as the place and the people and the situation take their unremitting toll on him as he just tries to work. Pekinpah shoots most of the sequences as the palpable tension between both David and the locals rises from David's own point of view, the shooting of the workmen from a house window gradually having us come to observe the world through his own perspective having us side with the victimised party. A similar technique is applied later on, that of a perspective of one of the roofers during a duck hunt they invite him out on; the consequent seating of him in the middle of nowhere enabling them to identify him as someone totally ill at ease when given a weapon and put in a rather aggressive situation in which he must adopt the role of the aggressive perpetrator.The film will culminate with such information fresh in the minds of the roofers; a sickly skirmish involving David and the locals and like many of Peckinpah's finales, it consists of a shoot out or an all-out-war of some kind at a hemmed-in locale between numerous people harbouring different beliefs on the overall scenario thus forcing parties of numerous kinds to participate. Most of David's actions during the finale is born out of his own daft lust for heroism, the seeing of himself as a protector without knowing the full facts behind a situation; a blind rage of egotism and maniacal drive, the proving to himself and to others, specifically Amy, that he is not, in fact, at all cowardly. It's a notion which is ultimately demonised, mostly everybody comes off for the worse with nearly everybody loosing something ? some more serious than others. The film is brash and confrontational, but it requires Pekinpah's dab-hand at building displeasure, tension and an unnerved sense throughout in what is a grisly but eerily involving thriller in which classes violently come together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stay until the end, you will not be disappointed!I said that because more than half of the film, we are in village life and the couple Sumner life played by Dustin Hoffman and Susan George and it's long time. This gives us an impression of introducing implementation extremely long. That long? Why? Throughout this part, we feel it will happen unhealthy things, especially through suspicious characters at first glance, and we know that there will be violence when we know the director Sam Peckinpah. But what we expect is slow to arrive. This transcribes well nevertheless unhealthy atmosphere that hangs around the couple and their feelings, especially those of Amy Sumner who feels and knows better than her husband David.Through its filmmaking and interpretation, tone placement in the movie is ideally suited to his plot. All elements of westerns are there. It is a pure contemporary western (at the time of release of the film of course).Everything moves gradually to reach what we suspect. But it does not happen crescendo but roughly and long and as the nature of what is suspected. I write like that (abstract) for not revealing the plot of the film despite some reluctance Straw dogs is a film that deserves to be seen and that you'll remember.jeliosjelios@hotmail.fr</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David (Dustin Hoffman), a mathematician and his wife, Amy (Susan George) move to the English countryside to get some rest. David walks into a door full of violence, hate and sex that he can't and don't want control anymore.Sam Peckinpah's controversial classic is more about pride than about violence. There's machismo, rape and murder to get a scream in the 1970s. Much people says that the violence is outdated now just because it's not as explicit as the thing we see today. The thing is not how explicit you showed it, is how you showed it. It's context makes it, though bearable, very uncomfortable.Hoffman is, like in his good ol'days, excellent. Susan George is good as the wife too, even if she opens her mouth too much. All the irreverence of it's violence and this two characters (And how the actors traduce them) makes a worthwhile, violent experience about violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely different from his stylized gun slinging violent classic 'The Wild Bunch', Sam Peckinpah's 'Straw Dogs' is brilliant tense film where violence is slowly heightening its tension towards intense and awesome climax. Dustin Hoffman plays a mathematician too mild for her demanding hot young wife Susan George. Their arrival to town starts unhealthy sexually and psychologically boiling tension throughout the film. A bunch of street ruffians become part of their private life, becoming vigilante of the couple making both of them uncomfortable. The wife was terribly gang raped and the hubby is pushed to the limit and the rest is all Sam Peckinpah style shattering authentic portrayal of rough slow motion violence.Hoffman is fine again but what I love the most is the way Peckinpah built the tension with young and ravishing character of Susan. She is very ambiguous character guided by her sexual urges often demanding attention with her skin projection provoking strangers. But as soon as we watch that terrible rape scene, she gains all our sympathy. Rape is more psychological torture than physical and Peckinpah made us felt that too. More than half an hour long climax inside Hoffman's home is something only we can expect from Peckinpah. He's original and master auteur as far as rough cinematic violence is concerned. Strongly recommended to all violence suckers.Ratings- 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I keep crossing the long-awaited classics off my "to see-list" and for a Dustin Hoffman-ophile like myself, this one was long-awaited: Infamous thriller drama from Sam Peckinpah about timid American mathematician (Hoffman) who moves to rural England town with his British wife (George). Not before long they are slowly, but increasingly terrorized by townsmen who just as quickly shed their human morals and values. Takes it sweet time to build up (which is its major weakness) its atmosphere and detonate, but when it does, those final 40 min's will have you up the wall! Not only for its graphic violence (which by today's standards seems fairly average!), but the bravura suspense trip that is nothing but a pure editing triumph. One can only guess how much John Carpenter was influenced by that house barricade before making "Assault on precinct 13"! Given its reputation, this is definitely not one-track minded, but intensely forceful and more than ambiguous, including a rape scene wide open for discussion just as much as its classic central violence- and self-defense theme that is subtly implied more than once throughout: How much would YOU take before hitting back? Also, small, good characterizations (mostly by not making Hoffmann's &amp; George's relationship all lovey-dovey) and shot with director Peckinpah's distinct flamboyant flair. 6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't read the novel. This is the third Peckinpah film I have watched, the other two being Convoy and The Osterman Weekend. It it thus the best of his that I've seen. The ambiguity throughout this is impeccable, and leaves a ton of room for interpretation and discussion. David and Amy Summer move to rural England, and experience growing harassment from the locals. Gradually, the tension builds in this movie, advancing mercilessly towards the climax that cannot be averted. The script is well-written, with well-developed, psychologically credible characters(whom you may not necessarily like), an interesting plot and dialog that is generally great and holds several memorable lines. Acting tends to be marvelous, and Hoffman may not have wanted to be in this, but he doesn't seem to have allowed that to affect his work. The cinematography and editing are in Sam's distinct style, with effective inter-cutting and use of slow-motion. Atmosphere and mood is carefully built up, and this is quite suspenseful. The music is fitting. There is infrequent moderate language, strong, brutal disturbing and controversial content and violence in this. The DVD I got held only three trailers: Eddie, The Big Easy and Albino Alligator. I recommend this to any fan of the director, the genre, and/or to a lesser extent, anyone else involved in making it. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1971 flick 'Straw Dogs' is a true classic. Sure it's disturbing, violent and way to adult. But the fact remains that it's a brave and gripping fare which doesn't bore. In my eye, its one of the best 70's flick from Hollywood. Two Thumbs up!Performances: Dustin Hoffman is fantastic. He plays his part to perfection. He leaves you speechless towards the climax, which is gory. Susan Grorge looks hot and does a splendid job. The villains are effective.'Straw Dogs' is a violent drama, with a disturbing rape scene and nudity attached to it. But watch this film because it's brave and gripping.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked idea of this movie but I think it wasn't portrayed very well. Somehow everything happened to fast and many acts of characters appeared unclear to me. The director of this film should more concentrate on psychological pressure that Dustin Hoffman's character gets because one moment he is shy and coward and than another moment he is acting like psychopath. It wasn't clear at which point exactly did he break. This movie considered to be very violent but actually it's nothing compared with nowadays horror movies. Anyways i liked an idea and the movie itself was pretty good. There were some original and realistic death scenes. This movie is pretty good only some things wasn't clear enough to me but you should check it out anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The funny bit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Peckinpah's Cornish western, there's a suggestion the co-writer/director may not be taking things too seriously. During the course of the Siege of Trencher's Farm, the odious rat catcher (Jim Norton) is seen riding a kid's tricycle. One of his fellow thugs chases him with it, threatening to wrap it round his neck. The next shot shows them racing each other, both on tricycles, amidst the mayhem. I can't think of any other slapstick moments in Peckinpah's other violent set pieces. And later, Hoffman dispatches the rat catcher with what looks suspiciously like a golf swing. Perhaps it would have been more fitting to the latter's profession if he'd been the one to succumb to the trap.With neat irony, Hoffman's maths professor has picked the wrong fight in protecting David Warner, who has just (albeit accidentally) killed village strumpet Sally Thomsett (who I suspect of killing the cat). At the moment when he fears his wife Susan George will switch sides to old beau Charlie (Del Henney), he specifically becomes his rival, striking her, then pulling her by the hair, both of which Charlie has inflicted on her prior to the bizarre rape turned love scene turned gang rape. So whilst there's audience pleasure in seeing the bad guys wiped out, are we also to acknowledge this as an anti-violence statement?One thing's for sure: this mismatched couple isn't going to make it.Along with those mentioned above, Ken Hutchison is also impressive as the 'bad' rapist, in a uniformly excellent cast.Interesting to see the name of Tony Lawson as one of the editors. There's occasional time jump editing in this that figures strongly in his work for Nic Roeg (from Bad Timing onwards), and also in Peckinpah's later Cross of Iron, which along with Barry Lyndon Lawson also edited. And, I don't know if it's just me, but I love John Coquillon's grey skies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They couldn't give director Sam Peckinpah (The Wild Bunch, Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia) an Oscar for this film, so they nominated it for musical score. After all, the film was banned in some areas for excessive violence and sex.The sex in the film was violent as Amy (Susan George - The House Where Evil Dwells) is raped by what I surmise was an old beau and one of his friends while they had her husband David (Dustin Hoffman) out in the woods hunting birds.But, the violence didn't stop there as a group of outraged citizens went after a man (David Warner - Titanic, Time After Time) they believed did something to a young girl. Any resemblance that Hoffman had to his Rain Man or Graduate characters disappeared as he strove to protect the man. He definitely showed that there is a violent beast within all of us that is waiting to be unleashed at the right moment.It was a hard movie due to the violence, but an excellent example of Peckinpah's work.</fullReview>

Its very well made, very well done, and very nasty. Its the last aftershock from a seismic golden age in Seventies cinema-A Clockwork Orange, The Exorcist and few others which were also the last to be granted certificate after almost 20 years in censorship limbo. Despite its powerful merits as a work of art, Straw dogs remains probably the most notorious mainstream film ever made on British soil. While emotionally powerful in a very negative way and also profoundly fatalistic, its also frighteningly soul shatteringly bleak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alternately brilliant and frustrating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dustin Hoffman and Susan George move to rural England and come into conflict with a gang of local hooligans (anyone who's lived in small towns/rural environments will recognize these types immediately). The situation escalates until finally, through an odd confluence of events, Hoffman takes a stand. Frustrating movie is alternately exceptionally brilliant and ridiculously contrived, sometimes within a few seconds of each other. The plot is incredibly contrived and unbelievable the moment you stop to think about it (who really believes Hoffman and George would ever really end up together, for instance?) , but individual sequences: Susan George's rape, the big standoff at the farm, David Warner killing the girl, the final shot, etc. are immensely well-done. One has the feeling that this, like WILD BUNCH, was an attempt on Peckinpah's part to adapt a genre tale to his own ends; unfortunately, the restrictions of the thriller genre (which STRAW DOGS essentially is) confine Peckinpah in the way a Western never could. Flawed, then, but still well worth watching ? a powerful statement of a powerful vision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dustin Hoffman made his second best performance here, besides RainMan. I have always been a huge fan of his, even more so when I saw 'I heart Huckabees'. And Sphere, what a sci-fi flick. I'm not usually into such films, but that was well done. Now that he has made 'Meet the Fockers', I see his standards have lowered, and his days of great cinema attractions are over. FYI: Hoffman was born in Los Angeles, California and graduated from Los Angeles High School where he was voted "least likely to succeed. His first ambition was to be a concert pianist and he attended the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music. Then, with an interest in medicine, he attended Santa Monica City College for a year before dropping out due to poor grades. In an effort to bolster his grades during that year, he took an acting class because he was told "nobody flunks acting."Weird eh?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Straw Dogs was an amazing film. The cinematography, for once, plays a crucial role in alluding to the feelings of the characters. At times, one is immersed in the calm landscape alluding to the introverted nature of the protagonist (Hoffman), while at other times, odd and acute angles intersect with tense scenes. At times, Peckinpah frames the scene in a brilliant manner referring to the medium of film, so not only is it artistic, but a very modern film.The violence, the tension, and distress are felt throughout the film, one cannot help but feel what Hoffman feels: ignored anger and the inability to confront the issues at hand. The changing camera angles and the montage effects further create within one the effect of the fear of confrontation. The tension needs to be resolved, and because of this one cannot help but keep one's eyes glued to the screen! The tension builds to the point where violence is inevitable and the psyche breaks, bringing about a storm of violence purging the bottled feelings of tension and distress that escalate as the film progresses. Not until the end does one feel the calm after the storm, after the blood has been shed, after the feelings of anger and carnal hatred have been purged.Overall an amazing film and superb direction. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NEVER walk in front of a guy playing darts!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing raises the ire of an alpha-male more than seeing a hot chick with a nerd. And that is just what we have with Straw Dogs. Dustin Hoffman plays a nerd who is married to a beautiful young English woman. The two have moved to a tiny town in rural England to escape the turmoil of the good old USA and so Hoffman can write some kind of book about math or science, or something nerdy like that. The couple barely gets settled into their new home before the locals begin harassing them.Hoffman is not a target simply because he is a foreigner. He is targeted because he seems out of place in the local town, especially in the pub. Early on we see him dare to enter the establishment and ask for "any kind of American cigarettes". He also commits a great sin by walking in front of a guy throwing darts. But his greatest sin is the fact that he is married to a former girlfriend of one of the local alpha-males. This only leads to jealousy, and considerable acrimony.A few of the guys are very slowly helping to upgrade the young couple's home. At one point, the young woman dares to tease the locals with a quick glimpse of her bare breasts. Before you know it, the harassment is under way. A pair of her panties are stolen for starters. Then, their cat is hanged in the closet. (Poor cat! First we see Hoffman throwing fruit at it, then it gets killed!) Eventually, the young woman is brutally raped. Things come to a head when the couple give shelter to a wounded man suspected of murdering a girl back in town. Things are finally solved by a very violent confrontation. We see Hoffman's character change from an even-tempered pacifist to a violent vigilante after he is pushed too far.This film is actually quite good when you add up all the elements. The film looks great, even though the director likes to use a few too many cuts for my taste. There is one hell of a lot of glass that gets broken. I haven't seen a film break so much glass since Another 48 Hours. Is it some kind of coincidence that the writer for that film (Roger Spotiswoode) was the editor of this film? The violence is raw, but not over the top as some would claim. There is a graphic rape scene, but it's nothing near as bad as the Death Wish movies or Casualties of War. The film is very well-acted, and the conclusion should satisfy many viewers.This is not a landmark piece of cinema, but it certainly will be worth your time to take a look at it. The unrated version is the only one I have seen, and it would be about 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flying in the face of, yet perfectly suited for the era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Straw Dogs" (1971): Sam Peckinpah wrote and directed this late peace movement era film, which flew in the face of his entire audience (as usual). With stars like Dustin Hoffman and Susan George, it could not be dismissed as just another "B grade" movie. Even Peckinpah's production values were much improved. It's a simple story: a young couple moves to the English countryside to find a little peace and quiet, pursue intellectual interests, work on their relationship, and breathe some fresh air?but find just the reverse waiting for them. Hoffman, a bookish, wimpy sort of a fellow, and his wife, an immature girl-woman who has no clue who she is or what she wants from a man, are increasingly subjected not only to one another, but to the "locals". Peckinpah is amazingly patient with "Straw Dogs" ? normally known for his relentless "ballets in blood" ? takes it's time building and building the tension, until there is nothing left to do but what must be done. Hoffman's character, David, has the spotlight throughout, however George's role of "Amy", gets increasingly impressive. Most interesting to me was the emotional &amp; spiritual journey of David, whose reactions to what must be done are NOT what he, his wife, or we expected. The very last scene, as he drives a mildly retarded man home in the night, is haunting and unforgettable.</fullReview>

The story unfolds, as does Hoffman and the rest of the cast, into a lust-fest of debauchery and hate. Hoffman tries to ignore it, but he is eventually forced to get involved. The demons consume themselves in wonderful Pekinpah fashion. This film is one of those shamefull self indulgences which should be watched with hot, fresh, buttered popcorn, and being sure that you've gone to the bathroom before you sit down to watch it.

		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah's Cornish western was undoubtedly groundbreaking and provocative thirty years ago, but time hasn't been kind to it. Too many questions remain unanswered, credibility is stretched far beyond breaking point (regularly) and virtually every plot point is telegraphed well in advance. Having said that, it remains a fascinating piece of cinema, with top-notch photography, direction and (especially) editing, and authentic performances all round. By the time you get to the frantic, disturbing finale, all your sympathies lie with the Hoffman character, which is either a good or a bad thing depending on your viewpoint. Peckinpah pulls out every trick in the book to manipulate the audience into demanding blood and thunder, and then delivers it in spades. My advice to anyone who wants to watch Straw Dogs is to choose a time and a place carefully, as this still isn't a film to be taken lightly. Ultimately, it's a matter of taste, and very much a product of its time, both of which should be taken into account.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, Straw Dogs has its flaws and these are well-documented by previous corespondents. The premise of a pacifist solving his problems by using extreme violence seems odd, especially when he apparently shows signs of enjoying it. Some of the other flaws listed I agree with also. However if the purpose of a movie is to stir up the emotions and to have a lasting effect on the viewer it is a resounding success. After experiencing the final 30 minutes of extreme violence-laden action my heart was racing at 100 miles an hour and took ages to slow down - the movie simply was bloody exhilirating! Its effect on me was unlike any other movie I can recall. When I discussed Straw Dogs with a work colleague some years later he said it had exactly the same effect on him. Obviously Peckinpah knows how to excite viewers. Moral: if you have a weak heart, don't watch it, otherwise enjoy! Rating 9/10.</fullReview>

This is always a good start to see a film : without any prejudice. It rolled over me like a flood. On one hand the narrow-minded evil of a small British village poisoned by the wickedness of racism against anything coming from "outside", oiled by bottles of whiskey and on the other hand an unworldly young American couple grown up with the customs of a flower-power-age at a U.S.-university, not aware of the upheaval they cause and full off good intentions to "integrate". The result is stifling but never overdone. The violence is raw, but expected as a logic and fluent result of the prologue. Very impressive. It also shows that, even in the time-period of flower-power and "peace, no war", narrow-mindedness still existed - and always will. Alarm, possible spoiler : a peaceful "mathematics professor" turns into a "calculated" fighter. The first part of the movie is built up as a real prelude of violence to the massacre in the second part I'm happy and content I bought the dvd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mild mannered American Mathematition and his English wife move into her remote Cornish farmhouse where she grew up. The locals resent his presence and the fact that he has married one of 'their girls'. While driving home one foggy night, the couple hit a local retarded man who has accidentally suffocated a girl from the village. Not aware of this, they take him to the farmhouse for help. Before long the local roughnecks are laying seige to the house, demanding that the couple turn the man over to them for 'questioning' about the girl's dissappearance. The American refuses, knowing what will happen if he hands over the suspect, and the situation descends into all out violence. I watched this last night as it had its UK television premiere on Channel Four. Along with 'A Clockwork Orange' it was banned for many years here, only seeing the light of day on DVD late last year. The previous evening Channel Four screened an excellent documentary on the troubled history of the film, presented by Film Critic Mark Kermode. My appetite duly whetted, I sat down expecting either a masterpiece or a total letdown. The result lay somewhere between the two. The film builds slowly and menacingly, before finally exploding into violence near the end. However, so accustomed have we become to graphic on screen violence that its effect is lessened compared to what it would have been 32 years ago. The transformation of Dustin Hoffmann's character remains interesting nevertheless. The real problem with the film is of course the attitude to Susan George's character. From the outset Peckinpah depicts her as a tease and a flirt, so by the time we get to the double rape we are almost supposed to think 'she was asking for it'. This is compounded by her reaction to the first rape. These are dangerous messages for filmmakers to send out to society and one must question Peckinpah's agenda here. At his best (The Wild Bunch, Cross Of Iron) Sam Peckinpah was a truly gifted Director. 'Straw Dogs' is no classic but it remains interesting and challenging. I'm glad I took the time to see it and I would probably watch it again. However, it can be an unsettling veiwing experience, but perhaps that was the point, that violence is distressing and ugly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot think of another movie that explores the nature of violence better than Straw Dogs.Peckinpah manages to dream up ideal situations where his male characters' sense of masculinity is so threatened, that the only obvious response is an explosion of violence. This applies not only to the bourgeoisie American protagonist David (Dustin Hoffman) but also to the proletariat brits that lay siege on his house.However, "Straw Dogs" gives the female protagonist, Amy (Susan George) the most sympathetic light. It is ironic that the movie been accused of anti-feminist. Amy is the most reasonable character, and easy to identify with. It is true that female sexuality is often the spark that sets off the violence in the movie, but the fuel is fed by frustrated, confused and misogynistic males.The tension in the movie starts tight and does not let up until after the final bloody climax. Movies rarely achieve such palpable violence and force the audience to think about many dark topics. If the movie is ugly and difficult to watch, it is because Peckinpah achieve exactly what he wanted.</fullReview>

Groundbreaking and shocking for its day, 'Dogs' may appear to be tame by today's standards, but that doesn't lessen its impact. At the heart of the story is man's animal nature and how fine a line it can be. Peckinpah also seems to explore how female sexuality can provoke this animal behavior. Setting the story in England is essential to building Hoffman's character. He's a man disconnected with his foreign surroundings and completely out of his element. This adds an even greater tension. There's alot of great filmmaking at work here. Highly recommended. (Do you think he goes back to his wife at the end?).</fullReview>

Still,the terrorising of city or foreign people is reality in some villages.It happened in Holland that prehistorical villagers started to throw bricks and stuff to a house in which city people had moved in,so the idea of terror is pretty well thought out.The rape scene is not effective and not really necessary in this movie,but it was probably done to give the villagers a badder character so that Dusty could wipe them out without the viewer really caring.The ending(last 20 minutes or so)was remade in the 90's,because the final fight in the house is also being used in Home Alone although Peckinpah's version is much more violent and much more realistic.Overall,not brilliant but pretty good. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peckinpah comes full force with STRAW DOGS, after various examinations of male-bonding and macho rituals in excellent films like THE WILD BUNCH and THE FAR COUNTRY. Here Peckinpah and his writer, David Zelig Goodman, do whatever it takes to set us up for the full impact of their protagonist's trial by fire. That the mechanisms and characterizations employed are controversial is a moot point; that they deliver the intended emotional impact, is the ultimate measure of the picture's power. Themes and actions here are multi-layered, ambivalent and intense, as they often are in truly powerful works by major filmmaking talents. STRAW DOGS is an evocative, highly personal, philosophical release by a passionate filmmaker with strong opinions and unrestrained sensibilities. Sam Peckinpah's masterpiece is now a worthy addition to The Criterion Collection in a nicely packaged special-edition DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That rape scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead.There has been a lot of comment on the rape scene, and much seems misguided as to the motivations of the characters. It is clear to me, that the first rapist is Susan George's ex-boyfriend. She still fancies him, especially as she is being ignored by her husband. She offers him a drink and he says he will go if she wanted, but she doesn't. Then he rapes her, but after the initial shock she appears to enjoy it. Deeply morally ambiguous, but we can see why this is not as preposterous as it sounds. Then a second man rapes her, at which point she screams and fights, while the ex-boyfriend holds her down. Only now does she realise what these men are capable of, and that's why she is so keen to give them the suspect child molester when they come en-masse in the night. Hoffman doesn't know about any of this, his motivation is simply to 'do what is right'. Presumably Susan George wouldn't have been willing to shoot the last attacker unless she knew the consequences of not doing so. I should imagine in 1971 a woman shooting a man on film was quite rare and no doubt shocking.So there we are, all quite straight forward really. Hoffman ends up by driving off with the child molester, leaving his wife abandoned in the house filled with brutally murdered men, because he doesn't care any more, as he says, he doesn't know the way home any more. So he drives off both literally and symbolically.</fullReview>

I can appreciate why it was banned in Britain - the fact that Amy begins to enjoy the rape, and the negative depiction of South-Western rural communities. There are some classy directoral touches, such as the freeze-frames at the most violent points (as used in The Wild Bunch) and the provocative camera angles between Hoffman and George. Dustin Hoffman is perfectly cast as the outsider.POSSIBLE SPOILERS - What is he fighting for at the end?? To save his wife? No, as she was ready to leave, and was only restrained by violence on Hoffman's part. The life of Henry Niles? Maybe, but Hoffman knows he is a child molester although he is oblivious of the fact that he has murdered the girl. His house and property? Quite naturally, but what is most interesting is the fact that he is fighting for a cause when in fact he knows he isn't. His marriage seems doomed, Niles has killed the girl, his house is wrecked. At the end, he says to Niles that he too doesn't know his way home, so he has acknowledged his fate. This is a tussle with himself, his masculinity and his role as a man. A mathematician who is loathe to use violence overcomes the odds when the chips are down, to prove to himself he can do it. The English cast are brilliantly sinister and uncompromising in their attitudes towards Hoffman. All round a good film. **** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peckinpah's masterpiece tells the story of mathematician writing a book (Dustin Hoffman), who moves to England with his wife (Susan George), to escape all of the social turmoil going on in America. He is harassed by the locals, and eventually forced to defend his home. The film is a powerful expression of the territorial animal instinct that every man (even the most refined, such as Hoffman's character) possesses. While many may find it too intense and raw, if you can stomach it, this movie is an incredibly powerful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 70's sure produced some fine films in a decade that also spawned pet rocks and the Brady Bunch. Ole Sam cleverly uses his trademark ugly violence to show how anyone can be pushed into it if they're provoked enough. Here's an interesting theory: Did the 2 leads deserve their fate? And as well, did the thugs in turn deserve theirs? The irony is that Hoffman's character goes thru his ordeal because he himself is protecting a killer. What a riot. Comical death scenes here are realistically explored even if, at times, the story plays out like a slasher movie, long before the slasher craze began. Spoiler: whenever you see a cat in a movie like this, you know it's doomed not to make it to the last hour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've heard some people decry the end of the American Western. Not me. The form is antiquated, and Sam Pekinpah proves here that the same themes of a lonely man taking on a ruthless world and the inevitability of violence can apply to the modern world in a totally different setting. In most cases the modern western would be a cop movie, but this time it actually takes place in a quiet little English town. Pekinpah ultimately forces you to enjoy the violence, crave more, and respect our hero's use of it. Dustin Hoffman is pretty close to the top of his game here.</fullReview>

However, I saw it on a wet, Sunday afternoon in an almost empty cinema. Couldn't convince my girlfriend (now wife of 25 years) to go. I'd taken her to see A Clockwork Orange and was in her 'bad books'! Watch it every few months or so. Lived for a while in the area depicted in the movie. Peckinpah was right on with his depiction of local life. So, watching the movie is a little of a nostalgia trip - minus the violent stuff thank goodness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A controversial but powerful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Speaking of "Straw Dogs", let me paraphrase Oscar Wilde: a movie is not either sexist or anti-sexist: a movie is either good or bad, and that's all. "Straw Dogs" is certainly a very good movie, though not reaching the level of the major Peckinpah's achievements.Perhaps it is better to point out first some defects of the movie. It is too long and slow-paced, and after a while the viewer just starts to wait for the (predictable) final show-down. The acting is somewhat flat, and Hoffmann seems uneasy in the role of David Sumner. David's wife Amy (Susan George) was born in the village; the mentality of small communities makes it unlikely that the local thugs torment so ruthlessly the young couple (even the rape seems more probable that this continuous teasing). There is a major naiveness: a mathematician like David could not live in such an isolated village. He should need scientific contacts with colleagues, or at least a library to consult journals (books are not enough). A mathematician is not a writer who, a priori, could live like a hermit.The movie have remarkable merits. The setting is much accurate. The sense of strain and suspense is masterly built. The final fight is fantastic, as always when Peckinpah deals with action.But what makes "Straw Dogs" really outstanding are two ideas of the author, in fact the two most original but also disturbing and controversial ones. First, in the rape scene, when Amy allures her former boy-friend and seems to appreciate his rape (but she doesn't realize that he is not alone!). And later she says nothing to her husband. Most disturbing! We all would have preferred for Amy to be an innocent victim. But Peckinpah likes tough folks: men have sexual desires, and women have sexual desires, too. When something goes wrong, Peckinpah's men don't keep whining and seeking help; and the same for women. Is this sort of symmetry man-woman sexism? Maybe, but in any case the audience is shaken to the core, and this was probably the purpose of the director.The second extremely original idea is that the final slaughter is not caused by the rape (which David ignores, don't forget it). In fact David becomes dreadfully violent on the ground of his liberal principles (!), to save the idiot of the village Henry from a lynch-law. And here Amy shows her meanness, wanting to abandon the miserable Henry to the assassins (that also are her own rapists). And then we see David dizzy at the revelation of his own capacity to be violent: this is a powerful piece of cinema.It is difficult to really love "Straw Dogs"; probably it is easier to hate it, in spite of its merits. Nonetheless, the movie is a powerful work, with plenty of extremely interesting if disturbing matter. After all, a must-see film (not for delicate souls).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah had that rare ability to generate unforgettable images onto the screen--and eventually into your deep memory. Straw Dogs is filled with these sharp, vivid and unusual images. No matter how many times I view the film, I still can feel the wet and ghostly fog that engulfs the killing field. And I am always stunned by that strange smirk on Dustin Hoffman's face as he goes about destroying his murderous tormentors. And how about the shot of the good constable killed by a shotgun blast and sent flying across the yard. And in almost revenge for this act, there is the horrible and painful quick shot of the deflected shotgun blast tearing off the shoe and foot of the old man coming through the window. And the vivid images go on and on: Dustin Hoffman hurling hot oil in the faces of his attackers... beating the red-nosed clown to death ...and killing one of them by pushing his head into a beartrap And throughout the rampage there is the deep etched face of Hoffman with his broken glasses and determined stance. I recently caught this 30-year-old masterpiece on cable--and I can't wait to see it again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is sad that "Straw Dogs" is only remembered by film fans and the few who were fortunate enough to see it in 1971. The film was released the same year as "Clockwork Orange" and the rest as they say is history. Sam Peckinpah was a master at building suspense and then capping it off with well orchestrated yet graphic violence. What separates "Straw Dogs" from Kuberick's film is the personalization of the story and violence. While Kuberick's work takes almost a pedestrian view of violence, Peckinpah draws us into the story. The result is a disturbing, yet masterful character study of violence, and the lengths a person will go to defend what is his.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A beautiful movie about a guy whose pacifism is put in a rude test by a bunch of bullies. I think this movie is also about everyone of us, about the coward and the brave that sleep in every person, about the straw dog that's inside of every human being. Considered as a violent movie for the time it was shot (1969), nowadays can be seen as an almost soft movie. There is a sex scene or two in it, which someone might find disturbing (and understandably so), but this is surely not a sex movie. It's only about a pacifist man who becomes violent because he lives in a violent world. Dustin Hoffman gives an outstanding performance here and Susan George is very good too. But the most beautiful thing in this movie is surely Peckinpah's directing: this is surely one of his best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Straw Dogs, sure is one of the best movies that Sam Peckinpah made during his long and fruitful career. It explores one of the man`s darkest conflicts, a conflict within himself, viewed through the lens of distorted rural English community. Hoffman, seen as a coward by village bullies, as well as his own wife,(George), redeems himself at the end, defending his home like his castle, and at the same moment, standing up to pure vulgarity. This movie has all the characteristics that Peckinpah`s movies have, but in the nutshell, it`s just a story about duality of each person, and the choices every one of us have to make at least couple of times in our lifetime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...A slightly flawed masterpiece at best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STRAW DOGS is yet another incredible work from the late Sam Peckinpah. His uncanny ability to totally absorb you into the story prevails once again as it did in the WILD BUNCH. All I ever read these days about this film is controversy &amp; of course, violence. Well I may be a little desensitized in my old age, but I really didn't focus too much on the violence &amp; sexual assaults.Rather what really seemed to hold my attention throughout the film was the relationship between Dr. Sumner and his wife Amy. Dustin Hoffman gives a superb performance as a mathematician who moves to England with his new wife. They return to her maiden village, where trouble with the locals seems inevitable.My father comes from a small village in Portugal, and speaking from experience, this film is totally believable &amp; realistic. At the end of the film Doctor Sumner empathizes with Henry Niles when he says, "I don't know my way home". At this point in the film Dr Sumner feels as alienated as a known petaphile.And finally, my only problem with the film: What was up with Amy from the point of the rape to the end of the film? At first she fights the rape then enjoys it? And at the very end of the film, she wants to leave the protection &amp; sanctity of a man who would die for her, to go outside the house where a bunch of dirty rapists wait for her? Why did she stay behind in the house with all those corpses and not leave with David? Why was there no resolution to David &amp; Amy's relationship?But I don't blame these questions I have on Peckinpah, these are the fault of the writer. And I have to admit they left me confused, angry, and bewildered. So these questions are the reason I refer to this film as a slightly flawed masterpiece at best. Sam Peckinpah, one of the greatest, most innovative filmmakers of his time; only matched by Stanley Kubrick &amp; his present-day prodigy, John Woo.</fullReview>

And then, while Amy attempts to stop Charlie's advances, suddenly an unexpected miracle: Amy converts Charlie's cruelty into something else ? sorry Amy... I'm sorry ?

		<shortDescription>one in a few and the best film ever AGAINST violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So far there has been no film in cinema history that manages to make you detest violence as much as this film. This is especially notable in view of the fact that it is made by a director who, rightfully, was otherwise suspected of glorifying violence in many of his film. Here the violence is not glorified - you really experience its devastating effect much because it is being executed by a character (wonderfully played by Hoffman) who, MOST RELUCTANTLY BUT NECESSARILY, uses it to protect an innocent man.What makes this film so extraordinary though is the, so seldom depicted, theme of humiliation by proxy. When a man is made cuckold this is a theme of general amusement in our society. What it is really about was first depicted by George Büchner in his famous play "Woyzek". This film is, besides the violence topic, also a distant relative of "Woyzek". It should be noted that if I am 80 years old and my 80 year old wife is "unfaithful" with a 30 year old man, I should have little reason to act violently and instead be amused in amazement. If I am 20 or 30 and my wife the same and the same thing happens, then, however, it is a whole different ball game. "Woyzek" shows this in all clarity but for those idiots out there who believe it is raining when somebody empties his bladder on their head, I may emphasize that if you care for a person and give more than half of all your sweated-for income to that person in order to keep holy what only belongs to you two and she gives it all away for free while she has plenty to give and not while she is 80 years old - then you are humiliated through her (therefore by proxy) and make no mistake about it. If you allowed that without any compensation you would soon be in harms way - make no mistake about it! If there is compensation then you are a pimp and that is a whole different story which we need not go into here.The devil rules through confusion and the modern man believes that it is raining. This film makes clear that it is not and that may be very uncomfortable to many an idiot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Some vague spoilers* Film censors, among their many sins, have a tendency to get the wrong end of the stick. Straw Dogs became one of the most high profile victims of censorship on the grounds of its sheer brutal violence (not to mention an especially grotesque rape scene). But despite its content it was never intended to be a brainless bloodfest. The aim was to be shocking, but only for the purpose of condemning violence, director and co-writer Sam Peckinpah's belief being that an unpleasant enough depiction of something could serve to ward people off it.Straw Dogs has also been defended, quite rightly, for its overall quality and intelligence in production. Let's focus first of all on Peckinpah's work as a director. His style is so full of noticeable intricacies that almost every shot has been picked apart by his gaggle of devotees. However I find while his fans tend to marvel at his symbolism, foreshadowing and motifs, they miss his strong command of basic film grammar. Take, for example, the shot near the beginning where Del Henney (Charlie) helps Dustin Hoffman get the mantrap in the back of the car, which Peckinpah fanatics will point out as foreshadowing the later physical struggle between the two men. But more important to how this scene impacts upon us is the fact that Hoffman appears cut off from his wife, and is unable to protect her from Henney's advances. Most in the audience will not be aware of this ? we are not supposed to be ? but it does give us a very strong impression on a subconscious level, far more than any bit of "symbolism". Throughout the picture Peckinpah is using the same kind of tricks to show us who is dominant, who is isolated, who is in trouble and so forth.Peckinpah's analysts also tend to overlook the acting in his pictures, which is a pity because he invariably worked with excellent albeit unsung players. Many were considered for the lead role, including Donald Sutherland and Jack Nicholson, both of whom have the necessary capacity for mad rage, but only Dustin Hoffman has the meekness that makes it seem such a case of a breaking point reached. He also keeps this mask of calm normality regardless of what is happening, which is highly effective. Susan George is pretty good too for someone who made her name in sleazy B-flicks, and gives a very believable presentation of a woman on the cusp between teens and maturity. Best of all however are the men of the village. Peter Vaughan is a bit of spot-on casting, genuinely scary as the boisterous patriarch. The others, Henney, Ken Hutchison, Jim Norton and Donald Webster give such incredibly real portrayals of young English lads. I have met men like that, and have suffered their attentions.Which brings us round to that controversial rape scene which while nowhere near as graphic as the violence is nevertheless exceedingly unpleasant in what it implies. The rape was not in the novel, so why was it included for the screen adaptation? It has an unusual bearing on the story and our reading of the final outcome. We the audience witness the rape and thus have more cause to see the village lads as detestable and deserving of their fate. Hoffman's character however remains unaware of it, which means his violent retribution is purely on grounds of defending Niles and his home. But the fact we know that two of these guys are rapists makes the violence seem righteous, even satisfactory to an audience. Couple this with the thrilling notion that Sumner is using his knowledge and wits to defeat their brute strength, as well as Peckinpah's knack for making action scenes so wonderfully dynamic, and the violence of Straw Dogs actually becomes exciting and enjoyable.Does this then mean that the film censors were right? In fact, both Peckinpah and the censors were wrong. Straw Dogs will not scare people off violence, nor will it attract them to it. We pick up our morality from real life, not from a cinema screen. Straw Dogs is not an effective message movie, and it is not a dangerous one. It is, quite simply, a decent work of entertainment. Enjoy it as one.</fullReview>

So they move to the countryside... only it becomes obvious to them and us that the country ain't so different from the city after all. Directed by Sam Peckinpah,(the wild bunch), and with Hoffman and George riveting, its a tale of violence repressed, that which is within all of us, what many of us hide... Its a harsh gritty unflinching piece that probably due to its content (several scenes will blow you away) has never got the credit it deserves, but folks there isn't anything like this at all in cinema - a genuine masterpiece of wrought iron tension. 10/10 David Ford</fullReview>

As for David's wife Amy she, while living in town before she met David, has a reputation of being a bit loose with the local boys in town. There's also Charlie Venner, Del Henney, who was Amy boyfriend and who, seeing how she filled out over the years, eagerly wants to restart his relationship with her! Even though Charlie knows that she's a married woman and wants absolutely nothing to do with him! Still Amy teases and entices Charlie &amp; Co, the boys in town, by going around bra-less and even flashing her will developed breasts at them just to get her nerdy husband David to square off and slug it out with Charlie and the boys. Amy is suspicious, with good reason, that Charlie and his friends, who are doing construction work at the house, killed her cat in an effort to intimidate both her and David and force then to leave town.David for the most part wants to be just one of the boys and goes out drinking at the local bar, even picking up the tab, as well as on hunting trip with them just to be sociable. Charlie uses that occasion, the hunting trip, to sneak back to David's house and together with his friend "Stormin' Normen" Scott, Ken Hutchison, gang rape Amy who's left traumatized by the event! What turns David, like Clark Kent changing into Superman, around is not that his wife was raped, he as far as I could see never found that out, but an incident he had with the local village idiot Henry Niles, David Warner.It was Henry who had accidentally killed teenager Janice Hedden, Sally Thomsett, earlier that evening while the two were making out in a deserted barn. Janice who had the hots for Henry threw herself at him with Henry, during all the excitement, ending up strangling her when the action, or sex, started to get out of control. Henry now on the run from the police ended up getting hit by David's car as he and Amy were driving home from a church banquet. David taking the injured Henry home to recuperate until help, the town doctor, arrives in the morning is just trying to do the right thing not interested, or knowing, what he just did. With the word out that Janice is missing, her body wasn't found yet, and her being last seen with that pervert Henry Niles her almost dead drunk dad, he seems to spend more time in the saloon then at home, Ted Hedden, Peter Vaughan, rustles up a lynch mob of outraged townspeople, including Charlie Venner &amp; "Stormin' Normen" Scott, to first capture Henry and then string him up without a trial! ***SPOILERS*** Gut crunching final with David taking on all comers-the Hedden lynch mob-in a mind boggling slug-fest at the barricaded Sumner farmhouse. Having been kicked around and humiliated in his being a gutless wimp by everyone, including his wife Amy, in the movie David finally let all, boiling oil fireplace pokers lead pipes and even bear-traps, his frustrations out with shattering results! And those results turned out to be a bloodbath of such enormous proportions that even that blood thirsty psycho "Jack the Ripper" would envy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Sumner is an American mathematician living with his wife Amy in an isolated English village. David struggles to fit in with the locals, one of whom is an old boyfriend of Amy's. When David shelters a retarded man who has attacked a girl, five men try to smash their way in. However, perhaps they have underestimated the quiet man ?Straw Dogs is the movie for anyone who thinks violence is in any way cool, glamorous or fun, because it presents it the way it should be; ugly, stupid and demeaning for all involved. That's not to say the movie is any of those things - it's not perfect, but it's an engrossing story, a brilliantly edited mixture of intriguing themes, and the last half-hour is one of the most nail-biting climaxes to any movie. The ideas are fascinating; why can't the locals accept David, why is Amy so childish, why does David feel obliged to protect Henry, where does David's resolve come from ? Peckinpah depicts these with brilliant visual motifs, like the contrast of the notorious rape scene with David shooting the bird on the moor. As with all his work, there's a poeticism to his images which transcends the vulgarity and the violence in the stories he tells. If you don't believe me, compare it with any of his many imitators (e.g. Michael Winner's Death Wish), which are often just nasty for the sake of it and don't take any time to explore the nature of violence. None of the cast are really very likable in this movie but everyone plays it well; George is pretty unforgettable in the controversial role of a lifetime, Hutchison is one of the scariest tough guys in British cinema (check him out also in Ladyhawke) and the ever-reliable Warner appears unbilled in the Lenny role. Written by David Zelag Goodman and Peckinpah, based on the novel The Siege Of Trencher's Farm, by Gordon M. Williams. This was an enforced but productive change of pace for Peckinpah, shot in Cornwall in south-west England, with an all-British cast and crew (except Hoffman), featuring great camera-work by John Coquillon. This is one of several movies right-wing institutions like to defame and ban, which is reason enough to see it, but it's really a fine example of the pressure-cooker plot which build up to an explosive finale, something cinema does very well when handled right. See it and think about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film reminds me of an anecdote I read about an interview with David Cronenberg concerning his film Crash. He was confronted with a statement that went something like: "This movie is disgusting. Watching it is like looking into a toilet." To which Cronenberg replied: "Well, if you want to know what's going on inside then that is what you must do."Straw Dogs can rightfully be called sexist, bigoted, nihilistic, gratuitously violent and several other negative things. Peckinpah explores these negative themes in a way that I think has no equal. The only character in this film that does not convey a destructive side of the human psyche is Amy. She's not an angel but is still the only ray of light in the forest of shadows. Caught in the middle of the ensemble of male pr*cks her character serves as a kind of catalyst for the story. The other main propellant is her self-righteous husband, David, who's concern with other people goes about as far as his glasses do.As the story unfolds and the dynamics of the characters are played out, we see one situation after another that is couped by the different character's pettiness and egotism. It all culminates in a needlessly violent fight between the locals, who ostensibly are looking for justice, and David who ostensibly is standing up for what he sees as right.There is however no justice or nobility anywhere near this culmination of events. The characters are using these things as excuses for playing out their own petty and selfish agendas. The motivations and tensions have been built up masterfully by Peckinpah throughout the film and ends in a tempest of dark, unrelenting and violent irony.Many people will say that this is a pessimistic film that takes a needlessly dark view of how humans behave. Well, that could be true, but sometimes... that is what you must do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A much better film in my opinion than the same director's THE WILD BUNCH. Not only is the arc of the film done so brilliantly but the whole psychological underpinning especially of the two major characters are turned completely topsy-turvy. Hoffman's character is especially interesting. The arc his character follows becomes predictable as it approaches the half way mark and his girl's constant teasing with its undertones of insecurity and doubt makes his transformation by the end into a kind of instrument of extreme violent revenge a self-fulfilling phantasmagorical prophecy.SPOILER ALERT! By the end, Hoffman realizes just how disdainful he has become with his girlfriend and her twisted mind and sense of values - that at least a part of his revenge fantasy was goaded on by her immoral and vicious behavior - and much more pride and confidence in himself than he ever thought he had. The defense of his home against the men who raped his wife and are now trying to kill him and his erstwhile charge, the retarded man who apparently accidentally and without premeditation, killed a young teenage girl in the village that was trying to seduce the man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There seems to be a lot of confusion concerning the true meaning that Peckinpah was trying to communicate in this movie. Well here it is and it's simple, some people are straw dogs, they bark a lot and they look mean but the real mean dogs, who are loyal and brave fighting dogs can sometimes look very meek and act that way until they are pushed too far. Dustin Hoffman plays the meek mild intellectual who's wife is unfaithful to him and who has to do the right thing in protecting an intellectually challenged murderer from a lynch mob and he does it all by himself. Quite literally he is pushed too far and out pops the heroic doggy hidden beneath his civilized exterior, and now you straw dogs your days are numbered. Great flick that will leave you thinking about it for a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peckinpah's tribute to Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why have so many viewers found this film so offensive? Because it shows the West country farm-boys of England for the brute thugs that they really are.All right, that's crude; but that's really what this film is about: "The barbarians are not at the gates, they built the gates! - now what are we going to do about it?" - at which point, the film ends, and leaves us with the question.This film is simply not as violent as is frequently reported. What it is. is unrelenting. Peckinpah grabs his theme by the throat and won't let go.He's aided by superb performances from both cast and crew. It is remarkable that Peckinpah (at his best) always seems to manages to turn his cast into an ensemble. And notably there are none of his usual ensemble players (e.g. Oates and Johnson) present. Yet the cast performs as if they've known each other for years.By the way: although Peckinpah frequently cited John Huston as a major influence, this film really owes an awful lot to Hitchcock. I strongly suggest viewing Hitchcock's's early British films (esp. Blackmail) before seeing this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good movie. Dustin Hoffman plays an early violent role (for the money), as the tormented and misunderstood mathematician.It takes a little while, but David Sumner (Hoffman) and his wife, Amy (Susan George) are finally completely rattled in their supposed-to-be vacation home. The visit starts out only mildly unnerving, and nobody likes David, perhaps because he's a little too geeky for the town. Furthermore, his wife stops liking him as much as she used to, as he becomes more and more enveloped in his work. Things will come to a head as David has to face the brutal townsfolk with little help at all in a great moment of truth.Hoffman gives his all in this one, as he does in most of his movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Straw Dogs" is still an enjoyable and thought provoking film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: LARGE PART OF PLOT Reveled Director Sam Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch" (1969) was one of the most controversial films ever made for its time and is still be considered violent today. Plot progression was dealt with quickly but the violence was carefully elongated to create full pitched battles with shocking blood letting. Most of the violence was filmed in slow motion, even when civilians were caught up in it. Death was no longer reserved for the "bad-guys" dressed in black. Every character was portrayed in different shades of gray. Also, Peckinpah used great dialogue and characterization so that combined with the performances of excellent actors (William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Warren Oates, Ben Johnson, Edmond O'Brien, Robert Ryan) he managed to pull together not a mindless gore-fest, but a picture that spoke of loyalty between friends and honor in death. It was one of the greatest movies of all time.Two years later Peckinpah directed "Straw Dogs". Although it, too, can be considered violent and it was definitely controversial (banned in the UK), "Straw Dogs" is a slight disappointment. It's set in a small town in rural England which becomes the new home of American David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman) and his British wife Amy (Susan George). Together they are trying to escape the violence of American society and decide to settle down in Amy's peaceful hometown where David can find the time he needs to write his book on "stellar interiors and their radiation characteristics". The details on what he does are very vague. All that Peckinpah wants us to know is that David is one of society's intellectual elite. Of course, to follow the cliché when it comes to nerds in thrillers, David is portrayed as a coward without a spine. The locals soon begin to dislike David since his mannerisms seem alien to them. The situation deteriorates faster because one of the locals, Charlie Venner (Del Henney) was once Amy's boyfriend and is obviously jealous of David.The Sumner's move into Amy's father's old house and hire several men to repair the roof on their garage. Slowly the men (Charlie among them) begin to harass the two and invade their privacy. It gets worse as their actions become more sadistic and abusive. The tensions finally break one night when David is trying to protect the village idiot from an angry mob. Janice, the daughter of an uncontrollable drunk (also related to Charlie), was seen walking home one night with the idiot (who has a shady past when it comes to the safety of young girls) but then disappears. David, while driving home from a community event, accidentally hits the idiot and finds that it's his responsibility to take care of him at home. The drunk gathers together a mob and tries to manhandle the idiot into telling him where Janice is. David sums up his courage and decides to be a man, taking on a "my house is my castle" mentality. A bloody siege ensues.Similar to "The Wild Bunch", "Straw Dogs" has many of Peckinpah's trademarks. It opens to a scene of children torturing a dog ("The Wild Bunch" opened to the same thing except the dog was a scorpion). Both films end in bloody climaxes. The script for "Straw Dogs" has well developed characters (right up to the last twenty minutes) and there is an excellently created atmosphere that helps deliver a sense of uneasiness with each line delivered by the outstanding cast. The differences between Amy and David, along with the harassment of the locals, all creates an almost unbearable tension. Amy is a lighthearted and beautiful young woman who acts so immature it's childish, and David is a selfish, solitary workaholic afraid of taking risks. The surrounding characters are all stupid, rude farmers with the exception of the local magistrate. All is perfectly set for the climax. Actually, the setup is so simple it's a little predictable. From there the movie goes further downhill. Peckinpah showed his talent for directing violent climaxes in "The Wild Bunch", but in "Straw Dogs" the violence is so long it's silly. The mob circles the Sumner home trying to break in. The doors are thick oak reinforced with steal, so it would seem sensible to go through the windows. No, that would shorten the action so they mill about for a while destroying the property. All is plausible since they're drunk, but a minute before they were sober and on a mission to save a young girl. Plausibility comes into question. It's all for violence's sake, which in the process cheapens the movie.Besides these flaws "Straw Dogs" is an enjoyable motion picture with a different message than that of "The Wild Bunch's". In the latter, criminals past their prime go down with guns blazing to save their friend, proving their honor amongst thieves. It portrayed the "bad guys" as honorable but the "good guys" as greedy railroad barons. It showed that no man can be classified as either "black" or "white". We're all gray and everyone has sinned, it just matters whose shoes you're in whose eyes you see things through. "Straw Dogs", however, is about one man's personal transformation in order to protect his abused dignity. As the tag-line says, "The knock at the door meant the birth of one man and the death of seven others." "Straw Dogs" is still an enjoyable and thought provoking film. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Appreciation of this movie seems to depend on just how far you're willing to stretch a metaphor.It is possible, for example, to read the character of David as a representation of liberal American idealism; an educated professional, a bit of a geek, something of a social outcast, who while supporting the student protests sweeping the country, doesn't have the balls to actively join them. He witnesses atrocities like the killings at Kent State but doesn't want to get involved. As a result, he flees the country in fear and disgust to a foreign rural idyll where he hopes that he can live his life quietly with his head in the sand (or in a book) and never be forced to actually stand up and fight for something.David's English wife, Amy, represents the loose living hedonism of the period; an individual who on the surface is all rebellious and anti-authoritarian, the kind of person who would happily jump in to join the protesters just to shock her family and friends, but would be the first to give in and run crying for help when the sh*t really hits the fan.And so you have these two people ? desperate and self-delusional - holed up in a ramshackle Cornish farmhouse trying to pretend that nothing in the world exists, let alone matters. When they are besieged by the forces or irrational, howling hatred, they are forced to make a decision; capitulate or fight.The entire movie, therefore, becomes a metaphor of Nixon-era social-politics. A savage indictment not only of bigotry and violence, but of the liberal pacifist refusal to combat such evil.The script, however, is often awkward, the supporting actors erratic at best, the cinematography is bland, and the editing has all the choppy hallmarks of inexperience. The lead performances from Hoffman and George are exceptional, though, with incredible range, complexity and subtlety. Not a single moment passes by when their faces aren't a turmoil of contradicting emotions and motivations, and it's a mystery why neither received ANY award recognition.Overall, 'Straw Dogs' is another fascinating, albeit nihilistic, insight into the paranoid, fearful, angry and injured American psyche of the early seventies.Be warned: Those viewers who are unable to stretch the metaphor to such lengths, will find the entire movie an ugly, senseless and depressing exercise in tedium.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Straw dogs" has to be one of the most pressuring films of the early 1970's. If this is not a horror movie I don't know what is. Actually it nearly reminds me of all those legendary zombie flicks like "Night of the living dead", only difference is that it's more horrifying because there really aren't any zombies now is there? The atmosphere of the movie is extremely nightmarish, the famous rape scene shocks every time and the blood splattering ending makes you almost want to scream. This creepy little violent masterpiece is certainly Sam Peckinpah's biggest classics and definitely a must-see for everyone who wants to learn more about his famous style. Young Dustin Hoffman shines in one of the most memorable performances of his career. When you've seen "Straw dogs" once you'll never forget it. Even though the film is only fiction, English countryside doesn't look like a very romantic place to visit after this.</fullReview>

One may argue all he wants with the director's philosophy, but the fact remains: Sam Peckinpah is one of the most unique filmmakers America ever produced. At his time, he successfully forced people from all the walks of life to argue with him. Now, he is remembered by few-and yet, his life was not lived in vain. Because of his refusal to compromise his vision, he remains as a sort of a subconscious presence in the minds of those who did bother to familiarize themselves with his creative output. of all his films, "Straw Dogs" is the best one. One must see it, if only for a chance to argue with a very different but a very personal philosophy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>6/10CONTAINS SPOILERSHoffman contributes one of his finest performances and Peckinpah provides his usual intelligent direction. The violence is shocking but not as graphic as Kubrik's "A Clockwork Orange" from the same year (1971). Possibly the main reason that the film caused so much offence on its release (it was subsequently banned in the UK for 25 years) is its neolithic sexual politics - particularly the ambiguous "rape" scene.Hoffman plays David Sumner, a quiet and passive mathematician locked in an intricate power struggle with his English wife Amy (Susan George). The couple have recently moved to the remote Cornish village where Amy was brought up, ironically to escape the potential for violence in America. During the first half of the film, we see the couple playing a series of chess games, which Peckinpah uses to symbolize the constant mind-games the couple are playing. Although playful, each "player" is intent on gaining the upper hand, with Amy seemingly winning each time.David also has to contend with a group of local villagers who seem intent on making his life miserable and are responsible for a series of unpleasant acts designed to unsettle him. Perhaps the worst thing for David is that his wife seems to encourage the attentions of the group when they start leering at her. By the end of the film, the relentless provocation from all sides finally pushes David to breaking point as he embarks on an unforgettable spree of violence.Sumner's transition from mild-mannered husband to ruthless murderer is sudden rather than gradual. His explosive outburst is simply the result of not being able to stand the frustration and humiliation welling up inside him any longer. Peckinpah's triumph is his manipulation of the audience to such an extent that even the most refined viewer is acquiesced to rooting for David as he is reduced to behaving in a way that goes against everything he (and a civilized society) stands for. No matter how much we think we have progressed, the primal instinct of violence is still buried somewhere inside every man.The film is generally well-acted and Jerry Fielding was nominated for an Oscar for a compelling score. However, Straw Dogs is let down by a slow beginning and the lengthy final scene may be a bit too gratuitous for some people's tastes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very compelling film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read about this movie being controversial during its time period, as well as some great reviews from major critics. I'm always interested in a movie that generates controversy, so I checked it out and I was very impressed. Sure, it's not an "excellent" film, but it's well-done, well-acted and quite thought-provoking. Dustin Hoffman gives a fine early performance and so does the beautiful actress Susan George. What I appreciated about the film is that each character was flawed in his/her own way. Though Hoffman's character is the protagonist, we don't perfectly sympathize with him. He's a workaholic, he doesn't pay enough attention to his wife's problems. And though I can tell his wife wants attention, she can be a little too intrusive at times. I even noticed during the rape scene his wife felt torchered, yet she wasn't totally resisting. When the first guy leaned over to kiss her, she kissed him back. I know for sure if a woman--no matter how small or frail she is--will get the strength from hell to shove that man off if she knew he was trying to rape her. I'm not saying that she enjoyed being raped, but in a way she craved the attention, which she wasn't getting from her husband. In one scene, she stands in front of the window topless, while the three guys are outside looking in, and looks perfectly comfortable like she's putting on a show for them. *POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD*The final act posed an interesting dilemma. Hoffman wanted to help an injured man, who's accused of raping and murdering the daughter of a local. He wants to wait for a doctor to come. Meanwhile, the girl's father and the group of thugs destroy Hoffman's house, trying desperately to get inside, because they want to make sure this injured man is dead. But Hoffman's so committed at helping this man that he's willing to chuck his pacifist ways and fight back. It reminds of the line from "A Bronx Tale": "Yeah, you did a good thing. You did a good thing for a bad guy." I know if I were in Hoffman's shoes, I would've handed the man over and let him die. As long as I'm not the one putting a bullet in his head, I'm no murderer. Hell, he could've saved himself the agony of having these lowlifes pulverize his house if he only let the man go. His wife is obviously in intense disagreement with him. Though I don't agree with Hoffman's decision, it presented an interesting "What if" question for the audience to answer. I haven't seen any of Peckinpah's other works, so I have no grounds for comparison, but it's definitely an intense film, even for today's standards. It's just not a film for the squeamish. As well as some disturbing rape scenes, there are flashes of graphic violence towards the end. My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very disturbing. Not just visually, but emotionally as well. It is sometimes hard for me to understand what are the intensions in some scenes, whether if it is to just shock the viewers or actually trying to send across a message. The infamous rape scene is not graphic, it is disturbing in another sense. I don't know if I totally agree with Sam's directions, but I feel that this movie is a good social/character comment. This controversial film I think as a whole is a message against violence and rape, although it also suggests a very fundamental problem of mankind. We still cannot, no matter how hard we try or fast we run away from the animal conditions that exist within all of us. Philosophy is a rich man's sport. When it comes down to poverty and desperation, one will inevitably level back to the animal conditions one knows so well. Whether if it is for desires, physical satisfactions or emotional stability. If one lives among animals, no matter how intelligent or sophisticated one is, inorder to survive, one will have to act like an animal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Straw Dogs is an exceptional film with a strong message.Straw Dogs makes the point that men who are governed solely by their intellect or "reason" can lose their effectiveness in the world and lose their women, because they don't have enough passion; their passion, when finally awakened, can change the world in ways their reason could not do.Straw Dogs also makes the point that passionate men might seem to rule the world, and gain a woman's favor, yet if they are uncivil they will come to justice at the hand of rightousness. Passion versus reason, reason versus passion. Is one better than the other? Should they coexist? It's a classic question. Straw Dogs hits those themes strongly, graphically, with no holds barred. Well done!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nerve-shredding, palm-sweating masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never before have I seen such a film which builds up the tension like this. Peckenpah slowly builds it up for over an hour before Hoffman is pushed too far and all Hell breaks loose. By the end of the film the audience has been forced through an orgy of violence, tension and, of course, rape. It's a shame that when people think of this film the only thing which comes to mind is the rape scene. This sequence, which is the reason why it's still banned in the U.K, is completely irrelevant. Having read the book, which is very good by the way, there is no scene equivalent in it, to the rape in `Straw Dogs'. Personally I can see no point to it, and it should have been cut. But even with it, Peckenpah has made a thrilling masterpiece which is un-like any of his other work. It cleverly combines elements taken from the western genre, suspense films, thrillers and the gothic horror genre. I just can't wait for the day it makes it's U.K debut on home video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently watched this movie, after buying it, and I didn't expect nothing different of Deliverance.John Booorman's movie and Sam Peckinpah's film have a lot of points in common and both was shot in the early seventies, but the most evident and bright of them is that both studied the common men's behavior when they have to face something that is beyond their control. Deliverance showed this in a shocking, brutal way, but before it, Sam Peckinpah directed this masterpiece, counting with all his experience. In Straw Dogs, all Peckinpah's techniques comes to the screen: slow motion, psychological tension, violence and quick edition.Dustin Hoffman plays a coward and weak mathematics professor who moves with his wife to an English village, and who has to prove his manhood when the locals start to insult them.Straw Dogs is a little slow in the beginning, but when it finally gets on its tracks, the film turns into a thrilling ride of a man who will do everything to protect his family.As already shown in The Wild Bunch, there is no one who can be so cruel and realistic as Sam Peckinpah...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A robust and brutal masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loved and hated in equal measures and banned for almost twenty years because of a brutal rape scene; you can say what you want about Sam Peckinpah's violent thriller Straw Dogs, but undeniably the film is very powerful. Sam Peckinpah made The Wild Bunch in 1969; a film that has gone down in history as one of the most violent westerns ever made. But while that film shown the violence head on; Straw Dogs broods and makes the audience think before delivering its shocks; and the result is much more powerful, as not only will you be shocked by what you're seeing on screen but you will be forced to think about it also. The film is based on a novel by Gordon Williams and focuses on David and Amy Sumner. He's an American mathematician and she's a former country girl; and together they move to the Cornish countryside so he can concentrate on his latest book. Upon arriving they are given a cold reception from their new neighbours. However, the frostiness soon turns sour as the locals turn to physical violence directed at both the man and his wife.Dustin Hoffman takes the lead role and is absolutely perfect as the quaint American trying to ignore his troubles. Hoffman has given a number of great performances in his career; but for me this is the best. There's never ant doubt that he is the character he is playing and the film would not be anywhere near as good without him in it. The perky Susan George is his opposite number and performs well in a role that includes some unpleasant scenes. The atmosphere that Peckinpah creates in the small English town is completely overpowering and it's very easy to completely understand the fear felt by the lead characters. The film is famous for its rape scene and while it's not as visceral as the ones seen in some other films; it's extremely unpleasant and Peckinpah manages to force the audience into deciding whether or not the victim actually 'deserved' it, which is far more shocking than anything we actually see on screen. The film is famous for its violence; but the violence actually doesn't feature strongly until the conclusion. By then, we are completely at ease with the characters and the situation - which makes it all the more shocking. The final forty minutes of this film are among the most tense I've ever seen and ensures the film ends on a pulsating high. The central characters are the most important thing about it, however, and the film doesn't delight in its violence; it's simply there as a means to an end in the development of the lead character. Overall, Straw Dogs is a violent masterpiece and a film that has to be seen by anyone who considers themselves a film fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful, intense meditation on the allure and repulsion of violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American astrophysicist David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman) is a wimpy pacifist who grows tired of the strife and violence raging across America. Along with his pretty young wife, Amy (Susan George), he travels to George's hometown in Cornwall, England. Sumner quickly finds that beneath the idyllic scenery and veneer of small-town friendliness lie a clannish society based on violence and exclusion-ism. A group of townspeople begin playing a series of increasingly vicious pranks on David and Amy, culminating in Amy's rape by two of the more repulsive townspeople (Del Henney and Ken Hutchison). Things still continue on, until David takes in the village idiot, Harry Niles (David Warner), after hitting him with a car and tries to save him from a mob who saw him abduct a young girl. David tries to sort the situation out peacefully, but before long he finds himself resorting to violence to defend himself and his home."Straw Dogs" is an amazingly powerful film, and a widely misunderstood one as well. Critics who seem unable to analyze films on anything but surface meaning accuse it of glamorizing sadism and violence; feminists harp on the film's rape scene and the portrayal of Amy, denouncing the film as a chauvinist fantasy. Both readings of the film are wholly off-base. Although perhaps not as deep as some of Sam Peckinpah's other works, it's easily his best shy of "The Wild Bunch", and deals with a deep (and disturbing) topic: humanity's lust for and glorification of violence and death.Say the name Sam Peckinpah to anyone and what comes to mind? In pretty much every instance, the answer is violence. Graphic violence, slow-motion shoot-outs with bright red blood spurting out of bullet wounds. This is a simplistic way to look at Peckinpah; in his best work (Ride the High Country, The Wild Bunch) he created deep themes and well-rounded characters worthy of a classic novel or play. Even some of his weaker efforts, like Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid and Cross of Iron, have interesting ideas to present, even if not entirely successful. But, it is certainly true that violence - its effects, its terror, its place in society, and, most of all, social enjoyment of it - is a central theme of Peckinpah's films. Merely judging "Straw Dogs" on the fact that it IS violent is childish and simplistic; it's much more fruitful to address WHY Peckinpah opted to make it violent, and what he's trying to say."Straw Dogs" is perhaps the ultimate distillation of Peckinpah's views on violence. Peckinpah was an ardent fan of Robert Ardrey, the playwright-anthropologist who hypothesized that humans are inured to violence by instinctual urges rather than social pressure or upbringing. This is a very hard view to argue with, for in spite of hypocritical denunciation of violence in the media, the raging street violence, crime, warfare, and violent action movies, TV shows and video games, indicates that the human race thrives on and revels in killing - no matter how much we may like to think otherwise."Straw Dogs" endorses Ardrey's world-view: the people of our out-of-the-way hamlet are easily driven to violence, their sins mostly overlooked by the hypocritically pious town leaders. Even a pacifist like David Sumner is not immune to the allure of murder; his claims of standing up principle (defending Niles, the murderous village idiot, from a mob) are dubious at best. The film has been read as a revenge fantasy a la Death Wish, which is ridiculous; Amy doesn't even tell David about the rape. Rather, it's a cumulative revenge; a man stuck in a small town with no friends, fed up with violence in his own culture, his taunting and torment here, his unhappy marriage to his wife, and his own weakness, allows his long-repressed rage to explode. In the end, even David Sumner is capable of horrific violence; not only that, he enjoys it. And the sheer visceral thrill of watching vile bad guys get handed their just deserts implicates us in the violence as well; none of us are innocent, and all of us are guilty.Peckinpah's direction is effective, presenting violence in all its glory and horror; he succeeds at showing an externally beautiful but inwardly hideous small town. The cast is good, if unspectacular: Dustin Hoffman embodies David Sumner as impotent professor and makes his transition frighteningly believable. Susan George is quite good as Amy, the confused, repressed young girl who married a guy who isn't right for her. The supporting cast is adequate, with T.P. McKenna and Del Henney giving the strongest performances as the well-meaning but ineffectual Sheriff and the most sympathetic of David and Amy's tormentors.Straw Dogs is a powerful, disturbing mediation on violence, with a power and force that few films a possess. It is a true masterpiece.10/10</fullReview>

'Straw Dogs' is the story of a man and wife who move to Britain to escape the rampant violence in America. Hoffman plays David Sumner, a mathematician and pacifist who is overseeing the construction of he and his wife's new home. After months of being bullied and taken advantage of by a group of locals, David Sumner loses his cool. This amazing film is the story of what happens when you push a peaceful man too far.

		<shortDescription>The films of Sam Peckinpah: How far will a man go to protect what's his?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Straw Dogs (1971) was a film that Sam Peckinpah directed during the early seventies. He adapted the screenplay from the thriller novel "The Siege at Trencher's Farm). Dustin Hoffman stars as David Sumner, a mild mannered American Mathmatician who moves to the English countryside with his wife Amy (Susan George). David has resettled to not only work on his book but to get away from the violence and turmoil that's going on in the "States". But the small town also happens to be the hometown of Amy. All of her old friends and lovers watch her showing off her well-to-do husband. The natives view David as a mealy mouth push over and clown on him all the time.During the coming weeks, the bullying and insulting from Amy's lovers gradually gets to David. He can see how they treat him and his wife, but being a push over he does nothing but shrugs it off. He also notices a change in his wife's demeanor after a dangerous encounter with her former boyfriend who rapes her when David is partying with his "friends". He knows something traumatic has happened to her, but he still does nothing. All this changes one day when the village idiot Niles (an uncredited David Warner) accidentally kills a local girl. Seeking refuge from a group of vigilantes, the man turns to David. He does the only thing a kind person like him would do. Take in and protect Niles. The angry father and his buddies receive word of his where about and surround the home demanding that David release Niles.David refuses, he wont hand him over to a ruthless mob that most certainly will kill Niles. He states that this is his home and he'll defend it no matter what the consequences are. This change in David scares his wife who pleads with him to give up Niles. After keeping her in check, he proceeds to defend the homestead. The father and his goons break in and David fends them off with his homemade traps and trusty shotgun. To him, it's not about what Niles did or why they even want him in the first place. This is David's home and whoever's trespasses will be dealt a severe case of lead poisoning. After a brutal fight with the last two home invaders, David learns about his wife's rape from one of the invaders. Manning up, David and the rapist go at it one-on-one. After the smoke clears, all of the trespassers are dead and Amy's rapist have paid the ultimate price. A triumphant Davis takes Niles away. He has finally stood up an become a man.For years people have been trying to figure this movie out. I have one simple explanation. The story is about a spineless man who one day just has enough of being pushed around and unleashes his pent of rage and anger towards his tormentors. No man can take that much abuse without delivering some pay back (according to Peckinpah). Others might disagree. Just how far will a man go to protect his home? Pretty far when it's all that he has left to call his own.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sam Peckinpah's Brilliant Study of Psychosexual Turmoil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Heaven and earth are not humane, and regard the people as straw dogs." Lao-tzu,Chinese philosopher Dr. David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman) a brilliant young mathematician working on a scientific research grant, has traveled from America to the English Countryside near the village where his sensuous wife Amy (Susan George) grew up. David's stated purpose for moving is to find the peace, quiet and privacy to work on such complicated mathematics. However, David's real purpose is to escape the turmoil and violence of the late 60s United States, with it's demonstrations, riots and urban violence. However, David soon discovers he cannot escape turmoil and danger. It's everywhere: the pubs, the streets, the school yards, and, most importantly,inside himself.Within this framework, and the novel "The Siege at Trencher's Farm," screenwriter David Zelig Goodman and director Sam Peckinpah have fashioned a violent, suspenseful and often brilliant study of psycho-sexual turmoil. Each character represents some aspect of human nature. The Major (constable) represents authority and implied order. The Vicar represents organized religion, with all of its worldly shortcomimgs. Janice (Sally Thomsett), the young woman attracted to David represents youthful curiosity and feminine desire. Tom Hedden (Peter Vaugn), Janice's father, represents uncontrolled rage and mob mentality. Charlie (Del Henney) and Chris (Jim Norton) represent the light and dark sides of unsuppressed masculinity. The rat killer represents madness, and his mocking nature reminds us how close madness really. Henry Niles (David Warner), the mentally challenged man whose unintentional actions set the bloody siege in motion, represents innocence; which, with all its good intentions, can do great harm if unchecked by reason and caution. WARNING: SPOILERS David and Amy are also symbols, though they don't represent individual characteristics of psyche as they do two sides of a healthy, cohesive personality. David is dominated by reason, with it's prudent caution. Amy is dominated by emotion, with its spontaneity and willingness to take risks. Both David and Amy possess these characteristics and more. Since a healthy personality needs ALL these characteristics in proper balance, David's generally repressed emotions and Amy's repressed reason draw turmoil out of the environment. Their fear and uncertainty, which provoked David to leave the US, in particular, draws rage, humiliation and violence to them, for predators can smell fear. Most importantly, fearful people unconsciously act in manners which draw predators and violent situations to them.Only once David and Amy face ALL their emotions and self-doubts and prevail, do they progress hopefully toward the future. It's very significant that Amy saves David from the last attacker, demonstrating her emotions have finally been conquered by reason and courage. David expresses this most clearly in the last scene, as David drives Henry Niles home.Henry (CONFUSED): "I don't know my way home." David (SMILING, ENTHUSIASTIC): "Neither do I." END OF SPOILERS "Straw Dogs" is a violent, suspenseful and slightly gruesome motion picture. It's is also nothing short of brilliant in it's depiction of the cost of "controlling" one's emotions and hiding from responsibility for the sometimes, brutal consequences. It is nothing short of brilliant. I give "Straw Dogs" a "10".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Muddled, incoherent and leaves a sour taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Straw Dogs' is one of a number of controversial British films of the early 1970s (others include `A Clockwork Orange' and `Get Carter') which started a national debate about censorship and the portrayal of violence in the cinema. At the centre of the film are David Sumner, a young American academic and his British wife Amy. David and Amy have left America to live in Amy's native village in the English West Country, hoping to find a quieter, more peaceful way of life. Their hopes, however, are to be cruelly disappointed. The local residents take a dislike to David and begin a campaign of harassment against the couple. Things come to a head one foggy night when the couple's car hits and injures Henry Niles, a mentally retarded villager. David and Amy take Niles back to their farmhouse in order to call a doctor to treat him, unaware that he has killed a local girl named Janice (either accidentally or otherwise). A lynch-mob led by Janice's father arrives at the house, demanding that the couple surrender Niles to them. David refuses, and when the mob tries to storm his house, he decides to fight back, meeting the mob's fury with a brutality of his own.It has been stated that `Straw Dogs' is not just a violent film but also a film about violence. Like a number of other films of the period, it depicts violent acts in a graphic way in order to pose fundamental questions about the social and psychological roots of violence and about its effects on society. There is, however, a difference between it and the two other films mentioned above. `Get Carter' and `Clockwork Orange' both deal with people for whom violence is a way of life, either professional gangsters or hardened hooligans. `Straw Dogs' deals with what happens when otherwise peaceful people turn violent; the inhabitants of a previously tranquil village turn into a raging mob, and a mild-mannered academic resists them with a cold, clinical ruthlessness.The film's main weakness is that it never makes these events seem really plausible. The locals seem to dislike David for a number of reasons, including a distrust of all outsiders, especially foreigners, and envy of his success and comparative wealth. Sexual jealousy also plays a part; although not particularly physically attractive, he has nevertheless won in marriage the most attractive girl from the village. One of the mob, Charlie Venner, is a former lover of Amy's, and several of the others would have liked to have been. These factors while they might give rise to simmering resentment, are not normally enough to provoke murderous fury, and the Niles plot (lifted from Steinbeck's `Of Mice and Men') was introduced to provide a motive for the mob to attack David's house.Unfortunately, however, this gives rise to further difficulties. It is, of course, a truism that the mildest of men is likely to resort to violence in order to protect his own life or that of a loved one, but David is never placed in that position. It is quite clear that he and Amy will be spared if Niles is handed over. It is, I feel, a very unusual man who, in order to protect a suspected murderer from vigilante justice, will turn on the vigilantes with sadistic fury, placing both himself and his wife in grave danger by so doing. There is nothing in the film which helps to explain why David, the puny, bespectacled academic should react in such a way. Moreover, it is clear that when the mob attack the house Janice's body has not been found, so they do not actually know that she is dead or that Niles has killed her; at that stage she is merely missing, so their desire for vengeance seems less credible. If the body had been found before these scenes take place, the mob's anger against Niles and anyone sheltering him would have been more understandable, but David's determination to protect the guilty man would have seemed all the more irrational.Another weakness in the film is its treatment of women. There are only two main female characters in the film, Amy and Janice, and both are shown provoking or colluding in their own sexual degradation or destruction. Janice is shown flirting provocatively with Niles, although he is known to be mentally unstable and suspected of being a dangerous pervert. In the infamous rape scene, Amy is forced into sex by Venner, but later appears to be deriving pleasure from the experience. I can well understand why feminists took such objection to this scene, and find those attempts that have been made to defend it unconvincing. Peckinpah's general outlook strikes me as being one of bleak misanthropy, but even in this context his view of female sexuality comes across as demeaning and misogynistic.I also disliked the view of country life given in the film. Certainly, country people in Britain, especially those from the West Country, are well used to being patronised by metropolitan sophisticates, but the savage caricature in this film goes well beyond the normal stereotypes of ignorant, slow-witted, straw-chewing yokels. Peckinpah seems to have imported into a British setting the American urban elite's view of the rural working class as violent, sexually perverted white trash.There are better things about the film. Although the first half is fairly slow moving, the scenes of the attack on the house are well handled, and Dustin Hoffman gives a convincing portrayal of both David the respectable academic and David as transformed into the violent fanatic. Susan George as Amy is able to suggest both a certain innocence and sexual desirability. There is material here that could have been part of a good action thriller. Peckinpah, however, clearly had an ambition to go beyond this and to make a statement about society. In my view he failed in this ambition. Whereas `Get Carter' offers us a clear-eyed condemnation of the criminal lifestyle, and `Clockwork Orange' is a masterly examination of the themes of good, evil and free will, `Straw Dogs' is a muddled, incoherent film that leaves a sour taste in the mouth. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deliverance in Cornwall!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were three reasons to why this was banned in the U.K. Like Deliverance with rednecks, it made cornish people seem nasty and dumb. Then there's the rape scene which is rather tame by todays standards and baring in mind I've seen this movie uncut. There is also the death of Charlie Venner when Dustin Hoffman sets a bear trap over his head. The story involves Hoffman playing David Sumner, a mathematician who moves to Cornwall with his wife Amy to get away from the crime of New York. They meet Charlie Venner who was a boyfriend of Amy's. Hoffman hires him and a bunch of cornish folk to fix his garage up. After an hour of this movie you have grown to know the characters and love and hate the characters. You grow to hate the cornish folk who mock David and laugh behind his back. They even go and rape Amy while Hoffman's out snipe hunting. Someone has also murdered their cat, although by the end of the movie this is inconclusive to whom has done this. Finally Hoffman runs over Henry Niles, a village idiot played by an uncredited David Warner. After Hoffman takes Henry Niles home, the angry cornish folk come to take Henry and kill him. In the process while they break Hoffmans windows and kill the magistrate, Hoffman decides that he's going to fight back. In Sam Peckinpah style, limbs are blown off and the violence is absolutely brutal. By the end Hoffman has killed all of them. He is satisfied. He takes Henry Niles home. The movie is fantastic in exploring characters feelings and emotions. Charlie venner calls Amy 'Mrs Sumner' implying that he is mocking her, for she belongs to Hoffman now and not himself. The folk use their manners saying 'please' and 'thank you' to really hide the fact that they are much darker and inbred. Hoffman chickened out and trembling by the fact that his worst fear of crime has come back to kill him and make him suffer. Hoffman satisfied because he has beat this fear and ultimately killed it. The movie itself doesn't belong to a genre. But horror and thriller is the closest as it uses fog and darkness. Scenes are reminiscent of horror and thriller such as 'Night of the living dead' and 'Assault on Precinct 13'. Dustin Hoffman gives a strong and realistic performance as David Sumner and the rest of the cast do well to make him feel like trash. It's chilling and it's a really good movie. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT FOR LIBERALS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Straw Dogs is a complexly layered thematic film involving issues such as the true nature of violence, masculinity, territoriality and above all, the price we have to pay for displaying these naked emotions. But it's also an unbearably tense, gripping thriller. David Sumner retreats to rural Cornwall, to get away from street violence in America, only to find out that it exists in every place in the world, only in a different guise. The 'locals' (inhabited, imbred 'scum') pick on David for two simple reasons- he is a foreigner (well, American) and that they fancy his wife (understandable- it's Susan George).What makes the climax so inevitably true to life is how the locals attitude towards David starts off as mild hostility and gradually degenerates into full blown violence, who look for any excuse to terrorise David, his wife and his home. Much has been said about the rape scene, which, in this complete version is actually far less offensive. But what people don't often realise is that the two characters involved (Amy, David's wife and a scumbag local, Charlie) is that they already have a history together. Of course, rape is still rape and it is very shocking, even by todays standards, but considering that the two characters involved are far from being every day civilised human beings and are pretty screwed up- for them it may just be extremeley violent seduction, as when the second person rapes her-it appears that Amy does not enjoy this at all (this part was originally omitted from the cut version, which makes it's morals more ambiguous).Amy's feelings for Charlie (who for me isn't the definition of masculinity- more like an image of false macho, bouyish energy) have been so well hidden that the scene of violent seduction almost plays out as cartharsis, for both of them, which brings them rather oddly together (but as stated previousley, both are odd characters) and David is the only truly human person out of the lot (and more masculine than Charlie- he stands his ground when it needs to be stood- rather than resorting in false macho posturing).The fact that David is referred to as a coward by his wife says everything (does she have stronger feelings for Charlie because he projects himself to be more of a man? Typical!)- but he'll only fight back when its completely necassary, and when he does- well, see it for yourself. If any of this sounds like Fight Club, well, it must've been the equal, if not the surpassed version, released in 1971. Like most controversial films who are willing to make a bold statement, it all rings horribly true, which is probably what garners the respect of every artist, like Sam Peckinpah, to gain their status as a vital artist in their own medium.A MUST SEE for any film fan who likes their films to be bold rather than woossy, compromised tosh. Just don't show it to thick liberals, they'll never get it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I moved to the US over a year ago and was shopping in a DVD store one day and saw the infamous Straw Dogs there in front of me. I purchased it in great fear, certain that the assistant would see I was English and snatch it back from me. I am a Peckinpah fan and have loved his brutal, honest style for years. I watched Dogs on a pleasant afternoon and managed to bite off all my nails trying to cope with the building tension!! It is a stunning piece of film history and, although not Sam's best work, it is an IMPORTANT piece of cinema history. In my home country it is banned, totally. I know that the rape scene is the problem and I felt uncomfortable watching it BUT at least give people the choice to view it in their own homes. Censors argue that cutting the scene would damage Peckinpah's work but if they release it with the scene intact children might be damaged by it. What sort of parents would let their kids snuggle down and watch a Peckinpah film with them???!!! I dread the answer. Here, in the US, you can buy it (unrated) and watch it. If you have kids, lock the damned thing away. But at least give people the choice to watch what they want, when they want. I agree with the previous comment. Three generations are being cheated of a part of cinema history because some strangers in a room are being paid to make sure we are safe from some unproven, intangible evil that apparently spills into family life when unprotected. I love England but at least here in America, when you are of adult age, they treat you like a grown up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING SPOILERS MAY BE AHEAD Sam Peckinpah may just be the most sexist director in movie history. Alfred Hitchcock is a close second, but he just liked to humilate his female characters, wheras Peckinpah views them as man's downfall. Consider that most his female characters from THE WILD BUNCH to PAT GARRET AND BILLY THE KID to BRING ME THE HEAD OF ALFREDO GARCIA are all whores. The ones that aren't like Ali McGraw in THE GETAWAY, are willing to whore themselves to get what they want. In STRAW DOGS, Dustin Hoffman plays an American professor who moves to his wife's small England town to live peacefully. Unfortunatly, the local men, all of whom seem to know Hoffman's wife intimately, insult his masculinity and harass him constantly. Hoffman is terrfied by his attackers, but consider the reaction of his wife. When the attackers break into their house, to rape his wife, she goes along with it. There are no screams of terror or attempt to fight them off. Instead, she's a willing participant. The closing scenes in the film which are mercilessly violent, are therefore strange. Peckinpah has done something different here, along the lines of John Ford's THE SEARCHERS or Martin Scorsese's TAXI DRIVER. He's protecting a woman, who herself does not want to be protected. There is a difference however. This time, Hoffman is in danger too, something Wayne wasn't in SEARCHERS of DeNiro in TAXI DRIVER. Peckinpah has made a complex film, that challegnes his audience to evaluate everything they have seen in the movie carefully. Peckinpah was dismissed by feminist critics as sexist and vile, a man who hated women. This may well be true, but what interesting films he made on that theme. His women always love the main characters (remember the sad scene in ALFREDO GARCIA, where Oates' girlfriend is willing to be raped to protect him) yet they always seem like a lot of trouble. Peckinpah is a master film maker, and STRAW DOGS is one of his great works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peckinpah's second best film (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw "Straw Dogs" I didn't like it much. It seemed like the first boring hour existed only to set up a drunken bloodbath in it's last hour. After seeing it again I have to say, after "The Wild Bunch" this is Peckipah's 2nd best film. Even though the dialogue in the first hour is rather boring, there is much more going on under the surface than meets the eye. I don't see Hoffman's character as a coward, I see him as a man who hates violence and believes it is condescending to people who perform it. The only thing he seems comfortable with is his calculations on his blackboard. His wife is someone he really can't relate to very well, except sexually. She is beautiful though not particularly bright, or compassionate.Because of her jealousy towards the lack of attention he gives her as well as her disrespect for his "lack of manhood", she begins to flaunt herself to her old flame Charlie who is fixing their roof. He has all the masculine qualities that she lacks from her husband. I love the scene where she gets out of her car and clearly exposes her legs to the men and then pretends to be disgusted by the fact they were looking at her. This reaches an unhealthy climax when the men take her husband out hunting as a diversion so that Charlie can have time alone with her. Although she pretends to put up a struggle she clearly wants to have sex with him as he represents something she wants in her marraige. This was very controversial at the time because it seemed to suggest that she enjoyed being raped. In reality she was not raped, she was a willing participant. It was only when the second man attacks her that she is in fact raped. Only one of the men who attack his house at the end really has just cause, all of his friends see it as nothing but a joke and a bloodlust. The Hoffman character finally realizes that in order protect his home he has to stoop to the level of these people, by striking out at all of them (including his own wife). By the end we find that he is not a coward at all he is in fact the bravest and smartest person in the entire seige. His wife seems to respect him at the end, but he seems to not to respect her anymore. The final line of dialogue in this film he seems to indicate that because of the seige, his marriage is probably finished and he will never be the same again, for better or worse.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Listen to your wife and give her what she wants.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film encourages conversations around "what would YOU do if...". The rape scene is even more difficult to view, in light of all we ought to have learned about sexual assault. Hard to stomach Peckinpah's inference that she somehow asked for it, but it does illustrate how ambiguous these things can be. I had forgotten how powerful the scene where she saw her rapists at the church social is. It does show what it's like for a victim to have to walk among her attackers, and how long it can take for an attack to sink in. Many double entendres and good lines addressing the concept of masculinity and the role of violence. And the film is violent, though less graphic by today's standards. Strong sexual tension. I kept wanting to slap Hoffman's character, tell him to listen to his wife and to what she wants from him, then give it to her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most painful movie-watching experience of my life (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of Sam Peckinpah's 1971 film "Straw Dogs" is in reference to a type of ancient Chinese artifact that was worshiped, and then sacrificially burned. When seen in this context, the title makes perfect sense despite the fact that it is never mentioned by any of the characters. The movie is the story of how a normally meek, cowardly man "burns away" his personality and finds within himself the ability for violence and murder. When it was released, it was thrust to the forefront to the "violence in movies" debate alongside such films as "Dirty Harry" and "A Clockwork Orange." And it is, at times, quite violent. However, this film contains content that goes beyond mere violence to take it into another realm of shock. Watching "Straw Dogs" was the most painful viewing experience of my life. However, the fact that it is a necessary, important film is inescapable. Much has been made of how it is Peckinpah's statement on the nature of masculinity and manhood, complemented by his misogynistic, masochistic view of the world in general and women in particular. However, I believe there is another level it can be viewed on-that "Straw Dogs" is a nightmarish vision of the evil and beastial aspects inherent in every human being. It is a brutally harsh, cynical, and hateful cinema experience, routinely counted as one of the great disturbing movies along with films like "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover" and "Battle Royale." Most films side with one set of characters against another. "Straw Dogs" does not. It despises all of the participants in its drama, from the "protagonist" David Summer (Dustin Hoffman in one of the great roles in his long, wonderful career) and his vixen wife Amy (Susan George in a brave, powerful performance) to the group of inbred English miscreants (a European counterpart to the Mountain Men in "Deliverance") who terrorize them. Peckinpah holds all of these people in contempt, and the particularly sadistic ending purges them all, in one way or another, from the system. There are two famous disturbing sequences in the movie. The first is the rape of Amy by two of the English hoodlums. This scene starts off innocently enough, with Charlie, Amy's former boyfriend, appearing at the Summer cottage. It soon turns ugly, however, as Charlie hits Amy and forces her into submission. During the actual act, Peckinpah uses quick cuts to tell the story in implied images. The action becomes something more than rape, however, when quick cuts to Amy's face seem to suggest she is enjoying what is happening to her. This was HUGELY controversial, angering women around the world. However, in the next few moments we see Amy ravaged again by Scut, Charlie's friend. Her horrified reaction to this development draws the line and shows Amy as a real woman, not a sex-addict (as many critics claimed the scene suggested). This is even more appalling when we realize that David never finds out about his wife's rape at the hands of the men. The second violent scene is the 30-minute finale. David, inadvertantly protecting a simpleton-giant named Niles (who is guilty of a completely different crime) in his house, fights off the gang as they try to break in to get at the large man. In this sequence, men are killed with shotguns, beaten to death with fire pokers, and (in a truly startling moment) garroted with a bear trap. While fighting, David gets no help from his parasitic, immature wife-who has turned to Charlie as her protector. Only when he slaps her does Amy listen to David. Is Peckinpah suggesting violence is the only way to get respect? That's what many contend. Also, the only sympathetic character in the entire film, the Colonel, is shot dead in cold blood by one of the drunken mob. After the massacre, David drives Niles back into town. "I don't know my way home," the large man tells the American. "Neither do I," is David's chilling answer, a smile curling over his lips. This movie stares angrily in the void of the human soul. It is unlike any of Peckinpah's other films, because, while many are very violent, he usually looked on his characters (who were killers, robbers, and bounty hunters) and found warmth and humanity in them. With "Straw Dogs," he looked upon his subjects and found only perversion, sickness, and hate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Straw Dogs (1971)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1971, two of the most controversial films of all time were released within the same month. The first one, Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, was very successful and is often cited as one of the best American pictures ever made. The other, Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs, has slowly slipped away into the unknown, and the few times it HAS been cited seemed to have always revolved around its controversy rather than its content. Which is a shame, because Straw Dogs is not only one of the finest American films ever made, but one of the finest films ever made period. It is Peckinpah's masterpiece. It is a brutal, powerful film that challenges the viewer to contemplate not only his beliefs but the value of his own life. It epitomized the renaissance of film that took place during the six-year period from 1967 to 1973, and it captures the physical and emotional intensity only before seen in foreign films. In it, Dustin Hoffman plays a mathematician who has moved with his wife (played stunningly by Susan George) to her small hometown in England. It is heavily hinted at that they were pacifists and left the United States due to riots involving the Vietnam war. Once in England, they hire a few locals to work on the garage of their cottage, and after a series of horrifying events, David (Hoffman) is forced to confront his own convictions in a shattering climax that leaves him (and the viewer) even more perplexed than in the beginning. The film is shot in cold, gray tones that emit a hopeless feeling. A sense of dread, isolation, and desperation is conveyed in every frame. There is not a single comfortable or joyous scene to be found in the entire picture; even laughter seems ominous when filtered through Peckinpah's dark vision. All of this will most likely turn the viewer off to the movie ... and it should. Peckinpah doesn't want you to feel comfortable while watching Straw Dogs. He wants you to fidget in your seat, to want to look away but not be able to. Some might find this manipulative or even sadistic, but in truth it is nothing of the sort. In truth, the story of the film is so cold and dark that it demands a like tone. Why make such a film, you might ask? If there is no hope whatsoever, what is the point of subjecting the viewer to two hours of misery? Because at the heart of the film lies a portrayal of humanity, despair, and soul-searching that has never been equaled before or since. While watching the film, one would be quick to label the intruders of the couple's cottage the enemies, but the horrific truth is that David himself is equally dangerous. Throughout the picture, David displays an almost unbearable amount of hidden hostility and emotional tension. His "playful" spoken attacks on his wife are just as harmful as the intruders' physical attacks against her, which is where many critics began to misinterpret the meaning of the film. A number of reviews described Straw Dogs as the descent of a withdrawn man into the beast-like instincts within him, which is utterly ridiculous. Because at heart, David is not a pacifist; while he is certainly revolted by physical violence, he displays a tremendous amount of hostility and even sadism in more subtle forms. The ending, in which he finally resorts to physical attack, is only an external demonstration of violent feelings that have been there all along. And it is there that Peckinpah takes his biggest stance against violence itself. In his most successful film, The Wild Bunch, Peckinpah's trademarked violence was unintentionally glorified by the western genre; graphic as it was, the violence in that film was deemed acceptable because the genre itself was larger-than-life. In Straw Dogs, the violence cannot be interpreted as anything but horrific. And there is, indeed, much violence in the film ... but not in the form one might expect. In Straw Dogs, we see violence of EVERY form: implied hostility, sexual intrusion, and extreme physical attack. One could argue the significance of all this for hours on end and never reach a conclusion, and I don't think Peckinpah would want anyone to try and give one single meaning to Straw Dogs. But his use of avant-garde techniques (short slow-motion cuts), creative sound editing (keep your ear in tune to the children's party favors at the church social), and tension (so much is built throughout the picture that when it's finally released in the climax, you can barely breathe) make Straw Dogs an American cinematic landmark. When David is driving away into the night at the end of the picture and is told by his passenger, "I don't know my way home," he replies, "That's okay. I don't either." Walking away from the film, you will feel equally disoriented, but you will have been somewhere and will never forget it.Grade: A+</fullReview>

If you are anything but jarred by Sam's unbearably personalizing treatment of the rape, you should really do some soul searching, and if you are at all aroused by it, you might very well be dangerous!This is one of the most shocking, thought provoking pictures I've ever seen.

		<shortDescription>Ultimately ludicrous.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Straw Dogs" begins with one of the slowest build-ups (almost an hour long) you're ever likely to come across in a movie. Fortunately, Dustin Hoffman's superb acting holds our interest throughout this section. Then we get to the "notorious" rape scene, which is not half as offensive as it's reputed to be. Peckinpah has often been accused of being a misogynist, yet he surprised me here by portraying the shattering emotional after-effects of the rape; no way you could conclude that ultimately Susan George had "enjoyed" the experience. The real - and ultimately fatal - problem with the film is the totally misconceived climax. (SPOILERS FOLLOW) Basically, for the last 40 minutes or so, we are watching Hoffman trying to protect his house from an angry lynch mob, after refusing to surrender to them a man that he had previously hit with his car, and who may have had something to do with the disappearance of a young girl. What we know all along - but Hoffman doesn't - is that this wounded man is actually a killer. And that does put us in the uncomfortable position of asking: "What's the point? Why should so much blood be shed over the fate of an individual we don't care about at all?" (END OF SPOILERS). The violence, although not graphic at all by today's standards, reaches such "operatic" heights that it becomes ludicrous. Pechinpah even stoops to the gimmick of bringing a seemingly dead man back to life for yet another bloody struggle. And throughout all this, his herky-jerky editing style produces nausea. Of course, that may have been the intended effect after all. (**)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hmmm...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Left unchecked, Sam Peckinpah's penchant for explicit violence betrays him as a sadistic voyeur hiding behind intellectual arguments that dictate cinematic violence as a necessary evil. That may be--his `The Wild Bunch' and `Bring Me The Head Of Alfredo Garcia' are good examples where it is--but here the brutality is predicated on the specious beliefs that reason is useless in the face of violence and responsive violence is better than the original threat. Dustin Hoffman plays a mild-mannered mathematician who moves to his wife's rural English village in search of peace and quiet and finds menace in the form of the townsfolk. Hoffman seems to be still in his Benjamin Braddock mode, observing everything with a bemused, babyish look on his face and he simply wears you down with his stubbornness to change even when danger is obvious; when he finally does change, his motivations seem extreme to say the least. (A man's home is his castle and needs to be defended at all costs.) Perhaps Peckinpah's most disturbing observations, however, are about women: not only are they seen as temptresses and dimwits, but their malicious acts of betrayal (particularly from Hoffman's wife, played by Susan George) indicate they pose more of a threat to Peckinpah's masculinity than any male interloper. Though his technique has always seemed on the sloppy side (usually forgivable given his focus on concepts rather than artfulness), here, outside of a couple of TV-style flourishes, Peckinpah is in control, filming many of his interior backgrounds on a tilt to give the characters' point of view a swooning sense of disorientation. The music is by Jerry Fielding and while it's mostly bad, it does come through when it has to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch another movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting to compare STRAW DOGS to Cronenberg's A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, with which has a lot in common thematically. Peckinpah presents the viciousness of the male world as unavoidable - Hoffman's character can't escape it, even in the apparently idyllic surroundings of Cornwall. Cronenberg's protagonist is also trying to hide from brutality but, as in STRAW DOGS, it comes calling, and a choice has to be made. There are of course many other differences of plot and emphasis between the two films but it seems to me that the key difference is that Cronenberg is so much more sympathetic to his central female character. She is a person in her own right, not just an adjunct, not just a provider of sexual services. Mrs Sumner in STRAW DOGS is like the girl in OF MICE AND MEN (to which Peckinpah self-consciously refers).STRAW DOGS is, yes, very powerful, in a hitting-you-over-the-head kind of way, and, yes, it is an exploration of the values of conventional masculinity, but in the end Hoffman goes off into the sunset, having found his essential warrior-self, in the company of David Warner's character who pretty much represents uncensored desire. Viggo Mortensen in the Cronenberg film purges himself with water after his gore-fest, and returns home, where things can never be the same again. In short, Peckinpah's is a two-dimensional glamorisation of traits in half the world's population, and he doesn't seem to give a damn about any active contribution that the other half makes - like Grace Kelly in HIGH NOON (another self-conscious quote), all Susan George can do is submit to the male mafioso morality. Cronenberg's is a much more powerful and carefully thought out examination of how these traits affect men AND women. Peckinpah's film is full of powerful shots and great editing - the man is a fine film-maker. But as a philosopher of violence, on the basis of this movie, he seems to me to be so in love with his subject matter that he is in no position to mount a critique of it. It leaves a nasty taste in the mouth. Watch the Cronenberg. Or, for something more glib, but nevertheless entertaining, David Fincher's FIGHT CLUB.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What exactly is the point?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching the film for the first time 5 minutes ago and really want to give my first, undigested opinion of it.The film was at the library nearby and, because of the cast and the fact that it was a "Criterion Collection" film I thought I would give it a watch. I have no idea what the context of the making of the film is or what the director/writer were trying to express.I'm having a hard time trying to understand what the movie is all about. There is certainly a lot which could be inferred from the general setting: Mathematician/scientist; "small town hicks"; youthful, attractive, slightly immature wife; and, of course, violence. However, it is not particularly well directed violence. There seems to be an attempt at social commentary on violence, but it is done is such an "in-your-face" manner with little subtlety, direction, or nuances.The character development is not very good at all. You have no idea who people are or why they are behaving in the manner they are. Reading the synopsis you see fruitful opportunity for interesting character development. This was an opportunity lost.The dialogue is mediocre (the last line of the film made me glad it was ending). And, while he is good when he does it well, Dustin Hoffman plays Dustin Hoffman (as Dustin Hoffman with Dustin Hoffman as his speech coach) in this film... he plays within the middle of his range. Frankly, the bit part actors performed best in this film.Overall, I was not left with much of an impression at all from the film. While the context for release, life of the author, or historical context in which the film was released may be important to the film itself, there is not much in it to make it a "classic" or a "must see." I am not sure why this film is in the "Criterion Collection," but I will read other peoples' comments to try and figure it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't really appreciate this movie until several viewings. Oh, I remembered it as one of the shocking "new" movies of the period in which nudity and graphic violence were being shown on screen for the first time...but in a later viewing on VHS in the '90s, I thought it was so-so.A few years ago, with a good DVD print I was more than impressed. The movie, which I had thought was a little slow by the second viewing, was not on the third (and fourth and recent fifth). I have to admit: watching Susan George is one of the big enjoyments of this movie. She is hot! In reality, it's doubtful someone like her would marry a nerd like the character played by Dustin Hoffman. Nonetheless, as all of you who have seen this know, that "nerd" comes out of his shell in the suspense-filled last half hour.There are still a few things I didn't like here, such as a too-sympathetic viewpoint of a child molester; a quick cheap shot at Christianity by Hoffman (no surprise) and a film that has mostly unlikeable people. However, the story is so involving it more than makes up for the negatives.....and it gets better and better with each viewing (and each improved DVD offering widescreen and a clearer print).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You really don't care, do you?" This fascinating, brilliant film from Sam Peckinpah is compelling and nightmarish, a blend of rural horror and the western, only set in the English countryside. It's not just well-crafted, stomach-churning entertainment, it's about human nature and the realisation of human nature. David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman) is a passive, friendly American mathematician, who has moved with his wife Amy (Susan George), to her old house on the outskirts of a small English coastal town, so that he can have peace to think and work on his book. Almost instantly however, he's met with hostility by the rowdy locals, who start to play games with him and taunt him, actively abusing his wife to cause conflict between them, as "pacifist" David is pressured to act by Amy, who knows full well what is going on and is angered by David's so-what denial. Eventually things come to a head in the film's most notorious scene, and they reach breaking point. Finally an unfortunate turn of events forces David to act. There is no real ambiguity about David Sumner for us, only for him. It's clear from the start, from Hoffman's performance, in a bar scene in which boorish, loud drunkard Tom Hedden (Peter Vaughan) gets violent when he's refused a drink, that David is thrilled by the spectacle, although he does not acknowledge this himself, preferring to live a cosy, comfortable, peaceful ideal that is false. It's fitting that he's a mathematician, a rationalist trying to make sense of things with numbers and figures on a blackboard. Indeed David Sumner's non-confrontational attitude seems like just another cold form of dominance and aggression, and effectively provokes the men working on his garage. The educated man may just be the best barbarian of them all. In the final siege of the house, David outsmarts the invaders in clever and sadistic ways, blowing Tom Hedden's foot off, and throwing a man-trap onto Charlie Venner's (Del Henney) head. All of this seems cheerfully automatic, like a dance, and David even plays music at one point. There's no real character arc for David as he hasn't really changed, only his sense of self. In the final scenes he sort of moves around loosely, smiling, having received catharsis from the violence, release from his frustration, and maybe some truth. It's an excellent performance from Dustin Hoffman. Susan George is also excellent as Amy, and has a great dynamic with Hoffman, no doubt helped by the fact that they spent some time with each other before filming. She's convincingly wild and savage, particularly in the final scenes, shattering David's ideal of the woman he married, and throughout the film she exercises her own kind of dominance over David, finally pushing him to fight back. As they settle in, any notion of settling is dissolved to reveal an all-pervasive violence, and nature wins as they eventually both succumb to their primal instincts and to necessity. The film is directed with great flair and style by Sam Peckinpah. The countryside is as beautiful as the desert landscapes of The Wild Bunch, only cold and harsh, and it has much in common with the western in the way it uses the landscape. Even the story could have been a western. The film is very atmospheric; extra mist was poured onto the moors for the finale. The film is shot in a very cold, stark way, distanced somewhat from the performers. Some scenes are shot and edited in such a way that makes them disturbingly effective, such as the party scene in the church, in which Amy has flashbacks to her violation inter-cut with children and adults blowing party horns. Almost all of the extras seem like frenzied animals. The supporting cast is great and for the most part very menacing, but natural. Peter Vaughan, Ken Hutchison, Del Henney and Jim Norton are all excellent, and there's a small role from David Warner as Henry Niles, a man shunned by the town folk for having problems. The film's title comes from Chinese philosopher Lau-Tzu - "Heaven and Earth are not human, and regard the people as straw dogs." The opening scene, descending from a grey sky on to a scene of children running around and playing, suggests that we are just animals who don't know what we are or why, and that violent sacrifice is natural and necessary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow-moving and overrated... but builds up to a superb, violent climax</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah was a notoriously angry and aggressive man who often conflicted with studios, actors and fellow film-crew. So it's no surprising that he is renowned for his violent films, particularly his 1969 Western "The Wild Bunch", which irrevocably changed the Western - and cinema - forever for it's depiction of on-screen bloody violence. So, we have Peckinpah to thank for the violent cinema we have today (I'm not being sarcastic). Personally, I don't think much of his films. "The Wild Bunch" didn't do much for me, although I did admire it's innovative and daring violence which was something for it's time. I was disappointed with "Cross of Iron", his WW2 picture about the German's on the Eastern Front. Peckinpah himself had served with the US Marine Corps during WW2, however, to his disappointment, he never actually saw combat. He gained a lot of bad attention for himself, and his 1971 film "Straw Dogs" brought the bad publicity to a whole new level, as it contains a very controversial scene where a woman seems to enjoy being raped. I won't go to much into this, as it's incredible how much this has been talked about. However, I'll just say that personally I found it to be a disgusting, poorly made scene, for the simple fact that it was just plain ludicrous, as well as offensive towards women. Rape is not something that should be portrayed as it is here. Look towards films like "I Spit on Your Grave" and "The Last House on the Left" for it's true realistic and harrowing nature. Interestly, "Straw Dogs" was released the same year as fellow controversial films "Dirty Harry" and "A Clockwork Orange". Sweet Jesus, that was some year for the censorship board! Dustin Hoffman (In a very surprising role - he later admitted that he only took the part because he needed the money) is a mathematician who moves to the home village of his English wife Amy. The couple have run away from American in the height of increasing social unrest - but if they thought it was bad in the States... oh boy! It isn't long at all before the small village, depicted as being inhabited by about twenty people, most of whom are your stereotypical inbred scum who drink and perv all day, become aware of the Yank and the local girl moving in. The local hoodlums are led by Susan's old boyfriend (Del Henney), who resent their arrival right away, despite all them drooling over the attractive Amy. The hoodlums offer to do repairs on the couple's house, but it isn't long before they begin harassing them, and because David is so timid and reluctant when it comes to confrontation, it isn't long before their cat is killed and hung in their wardrobe, Susan is raped, and when a child molester/killer is on the run from the gang, David takes him in to defend him... and finally, he decides to take a stand and protect his home and his wife. "I will not allow violence against this house..." Carnage ensues.Peckinpah certainly takes his time here... which is the problem I had with his later film "Cross of Iron". It's tedious at times, as the first hour is dedicated to a slow building of tension in order to release an explosive conclusion and confrontation at the end. It's worth sitting through just to see that, as the push-over David finally grows a pair and fights back; fortifying his house and picking the drunken ruffians off one by one after it becomes apparent that he will be killed, along with Susan. Hoffman is extremely out of place in this film, however, he gives a superb performance and I really could not have pictured someone else in the role. Susan George, I found, was extremely irritating and overall, Amy and David seemed like the most unlikeliest couple ever! The screenplay is very questionable at times, especially when it comes to the 'rape' scene which descends into a complete farce when Amy appears to 'enjoy' it... at the beginning she tries to feebly fight him off, before kissing and hugging her old boyfriend who is performing the assault on her. However, the second assault which follows straight after is without a doubt rape. This is all poor directing and work on Peckinpah's part... like what the hell was he thinking? This is just disgusting, and surely, as an educated man, he could have foreseen the consequences of such a scene? Yes... the film was banned for 18 years in the UK! "Straw Dogs" is a decent enough film, although I don't think I'd be too pushed on watching it again. It's themes of resentment towards outsiders and isolation are engulfed by the overwhelming odour of what it really is: a macho-fantasy in which masculinity is measured by how you abuse women and by how much you can drink down at the local. Whereas David, the intelligent but timid and cowardly man, only proves his masculinity when he single-handedly takes the law into his own hands and brutally kills the men who are trying to take a child killer into custody! It's pure Pekinpah alright; take a story and push as many buttons and pull as many strings and see how much you can anger certain fractions of society. Did I enjoy it? Well, I was bored for a good bit of it, but overall, I liked it because of Hoffman's performance and for the brilliant, violent confrontation at the end. A film worthy of it's controversy... but far from brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Existence. As puzzle. Dark pieces. Gray childhood. Music as Jacob ladder. Pendulum from dizzy heights to abysses. A honest story about success and its harsh price. Lights, public and horrible night. Death as circle and love as pray. Result - a movie, special movie behind cages or traps. Sketch of a brilliant man and her wars. Nothing forced. Nothing artificial, pink or fake. And the merit is, in great measure, work of Dustin Hoffmand. Which is in perfect place, with precise art of balance of feelings, gestures and expression. A impressive David Sumner . Bricks for role - the truth in pure form. The film may be extraordinary, spectacular, sad, original or masterpiece. But important is only the crumb after its end. Not presentation of a life, not homage of a great artist. Only clay of a house. And the traces of a silhouette. Natural, young Dustin Hoffmand is David Sumner .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Straw Dogs" Has Teeth!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Controversial filmmaker Sam Peckinpah forsook his characteristic Old West setting in "Straw Dogs" to depict how the most harmless milquetoast in the universe can metamorphose into a man of violence. Basically, what you have in Peckinpah's sixth film is the theme of survival of the fittest. British author Gordon Williams' novel "The Siege at the Trencher's Farm" served as the film's literary source. According to Peckinpah biographer David Wheddle," Peckinpah changed the title of the film to "Straw Dogs" based on Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu's quote in "The Book of 5,0000 Characters." The passage Peckinpah cited is "Heaven and Earth are ruthless, and treat the myriad creatures as straw dogs: the sage is ruthless and treated the people as straw dogs. ... Is not the space between Heaven and Earth like a bellows?" Weddle doesn't identify the individual who gave Peckinpah the inspiration for the quotation. According to Marshal Fine and Garner Simmons in their respective Peckinpah biographies "Blood Sam" and "Peckinpah: A Portrait in Montage," actor Walter Kelly furnished the director with Tzu's quote. Initially, writes Peckinpah biographer Garner Simmons, "Logan's Run" scenarist David Z. Goodman penned two early drafts of the script. Goodman told Simmons about the differences between the book and the film. One of the minor changes was that the novel's protagonist George Magruder was an English professor rather than an astrophysicist. The biggest change, however, was no rape occurred in the novel. Furthermore, according to Simmons, Williams hated Peckinpah's use of sex, not violence.Mild-mannered American mathematician David Sumner (a bespectacled Dustin Hoffman of "The Graduate") takes a sabbatical in tranquil Cornwall, England, far away from the violence and unrest in America so he can work on a grant. When the villagers ask him if he saw any of this turmoil, David says that he only saw the violence between the commercials on television. The rural Cornwall village, where "Straw Dogs" takes place, is the hometown of his slutty wife Amy (Susan George of "Lola"), and their marriage appears to be deteriorating because his Lolita-type spouse wants him to pay more attention to her than work on his equations. Simmons quotes Hoffman who wasn't entirely sold on either Susan George's casting as well as the notion that David would have married such a shallow-minded woman. Indeed, Amy traipses around the village with no bra on as he brings her husband the gift of a man-trap used in the old days to catch poachers. Amy excites the locals with her no-bra-look. As it turns out, one of the locals is none other than an old boyfriend Charlie Venner (Del Henney of "Brannigan") who Amy hasn't seen in six years. Charlie helps David load the man-trap into his convertible Triumph coupe. David decides to hire Charlie to help Norman Scutt (Ken Hutchison of "Ladyhawke") complete work on the roof of his garage. These ruffians are more intent on watching Amy parade around bare-chested than perform their chores. Meantime, the locals are not sure about how to deal with David. Of course, the local constable, Major John Scott (T.P. McKenna of "Red Scorpion"), and the Reverend Barney Hood (Colin Welland of "Villain"), treat David with kindness, but Tom Hedden (Peter Vaughan of "The Mackintosh Man") and his relatives have nothing but contempt for him. Eventually, Tom's evil relatives and their friends take David on a duck hunting trip and abandon him in the wilderness, while Charlie and his mate Norman rape Amy. First, Charlie rapes Amy in a lovingly tender fashion, but Norman shares none of Charlie's sentiments. Meantime, a simpleton, Harry Niles (David Warner of "The Omen") arouses trouble because he was not jailed for a sex crime. Everything comes to a head after a church party when Tom's slutty daughter Janice Hedden (Sally Thomsett of "Baxter!") tries to take advantage of Harry because David wants nothing to do with her. Tom has warned Henry's brother about him.The simple-minded Henry and Janice retire to a barn for their assignation. Poor Janice has no idea that she is playing with fire. Henry kills her in a scene straight out of "Of Mice and Men" with a conspicuous lack of emotion. Later, David hits Henry with his car on the way home from the church party. A drunken Tom and his mates show up at David's house and demand that he hand over Henry. David refuses and chaos ensues. When Major Scott tries to intervene, Tom kills him by accident and things get out of hand. Amy wants David to hand over Henry to Tom and company, but our hero refuses. At the same time, he tries to maintain his nonviolence, but Tom and company sorely try him until he retaliates and everybody but David, Amy, and Henry survive. Dustin Hoffman delivers a dynamic performance and Peter Vaughn makes a nefarious villain.Several scenes stand out by themselves. For example, Peter Vaughan's first scene in the bar when he calls for another pint and raises hell until he gets it is vigorous stuff. The scene when Hoffman careens in his Triumph between a truck and a bull dozer approaching each other when him slipping between them is exciting. Peckinpah orchestrated the final quarter-hour for maximum suspense and tension. The bloodiest that "Straw Dogs" gets is when a lout blows his foot off with his own double-barreled shotgun. Peckinpah builds up the narrative so that we are aware of what the opposition looks like and makes Hoffman look so naive and harmless that you relish the outcome when he defeats his enemies. Peckinpah foreshadows the use of a giant steel mantrap and his use of violence is still grisly but it seems toned-down but realistic compared with his classic western "The Wild Bunch." The ambiguous ending will prompt many interpretation. As David is driving the retarded Niles home, Niles says, "I don't know my way home." David replies, "That's okay, neither do I."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Powerfully Intelligent Thriller of the 70's ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Straw Dogs" ignites a flame that centuries of civilization didn't extinguish, reminding us that it takes more than a biological asset to make a man. Manhood is less a pride to be preached than a virtue to be reached and "Straws Dogs" is Sam Peckinpah's masterwork honoring the idea of a necessary violence revealing both cowardice and bravery. This Darwinian issue is tackled in such an exhilarating way we wonder if he's condemning or celebrating it."Straw Dogs" is a harrowing contemplation of a man's gradual metamorphosis. A man who wants peace so much, until he realizes that peace is a privilege that cannot be obtained without fighting. Dangerous or deadly, at least fighting guarantees self-respect, and one cannot inspire respect without self-respect. We're not men, we become that. And we can't live in the illusory comfort of feeling respected just because we're called "sir". Sooner or later, we face our own condition as men. And that's why, more than a psychological thriller, "Straw Dogs" is an existential masterpiece.And the character who crystallizes both our frustrations and our empathy is Dustin Hoffman as David Summer, an American mathematician, married to a young, blonde English girl, Amy, played by the beautiful Susan George. She's the slut of the small rural town they live in, a quite hostile environment for David, whose intelligence and awkward mannerisms, makes him a believable stereotypical nerd, incapable of any sociability. A strange man and a stranger, the perfect target for a progressively growing harassment, provoking so many embarrassing interactions and transforming David's mind into a psychic ticking bomb.And compared to these English hunks, David exudes cowardice and a total lack of virility inherited from a whole life of studies and quietness ? as if David spent most of his time, mourning the loss of manhood caused by a meaningless life. Like the archetypal Peckinpah's character, he's a loner waiting for redemption. His patience emphasizes a passive attitude, as if he was waiting for things to loosen up. But the provocation only goes worse, like when his harassers hang the cat in his bedroom's closet, proving that he doesn't even control his intimacy? and this is only a warning before the ultimate humiliation.And fate couldn't have picked a more convenient tool, with Amy, the trophy wife envied by the village men. The more they got used to David's unmanly behavior, the more it reinforced the idea that he didn't deserve his wife. And this is where Sam Peckinpah started making enemies through this film, by suggesting that we still live in a prehistoric era were it takes muscles to have the girl, not brains. But this is a misinterpretation because it's not a matter of muscles either, but of guts. And yes, women despise gut-less men. This is the controversial aspect of the film illustrated by the ambiguous yet, memorable rape scene.Yes, it's disturbing because it's one of the bravest moments ever captured on film. It doesn't deny the truth that rape is one sick and abject act, but, it also helps to the characterization of Amy, a girl who's so shocked by her husband's lack of virility that she found like a sort of relief from living a brief but intense moment where she feels the strength of a man, the strength that could only go by the act of overpowering her. The rape was the climactic aspect of her constantly teasing exhibitions to make David jealous, and the involuntary consequence of a rather childish attitude.But I'm glad Sam left out the ambiguity when came the second rape, more disturbing and brutal. Because there was no implicitness anymore, Amy was a victim and we could blame David for having been fooled again by going hunting. At that point, a castrated David realized that handling a gun and shooting a bird didn't make him more a man and that he was the buffoon of a stupid farce with a poor bird as a collateral damage and Amy, the real prey. David did it wrong, but for the last time. At that point, men were either savage beasts or weak and gut-less, and women objects of 'possession'. Talk about an optimistic view on humanity. But this is the genius of "Straw Dogs"' characterization: only an extreme situation could highlight the ruthless ferocity of human condition and make the climax even more rewarding, when David finally reaches his breaking point, incarnated by the iconic sight of his glasses' broken lens.And the apotheosis of all this repressed anger is a bloody massacre where David defends his honor, his wife, and his territory as if his life depended on it, until his life really depended on it. Never believing in God, David believed in instinct, but ironically overcame his enemies in a biblical poetry, as if he was David with his brains as a sling versus an outnumbering Goliath. But Goliath and God were dead in that celebration of violence whose graphicness was only equaled by the disturbing rape scene. We're far from the poetry of "The Wild Bunch" climactic shootout: here, the deaths are painful and ugly like symbolizing the struggle to conquer one's own pride. Not about 'dying in a blaze of glory' but resurrecting from the dirt. No conquest without danger, no redemption without conquest, no life without passion. Peckinpah paved a bloody way for the future Scorsese's and Tarantino's.Unfairly labeled as fascist by some pompous critics, "Straw Dogs" is on the contrary, one of the most powerfully intelligent thrillers ever made, working on a Darwinist, existential and finally extraordinary Nietschian level where one man must obey his courage to fight or die? and it's so fascinating that it also works on a self-reflexive away, since this is a movie about the guts it takes to be a man ? to make his point about his own idea of manhood, that's exactly what Sam Peckinpah, a bloody genius, did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im not fond of Peckinpah's work however if i was going to say what was had heard about but had never seen. In this film Dustin Hoffman portrays David Sumner a mathematician who moves to the UK with his wife Amy (Susan George) end up meeting with a past beau of hers and his band of bad news friends. He hires some of them to finish construction on their new home all the whilst googling at Amy every chance they get. This activity draws a blind eye on David as he often accuses his wife who complains about the staring as it being all in her head. Unfortunately it is not as we see later on in the film. After driving home one night in the fog they accidentally run down the town pervert who just happened to be responsible for murdering the gang's oldest members daughter. David amidst Amy's refusal brings the offender to his home in a bid to call the police and get ,medical attention to him, only its not medical attention he receives..The gang shows up and they will do anything to get in the house and retrieve the offender, only one thing though...this is David's house and he is ready to defend it on all costs! A good little thriller that was number 3 on my list of classics to see. Meh! Good little time waster, it's worth a look!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is it possible that Peckinpah built this film so that people at some future date would finally understand it, possibly in the year 2000? Dustin Hoffman enacts the role of a mathematician who moves with his wife to the small village of her birth. The obvious analogies are the celestial alignments that proceed each of the alchemical transmutations in the film. Now alien worlds fly by, all of their colors and hues gone wild. Things then slowly become unravelled until Dustin finally realizes that the only language the country hicks understand is violence. The pyramids of Egypt and the great cathedrals of France are referred to as 'books of stone'. It is in that ending that Peckinpah reveals his deep inner profound knowledge of alchemy, gnosticism and the ancient view of the spirit domain. I give this movie 5 stars because I have always liked Susan George (That Summer of White Roses).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget Pulp Fiction. Forget the stupid Death Wish movies too. This is a work of art that doesn't play nice. I think that the story is simply saying this. Violence can not be avoided. You cannot run or hide from it because IT will find YOU! Hoffman is a mathematician who leaves the U.S. because he doesn't want to get involved in the times of the Vietnam war and protests that turn ugly. So he figures he will get a home in the English countryside and he and his wife will live some sort of idyllic existence. Unfortunately for him, his manipulative little girl mentality of a wife and the town locals have a different idea. Soon, he is involved, like it or not, in a war of his won, protecting his home and a disturbed and possibly retarded monster of an oaf who has done a terrible thing before Hoffamn hits him with his car and feels responsible for him. This leads to a brutal onslaught of his home and his whole life. Great and gripping in its ferocity, it draws you in every viewing. Any of the fools who rip it to bits as a terrible film are just damn wimps. Go watch a Disney movie and suck your thumbs, boys and girls. This one is a slice of real life magnified, albeit the ugliest parts of it. LOVE this movie even if it makes me squirm more than a few times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that I was really only interested in watching this film because of the controversy surrounding it as I had never heard off anyone else who had seen it if it was any use. Unfortunately, I fell into the trap of waiting and wondering what the controversy was all about when really I should have just been watching it for what it is, that being a well directed, low-budget thriller! With that said, I still did enjoy what I saw and didn't get too sucked into the whole "why was this banned at all" buzz! The characters are all interesting and mysterious so you can really get into their world due to some great directing. Hoffman is pretty good but not nearly at his best. The rest of the cast are pretty mediocre but its not really a movie for acting to shine through on this type of budget.The rape scene is actually quite tastefully done and I really think that the movie has long since outdated its X rating that would have been appropriate upon its release. Unlike "clockwork orange", "suspiria" or "Driller Killer" which are all still quite shocking to this day.My rating is 6 for a good piece on how a man can be pushed too far but the movie still has its flaws that prevent me from rating it any higher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping and Violent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the violent "The Wild Bunch," Peckinpah turned to the gentle "The Ballad of Cable Hogue" before returning to his trademark violence in this engaging film. Hoffman is good as usual as a mild-mannered American mathematician pushed to the brink by local hoodlums in the English countryside. George is his bored and flirtatious British wife. The last third of this film is quite gripping, as Hoffman must literally protect his house. Although controversial in its day, the violence is not as disturbing as the same year's "A Clockwork Orange." The only weakness is that there is no chemistry between Hoffman and George; they are not believable as husband and wife.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good statement on a grim reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon first viewing, Straw Dogs seemed a little bit over-hyped to me. I read quite a few reviews and commentaries on it (from the past and present) and so decided to check it out for myself. After I watched it a few more times, concentrating on it more closely and getting more absorbed into the themes, the storyline, the character nuances and pathos, the male/female interactions, etc, and finally deciding that it was indeed a quality film. There has been much said about its depiction of the supposed nature of masculinity and femininity (the latter not well showcased, by Susan George's character or by the sexually adventurous young female local who is accidentally killed by a mentally handicapped man), but it's really the masculine aspect that is focused on in any real depth. The contrast between Hoffman's new age, more gentle, maleness and the rustic and more traditional, brutish, "conscienceless" masculinity displayed by the local men is an often entertaining juxtaposition (and let's not forget the more balanced, level-headed, reasonable yet still tough and authoritative manhood of the local sheriff in the equation). The film is obviously making a statement about the violent nature of humanity and men in particular, showing the viewer different types of masculinity and showing how, supposedly, Hoffman's more new age type doesn't hold up to nature, because ultimately Mr. Sumner (Hoffman's character) proves that he is not so evolved after being constantly harassed and provoked by the more brutish men. This can be taken in many ways: nature overcoming nurture, a man pushed to the brink, a man merely trying to protect his home and wife from invaders,etc; but the film overlooks the very powerful forces of socialization that have a part to play in shaping people, and instead believes that "nature" has all the say, when that is just not true.The violence still stands up to today's films, especially the sexual violence, which actually goes much further than many PC/feminist whipped, cowardly mainstream (or even indie) filmmakers of today would allow or be allowed(almost as if they want to make us believe that rape doesn't exist). Therefore, the film hasn't lost its relevance in that respect, as many might believe. As for it's effect on me, I actually find it indescribably sad that such brutish louts are still around in great number today, but of course this kind of toxic socialization of men hasn't yet stopped, and has almost, very unfortunately, increased slightly since the Reagon/Mulrooney era. I say this because this film, consciously or not, gives us a look at what this kind of socialization of men can lead to: a pack of , disrespectful, thoughtless, malignant 'straw dogs' that leads to irrational and brutal killing sprees that offer no shining light into a more sophisticated way of dealing with situations--but of course that is just a part of reality, and the film dealt with this troubling and dangerous reality quite well. I've read many reviews on this film and, surprisingly, none have commented on this angle. So perhaps even though Hoffman's character may be described as "wussy" or "castrated" (which, of course, he ultimately proves he is not) maybe if the other men were a little more like him (or least like the sheriff) then the world would be a much better, safer, place in which to live.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first see this film in the early 80s,as you could hire it out on video in the UK,although it was hard to get hold of,but back then the second rape scene was cut out,so in a way it didn't make a lot of sense,when she was having flashbacks at the church fate and you were seeing a second darker haired man in her memory,you thought who the hell was he,whats he got to do with it.The film was only hired out in video shops for a short time ,a year or two at the most,because i tried to get it out again and you just couldn't find it anywhere.Then about four years ago they released it in its original format on DVD,so i had to buy it.When seeing the film the second time,you see the second rape scene and it all made more sense,it made the film even more controversial,even though it was controversial the first time id seen it.The problem is although a great film,it does sort of imply to the wrong sort of man {and i mean wrong}that women may not take rape as seriously as they say they do,and that they may not mind being raped by someone they do fancy,as in the film Susan George does begin to enjoy the rape.And don't forget genuine rape victims ,would not want to see this kind of portrayal it would be very disturbing to them.In the 70s UK rape was well on the increase,and a lot of cases were going unreported,purely because women didn't want further humiliation of talking about their ordeal.The womens lib movement and other government bodies were trying hard to change this,urging women to come forward and give evidence against attackers.So what it all boils down to is that this film was considered a bit dangerous and would have hindered the new campaigns at the time.And don't forget the womens lib movement which was very anti this film were very powerful.Well they got their own way as always ha ha.But by todays standards this film is nowhere near as violent and disturbing as a lot of films made now.It still has a certain amount of shock value,which you wont easily forget,and it does have a good ending,all the bad guys lose.I highly recommend this film,i don't believe it could do much damage nowadays.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a wonderful world we live in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a moment in Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs where petulant brat Susan George gets out of her car in front of the old chum townies she and milquetoast husband Dustin Hoffman have hired to repair their cottage in rural England, and her skirt hikes up, exposing her underwear. She goes out of her way to expose herself (and again, when she strips off her top and stands in front of a window, loose breasts swinging), then glares angrily at the townies for their staring.George's Amy is the perfect woman for women-haters everywhere. She's irresponsible and foolish, victim and participant, immature and demanding of respect. This character drives Peckinpah's hateful psychological mishmash along to its inevitable and predictable conclusion, a ghastly climax wherein pacifist Hoffman has to defend his retarded neighbor and feckless wife from a full-frontal assault on home and hearth.Hoffman is such a miserable coward that we sit astonished at what new humiliation he will rationalize, while he sucks down cigarettes as if there was something more than tobacco in them. The townies are giggling, smelly, whiskey-swilling louts who seem genuinely peeved that George doesn't want to strike up her old relationships with them (Hoffman is such a weenie that the viewer starts to ask the same question).But, considering Susan George's sour countenance and lush, natural attributes, you know that she's going to pay for her fecklessness. She gets pseudo-raped, wrapping herself around her first attacker to pull as much manliness and aggression from him as she can (remember, she's married to Hoffman). Then the second townie shows up for his turn.Herein lies Peckinpah's underlying hatred of his female character. She is everything men love physically and hate intellectually and emotionally. He's saying that woman are bigger louts than men, therefore, to quote a line from Blazing Saddles, it's okay to work up a "Number Six" on them.Straw Dogs is quite possibly the ugliest Peckinpah ever made, even more than Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid. There, you just get to see chickens get their heads blown off.Lucky chickens--if Peckinpah's vision of humanity is the realistic one.</fullReview>

I didn't get very well his expression at the end where Niles say: I don't know my way home. Then Sumner says: I don't either. And he smiles, what I felt is that he was now happy for realizing how he is and he didn't care anymore about his wife or something. Could someone clarify this for me?

		<fullReview>Add Peckinpah to the front of your list of people who pushed the "aesthetic extreme" in American cinema. Following him comes Bakshi and Ollie Stone...and I think you know the rest. Unlike his followers, Peckinpah could never get good production values for his work. Hence they all look cheap and used (and not in the good way). This movie, as with 'Wild Bunch', is of historical interest. I personally find Peckinpah's method too simple. He is all about zooms and too often his camera is tethered to characters. Seriously, you can call this an early Scorsese movie. For my imagination, I just wonder how Malick or Jewison would've handled it.Two things make this interesting: the first is Jerry Fielding's unnatural score. It isn't bad, but it creates the illusion of an alien world in ways that Peckinpah himself cannot.The second is Peckinpah's contribution to the Eisenstein montage. Most of the "extremists" have adopted it ever since. I guess that involves less thinking for them.Once again, Sam hits on religion. This time using science (and some concepts of evolution). If you do watch this, follow it up with 'Midnight Express'...same themes, different people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wimp Becomes Triumphant !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie about a wimpish American mathematics professor (Dustin Hoffman) and his ever oh so hot wife (Susan George) who move to the English country side. Once they settle there they are accosted by neighborhood thugs whose only goal is to demean and humiliate them.SPOILERS- My interpretation of the movie is that it shows the metamorphasis of a meek little man into warrior who uses his high intelligence coupled with rage to just wipe out all the thugs. I love the ending after he just kicks everybodys butt and then walks out on his wife (who never seemed to appreciate him anyway), YET, shows compassion for that neighborhood idiot he hit with his car. The beginning of this flick is a little slow but gets interesting slowly but surely. Hoffman was perfect for the role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poorly shot, edited and scored film becomes a brilliant, fine thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS.Don't be mistaken-- the first half of Straw Dogs is a very bad movie. The first hour and a half plays with all the candor and grace of a B-horror accident film. Peckinpah relies on film techniques that were even cliche and antiquated when the film was made, such as wipes and flurry cuts. The performances are charming and clever, but not much more than that-- Susan George is Dustin Hoffman's young trophy wife, and she acts it, antagonizing him while he attempts to write his book. Their relationship feels stilted and staged-- their conflicts are shallow and unclear.The second half of Straw Dogs turns a corner so sharply that one can only assume that Peckinpah has been playing possum, sugaring an unpleasant subject so that we will swallow it whole without questioning. The film's score, an attrocious string and vibraphone affair, is stripped away, and the film becomes very quiet. As tensions escalate and Hoffman slowly realizes that he is in a showdown with his life in the balance, the film's first half begins to make beautiful sense. Though his conflicts were shallow, we now know that he cannot rely on Susan George-- she is too young, too flighty. His conflicts with the locals are now in full force. Though it is not the film it once was, no one can be surprised by the sudden escalation of gravity to each scene, and Peckinpah's sudden improvement in his filmmaking abilities. Indeed, the last half is glorious-- rapt, tense. The fog drifting over Hoffman's land as the locals break windows and pound the doors create a sense of terrible isolation, as if Hoffman were not fighting men on a farm but demons in a dream. Indeed, he must also cope with treason in his own house, as Susan George begs to be let go.But most ineresting about Straw Dogs is the nature of its premise. With Henry Niles, who has just committed murder against Janice Hedon, lying injured on the sofa of his wife's cottage, Hoffman decides that he is, with lethal force and at the risk of great personal loss, going to protect a guilty man and defend a house that is not his. This is crucial to understanding the gravity of Hoffman's plight. It would have been much easier had Peckinpah made Henry Niles the unfair traget of the local's rage, and mad the cottage belong to Hoffman. But neither of these are true, and Hoffman's is a stand only for himself, a man who has been called a coward by his own wife and has not earned even the smallest of respects from the locals.A magnificent mess-- what you hate about the first half you will love about the second half. What seems boring and muddy in the first half will be sharp as a razor in the second. The two halves are the same film-- one wearing the horse's head and one wearing the horse's rear, working in separate collaboration. Peckinpah lures us in-- not with slick, quality filmmaking, but with bad filmmaking and bad performances. Only a master could turn this on its ear and use it to tremendous advantage. Do yourself a favor and rent this hidden gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mild or Wild?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1971 was a watershed year in many ways for mainstream cinema;such controversial films as THE DEVILS(Ken Russell),GET CARTER(Mike Hodges),A CLOCKWORK ORANGE(Stanley Kubrick),and STRAW DOGS(Sam Peckinpah).The above were often lambasted for their portrayals of sex and violence,more explicit-seeming than what had been witnessed in cinema before.All the above mentioned were British-produced films,and the last two named were directed by celebrated American filmmakers. Three decades on,these films seem far tamer now then when first shown,inevitably,but what seemed daring and nastily innovative then dosen't make them undisturbing now. STRAW DOGS,arguably the most controversal of the lot,is not as disgustingly unpleasant as some critics would make you think.There is violence,but not as gratuitous as you'd think.THE WILD BUNCH(1969),Peckinpah's best-known work,for instance,is far bloodier and unrelenting,and the use of bad language is virtually non-existent. The story itself,about a mild-mannered American scholar and his young wife being intimidated by Cornish locals,is fairly familiar,but Peckinpah does a good job of stoking up tension until the final siege at Dustin Hoffman's house. It fails somewhat in portraying Cornish yokels as in-bred idiots;this worked rather better in John Boorman's DELIVERENCE the following year.(Reversing Peckinpah's example,Boorman was a British filmmaker in Rural America) It was more credible having in-bred Hillbillies as villains,as the Rural areas they live in are so isolated from Urban America,much more than rural areas in England. The scene which caused the most fuss was the rape sequence involving Susan George,Del Henney and Ken Huchison.Miss George eventually seems to like the rape by Henney,but reacts with horror when buggered by Huchison.However,the script makes clear that she and Henney had been lovers previously,so is that first part of the scene showing rape anyway? Peckinpah's ambivilence to the female character is not surprising;there has probably never been a more masculine-obsessed,misogynist director in history.(Female characters in his other films are treated with similiar disdain or ignorance) So,STRAW DOGS is a decent thriller in many ways,just unbalanced by the above aberrations.Well-acted by the cast(such fine character actors as Peter Vaughan,T.P McKenna and Peter Arne are present);it's not the gore fest as portrayed by some critics,and by contempary standards is quite mild.But,watch the film and decide:MILD or WILD?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deliverance in Cornwall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film when it first came out and thought it quite frightening. Today though the violence seemed nothing special compared to say 'Reservoir Dogs' oddly another 'dog' title. But conversely the rape scene was more disturbing to me than it was back then. This of course is an indication of how society has changed in relation to how women are treated on the subject of rape. I think there might have been some editing here. There was a fleeting shot of George's back with the brute behind her; it was so quick I think there was a cut there. I didn't think the yokels were at all convincing, they just did not seem that menacing especially that silly twit running around with a false nose. Was that an echo of Clockwork Orange? English heavies haven't got what it takes, they are not as menacing as American they just don't look particularly psychopathic, unlike those brutes in 'Deliverance' one of whom raped Ned Beatty. (Oh! and why wasn't that banned for twenty five years). The English always do a good suave psychopathic but can't do a working class one. This was a pre 'Deliverance' type film if Peckinpah had made it in the backwoods of Louisiana it would still have impact today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting effort that falls short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Straw Dogs' has just been shown for the first time on British terrestrial television, trailing behind it a polarised reputation. A work of genius from a first class director or a work of incompetent exploitation with nasty violence and deep misogyny. Well, it is neither of course but an interesting attempt by Peckinpah to portray some of his favourite themes in an English rural setting. On the negative side the plot and characterisation don't make much sense. However good Hoffman acts (and he is good) his narrative change from sniffing academic to all action hero is ludicrous. Also Susan George was not a good enough actress to play what was potentially the most interesting character. The other roles are barely sketched in.On the positive side, the suspense does build tightly and the feeling of being an alien in a strange land comes across well. Although the plot points are heavily laboured this isn't a film by a hack director.The two main issues of criticism are the rape scene and the violence at the end. With the passage of time they have been superseded by worst portrayals of violence sexual violence but one doesn't feel they are exploitation. Peckinpah is making serious points about masculinity and power and civilisation and the monsters of the id. It is not as profound as his masterpiece, 'The Wild Bunch' but it is a film worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Straw Dogs, Sam Peckinpah, 1971</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILERS*A peace-loving American mathematician and his English wife move to a Cornish farm in the hope of securing a quieter life, only to have their lives shattered by the local workers. Set against the bleak moorland of Cornwall, this was a film banned in Britain for a long time, because of an infamous rape scene in which the victim appears to 'enjoy' her attack - although Peckinpah later shows us the mental trauma associated with such a terrible event. The film features excellent performances all round, although for the most Peckinpah's direction is average. The film is also very slowly paced, until the frantic last forty minutes. I do have a problem with the climax of the film, it seemed very unbelievable that Sumner would turn from a coward, afraid to ask the gang about the killing of his wife's cat, to someone willing to risk everything to protect his home and a retarded man that he doesn't know (and doesn't know has just, albeit unwittingly, killed a girl - very Of Mice And Men). The fact that Sumner also seems to enjoy defending his home in such a violent way mirrors his wife's earlier 'enjoyment' of a horrific act, showing us that being forced into base, animal actions may yield surprising and disturbing results.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated, pretentious tripe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm thinking more and more that Peckinpah is one of the most over-rated directors ever. I was quite looking forward to watching Straw Dogs especially since it had been banned for 18 years but it turned out to be a big disappointment. The film did not engage with me one bit and the characters and narrative were bland beyond belief.***SPOILERS ALERT***The story seems to lead us nowhere and whatever thought went into character motivations seems poor - one moment David and Amy seem happily married, the next he is asking her to leave him alone. I also can't understand what the point of the rape scene was either - I would have thought that that would have given David a lot of motivation, especially towards an act of violence. But it seems that this incident was completely wasted. As it turns out he never knows of the incident and oddly does not ask his wife why her face is battered and bruised when he gets home that evening.Instead, the story bumbles towards David having ended up protecting Henry Niles (played by David Warner who incidently went uncredited, the same as Dot Cotton apparently) from a mob of locals out to get him. And when they shoot and kill someone, start throwing stones at his windows, and batter down the doors, David seems even more intent on protecting him. Even though he knows that Henry has a history, even when he has just been told that he possibly killed a young girl, and even then when Henry tries it on with his wife! But does he hand him over? No, he kills off the mob of locals one by one and then gives him a ride home. Utterly preposterous.Something else I did not understand: "I didn't reckon on nobody getting killed," says one of the yokels just after the major has been shot. Okay, so they're realising that murder is a bad thing... So what do they then do? They ride around on tricycles and laugh like little girls. Um... what the... ? This is normal behaviour after you've just killed someone is it? This underlines to me that it is pointless trying to read anything into this film. Maybe Peckinpah had some things to say with this film. The problem is, I just can't be bothered to engage myself with the film.And what about the big fella when he wants another pint at the beginning of the film? He cuts the hand of the barman, has to be restrained by his friends, but then forces his way behind the bar and pours himself a pint. Hmmm... is that barman just a complete drip or something? I think I might just bar him for that!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still murky after all these years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally saw this in college some hum-hmm years ago and was annoyed at it then. Still annoyed. Peckinpah was better than this.The story's capsualized enough not to comment on plot beyond some schizophrenic moments. Peckinpah and Goodman, at times, really do seem to realize the situation Amy has been dropped into. She is David's little girl and as long as she is smiling and playing the pre-pubescent child he puts up with her. The moment she actually wants to be a part of the marriage, however, he plays the angry father. I say schizophrenic because Amy is quickly turned into provocateur, teasing the 'good old boys' by waltzing around in birthday suit, and eventually it appears--"gettin' what's comin' to her" with the rape by her ex boyfriend. The situation is badly handled--with the tired fantasy of a 'don't....stop' turned to 'don't stop'--and Peckinpah more concerned with the 'consensual' rape than the uglier one immediately following.David's character is often referred to as heroic for some twisted reason as well, and I shudder at the thought. His concern for a dead quail and for a pedophile (a strong performance by David Warner) is what drives him to defend his house.Ultimately, the weak spot of the film is the conclusion--and it is the true bog-like part. Hoffman's comment at the end is nothing more than words without meaning, drivel that may look good on paper but say nothing--and neither add to the situation nor explain what has happened for the prior twenty to thirty minutes.Finally, a word or two on the DVD. This film cries out for a commentary. Hoffman obviously is still with us, Susan George and Warner are still about. I don't know about Goodman. I'd seriously like to hear their thoughts on this as they viewed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wrong place, any time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can take the Western setting out of a Sam Pechinpah movie, but you can't take the discomforting and gratuitous violence. Gordon Williams' novel sourced this exercise in intestinal fortitude.The 'we don't want you around here' mantra is taken to extreme when an American wimp(professor) repairs to a rural British village with his new wife. There the locals are mostly thugs who do things their way, which is not anyone else's way, which is the way it always has been done. Their way includes rape, terrorism, intimidation, and forced submission. Take it or leave it.That Professor David Sumner(Dustin Hoffman) is ill-equipped to deal with anything but differential equations fuels this improbable set of circumstances. That his lovely, immature wife Amy (Susan George) plays the coquette for everyone within eye-shot is the spark. The following combustion is predictable, just add the signature Pechinpah touch of violence heaped on violence.Maybe this film is an ancestor to David Cronenberg's Crash, another film from a 'controversial' book, which wanders, and wanders, and wanders, tending to go for 'shock value' over substance.This movie has an incredible following, for me it does nothing, the premise so ludicrous I can't get past it to any of the psychology. The violence for me seems almost appropriate to the setting (man is that ever a horrible thought), there is no shock value. The unspoken subtext is that 'they are asking for it, and they are getting it', and when they get it we are to be surprised? Outraged? How can I be? Each new scene reaffirms those feelings in me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less than Credible Misogynistic Folk Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many problems with this movie not least the presence of Dustin Hoffman in the lead role. Hoffman completely out-acts this cast of British TV actors from the 1970s, he's almost in another movie completely. The film would have benefited from a more low key British actor, as the fact that he is an American has very little to do with the plot, any "outsider" would have serviced the narrative.The next problem, unsurprisingly, is Peckinpah's treatment of women, particularly the character of Amy, played by Susan George. I know it was the '70s, but Peckinpah is once again obsessed with violence against women but not in cinematic way, purely as a way to titillate. The lack of female characters only goes to underline Peckinpah's total lack of interest in women as fully developed people in his movies. As far as he is concerned they are whores there to service the other male charactersThe story is merely a set up for the last twenty minutes of poorly executed violence by a group of mentally challenged Cornish locals. Peckinpah's execution of the climatic scenes is woefully inadequate even for the early 1970s. I know Peckinpah bought some great innovations to the movies and even after this would make a couple of worthy efforts, but for me Straw Dogs doesn't work as a credible narrative, or a worthwhile cinematic experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the name Dustin Hoffman comes on table, people instantly talk about Kramer vs Kramer or Rainman and bestow all the plaudits on this twice Oscar winner for his phenomenal performances. Yeah Yeah!! It's with maturity good actors act better (exceptions some megalomaniacs). But the signs of virtuosity are evident of great actors in their earlier roles. "Midnight Cowboy" is one of the early movies of Hoffman that I became his fan. Now with 'Straw Dogs' he substantiated why he is always put in the list of all time greats."Straw Dogs" was made in 1971 and got heavy criticism ( and a later ban) for it explicit contents (rape and violence). But now that the world has seen Saw series and other filthy bloodshed gores, 'Straw Dogs' is like 'Titanic' infront of them.But don't dismiss this movie as sexist or violent movie. 'Straw Dogs' gives immense importance to character development of a man (Hoffman) from a mellowed and cowed down self to a violent retaliating one when his self-esteem is being challenged. Hoffman's performance as the silent mathematician transforming into explosive man in protecting his own house and honour from a gang of ruffians is simply outstanding. When the gang attacks his house his determined but clueless reactions to protect his house (that symbolizes the man's honour) is one of the finest points of the movie.The direction by Sam Peckinpah is affecting and engrossing. Especially, check the sequence of rape where Susan George struggles to find the balance between her erotic lust for her former lover and a moral dilemma that wrecks her honour as a married woman.A great, even if dated, movie.</fullReview>

That is where Charlie fits in!! Also Dustin Hoffman's David character seems to put Amy in the position to be alone with Charlie - very strange! All that said Charlie I forgive but not Norman Scutt - He is a Criminal!!

		<fullReview>Dustin Hoffman was young then, young and slightly mellow, maybe even plump. In this film he has a delicate role and he is learning the trade. He has to be both a mathematician immersed in his maths and a husband reacting to his wife's feeling of insecurity. When the local neighbours become aggressive, killing their cat and hanging it in their closet, then raping the wife, then attacking them at night because they are harbouring the local simpleton who was going to be lynched by the villagers, the father of the girl who had provoked him at the head of them with a fire-gun, he loses his calm and yet keeps his head. That makes an explosive cocktail that brings the local "authority" down dead, and then all the members of the lynching gang down dead or not far from it. Of course the beautiful renovated Irish farm does not have one window left and has suffered heavy damage. But the scientist-husband has managed to have the last word with these drunk hooligans and also with his wife, though she never said two of them raped her in the afternoon. But she is the one who uses a lying-about gun to kill the last assailant. She finally finds some courage instead of waiting for her dear husband to do it in her place. The film is quite bizarre though because it seems to show the Irish as being more or less whisky-bags or beer-bags, if we can use these words, and at the same time, the American wife is vain and seems to believe that her being married is going to make these men forget she had been mooching around with them during her vacations before being married. The American husband is both an intellectual engrossed in his own thinking, easily fooled by these locals who take him on an expedition hunting the snark on the heath, and an extremely cold-thinking defender of his home and wife, as well as of simple principles that make lynching an out of question solution to any situation. Dustin Hoffman cuts a very credible character in spite of his youth or because of his youthful naivety.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine &amp; University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>brutal Peckinpah style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director: Sam Peckinpah, Script: David Zelag Goodman, Peckinpah, Novel: Gordon Williams, Cast: Dustin Hoffman, Susan George.The Vietnam war resulted in the disillusionment of many Americans. Riots ensued and many Americans felt apathetic toward the government and society. This was evident in the music and films that were being produced after the late 1960's. Many brutal and controversial films where made in the 70's during and after the war. Films such as Last House On The Left (1972), Deliverence (1972), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and Day of the Women (1978). Straw Dogs (1971) is the film that really started this cycle. Their seemed to be this hippie vs. redneck attitude during this time. All these mentioned films deal with urban liberals (hippies) vs conservative country bumpkins(rednecks).Straw Dogs is about an American man,David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman)and his English wife Amy (Susan George). Trying to escape the problems of America, David and Amy decide to relocate to the village in the English countryside where Amy is from. Amy moved to the States, married an educated man (David is a mathematician), drives a fancy sports car, and now she thinks she is better than the people that she grew up with. She starts to flaunt her more sophisticated ways and her sexuality in front of the local man. Some of these men are hired to do repair work on the garage beside their house. The local men start to resent their more sophisticated ways. Things start to really go wrong when one of the locals,the village idiot, accidentally kills the daughter of one of the local men. David just abouts runs over him coming back home from the village one rainy night and he takes him in. The locals, wanting to get the man for killing the girl, come after David and put his house under siege and David is forced to protect his wife and his house.What made this film so controversial is its downright brutality and violence. When David is forced to protect his house, it gets very violent. Also, there is a point in the movie where the locals invite David to go bird hunting. While he is out hunting two of the men go back to rape Amy. This was the most graphic rape scene depicted in a film up to that time. This is a very powerful film to watch even today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not quite sure what to say about this film. it was interesting. i have encountered the kind of British "lads" that it depicts, and they are not often so clearly depicted. but it did occasionally sink into some kind of weird lady chatterly's lover/heartbeat cross over, which was thoroughly pointless and helped diminish the narrative drive. the story for those who don't know: David (dustin Hoffman) and Amy (Susan George) are on a quiet retreat from American life, living in a cottage in the British countryside. he is there to write a book on mathematics. but Susan has some kind of past with the natives, which is never quite explained. 4 of the locals are working on David and Susan's shed, repairing it, and while David it out hunting one day, one of them (who she seems to have some kind of past with) "rapes" here, and then assists his friend in sodomizing her. David remains oblivious to this occurring, even when the final confrontation comes, in which a couple of rowdy locals including the repairmen attempt to break into his house to kill a man accused of killing a local girl (its all a bit convoluted and i cant be bothered going into all the details). anyway, David finally makes a stand and refuses to move from his house, thus things even in a bloodbath. so, themes of violence, attacking the audience, blah blah blah. this was my first Peckinpah film, and i must admit i was not greatly impressed. a director renowned for his violent imagery, pushing the boundaries at a time when intense violence in the mainstream was largely unheard of, one must approach this film from the time it came from. but that still doesn't help it much. the first major problem: the rape scene. it is hard to tell if this film is sexist, or just trying to show some screwed up relationships. and it is hard to tell if it is just being exploitive or if it does actually have some meaning. unfortunately, i think it is both sexist and exploitive. the rape scene is totally pointless to the narrative, it never once comes into play, and doesn't even affect Susan's participation in the climax. this combined with the fact that it is clearly shown that while she does not want to have sex with the man, she still enjoys it (at least until she is anally raped by the other guy), points it in the direction of pure exploitation. the ending is quite impressively written and directed, paving the way for many films of this type, hell, even home alone can be seen to borrow from straw dogs. so while i found it interesting, and i think it is a reasonably important film in film history, i do not think it is a true classic. now, after watching it, i couldn't help but think of irreversible. both contain similar plot points and themes. but in irreversible, we have Gaspar Noe, a creator who understands destruction, who understands who to wield violence and drive it straight into our hearts so we cannot escape from it. Peckinpah, from what i have read of him, and after viewing this, his most controversial film, i don't think he is a creator. he is only a destroyer, and thus his films come out as they do, heading in one direction only, downhill into death and decay. and because he does not control destruction, only creates it, his vistas of violence are so overplayed that they become exploitive, and tap into our global mainstream unconscious joy for violence, thus a film like straw dogs CAN lead to a film like home alone. Noe on the other hand, because of everything i said above, he needs only one or two acts of violence to make us feel all the things we want or don't want, and because it is so painfully alive it will never become a cypher for entertainment in its most basic form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not deserving of its notoriety</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biggest question has to be why this film was banned for so long. Is the rape scene really that disturbing? Many worse scenes have been filmed since. Many have said that the most disturbing aspect is that Amy appears to enjoy the first rape. But is she actually raped by Charlie? He does not actually appear to force himself on her beyond tearing her clothes. It seems more like a willing moment of adultery than an actual rape, despite her half-hearted protestations. The second man does indeed rape her, but she is certainly not shown to enjoy that.The biggest problem I found with this film was the unsympathetic nature of the two principle characters. Until his final act of protecting Henry, David is arrogant, self-centred and rude (do Americans never actually say 'please' and 'thank you', or is it just that movie Americans never do?), with that typical (movie) American way of treating anyone who earns less than he does as a servant (and they talk about the British class system!). Amy is portrayed as equally self-centred and arrogant. These are just not people we can easily feel sorry for.The film is, quite frankly, extremely tedious until the final denouement. We see a group of stereotypical yokels (with appalling excuses for Cornish accents - didn't dialect coaches exist in 1971?) and an equally stereotypical arrogant middle-class 'outsider' couple not really doing very much. The violence at the end has been surpassed in many films since. Disturbing? Why is it so disturbing? This film certainly doesn't deserve its notoriety. It's not awful, but it's certainly not great either.And one question. The tagline says that seven men died. I only counted five male deaths (the four local yobs and the major). Who were the other two?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Straw Dogs (1971) **** (out of 4) An American mathematician (Dustin Hoffman) takes his English wife (Susan George) to a remote location in Europe so that he can get some peace and quiet to write a book but they find themselves being terrorized by a group of thugs led by one who use to date his wife. There's so much controversy surrounding this film that it's rather hard to tackle because, in my opinion, Peckinpah has created a whirling nightmare where no one is innocent and the director gives us so many layers upon layers that even if you feel one way there might be another scene that makes you think differently. This is a very demanding film as it's constantly giving you scenes to think about but then it keeps giving you more and more layers to think about. A lot of the controversy seems to come in forms of the wife and the rape scene. Did she want to be raped? Did she enjoy being raped? I'd answer them with a no but I do think this scene and its follow up play a very important message to the husband, which once again comes to light at the end of the film when the wife finds herself in trouble again. I think for the most part that the film is really about Hoffman's character and that the wife plays very little in it. The Hoffman character is seen as a wimp and a pushover until the very end when his animal instincts come out and he is forced to defend his home. Is Peckinpah trying to say that every man has a nature to kill? I think that's one of the layers this film goes for. No matter how you debate or rethink what the film is trying to say, I don't think there's any doubt that this is one of the most powerful films of the decade. Peckinpah's direction is brilliant throughout and especially in the end when all hell breaks loose and the director is able to build so much tension. I also love the pacing that the director uses as for the most part the film takes its time in telling the story. That's not saying the film is slow but it's a real character study where we get to learn and study Hoffman's character. The strongest aspect of the film is the terrific performance by Hoffman. You can watch any scene in the film and just be amazed at how Hoffman plays it. We see his character go through so many ups and downs and the actor pulls all of it off without an issue. Considering the roles Hoffman had been playing before this it's still amazing how much range he took here. The supporting performances are all very good with George and Del Henney shining the brightest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Straw Dogs is an American Masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Expertly crafted by Sam Peckinpah, the film is a challenging, complex, and compelling watch that will linger in your mind long after watching it. The entire cast is near perfect, with especially powerful performances from Hoffman and George. And the tense siege on the house is, quite simply, a masterful piece of action. I watched the Criterion DVD this time and it's one of their best releases I've seen. Among other things, it features an excellent commentary by Stephen Prince (who has written several books on film, including one on Peckinpah) and the documentary 'Sam Peckinpah: Man of Iron.' All in all, a great set for a great movie.</fullReview>

Since then I have always wanted to see it again but in England you can`t get it on Video let alone DVD for love nor money. I do not understand why in this era it is still BANNED it seems such a waste of a BRILLIANT FILM lost to 2-3 generations of film lovers in England.

		<fullReview>A sauced-up drunk bum, keeps everybody in the 25 population of an old English village, well.. sauced up, and on his own expense! (Though no explanation is given why he has endless funds, or why he is the bum of the village) Enter the completely brainless American (supposed intellectual played by Hofmann), who is married to the even more mindless Britt hottie, with the intellect of a 9 year old, whom everybody in the village where she originates from, pervs on her on a permanent basis (maybe because she is the only female in this village). No explanation is given why they got married, because it seems that they have only just met, and now they have moved to the dregs of nowhere in England to begin their immature and mundane lives together. And so begins the meek plot of these preposterously dim individuals meandering into complete boring oblivion.After trudging along for an hour, the feeble plot starts to show its bland face. For a while you think that this cannot be based on rational thinking human beings. But then it hits you like a clammy sack in the face: they really are telling the story this way! Nothing happens for most of the movie, the couple are attacked by the drunken village morons, and the movie ends. The stupidity of the characters never seize to amaze: Whilst the house is under siege by numerous armed men, braking windows and firing gun shots, the main character says to his wife: "Honey, you go to bed :), I'll tell them to go away.." The acting is not at all bad actually. There is also lots of excellent editing to convey the awfully stark point.. And that's why this movie gets a 3. Mostly it was disappointing because the characters are supremely stupid in everything they do (the main character is a mathematician with a grant!). This movie is highly acclaimed by many, and you would think there must be some reason why people think so, but there is not. Perhaps because of the violence and subject matter for the time, but that does not make it a good movie. It falls flat on all levels from the start, and as soon as you hope it will gain momentum and become something, it slips and falls flat, face first again... and by then you don't want to make the effort to lower your intelligence to really try and understand this ca-ca called Straw Dogs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The wild bunch harass a cowardly scholar and his juicy young wife in their country house. Surely it's the kind of material that vulgar Sam Peckinpah would put his hands on - sexpot gets raped, little people fights back violently.Some viewers find the final climax very exciting, but that's easy to make. You just break down the action with different camera angles, put in some slow-motion shots, then edit them as fast as possible. Usually it would win you an editing award in a film festival. So let's put aside the technical aspect and focus on what the characters do in the fighting sequence:Bad guy A shoots bad guy B in Susan George's bedroom.Dustin jumps on A, they roll down the staircase, and Dustin finishes him with an animal catcher while Susan STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STAIRCASE, shocked.Then Dustin goes out of the house to have some fresh air. When he comes back, she is STILL STANDING AT THE SAME SPOT appointed by the lousy director.All of a sudden bad guy C, out of nowhere, jumps on Dustin from behind. They fight toward the staircase, Susan runs upstairs, takes out a shotgun and kills the enemy. At this moment, she is back to THE MIDDLE OF THE STAIRCASE again.After that Dustin takes David Warner, a killer sheltered by the couple, downstairs, asking his wife if she's alright. Susan doesn't reply, STILL STANDING AT THE SAME POSITION.Dustin drives David to town, leaving her with several dead bodies in the house. Who would do such an idiotic thing to his panic wife? It's the most mindless direction I've ever seen.What a bloody bad movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A pacifist man (Dustin Hoffman) comes to a remote English village with his wife (Susan George) to work. The local toughs (including a former lover of his wife) keep trying to bait him and get him to fight back. He won't and the violence escalates.This was purportedly ahead of its time in 1971--it's very obvious and dated now. Also we now have the complete version here in the US (five minutes of violence were cut out to ensure an R rating in 1971). Times change--this movie was considered extreme in terms of the violence back in the 70s--now it doesn't seem that bad. In fact, the violence is pretty restrained!SPOILERS!!!!For instance...a man gets a bear trap in his neck and there's not a drop of blood. Come on! If that happened there would be TONS of blood! Also the films treatment of women is horrendous. George is slapped around and, in a truly disgusting sequence, eggs on a man to rape her and enjoys it (!!!)...until another man joins in. Portraying a woman enjoying being raped is beyond sick. Also, there isn't one likable character in the entire film. Hoffman comes across as a wimp; George as an annoying woman who gets what she deserves; the local toughs are sick cretins and Warner is a violent, mentally sick man. The dialogue is, putting it mildly, bad and I've never thought Sam Peckinpah was a great director ("The Wild Bunch" is way overrated). Also the movie moves very slowly and is downright boring at times. I'm giving this a 5 because the acting is good--but that's about it.Supposedly this film started a lot of controversy about violence and such back in 1971--but then the movie disappeared from sight. It should have stayed out of sight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A confused film about its themes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I know, the movie is mostly appreciated for its script, but ironically in my opinion all of the flaws or problems of the movie are because of the script! A gentleman moves to a new town with his wife, but a group of sinister men plan to rape his beautiful wife, the man will try to cope with it. Well, this isn't what we see in the movie. I will explain how. Firstly, the director couldn't give me the feeling that the town consists of some ignorant and macho men, I mean Peckinpah can't reflect that society well in the film. At the same time, the attitudes or the change of Dustin Hoffman's character isn't handled well, in other words, Peckinpah can't add enough depth in his characters or he doesn't examine society or social background of the "rape". This isn't a film which asks questions. In fact, it doesn't give us any answer either. Peckinpah isn't that type of director anyway. The chemistry between the two (Hoffman and Susan George) is pretty bad, at times unbearable. Also, a more experienced and famous actress could have played that role. I feel no sympathy for any character including one of my all time favorite actors, Dustin Hoffman's character. Also, rather because of the director's style, there was not enough heart and soul, but the story needs it. However, the most important flaw of the movie is the details behind the rape. Since the wife in the movie isn't a woman like Rocky's Adrian, she isn't really like a sufferer and that'a a big problem. However, it hasn't finished yet. There is a little twist in the rape scene and you can attribute it to Peckinpah. Other than these, by Peckinpah's macho approach, the woman in the movie is not one hundred percent innocent may be she is guilty either? Thus, you don't care about the husband's actions. If the movie tries to say that you need to be a macho man to protect your wife, No, I couldn't see such a message or theme in the movie. Then what? What is the message or messages of the movie? What does the movie try to say to us? The movie is also boring at times because of some unnecessary or unnecessarily long scenes which add nothing to the story. The cinematography is somehow a little bit muddy or let's say artless. Straw Dogs isn't a heroism story either. That's why I think that it is a confused movie from a confused brain. The movie has some Western elements, a few slow motion scenes as the director's fetish, but the story gets lost in the film without being suspenseful or exciting. And the very end of the film is weird.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Philosophically considering straw dog has much to say to us. The main topic is the stand point the mathematician against the right of the raping or caged man. His right is important to the mathematician.The bothering rape scene is not quite to understand as well. Did she want it is the big question ? A very hard one which can be answered maybe from the view point of it is both a yes and a no. Philosophical name for this is in between.This in betweenness of the fearful husband and courage man. Where as at the end of the film rules shift. The end of the film is also stunning. When the mathematician says I do not know the way to my home. Can this represent that he knows what happened to his wife. Probably yes and probably no.From this sense the film is all in between. Were the men coming to kill the raper are they right. Probably yes and probably no. DOes the wife in wanting the man to go out. Was she right probably yes and probably no.This proves that this is really a stunning and clear and also irritating film where as people found the rape scene irritating but at reality the whole film is irritating. Because of these ethical in betweenness.with love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a pleasant film, Peckinpah loses the plot in all the violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The video for this was banned in the UK in 1984 when the Government of the time introduced "A Video Nasties Bill" owing to the fact the a lot of films were being released to the relatively new fangled toy called VCR. None of these films had passed through the British censors and therefore remained uncut. So the Government took the drastic measure of banning nearly everything of a rather gratuitous nature.I bought Straw Dogs for a fiver in 1983 even though it is still technically illegal for me to own it. As to the reason for this prohibition: I can only guess the rape scene and perhaps the gratuitous violence at the end of the movie. Why the censors couldn't have simply erased the rape completely or at least sanitised it sans graphic detail, I don't know.However, when I first saw the video in 83 I was quite shocked at the rawness of the film; I found it hard to believe that local hooligans would be so determined to create so much havoc, mayhem and distress to a relatively subdued couple. The story is quite good: a weak mathematician chooses the quiet life out in the country with a rather frisky wife who wants more from her husband than just equations. Amy, is known to the locals and flaunts her sexuality both to flirt with the local men but also to see if this will spark any interest from Hoffman.The story moves on, the local thugs become more and more determined to not only beat the hell out of Hoffman but to repeatedly gang rape the woman,with devastating results at the end.I have seen many of Sam's films and in nearly all of them I can understand the nature &amp; the need for the primitive-like violence, especially from the Wild Bunch, where the wild west was a living hell anyway.But in Straw Dogs I felt he had lost the plot at an early stage. The message was made clear to all of us more or less right at the beginning, we didn't need to have it repeatedly rammed down our throats with more graphical signposting.The rape was totally unnecassary, in fact the entire treatment of Amy is unacceptably sexist &amp; ugly. Peckinpah could have held back and instead used subtle hints rather than brutal closeups to get the message across, and the result is nothing more than a voyeur's trip of a lifetime.Similarly the violence at the end. Again totally over the top and explicit and probably would never happen in real life, and that's the problem with this film. The sense of revenge is taken wholly out of context to be replaced with excessive violence that seems completely out of place.Hoffman probably feels quite guilty about this film 30 years on. He tries to convince as the weak teacher turned homicidal maniac past his breaking point, but somehow we are left in a state of disbelief. And to some extents he deserves some punishment for the way he treats his own wife.Of course this film was made during the end of the swinging 60s where sex, violence &amp; pretty girls equaled strong box office. It would be a sad reflection on the great Peckinpah if these considerations played on his mind during the making of this rather ugly unfashionable movie.**/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a suspenseful film about an American couple who are pushed to the limit with the local bullies in a English village. Part of the suspense comes from the fact that Hoffman's character is such an unimposing character that logically, things would have to go to the extremes it does for him to react like this.Unfortunately, Susan George's character is the biggest strike against the film. She is a whiny, inconsiderate wimp who is a constant irritant most of the time in the film. She displays no strength of character whatsoever as when she is sexually assaulted and does not tell her husband. That violation colours her next actions during the climatic siege, but she still refuses to explain herself during that sequence. Instead what she mainly does whimper, scream and dither to the point where Hoffman's character has to physically threaten her to make her help him defend their home. She garners no respect and is a vile stereotype for the most of the film.That alone discourages me to a good degree from trying Sam Peckinpah's other films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STRAW DOGS tells the story of an American couple settling in northern England to start a new life away from the daily grind. Dustin Hoffman plays David Sumner, a mathematician on a scholar grant to work on a thesis about stars. His young wife, Amy (who is a native of northern England) used to date one of the locals and flirts with him at every chance she gets. Some of the locals are doing some remodeling on Mr.Sumner's house, but these hoodlums only mean trouble, as they lust for his wife. About halfway through the film, things start getting tensed up, as the locals start vandalizing sumner's house. Despite all of this, David Sumner is a man that does not vow to violence and thus tries to find a civilized solution for the problem, despite the fact that his wife starts calling him a coward. STRAW DOGS, from 1971, is a very slow moving picture and if there's any controversy about it is the way the characters act out the situations, which puts the question of what would you or I had done if we were in the same situation.I don't think this movie has stood the test of time as well as other movies from the era, such as DELIVERANCE, GODFATHER, THE DEVILS and the mighty A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. There is an "infamous" rape scene that maybe for the period it was shown it would look a bit outrageous, but looks positively "tame" by todays' standards or even compared to brutal scenes in DELIVERANCE or THE DEVILS which are from the same time period. And the final "bloodbath" scene is not nearly as brutal as you might think. There's a very "sixties" quality to the film that I can't fully describe in words and the bloodshed is very limited and certainly nothing as brutal as say MARATHON MAN (which Hoffman starred a couple of years later). If anything, you feel enraged by how David Sumner's character handles the situation during the final scene. This movie is being sold as a man's fall into ultra violence but the result is far from that. STRAW DOGS is NOT a bad movie. It's just OVERRATED, SLOW MOVING and has NOT aged well compared to other films of the era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is my house!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all of Sam Peckinpah's films I think that this is easily his most thought provoking and anyone who was offended by it really missed the point. Story is about David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman) who is an American astro-mathematician with an English wife named Amy (Susan George) and he is on a sabbatical and they have rented a house for the year in Cornwall where Amy was brought up. David gets no respect from the towns people and the group of men building a roof for his garage toy with him and flirt with his wife. One night they discover that their cat has been killed in their bedroom and Amy wants her husband to do something about it. But David is a pacifist and a coward and while talking to the workers they invite him along on a hunting trip. While hunting one of the men goes back to Davids house and while talking to Amy he rapes her. And then a second worker shows up and he rapes her as well. Amy doesn't say anything about it but David does fire all of them. Meanwhile, a local man named Henry Niles (David Warner) who is mentally disturbed and has a history of sexual assault goes on a walk with a young girl and he chokes her to death. David and Amy are driving home that night and its foggy and David accidently hits Henry with his car injuring him. They take him home and try to call a doctor but the gang of men and the dead girls father come and want to take Henry. David refuses to hand him over and now he must defend his home! The characters in this film are very well defined and the casting is exceptional. Hoffman is perfectly suited to play a nerd like man who is seemingly surrounded by men who are at least two times bigger than he is. His character seems to be hiding from things and he tries to hide his fears in his work. He picked a small city in England for a reason. And Susan George gave maybe the most interesting performance in the film. She loves her husband but obviously doesn't like everything about him. At first she is horrified by the rape, then is turned on by the brutish nature of her attacker but when the second man shows up she realizes how inhuman they all are. I've always been a big fan of George and even though she made a lot of dreck, this is probably her best performance. It is a complex role and she's up to the task. The story of this film is reminiscent of something John Boorman would make. But this is a Peckinpah film and you can make a case that its his best film besides "The Wild Bunch". Like a lot of his films, violence is used as a metaphor. Its not just an excuse to make an action film. Violence is the main point of the film. The violence is there so we can see how these characters react to certain situations and Peckinpah made it an art form. Very thought provoking script gives the viewer a lot to discuss when its over. Hoffmans character is a pacifist but he must resort to violence to save not only his home but himself and his wife. Technically very well made and the location shooting add deep flavor to this interesting film. A must see!</fullReview>

For a long time, such directors as Peckinpah and Stanley Kubrick endeavored to assault audiences' sensibilities by showing just how horrifying violence really was, or so it seemed. In The Wild Bunch, for instance, it appeared Peckinpah wanted to show what it was like to get shot to death in a manner which hadn't been shown before. Moreover, the setting is appropriate for all the ensuing mayhem provided the movie is set mostly in Agua Verde on the eve of World War 1. Straw Dogs is set in Cornwall, England and marks his first foray out of the western. The Cornish setting, while not bad, makes the unrestrained violence seem all the more gratuitous and incongruous. The Wild Bunch further benefited from better acting, a well-written script and more exciting action and realistic violence. At the very least, The Wild Bunch jelled and had a point. Contrary to The Wild Bunch, Straw Dogs suffers from a simpleminded script and lame characters. Not only that, the acting isn't particularly good and the usually stunning Dustin Hoffman comes off as rather wooden in the film. His co-star, Susan George, delivers an excruciating performance which serves to trouble and annoy viewers further. The remaining cast is generally stiff.The movie is virtually plot less as it merely involves mathematician David Sumner's (Hoffman) move to Cornwall for no reason other than he longs for peace and quite to help him in his effort to write a treatise on celestial navigation. Inevitably, trouble ensues with the locals and, through a series of bizarre coincidences, David must defend his home. The result is a relatively pointless movie given especially how David can be interpreted in several ways. One could argue that he was a pacifist if not a coward. Some, including Peckinpah, would assert that David was the film's heavy. However, producer Daniel Melnick once said that Peckinpah meant for the movie to be about violence and the senselessness of it and how everybody (including David) can be moved by it. Violence musn't be senseless if David enjoys the killing. This suggests that Peckinpah was confused with regard to the movie's intent. It helps to think the director arrived on the set drunk most of the time. At one point, he was even hospitalized with walking pneumonia. Without a sound theme or message, the violence of Straw Dogs seems especially gratuitous.Things are complicated further by the notorious rape sequence involving David's wife, Amy (George) and two men (one of whom was an apparent ex-boyfriend of Amy's). Much notoriety stems from the fact Amy presumably enjoys at least some of the assault. Ultimately, the rape scenes are revolting and pointless since David never really finds out. It can be further argued that he doesn't necessarily discover the animal instinct in him by the end if he never learns about the rape. There doesn't seem to be much special about Straw Dogs aside from the rapes, since man's instinctual capacity for violence was already covered in such films as Cape Fear and Lord of the Flies. More than anything, Straw Dogs seems to be just a study in depravity as nearly every single character appears depraved in some way. Worst of all, Straw Dogs is likely to incite acts of rape or sexual violence.The gratuitous violence of Straw Dogs is seemingly used in an effort to compensate for its lame characters, poor script and wooden acting. Straw Dogs is full of remarkably stupid characters who never seem to do or say much. By the time the siege arrives, most of the characters lumber about. It's ridiculous to think that David could keep all five of them out of the house even if they were slow-moving. The entire sequence just seems like a set-up to allow more variety in the gratuitous violence. It never helps that Cornwall is a most inappropriate setting for such over-the-top mayhem. Before the final denouement, the film plays like a dreadful soap opera with slow-witted cretins and a horrid rape sequence thrown in for good measure. Amy (George) is a prototypical blonde bimbo who tries to be smart. Throughout the siege, she is so stupid that all she could say to David repeatedly is "give them Niles." Only David, the reverend, the magistrate and the boisterous rat-catcher are at least somewhat intelligent. With the exception of Chris (Jim Norton), those hooligans were clumsy and dull when they should be more menacing or interesting. Charlie (Del Henney), with his over-sized face and brawny features, is every woman's worst nightmare while Norman (Ken Hutchison) is a dumb sodomist. Phillip (Donald Webster) is just a slow-witted trucker. The equally fat Tom (Peter Vaughan) is no more than an old mobster who blames everybody else, including the magistrate, for the impending violence. Equally disappointing is the dumb Janice (Sally Thomsett), Bobby (Len Jones), John (Peter Arne) and, especially, Henry (David Warner). Either these characters are rather poor, or the acting is. Warner's character is a special disappointment considering the great actor is capable of so much more. All violence in Straw Dogs still seems gratuitous.There are also hints of incest and pedophilia. Since Straw Dogs is supposedly a study of violence, the misogyny and sexual perversion only ruins it further. Why on earth does anyone admire this stupid, pointless shock film?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chauvinistic disregard in an otherwise very well constructed theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wild Bunch pretty much sent me towards instant Peckinpah fandom, sending me of course towards this movie, which as I understand it was supposed to be another analysis of the role of violence in Western cultures. Instead it comes off to me as more of a misogynistic and masochistic portrayal of a man becoming a Man.Before I go further, let me point out that the tension and build-up of events in this film is spectacular. I can definitely see why this film is highly regarded and why it's a favorite of Peckinpah fans. Also, the ending is really fun, the same way zombie movies where the protagonists are stuck in a house and everything's falling apart are fun. I don't know what it is about that plot device especially that is so appealing, but it might have something to do with Hoffman's line in this movie, "This is my house, and I'm not letting them in!" However, this film reinforces the "Rape victim must have secretly wanted it" myth, and I do not appreciate that. Sure, in 1971 rape wasn't very talked about and in fact many people didn't really understand it. However, that's not an excuse, that's a problem this society needs to get over. It's not just the rape scene itself, either, the same basic elements of the myth are alluded to in the way she treats the other men, the whole discussion of her refusal to wear a bra in the first half of the movie, and the pointed ambiguity of whom she is calling for help for at the end, David or Charles.Part of the whole problem with this treatment also involves the fact that honestly none of the characters are likable. I relate most to David because of his insecure treatment of pacifism and violence. I think he was actually a rather better developed character. But I don't think this movie gives any good reason why those two are in love with each other. They don't seem in any way supportive of each other's interests, love, or attraction except during token sex scenes. The other characters don't really seem to have any development but as angry or creepy respectively. I think a lot of the impact of this movie is lost in people most of us pretty much are supposed to hate from the beginning.During the end there's a real commentary on the nature of violence and law, as three forms of the relationship between the both occur: the de jure law of the policeman, which fails; the de facto law of the mob, which becomes a problem; and the necessary law of the vigilante protector of his own property, who eventually avails when pushed too far. These themes and others, along with the tone and movement in the construction of the movie lend itself to a very detailed analysis of violence and its purpose. That is why it's such a completely disruptive thing to bring it out in such a masculinized version with fallacious representations of women's "place".The fallacy eventually culminates in one of those classic clichés, the one where the protagonist and antagonist are wrestling while the weepy and obviously unkempt woman holds the gun and is, apparently, too weak to fire it herself without the urging of the protagonist. Ultimately this film is as much dismissive as it is admissive of disturbing elements of male violence, which is what disturbs me more than pretty much the rest of the themes this movie was intending.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absurd and laughable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had wanted to see 'Straw Dogs' for a long time. Being from the UK, I have been unable to see the film as it is banned on video there and very rarely shown at the cinema, if at all.The version I saw in America may be editted, I don't know, but there seemed to be gaps in terms of plot and continuity at various stages of this film.The basic out-line of this film, a timid American academic, David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman) living in Cornwall with his English wife, Amy (Susan George) being forced to resort to violent means in order to deal with a group of bullying locals, is straightforward enough. In the version I saw, there is no explanation offered on some of the arguments between the married couple. For example, a scene where Amy slowly summons up the courage to plonk some chewing gum on her husband's maths blackboard as an act of defiance has to be seen to be believed simply because it happens for no reason. Whether this is due to cutting or negligence on the part of Peckinpah, who knows?The main point of controversy in this film and indeed, the reason why it remains unavailable on video in the UK to this day is the rape scene of Amy where at turns, she appears to be terrified and gratified by this. This again appeared bizarre to me although I would imagine that this scene was slightly editted.The whole film is pretty dull but it does have an atmosphere about it where you know that it is all building up to something at the end.Unfortunately, the climax of this film is just a collection of laughable violence and fight scenes. The transformation in Hoffman's character is totally unconvincing as he goes from pathetic pacifist to tough guy who threatens to break his wife's neck in a matter of seconds.This film is silly basically from start to finish, it is poorly written and George doesn't stand up well to an actor of the calibre of Hoffman, who probably looks back on this film with a touch of embarrassment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard about the legendary violence in this film and rented it, back in the 80's when I was about 16 to watch it. I heard it was banned in England, so I thought watch out. Times change, and with horror movies where peoples heads get cut off (Friday the 13th), bodies get ripped apart (Aliens) this movie is tame. They could show most of this film on prime time. I do not know what it was like in 71, but the envelope is pushed way futher now. Baned in England? Why? It did not make the people in Scotland or where ever look good in the film, maybe thats why. It has the same effect as Deliverence did to the South. They never lived it down. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film about crises and expectation. About England after Whig era and about solutions to survive. About murder as ordinary gesture and fear as only way to protect you. A realistic description of society and vain search of its sense, slice of social confusion and justice beyond the rules.The values are essential problem. Music, social shadows, competition between organized crime ethnic groups, week brother and the experience of Chechen war, the gray vision about existence and life as fight, image of wife and disillusions of rural town are parts of self definition.Durst Hoffstein is only actor of a cruel game and the thuggish realities are other part of war facts. After missions, gifts or fugitive relation, hope and small illusions, desire to be ordinary young man, pieces of success and end of myth, he is not surviver but judge of a deep crisis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak remake of "Firecreek"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a "Firecreek" set in the British Isles. Dustin Hoffman plays the mild mannered Jimmy Stewart character, who tries to protect a lame brain kid from a lynch mob of undesirables after an accidental killing. One problem is that this lame brain kid strangles a young girl, and it is difficult to see going to such extremes to protect him. The way around this is to make one of the undesirables a rival for his wife's affections. There are some decent subplots. It is reasonably interesting. The characters are pretty good. Still, it is unclear why Hoffman sadistically murders the least dangerous of the aggressors. It makes no sense at all. In fact, aside from the two older men in the climactic scene, none of the characters make a lot of sense, save the young girl's brother. When faced with him, Hoffman has his biggest inward struggle, and sympathizes the most with this character. But the die is cast, and there is no turning back. A weak remake of "Firecreek" Not as fun, not as cinematic. Not Peckinpah's best by far.</fullReview>

Yep, Cornwall :-) Don't worry, I am not sad now. I moved hare as my better half is from here.If anyone knows if Susan is bored and fancies a drink, feel free to let me know.

		<shortDescription>Not misogynistic, great satirical farce, black comedy, A+ film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why people call this film misogynistic. It has one female characters who acts on a whim. It has one male character who's failure to act on a whim makes him look like a fool. If anyone has seen Godard's Contempt, that might shed light as to the motivation of the female character. Sure SHE is a weak character but that isn't saying that women are weak. Peckinpah is showing the contradiction between the apparently weak American male and his supposedly liberated wife when in actuality, they are both human characters thrown in a situation where political correctness and proper social behavior are thrown away and that purely human, animalistic urge explodes. The rape scene was pretty controversial, if only because it seems like Susan George partly enjoys it but to criticize her is to criticize people in general for following their gut feelings of excitement. This is obviously the most extreme way to portray such a thing but, hey... Dustin Hoffman being too controlled led to the opposite affect and of course, you know how he reacted... it might seem sick to call a film with rape a comedy, but this is clearly social satire... the bear trap? Come on, laugh at humanity... seem nihilistic? Hardly, human nature still hasn't been able to control it's animal side. This is like a pre-cursor to Taxi Driver.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a film that has been banned for so long, this was not particularly violent, and is one of the more dated examples of early 1970s cinema.This is occasionally harrowing, and Susan George puts in the best performance as Amy Sumner, the battered wife of Hoffman's character David. The rape scene is by far the most harrowing part of this film, and Hoffman's timid David turns violent in a rather predictable manner towards the end.OK, but not one of Peckinpah's better displays.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost unbearable in its sexism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Susan George first enters the film carrying a nasty-looking device identified as a "man-trap," and that offensive little metaphor sets the tone for the entire film. While the rest of the story is watchable enough, Peckinpah's brutal treatment of Amy is almost unforgivable. All that she asks throughout the film is that her husband might give her a little attention, and the director punishes her mercilessly for daring to invade David's shell of masculinity. He only seems to notice her long enough to scold her like a child and have sex with her before bed. It is insulting enough to suggest that she would enjoy being raped in her own home (no apparently sometimes means yes in the filmmakers' minds), but to then punish her enjoyment with forcible sodomy is unthinkably repellent. The entire rape sequence, shot in lovingly graphic detail, suggests the attitude of "the bitch deserved it." Blaming a woman for being raped is beyond disgusting. Granted, her attackers eventually pay with their lives, but they are punished for violating David's home and property, a category that apparently includes Amy. David's cold-hearted rebuke of the woman in whose repeated victimization and humiliation he has been an instrumental part and his final smirk celebrate not only his reclaimed masculinity, but also his escape from the female "man-trap." Christ, these people even try to offer an apology for child molesters! Henry is lured into the alley by a sluttish adolescent who attempts to seduce him, her death at his hands is portrayed as entirely innocent, and David spends the finale defending him! I have always enjoyed Peckinpah before, and "The Wild Bunch" is in my top ten, but "Straw Dogs" is one of the vilest films I have ever seen, a celebration of misogyny masquerading as an important study of manhood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly violent but entertaining film Hoffman did for the power and the money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was indeed a very powerful and controversial film for the time but totally implausible. Dustin Hoffman is an American Academic that moves into a English country cottage with his very attractive , sexually demure wife played by Susan George. The very tough and sexist builders renovating the cottage ridicule Hoffman's character and leer at his wife. Susan George's character panders to the leers of the builder and actually knows one of them. She appears to very open to the builder she knows and she easily gets seduced and despite some initial resistance is seen enjoying sex with him until one of his mates joins in. In legal and moral terms it would be debatable if she was initially raped as consent appears to have been given from my recollection. Interwoven with this event is the wrongful accusation of a retarded man of rape of a young lady. Finally Hoffman's character comes under siege from the Town's folk and the alleged rapists and has to fend them off with fatal force. Not a very pleasant film and has a highly unlikely ending.But hey some people enjoy these sort of films and think that they have great qualities in their depiction of graphic violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is the original really better than the remake??? I don't think so !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched both the new and old versions of "Straw Dogs" in a single day and still fresh from the experience, I found that I identified better with the newer version?for me at least, the remake was more believable than the original, in terms of acting, character development and location? Simply put the English thugs in the original did not strike me as terrifying or menacing?to me they were more buffoonish and funny?I did not find them or their behavior to be particularly intimidating?in fact I felt they behaved in a pretty normal manner when confronted by the American and his seemingly strange mannerisms? If anybody came across as abnormal or psychologically disturbed, it was the main character's wife, who sends out mixed signals by deliberately displaying her panties and subsequently her bare breasts to the gang of leering men, then whining to her nonplussed husband and still later on treating the same men to beer?and the rape was not really a rape, as she does not put much of a resistance even seemingly enjoying it towards the end?she came across as a far more seriously disturbed, immature and dangerous character, more disturbing then the supposed antagonists of this movie?when she is being raped again in the climax, notice how she screams for her ex-boyfriend (who is one of the attackers) instead of her husband for help?this proves that the first sex episode in the movie was not entirely without her consent? The acting too was too exaggerated and cartoonish to be effective?I felt I was watching a parody instead of a serious horror movie?and don't tell me that was how movies were in the early 70s?I have watched older movies with far more convincing acting?I cracked up when Hoffman tries to stop Norman from assaulting the mentally disturbed guy in his house and Norman says "don't lay your hands on meeeeee"?the drawing out of the "me" was unintentionally comic?there were plenty of other moments in the movie where the outlandish acting was funny though not intended to be so? And I absolutely hated the character of the wife, who was silly, clingy, immature and adulterous; hankering unreasonably for her husband's attention and then ready to desert him when he needs her support the most?I would call her the main antagonist in the movie and her husband was too good for a skanky woman like her? The remake addressed and eliminated most of these negative points?the wife was much more sympathetic and her behavior more bearable? unlike Dustin Hoffman who seemed to be barely tolerating Susan George, James Marsden and Kate Bosworth acted realistically like a couple in love?the creeps were genuinely creepy, their behavior intimidating at times and their contempt towards the supposed wimpiness of the husband was barely concealed beneath a veneer of politeness?I could easily imagine myself in the shoes of the various characters and identify with them all? The intimidation and harassment aspect was better brought out in the 2011 version?it starts out subtly by having the workmen gang turning up for work far too early in the morning, blasting loud music, grabbing beer bottles from the refrigerator randomly, requesting for permission to leave work early... steps up relentlessly to the leering catcalls at a jogging Bosworth?and finally the hanging of the cat and the double rape?scenes where Chris asks Mr. Summer which movies he has written scripts for and Charlie warning David over walking out of the church sermon helped to build up tension between the characters...these were not present in the original version.The only aspects that the original scores over the remake is that Dustin Hoffman is much more of a nerdy and diminutive guy than James Marsden?you could relate to Hoffman as a guy who would have been constantly bullied and pushed around since his school days?but not so much with the muscle-bound, square-jawed Marsden (even if he wears spectacles to look nerdy)?and the final battle in the original movie was more edgy and realistic then the newer version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there has ever been a more over-interpreted and stolidly misinterpreted film than director Sam Peckinpah's 1971 Straw Dogs, I've yet to encounter it. Yes, films like Citizen Kane and 2001: A Space Odyssey have had more ink spilled over them, but most of the ideas tossed about are on the money, and far less is read into them. Also, they have one big thing going for them that Straw Dogs does not. They are great films. While Straw Dogs is not nearly as good a film as its hagiographers claim- for Peckinpah had all the subtlety and psychological depth of a sledgehammer, nor is it as irredeemable a bit of pornography as it detractors insist, it is, above all, a very dull and mediocre film. This is not a word- dull, that has likely ever appeared in a review of the film, but what else can one call a film that telegraphs its end in the first twenty minutes, and has all the realistic character development of a Warner Brothers Roadrunner cartoon? Excuse me: let me rescind that. Wile E. Coyote, at least, plumbs some true existential angst.By contrast, the nearly two hour long Straw Dogs is not even that innovative and certainly not 'naturalistic,' for the ultra-violence it depicts was done better (and strangely, even more realistically) in Stanley Kubrick's deeper and darker humored A Clockwork Orange- released the same year, and earlier by Peckinpah, in The Wild Bunch, by Arthur Penn, in Bonnie And Clyde; its scenes of cretins trying to break into the lead characters' home are pale echoes of George Romero's masterful low budget Night Of the Living Dead, and even the Vincent Price horror classic, The Last Man On Earth (and it's remake, the Charlton Heston vehicle The Omega Man); and the revenge theme done more engagingly in Wes Craven's campy debut film Last House On The Left- sans the guilty pleasure, and more deeply in the film Craven was inspired by, Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring. It acted, however, as a springboard for other films showing increasingly stylized violence, such as Deliverance (1972), Death Wish (1974), and Taxi Driver (1976)- films with different styles and artistic merits. As well, the film's politics and psychology are badly dated. This is especially true in the infamous 'double rape' scene. Compared to Alfred Hitchcock's Frenzy, released a few months later, Peckinpah's motivations seem downright silly, which is especially noteworthy since Hitchcock built a career on Freudian pseudoscientific motivations for his criminal characters, yet abandoned that all for realism in his under-appreciated 1972 gem?. In short, being controversial does not always equate with quality, and Straw Dogs seems more and more like a puerile attempt to simply shock (which it no longer even does), yet one with pretensions of something deeper- it is an OK B film with a better pedigreed director and A film production values. Ironically, that very lack of pretense is why a film like Last House On The Left works better, and a film like Night Of The Living Dead touches far deeper into the human psyche and far richer into true art. Shock filmmaker David Fincher (Fight Club), a manifest Peckinpah acolyte, once said, 'I'm always interested in movies that scar. The thing I love about Jaws is the fact that I've never gone swimming in the ocean again.' Well, aside from his love of a rather routine and trite Steven Spielberg thriller (though the director seems to have gone all downhill since then), Fincher's dictum is not met here, for even the controversy of the alleged 'double rape' and the violent ending seem, nowadays, to be much ado over very little, as not a single image sticks out in viewers' minds, not even the film's blurred opening of kids in a playground, which quotes Peckinpah's earlier The Wild Bunch. When an artist cannot even equal his earlier glories it's a sure sign of a lesser work of art. That's what Straw Dogs is, no matter how one interprets its inner workings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vile, Offensive, Depressing and Degrading study of a Civilization in Decline.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This disturbing and angry look at society is a retread of what Truman Capote had so brilliantly wrote with "In Cold Blood", the story of a family brutally slaughtered by two animalistic human beings. It is also a live action version of a human being in place of the three little pigs locked in his brick house with a bunch of wolves trying to blow his house down. Dustin Hoffman plays an American man working in England as a scientist with a British wife (Susan George) who moves to the English country and find brutality at the hands of the men they hire to fix their house. These obvious rejects from "A Clockwork Orange" start off with light-hearted indications of their dislike for Hoffman, then gradually work up to more malicious acts, eventually raping his wife in a horrific scene which actually tries to indicate that she is enjoying it! Earlier, George was seen baring her breasts to the working men out of some sense of boredom as her husband works on his experiments as he gets impatient with her constant interruptions. This explodes into a confrontation with the cowardly Hoffman having stood enough and a violent conclusion.The violence in typical Sam Peckinpah fashion is inhumane and nasty, and the constant laughing and horn-tooting of one of the more psychotic men on a bicycle will leave you with a migraine. As this is considered a cult classic, I forced myself to get through it with abject horror as the story unfolded and the bullying went from nasty to absolutely evil. No real motivation is revealed for these men's behavior, and there is absolutely no passion between Hoffman and George. You have to really look at society with absolute disgust in order to enjoy this film, and if this is considered art, I'll stay with stick figures and Saturday morning cartoons. The early 1970's were difficult enough to get through without seeing what was already being shown on the news, and this multiplies the horrors of reality 100 times. These creatures who harass Hoffman and George are like the zombies of "Dawn of the Dead" before they joined the undead. While the degradation of society is a fact of life, here it becomes really too harsh to take and almost a parody of what is on the news even now. The result is an ugly monster of a movie that violates all dimensions of what is supposed to be entertainment and taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every so often I'll get to watch a "classic" movie with a great rep that for some reason or another, I just haven't viewed yet, even me being such a huge movie fan, who knows his stuff. "Straw Dogs" is one of those, and boy oh boy, what a hunk of garbage this slop turned out to be.Naturally, as with other "great" films that are really crap, fans of the film will inevitably say I "didn't get it" or "it is over my head" or some other nonsense like that. Please, to those with that in mind, give me a freaking break. This film is crap.It doesn't "mean" anything, it's not an excursion into "intellectual film-making" with "profound messages," it's just a very boring, sloppy, dull, poorly directed and shot hunk of crap.I won't go over the dull story as others have done it here, and you probably know the plot already. First of all, this film is super-boring, excruciatingly boring. It has a build-up that can put you to sleep unless you admire how pretty Susan George is. And even that whole marriage is unrealistic - Susan's character obviously goes for guys not like Dustin Hoffman's wimp at all, so why are they even together? The direction is so poor, I don't care who the director is, he sucks here. Choppy, sloppy, it's a mess.It even insults your intelligence. For instance, when Susan George is at the town gathering, she is really upset about being raped, and just in case you are too stupid to figure that out on your own, flashes of the rape appear on screen as the camera stays on her troubled face. Oh, thank you for that reminder, I thought she was just upset to be in such a crappy movie.You know what's funny? Susan George's "Dirty Mary Crazy Larry" is often dismissed as drive-in B-grade stuff, while that film is infinitely better made, tightly directed, and scripted. But back to the "Straw Dogs" classic. The rape isn't shocking, and the "violence" at the end isn't either. I've seen Saturday morning cartoons much more violent. The turnaround of Hoffman's character is completely unbelievable. His quotes about protecting his house are unintentionally hilarious.Really, I can go on but what's the point? Everyone who thinks this film is so "deep" and "intellectual" is going to completely disagree with me, while others who do agree with me don't need me to point these things out anyway about this overrated "film." I guess the point is to just let off steam that I actually wasted a small part of my life watching this garbage.If you want to watch a film that really is somewhat intellectual and has a man going crazy and killing people, watch "Massacre At Central High," which is one thousand times superior than this hack craparama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the hell did I just watch....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was in simple terms really stupid. It's one of those awful movies overhype by dimwits and paid off film critics.The characters were assanigned and boring. The dialogue was just stupid and unimaginative. The story was very hollow and in the end, had no real point.The wife is a flewzy that enjoys being forced to have sex. To call the ENTIRE sex scene a rape scene is completely inaccurate. She resists the first man but indeed wants the sex. It is earlier revealed that this is the same man she lost her virginity to, and in the same manner.....can you say, sexual patterns? Can you also say, closet whore?? I mean they are even cuddling afterwards and she blatantly gets into and enjoys the sex. .....they even try to get this guys character to come off as sensual and caring! However.... The second man comes in and rapes her while the first man helps.Then we have her husband. A cowardly nerd that has testicles the size of a fruit fly. It's no shocker his wife enjoys date rape with a cold fish like him. He wimps out of passionate sex and is constantly throwing temper tantrums, which generally are directed at his flewzy wife.This film is by no means artistic, well written or even remotely entertaining! It's really stupid and very sick.The writer and director are quite simply weirdos with a gross sexual disposition. I think this film was more about depicting bizarre sexual scenarios than anything because of the time it was made. The characters and storyline are really poor and just plain stupid!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch out for the bear trap...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film reminded me so much of "A History of Violence" which pretended to be a close study of violence and violent behavior but ended up just being nothing short of a cheap action movie masquerading as some thinking film on violence. Dustin Hoffman and his new British bride move to a small English town and encounter endless harassment from the local drunks who do nothing but hang at the pub all day and make trouble. Don't these men have a job? Anyway, Dustin takes all he can take and by the end of the film he holds up in his house and fights off each one of the drunk attackers by such gruesome means as boiling whiskey poured over someone, feet being blown off by a shotgun and someones head getting caught in a bear trap. Funny that someone would have a need for such a large bear trap in a small British town except maybe put a mans head in it.Sam Peckinpah who made the "Wild Bunch" which also covered the topic of blood letting violence in which no one was spared. But it was done with style, and you believed it. Straw Dogs is not believable. First of all the location is wrong and does not work. Why place it in England? I would think maybe in some inner city location or a small town in the American South in the 1930's or something. Second it is not in my view ever really explained clearly why these men are so quick to violence except maybe they got drunk and felt a need to kill Hoffman and rape his wife.Sam Peckinpah missed the mark on this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peckinpah tries to do a Kubrick, fails</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peckinpah's violent story of an American mathematician (Hoffman) on a sabbatical with his wife who is raped by her ex-boyfriend and his croney. Through a series of unconvincing coincidences, town psycho David Warner (who tentative portrayal is just a case of poor direction, for he's a highly competent actor if given some leash) ends up holed up in their house and Hoffman has to fight off the same rapists and their disturbed relatives.Not enough payoff for hours of build-up. The film's attitude towards its own violence is itself sickening -- it is pretentious and at the same time has turns worthy of the most obvious B-horror. A lot of people have compared this movie to S. Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange".... this is only true in the sense that Sam Peckinpah was trying to make a good movie along the same lines, but he failed miserably. Hoffman is just not believeable in this part, the action is too extreme and improbable, and the drama is not effective because we don't care about his character. If that's supposed to incite an ethical dilemna in the audience well, for me it doesn't. I don't root for the guys going after him; I just lose interest in the movie, which is much too long anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How NOT to make a film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!Probably one of the most mind-numbingly boring, slow-moving, dragging, unrealistic, and I stress UN-realistic, pieces of garbage I've ever wasted two hours of my life watching. Seriously folks, I don't know how this dull, idiotic waste of film is considered a classic. Either Dustin Hoffman was high on coke and weed when he agreed to star in this mess or he owed Sam Peckinpah a favor because it was absolute CRAP with a capital "C." After an almost two- hour build-up, the supposed "banned violence" starts, only it's just another 10-12 minutes of more unrealistic actions. I don't know what the script looked like, but the editing made the movie an incoherent mess. Literally, from one scene to the next, it felt as if I just walked in half-way through the movie or the DVD skipped a chapter or two. Yes, it's THAT bad. The "rape" scene wasn't even much of a rape, since she didn't fight off the rapist and enjoyed it. Made no sense to me at all. People that try to explain the "rape" are clueless, because no matter how you slice it, it still makes NO SENSE. I blame this really unbelievable, incoherent scene (and the whole crappy movie) on the very weak, slow, boring script, but ultimately, on the director (Sam Peckinpah) who disproves his legendary praise with this terrible film. No wonder NO ONE ever heard of this movie. I kept waiting and saying to myself "It's gonna get better, it's gonna get better" but it sure as hell didn't. It only p****d me off for forcing myself to watch the whole thing. The only saving grace is that I got it from Netflix so I didn't waste any hard-earned money on it. Seriously people, if you're thinking of seeing this film, do yourself, your mind, your eyes, a favor and SKIP IT!. Trust me. If you want to be bored to sleep, go ahead and watch it, but remember that I tried to warn you beforehand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing....Why did i watch this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read about this movie a few years back. It mentioned that it was one of Dustin Hoffmans Greatest roles in his top 10 movies. The movie came on Channel 4 last year, and after watching this film. All i can say is that it was terrible, disturbing and not worth watching. The only thing good about the movie is Dustin Hoffmans powerful performance. The rape scene was very disturbing and sick. The movie would of been OK if they edited out the rape scene. They didn't have to show the whole thing, completely unnecessary. The ending action was not that great, could of been improved. Overall, this was worse then A Clockwork Orange. Not recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Straw Dogs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard about this film in the past, mainly because of the leading actor, and then I found it listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I am glad I watched it a second time to get a proper opinion, directed by Sam Peckinpah (The Wild Bunch, Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid, Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia). Basically American astrophysicist/mathematician David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman) and his English wife Amy (Susan George) have moved to the small isolated village of Wakely in Cornwall, to escape the Vietnam- era social chaos in the United States. Their presence however provokes antagonism among the village's men, especially bullying and taking advantage when they are hired to do construction, and the hostility escalates from routine bullying to the gang rape of Amy. David is a pacifist, he is opposed to war and violence of any kind, Mary accidentally hits handicapped local villager Henry Niles (The Omen's David Warner) with her car, they take him into their home, the hooligans soon attack the house. David is backed into a corner by the actions of the men, he is forced to take a stand and finally resorts to he gruesome violence he abhors, the situation becomes a bloody battle, in the end all the men are taken care of, and David and Amy drive away, taking Niles with them. Also starring Game of Thrones' Peter Vaughan as Tom Hedden, T.P. McKenna as Major John Scott, Kes's Colin Welland as Reverand Barney Hood and Father Ted's Jim Norton as Chris Cawsey. Hoffman does well as the mild-mannered man having his manhood tested, George is fine as well, you do question the much debated rape scene, it does look like she was unconsciously "asking for it", this aside this was one of the big controversial violent films of the decade, alongside A Clockwork Orange and Dirty Harry, it is hard to watch at times, horrible men torturing the innocent couple, and a fair amount of bloody stuff, but it is an interesting psychological thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Jerry Fielding. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No redeeming factors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I'm a Peckinpah fan,he's one of my favourite directors of all time.He's given me some near-life changing moments with his films over the years. Sadly,this piece of crap isn't one of them.Where to begin?I've read that the production down in Cornwall was beset by the usual problems encountered on a Peckinpah film at this stage of his career; studio interference,Peckinpah's drink/drug fuelled paranoia,firing of crew members/production staff etc,etc. But there can be no excuse for this badly made(yes,badly made)D-movie. The painfully slow build up,the fact that the film contains not one sympathetic character,the TV soap script,and the "rape"(how can it be rape if she "likes" it?)scene followed by the inevitable shoot out. OK,we know that Sam could'nt write woman,not many of his contemporaries could either,but the scenes leave a particularly nasty taste. What was he trying to say,that needed to be said so crassly? Susan George played the same role in several other schlockers around this time,she should hang her head in shame. As I said above the film is badly made,the editing, photography,and acting make it look like an episode of "Tales of the unexpected". What a waste. All I can think is that the ban has elevated this film way,way above it's station. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peckinpah's efforts were in vain!!!!Atrocious movie (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie was a painful exprience.This movie raises many a question as to the blatant mysoginy of this director. Should this film be forgiven simply on the premise that it was made in 1971 and not 2001? Perhaps! but was this a man who coud not see women as equals.Lets' go to 1971, a time where women's movements were rampant and Peckinpah comes up with a film like this which basically said a woman was more useful if she wasn't wearing a bra!!!Amy(Susan George) is portrayed as a childish whining woman who for the love of God can not see sense and leave her cowardly husband played by Hoffman. The two ways in which I see it is this: Amy sees her husband as a whiny old boring fart whilst David sees Amy as a spoilt little madam. How they ever got together is beyond me. The character pairing is ludicrous. the way the director includes the scene where Amy flashes her breasts, it's alamost in a teasing way such that when she does get raped by two of them it almost makes it impossible to feel sorry for her as she brought it on herself. Did anyone notice how Amy called out Charlie's name (one of the rapist's) when the other one was trying to attack her again. What the hell was that all about??? It almost makes the first rape by Charlie ambiguous and "acceptable". Is this how Peckinpah interpreted this film...."as the portrayal of emotional complexities...." Not to mention the shocking instance where it appears that Amy is actually enjoying being raped. That was just the last straw to an already impossibly shyte movie.Looking at the big picture he was intimating that women enjoy being raped. That has far more implications than his sorry excuse for a film.The ending is simply ridiculous. David goes on a bender and takes out all the bad guys and saves the day....tosh!!!!!utter tosh!!!!This movie basically says that in order to win a woman's respect you need to have a larger package and mow down guys who are way bigger than you!0.0009999/***** That was for the opening sequence which was so-so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe that such an awful movie got a rating of 7.7! It seems more like ballot box filling by the Brits.The story line itself is deceptive. Until Sumner makes a stand there was no harassment from the locals. I wonder how Sumner got the grant to do research on maths when he is so stupid. To achieve something similar one would expect the recipient to be more mature and responsible.Marries a woman who has mental age of 14/15 who has got a permanent sad and painful expression on her face as if she is suffering from a bad case of piles.The other characters are quite authentic and believable from my own first hand experience.Over all an awful movie that I wasted 2 hours on.In future I must take IMDb ratings with a ton of salt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sam Peckinpah is overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah, you heard me. I said Sam Peckinpah is overrated. He may be a director who knows how to stage action scenes, but I'll be damned if he doesn't know how to MAKE A GOOD FILM. What's this film about, you ask? Well, in a nutshell, it's about an American mathematician named David Sumner (played by the always capable Dustin Hoffman) who has moved to the U.K. with his wife Amy, and promptly gets bullied around by a group who takes advantage of him when he hires them to do construction. So, like any loving husband, he gets very angry at the end and blows most of them away with a shotgun. And the police apparently don't question him either, seeing as how the movie just ends before we resolve the matter of ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LYING DEAD AT THE SUMNER HOUSE AND THAT GIRL WHO'S LYING DEAD IN A BARN. There's also the matter of Amy getting raped by one of the men, and she doesn't even bother telling David about her incident. Thus, David goes on a rampage at the end of the film because he's very, very angry. Kind of like the Incredible Hulk.Anyway, I should say that this film is just boring to me. I don't really care if some of you agree with me, but that's what I think. David's "outbreak" is pretty tame compared to some of the movies today, and compared to something like Kill Bill, the violence in this film is amateur (although, the guy who got his head caught in a bear trap did have some merit). Sam Peckinpah may have made good westerns, but this is just slow as hell. I just kept fast-forwarding through it until I got near the end, and THEN something started to happen.Bottom Line: Sorry folks. I can't recommend this. Although it does get two stars for having Dustin Hoffman and Susan George, and an extra star for the guy in a bear trap, this film just isn't up to par.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For some films done in the sixties and seventies it is important to remember the era and circumstances of the time. The Graduate must be watched today with the turbulence of the sixties in mind. You have to stand in the shoes of the people of that time. In order to watch Straw Dogs filmed in the early seventies you have to stand in a steaming bucket of crap apparently. I don't know what circumstance or turbulent era Straw Dogs is trying to make a sociological statement about but it surpassed me except to say that the English countryside is full of rapists and completely insane individuals. There is literally not ONE sane English person in this film.The SINGLE only redeeming quality of the film is the SLIGHT performance by Dustin Hoffman and as far as I am concerned he can barely do wrong as he is a great actor even then. Why he took on this role will forever plague me and I hope him as well. Nonetheless his appearance in this film makes it slightly better than the worst trash I have ever seen. I don't know quite where to begin with this film. I don't easily get offended by things and I can take almost anything in film but the disgusting, pointless "rape" scenes in this film were stupid and revolting and should be further banned. The woman from the rape scene and the lead actress in the film Susan George who plays Hoffman's wife turns in one of the worst performances in film history. Her reactions to things are beyond laughable. Not only that but her character is a disturbing, annoying, tramp!! That may sound harsh after saying her character is raped but you have to see the film to understand director Sam Peckinpah created the rape scene for her to actually enjoy it. Yes it disturbs her later on but the actual scene is done in complete and utter distaste. Susan George is a horrible actress which can only partially be blamed on her and the director and writer.The plot of the film is very slow, very confusing and everyone acts certain ways for no reason. When the action finally does break out it's far too late. The violence in the film is like everything else...over the top, gratuitous and I don't believe done for any other reason than to shock which it does and really must have back then. Still the attack at the end is the most pointless event out of the entire movie. I think anyone who is not a film student looking to dissect this film is not going to enjoy it. It's boring and pointless and might be fun arguing but the film was done with absolute distaste and I don't believe Sam Peckinpah made it for any other reason. 0.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moral and ethical issues aside, this film should definitely have remained on the banned films list. Purely just to save people from wasting valuable self mutilation time listening to two hours of mundane and banal dialogue, along the lines of; Amy Sumner: Do you want a cup of tea? David Sumner: HEY I'M WORKING HERE!!!Nothing more exciting than that for about an hour. Until...... major plot twist...... their cat is killed! Lots of "Oh no, how terrible" and "Who would do such a thing?" for twenty minutes. This is then followed by the "controversial" rape of Susan George (Amy Sumner), which, apart from the fact Nyles gets blamed by the villagers for another rape, has no real bearing on any of the story.In my opinion, the only reason this film was banned in the first place, was because the censorship people were so bored that nearly everyone of the reviewers tried to eat their own hands, in frustration at having to sit through such a pile of trash!So Mr Sam (ooh look at me, aren't I controversial) Peckinpah, give me the two hours of my life back and I'll say no more about it.That said, the guy getting caught in the bear trap was quite funny.</fullReview>
