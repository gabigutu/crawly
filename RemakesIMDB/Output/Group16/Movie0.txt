		<shortDescription>It's a shame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More people should know about this wonderful film--reading the book in advance really enhances the experience of it, but one can just enjoy the incredible performances of Bergman and Boyer (not to mention the excellent character roles, particularly Charles Laughton). The use of light/shadow is also extremely well done and atmospheric. It's high time someone re-releases this movie on DVD (Criterion, perhaps), because it's another wonderful example of classic film noir, very well executed. For those not familiar with Remarque's novel, it's a must-read--although I warn you, after you're done you will have an insane urge to try Calvados.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine film of war-time Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pay no attention to high-brow detractors; if you want to see a luminous Ingrid Bergman and a world-weary Charles Boyer at their film noir best, run--do not walk--to your nearest store and buy this film (VHS only, unfortunately).Do not expect sparks to fly between these war-time lovers--Bergman as a kept woman carried along willy-nilly by forces beyond her control, and Boyer as a physician and resistance member on the run in occupied Paris--their encounters are brief and ill-starred, save only for the deep tenderness that occasionally surfaces, especially at the film's end.Casablanca it's not, but it will disappoint no lover of this genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a very fine film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a dark, moody, WW II film that many people today cannot understand. This film is also very close to the book. The photography is as good as The Third Man, and the plot is absorbing. Charles Laughton is mis-cast as the SS (Nazi) agent but other than that the film is terrific. Louis Calhern is impressive as the Russian officer now reduced to be a doorman at a nightclub. This is a serious film made at the time of immense human suffering right after the 2nd WWar and shows the very serious attitudes of the people then. This is a film for people who value well made movies from a bygone age that had great actors and directors. The book is tougher than the movie, it was written by one of the 20th centuries great authors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Continent of Refugees</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lewis Milestone scored his greatest film success when he did the classic adaption of Erich Maria Remarque's novel All Quiet on the Western Front in 1931. It seemed a natural for him to do an adaption of another Remarque book, Flotsam, retitled here as Arch of Triumph. I guess that United Artists didn't want the audience to think the film was about sea refuse.Unfortunately while All Quiet on the Western Front stayed very much on its anti-war message, Milestone opted to make one of those tragic romances that Frank Borzage was more noted for. The problem of all the refugees from all the political turmoil up to THAT time collecting in places like Paris was left very much in the background.Charles Boyer is one of those refugees, a Czech who can't go back to his own country because of Hitler's bloodless takeover. He's a doctor who's been serving in Loyalist Spain and got run out of there. With no passport, he's an illegal alien in France in 1939 and subject to deportation which he is by the way at one point in the film.He meets Ingrid Bergman who's also a refugee of sorts from a series of bad relationships. He saves her from suicide and a relationship develops. In fact when Boyer is deported, she does what she has to do to survive.Louis Calhern may have the best role in the film as Boyer's friend and counselor, an exiled Russian Lieutenant Colonel of the Czar's guard who is a doorman at a swank Russian café. Charles Laughton is in here to as an S.S. officer who Boyer remembers killing his old girl friend back in Spain and who he hunts without mercy. Laughton has one of the smallest roles he ever did in a film and I wish there were more of him here. Laughton is seen briefly at the beginning doing the torture in his best Inspector Javert manner. Later on when Boyer spots him and makes his acquaintance to lure him for the kill, he's an avuncular tourist, but clearly on some kind of mission. He's good in both sides of the same character.It's a real downer of a film, Arch of Triumph. Good thing we know how history turned out because it sure doesn't look good for the good guys when this film ends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arch of Triumph (1948)Wow, what a difficult movie to assess, but not a difficult one to enjoy. On the one hand, it is dripping with mood and anxiety. It is about budding love and broken hearts. There is political intrigue and and incipient Nazi invasion. And it's France, Paris, center of the end of the great century of European art and culture, from the mid 1800s to the mid 1900s. On the other hand, it seems amorphous and vague.Director Lewis Milestone makes this 1938 Paris gloomier than Sherlock Holmes's London--the rain, the darkness, the general lack of hope is part of the great drama lurking behind every scene. Charles Boyer is the main character, a refugee of uncertain origin, and the mysterious woman with both rich and poor friends and an equally uncertain origin is played in usual melodrama by Ingrid Bergman. They have no chemistry, for sure, but that just makes their love affair mysterious as well. In fact, the whole movie is about what we don't know, and can't know by watching. This could be frustrating for some viewers, this lack of intention, and frankly lack of clear plot. But if you can just inhabit this world, enjoying a highly polished mise-en-scene (so polished it shows its Hollywood sound stage roots, at times, though darkly, darkly), if you can just soak it up and not worry, all will be well. It's a beautiful beautiful movie on those terms, photographer Russell Meety is doing that 1940s high contrast photography to perfection. Watch how often he shoots through windows, including the great phone booth shot (repeated ten minutes later) where the accident happens in the background.The story here is based on a 1945 novel by German author Erich Maria Remarque, and Milestone directed the legendary "All Quiet on the Western Front" two decades earlier, also based on a Remarque novel. In both cases, there is an intensity of humanity against the larger military chaos and cruelty that seems so indifferent to them. The book here was actually published in English first as "The Arch of Triumph," and was a huge bestseller before going to a German version.I don't think it's an accident that the pre-war angst here is an echo of "Casablanca," which by now (five years later) was already legendary. Bergman, of course, is carried over (though she had just finished filming "Notorious" for Hitchcock, if you want to follow her career). And Boyer is a better version of Henried (better as an actor). For more colorful secondary characters, you'll find the incomparable Louis Calhern (with a surprisingly effective accent) and Charles Laughton (whose accent is wobbly). This was originally a more gut wrenching four hour film, and I think it might have made more logical sense at that length, but I can see it would have been too long by far. Watch what we have and just take it in for what it is. I enjoyed it on that level very very much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ingrid is Gorgeous; Laughton is a Nazi.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is certainly not Ingrid Bergman's best movie, though her performance as Joan, and Boyer's as Ravic, are terrific. But you will never see a more beautiful Ingrid than in the magnificent black and white =chiaroscuro= of Russell Metty's photography, and Ingrid is very touching as the "lost woman" hinted at but never fully realized in "Casablanca" and "Notorious." Even considering that Bergman was gorgeous on screen for almost forty years, her stunning image in this somewhat confused thriller-soap opera, is worth the price of admission; plus the dialogue is pretty good, and you get to see Charles Laughton as an evil Nazi colonel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could have been a much better movie. Boyer's disenchanted, vengeful refugee doctor is excellent and Bergman's Joan, unable to commit or disengage, could have been a fascinating characterisation. But while individual scenes are very fine, the film, as a whole, is oddly disconnected, suggesting ruthless cutting. The sub-plot involving Laughton's porcine Gestapo bully is perfunctory and we get far too much of Calhern's emigre. Still, the black and white photography is impressive, and I rather went for the doom and gloom!</fullReview>

Atmospheric black and white cinematography by Russell Metty who later made colorful super-productions.The film was restored with longtime but going on tedious,sluggish and dull.The motion picture is regularly directed by Lewis Milestone who directed various classic warlike movies.The flick is based on Erich Maria Remarque novel and was posteriorly rendered for TV(1985)by Waris Hussein with Anthony Hopkins and Lesley Anne Down.The picture will like to Ingrid Bergman and Charles Boyer enthusiastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Potentially great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not sure about this one. There's much to like; the atmosphere, the camera work, the lighting and shadows, the closeups, the acting. But something's missing, perhaps continuity, or the impression that it all somehow fits together. Taken as a series of vignettes this film is very good. Combine the vignettes to tell a subset of the original story and it could be even better. But put it all together and it succumbs under the sheer weight of all the subplots.And yet, despite my criticism, I am pleased to have seen it. As I said there's much to like, especially the acting. Louis Calhern is always a joy and here he lends a nuanced gravitas to his part. Charles Boyer is better than usual playing a tormented refugee torn between love and revenge. Charles Laughton is the pivot about which the story revolves and without him his one dimensional character would have been but a caricature. There's even a memorable cameo by an uncredited William Conrad. His scene is no more than a minute or so but it's not one you're likely to overlook or forget. But the best reason to watch it is of course Ingrid Bergman. Her effortless ability to switch personalities simply draws you in to her performance. Here she plays an insecure wreck, an incredibly seductive, infuriatingly deceitful and mostly terrified woman. Her character's choices are not perhaps entirely honorable but with Bergman who cares...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent and Tragic Postwar Melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we see Ingrid Bergman pulling out all the stops to portray a simple character in a more complex manner, and she succeeds brilliantly. She takes a girl who is merely rather 'loose', weak, and grasping, and turns her into a torrid emotional Rubik Cube puzzle, which no amount of twisting can solve. She gives depths to shallow water undreamed of in the annals of the sea. Matched opposite her is the perfectly behaved but deeply in love Charles Boyer. This was when things were kept cool on the surface, while the fires raged beneath, i.e., it is the 1940s. This film is the Paris refugees' version of 'Close Encounter', and Boyer is just a more romantic Trevor Howard who drinks wine instead of tea. The idea that this film could be remade later with the highly mannered and emotionless Anthony Hopkins in the lead is absurd (Hopkins does 'intensity' but not feelings), and even more so that Ingrid Bergman could be replaced by Lesley Anne Down, of all people. (Best to forget that remake, it was too awful.) Now back to the old pros: Boyer and Bergman, and the sky is alight with hopeless love, and searing tragedy darkens the dawn. Director Lewis Milestone goes at it full throttle, to superb effect. He had directed an earlier novel by the same author, Erich Maria Remarque, eighteen years before ("All Quiet on the Western Front', 1930), so he had a deep feel for the material. What is more, Milestone was a European and a refugee. The underlying theme of the film is the plight of the stateless flotsam and jetsam refugees thrown up by the War. One of Charles Laughton's finest performances is found in this film, as a German Gestapo chief scouting out Paris, whom Boyer, working with the Resistance, befriends in order to kill. The Lionsgate DVD of this film lacks ten minutes, including the scenes where Laughton gets his just deserts, and certain scenes casting aspersions upon the moral standing of Bergman's character. (Let us hope for a restored cut DVD one day.) This is one of the great films of the immediate postwar era, with a cast that takes its emotional story to immense and tragic heights.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reteaming of Boyer and Bergman Doesn't Really Work-Arch of Triumph **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even the re-teaming of Ingrid Bergman and Charles Boyer in this 1948 film doesn't help it very much.At least, unlike the 1985 version, Paris is not that lugubrious. While war is about to break out in September, 1939, Paris is still very much a city of lights, and much is happening in the outdoor cafés.The story is one of an ill-fated affair between a chanteuse and doctor, both refugees from Nazism. Boyer and Bergman are lovers but events and extremely bad timing make for the inevitable tragedy.As always, Charles Laughton is the personification of evil, this time as a Nazi official who loves to visit gay Paris for a variety of reasons, one being to keep check on German citizens who have fled Nazi Germany.The chemistry between Bergman and Boyer is fine, but the story needs to be jazzed up somewhat. It's extremely slow-moving.An interesting performance is given by Louis Calher,as Boris, a friend of Boyer. I loved his line that history doesn't make accommodations.This movie's writing didn't make the necessary accommodations either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can see why this one was a box office loser...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ouch. I noticed on IMDb that this film cost $5,000,000 yet earned a paltry $1,500,000--making it a HUGE loser at the box office. After seeing the film I can think of two main reasons for this. First, it's a drama about French just before and at the beginning of WWII. It's the sort of subject that would have played well DURING WWII--but by 1948, it was not exactly timely. Second, the characters are just a mess--an unlikable and confusing mess. It's a shame, as it should be a lot better considering it stars Charles Boyer and Ingrid Bergman.The film starts in Paris. Boyer plays, inexplicably, an Austrian refugee who is living in the country illegally (why did they do this with his wonderful French accent?!). Apparently, he's fled Austria and is an anti-Nazi. Because he has no passport or visa, he tries to keep a low profile. However, when he meets a young woman who is lost in the rain, he takes her in and cares for her. Now comes the first goofy part of the film. When Boyer finally takes Bergman home, it turns out her lover killed himself in her absence. This is odd--but there's more oddness to come.Soon Boyer and Bergman fall in love and they cavort about Paris and southern France for a bit. However, when he is caught by the police and deported, she is forced to wait and hope he can sneak back in the country. Well, despite her being desperately in love with him, after a couple months, she shacks up with a guy(?). When he returns, he's naturally not happy but she keeps coming to him--saying the other man isn't important and she really loves Boyer! This is not exactly romantic and by now, Boyer has become rather cold towards her. For the next half hour or so, both are bathed in ennui...LOTS.In the meantime, there is a subplot involving Charles Laughton who is an undercover Nazi agent in Paris. Boyer can identify him since Laughton was the man who had previously tortured him--and Boyer is determined to exact revenge.After Boyer gets his revenge, he gets a phone call from Bergman. Apparently she was shot by her lover and the lover also arrives at Boyer's apartment seeking his help--after all, Boyer is a doctor (how fortuitous). He operates on Ingrid but it turns out to be one of those lingering nasty film injuries and she's paralyzed and begs him to put her out of her misery. Whether or not he kills her is uncertain but she is soon dead. And soon the film fizzles towards its confusing conclusion--focusing, for no obvious reason, on the Arc du Triomphe.As you read, you probably can tell I didn't like the movie. It's not just because the plot is too thick with disparate plot elements, but because the two main characters are really annoying. Boyer broods too much but the real problem is Bergman--who plays a really confusing mess of a woman. Her mood is all over the place and her actions often make no sense at all. All in all, a romance with little real romance and a script that seems like it was written by someone who had lost their mind. A huge misfire and a very unsatisfying film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paris, whether real or imagined, has rarely looked so spiritually and atmospherically gloomy on screen as it does in this underrated wartime romantic drama by Lewis Milestone. While the stark chiaroscuro black-and-white cinematography of the venerable Russell Metty certainly plays a hand in painting a bleak portrait of the refugee-laden French capital of the late 1930s, these conditions in the film are also derived from the fact that a good portion of it unfolds during many a rainy night. And it's under such circumstances that our protagonists?the hard-bitten, oft-deported Dr. Ravi&#x107; (Charles Boyer), a victim of the Nazi regime when he was a member of the Austrian underground, and Joan Madou (Ingrid Bergman), a dispirited Italian-born cabaret singer?meet and eventually fall in love. However, this is neither the cutesy nor the heedless kind of love so often seen in lesser films. It is, rather, of the sort that takes place between two complex, multifaceted individuals who are world-weary, are aware of their strengths and weaknesses, and, most importantly in this case, know that they have little to no control over their impending future. Needless to say, both actors, who earlier worked together in George Cukor's Gaslight (1944), come through with strong, authentic performances; Bergman, especially, as her character grows the most and requires her to depict various shades. To its credit, the film's low-key, matter-of-fact approach isn't merely relegated to the love story; its political intelligence is equally sober and attentive. And the same could be said for Milestone's direction?he does not get many opportunities here to showcase his trademark camera movements. Adapted from a novel by German author Erich Maria Remarque, who also provided the source for Milestone's antiwar classic All Quiet on the Western Front (1930), this rich and engrossing film may have been ignored in its day but is bound to emerge triumphant sooner or later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ilegal refugees flock to Paris.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a rainy night in Paris in 1938, Dr. Ravic(Charles Boyer)stops a depressed nightclub singer Joan Madou(Ingrid Bergman)from jumping off a bridge. Ravic is a Czech refugee practicing medicine without a passport and under an assumed name. He doctors those who have fled their countries escaping Hitler. Ivon Haake(Charles Laughton)is a Nazi officer that visits Paris frequently and causes concern for Ravic, who does not want to be recognized in fear of being deported and jailed. Ravic and Joan enter an off and on again romantic relationship; the singer being more needy of the two. As the war begins their affair becomes more complicated and the doctor becomes more obsessed with his thoughts of killing Haake. At times the story line is disjointed and mostly effects Joan and Ravic. Bergman couldn't be more attractive...even in black &amp; white. Her tear filled eyes can break anyone's heart. True beauty is hard to hide. Of course Boyer makes his role look easy; proof of his great acting skills. And Mr. Laughton makes for a realistic villain. Other players include: Louis Calhern, Roman Bohnen, Stephen Bekassy, Ruth Warrick and Michael Romanoff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a great movie, but a beautiful one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a great movie. It's not even a good one. But you'd never know it if you watched it with the sound off. This IS, without any question, one of the most beautifully filmed movies I have ever had the pleasure of watching. You can tell Milestone had experience with silent pictures; he knows how to take advantage of light and shadow in a thousand different ways, all very effective. And, while Ingred Bergman was certainly a very beautiful woman in every picture in which I've seen here, I don't think any film maker made her look more beautiful than she is over and over in this picture. You sit there astounded at how beautiful she looks.But if you turn on the sound, there are problems. The script is downright bad, the construction of the plot poor. While all the acting is fine - with that cast, how could it be otherwise? - there is not much they can do with it. Bergman's character is, finally, very unappealing, and so they take the only "redeeming" way out for her: they give her a death scene. Which should have been the end of the movie.The only good thing one hears by turning up the volume is Louis Gruenberg's score, which is very effective.Though it may have been unintentional, this movie answers the question I have never really bothered to ponder: why did Elsa become involved with Victor Laslo after she stopped hearing from Rick? It's not a pleasant answer, be warned, though it is true the man Bergman's character looks up with here bears none of Laslo's admirable qualities.So, my advice: read the novel, or a plot summary of the movie. Then, when you watch it, turn the sound off. You'll have a great experience. This is a movie not to be missed - but not to be heard, either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>INGRID BERGMAN's immense popularity during the '40s was the only factor to save this film from instant oblivion. It was a huge box-office failure, but nobody blamed Bergman who still looked luminous despite her deadly dull assignment opposite CHARLES BOYER, as the protagonist facing deportment during World War II's Nazi reign.All the ingredients that seemed to make ARCH OF TRIUMPH into a "must see" film were there. First, it's from a novel by Erich Maria Remarque who gave the world ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT. Then the cast included Bergman, Boyer, CHARLES LAUGHTON and LOUIS CALHERN. Then, it was directed by Lewis Milestone and released in time to be considered for Oscar nominations. Alas, there were none and it opened to humiliating reviews.It's a deadly dull affair between Boyer's refugee and Bergman's lady of the night and whatever interest the story might have had is made tedious by the slow funeral pace of the story with its dimly lit exteriors and interiors. It's a thin story without much significance and it's shabby as a piece of entertainment. Not even the great Charles Laughton can save it, his role is so obscure in the scheme of things.Not worth seeing unless you must see every film Ingrid made. She and Boyer were paired much more successfully in GASLIGHT four years earlier.Trivia note: The film's running time was slashed after terrible reviews but restored to 131 minutes for arhival prints.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Remarquable Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst the majority of refugees from the political innovations of 20th century Europe found their way to Britain or North America, a forlorn proportion only made it to France. The Hotel International, Paris, a 2 star establishment, receives those who have squeezed out from under the brutal heels of local dictators. From this flotsam emerges a surgeon from Czechoslovakia, via Spain, and a White Russian , whose employment is summoning taxis for the patrons of a nightclub owned by one of his former junior officers. 'I am your father', the Russian tells the Czech at one point, which explains a part of their relationship. The plot for the rest recalls that of Puccini's opera La Boheme, set in Paris a hundred years before the events depicted here. Ingrid Bergman appears mostly in horizontal positions or in shadow, as if the director was consciously trying to reduce the impact of a performance that threatens to overwhelm. Charles Boyer strains to give the predicament of his character some significance. The slim pickings of the refugees might seem to imbue their lives with conventional pathos, but Remarque's vision is bleaker, suggesting the situation is a colossal waste of human energy, talent and life itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a surprise that this film was based on a popular novel, as it seems to be written daily just before the shoot. Bergman looks at times chubby, and Boyer seems forced at being attracted to her. The jack-in-the-box appearances of the Nazi Laughton never seem to influence the movie's direction and 2/3s through the movie my mind was silently screaming for something to happen that was interesting. Two actors had been handed scripts and sent to the set. The director and camera man decided that the whole film should have unvarying dark shadows. Boyer, whose deep tone delivery is a pleasure, seem to be afraid to crack his makeup, as his facial expression, kind of a Clint Eastwood stare, never changed. The Victorian standards of the time made it difficult to determine if these fully clothed people had gone any farther than the steamy though mechanical kissing closeups. Big smooch and then a discreet discussion of their 'relationship'. Boring. This comment site is too regulated by Dumkovs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A novel by Remarque. A cast that looks great on paper. A left-wing refugee struggling to remain in Paris between the wars. A Gestapo officer undercover.It's a pity there's no synergy here. The bits and pieces never coalesce.Stories about left-wing refugees in France don't have to be this dull. Read Arthur Koestler's memoir "Scum of the Earth" (if you can find it). Or his chilling "Dialogue With Death" (ditto).To me, the only interest in this film lies in some of the incidental details.The leads spend a lot of time drinking calvados, the Norman apple brandy. I welcome any prompting to have a nip of calvados myself. It certainly made this film appear to pass more quickly. But, according to the film, it's only sold in cheap, low-class saloons. Vive le tabac parisien! That's what I say. References to intoxicating liquors do abound here; that would seem to be a preoccupation of the scenarists.I enjoy films set in France because it can be amusing waiting for the inevitable full-size alcohol ad to pop up on a wall in the background. I wasn't disappointed. This time it was for Byrrh, a very unusual choice. This film would rate a 10 if only we were judging it on the refinement of its booze murals.The film's indifferent score is by Louis Gruenberg. Gruenberg is best known -- if you can call it that -- for his opera "The Emperor Jones", based on the O'Neill play. It premi?red at roughly the same time as the film version starring Paul Robeson. The opera survives today in a recording or two by Lawrence Tibbett. It should surface again soon though; they're running out of potentially marketable operas to revive.Opera seems an appropriate subject to mention here since Charles Boyer's character operates under his "Czech" aliases. Two of them are "Wozzeck" and "Gunther", both prominent roles in German opera. Is that just coincidence?Name-dropping just seems to be part of this film. Notice that they call up "Himmelstoss" on the phone. Himmelstoss happens to be one of the main characters in Remarque's earlier "All Quiet on the Western Front".Well, the in-jokes are all in place; guess there wasn't time to develop any drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching and nice film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is based on a novel by Erich Maria Remarque. It's not the only film based on his books, and this one is just as rough but lovely as the others. It is a story , in Paris in World War II, about refugees and tortured people, a very present-day topic, and not only in remote countries: torture is usual also in some parts of Europe. But the film is much more than this: it's a passionate and moving story about love, fidelity, despair... and poverty. What would you do if the one you love were deported, you wouldn't know whether he or she would come back, you had not even money enough to eat, and you had another person whom you wouldn't love, but who would be prepared to pay all the bills?I give it 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ingrid is Beautiful, as Usual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I didn't adore Ingrid so much I wouldn't bother giving my opinion of this dreary film. First of all, Charles Boyer was absolutely terrible in this. Ingrid's beauty and superb acting carried the story. Because of her I kept watching it, hoping something good would come out of it. I won't say what the ending was, but it was stupid. Louis Calhern's acting (he played with Ingrid in Notorious, you remember), also was of the best. And Charles Laughton who had a small role. Boyer was great with Ingrid in Gaslight, but certainly not in this role. I can honestly say that no matter what Ingrid Bergman stars in, she always makes the film better than what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tolerable!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>None of the best Bergman-movies but still a good one ...The story itself is betimes a bit low but the actors keep it just by their presence tolerable. La Bergman, starring the first totally intimidated Joan Madou but later turning into an open lovely woman till the end where one sometimes can't stand her part how she keeps on putting Boyer off, beautiful as ever and Boyer, starring the lonely and in heart-pain captured German refugee Ravic who works as illegal surgeon in Paris and by the love of Joan (re)turning into a warm human-being but in the end in heart-pain again because of Joan (what a woman!!), in the 2nd movie of the Bergman/Boyer-couple once friendly to his colleague!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A notorious loser of a film involving some very distinguished talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How could a Hollywood dream teaming like Ingrid Bergman, Charles Boyer and Charles Laughton under Lewis Milestone's direction and screenwriting come true and result in a film like this? It obviously tries to copy Bergman's earlier box office smash "Casablanca" judging by its similar plot but this film's levels of success (if any, it was a huge box office flop) do not even come remotely close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply insufferable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This stuffy melodrama is quite easily the worst film starring Ingrid Bergman that I've seen. Even her luminous screen presence can't save this insufferably slow and meandering movie that's nearly impossible to sit through without fast-forwarding a lot of it.Only for die-hard Bergman fans; others are very likely to fall asleep. I suggest you to watch "For Whom the Bell Tolls" instead.</fullReview>
