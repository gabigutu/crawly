		<shortDescription>Good Film, Great Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before you let the advertising fool you, understand that "Willard" isn't exactly your normal horror flick. I know that the marketing people tried to put all the scary bits into the trailer and such, but I urge you to reconsider your views on it.The movie itself is more of an in-depth character study. It follows the events that lead one man into the pits of insanity, taking you along for the ride. Forget "Psycho," (Which was an awesome film in its own right) though the movie does have Norman Bates/Hitchcock elements. We're taken from lonely, shy, and sad, to hollering, glaring, weeping, and finally, silent. Only one man was tailor-made for this role...and that man was Mr. Glover.Through every blink, every wide-eyed stare, the audience is drawn into the character. We believe in his connection with the rats, and marvel at his ability to train them. And when he gets even with Mr. Martin, we celebrate.And I loved the undoubted sexual frustration that Willard is feeling. It's more apparent in one of the deleted scenes on the DVD. But the writer didn't succumb to this frustration; he let it build.All of this combines to form one of the greatest character movies I have ever seen, and probably will ever see. I must say that this is one movie I will not soon forget...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Devilsihly dark remake is a fresh breath of air...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Crispin Glover gives a splendidly dark and evil performance in "Willard," a performance that creeps you out more than any idea of killer rats ever will. The movie feels like a Tim Burton Lite, and a few times throughout the film I came close to imagining how Tim Burton would have directed the film. He probably would have gotten Johnny Depp for Willard, though, and I'm not sure if Depp would have been able to pull it off as well as Glover, who has always been a very strange character, even back when he played the shy and quirky George McFly in "Back to the Future."If Crispin was odd in "Back to the Future," then he's part of the Manson family here. It seems to be an almost tailor-made role, one fit just for him. His character, Willard, is a mix between Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates and Adam Sandler's Barry Anderson from "Punch-Drunk Love." I half-expected to see Willard's mother jump out in front of the screen at some point in the film, only for "her" to be Willard. Anyone familiar with the seventies should remember "Willard," and perhaps even its sequel, "Ben." I didn't know quite what to expect walking into "Willard," as I had never seen the original. It is a very dark and creepy movie, perhaps not for everyone, but I enjoyed it. It's quirky. It's creepy. It's dark and brooding. And it has a sly sinister side to it. When Willard retreats to his basement every night to train a gang of rats to carry out his evil deeds it's not really scary but rather strange in execution. Given another director this could have been another summer horror flick like "Jeepers Creepers 2," but it turned out to be a bit more than a scary movie - it's more of a freaky movie.Willard (Glover) is a grown man who lives in a large, creepy home with his bitter old mother. He cares for her and goes to work to help support her, where he works for "Mr. Martin," a gruff old guy who claims that the reason he drives a Mercedes is for the company's benefit. He relentlessly picks on Willard, who bites his tongue in return and counts to ten.Extremely lonely, Willard retreats into his mother's basement one night to try to get rid of some rodent infestation. Once there, he finds that he has caught a smart little white rat in one of his traps, which he frees from the sticky paper and names Socrates (because the rat is smart). Soon he finds that Socrates can understand him, as do all the other rats. He also realizes that the rats will do whatever he wants, whether it be attacking Martin's Mercedes or eating Martin to death. And so he uses them at his psychopathic will; that is, except for a very large rat named Ben, who is about the size of a small dog. Ben is smart, and tries to win Willard's attention, but Willard ignores Ben (one can understand why), and pays all the attention to Socrates. Ben doesn't like this, and so he starts commanding the gang of rats against Willard. The film ends in a strange showdown between rats and man, to say the least. I used to have a little white rat just like Socrates, which I named Socrates, and I used to have another big, black rat, which I named Ben. (Yes, I named them after the rats from the old film.) Rats are kind little creatures but you get the idea that they are a very smart species, always scheming. Watching the "real" Ben from "Willard" is funny, because as he sits there scheming it is in all truth very honest - rats are smarter than they seem.Willard seems to have a psychic connection between the rats. It's like the story of the dog that followed his master all the way across the Atlantic ocean, running up to him in the middle of a WWII battlefield. Some experts say that animals have boundaries with their masters that they can somehow feel, relate to or are attached to psychically. By charming Socrates, it seems that Willard opened up a sort of psychic connection between the rats, and the way he carries them around on his shoulder, and says to Socrates, "You are the only friend I've ever had," is strangely disturbing.I wasn't sure what to expect going into "Willard," and I'm still not sure if the film used up all the potential it had. They could have spent more time focusing on Willard's development into a psychopath, more time on what the rats did, more time showing the audience that Willard is the bad guy. It seems that they go wishy-washy - are we supposed to root for Willard or not? I don't really know, but I enjoyed the movie. It's not an incredible achievment in any regard, and I left feeling a little empty but I'm glad I saw it.3.5/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Macabre fairy tale. Very atmospheric!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Glen Morgan's Willard isn't your ordinary mainstream remake! Unlike the bombastic and computerized money-making films like ?oh, I don't know Texas Chainsaw Massacre, 13 Ghosts and Dawn of the Dead who're merely loud updates of classic horrific tales. Willard is a modest and respectful production that lays the stress on atmosphere and scenery instead of gory effects and good-looking young flesh. Willard is the tale of an extremely introvert middle-aged man (lives with his needy mother, no girlfriend, stuck in a hopeless job) who discover his ability to control and command little rodents?rats in particular. By communicating with these rats, he finally discovers what friendship feels like and it also gives him the opportunity to satisfy his deepest feelings of anger and vengeance towards his boss ? Frank Martin. But the mob of rats slowly turns against Willard as he doesn't treat them alike. Thanks to the depressing scenery (Willard's old house, the morbid factory) and the under-exposure at times, Willard often looks like a 40's chiller! There's a good and constant variation of tension and sadistic humor, with the cat-chase as the absolute highlight to state this. Crispin Glover ? the man with the most incomprehensible cult following in the film industry ? is brilliantly cast as Willard. His goofy ? yet spooky ? charisma fits his character really well. R. Lee Ermey receives the change to be his old boisterous self again as the dreary factory-owner who's out to destroy Willard life. To conclude the cast, Laura Harding is very charming as the understanding and helpful Cathryn. This film may not show as many bloodshed and eccentric slaughtering as the nowadays public demands, but it surely made an impression on me. Willard is a very atmospheric and often frightening horror storytelling with some adorable fairy-tale aspects and playfully imaginative aspects. Highly recommended. I saw this film at a during a festival-night?after a series of gory slashers. The over-enthusiast public didn't appreciate it that much but I trust in the fact that Willard will build up a solid cult reputation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Weird Tale About Loneliness, Friendship, Greed and Revenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Willard Stiles (Crispin Glover) is a lonely and deranged man living in an old mansion with his sick mother Henrietta Stiles (Jackie Burroughs). His father committed suicide after losing his own company to his former partner and friend Frank Martin (R. Lee Ermey). Due to a clause in the selling contract, Willard can not be fired from his job while his mother is alive. However, Frank abuses of Willard, humiliating and spending a horrible treatment with him in front of his colleagues. The basement of Willard's house is infested of rats and mice, and Willard capture a beautiful white mouse in a trap. Willard rescues the mouse, calls him Socrates and becomes his friend. Socrates is a leader and the other rats obey him, except the huge Ben. The animals are trained by Willard, who uses them for his revenge. This weird tale about loneliness, friendship, greed and revenge has the same style of most Tim Burton's movies. It is a black comedy very dark, quite gothic, having weird characters, but great performances and good effects. Although dealing with a nasty theme (rats and mice), it is not a disgusting film. It is not recommended for all audiences, but I liked it a lot. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): `A Vingança de Willard' (`The Revenge of Willard')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange and different, but not particularly scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe self-parody isn't such a bad word in the case of Willard. While I will state that the film was funny and interesting to watch, it wasn't nearly as twisted or as scary as it could have been. But then again, it's so damn tough to scare the jaded masses of critics and movie goers anyway. However, I did find this film wildly entertaining, especially the likes of Glenn Morgan and James Wong helming the project, two guys who helped put together The X-Files and Space: Above and Beyond (a truly underrated show). The only downside to this film was the editing. It was sometimes dull, and often did little to help the plot move in a smooth fashion. However, the random close-ups of the rat/wombat "Big Ben" were hillarious, making it look like the rat would actually start talking. Also, I give a big kudos to R. Lee Ermey, who went back to his old Full Metal Jacket days, making him a scary and evil bad guy to focus on. Oh, and Crispin Glover plays the loser role perfectly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Willard: 8/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the least successful movies of the year, when it should have been one of the most, is Willard, the remake of the Bruce Davison version. It has everything going for it, and it was really the dismal marketing campaign that brought it to its early demise. If more people had given it a chance, then hopefully it would have been more successful and more people would have been able to see this masterwork. That's what Willard is, it's a masterpiece, at least of the movies of the last ten years or so. No movies have been up to par in so many different levels.Crispin Glover puts in the best acting performance of the year, and possibly one of the best of all time is the title character. He has a dead-end job at his late father's business, now run by his father's partner, Frank Martin (R. Lee Ermey), who just keeps him on until Willard's mother (Jackie Burroughs) dies. When his mother makes him go look for rats, Willard finds one, keeps it, and names it Socrates. He discovers more, and they do whatever Socrates tells him. However, a huge rat named Ben wants control, and fights with Socrates for power, while Willard uses the rats for his own sociopathic will.As I said earlier, Willard has everything going for it. I'll go one at a time. The directing, by X-Files alum Glen Morgan (also written by him and co-produced with James Wong) was perfect. He has an obvious style (and probably studied Hitchcock in college), and creates a sense of realism in this implausible movie. Also, Morgan's screenplay has some of the best humor to come out of a movie this year, especially from Ermey and Burroughs. I won't spoil them, although they're still funny on repeat viewings.The acting, especially by Glover, who isn't a forerunner in big Hollywood names, is spectacular. Glover portrayed a young, aimless man so well. No one can scream like this man can. He's not afraid to let go and let his emotions run him over. He must have some deep repressed memories. Ermey is outstanding, but, then again, when is he not? He just plays an evil character, and that's what he's great at. Laura Elena Harring (Mulholland Drive) does what she can with her very small role. I noticed she tried to repress an accent, but I couldn't tell from where. Sounded Spanish, but I digress. Burroughs is great, although more of her (not really looking at her, though?she's hideous) would have been great.Morgan takes what could have been disastrous and turned it around to become a truly creepy film. Willard shows the side of every person who wants to do something evil, but can't find the will to do it. That's where Willard succeeds, you end up rooting for someone you normally wouldn't because he's doing something that you desperately want to do. Willard is a modern masterpiece, one that will thankfully find a huge audience on DVD.My rating: 8/10Rated PG-13 for terror/violence, some sexual content and language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, it took me a long time, but better late than never. So, the main reason why most people didn't liked it, because it was not a horror film. So what? If you can understand that it's not a horror, then why don't you watch it wherever you think it is? "Willard" is an absolutely beautiful movie. I couldn't believe how atmospheric it was. I didn't expected much from the movie, esp. I was worried about CGI rats, but I wanted to see it for Crispin Glover. And the moment I've heard the music score I knew it is going to be something special. I don't think that it is weird movie at any point. It was beautiful movie. This is probably the word that describes it best. It may sound stupid, but I know that I have a good taste in movies. *coughs* That's why I can say that "Willard" is definitely one of the best recent movies and I can tell that it is not just personal opinion, it is one of the best movies. If it is a bad movie, then what do you consider a good movie?.. OK, it worked just because of Crispin Glover. He glued everything together. Without him it would be stupid and pointless. But he makes the concept believable. It should of get a few Oscar nomination, that's for sure, but no one surprised that it didn't. The music score was really outstanding, gave it a real feeling, kudos to composer. Definitely deserves an Oscar nom. The production design as well. Superb atmosphere. CGI was great! It was a real surprise and delight to see that CGI is great. Glen Morgan, he did such a great job. He had some small mistakes, but he is way much more superior than today's directors. It still hard to say about his style, because there is a lot of Hitchcock in him, but he did a great job in "Willard" without doubt. Kudos! Now, the acting. What can I say about Crispin Glover? He is a genius! An absolutely amazing genius! The Academy is just an ass, but it is not surprise. But he definitely deserves an Oscar, he owns it, it is THE best performance of 2003! He scared me to death, in good way. He has so much emotion in him, I couldn't believe how amazing his performance is! I have no right words to give him a credit. I'm just speechless? R. Lee Ermey, I like him a lot. He is one of my favorites too. Such a fun man. Kudos to you, R. Lee Ermey! Jackie Barroughs?creepy! In a good way, she did a great job, she really is! I mean, without her scary mother the movie wouldn't be the same! Laura Harring, I like her too, she was great in "Mullholand Drive". I know some people say that she was completely wasted and they right, but she still was a nice touch. I mean, it is always nice to look at her, she has that good quality about her. I don't know, but maybe she regret that she wasted her time here, but if I could I would say to her, that I think it's better to be a part of this labor of love, than some crappy Hollywood s***. If you watch deleted scenes on DVD it doesn't seem like she is wasted at all. And, the end. I like the new ending better, because it gives you to think about more, the old ending, IMHO, is quite pointless. So, to end the review. It is a masterpiece on its own right. It is an absolutely beautiful movie. So sensitive, so atmospheric, so emotional. My eyes were just glued to the screen. I know that Glen Morgan feels bad about the movie's failure, but he shouldn't, it was not his fault! It IS a great movie! When it ended I hoped that the teenagers will love it (I'm a teenager, myself), because the studio target at them, I hoped that this beautiful movie will be an exception, when they gonna love it for not being a usual stupid movies. But when they didn't, I just realized that some people will always be stupid no matter what. Well, their loss. It is one of my favorites. It is a deep, emotional movie. I'm sure Crispin Glover would be happy to know that "Willard" makes people think. It really is, esp. about human condition. I thought a lot about this movie and I'm not the only one. I recommend it highly. Definitely 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie centers about Crispin Glover a quirky and lone man about thirty years old . He lives with her ill mother and amount of mouses into his home . He has got as enemy to the office chief . Rats will help him to revenge .The film will have to flee whom don't like the rats because they appear in everyone shots , close-ups , foreground and background of the flick . There are thousand rats and they have been made by animatronics and computer generator specials effects(FX).Acting by Crispin Glover is excellent , interpreting to Willard as a twisted mind is fantastic , likeness to Norman Bates/Anthony Perkins of Psychosis . R. Lee Ermey as the evil and villain chief is perfect such as his acting in ¨Full metal jacket¨ , Laura Elena Harring (Mulholland drive) is cute .Direction by Glen Morgan is nicely made , cinematography by Robert MacLachlan is first-rate and Shirley Walker's musical score is gorgeous.It's a remake to another 1971 film featured by Bruce Davison who only appears in photography as Willard's father into this 2003 film.Rating 6/10 , average .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crispin Glover shows his talents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Culkin should have taken the role that this movie offered him. For an actor who is trying to prove something to the industry in Hollywood, this movie is an excellent example. Crispin Glover has had a reputation in the film industry as a strong, yet weird actor. Many of the roles that he has received makes Crispin look crazy if not odd. Here, Crispin shows his serious and comic side. The movie alone holds up as a gritty thriller. A horror movie none-the-less, Willard is an interesting film that we don't see too often. A well made movie with decent production value, the cast adds to its greatness. Much like River's Edge, the audience is left wondering where Crispin Glover came from. No longer a young actor, Crispin has worked his way up to become a veteran performer and a good actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genre expectations tainted most viewers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People who hated this movie went to see it with the preconceived notion that rats would be doing a lot bloodier leg work for Willard. What they got was a movie wherein Crispin Glover kisses his best rattie friend and slowly ambles toward insanity.Willard has flaws, and plenty of them, but they rarely detract from what is, at heart, a psychological parable and subtle love story. Crispin Glover's performance is one of his most genuinely human and believable, evoking ugly emotions rarely seen in Hollywood, while still retaining a manic kind of dignity.You can hardly fault New Line for marketing Willard as a horror flick, since that is what would inevitably sell better. But Willard is really more of a movie for people who genuinely like rats, not those who fear them. It's a movie for people who find greater horror in failure and abuse and solitude than buckets of blood and gore. Willard is the kind of movie that aims to make you uncomfortable, but not truly horrified. It uses few of the common elements of the horror movie, including graphic violence, deformity, fear of the unknown, and sudden, unexpected movement or loud noises to propel you from your seat. It is slow moving and subtle, and often uses crude humor to detract from the more creepy moments. It shows itself as a juvenile in those moments, a child who has put on his father's suit and is masquerading as a serious adult. It is much like the character of Willard, in that sense, and the coincidence is almost admirable.The movie is unquestionably more subtle, evocative, and well-crafted than its predecessor; it is also more faithful to the original novel, Ratman's Notebooks, than the version starring Bruce Davison. It's a dubious honor, some might say.Willard deserves no prizes, but it is well-made to be what it is... not a horror movie, nor a drama, nor a thriller. It's an intimate little movie about a boy and his rat, and it is all the better for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glover at the height of his powers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gloriously weird, Crispin Glover's performance seems to boil out of the rage-fueled emotionalism of an era before Botox: think Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster, blended with the latter-day fragility and introspection of Sean Penn. This role gives him the room to show off some astonishing gifts. Glover is the best but far from the only reason to recommend this remake, superior in most ways to the 70s original. (There's some homage along the way, including a tongue-in-cheek set piece done to Michael Jackson's famous warble, "Ben". How time has made that hymn to interspecies love sound creepy!) Writer-director Glen Morgan has crafted a chewy little parable about capitalism, and his sardonic depiction of the real rat race, with a reliably savage Lee Ermey flogging his office employees behind a motivational sign reading "Prudent Aggression," gives the film more than the usual B horror subtext. The production design is sweet, too.A terribly nice 100 minutes, and one of the best B horrors since Reanimator.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No one wants a friend like Ben (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben is a rat. A smart rat, but a rat nonetheless. Socrates is also a rat; he's as smart as Ben but more lovable. Willard, though, is a pathetic loser. A friendless nobody who's under the thumb of his skeletal mother.What's clear from the beginning of Willard is that the two rats who vie for the affection of their master are the two sides of his tortured personality. Socrates, white and beautiful, is his good side, the side that is tender and loving and sweet. Ben, though, dark and brooding and ugly, is his bad side, the side that is angry and vengeful and that hates the world. So the rat who outlasts the other is the one that will take possession of this greasy weirdo's soul.One of the most eyebrow-raising moments in the film is when Willard tells Socrates that he hates everyone in the world except him and that they should go to bed. Go to bed? Yes, he says it tenderly. He says it seductively. He says it like they're going to, well, make love. Er. Um. Right.However, a tender scene turns bad when the dastardly Ben, who has previously been told that he's not allowed to leave the cellar, crawls into the bed perhaps seeking a ménage a trois. He wants part of the action, the little perv. But Willard isn't having it. He wants no part of Ben. His heart belongs to Socrates.But what could have screwed Willard up so badly that he has to sleep with rodents in order to feel some sort of contentment? Well, I guess a crazy mother would do that to you. Especially one that wants to rename you Clark because Willard is a cissy name and one that wants to check your poo when you tell her you're having bowel issues. How is a young man meant to get a girl when she's walking around? No wonder Willard chooses rats.But there's also Willard's boss. The second you see him and find out that he's played by Lee Ermey you know he's going to be a colossal bastard. And he lives up to expectations. He shouts at Willard, he bullies him, he takes his wages and basically does anything he can to make his life a living hell. Yet another reason to seek refuge in the tickly caress of a rat's vivacious whiskers.Another eyebrow-raising moment is when Willard is training his rat army. He keeps on repeating the phrase 'tear it'. And as he says it, he becomes more and more impassioned. It's like he's getting aroused. Maybe he's thinking about tearing more than just paper. But I do love some of the details in the rat training sequence. I mean, there's even a little rat obstacle course. How sweet. But it's also in this sequence that we first meet Ben. But he doesn't really take part in the training because a) he's a fat bastard and b) he's a bit above himself. In fact, he's a bit nasty is Ben. He's always lurking in the corner like a right creepy bastard. Plus he has a habit of always turning up no matter how hard you try and get rid of him. Trying to get rid of Ben is like trying to escape a fart in a crowded lift.Then there's the fact that Ben's borderline psychotic. In one of the film's best scenes, a cat is given to Willard and its left alone in his creepy house with all of his rats. Under Ben's command, the rats pursue the feline. And then after finding higher ground, and apparently escaping the filthy pests, Ben attacks and the cat is knocked to the ground and consumed by Ben's underlings. Oh, and to make it even better, the scene is scored to the Jackson 5's song 'Ben' from the awesomely titled sequel to the original Willard, Ben. The juxtaposition of violence with a tender love song dedicated to vermin is exquisite.But although all of this violence is committed by Ben in order to get Willard to love him, his feelings are never returned. Indeed, late in the film, Willard even shouts that he hates Ben and that he loves Socrates. And this is after Willard tries to abandon Ben. He gets the large rat to kill his boss and then says goodbye to him. He's trying to escape the darkness and reclaim the light. But it's too late. He's become what he loathes. He's become Ben.And just compare Ben to Socrates. There's a scene where Willard is going through his deceased father's possessions (in a nice little nod to the original film, Willard's dead father has the image of Bruce Davison, the actor who originally played Willard). He takes a knife and is contemplating killing himself. But then Socrates stops him. Meanwhile Ben watches from above. He wouldn't stop Willard, the bastard.But Crispin Glover is wonderfully cast in the film. He's the consummate weirdo and fits the part exceptionally well. And his commitment to the role is impressive. There's an amusing scene where he's at his mother's funeral and he shows her his only friend, the rat Socrates. The rat climbs over mum's face and then Glover begins bawling, a massive line of snot dangling from his nose. And then later on in the scene, when he finds out he's in debt and may lose his house, he just starts ranting and screaming. It's kind of reminiscent of his appearance on Letterman. And he also has a nice singing voice. 'Ben' isn't quite 'Clowny Clown Clown', but it provides an ironic counterpoint to Willard's mistaken assertion that his association with Ben is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. No, it's the beginning of your demise. Ben will be the end of you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If ever Crispin Glover needed a decent role then this was tailor made for him. After refusing to work on BTTF 3 and a terrible performance in Charlies Angels, i got the feeling that he thought too high and mighty of himself. But at last a role that he plays superbly as the victim of constant harassment at work who seeks revenge by taming and using the rats in his basement that he was supposed to get rid of. You can't help but feel sympathy for him ( I know I would like to do that to my Boss!!).Altogether a very well made film that will give you the creeps, it falls into the watch once only category.Final Verdict 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Willard" is a really good movie. I liked it a lot and Crispin Glover is a good actor, although this is the only film I have ever seen him in. This was a disturbing movie and not scary. Maybe a little disgusting in some parts, but definitely not a horror. As almost everyone who loved this movie has said, Crispin Glover WAS Willard. I thought he played him to perfection. He was shy, sad, sweet, quiet, angry, manic, and crazy all in one! He was a mixture of all those things! I loved the way Crispin portrayed him. Whenever he was p*ssed off all he did was clench his teeth, breath hard, and his eyes would grow to the size of quarters. I liked how he wasn't violent and homicidal until he befriended those rats and he thought about all those people who wronged him. Especially his boss. What an ass! He deserved it. Willard was a sweet guy. He really was. I thought the scene when the boss killed Socrates was sad. And I don't usually find it sad when rats are killed. But Socrates was Willard's only friend! Besides Kat, of course, but I think Willard liked Socrates more than her. :) Anyways. Crispin Glover played Willard flawlessly. A great actor. As for the rats, they didn't scare me. They were disgusting and ravenous, but not very frightening. Ben the evil rat was creepy, though. I think the only thing that would have made the rats scary is if they had glowing red eyes and long fang-like teeth. Now that would be frightening. But I don't think Willard would have wanted to hang out with them if they looked like that. But the rats were OK but not scary. Well, overall I thoroughly enjoyed this film and my favorite thing about it was Crispin's performance. I loved watching him. He was creepy. Anyways. Thanks for reading my review!P.S. As for the cat scene, TOTALLY unnecessary. Very sad and disturbing, especially if you're a cat lover, like I am. I had to give my cat away last week because she had fleas and watching that scene made me think of her. And I cried! I CRIED! And I think the music was what made it an even sadder scene. That's the only thing I didn't like about this movie. Very cruel and out of place. Good movie, though!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crispin Glover at his creepiest! *May Contain Spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when I thought that Crispin Glover could be no creepier, I watch "Willard." Now, bear in mind that I just saw "Willard" even though it has been out since 2003. I just could not force myself to watch a movie that I knew would scare the daylights out of me. Now I am a person who loves gory movies, the gorier the better and the more sadistic they are the better; but psychological thrillers, I simply can not stand to watch, and I knew that was what "Willard" would be. I was not disappointed.This movie greatly disturbed me and will continue to. I'm not sure if it was because of Glover's dark, sinister and terrifying portrayal of a man who lives with his old and quite unhinged mother (played as only Jackie Burroughs could play her) or simply the "feel" of the movie. I wasn't thrilled about R. Lee Ermey's part in this movie, but honestly can't tell you if anyone else could have done better. I am a big fan of R. Lee Ermey's and I'm not sure if this could be considered one of his better movies, but Crispin Glover on the other hand...I can hardly get the words out.It is widely known that Crispin Glover is a colorful if not very strange person in real life, but his portrayal of the slowly-descending-into- madness, Willard is by far, one of the most convincing portrayals by an actor that I have ever seen in a movie. One had to wonder if a part of Glover himself did not go into this movie...that if maybe his portrayal of "Willard" is simply a facet of his own personality that he keeps hidden in Hollywood, yet drew it out to play this chilling role.His interaction with the rats in his home, especially Socrates and the way he trains them all like miniature dogs is chilling enough, but couple that with his hardened stare and chiseled face and you have the makings of a character that makes Norman Bates look like The Reverend Billy Graham.It is my personal opinion that Crispin Glover did not receive the acclaim he so rightly deserved for his portrayal of "Willard" and if *this* is what we can expect in the way of horrifying from the likes of this strange actor, then I shudder to think at what else he could pull out of that side of himself.I give this movie a 6 out of a 10, for while creepy, it could have been so much more. Glover can't have been expected to carry the entire movie and yet he nearly did. He was strong enough to. Crispin Glover was horrifying and this movie still makes me cringe when I think about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Destined to be a cult classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Willard is a movie that doesn't really fall into a specific category. Don't expect a traditional horror, but don't expect a B horror comedy either. If anything, it's a very morbid drama. There are some good characters in it that you end up caring for. Crispin Glover does a perfect job as Willard, it's his best performance yet, and R. Lee Eremey is great in the over-the-top role of Willard's boss. But what I found most surprising is how much you actually end up caring for the rats. The 2 lead rats even seem to have personalities. There are some creepy scenes but nothing that will keep you up at night. It's a fairly predictable movie- you know from his very first scene that Willard's boss is going to get it. But that doesn't matter, the movie's entertaining and interesting, and that's enough. The end leaves a door open for a sequel, and I say bring it on. I'd like to see another Willard.This is destined to be a cult classic. A movie about a guy and a bunch of rats isn't likely to become a world-wide hit, but I think this will be more popular on video. It's good late night movie.My rating: 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not a horror movie, but a good black comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I skimmed through the reviews for this film and noticed that some were complaining about how Willard wasn't scary. Just coming from the film, I have to say; it's not supposed to be scary.Black comedy is the category to put this movie in. The whole film is filled with sarcasm, thought the dialogue, the situations (The cat scene was hilarious, and even the cinematography (iconology with the computer mouse, such a nice touch).The film was beautifully shot and the rats were excellent actors. I believe Ebert said, "They were too predictable" or something of the sort. Jeeze man, of course they were! Through the cinematography, pacing, and talent of those fuzzy little creatures, it's almost as if you can understand what they are thinking... but that's just a film technique used to have that effect on the viewer.On to Crispen Glover. Hey, he can play a broad range of weirdo's and I give him my all respect for doing so. His performance was great. He went through a broad range emotions, portraying them mostly to rats, which in my opinion, is a great feat.Willard may be a bit slow, but the pacing of the film actually portrays the character. The pace will coincide with Willard as he goes through the emotions of loneliness, sadness, anger, and eventually leading to insanity.Hey, so I enjoyed Willard. It was kinda like a Euro Artsy flick. You come out of the theatre wondering what the hell you just watched, then start picking out all the really neat and interesting things about it, then laugh again about the cat scene. A Good black comedy. I've never seen the original Willard, but this was a great remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WILLARD is one of the best remakes of a horror film I have ever seen. It is a haunting, suspenseful, and unforgettable roller coaster ride of a horror show. It is a film that left me shocked, horrified, and grateful that I had the opportunity to see such a beautiful work of art. It is a wonderfully acted, directed, written, and edited film. This film makes me want to direct a horror film. It is the story of a young man named Willard who has a terrible life. He must care for his very sick mother, his boss hates him and doesn't hesitate to humiliate him everyday at work, and his basement has a serious rat infestation. Willard befriends the rats and is able to command them to do his bidding. One of the rats, Ben, begins to feel resentment toward Willard due to his bullying and soon begins a sort of ratlike revolt. There were scenes in this film that scared the hell out of me. There's one scene involving a cat that I had to cover my eyes at. Crispin Glover plays Willard with so much personality and charisma, and yet I was able to forget that he was Crispin Glover due to his completely pitiful and grim situation and how quickly things go bad for him. There were some very clever little homages to the original. The portrait of the actor on the wall and the use of the song 'Ben' by Michael Jackson and the Jackson 5 were on display in a way that didn't call so much attention to itself to remind you that it's a remake, but rather they were neat little trinkets put in the film for those who are fans. The house that Willard occupies looks like the Bates Motel. The scene where he attempts to kill himself had me in tears. I haven't even mentioned Socrates yet! Oh man. This film is funny as hell too. The scene where Willard goes to his bosses garage has hilarious. The film manages to stay just on that right balance of horror and comedy and is able to switch in a way that does catch the viewer off guard, like the scene with the dog barking at Willard while he's walking home. Willard's mother was creepy as hell. Willard's boss, played by R Lee Ermney, was ridiculously cruel but still incredibly believable to me. The whole film was really creepy and it ends on a very creepy note. The film's goal was obviously to make the audience sympathize with Willard. I think it pulled this off perfectly. I felt remarkably bad for him and when he starts going off the deep end and gets crazy I wasn't surprised and felt even worse because I wanted things to turn out better. This film was an emotional experience for me and I applaud Crispin Glover and director Glen Morgan for pulling off such a wonderful film.PROS: -Scary atmosphere -Top notch performance by Crispin Glover -A chilling ending -Successfully a horrifying and disturbing film -cool homages to the original CONS: -The PG-13 rating is misleading. The film is really full of very mature and dark themes and I think an R rating would be more appropriate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original that was made in 1971 and i haven't heard of the director Glen Morgan since he only directed a couple of X-Files episodes before. Crispin Glover plays Willard Stiles, who still lives with his mother and doesn't have a girlfriend or any friends at all. Glover works for R. Lee Ermey, who screwed over his dad for the company and only keeps Glover there because his mother is still alive. Laura Harring plays a co-worker who pities Glover and tries to be his friend. There are some rats in the basement and Glover at first tries to kill them but he ends up becoming their master. Crispin Glover is great this this role and i don't know if this is better then the original because i haven't seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I might not be a big fan of remakes but "Willard" is definitely one of my favorite horror remakes I've ever seen. The style is different from the original, in that it mixes Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho" and "Birds" (if "Birds" was actually called "Rats") but also if these movies were directed by Tim Burton. The movie is very well directed and the build up the ending is quite good. Crispen Glover is Willard essentially, the fact that he did not get an Oscar nomination for this film is quite disappointing, but he is also very weird like in every movie he has been in. But the film's metaphors and motif's are very well presented, and the way the film was essentially everything a good remake should be, a film that is more about be true to the original story but is not exactly the same, and in fact adds on to the original. The film is not perfect, in fact the film is not without its faults, and minor plot holes and if you do not like horror films or rats this is not the film to see. But it is a film that is very artistic and if you are looking for a great HORROR movie remake than this is the film to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's probably the most adequate way to describe what I was thinking as the credits rolled for Willard, the 2003 version because, while normally I'm the first to whine about how quick we are in the entertainment industry to spread filth upon the world with sequels and remakes I don't care how good the original 1971 version was it DIDN'T HAVE CRISPIN GLOVER and THAT, my children, is a deal-breaker as far as I'm concerned...Crispin Glover's performance was staggeringly good. I mean it was amazing. The only other movie I've seen him in was that piece of garbage Tim Burton spewed out of his backside about a girl named Alice who travels to this magical land and attends a tea party with a Had Matter or something like that. I forget what it was called, but I guess it was pretty popular and Glover played the Knave of Hearts, or Stayne. And his role, while not exactly small, felt rather insignificant which I think is a gosh darn shame because I hadn't realized how amazing an actor he is. He's far better than the world gives him credit for. I found myself so immersed into this movie by his performance that every time he started to cry about something else horrible happening in his life, I was crying right along with him....There's just no better way to describe it other than really, really good. Great. Fantastic. Amazing. It renewed my faith in the cinematic world. Even if it WAS a remake.This review was (severely) edited for content and length.

		<fullReview>...and in my humble opinion,except for Ernst Borgnine,Glen Morgan outdistances the 1971 original version.It was not a hard task ,mind you,cause that version was rather listless ;it's not the same problem as that of "the haunting" (1963) and its "remake" .I take Crispin Glover any day over Bruce Davison -here represented by an apparition as Willard's father on the photographs-.Davison was too boy-next-door,too good -looking.Glover gives a raw,dirty, over the top performance.The special effects are far superior to the original's and for once it was necessary.The love affair is kept to the very minimum -no intimate dinner for Willard and Cathryn- focusing on the poor lad's humiliations (it is a kind of male "Carrie" )Glen Morgan has a good sense of humor ,often black humor: the nursery rhyme "Three blind mice " (See how they run/They come to take you away)comes back several time ,always at the right moment.I dig this line when the boss is killing Willard's pet : "Hi Disney,this is Mickey Mouse speaking! We 'll meet again!" Another hilarious sequence: the boss is watching naked women on his computer and realizes that his mouse ...has turned into a rat!The endings of the two versions are different ,but I have my doubts: might they think of "Willard 2"?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching Willard is rather like torture. It's not a boring movie, and it's got good production value, but it sucks you into a downward spiral that lacks any sort of catharsis. We are introduced to the character of Willard and come to sympathize with him, as his sick mother and holier-than-thou boss constantly berate and belittle him. But it seems that as soon as Willard has our sympathies, the movie plunges into his descent, and we the viewer are left absolutely helpless, thinking, "No, Willard! Don't do that!" At one point in the movie, I actually had to pause the DVD and take a breather in order to continue. I can't even remember the last time I had to do that. The movie left me feeling anxious, angry, and depressed, but without catharsis. I personally didn't feel it had any underlying value to it, and I didn't gain any fresh insight into life while watching it. However, this isn't to say that the movie is completely worthless. Although it left me with severely negative feelings, the production design was quite good (I enjoyed how everything about Willard himself was anachronistic), the acting was likewise fine, the cinematography was also great, and it DID manage to produce a strong reaction in me, albeit not a positive one. So I just thought i would warn the IMDb community that while this movie itself is not bad, it's not enjoyable. In fact, I would go so far as to call it a masochistic experience. You've been warned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great ReMake That Does Not Disappoint.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film may be a Re-make but.....We believe that is better than the original. The main character "Willard" is more well developed as a believable person. This helps sell the story of the "young professional" living at home with his decaying mother (after his fathers tragic suicide when he was a child). The Rats are incredible in the film. They are far more menacing and realistic. Instead of seeing the usual "stock file footage" of generic rats. We see Willard being able to command hordes of Rats and sometimes being covered in them....Yes, we know that it is all due to the marvelous technology called CGI. All in all, it is a great creepy thrill to see that many nasty, hairy little beings (seemingly) all in one place. (you can almost smell them.) The end scene is great. This movie is so entertaining, you not so bored as to check for the plot holes. We rate this film as being A+. For a Remake it is really and surprisingly good. You have to hand it to the Casting Director for Casting "Crispin Glover". He Pulls off the character "Willard" so very well. So well that you do feel sorry for "Willard", and want the Rats to exact revenge for him. Right down to the final scene. This film does not disappoint!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recall Crispin Glover's appearance on the Letterman show and was amazed by one of the funniest, greatest interviews ever. It taught smug Dave a lesson when he threw a kick at him. Crispin is so full of talent that I really want to see more of his works.In Willard, Crispin really shows the world that this man lives in and his unfortunate plight. He's not really a demented, crazed person, but finds himself passively facing tough obstacles in life: mundane work, caring for his mom, and yearning for glory days of old. This really comes through well through the home as signs of age and time past are simply conveyed through dusty ledges and old mementos. Crispin Glover is Willard. The way he copes with his ordeal and finally finds a confidante in Socrates who Crispin really handles as an actual friend is fun and endearing. Then, there are lots of dark parts where there's only so much a he can take without resorting to action. Frank Martin viciously plays the antagonist here who's callous, heartless corporate stature tests Willard to the breaking point; let's face it: you really can't stand this boss! The computer scene in the office was amusing too! I am also partial to this movie since it was set in New York. The scene of Willard taking the 7 train was great!This funny, dark, and sometimes sad story is enhanced by a terrific Crispin Glover, great setting and tone mixing for a unique environment, and good supporting characters. Oh, let's not forget Willard's legion and watch for Ben too...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having not seen the original 'Willard', I can't compare it to the 1971 horror flick. This 'Willard' is a somewhat fresh approach to dark comedy/horror, given the large number of 'slasher' films made in the last two decades. 'Willard' returns to a theme of nature's revenge, but offers a few twists that involve the title character and his sinister ability to communicate with rats. ***WARNING! SPOILERS FOLLOW!***Willard Stiles(Crispin Glover)is something of a social misfit who lives in a mansion with his elderly, ill mother. His boss at Martin-Stiles Manufacturing, Frank Martin (R. Lee Ermey)is a mean-spirited, nasty 'boss from Hell', who detests Willard personally and has his greedy eyes set on Willard's house. His mother (Jackie Burroughs) says she can smell rats in the basement, but when Willard goes to kill them, he discovers a white rat whom he makes friends with, and names him 'Socrates'. A second rat - considerably bigger than Socrates - is also discovered, and is named 'Ben', because of his huge size. Ben is a defiant leader amongst the multitudes of rats while Socrates is viewed by Willard as the main leader of them all. Willard discovers that, with Socrates' help, he can command the rats to carry out orders. Mr. Martin incurs the ire of his staff, including the beautiful new office temp, Cathryn (Laura Harring) by humiliating Willard in front of them and trapping him in an elevator. Cathryn frees Willard from the elevator, and tries to reach out to Willard more than once by visiting him outside work. But Willard is too shy to accept the lovely Cathryn's help, and things reach a boiling point when Willard's mother dies and Frank Martin fires Willard days later. In addition, Willard finds out through his family lawyer (whom, we are led to believe, is actually working with Frank Martin) that the house is about to be reclaimed by the bank to recover his late father's unpaid debts - debts Willard was unaware of. Minutes after Frank Martin fires Willard, Cathryn also quits angrily. But Willard's grief is compounded when Frank Martin kills Socrates after the rat is discovered in a storage room by Martin's secretary. Willard, Ben and the thousands of rats pay Frank Martin a visit that night, and Martin does not escape - he is killed by the mob of rats, acting on Willard's command.***END SPOILER WARNING***Crispin Glover does a superior job of the title role - it's similar to his role as the murdering teen in 'River's Edge' with a dash of George McFly from 'Back to the Future' thrown in. Combining the role of an unstable mind with that of the 'nerd' who doesn't fit in, Glover portrays Willard as a character the audience can feel sympathetic towards and be repulsed by at the same time. R. Lee Ermey (who most people will remember as the foul-mouthed, colorful, and unpleasant Marine Corps drill instructor in Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket') is also brilliant as the corporate-sociopath Martin. Ermey - once a Marine D.I. in real life - combines the brutality of a drill instructor's sharp tongue with that of a 'respectable' man in a 3-piece suit. Laura Harring is also excellent as the strong-willed and feisty Cathryn, who also shows a gentle and compassionate side towards a man few people want anything to do with.I agree with one of the other writers who stated that the director &amp; producer went overboard to ensure a PG-13 rating. Having seen the alternate/deleted scenes offered on the DVD, I found most of these added the element of dark humor and a better picture of the relationship between Cathryn &amp; Willard. Another writer made a valid point that there were 'not enough bullies killed'. Admittedly, this isn't a film that's entirely about revenge, but it certainly has a strong enough role in the story and could have been expanded on. All things considered, 'Willard' was something of a welcome change from the slasher-type films of the last 20 years, but it certainly could have been improved on in terms of a storyline. The characters are interesting and definitely believable - what's missing here is a little more of the 'horror' element.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glover perfectly cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is yet another remake of a 1970's film that was extremely popular in it's day and while I do think that the original was a tad scarier this version benefits from an effective job of casting. Story is about a nerdy loser named Willard Stiles (Crispin Glover) who lives with his old and sick mother Henrietta (Jackie Burroughs) and works in the office of a company that his deceased father started. Willard's boss is the tyrannical Frank Martin (R. Lee Ermey) who loathes him and berates him in front of the other workers. At work one morning Willard notices a pretty temp named Cathryn (Laura Harring) and she seems to feel sorry for him but he is much to shy to talk to her. One day at home Willard discovers rats in his cellar and contemplates killing them but he befriends a white rat and names him Socrates. He teaches his new friend and all the other rats to obey his commands but a very big rat that he calls Ben pops up and Willard talks to him and tells him that Socrates is in charge.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Henrietta dies after discovering the rats in the cellar and after the funeral Frank won't let anything stop him from getting the house that Willard grew up in and even fires Willard from his job. Willard has brought Socrates to work and hides him in the supply room but is discovered by one of the employees which results in Frank killing Socrates. That night Willard and Ben and the other rats pay Frank a visit and after they chew him to pieces Willard abandons them with the hope that they will all go away but they don't and now Willard is Ben's target for payback.This film is directed by Glen Morgan who makes his debut as a director and he's well known as a producer and a writer. While I don't think that this is especially scary I have to admit that this film does establish a legitimate mood and eeriness that I found effective. Some of the scenes with the rats are computer generated and unless your deathly afraid of rodents this really doesn't come off as a horror film. The film benefits from two very good choices in it's casting and the first is Ermey as Frank and his background in the Marine Corps. comes to use as he yells and insults Willard. Glover is the key to this film and without him this would be a film easily forgotten but Glover is such a good actor that his performance makes the viewer believe his sadness and loneliness. My favorite scene takes place when Willard puts a poor cat in his house and when the cat looks at the ocean of rats in front of him he immediately starts to urinate on the floor! One aspect of the film clearly doesn't work and there is no way that Harring's character would be interested in someone like Willard. In real life she would pity him and that would be as far as she would go with it. On a trivia note, the photo's of Willards father is of actor Bruce Davison who starred in the original 1971 film. This remake does have it's moments but the best thing about this film isn't the rats but the effective performance by Glover.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>33 years ago it was decided to make a movie about lonely guy falling in love with a rat. *Blinks*....Okaaaaaaaay....guess it was a 70s thing. Regardless.....this movie was given a modest budget....enough to pay for a couple of capable actors, a 35mm camera and a bunch of trained rats.....and allowed go. Amazingly this seemingly off the wall, nowhere flick not only became quite a sleeper hit of 1971.....but it also spawned a equally weird sequel two years later.....and in 2003....a remake. It is this more current film upon which I shall focus. In the 2003 update we have resident weirdo Willard Styles who looks like a refuge from the Addam's family....living a drab, lonely exsitance. Then comes that magic day when catching rats in the basement he stumbles upon Sorcrates.....The handsome white mouse of his dreams. He spares Sorcrates, earning him the undying affection of albino beauty and the loyalty of the local rodent society. Willard soon decides to train his new pals to do his bidding....in various....often illegal ways. As the training sessions intensify....so does the affection between Willard and Sorcrates. Soon this ain't just a friendly owner pet thing......it's full blown love!!! Unfortunately for our cross species lovers....several stumbling blocks arise that threaten their budding affair. Willard's aged...addled....mother who clings to her son like saran wrap. Kat: Willard's pretty, sympathetic co-worker who for seems to be taking a romantic interest in Willard. Willard's ogre of a boss....who for undisclosed reasons wants to buy Willard's house out from under him....a move that would force Willard away from his sewer dwelling pals. And finally....Ben. The hulking former king rat whose position as the big cheese of the rodent set has been usurped by Willard.Willard has some interesting aspects and performances. Crispen Glover in the title is appropriately offbeat. And R. Lee Ermey plays the nasty boss role to the hilt. But the overall concept of the film is so weird and implausable its hard to become overly interested in the proceedings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Spoiler~ I'm impressed. Willard is one of the few remakes I've actually enjoyed more than the original. You know why that is: because the original wasn't a great film to begin with. There is no reason to remake films that are already perfect. And the original Willard is far from perfect. Those are the movies that Hollywood should be returning to. For the most part, they stuck with the original storyline and that puts a smile on my face. They made the film itself much darker though and I really enjoyed the look. Crispin Glover is amazing as Willard re-envisioned. Glover is a talented actor who has a knack for playing quirky characters. This is one of his best roles. Willard Stiles is a pathetic creature. His mother belittles him, his boss despises him, and his only true friend is a little white mouse named Socrates. Willard doesn't know that he has a more powerful friend in Ben. Ben is a large rat and obviously the leader of the pack. Willard believes he has the power to control the rats. He doesn't. Ben controls the rats and Willard should have never turned his back on him. That's where the plot really lies: friendships. The other actors are well-suited as well. R. Lee Ermey is every bit the b*stard Ernest Borgnine was. I love watching that guy act. And Laura Harring is very sympathetic and gorgeous. I only had one problem with the film. I still don't like the ending. I think Willard and Ben should have died together. I would call it a perfect film if that would have happened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually begging my reviews like this but?. I loved this movie!!In my eyes this is a flawless film. As a huge Tim Burton fan, it is easy to see why. It has all of the gothic style of a Burton film?. And Glen Morgan is definitely a director I will be looking out for in the future.Willard had me hooked from the very beginning. The opening credit sequence is great, and it is not unlike the credit sequence of House on Haunted Hill. The constant shadow of black which lurks over the movie is a character unto itself. Crispin Glover (the master of introverted characters) is the key to this film and he looks comfortable and confident at the helm.My only qualm about Willard was the character (rat) named BEN. He just looked too much like a possum as opposed to a gigantic rat. But it's a nit-pick which I am happy to put aside. With that exception, there is nothing bad I can say. The musical sequence involving a very nervous kitty is hilarious?.very morbid and not for cat lovers! I am not a cat lover, so I LOVED that scene. I am a massive horror fan (as I expect most of you are) and the lack of gore did not bother me in any way, shape or form. It may have taken away from the gothic comic book edge. Also, as a Video Store manager I am delighted that this film had no gore, as I am able to play it throughout my store for all to see. After 9:00pm that it. ?. It's still pretty morbid without the gore.Do yourself a favour if you love a good ol' quirky comic-like horror. Rent this movie. It's great!I rate this one 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glover shines in this remake of the cult classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WILLARD (2003) *** ? Crispin Glover, R. Lee Ermey, Laura Harring. In this remake of the 1971 Daniel Mann film, Crispin Glover stars as Willard Stiles, a lonely, slightly unhinged, loser who trains an army of rats to do his bidding. The movie is a little hard to get into at first because the silly premise, but Glover really sells it and, later on at least, it doesn't seem so unbelievable. Aside from Glover's excellent acting, other high points include Ermey's in-your-face performance as Willard's abusive boss, stylish direction by Glen Morgan and terrific special effects (the computer-generated rats are surprisingly lifelike), all of which combine to make this one of the best horror films in years. Not for the squeamish and definitely not for children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty decent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got around to watching it and was pleasantly suprised, it was better than I thought it would be. For one, the camera work was amazing. Great color and graphic work, and the editing effectively added the right amounts of uneasiness, suspense, etc. Crispin Glover was SO excellent in his performance and should receive an Oscar nomination (although he probably won't as snooty Oscar will shun this movie), he was the perfect casting choice for Willard. Jackie Burroughs was effectively repulsive as his mother and R. Lee Ermey for the most part did well although his last scene could of been a lot more dramatic, he doesn't do death very well. The story itself was well done for the most part. The only complaints I have is the cheesy and inappropriate into-like someone else on here said, it made the movie look like it was Beetlejuice or Danny Elfman or something. Definitely not keeping in tone with the rest of the movie. Also, on the DVD, there were the usual deleted scenes along with the original ending. The original ending was sooo much better than the ending that ended up in the film-they should of never listened to the test audience. Even a couple of the deleted scenes would of filled in some minor holes that were otherwise not explained, but it was nothing glaringly overlooked. Overall this is a decent movie and I would recommend it. My score: 6.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the rare remakes that's superior to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>New Line had only six weeks to promote this film -- according to the outstanding documentary on the DVD -- and blew it anyway. They were targeting teenage boys when they should have been targeting older people and teenage &gt;girls&lt;.  Glen Morgan directs in a very interesting stylized fashion almost as eccentric as David Lynch or Tim Burton, and Crispin Glover gives a knockout performance in the title role. It's a dark, twisted story, just as it should be; the original WILLARD lightened up the very strange novel, but this one takes several big steps in the direction of the novel. (Not so far as to have Willard Styles wear a rat mask, though.)  The movie does have some awkward elements; the pacing is a bit off, probably because the structure is askew a bit, but overall, it's a fascinating, creepy movie, very well made with fine performances. And either the original ending or the reshot one would have satisfied me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rats!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Willard struggles! Every person inn his life is somehow pushing him down, and his self-esteem is non-existent. He lives with his mother in his old childhood house, and this guy should have moved out long ago!His boss really hates him, and looks at him as a pitiable little loser! The only reason he let Willard keep his job, it because he in the past promised Willard's father to let his son have a job as long as his mothers still alive. And Willard is kind of a loser, and his mother knows that! One of my favourite scenes is where Willards mother criticizes his son's name. `Willard, from now on your name is Clark...good night Clark!' Inn that moment, and without any real taught, she crushes his soul and identity, and tells him his not worth a dam s***, and she doesn't even realise it! And that is the story of Willard's life in a nutshell. Nobody cares about him, and those few who does, don't get him and hurts him unintentionally. And those who think they gets him, despises him. Nobody sees under his skin, and he is often misunderstood.But in the basement some much-needed friends suddenly shows up, and slowly he develops a strange and close relationship with rats. Especially one of them! He develops a strange and bizarre love relationship with this white rat. He sleeps with it, and talk to it like a human being. He trains the rest of them, and the more his boss and people push him, the clearer Willards intension get. He wants revenge; he is tired of being pushed around.But Willard lacks some simple human skills, and those skills may possibly have saved him for much of the troubles he is in for, namely the skill of tackling jealousy, and the skill of diplomacy.I loved this movie! Its dark, its bizarre, and Crispin Glover is brilliant as Willard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a remake that can improve on the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that every year Hollywood launches dozens of remakes. Oddly, they tend to be remakes of films that need very little improvement. Why do it again if you admired the original so much? It seems the more logical course would be to choose a film that had potential, but didn't quite manage to reach it.Thus, Willard. Though the basic premise and certain images certainly stuck in the memories of many who saw it in the 70's, it certainly can't be counted among the classics, and there is definite room for improvement. In the hands of Glen Morgan &amp; James Wong (who I personally believe were the REAL creative force behind the X-Files), the story's promise is fulfilled. This version contains just enough homage to the original to satisfy its fans (the portrait of Bruce Davison and the humorous use of the song "Ben" in particular), while bringing enough new dimension on board to create an admirable film in its own right.Special credit goes, of course, to Crispin Glover's performance. I doubt that his special brand of off-kilter charm has ever been put to better use. Given that the central conflict is between Glover and a mute rodent, his acting skills and some creative editing are essential in making the story work. And of course, modern effects technology brings some extra pizazz to the rat stampedes that the original simply couldn't manage.Is it scary? It depends on your tolerance for rats, I suppose. Speaking as someone who has no particular aversion to them, I can't say I was disturbed at any point here. But even without the creeps, this is an interesting and offbeat character study. If you're expecting a Friday The 13th kill-fest (as some reviewers here clearly were, the troglodytes), then this may disappoint you. But for those who like some depth to their horror, "Willard" at worst qualifies as a guilty pleasure. At best, it's an undiscovered gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's take on Rats of Nym</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have to say this is one of the best thrillers of the year. Whether it be the Hitchcock camera shots, Crispen's amazing acting or the sequence using the Jackson 5's song 'Ben', you get to witness a great gothic film played like a Greek tragedy. Wonderfull lighting and camera angles gives you a mood resembling Disneyland's Haunted Mansion. The effect used for the rats was completely believable and really draws you in to the inside story. What really stands out though is Crispen Glover's character. Honestly, I would consider it Academy Award material, though we know it'll never get there. He gives such convincing angst and emotion you root for him all the way to the end. Overall the movie has a Tim Burton makes the 'Rats of Nym' vibe that horror and suspense fans will come to adore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the DVD last night and I really enjoyed it. I haven't seen the original, so I can't add my thoughts on the debate "better/worse than the original". I was expecting a scary movie, I got a finely crafted thriller instead. True, it's not scary but what a story and what a performance from Crispin Glover! He deserves an Oscar, he IS Willard more than he is playing him. I was blown away by Ben as well. I still have to watch the making of documentary, and I am unable to tell if Ben was an animatronic or a real rat (probably a combination of both) but he did look really evil and his presence itself brings tension.An excellent surprise, well recommended! Plus, don't miss Glover's weird and hilarious "Ben" video!4 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben's here again, for the first time. ??? Well... This movie was just every bit as good as the original. Perhaps better? I think Crispin Glover was quite the better 'Willard' than Davison -and I didn't think that could be possible. In the case of Glover, he just fits the part of a nervous, disturbed misfit to a (ra)T. If there were an alternate universe where the world was dark and evil; this would be a Disney movie. In fact, it starts out with Socrates in a Disneyesque manner. However, as it progresses into darkness, it becomes the nightmare it was meant to be.I also thought it was a classic move to play the 'Ben' theme that Michael Jackson did for the sequel to Willard. A good gloat to that stinker of a movie (well, stinker if you're looking for a sequel to a horror movie).And R. Lee Remey (i think that's how it's spelled) just seems he has a nack for playing oppressive roles that drive characters into madness. Not that Willard wasn't already nearly there.Music, atmosphere, gore, and disturbing images that are not shown; this movie has 'em all. I just wonder why Crispin Glover is so underused. Maybe people really are afraid of him &lt;8O)Doesn't it seem like there's a little Ben in all of us?Well... 7/10 for me... thank youp.s. Does anyone know if the singer of 'Ben' song at the ending credits is actually Crispin Glover... i thought it sounded like him.</fullReview>

Though I fear him being typecast in a film of this sort he gave us everything he had in his portrayal of WILLARD. I will agree with Hyde in that I wish there were more deaths related to the little critters but for a PG-13 rating they did a good job and even made me feel a little bit creepy when Willard was covered with the rats. I didn't get the chance to check out all the special features but listened to commentary by Glover on the music video made for the film - the song "Ben". it seemed a bit rushed and pre-planned but it wasn't that long of a video. Probably would be a good thing to check out the regular commentary on the film.Jekyll's Rating :I think this film should be given a chance and my rating is 4 stars it is now out on video, check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Willard (when it was released in 1971) was a sleeper at the box office, it must have shocked everyone! I cannot even begin to imagine the studio executives words when they originally saw the script to this (what a great story a boy and his rat!). Ernest Borgnine said that his only career regret was taking a straight salary for this film and not a share of the profits, Willard was such a big hit he lamented that he could have made a lot more money. Crispin Glover is probably best remembered for his role as "the creepy thin man" in the Charlie's Angels films, his myterious character doesn't say a word in either one. He is a fine actor who can convey wierdness and menace and at the same time make you feel sorry for him. He is so good at using facial expressions and body language that I think he would have made a great silent film actor! He is a much more creepy Willard then Bruce Davison was in the original. He still has the same problems with his mother, he is sort of like Norman Bates in Psycho. He still lives in the same creepy house and has the same go-nowhere job where everyone dumps on him. The only thing that is different in this film is....R. Lee Ermey HOORAH!!!!He dominates every role he plays. He is like a roaring lion in a roomful of kittens. I feel sorry for ANYONE who acts with him because he will blow you right off the screen. This man is probably the finest actor working in films today. He doesn't just tap on your window he huffs and puffs and BLOWS YOUR HOUSE DOWN!!!HOORAH!!!He takes no prisoners, he takes names and kicks your ass! He makes Ernest Borgnine's character look like the nicest boss in the world! He brings to his role of Mister Martin the same intense, in your face no bs quality that he brought to his role of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in Full Metal Jacket! He is what makes this film for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film! An obscure curiousity, perfectly acted, shot, and scored.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main title sequence that opens `Willard' is one of the most visually striking open title sequences in recent memory. The camera is panning across small tables, and picture frames with 2D or object animation playing within them. The only way I can accurately describe it would be that it seems like a stylization of a camera looking around the nooks and crannies of an old wooden cellar or basement. It was created with good old fashioned stop-motion animation model work. Shirley Walker's opening title music is nothing short of magnificent, and the accordion-laden composition perfectly anticipates the character we are about to meet.`Willard' is a very well observed story that intimately knows it's lead character. It's a film that's quirkily disturbing, and funny too. Crispin Glover's Willard character has very dark eyes, is very pale, and has a slick, short, combed-back haircut. He almost looks like he stepped out of a silent film. His performance brings pain and longing right in your face with his twitches, the way he responds to anger, how he wants to say something but doesn't, and especially by the way he walks. There is also real wit in the performance, and Glover is overall a delight to watch.Willard is a sensitive, deeply disturbed grown man who is constantly being mentally tormented by the people around him. His mother talks down on how much of a waste he is, his boss is arrogant and enjoys threatening him at work, and nobody else seems to pay attention to him. Nobody, except for Catherine (played by Laura Elena Harring of `Mulholland Drive'), a fellow emplyee who seems to be a potential social isle for Willard, as she shows sympathy for him and actually talks to him at work, but he never pursues a friendship. While in the cellar setting rat traps, Willard beings to sympathize with the rats he's laying traps for, and befriends them, particularly one white rat, who he has named Socrates.Shirley Walker's score is undeniably the heart and soul of the film. It's a powerful, thematic work that's one of the finest film scores of recent years, and the finest horror score in ages. As some modern-day viewers are aware of when watching newer films, an orchestral score for a cultish horror piece is a rare and sublime gift. The approach and feel of this score is a brilliant homage to Bernard Herrmann. The music knows exactly what emotions it's attempting to bring out in the viewer as it digs deep inside the story and the inner feelings of our lead character. It's a terrific segueing of music and image, and it's Shirley Walker's greatest achievement.I can see people having problems with the ending. I personally thought the ending was campy and creepy, with Glover at his most insane, though some may complain that it runs a few minutes longer than it's natural climax. On a narrative level, I was satisfied with this ending, I got the same vibe that I felt during the ending of the silent film `The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' (both films end in similar settings).`Willard' was a $22 million dollar film, but it made barely $7 million back. The film didn't find it's audience, which is a shame. Part of the problem was that it opened in March, which isn't the time of year to release a film like `Willard' (October is the ideal time). Thankfully, New Line Cinema seems to feel that the film deserves a second life on DVD, because the `Willard' DVD is jammed-pack with goodies. A highlight is a music video of the song `Ben,' sung by Crispin Glover. The music video is striking and marvelous, and surprisingly visually owes just about everything to Federico Fellini (which was indeed surprising, since the film itself has no Felliniesque quality). Crispin is seen flying down on a stage, the audience composed of strange-looking people looking at the camera with mocking or deadly serious expressions. Fellini is alive in this, right down to the very sexually suggestive nature of the music video. IT'S REALLY GOOD STUFF!!!!`Willard' is a rare kind of film in these days. It's an obscure curiosity, a film most studios wouldn't gamble with, and it's wildly vast difference from everything else we see these days is one of the reasons why I love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Caution: May contain Spoilers Excellent dark piece of cinema.As a fan of the original I doubted the remake. I was completely blown away and it far exceeded my expectations for the good. Starting with Crispin Glover's performance. He did wonderful job of portraying an outcast of society that faces the cruelty of man. No one in Hollywood could match the perfection he brought to the role of Willard. As usual his performance will be over looked by Hollywood and the Academy Awards. Which he well deserves one for this. I thought the film flowed very well. The script upon itself brought a great feeling and remorse for Willard and the rats. Both are cast out by society. Nobody loves rats and nobody loves Willard. Their friendship bonded from not belonging and then using each other to claim revenge. The dark humor is perfectly placed. No off the wall humor thrown in that doesn't fit which is so common in films today. It is a shame that more people won't give this gem a chance. It is more than a film about a man who controls rats. It's a film about not belonging, loneliness, sadness, mankind's cruelty, finally fitting in,revenge of those who cause grief, and the results of using a friend.</fullReview>

The story mingles various aspects of Alfred H. and a Twilight Zone episode. Crispin's character has certain elements of what made Anthony Perkins so believable in the original Psycho film. The supporting cast is worthwhile, especially character actor R. Lee Ermy and the actress who is the mother of Willard. Dark humor elements make the film work on more than one level. Also, it would be interesting to see Crispin star in a mainstream silent picture of some sort. The actress who plays Catherine is used very well in the feature. The rats were a good comic relief to the cold and distant seriousness of the Willard character. And so, on a scale from one to ten: I give this film a solid seven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Willard Stiles is a lost soul with an empty life and no friends. His days are spent working for a boss that despises him and only keeps him on because he contractually obligated to do so, and caring for his bedridden, overbearing mother who has no respect for him. His life is changed, however, when his mother complains of rats in the basement, `I've always been able to smell mice,' she says. Apparently, she can because in Willard's attempts to rid the house of said vermin, he discovers that the house is indeed infested with rats. One rat, which Willard rescues from a trap, is an especially smart rat that Willard names Socrates. Socrates becomes Willard's only friend.`Willard' is a remake of the 1971 cult film that starred Bruce Davison as Willard and Ernest Borgnine as Willard's sleazy, cruel, boss, Mr. Martin. The remake stars Crispin Glover (`Back To The Future,' `River's Edge') as Willard and R. Lee Ermey (`Full Metal Jacket') as Mr. Martin. It also features Laura Elena Harring (`Mulholland Drive') as a potential love interest and Jackie Burroughs (`The Dead Zone') as Willard's mother.Socrates helps Willard to train the other rats to chew through and destroy whatever Willard wishes them to chew through and destroy, starting with the tires of Mr. Martin's brand new Mercedes. There is one fly in the ointment, a gigantic rat named Ben (as in Big Ben.) Ben is just as smart as Socrates but more cunning and rebellious. Willard loves Socrates, but he (rightfully) doesn't trust Ben and eventually learns to fear him. Glover is brilliant as Willard Stiles. Anyone who has ever been lonely can identify with him. His love for Socrates is very believable and touching while understandably strange. As the movie goes on and Willard becomes more and more unhinged, Glover brings the right note of nuttiness to the role without overdoing it. Ermey does what he does best which is a lot of screaming and yelling at Willard. Burroughs as Willard's mother is also good and her make up makes her look half past dead. Laura Harring's character, Kat (I'm sure the pun was intended) is unnecessary and as a result her performance is wasted.`Willard' does contain a homage to the original film. Bruce Davison (The original Willard) is used in photos and a painting as Willard's deceased father. The song `Ben,' from the original film's titular sequel is also used twice. Once in a darkly comic scene in which we really see Ben's true nature and his control over the other rats (a scene that might make cat lovers a little uncomfortable.) and over the closing credits, this time sung by Willard himself, Crispin Glover.`Willard' is not a bad movie but it isn't a great movie either. It looks great and the acting is generally very good. Unfortunately, there is a minor hole in the plot near the end of the movie (I won't say what it is so as not to spoil the ending) and the movie itself is a little slow and predictable. The sequel-ready ending is a bit much too. Also, the marketing of the movie makes it look like a straight up horror movie and this is not the case. If the writer intended `Willard' to be a horror movie, he has failed miserably. Unless you are creeped out by rats, this movie isn't going to scare you. But if the intention was to make you feel pity for this pathetic man then `Willard' is a resounding success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Willard: A cross between the X Files and Twilight Zone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Willard seems to me a cross between a really good episode of The X Files and a really good episode of the Twilight Zone. It has some good creepy elements (the rats of course). His house is like Willard's personality. It is dark and creepy. But under it all, it is more of a dark comedy. But that doesn't mean it's not a good movie. Crispin Glover is the perfect person to play Willard. He really catches Willard's pathetic, lonely, and creepy personality. I really think that this was an awsome movie. I am going to buy it on DVD when it comes out. I give this movie **** stars and an A+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>misunderstood dark comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed Willard. It's excellently acted by Crispin Glover, and paints a haunting picture of a pathetic loner who finds friendship in rats that have infested his basement. That brief description of the plot sounds ridiculous for a movie, but you just can't take it too seriously, as the tone of the movie is never too serious. In other words, it's not a horror. I went to see it with some friends who just didn't get it. They thought it was just another horror movie, so they thought it was cheezy and funny. When Willard first befriends the rats, it would be a ridiculous scene in a horror movie, but it works well in this dark comedy. Some of the lines are funny, but I believe that was the directors intentions. Other times the movie is very clever. Willard's mom is also excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most perversely charismatic crazy to hit the screen in years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Glen Morgan, who paid his dues writing episodes of The X-Files, and its assorted spin-offs, and then finally made his big screen debut with his script for the original, Final Destination, has taken his directorial cues from masters of oddity such as Tim Burton, Barry Sonnenfeld (during his Addams Family phase) and George Miller. Morgan manages to create an unforgettable atmosphere that holds its own against, Beetlejuice, Babe: Pig in the City, Addams Family Values or Sleepy Hollow. Like all of those films, this is a dark comedy. Unlike those films, it becomes deadly serious, and that turns into what is nearly its downfall.The further we get into the film, the darker the movie gets. About halfway through, we're no longer watching a dark comedy, but rather a fairly weak attempt at horror. The film doesn't succeed in scaring you, so the last half of the movie essentially fails. Only those lovable, huggable rats, and Crispin Glover's performance, pull it through. The best, and easily most comedic, scenes in the film feature Willard and his mother, and take place early on in the picture. During these moments, the film oozes of the original Psycho, only this time, "Norman's" mother isn't a corpse. Crispin Glover is the most perversely charismatic crazy to hit the silver screen since Anthony Perkins took on Norman Bates, in the original Psycho.Willard could have been a classic. As it is, it's a fine little dark comedy that gets mixed up at the end and starts believing that it's a thriller. Oh, and I can't end this review without mentioning how pleasantly nasty the scene with the cat is. Cat lovers, prepare to close your eyes ... kitty's about to get hers! The Truth about Rats &amp; Dogs? Nah ... too easy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crispin Glover, rats and overall decent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see Willard soley due to the trailer. I had no recommendations from anyone. I'll start with the negatives of this movie and then I'll tell what I liked. One of the things that hurts this film is the pace. There are lots of shots of Crispin Glover doing absolutely nothing which could have been used to further the plot. They could have possibly worked on a romance between him and Catherine (Laura Elena Harring). We could have been given a flashback of his father's suicide which would have given the movie a somewhat more serious feel. The scenes with the mother could have been a little more prominent to show more of how Willard's relationship with her was not so good due to her illness. We could have been given more scenes that show why he arrives to work late instead of just showing him arriving late at the office. Anyway that is what hurts this film. Onto the good things.The rats in this movie are great eye candy, even when they're computer generated they look great. For the part of Ben they use an African Gambian giant rat and it is perfect. Crispin Glover's over the top performance is perfect for a film which is pretty much a parody of the original and its sequel entitled Ben. The website of the film www.willardmovie.com is evidence enough as it features a music video of the song "Ben" sung by Crispin Glover. This isn't a movie to be taken seriously, it's a rat swarm movie with odd characters that should be enjoyed. Is it demented yes, is it fun yes. I recommend you see it at least once unless you're afraid of rodents. Even then you can look at it as a horror movie. I give this movie 8 out 10 for being an interesting movie which is only hampered by bad pacing. On a star system I give it *** out of 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Clever, Creepy Remake...Better Than the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must confess, I've been eager to watch this movie since I first heard it was in development. I saw the original as part of Elvira's "Movie Macabre" as a kid (easily my favorite TV show). My parents had been fans, and I must confess, for its time it was quite good.The idea of a sequel in which Ben, the killer rat, was befriended by a child, featuring a schmaltzy song by a young Michael Jackson always struck me as ludicrous. But a remake, starring Crispin Glover? That casting made it a must see.The remake features some other clever casting choices, most notably Bruce Davison, the original Willard, feautured as Charles Stiles, Willard's late father. And rather than being feautured in flashback, he appears in a portrait and older photos. Not to take away from his earlier performance, but Glover comes off much better than Davison ever did, seeming authentically lonesome and desperate.The visuals are much better. While not always a fan of his work, this movie, in many ways, seems to have taken much inspiration from the work of Tim Burton, complete with dark, neo-gothic sets (The Stiles home is a scarier Bates residence, while Willard's workplace sometimes come off like a Dickens as interpreted by Poe), and a score that almost seems cribbed from Danny Elfman's work on Burton's films.The film also has a better resolution. Whereas Sondra Locke's female lead in the 1971 original seemed to have some legitimate potential interest in Davison's Willard, Laura Harring's Cat just seems to sympathize with him.Combine all of the above with the most darkly clever use of Michael Jackson's "Ben" that could be imagined (I'm sure, if he's seen the film, he probably doesn't appreciate it).</fullReview>

The majority of us thought it was done well and had a lot of commentary on it.The cinematography of "Willard" was great. It was light, but gave off a creepy, dark feeling. Camera angles were used wonderfully, and the choice of cast was perfect. Crispin Glover came off as a great social outcast and subordinate, while the choice of R. Lee Ermey as his boss fit well within his character and acting ability.The rats looked remarkably real, and there were a lot of scenes that give you the creeps.There was a lot of allegory in the film, most notably the duality of man with the two main rats, Socrates and Ben. You'll have to see it for yourself, though.There were a few downers to the movie, but none so major as to make me dislike the film. See it, and enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insane performance makes a simple film and excellent one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, as I have read some posts for this film, Willard was not horrible. The only reason why anybody would think this movie was horrible is for two reasons. One, they saw the original and didn't think it was anything like it, which it wasn't supposed to! Two, they simply didn't like the fact that a guy could befriend a couple of rats and have to do whatever he wants them to do! So do not listen to those people!The truth is Willard is an excellent film, (Not worthy of a ten, but if anything a seven or an eight,) it is excellent because it portrays a man who has no control over his own life and is miserable everyday. He has no friends what so ever and the only friend he can find is a white rat. Crispin Glover portrays this character so well because he actually shows you what a character such as Willard has to go through and how they react.Willard was a very interesting film and if it was not for Crispin Glover's performance this movie would have sucked. But you have an actor who has nailed the character and saves the whole film. Not saying that it all rides on Crispin because the movie is still witty and fun. If any movie is worth walking out on this year it would definately be the horrible excuse for a movie Daredevil, but thats another story.Willard is not just about being completely out of your mind, (which personally I don't think he is, he just has nobody else to talk to and is extremely lonely,) and getting revenge on others because he's trained rats, but it is mainly about the emotional status. I mean come on, your telling me when you walked into that movie you never felt bad for him at all?"If you were to die, I don't know what I would do. Your the only friend I've ever had."-WillardIts too bad the academy never looks at these kind of films for performances, because Glover was insane with this role, (I mean that in a good way,) although some people might consider him to be overacting at some points in the film.Bottom line, Willard was a good movie, and this is coming from a guy who hates these kind of movies. So if you were going to see it but weren't sure, do not listen to people who come on this board and trash it, because it was a good movie! (Although I admit the ending could have been better.) 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glover shines in this remake of the 1971 horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this movie, a remake of the 1971 Daniel Mann film, Crispin Glover stars as Willard Stiles, a lonely, slightly unhinged, loser who trains an army of rats to do his bidding.Willard has a go-nowhere job at Martin-Stiles Manufacturing, which was co-founded by his now-deceased father. The company is now run by its tyrant co-founder Frank Martin, played by R. Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket). As the story unfolds, we learn that Martin bought out the shares of the elder Mr. Stiles, who, for reasons that aren't fully explained, later committed suicide. As a part of the contract, Willard was promised a job for life. Predictably, though, as soon as Willard's mother dies, Martin fires him. At that point, Willard completely loses his mind and the the real action begins.Admittedly, Willard is a little hard to get into a first because the premise of the movie is just so preposterous. At the beginning of the movie, Willard is seen trying to exterminate a white rat that he found living in his basement. Willard has second thoughts about killing him, though, so he befriends the little guy and names him "Socrates." Willard then begins to train thousands of Socrate's cohorts (including the nearly-dog-sized "Ben") to do all kinds of neat tricks, like climbing into briefcases and chewing things on command. In what seems like just a few minutes, the rats have become a well-trained army of furry little soldiers, ready and willing to do whatever Willard asks. As a viewer, you're left wondering why the rats suddenly agree to submit to Willard's control. But Glover really sells it and, later on at least, it doesn't seem so unbelievable.You'll notice right away that the film borrows heavily from Psycho, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Like Norman Bates, Willard lives alone with his half-crazed mother in a big creepy house. Like Norman, he has no friends and seems terribly afraid of women. Visually, the house looks a lot like the Bates residence, including the signature staircase. Perhaps even more obvious are director Glen Morgan's nods to the falling-down-the-stairs and shower scenes from Psycho. All in all, however, these stylistic flourishes help give Willard its eerie atmosphere. Of course, the film features plenty of original touches, too. The swarm of computer-generated rats, for example, is visually effective and definitely ups the movie's gross-out factor.Overall, the acting is pretty good, especially for a genre picture. Glover's performance is excellent throughout. Most people probably remember him from his role as George McFly in Back to the Future. In Willard, he doesn't stray too far from his McFly persona, but it still works: he is totally believable as the crazy Willard. Ermey is also effective, but perhaps a little too over-the-top, as Willard's abusive boss. Ermey is probably best known as the former real-life Marine who played the drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket, a role that he has played (unintentionally at times) in about a hundred other movies since then. He essentially reprises his part in FMJ here; in fact, through the whole movie, I kept expecting him to call Willard a "panty waste" or something.Despite a few shortcomings here and there, Willard is an effective and enjoyable film. A warning is in order, though: this movie is not for the squeamish and definitely not for children. In fact, some of it is downright painful to watch. The violence inflicted on animals in a couple of scenes is pretty harsh, even for a hardened horror-film fan like me. But if you enjoy a good psychological thriller, you'll find Willard well worth the price of admission. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish and Grim...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing remakes, I always try to seek out the original before going into the new thing. This was not the case for Willard. I've been trying to seek out the original for years now but the online auction sites haven't been kind to me. Therefore, I went into Willard with good knowledge of the original, but without seeing the original.The opening credits set the tone for a stylish and grim psychodrama. Immediately I knew this wasn't going to be some typical, point and shoot, exploitave gore-a-thon. I won't go and reiterate the plot because it's been said before. What I enjoyed so much about Willard was that the film did not have to be filled with rats popping out of people's eye sockets (as one user suggested). Aside from the rats, what made the film grotesque were the characters in the film. They were basically human monsters. The three characters, Willard, Mrs. Stiles, and Mr. Martin receive no sympathy from the viewers. While Willard should have possessed some sympathetic qualities, it leaves the viewer siding between Willard or Ben. As bizarre as it seems, Willard and Socrates' relationship has to be one of the most convincing and heart-felt in years. The sets are dark and gloomy which adds to the ghastly atmosphere. Crispin Glover is wonderful as Willard and R Lee Emery as Mr. Martin steals the movie. There should have been more character development for Laura Elena Harring's character,Catherine, though. What also works so well for the movie is the use of real rats in almost all of the scenes. There were a few CG scenes that were noticeable but still very well done. The animatronic work for Ben makes him one of the creepiest villians to grace the screen in a long time. There are several memorable scenes but the most disturbing is the literal game of cat and mouse, or in this case, cat and rats, as Michael Jackson's "Ben" plays in the background.Willard is definitely not for those seeking cheap thrills and a screen full of rats chewing into people like blocks of cheese. It will be too dreary for all those kiddies 13 and up also. I recommend Willard to anyone seeking out a stylish and creepy psychological drama.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This guy deserves an Oscar nomination for this role. Although this movie was somewhat different than the original... It was much more moving than the original.The original Willard was portrayed as more of a lunatic. In this one Crispin Glover adds depth to the character. Not just some loose nut, but someone that you can truly sympathize with.The character of Frank Martin (played very well by R. Lee Ermy) is perfectly despicable in the way that he slowly destroyed Willard and his entire families life. This film offers the character not one redeeming quality at all. You feel no empathy for this cold and souless individual. You will salivate for him to get what's coming to him.And if you saw the original... then you will see that the good aspects of it were there... but don't think that you know the ending... it's not the same.I reccomend this movie... It was a great break from my usual sci-fi menu. It's a very smart thriller that gives you a chance to root for the disturbed anti-hero Willard.</fullReview>

Go see it, its almost the same plot as the 71' version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First and foremost, let me say that Crispin Glover is what makes this movie what it is. Not the rats, not the suspense - although both come in plentiful supply - but Glover's performance as Willard. His nervous, twitching, perpetually sweating expressions will be remembered for a long time to come. That said, on to the review."Willard" is the story of a man who lives at home with his overbearing mother, keeps to himself, and gets pushed around by his boss - who is slowly taking over the business that Willard's father (now deceased) started. Things continue along this path, until Willard discovers a small white rat in his basement. It is able to get around all of the set rat-traps, so Willard befriends the rat and names it "Socrates" due to its intelligence.Not long after that Socrates' family and friends start showing up, and Willard discovers that he is able to communicate with his newfound little friends. Subsequently, he uses this power to his advantage by exacting revenge on his wrongdoers. Not all is well, though. A large, powerful rat named "Ben" shows up one day and threatens to overthrow Willard and Socrates' control over the growing rat army. Where the film goes from there, I'll let you see for yourself.As for my opinion of "Willard" I have to say that I really enjoyed the picture. Crispin Glover has proven that he is really a great actor, and deserves more than to be referred to as "George McFly." Here's hoping that he gets bigger leading roles in the future (and I don't mean "Thin Man" from Charlie's Angels, either.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Dark Cult Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will tell you a little of what I Love to see in Movies and actors so you will understand my point of View. First of all, I Love Crispin Glover, his is a Tremendously Powerful and Insanely Unique Actor. In this movie he proves this and much more. He is extremely talented and quite believable and versatile. Anyone who says the acting of this movie was poor has absolutely no idea what they are talking about. As Far as Acting goes, this Movie is very 'sound' and solid. Secondly, I Love Both Dark Movies and Cult Movies. This will be a cult classic without any hesitations. It is a remake of a 1970's movie that had a fairly close plot as this movie. Let me tell you this, the Movie 'Willard' cannot even be judged on the same scale as either of those old movies (Two movie series called Ben and Willard). This production of art is hands down better in absolutely every way then the old version. This Movies Script was very well put together, the Filming was very well done and worked in the movie and, like I stated earlier, the acting was superb and unforgettable. This movie had Crispin Glover in 95% of the scenes and he steals the attention the entire time. You have to remember, this Movie was specificly intended to be a Dark Movie, and that is exactly what it is. Even the humor itself amplifies the overall tones. If You like Dark Cult Movies and actualy know and appreciate what True acting is then you should Love this Movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Remake; Fun, but Nothing Outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first movie I ever saw was the original Willard in 1971, so 32 years later, I couldn't pass up seeing the remake. I still remember a lot of the original, and the 2003 version was pretty well faithful to it. The special effects were much improved, of course, and that added to the experience. I got the impression that there were elements of this film that the original wanted to pull off but couldn't due to the technology of the time.Crispin Glover was brilliantly cast as Willard, and he turns in a memorable performance. The make-up on the lead character was excellent, really accentuating his already rat-like appearance. Other than Glover, however, none of the other actors did much for the movie. In terms of acting, Glover carries the film, managing to play off the idea of treating people like rats and rats like people quite well.Willard's house, the main setting for the movie, is very well done. It has a moody, haunted house feel that highlights the action inside perfectly. The story is still the same as the 1971 version, relying on the idea of an alienated and emotionally stunted young man who can't connect with people. When he does connect with the rats, he turns out to be as nasty as the humans he despises -- ultimately, he tries to do the same thing to his rat "friends" as his boss has done to him; this theme culminates in his giving a speech to Ben toward the end of the film that nearly duplicates his boss' firing spiel earlier on.Overall, I found this movie enjoyable and far better than most of the poorly done horror and horror/comedy films that have been hitting the screen lately. Clearly, this is not intended to be Oscar material. This is light fare, a bit of enjoyable entertainment without a particularly deep meaning or message. In the end, this is just a movie; it's not film or cinema. It's all in good fun, and it never takes itself too seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Willard: 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've ever wondered if rodents can get revenge, here's the answer. Willard has Willard Stiles as a sociopath loner who lives in his giant house with his mother, who is even harder to look at than Kathy Bates in the hot tub in About Schmidt. He's a drone at an office that his father made with Frank Martin (R. Lee Ermey). He's not really happy with his current life, and he is very timid and shy, but we can see when he's angry. One day, he finds a rat in his basement and grows to like him and calls him Socrates. Even better, it seems that Socrates can understand perfect English and follow orders from Willard. Soon, more rats move in, including the wanna-be top-dog Ben, and they follow everything that Willard says.Willard is rather creepy, but the thing that pushes this movie is not the scares, nor all of the rats, but the performance by Crispin Glover. He, as Willard, plays his role to perfection. He didn't make me think that he was Glover, I thought of him as Willard. Many people know Glover as George McFly in the Back to the Future movies, but he's faded for awhile. He's back now, folks, and better than ever! Even if you hate horror movies, if you hate movies in general, if you hate Glover, go see this movie just to witness this extraordinary achievement in modern acting.Something I thought of impressive was all of the camera angles. Many times, they were shot from dollies and cranes, making first-time director Glen Morgan look like a natural. Ermey was also incredible, and I thought he was very good for a veteran of the screen.Laura Elena Harring, who was Rita in Mulholland Drive, has a `nothing role' as Catherine, one of Willard's co-workers who feels attracted to him. She isn't exactly the best part of the movie. One of them, however, is the music, which really set the mood. It added to the semi-scares that came about. I wasn't `freaked out', per se, but I was creeped for a majority of the movie.I'm not sure of the rats were CGI, or if they were real. If they were CGI, they looked incredible. If they were real, it must have taken a lot of time to train them. If you are a huge animal lover, I wouldn't suggest seeing this movie that pushes the limits of PG-13. If you aren't however, or you just can stomach a lot, I would recommend Willard to you.My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for terror/violence, some sexual content and language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Awesome Horror Movie with Great Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Willard starring Crispin Glover, Laura Harring, R. Lee ErmeyI have been waiting for this movie for months ever since I first seen the trailer with the wonderful comedy Final Destination 2. I am one of those film freaks who really gets excited to see a movie and can't stop talking about it. My friend Jen was probably like shut the hell up already about Willard. So on Friday March 14, 2003 at 3:05pm. I went to see Willard with my friend Bratic.As soon as the film started at the credits I knew I was going to like the movie. It started off with a Tim Burton type of opening. I leaned over to Bratic and asked him what he thought. He said it reminded him of BeatleJuice. I didn't know if that was the movie it reminded me of but it seemed like it was Tim Burton no matter what, even though he had nothing to do with this film what so ever. The movie started off great and kept on going strong. The acting by Crispin Glover was amazing. I mean the man played the Willard character perfectly. He scared me at times because he looked so evil. But he should win an award for that awesome performance. R.Lee Ermey played the asshole boss Mr. Martin wonderfully as well. I mean the acting in this film was superb.What I liked about the movie: I already mentioned above that I thought that acting was great. I also liked the pace and storyline which actually kept with the original 1971 film on some aspects but also changed a bit to make the film much more enjoyable in my opinion. The rats in the movie looked real and the background designs on the house I swear looked liked Tim Burton did them. I mean Glen Morgan, the director really made this film a pleasure to watch on every angle. He worked hard on this film and I will be the first to applaud him on this film. I also liked the ending how they changed it from the original film to make sure that if they made a sequel it wouldn't be called Ben because the original sequel was awful.What I didn't like about the movie: I pretty much enjoyed this film on every level. One complaint would be the mother's death was pretty vague and I think if they took a little more time on that scene it would have been more affective other than that I can not think of anything else off the top of my head.Willard was a cult classic in my opinion. This movie is going to bomb at the box office because it is not what it looks like from the trailer. It is a smart, well-done horror film which delivers chills, great acting and story at a steady pace. The movie will not be liked by many but I sure as hell enjoyed it. If you want to see a horror movie that is really unlike any other movie you seen then Willard is a great choice. If you're a fan of the original, I am sure you will enjoy this one.Ratings: The original Willard is a 6/10 and this Willard movie is a solid 9/10. I am hoping to see this film at least two more times before it leaves the theater, because I feel it will get better after repeat viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crispin Glover IS Willard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This guy deserves an Oscar nomination for this role. Although this movie was somewhat different than the original... It was much more moving than the original.The original Willard was portrayed as more of a lunatic. In this one Crispin Glover adds depth to the character. Not just some loose nut, but someone that you can truly sympathize with.The character of Frank Martin (played very well by R. Lee Ermy) is perfectly despicable in the way that he slowly destroyed Willard and his entire families life. This film offers the character not one redeeming quality at all. You feel no empathy for this cold and souless individual. You will salivate for him to get what's coming to him.And if you saw the original... then you will see that the good aspects of it were there... but don't think that you know the ending... it's not the same.I reccomend this movie... It was a great break from my usual sci-fi menu. It's a very smart thriller that gives you a chance to root for the disturbed anti-hero Willard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crispin carries this flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If it weren't for crispin glover this movie could have degenerated into something quite bad. The man is a master at playing these creepy, bizarre characters. I love the way his face twitches or his eyes seem to glaze over in some of the more intense moments of the film. It's great to see this hopelessly underrated actor in a lead role for a change.The film itself had a great look to it. a very stylized sort of Tim Burton thing only creepier. I loved the opening title sequence. It reminded me a little of Seven. There are a few nods to the original which are a nice touch.On the down side, this film is also a bit dull and overly long. I've never seen the original film or read the book so I couldn't really compare them. I don't think it's all that important anyway. The film should stand on it's own. There seemed to me to be way too much time spent on Willard interacting with the rats. Since the rats can't speak it was difficult to figure out exactly what was going on and why Willard behaves the way he does towards them. They try to solve this by using his dialog to explain things but it doesn't work very well sometimes.To me this film was a lot funnier than it was scary and I don't mean that in a bad way. However, the audience I was with (what little there was) didn't quite seem to get the humor. I think people were expecting more of a traditional horror film and I for one am glad they didn't get that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the remake Burton should have tackled...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is obvious to me that Willard should have been the remake that Tim Burton directed instead of Planet of the Apes. That is assuming, of course, that he would have cast Crispin Glover in the title role and not Mark Wahlberg. A movie with such a dark atmosphere and appetite for disturbance is perfect for Burton, but first time director Glen Morgan succeeds brilliantly in this beautifully twisted character study.Although Willard is advertised as a horror film, it does not sink to the level of conventional, mainstream horror. Similar to two of last year's best films, Frailty and Signs, the film's mood is vitally important in delivering the frights. Like directors Bill Paxton and M. Night Shyamalan, Morgan uses the surroundings of his characters to illustrate the tone. You may not even notice that Glover's first line clocks in at over five minutes after the peculiar opening credits. Even though the story deals with rats, they are not thrown at your face causing you to jump uncontrollably. Willard is much smarter. Sure, the rats are depicted as gross, conforming critters, but their presence is to show the absolute depression amidst Glover's Willard.This movie works as a character study, as insane as Willard is, because we are brought to an understanding that justifies his actions. Through frame after frame of tremendous aerial camera shots and Glover's amazing performance, Willard does more than entertain. We are brought into the mind of a character as sophisticated as Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates and as menacing as Christian Bale's Patrick Bateman, and, unless you are immune to animal cruelty, Willard offers, what is most likely to be, the most disturbing cinematic experience of the year. That alone constitutes a recommendation, but this rehash of the 1971 semi-classic actually breaks new ground, surpassing the original, and should justly attain cult status.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

The storyline was strange but good. I thought the movie was twisted but that is why I liked it so much. I wouldn't say it would be scary enough to fit into the horror category. More like a thriller.

There is this one point....whew...tear, sob. So, go see it.

Regardless, ole' Crispin Glover saves anything that would have otherwise bombed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, this movie has nothing to do with Willow, but it is a remake of (gasp!) Willard. I haven't seen the original, but I just came home from a sneak preview, and I must say it ain't half bad.Willard (Crispin Glover) is the epitome of introverted, as all he does is take care of his mother and show up late to his job, at a company his dad used to own but got swindled out of ownership by his partner. Willard finds rats in his basement, and begins take care of them, particularly the white mouse he names Socrates. Throughout the course of the movie he befriends some rats and makes enemies of others, and after a series of unfortunate events, uses the rats as he sees fit.While not exactly One Hour Photo on the creep factor (I'm never developing film again), it was somewhat scary throughout the whole film, and never lost the eeriness so vital to this film. This is mostly due to Crispin Glover's performance, a wonderful job of showing all the different layers of Willard's disturbed mind (especially when Willard is suppressing his inner rage...priceless).The rats are fairly impressive. While sometimes you can definitely tell when they are computer animated, especially when the rats number in the hundreds, at other times they look pretty good, and you won't notice the animatronic puppet stand-ins unless you're looking for them. Also, kudos to the trainers - those rats did some pretty nifty stuff (and yes I was sure they were real rats).Overall, it was very entertaining. It's not as scary as possible, but that's my opinion; after all, The Exorcist put me to sleep. With the combination of Glover's performance and the constant eery mood, director Glen Morgan did a fine job, especially for his first stint in the chair. I feel sorry for the cat though...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stands on its own, in fact. A cross between PSYCHO and the original WILLARD, with a couple of nice touches for fans of the original including Michael Jackson's song BEN from the 1972 sequel and a photo of Bruce Davison, the original Willard, prominently displayed in the final sequence. Crispin Glover acts up a storm as a lonely man whose only friend is a white rat named Socrates. Lee Ermey hams it up as his abusive boss, just as Ernie Borgnine did in the original. I would have liked to see another killing or two, but if nothing else this follows the plot of the original pretty faithfully -- until the climax, which was just plain hokey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*What a disappointment. I'm heartbroken. I was looking forward to Willard and his rat army. There was a lot of potential here. Now it's wasted potential.What happened? It could have been a cool horror flick. But once again, the PG-13 rears its ugly head and emasculates another horror movie. "Willard" is toothless and bloodless. So if Willard has a rat army at his disposal, to right the wrongs afflicted against him, why doesn't he use it? OK, he goes after his boss who is mean to him. And that's it! I waited 45-50 minutes for this?! And you want to talk about a letdown? If the boss kill was the highlight attack of his rat army, where was the carnage? There should have been a rat crawling in one eye socket and out his mouth! What's that you say? That's too gross? It's a killer rat movie man! Where was the blood?!! Producer: "Let's make "Willard" PG-13 so the kids can see it. We're sure to make more money that way. People love PG-13 flicks!" Hey! PG-13 stinks! Kids are going to see a boring rat flick! Great idea!All this movie had was the potential for the rats to do Willard's bidding and "tear it up". Instead they get a PG-13 rating and crawl around Willard's kitchen. Willard should have had at least five or six more bullies to kill. How about a guy who steals his parking space at work? Maybe a woman who turned him down for a date and makes fun of him at work? The rats needed a lot more bodies to tear up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty disturbing film any way you look at it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never saw the original Willard, which probably put me in a disadvantage while watching this sequel-cum-remake starring Crispin Glover in the lead role. From watching it with a fresh mind, I could see that the film had moments of inspiration, a horror movie that has few real scares but builds a lot of its feel by pure atmosphere, which indeed becomes over-bearing by the third act once the rats take over the Willard estate. Anyone who decides to see this rather B-film will know that it's best assest is its creepiness, however they may recognize that it doesn't have the shock value that the original probably contained.Glover astonishingly is really effective in the lead, as a lonely freak who looks after his deteriorating mother in a house that slowly reveals itself to be infested with rodent after rodent after rodent, which Willard clings to and controls like a gothic pied-piper. Glover captures brilliantly what's essential to his character- the perturbed eyes, the erratic and emotionally constipated attitudes, even the haircut give him an odd personality, and by the end he does give a small yet in-tune lead performance following years of supporting roles. R. Lee Ermy is equally good as the condescending boss of Willard's. The problem I saw walking out though was that there was really no one to cling to in the movie- even Ben, the largest of the rats who also resembles a beaver in a few moments, is an evil, um, rat, and as the downspiral occurs for Willard into a match between him and Ben, the movie gets exasperating. Worth a look, but don't be surprised if you feel the need to walk out for a few minutes before resuming the experience. B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Offbeat and inventive - a great modern remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of the whole horror remake craze (to say the least), but the original Willard had some good ideas that weren't capitalised on, thus making it ripe for a remake - and Glen Morgan has really capitalised on that fact with this film! There aren't many remakes I will say this for - but EVERYTHING about this film is better than the 1971 original. The plot of the original film wasn't very original - taking obvious influence from Psycho and a number of offbeat 'revenge' movies. The story here plays out in more or less exactly the same way, but more is made of it, which gives every element of it more weight. The plot focuses on a loner named Willard Stiles. Willard lives with his aging, decrepit mother in an old house. Willard works for a Mr Martin, the partner of his father in the business that belonged to the pair of them. There's some litigation that says Martin can't fire Willard - but that doesn't stop him trying! Feeling humiliated at work and at the hands of his mother, Willard turns to the rats in his cellar for friendship...One of my main criticisms of the 1971 original was that Bruce Davison wasn't creepy enough for the role. That problem has certainly been solved here as Crispin Glover was pretty much born to play this part! Glover fits the role like a glove, and even manages to convince during Willard's outburst scenes, which in fairness are pretty pathetic. The Ernest Borgnine role is taken over by R. Lee Ermey, who again fits into the role nicely. He's excellent at the sadistic roles, and this film enforces that. The opening credit sequence will give you a pretty good idea of what you're in for - director Glen Morgan has given the film a dark fantasy feel, which is brought about by the eerie old house in which most of the film takes place and the dark cinematography. The rats themselves are made much better use of in this film too, and the central pair of Socrates and Ben are almost given a human character. There's a fair bit of gore, and while the special effects can sometimes go over the top; that always fits with the style of the film. The director wasn't afraid to take a chance either - the sequence with a cat and the Jackson 5's "Ben" really ran the risk of being a little too silly, but again it comes off well. Overall, this remake is a really good film and easily one of the best modern re-imaging's. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glover vs Ermey vs Rats!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Willard (2003): Dir: Glen Morgan / Cast: Crispin Glover, R. Lee Ermey, Jackie Burroughs, Laura Elena Harring, Kimberly Patton: Laughable horror film as if the filmmakers want viewers to laugh. Crispin Glover plays Willard who is dominated by his senile mother and abusive and overbearing boss. He feels hopeless but finds friendship and companionship with a small white rat he names Socrates. When he learns that these rats will obey him he uses their incredible chewing power to deflate his boss's car tires. Another rat of mention is a big one named Big Ben whose rebellious nature retorts him to causing the death of Willard's mother. Amusing setup detailed with Willard bonding with these rats. Justice prevails despite the many tragedies. Director Glen Morgan gives an appealing 1970's look that works in a corny manner. Glover crosses sympathy with humour as someone socially lost but finds satisfaction in vengeful schemes that will eventually backtrack upon himself and his sanity. Jackie Burroughs as his senile mother is amusing yet very one note. R. Lee Ermey is ideal as his boss who eventually kills Socrates thus inviting the ultimate revenge. Laura Elena Harring is flat as a new secretary whose cat ends up in an unfortunate encounter with the rats. Not a bad remake although fans of the original may still gravitate towards it. Hokey and scare free film about power that is ultimately weird. Score: 7 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The rats are back.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second screen adaptation of Stephen Gilberts' book "The Ratmans' Notebooks", this is a fairly absorbing movie, relying heavily on the revenge formula and owing an obvious debt to Alfred Hitchcocks' "Psycho". Its strength really lies in the entertainment value of the performances - by both the human and rodent actors. Don't go into it expecting anything resembling a body count: it balances psychological terrors with some good old fashioned animal attacks. The leading character isn't 100% sympathetic - would it have killed him to make a little more of an effort at work? - but the connection that he forges with his four legged friends is touching in its own twisted way.Crispin Glover plays the title role (which was originally intended for actor Doug Hutchison). Willard is an adult working a thankless job for the heartless corporate creep, Mr. Martin (R. Lee Ermey) who acquired the business started by Willards' father. Willard puts up with a lot of crap from Mr. Martin, who takes a particular delight in reading his employee the riot act in front of the other workers. Dominated by a sickly mother (Jackie Burroughs), Willard has no friends in the world - that is, until he befriends the multitude of rats taking over the family home. He loves one rat in particular, a small white rat whom he dubs Socrates, while making enemies with Ben, a larger grey-brown rat who's something of an ominous presence.Glover is very damn good in this. Toning down some of his usual eccentricities, he instead goes for a performance of major emotional intensity. You do feel for Willard, especially when he's begging for his job. Of course, Glover is also effective at taking this character through his sharp mental decline. Ermey is absolutely delicious, in one of his better roles. Martin is the kind of guy who will buy an expensive car and flaunt it because he believes customers like seeing a businessman who's successful. Burroughs is a harridan worthy of Mrs. Bates, while Laura Elena Harring is quite appealing as the one co-worker who tries to reach out to Willard and be his friend. The rats themselves are amusing to watch; Socrates is cute and endearing and Ben does have a definite presence. The first rate animal action is supplemented by a LOT of CGI rodents.Stylishly shot by Robert McLachlan, with striking music by Shirley Walker, this directorial effort for 'X-Files' veteran Glen Morgan is basically well done.Both the original Jackson 5 version of the song "Ben" and a cover by Mr. Glover can be heard. And the image of Bruce Davison, the star of the original 1971 film adaptation, can be seen in a few key photographs / paintings.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You'd think a movie about a guy who spends most of his time talking to rats would make for a fairly uninteresting movie, and to a degree, it is. But when these rodents are running around all over the house, things do get interesting. However, the parts of the movie that truly work are when Willard is at work, and has to contend with his ill-mannered boss, played effectively by R. Lee Ermey (who played an even meaner character in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake and prequel). While Glover looks like an ideal choice to play Willard, that doesn't necessarily mean that he is. Maybe someone, say, Christopher Walken would be a better choice. Now that would be interesting! The scenes with Willard's friend and co-worker, Catherine, also work. A mixed bag.**1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Willard (2003)Just seen the remake of this movie, I thought this movie being made in early 00s would be a lot better then first movie and a lot more stuff to happen in the movie and better doneI didn't think the Willard (1971) was great movie, I thought it was decent movie , I do think that movie was much better then this remake. I need to compare to first cause I only saw that 2 days ago, so in still really Fresh in my mind. I didn't really like this remake, cause Willard bit stranger in bad, I found it a little confusing at times in the movie, I didn't really buy in connection with Rats at all. I didn't feel sorry as him as much I did feel sorry Willard 1971 movie, they did a better story in this movie, when you get to warm to Willard but in this remake it dose not happen, Felt they missing of the story in the movie. I got be fed with Willard as he set up traps after the rats did him favour, That didn't seem to make sense to me. There are some scenes I just found silly, when the Cats come in the room and runs to chair and then turn stereo on which starts playing Michael Jackson Ben songThat made me laugh so much, I found scenes very funny. Why did they mess up with the ending, first ending was so much better, This remake had me appreciate (1972) more. The acting this movie was decent but some of the scenes the acting just way of the top at times, it ends up looking really silly. 4 out of 10 Worth watching once!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting themes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't expect to be impressed by this movie. I only decided to take a look because I was bored that evening and noticed in the TV listings that this movie is billed as a suspense thriller (my favorite genre), and I found fascinating and unusual the concept of a man rallying an army of mice against his enemies.'Willard' is a very unique film that won't fail to shock, disturb and excite viewers, but the movie is most notable and interesting for the intelligent and unique way it exposes the abuse that is inherent in the social order.It's only natural that this utterly powerless man would bond so well with mice. Mice are on the bottom of the food chain, just as Willard is at the bottom of the pecking order at home where he is denied privacy and independence and is emotionally manipulated by his strange mother, and at work where he is a social outcast and the victim of constant bullying.Willard trains the mice to serve as his allies in an uprising against his oppressor. However, Willard's self-hate causes him to lash out at the creature that he most sees himself reflected in, and it is this abuse that sets into motion another uprising, this one against Willard himself.The movie is an examination of how we as humans look for one another's differences, arbitrarily deciding that some difference makes the other person or group inferior to us and makes us feel justified in mistreating them. Willard's boss decides Willard is inferior because of his social awkwardness and passive, feeble manner. The boss decides these differences justify his cruel acts toward Willard, including malicious mockery and attempts to deprive him of his nice house and a means of earning money to sustain himself. Willard engages in this same oppression, focusing on the differences between two mice, and deciding that one mouse's unique color made him born to rule while another rat's difference (he is an obese mouse) makes him undeserving of affection, incapable of achieving what the other mice could, and fit for abuse. Rather than bonding most with the mouse who didn't fit in, Willard revels in the power he only feels when he is gleefully tormenting the weaker creature, a clumsy, fat mouse.As this movie shows, everyone, including the oppressed, are oppressing others, because people seek to feel powerful by deciding others are inferior and treating them poorly, rather than empathizing with others. This movie reminded me a little of the Hitchcock movie 'Rope', which also examined individuals who declare themselves superior and then use that as a justification for inflicting mortal harm on others.'Willard' is a commentary on the human condition. Even within the trappings of civilization such as Willard's workplace, humans are behaving no differently from wild animals, devouring one another without thought or hesitation. The comparison was made when Willard's boss describes business as a "rat race" and vows to never allow himself to be devoured by competitors.All in all, I found this movie satisfying and worth watching. It's not for everyone. You'll either love it or hate it. Not everyone will have the patience to look past certain highly disturbing and disgusting scenes to see the deeper social meaning of this interesting film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Willard is similar to Ben in that they are both passed over for affection despite doing all they could for the ones they loved. Even Socrates acknowledged Ben's hunger for affection, which ultimately led to him being murdered in the storeroom rather than in the safe haven of WIllard's desk.Willard seeks revenge just as Ben seeks revenge. Willard and Ben understand that Socrates = Willard's dad, and that they were both accepting of WIllard and Ben regardless of their shortcomings. Oddly enough, all rats were living peacefully until Willard's encounter.If you see this as only a rat-revenge movie, you are missing much. Why did the director enable rats to seemingly understand English? Consider this deeply.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doctor Dolittle for horror lovers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This reworking of a long-forgotten '70s horror about a maladjusted young man who possesses an uncanny power over rats is one of the better remakes out there. That's because it has a quirky style all of its own, a kind of dark humour that reminded me best of RE-ANIMATOR, although the two films are very different. WILLARD finds the remarkable Crispin Glover playing a strange loner who spends a lot of time hanging out in his elderly mother's basement, while being browbeaten by his belligerent boss at work.For those who don't know, this film's all about rats. I'm something of a rodent lover, so I was immediately entertained by these little beasts: as animal actors go, they're excellent, and the way the filmmakers put character into a couple of the critters is very clever. Socrates is the lovable friend in many heartwarming scenes, while Ben is the creepy, imposing hulk of a rat. Watching Glover's interplay with the animals is a lot of fun ? a kind of DOCTOR DOLITTLE for the horror crowd, if you will.Unlike many modern horror films, the emphasis of WILLARD is on the plotting. Some might find the pace rather slow, but it works in the film's favour: this is a character piece more than standard schlocky fare. It goes without saying that Glover is excellent, channelling a young Jeffrey Combs and immediately getting the audience on side despite his character's quirks. He's given strong support from R. Lee Ermey (typically larger than life) and the attractive Laura Harring as a potential love interest. Writer/director Glen Morgan brought a lot of life to THE X-FILES during his time on the show, and he does the same trick here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>He is one of the few who constantly gets pigeon-holed into bad guy or extreme creeper territory, and then usually plays the part with such demented fervor that you cannot help but be impressed, and slightly perturbed. This movie, which I have not seen in almost 5 years, is one of the creepiest, most intensely disturbing movies I have ever seen, and it gets the root of the nature of loneliness. This is a very philosophical, dark film, but I highly recommend it if that is your type of thing - or if you keep an open mind. This is probably Glover's best role to date. He also does directorial work - check out his IMDb page. Note: I am reviewing this now, because even though I haven't seen it in a long time, it still sometimes comes into my head randomly - that kind of lasting impression is rare with films that I do not consider among my favorites. Take it from an amateur film buff - Willard is the real deal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Crispin Glover has never been a slouch in the acting department and has often been at his best playing oddballs and eccentrics so it's high praise indeed when I tell you that his starring role here as Willard is one of his very best.A pitch-black comedy with some horror moments, Willard is all about our titular character and how he finds himself able to direct an army of rats to do his bidding. One, in particular, becomes his friend (Socrates) while another becomes quite jealous and malicious (Ben). With a sickly mother, a bullying boss who wants nothing more than to put him out of a job and out of his home and very little to enjoy in life, Willard needs his friends more than ever.Glen Morgan wrote and directed this movie, based on the 1971 original, and does a really wonderful job of it. Seeing how the film was treated and just what was changed throughout the test screening process before the movie ultimately failed to find an audience ( all details revealed in "The Year Of The Rat", a documentary that comes as an extra feature on the DVD) is almost heartbreaking. People believed in this movie. It was made with good intentions. It was made into something GREAT. And nobody saw it.Crispin Glover gets one of his very best roles (and that's saying something when looking over that man's filmography) here, playing a young man too quiet to make a stand, overprotected by a frail mother and unable to vent his anger anywhere. R. Lee Ermey plays the bullying boss and it's the kind of performance that is perfect for the man. Laura Harring is very good in a role that may be a little bit cliché but also somehow manages to avoid complete predictability. And Jackie Burroughs is wonderful as the frail, demanding mother.Then we have the rats, each one a star in his or her own right. Ben and Socrates DO have personalities while the rest of the vermin amass into quite the formidable rodent army.I have a lot of time for Glen Morgan, his work alone and also with James Wong almost always contains a great blend of wit, intelligence and references to past glories, so perhaps I am biased but I genuinely feel that if more people just give Willard a chance they may grow to love it as I do. It's a bizarre, twisted movie that doesn't always work from start to finish but it remains far superior to many films that people have flocked to see. Oh, I also especially enjoyed the subtle nods to the original movie.</fullReview>

It also has surprisingly high production standards for a B-movie remake from the '70s, as this is (and whose original I haven't seen).

		<fullReview>Willard (2003): 4 out of 10: Crispin Glover is an insane genius. The insane part is fairly well documented elsewhere. The genius part is on full display on the Willard DVD.Unfortunately it is in a quick music video of the Michael Jackson song Ben (sung and directed by Glover himself think Cabaret mixed with soft core furrism) and not in the film in question. Speaking of extras that outshine the main event, the (77 minute!) Behind the scenes documentary Year of the Rat is one of the most informative documentaries on the movie business I have ever seen (Don't just believe me a lot of critics placed Willard in their top 10 DVD's of the year lists based solely on this doc.). The movie itself is eminently skippable however.There are two basic problems. The plot and the rats. First the rats. Not since that giant bunnies attack Dr. McCoy epic Night of the Lepus has a horror movie suffered such cute protagonists. However you feel about rats you will probably be won over by these cute and well behaved rodents (Not to mention clean. Note to Willard producers it is "you dirty rat" not "you shampooed and blow-dried rat"). With an almost complete lack of menace from our three letter furballs the movie has to rely on the plot.Willard has Norman Bates mother, works at the same office as Joe from Joe and the Volcano, has spurned the love interest of Laura Harring (fresh from Mullholland Drive and completely wasted), has the drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket as his cruel boss and developed a relationship with some rats. Willard uses rats to get revenge on boss. The end. No really that is the plot. Danny Devito's short story in Throw Momma from the train had about as much dramatic tension. One guy with white hat and one guy with black hat, gee I wonder how this will turn out.On the plus side Glover is watchable in that what the hell is he going to do next kind of way. Just wish they had let him write the movie. A soft core rat picture with Nazi's would certainly have been an interesting twist. Something Willard is defiantly lacking.</fullReview>

On one of his trips to the basement, all of a sudden he has the entire pack of rats trained to chew things and crawl in and out of his suitcases. I just thought the entire thing would have been more believable if he spent more time developing a bond with the rodents. As far as the acting goes, it was very well done. He did a wonderful job acting like a modern day Norman Bates and by the end of the movie, you really felt sorry for Willard.

This movie just shows that Hollywood is kinda running out of ideas on "thrillers". You do feel some sympathy for Willard but then you think about it and it snaps back that it's about a guy's obsession with MICE. What next, killer tissue paper? "my god....it's spreading everywhere! I'm suffocating!" Crispin Glover does a fine job in playing the main character in all fairness and the acting is neither good nor bad (seeing as it's really only one main character or 2 if you count the boss) but even that does not make up for the storyline. This film is fun to watch as a comedy if you have nothing to do on a Monday night but don't waste time renting/buying it if you're looking for a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While it may have done poorly in the box office, this stylish remake of the 1971 cult thriller was one of the first films in the horror-remake cycle.Lonely, fragile young man befriends the rats that live in his basement and discovers that they make a good tool for vengeance!As with the original Willard, it's the performance of the actor playing the title character that drives this film to be strangely compelling. Crispin Glover does such a unique, almost explosive performance as Willard that he is the real strength of this motion picture. The direction of Morgan also helps, giving this remake a much darker, almost cynical kind of feel unlike that of the original film. Also good is the weird music score by Walker and the cover of the old Michael Jackson song 'Ben' sung by Glover.The rather small cast is excellent. Although it's clearly Glover who steals this horror show, R. Lee Ermey also does a good performance as Willard's heartless boss and Jackie Burroughs as the sickly mother.Overall, Willard 2003 is a good remake that lives up to the original film fairly well. It's not recommended for the squeamish though!*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie for rat people!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie is a wonderful movie for rat people like me. Those who do not like rats will be more focused on the human characters, but there is also a lot going on with the rodent characters as well. As I watched the movie the first time, I immediately felt for Ben. The movie is said to be about Willard and his odd connection with the rats, but there seems to be a sad story behind Ben as well. I think it is evident that Ben is extremely jealous of Socrates. He wants to be loved and receive attention as well. I think it is rather rash of Willard to cast Ben aside and treat him differently. I think Willard, being so short of friends anyway, could have found it possible to love both Socrates and Ben. I feel it is Ben's jealousy that drives most of the behaviors of the colony of rats into happening.Like I said, this is a wonderful movie for rat people. Me and my pet rat, Luther, lay in bed and watch his favorite movie every Friday night (it may be a fact that rat people don't have much for social lives).</fullReview>

All i heard was, "your hungry? well we just have to wait and wait" I loved the movie! I thought it was very disturbing and Crispin Glover was excellent for the role! The best part was when "Ben" played in the background as Sully was trying to get away from all the rats, i thought it was hysterical! I saw the original one and i loved that also.

		<shortDescription>A very special and good movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently rented Willard because I'm a fan of horror movies and also really like Glen Morgan.I was expecting a scary horror movie but it didn't scare me at all (The movie might only be scary if you're afraid of rats)! Instead I got a great dark comedy that entertained me throughout these 1 1/2 hours! I wasn't disappointed, this movie was FUNNY, I laughed so much (but there are also sad moments). Crispin Glover was brilliant and so were the rats LOL. Glover did a great job portraying the relationship between Willard and Socrates, in fact you'll feel so sorry for Willard because this rat is really his only friend. This movie has a character of its own, and I was never bored while watching it. I guess you have to be into "strange" movies to like it, I enjoyed it a lot!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky little film, not horror. Could have been more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit I've never heard of Willard until I read a comment on IMDb about horror movies and this movie being one of the best recent. So I downloaded it and watch it. After that I've learned that there was an original Willard movie and a followup.The movie starts with an interesting idea, great performance by Crispin Glover, and a secondary cast full of merit. R. Lee Ermey and Jackie Burroughs bring the movie closer to the horror genre more than any of the rats, but I don't think it was properly categorized, not unless you have a pathological fear of mice. I personally thought they were cute and while the tension was a little high, they showed no gore whatsoever. More of a thriller, really.This is a good and strange movie. It is full of metaphors and little details that one enjoys discovering, but even if you miss them all, it is still an interesting movie. I wouldn't call it one of the best, though. I've seen my share of weird movies lately and maybe I am a bit desensitized :)Conclusion: I think that copying after an old movie probably spoiled the opportunity to add and change things that would have improved the quality of the script. However, since lately changes in script mean adding more gore, special effects and toilet humor, it was probably for the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took some time to understand this. I thought it was good though. Crispin Glover had this relationship with these rats, and it was unbelievable. At first when I saw the beginning I was like "Wow these people treat him horrible" but then I saw him say the phrase "Tear It" just scared me watching him praise Socrates the rat in no sorrow whatsoever. Yes, I may do the same if I had an opportunity like rats coming in my basement and befriending me but what was with Ben? The rat killed his mother and the rats attacked her. It was an eye popping wonder to see when your eating which wasn't delightful after you choke on your popcorn.This may be one strange Crispin Glover movie but I enjoyed it. It had one simple message in it, revenge is sweet. This guy made it sound simple to train a bunch of ugly looking rats to get people and their prized possessions. I would feel happy too but I mean it is Crispin Glover once again, he always plays in strange movies which in this one paid off because he literally played this weird freak, a role he was born to play which was excellent. For the people who saw this movie had to feel at least some sort of compassion for this guy though, I mean he is about forty, lives with his mom, looks like he had no girlfriend, but then can train rats in a blink of an eye was amazing. Probably the best thrill or horror I have seen. Their were some violent parts though not really though but like ones where he put a dog with the rats. You wonder what kind of guy is this? Is this someone you would want to hire to babysit your kids? Is this someone you would hire for a job? This is a movie some of us needed, Willard was a strong, horrific, rat movie with moods in the movie where we wonder what Crispin is thinking. This movie was a nine out of ten, I would have given it a ten but I found this to be a little off on some parts and a little let's say shady on some ends here but although that my overall was I enjoyed it very much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Good Remake of the Cult 1971 Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years... Willard Stiles (Crispin Glover) has been stuck on a dead end job with no friends to care for and no future. The two things he has in his life are his sick dying mother (Jackie Burroughs) and his mean spirited boss (R.Lee Ermey). Then one night, He makes an eerie discovery:He shares a Powerful Bond with Rats. Which he becomes his new friends and then he trains them for his revenge at his boss. When his boss makes a fatal mistake of killing his rat friend "Socrates". Willard decides to built a better tap trap with his rats to get his boss.Directed by Glen Morgan (Co-Screenwriter of Final Desniation &amp; The One) made a clever, funny, horror film that it shows much more style than the original 1971 film. Which is Based on a Novel by Stephen Gilbert, which the novel is titled "The Ratman's Notebook". Crispin Gloves gives a terrific performance, Which is one of his best roles. Laura Elena Harring from the Mulholland Drive fame has a disappointing underwritten supporting role as William's new friend.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (Also in Pan &amp; Scan) and an terrific Dolby Digital 5.1 EX Surround Sound. DVD has an commentary track by Writer/Director:Morgan, Producer:James Wong and Actors:Glover and Ermey (Although Ermey brief comments seems to be from a different commentary track). DVD Features includes:72 Minutes documentary of the making of the film, 18 Minute featurette on Rats, Deleted Scenes with/without commentary and more. This film did flop at the box office but it was critically well received for Glover's Performance. Watch for the Portait of actor:Bruce Davidson as William from the original 1971 film. Do not miss this clever well made film is destined to be a cult favorite. Super 35. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched Willard for the first time not to long ago. Okay I admit the thought of a bunch of rats on a movie freaked me out. When I saw the movie I fell in love with Glover, his performance is priceless, and he is so hot. The movie is not just for freaks either, despite the stereotype, I think anyone can enjoy it. To put the icing on the cake the movie featured Michael Jackson's Hit 1971 song BEN. Not only was the song appropriate it fit. All in all I say the movie was good, Crispin Glover was adorable, and the computer images were wicked. Ben creeped me out and Socrates was SO cute. This movie will leave a lasting chill down the viewers back, and a constant look over the shoulder saying "what was that?" The movie was good and I give it Six stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>weird and slightly unnerving remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS In 1971, Gilbert Ranston wrote the screenplay for a film based on his book "Ratmans Notebook". Telling the story of a man and his trained rats, the film would spawn another sequel a year later. Skip forward now to 2003 and using Ranston's original book and screenplay, Glen Morgan has written and directed a remake of the story. Dark and cleverly made, "Willard" will be best remembered not for the huge numbers of rats but for an excellent performance by Crispin Glover.Willard (Glover) is a quiet, isolated man with a sick mother (Jackie Burroughs) who works at his family's old company. Picked on daily by his boss Frank Martin (R. Lee Ermey), Willard's life is going nowhere. One day though, whilst checking the basement of his house for rats, Willard encounters white rat Socrates. As Willard begins to try to grab a new hold on his life with his little friend, the rat numbers multiply at an increasing rate as Willard begins to be tormented by a brown rat named Ben.Best known amongst non-fans for his role as Michael J Fox's father in the "Back to the Future" trilogy, Crispin Glover has had a varied and outstanding career. Often playing the more extreme characters, Glover has been at it again in this film. Playing the increasingly disturbed Willard, Glover is superb as he descends into madness.Glover is also helped by a small but effective cast of well known faces. Playing his nasty boss, R Lee Ermey is expertly cast and adds an extra feeling of evilness to the role. At the same time, Jackie Burroughs as Willard's mother and Laura Harring as his new work friend are equally upto the task of giving their characters the edge needed to keep you thinking about their motives.Ultimately the key to the film is how well the rats are shown. Combining real animals with computer generated images, the film manages to constantly balance out between the two and it's difficult to know when they are real or not.So many of us hate rats and it's not surprising that "Willard" is often put forward as being unnerving and giving people goosebumps. Always weird and often tense, the film manages to leave you worrying hours later that something might have just rubbed up against your feet. The film is not particularly scary, but it does enough to really shake the nerves and keep you on edge.Based on the original 1971 version, this well made remake of "Willard" is one of the more unnerving films of the last few years. Led by an outstanding performance by Crispin Glover, it puts you on edge very early on and for hours afterwards you find yourself on edge and worried about rats attacking you. Well worth watching, although not perhaps when it's late at night and your all alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't sink your teeth into it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a horror movie that has some weird atmospherics, but not really very much horror. The problem, as at least one other reviewer has pointed out, is that the rats really aren't scary or menacing at all. They are clean, well-behaved mice who have been trained since birth to please human beings in exchange for regular feedings. Attempts to make them look savage through dark lighting or slow-motion close-ups never work.More interesting than the movie itself is the documentary on the making of the movie that comes on the DVD. It recounts the many problems in making the film, such as finding a leading man, and doesn't sugar-coat the fact that this film was a critical and commercial failure.If you're looking for a movie where a lonely loser creatively seeks revenge on his tormentors, a much better choice would be Christine, a John Carpenter film based on a Stephen King book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Horror Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Willard is a very weird film and it has some creepy moments. Willard Stiles has had a tough life especially after his father died. But Willard has made an eerie discovery: he shares a powerful bond with the rats that dwell in his basement. After one to many problems start happening to Willard, he sends his rats out for some revenge. The plot may seem kind of a turn off but its actually a lot better then it sounds. I never saw the original, though I heard its not that bad either. What makes Willard works is Crispin Glover. He plays Willard so effectively and this was his role to play. He also looks very creepy and I wouldn't want to get on his bad side. Laura Harring plays Catherine and she does a pretty good job. The rest of the cast is also pretty good. The script is a little weak though and they could have spent a little more time working on that. They should have added more characters for Willard to get and just more in general as there were only four real main characters. The film is 100 minutes long so its not too much of a punishment to watch. Though it does drag at a few points and it takes awhile for it to get going. The pacing of the film is slow and sometimes its suspenseful and scary while other times its boring and predictable. Glen Morgan does a decent job of directing and he also directed the first Final Destination and the sequel that's coming out soon. There is really nothing new here but its still an entertaining film to watch. Willard may become a cult classic in the future as it's a horror film that's fun to watch when not taking seriously. In the end this film is right for horror fans though may be a little to weird for other people to watch. Rating 6.7/10, good horror fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that this movie really shows Crispins talents even though he is known for being a really weird actor, cause of the weird part the director gave him, but he really gets to prove himself in this movie, and the movie has a great moral, i think its sad though that nothing really turns out the way he wanted it to, the screen play is great, it seems like they did a very great job, but the one problem with this movies is that they make the rats more squeaky, i don't like that cause rats aren't really like that in real life, but its probably to make them seem more "terrifying", the Willard movie is a really great way to say that "actions speak louder than words", since Crispin/Willard becomes best friend with the rat. and the rats are great trained, they trained over 500 rats, that aught to be hard. Willard is a great and very inspiring movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>stylishly campy rat remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of the tsunami of remakes that has swept the world over the past few years, "Willard" came to multiplexes free of the usual scathing condemnation from fans who swore by the original. I am only guessing this is because the previous incarnation of this material became lost in the VHS era, and wasn't very well-received by critics during its theatrical run (I myself have not seen the film). This version of "Willard," as directed by Glen Morgan and starring the wonderfully campy Crispin Glover (as the title character who will warm the heart of many a downtrodden loser), seems to exist in an alternate reality orbiting the Tim Burton Galaxy, as the visual style often carries the effect of cartoon exaggeration; from the first frame, we know this isn't going to be 'serious' or 'important' cinema. While the film's barn-door humor doesn't always connect and some of the CGI is rather obvious (though understandably utilized), Glover's impassioned performance as Willard Stiles is an instant oddball classic, and his sparring with a winking, over-the-top R. Lee Ermey (as his 'drill sergeant' boss) is fun to watch. If you accept the premise that Glover can command an army of rats to do his bidding (it's not a stretch), there is much stylish fun to be had with "Willard."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Willard's Dark Basement (may contain spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*May Contain Spoilers*"Willard" surprised me and exceeded my expectations. I hadn't read the novel or seen the original, but was familiar with the Willard character in the same way everyone knows about "soylent green" without having seen the film, through pop culture oral tradition.I'd intended to see "Willard" in the theaters, but, for whatever reason did not. Finally, almost a year after it's release, I watch the DVD whilst home sick from work.I was suitably impressed with Crispin Glover's character arc as Willard Stiles. Willard is a shy young man ill equipped for most social situations who lives his life in the shadow of his father's death and his mother's overbearing neediness. I feared that the script would push Glover into areas of self-parody (like 2 hours of Wild at Heart's Jingle Dell). Instead I found that Glover played Willard's emotional dysfunction with sensitivity and honesty. Glover's character has an emotional kinship with Robert DeNiro's Travis Bickle. A lonely, down- trodden wastrel who explodes when his world finally collapses around him.Speaking of self-parody, I was also afraid R. Lee Ermey would pull his D.I. routine throughout the whole film, but he too made intelligent choices as an actor. Although he does chew up quite a bit of scenery, his portrayal of Frank Martin was blustery and mean, but full of conscious manipulative glee.I do feel that Laura Harring's character was lost to underdevelopment and sweeping editorial cuts to get the film a PG-13 rating and speed up a story progression that was probably best left alone.Many of you have wondered why Willard hated Ben so much. My take on it is that Ben represented the larger, horrible secrets in Willard's life that he couldn't deal with or accept. For Willard to wake up every morning and find that Ben, the grotesque manifestation of his own personal demons, had forced his way into Willard's room and perched at the foot of the bed, was just too much for Willard to take. Willard was much too sensitive to have the unsettling denizens of his own dark basement in plain sight in the cold light of day.With the deaths of his mother and Socrates, there was no more reason for Willard to maintain appearances nor to hide the rats or the savage and angry aspects of his quickly degrading psychological condition. Without the past (mother, father, family home and business) or Socrates to live for, Willard became a tool of destruction (including his own). This, if for no other reason, do I believe the filmmaker's original choice in Willard's outcome to be the most honest. Although I do like sorta happy endings and little white mice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Willard (2003)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen the original "Willard" but really want to after seeing this fantastic film. I was drawn to it by the casting of Crispin Glover in a lead studio role, and the idea of a man commanding an army of rats to do his bidding. With my expectations not so high there wasn't a chance in hell I could have been disappointed, i'm a lover of killer animal films. However I did not expect to be this impressed. Crispin Glover's performance is astounding, he really manages to capture the fragile nature of the protagonist. The film is a wonderful look at friendships with the two lead mice Ben and Socrates being two fantastic characters. Socrates is Willard's best and only friend, or so he thinks, despite being rejected by most people Willard fails to realise when a person is wanting to be his friend, thus being his downfall. Socrates is the leader of the other rats and the peace keeper between Ben and Willard. It is ironically Willard's reluctance to accept Ben that drives Ben to his 'evil' deeds. Ben is basically Willard, but has the strength to act and seek revenge. The friendship between these three characters is fantastically portrayed and executed as we feel for each of them, and want them all to get along. AT times it is amazing that we can feel that these rats are just as much people as Willard himself. Willard is a classic tragic hero, as it is his own fault that he is brought to his conclusion. The film has a few disturbing moments, such as the cat scene, played out to the surprisingly creepy song 'Ben' by Michael Jackson. R. Lee Ermey demonstrates a few more acting skills than his usual shouting bad guy, and is a great antagonist, who Willard begins to turn into. The production of the sets is brilliant, and the training of the rats is also impressive. The CGI rats are indistinguishable from the real rats. The film works as a psychological, character study more than a horror. One very moving scene involves Willard entering his dead fathers room, to toy with his possessions. The film is tragic, eerie and very emotional, which is a delightful surprise for a killer rat movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something to Sink Their Teeth In</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me this re-make of the seventies classic horror film was enjoyable, inventive, and effectively creepy. Unlike Bruce Davison, used for the portrait of this Willard's father, Crispin Glover's Willard is much creepier and strange. The film does try to explain his problems with his father's death and a mother with many issues herself. Glover's portrayal is really quite fresh, and it is the major strength of this film. He has a strangely likable quality to his depressing, ostracized character. The rest of the cast does a workmanlike job. R. Lee Ermey hams it up as Willard's boss as only R. Lee Ermey can. The film has a definite dark humour side to it, and while it is out to shock and scare, it is also trying to make you laugh at things that maybe you shouldn't. Ermey's performance was one of the things: he plays a go-getter type boss concerned with prestige and wealth. He uses that loud voice to utter all kinds of useless adages about how to be successful while affecting a short curly afro-type doo. He was most amusing! Another highlight of such humour was when the rats are stalking/attacking a cat with Michael Jackson's song Ben in the background. Where do people come up with these wonderful inspirations? The rats are very effective in the film - the big rat that does Ben is awesome in size and presence. The one other thing I really enjoyed about the film was its musical score. It set the mood of the film very deftly and was memorable. What more should you ask of a film score?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this really horror?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The question: Is this a horror movie? The answer: Not at all.I've heard/read a lot of reviews and comments on this film, and the general consensus is that Willard is a bad horror flick. I don't agree with that view. When I saw Willard, I saw a film about friendship, loneliness and betrayal. And if we judge the film by those criteria, we should see that the cast and crew did a great job.Crispin Glover was perfect as the vulnerable Stiles; his performance was stunning, truly moving. I haven't said that about any film for a long time. The relationship he built up with the only friends he could find (apart from Catherine, the love interest that never quite hit the mark) was great to watch, and the CGI Ben was one of the best graphics I have seen, far better than the 'state-of-the-art' graphics used in Spiderman. Willard's relationship with Socrates was, I must say once again, moving.The mother was great. 'From now on your name is Clark' she told her boy. No wonder his father killed himself, married to that. Sorry, her. His mother turned on him. His boss turned on him. And ultimately Ben, the other side of the main power struggle in this feature, turned against him too.So why should this have turned on the gore, and had the rats swimming in blood? It didn't have to, because that isn't what the film is about. Anyone who thinks this is a poor excuse for a horror film are missing the point, and missing out on a fantastic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not very often that you see a movie so beautifully shot. Willard's not exactly a classic, but it's defiinately something. It pays homage of the agonizingly long takes, ultra-close-up shots, and sparse dialogue of 60's horror, and does so without a lot of the sheer boredom that I always associate with those films. Every scene is shot so well, and there's a dozen little visual tricks that you'll never be able to catch without repeated viewings. It's not revolutionary, and really isn't deep or important, but I grabs you from the first moment and continues to grab you until there's nothing left to grab (forgive the utter suck of my analogy).

		<fullReview>I have never seen the 1971 version of Willard, not have I read the book, The Ratman Notebooks, but I can't imagine any of them being any better than this version, starring the amazing-as-always Crispin Glover! This movie is perfect in every aspect.It is about a lonely, sad, and extremely shy man who is teased and put down by most of the people that surround him including his mother, whom he takes care of and lives with, and his cruel, money grubbing boss. The character of Willard is so well performed by Crispin Glover that you feel as if Willard is a real person, standing right in front of you. His performance really brings Willards pain and longing right in your face with his twitches, the way he responds to anger, how he wants to say something but doesn't, and even by the way he walks.So anyway, his mother hears rats in the basement and makes Willard investigate to get rid of them. He buys a mouse trap and he finds that a little white rat is stuck to it, fighting for it's little life. Willard is about to kill it, but he just doesn't have the heart. So he cleans it up and names it Socrates. He puts Socrates back with his family, but he goes back to Willard and they form a friendship that Willard had never had....ever.Willard then realizes that the rats are pretty intelligent animals and that he can control them. He trains them and they all follow him faithfully, except for Ben, a big rat. He uses them to get revenge on the people who had made his "wasted" life a living Hell.The ending is interesting and leaves an opening for a sequel, which Crispin Glover said that he'd love to do.....so let's keep hoping!</fullReview>

Jackie Burroughs and R. Lee Ermey owe as much to the success of "Willard" as Crispin Glover. Burroughs as the immasculating, insensitive mother of Willard and Ermey as the evil, demeaning porno-net surfing boss. No wonder poor Willard flipped out and turned to the rats as his friends. No human had showed him any kind of affection or compassion, except Cathryn the temp worker. The symbolism, irony and psychology of all the characters and events are very fascinating and worth thinking about. I can't wait to buy the DVD. I give this movie a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and psychotic.....Oh yea!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Willard is the disturbing tale of a young man's struggle with himself....and thousands of RATS!!! Well, sort of. This very dark and straight-to-the-point film is about a shy loner named (you guessed it) Willard (played superbly by Crispin Glover). Willard is a lonely guy who lives at home with a dying hag of a mother. During the day, he works for a sadistic boss who takes pleasure in humiliating him in front of his coworkers. Basically, he has no friends or loved ones until the day he befriends a rat named Socrates. Soon, under the influence of Socrates, thousands of rats show up to help Willard alleviate his aggressions from his life. Things start to look up for Willard, when a giant sewer rat named Ben is introduced. That's when things get out of control.The movie is kind of slow, but well-done. Crispin Glover is great as the tortured Willard. I would like to say that he came out of nowhere, but that isn't the case. He just isn't in the mainstream Hollywood scene. Which is good, let's keep it that way. I really liked the movie, however I found it to be a bit slow. The character progression shown by Glover brings the movie life. Great flick, worth seeing, worth buying.........4.2/5.0</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, as a horror movie, Willard isn't very good. But it isn't a horror movie. Once that is understood, it is far easier to enjoy the movie. I went in not expecting it to be a horror movie at all. The main reason being that Crispin Glover doesn't really act in horror movies. He may have a creepy air about him, but it just doesn't fit his personality, in my mind. Willard is good as a psychological movie. One that involves lots of rats, but still a psychological movie. It's about a man who has been beaten down his whole life and, just as he begins to find hope in his only friend (a white rat), he is pressed too far, and snaps. Falling into depression and desperation. If you look at it that way, as a movie about Willard, and not about piles and piles of rats who eat people, it comes off as a good movie. So, if you want a horror movie, this won't please you much (unless you are really afraid of rodents), but if you approach it open-mindedly (with that Crispin Glover sort of approach), you should enjoy it.</fullReview>

It's an excellent update, and includes some scenes that are straight out of the novel (Ratman's Notebooks) from which both Willard movies is based.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WILLARD (2003) **1/2 Crispin Glover, R. Lee Ermey, Laura Elena Harring, Jackie Burroughs. Glover is perfectly cast in this fair-thee-well remake of the cult 1971 horror flick as a put-upon loner who inexplicably becomes friends with a horde of rats that prove to be a deadly force to be reckoned with and settle some personal scores along the way. Re-imagined by James Wong and Glen Morgan (who directed) the film doesn't sustain any true scares despite its computer generated vermin yet Glover makes his pathetic character reasonably sympathetic with creepy élan he usually musters in his cottage industry of off-beat introverts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Flick for a PG-13</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Willard Stiles (Crispin Glover) is a real misfit. He lives in his family's old house, wears his dead father's clothes, works a dead-end job at the company his father founded, and spends his days taking care of his decrepid mother. This tends to make getting to work on time difficult, and his boss (R. Lee Ermey) mocks and berates Willard every chance he gets. Although one of his co-workers (Laura Elena Harring) seems to feel sorry for him, he doesn't seem to be able to make friends, until he discovers a rat infestation in his basement.This really should have been billed as a black comedy rather than a horror film. Although the younger people in the audience seemed startled by some scenes, by and large the dominating reaction was laughter. This is not a bad thing; considering that it's PG-13, there's not much they could do to actually make it scary.Crispin Glover was bred for this part. In fact, I bet his parents were thinking about it before he was born.Mr. Glover: I wonder if our son will be one of those Hollywood types?Mrs. Glover: Oh, I would love to see little Willard playing a dashing hero!Mr. Glover: Hero? Heck, he'd be better in those creep-fest type movies. Maybe one about rats! He even looks like a rat!Mrs. Glover: How could you say that about our beautiful child?!Mr. Glover: You're just upset because he inheireted his looks from your side of the family...Now that I am done boring you with my pitiful attempt at humor, I will continue.The acting is uniformly good. I did have some problems with the new version of Willard Stiles, though. Near the end, he seems to teeter between having a commanding personality and a timid one, and his feelings about Ben seem to dance around too quickly. Glover, however, was great, as was Ermey. It's sort of weird to see two character actors in the lead roles like that. Laura Harring was also good - she created a character that was sympathetic without being condescending.The animals were very well trained, too. Socrates was very calm and held still when he needed to. And Ben, who clearly was some animal other than a rat (a bandicoot maybe?) almost seemed to be acting. Definetly a film worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had went in to Willard expecting to see Glover as a decent man who was simply given a bad role in life, but instead I found that his character was a social outcast because he was simply an unlikable person. You often find it hard to sympathize with some of Willard's plights in the movie, as he is an individual who cares about no one or nothing except his best friend Socrates. Still, it delivered the fun, campy ride that I had hoped for, complete with some very...vivid special effects. An 8 out of 10, this one will go in my DVD collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walking into the theater to see Willard, I reccommend you have an open mind. I myself formed no opinions of the movie beforehand, and I must admit I enjoyed it extremely. From the dark opening animation during the opening credits to the ending credits, watching Crispin Glover and his group of CGI rats prance around the screen thrilled me. The movie is quite humorous if you don't take it to seriously and extremely creepy. It is well acted, with Glover's hilarious child-like screeching when he is upset, and terrifying, with the huge mass of rats everywhere. Overall, I believe it is extremely underrated and I loved it, minus the snot dripping out of Glover's nose. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*******SPOILERS*******Alright, this movie deserves better than what it gets but I won't complain too much. Anyway, this movie is about how Willard (Crispin Glover) lives with his mother. Because of her he is late to work every day and the boss of a company his father started is always busting his balls. Willard also can not gain a social life because of his mother so most of his homelife is spent satisfying her needs. When she complains about rats or mice in the basement Willard attempts to kill them but is very unsuccessful with mousetraps. So he decides to get strips so the mice can't move so he can just kill them himself. He sets the strips up and he only comes up with one mouse, a white mouse. He feels badly for it and cares for it, because he believes it is smart. He sets it free and begins to care for the other mice as well. He names the white mouse Socrates and when he meets a giant rat the size of a rabbit he names it big Ben. Willard eventually almost gets fired and his mother is eaten by mice. His boss also tries to buy Willard's house but he refuses. Willard starts yo bring his favorite rodent, Socrates, to work and eventually brings Big Ben with him even though he hates the massive rat because it thinks it is the boss of the house. A woman discovers Socretes and the boss kills him before Willard's very eyes. Willard then goes back home wanting to die, but first he wants revenge. He gathers up all the mice and together they kill his boss (I forgot to mention he is played by R. Lee Ermey). Willard leaves the rats though because he wants them to be exterminated. The rats eventually return and there is a battle in Willard's home to the death. Eventually Willard falls into a pit ofmice but somehow escapes (?) and it shows him kill Ben through a windows by stabbing him somehow. The ending shows Willard in a sanitarium and he discovers another little white mouse who he wants to take care for as well. He tells the mouse to stay quiet and the screen went black.***THE END*** I really recommend this movie to see Crispin Glover's superb acting and the directing as well. The movie actually is kind of sad but it is funny at points as well. Anyway, just see the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...a fun dark comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout the years, we've seen a lot of campy movies including `Mars Attacks,' `Anaconda,' and `Battlefield Earth;' the latter two films actually being bad pictures, but fun to watch, nonetheless. `Willard,' a remake of a 1971 cult classic is now remade starring Crispin Glover as the title character. Glover is best known for his performance as Marty's father, George McFly, in the `Back To The Future' films. His performance in `Willard' is great. Glover is hilarious as the social misfit who lives with his elderly mother, and whose father has deceased. From watching the close-up shots of Glover's face as his eye twitches, and his cheek muscles quiver, one can't help but laugh out loud at the ridiculous nature of this man. Willard's obsession rests in his only friendship with rats that inhabit the basement of his house. One of them, a white mouse who exhibits intelligence, Willard names Socrates. Another rather large rat that he names Big Ben, is the one rodent in the breed that seems intent on destroying Willard's friendship with Socrates. As silly as this sounds, on the big screen this strange scenario works marvelously. One scene in particular was hysterical, where Willard feeds his new friends peanuts out of jar called, ?Num Nuts.' Another scene had the audience in stitches in which Willard catches what will later become his best friend, on a mouse trap adhesive paper. Willard reads on the back of the box of the trap kit that the only way to release a mouse from the paper is to use vegetable oil. As he uses the oil to free the mouse in his bathroom late at night, his aged mother knocks at the door insisting on what her son is doing. When Willard finishes freeing the mouse, and hiding it the bathroom, he doesn't wash the oil off of his hands, so when he meets his mother at the door, it appears that he has been masturbating using the oil as a lubricant. Some of the most humorous parts of the film occurred with Willard's boss, Mr. Martin, played by R. Lee Ermey, who played Sgt. Hartman in `Full Metal Jacket.' His performance in `Willard' is every bit as sarcastic and abusive as his performance in `Full Metal Jacket.' What's more, it's just as entertaining. Laura Elena Harring (`John Q') plays a small role as Willard's friend from work, Laura. However, she is vastly underused and her character isn't very well developed. Between watching Willard throw his temper tantrums and his leading his ?rat army' into battle, I just found this film to be a fun dark comedy. It's not very gross to watch, unless rats make you queasy. Unfortunately, it isn't turning out to be a box-office success of any kind, so you probably won't be able to catch it until it comes out on DVD or video later this year. As such, this may be a review to hang on to in order to remember what `Willard' is all about when it's released to video stores. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dont know who in their right mind thought that Willard was a remake of Psycho, because its not! It's a remake of the 1971 classic "Willard", which also had a 1972 sequel called "Ben", in which a young Michael Jackson sang the theme song for (which is also in the cat-chase scene of the 2003 Willard). Michael Jackson won a Golden Globe and an Academy Award nomination for his beautifully poignant song.The original "Willard" and "Ben" movies are worth seeing, their great, especially for fans of 70's dark comedies/horror films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie drudged along at a snails pace. Aside from Crispins creepy performance, this movie doesn't really offer anything that could qualify it as "must see"! Or even scary. The movie's just there. Not enough is tried with the rats. It's unclear why willard is so repressed. Yes, his father commited suicide. Yes his mom's sick. But that can't be it!! He seems so deeply disturbed just for the sake of being disturbed. Maybe if they had shown Willards fathers suicide scene in, like, a flashback or whatever, then it might have added a bit to his character. But no. We're just left to assume. Which isn't always bad in movies. Less is more. But I think this director took that a little too seriously. He hardly gives us anything!!Also, we don't really care for anyone, Willard included. For example, he shows up late everyday to work, and his boss gives him a hard time about it. Whoopee!!! I think it's reasonable for any boss to get peeved if someone is continuously late without a good excuse. And were never given a reason as to why he's late everyday. He says his mom is sick, but we see that he pays more attention to his rats than his mom. So, why is he late?? We don't know. We just know that he gets a lot of repressed anger whenever his boss yells at him about it. Does the yelling make him come in earlier?? No!! It just makes him go slash his bosses tires. Hmmm, how reasonable.The movie borderlines on parody. I'm usually a fan of cheezy, tongue-in-cheek, campy movies, but this one hardly seems like it's doing it on purpose. It's too serious at times and too self-aware to be campy.The only positive things are Crispin's performance and some of the visually dynamic shots, aside from that it's a complete waste of time.4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There may be spoilers in this comment. The original film was no big deal, and so the remake seemed to me to be unneeded rather than sacrilegious. I don't recall much about the original, and hopefully I will recall even less about the remake, assuming that I can forget about the two instances of (simulated) animal cruelty I saw before I made an early exit. I was rather upset over the initial incident where the annoying little dog is put into a satchel with the rats, but at least the dog escaped with no more than perhaps psychic scars. Possibly just compensation--you could feel that the dog "asked for it" by his constant barking, if you think that an abuse victim ever is responsible for the abuse.However, the cat scene was all I could stand. The cat in question was a friendly pet, given to Willard as a gesture of affection, and the cat was never shown to have harmed any person (or rat). Its fate, consciously brought on by Willard, caused me to forfeit any sympathy I had for Willard.I took no offense when the rats attacked the boss--he was the villain, and we are intended to feel that he got his just deserts. However, what happened to the cat would be much the same as if Willard had pulled out a gun and shot the cat (perhaps that would have been more humane, in retrospect). If you don't care what happens to Willard, you don't need to see how the film ends. And I really didn't care. So I left.I suggest that the Humane Association's seal of approval in the closing credits means very little when gratuitous simulated animal cruelty is spread throughout the film. Hypocrisy needs no seal of approval.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why this film bombed is a mystery that can only be answered by the audiences who singularly failed to go see it. From Crispin Glover's affecting performance to Glen Morgan's superlative direction, there is not a single nuance of the finished product that is not perfect, horrifying, enthralling or hilarious. Indeed frequently it is somehow all four. Its Tim Burton directing Psycho style (and with many more homages in between) makes it as fantastical as it is thrilling as it is gruesome. This is already a cult classic that is never likely to leave our midnight-movie conscience. It has many lines and moments you will long remember.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goodnight, Clark?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to see the elements of this movie that led to its Luke-warm at best public reception. As Julie Ng's wonderful making-of documentary included on the DVD explains, it quietly disappeared from theaters two weeks after its release. I can easily see people being put off by a movie about a guy who raises vast numbers of rats in his basement and then becomes a sort of lord and master of them, teaching them to follow his orders and to do things like climb into briefcases and chew up tires at his command. On the other hand, I can also see a lot of people seeing stuff like that in this movie and then being unable to look past it and see how well made and performed this film is.Crispin Glover is an incredibly impressive actor, and he fits into this role so comfortably that it is amazing to me that it took so many other actors turning the part down before it was offered to him. I think many of the other actors would have been good in the role as well, most notably Doug Hutchison, who played Percy in The Green Mile, but Crispin Glover was just outstanding. My favorite parts of the movie were the scenes at the very beginning, such as the one scene where Willard has just walked up the stairs and his sick mother calls from the other room, asking why he's up so late and what he's been doing. The camera is focused on Willard's face the entire time, and is a great example of how amazingly well Crispin Glover is able to act with his face.Willard has been living with his sick mother, caring for her and working at an office job at a company that his late father owned. He lived a very isolated life, leaving home only to go to work, where his boss is constantly trying to figure out how to get rid of him. His mother insults him with careless but deeply damaging comments like maybe he would be able to find a girl if he had a better name. In one scene she decides that maybe Clark would be a better name, so she's going to call him Clark from now on. It's not hard to see why he's a little "off." Willard's mother hears rats crawling around in the basement and is always yelling at Willard to go do something about it, so in a monumental act of rebellion he decides to feed and cultivate them rather than killing them. He escapes the dreariness and depression of his everyday life by raising these rats, which are his only real friends, and ultimately uses them to exact his revenge on the world by which he has been so abused.This, of course, is where the movie turns decisively toward cult status. I haven't seen the original Willard at the time of this writing, but this remake has certainly earned itself cult classic status, which it could never transcend but which I think it deserves to. It is very competently made, richly directed and acted, but the subject matter prevents it from being accepted by wider tastes. It's not a movie for all audiences, but is very well made within its genre.Rob Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses is another recent example of a movie that is spectacularly well made but was not accepted well by the public, probably because the majority of movie-going audiences just don't have the appetite for that kind of raw horror anymore. Rob Zombie just doesn't care, he made the kind of movie that he wanted to see, and he deserves respect for that. Similarly, Willard is a movie that believes in itself, which is certainly more than can be said of much of the empty drivel released by Hollywood these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>relatively effective remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake of `Willard' proves that, in the world of movies, one decade's cause celebre can be another's box office nonentity. The 1971 `Willard' had the kind of ingenious plotting that had everybody going to see it and talking about it. In 2003, however, the new `Willard,' with the exact same plot, took in a mere $7 million in domestic receipts and made nary a ripple in the social fabric. I guess that nowadays it takes a lot more than a screen full of swarming rats to draw people into the movie houses.Actually, despite the fact that the story lacks the shocking novelty it possessed three decades earlier, this new `Willard' is still a relatively effective chiller ? slimy, creepy and extremely well acted. Willard is a social misfit who discovers that he can communicate telepathically with the rats living in the basement of the old rundown house where he lives with his demanding, life-draining invalid mother. Eventually, Willard creates his own army of rats to wreak vengeance on the boss who so callously mistreats and belittles him. But Willard also discovers that insubordination is as much a factor in the animal kingdom as it is among humans and he soon finds himself in mortal combat with the king-sized leader of the pack whom Willard has christened `Ben.' Of all actors currently working today, Crispin Glover is the perfect choice to play Willard. Strange-looking enough already, Glover minimizes the kind of rug-chewing histrionics actors generally use when playing mentally disturbed characters, and, instead, brings a touch of humanity and pathos to the role. R. Lee Ermery is cringingly effective as Willard's boss, turning this abusive foil into a truly hissable villain. Director Glen Morgan lights the scenes very darkly, creating a world that is stark, antiseptic and faintly twisted. Thanks to computer-generated special effects, this new `Willard' can have far more rats occupying the screen at one time than could the original, though such innovation comes with a price since there are times when the shots suffer from that CGI phoniness that afflicts so many films nowadays. Still, the film gets the job done by making the skin crawl effectively from time to time. The film features a few fun `in' jokes, including using Bruce Davison, the original Willard, as this Willard's deceased father (Davison appears only in photographs), and playing Michael Jackson's `Ben' (the title song from the original `Willard' sequel) on the soundtrack in a scene in which hordes of ravenous rats devour a terrified and hapless cat. Those rats sure do have a wicked sense of irony, don't they? </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>rats are not movie stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess you could say the stars of this movie were two rats, Sorcrates and Ben. And when your movie stars rats, that leads to box office disaster, which is what happened to Willard. Also, while Crispen Glover is a good character actor, he is not a lead actor, which is another reason this movie failed. But, I do give him credit for handling live rats. Another complaint I had is I don't think the movie ever told how Willard was able to control the rats. Why did the rats listen to him? The make-up was awesome for Willard's mom, whom looked like death wormed over. Plus, his boss was good at being a jerk. But, if they were going to have the character Cathryn, why wasn't she given more to do. She was a total waste.The computer effects with the rats were fair. You could tell they were fake, but it wasn't really obvious.FINAL VERDICT: It was OK, but it moved too slow and not a lot of action. The rats should have been meaner and bit more people. So, I don't recommend it because the plot just doesn't do it for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My expectations weren't high, but still...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard, some months prior to its release, that a new version of "Willard" was in the works, I wondered who would play the title role -- Crispin Glover? Bingo! And R. Lee Ermey similarly seems a natural choice to reprise Ernest Borgnine's role as Willard's one-dimensional troll of a boss. (Bruce Davison, who played the original Willard, is a good enough sport to allow the use of his face in pictures of the new Willard's late father.)Regrettably, Elsa Lanchester's role as Willard's mom is played in a shrill, one-note fashion by whoever that was in the fright wig, making it impossible to believe that Willard loves her as much as he says he does, or indeed, that anyone could. And Willard's only unlikely sympathetic human connection, a young woman at his workplace who must be attracted to the worst losers she can find, bails on him at a critical moment, so that what starts out as unbelievable turns out to be inconsistent.The remake has decent production values, including suitably creepy atmosphere in Willard's Norman Bates-ish house, and very good rat wrangling, involving (apparently) fewer CGI scenes than I'd expected. Unfortunately, the main element of the movie that doesn't work is the title character. Willard is such a spineless schlub that one wonders what even a rat would see in him. Crispin Glover could've given the character a dark, brooding, subtle intensity that erupts in a volcanic flow of rats from the id, and that appears, at times, to be what the director had in mind. But instead, Willard snivels, blubbers, whines, pleads, and screams to the point that he quickly becomes tiresome. If "Vampire's Kiss" was Nicolas Cage's over-the-top self-parody, and "The Witches of Eastwick" was Jack Nicholson's, "Willard" does the same for Crispin Glover. But it's no fun at all; it's as much of a wet blanket as Willard himself is. We can pretend we sympathize with him, but let's face it: if we knew somebody like this in real life, we'd alternately ignore him and take advantage of him too.The movie's one apparent attempt at humor is an astoundingly wrong-headed scene involving the fate of a cat that finds itself alone in a houseful of rats. Scored (via contrivance) by the treacly title song of "Ben," the 1972 sequel to the original "Willard," the scene brings the story to a standstill, and is as embarrassingly bad as the sequel it evokes. It's one of those jaw-droppingly awful moments that make you wonder what the hell the writer and/or director was thinking. And as one who has lost three cats to various misadventures in a little over a year's time, I certainly didn't appreciate it.Worst of all, "Willard" commits the unpardonable sin of being dull. It's a tedious, unpleasant chore to watch. This is a pity, since Willard Stiles may well be the role Crispin Glover was born to play.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing Rat-Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT It's been many years since I saw the original "Willard" but I do recall it was effective at inspiring sympathy, pity, outrage, and fear. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for this Crispin Glover remake. There are many points in the story of unhappy oddball Willard Stiles whereby a good horror film could have been realized, but it all seems to fall a little flat. This is mainly in the writing department, since all the actors involved do a pretty good job, especially Glover (in a role he was born for). I was also disappointed, expecting scenes of rat-committed mayhem. One reviewer I read called this a "gory" film (a plus for me) but I saw little. And some things just didn't work, like the rat called Ben, an oversized specimen who doesn't look like a rat at all, but rather some kind of short-furred long-tailed marsupial from Australia. Also R. Lee Ermey's boss is a looney-tunes ogre and I find it unlikely an entire office of sane people would work for such a miscreant in this day and age. Glover has a desperate-creepy edge as Willard, but you never have quite the same sympathy for him as you did for Davison in the original. The scene at his mother's funeral goes from sad to revolting in a hurry when we see a snivelling Willard with a loop of snot dangling from his nose, and it was hard for me to get that image out of my head the rest of the film. In the same scene we get Willard howling at the top of his lungs at the bank's repo man, followed by a sedate handshake. All this craziness was no doubt meant to be conveyed as part of this unfortunate fellow's sad life, but it comes off more as bad writing. There are some good points. The struggle of the doomed cat ("Scully"---no doubt a nod to director-writer Morgan's years with "The X Files") as it seeks to escape from the army of rats in Willard's cavernous home, with the serenade of Michael Jackson's "Ben" on the soundtrack, was amusing. As was Willard's use of his rat soldiers to vandalize his boss's new car, and the comeuppance of an annoying little dog which almost got him caught. All in all a disappointing but not totally useless remake of a good horror film. Not to be missed is the video of the aforementioned "Ben" as sung by Glover in a weird 1920's style cabaret stage-show setting which is included on the New Line video and, I'm sure, the DVD. Glover is a famously strange and talented actor, and his sense of humor about the movie and his own persona is captured in all their glory in this video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this film ! It has this certain Tim Burton style and look, the soundtrack is very good (reminds one of Danny Elfman but was written by Shirley Walker) and using the song 'Ben' (performed by Michael Jackson and during the end credits by Crispin Glover himself) was a fine contribution to the sometimes grotesque atmosphere of the film. Don't expect a real shocker this is a psychological drama about a young man, who has no friends in his life, a mother who could easily compete with the Mum of Norman Bates (though Mrs. Stiles is not dead..yet)and is pushed around by his boss. His life concentrates on the relationship with his rats - his only friends. You could also say that the white rat Sokrates embodies his good side wether the brown / black rats embody the hate, anger and rage he's feeling. Go and see it !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, before I saw some ads for this movie on the internet, i never gave a second thought to the actor who played George McFly in Back to the future. After seeing this movie, I went straight home and bought Crispin Glovers Music CD. Crispin Glover is either a funny man who pretends to be insane, or is one of the most screwed up actors in hollywood. This makes him not only the ideal, but the perfect choice for a remake of a movie about a man whos only friends are rats. I will say that I enjoyed this movie so much it is on my top ten list. From the dark gothic atmosphere and campy production, to Glover going way over the top for acting, I will definatly be looking forward to this on dvd as it is already out of theatres in my area. kudos to Glover for taking such an awesome role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad, Bad, Bad - Did I mention THIS IS BAD!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read through the comments already posted, and I must say there's a TON of incorrect information relayed. First of all: Willard is a REMAKE of the 1971 cult classic (titled WILLARD). The ORIGINAL film was based on a novel titled Ratman's Notebooks. This film is a remake of the original film, but has nothing to do with the book. This remake also adds an element from the ORIGINAL FILM'S SEQUEL, BEN. Ben was about a boy with heart problems befriending the surviving lead rat from from the original (there were two, Socrates and Ben, Socrates was killed by Willard's boss). The boy writes a song to Ben entitled "Ben's Song," which is later reprised at the end credis of the movie as sung by Michael Jackson (not the Jackson 5, and Michael Jackson did NOT write the song - the lyrics were written by a man named Don Black and the msuci was by Walter Scharf). For some odd reason, the writer of the remake decided to add Ben's Song into the film (the original version) when a cat is being ripped apart by the rats. The song is then reprised at the end of the film, except with Crispin Glover singing it (?). The original Willard was a about an slighly introverted man who doesn't have many friends other than those of his mother whom he takes care of. His mother is ill, but doesn't look like death herself (the actress is Elsa Lanchaster, and she does a great job). In the remake, Willard now lives in a somewhat gothic mansion with his mother who looks like a corpse and Willard himself looks like hell. He's made to be shaky, easily walked on and just a wimp in general. He could easily pass as a Goth club kid with the right clothes. This is just the first in series of dissapointments throughout this horrible film calling itself a "remake." The acting is utterly terrible. Unlike Bruce Davison, Crispin Glover turns in an amateurish, squeeky performance. He's shaking the whole time and is totally unconvincing. The guy playing the boss is NOTHING compared to Ernest Borgnine's original mean-spirited portrayal of Mr. Al Martin. The rats themselves are way too CGI to be taken seriously. Okay, there were a few real ones: Socrates and Ben. Ben was turned into a huge dog-like creature (the original was a normal sized rat) with a sadistic mind of its own. They really made Ben a monster, and Socrates all cute and lovable (because he's white and the rest are gray). It's sickening. The whole thing is made to be very dark and stylized, which is no surprise because that's how all movies are nowadays anyway. It's sad that this even got made. It's a poor excuse for a film, and if anything I hope it will generate a renewed interest in the original and perhaps its sequel. I give this movie 2 out of 10 stars. It IS to be missed - skip it and see the original if you have any taste at all</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than the Previews Suggest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This dark comedy was a delight to watch, but I suspect it's one that people may pass up due to a misleading preview. The story does not revolve around an army of rats used as a tool of revenge. Rather, the story is about Willard's struggle for control of his own life; and the relationships he rejects.This movie is intentionally funny in it's sheer creepiness. Willard's mother is an outstanding character; the creepiest of "creepy mothers" in the world of movies. There are some truly crazy and uncomfortable scenes without the use of gore or shock value. It's a refreshing change of style in a genre dominated by 'slasher' type antics. Well recommended: 7.5/10</fullReview>

But i was quite disappointed with the movie, if you think about it, it has nothing to offer at all. For two hours you get to see Crispin Glover touching and talking to rats. Nothing exciting happens, i couldn't even focus on the movie for a few minutes without being bored. During the whole movie, i kept hoping for it to end because even at the beginning i knew it was going to be boring crap. Crispin Glover is able to deliver a nice creepy performance, but that's it. This movie is supposed to be a horror flick but nothing about this movie is scary, especially not the rats, which was the main thing in the movie. Anyways, i would give Willard 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i heard of the release of this movie, my first thought was to see the original first, so i could compare and contrast. But the more i thought about it, the more it seemed right to view this movie as an entity of itself. I am a big Crispin Glover fan, and i was excited at the chance to see him in something recent.So i went to see the movie. The verdict: it's simply and of itself, a masterpiece.Willard (Crispin Glover)is a lonely, sad adult, living in the shadow of his deceased father's success and ultimate demise, and constantly under the emotional strain of his still living but very sick mother.At first, when you are introduced into Willard's world, he seems a bit intense, a little over-sensitive but you still feel for the guy. The more you watch, however, you begin to see a pattern of abuse from his boss (R. Lee Ermey), who pretty much makes him feel like a total loser for just being there.When Willard comes home, one feels a sense of relief for him, he's back to his sanctuary. But his mother is overwhelmingly cruel with her offhand remarks like: Willard was such a weak name, and that she should have given him a stronger name, so he wouldn't be such a loser. So she begins to call him Clark.Willard makes a rat friend, called Socrates There is jealousy in the rat world that is Willard's basement.yada yada, i don't want to spoil it for ya. The point is:Crispin Glover's performance was heart breaking from opening credits, to end credits. And then again, as he sings a rendition of Ben, originally sung by the Jackson 5 for the sequel of the original Willard.I gave this movie a 10, which it truly deserved.</fullReview>

I have to say, it was more of a black comedy than a horror film, unless your deadly-afraid of rats.Crispin Glover was very good in this movie. He gave Willard a new, creepy look, which I loved. And the rats, the live ones and the not, they were perfect. You couldn't tell there was computers or puppets used unless you read about it on the site or not. All in all, I'd say it, although great, could have been better.(also, don't diss the movie unless you've seen it. just because it looks bad doesn't mean it is. and if you are blabing about how bad it is and you did see the movie, good for you. if you hate it so much, why are you yapping about it here? can't you do that in your own home, where others who liked the movie don't have to hear?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1971 version of Willard had at least a surface plausibility, and carefully avoided going over the top with fairly nuanced performances by Bruce Davidson in the title role and Ernest Borgnine as the mean boss. No such restraint is evident in the current version. Crispin Glover is as nuanced as a mannequin, rendering a performance that is at the same time wooden and over the top. The normally fine character actor R. Lee Emery is little more than a cartoon. Everything is so implausible and overdone in this film it was hard to keep from laughing--and many in the audience didn't even try. While the original Willard was definitely creepy, this one tries so hard to be camp it manages to be only sorry. I doubt I'll willingly go see Crisipin Glover in anything again. Yuckers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant and campy Grand Guignol</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you end up arguing the lack of subtlety and realism of the film "Willard", you've missing the point. The absurd and comic book-esque "Willard" is two things: a self-aware and clever black comedy, and a love letter to Crispin Glover.Initially, "Willard" is a story of a boy, his mother, his miserable job, and his abysmal self-esteem. The film quickly sets up a large, gray, steel and cold world looming in over our hero, Willard Stiles, whose sole purpose is to toil at his late father's company (now owned and run by the comically tyrannical Mr. Martin) and support and care for his shrill and slowly decomposing mother. In a scene where she renames her son "Clark" (because she's sure his name has doomed him to be a failure in life), she cannot help but to condescend to this tall, pale, and ungainly young man.When Willard becomes aware that there are rats in his basement, their extermination is initially just another chore. However, after finding a small white rat caught in a glue trap set on the floor of the basement, Willard quickly renegs on the idea of murdering the innocent creature, and carefully removes the rat of its trap. The albino is deemed Socrates, because of his cleverness, and Willard shares a tenderness with the animal not seen anywhere else in the film. This is the setup for the humanity in this poor mess of a man, and it's that which we are to hold onto while we watch his rather exaggerated descent into madness.The pacing quickens from this point on, and there is much humour to be found in Willard's relations with Socrates and how he becomes king of his castle (or basement), and the introduction of Ben, the monster rat who soon rivals Willard for the rule of the roost. To give away the details would take away from the tension that's built - to see this movie is to get carried away with the little world director Glen Morgan has built.The film is alternately dark and light. It's smart and funny, and not just a little grim; it's also very. It's smart, if not a little corny from time to time, and Morgan is careful to not get too ham-handed with the rat-in-a-cage symbolism. Ultimately, Crispin Glover runs the show, and the more you can enjoy his hunch, his face twitches and his satanic locks, the better.If you're looking for laughs or thrills, this will work, but bring your suspension of disbelief and a good sense of humour. In this film, one works very well with the other.</fullReview>

Other than that, they picked the perfect actor to play Willard. Crispin Glover plays the perfect psycho in Willard, Charlie's Angels, and Like Mike. The picture of Willard's father is the actor who played the original Willard. Also, Michael Jackson sang a theme song to the original Willard. You can here it in the new one when the cat jumps on the remote and at the end credits. So if you like dark comedies, I recommend that you see this movie RIGHT NOW!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest re-make in film history!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Realistically, the term "re-make" insults this masterpiece, for such it is! Superior to the original on pretty much every level, it is however the performance of Crispin Glover that elevates this film to sheer brilliance. The most astonishing release from New Line I can recall, the performance of Glover as momma's boy-gone-feral Willard Stiles is probably the characterisation of a lifetime. Whoever takes out Best Actor next year HAS to call Glover up on stage and say "Here, this is yours mate!" Up there and past Perkins' Norman Bates, John Mills' village idiot in RYANS DAUGHTER, Ralph Fiennes' recent turn in RED DRAGON, Brad Dourif's memorable exterminator in GRAVEYARD SHIFT, even Perkins' loony preacher in CRIMES OF PASSION....Glover hands in here an acting lesson Laurence Olivier could not top at his peak.An exercise more in psychological unhinging than adrenaline-fuelled horror, WILLARD (2003) still has a few chronically nasty scenes to keep the bile ducts honest. Speaking of Glover's incredible performance, Jackie Burroughs as Willard's skeletal and equally deranged Batesesque mother is not far behind her screen-son's stunning turn. Can you believe this woman is only 64?...thats another Oscar nomination should be a shoe-in for this film - Best Make-Up? Burrough's looks to have been dead for the best part of a generation already. Her incredibly flakey outburst when she overhears Willard rehearsing how he will have her institutionalised is awesome!The rats themselves...a combination of CGI and some realtime well trained little munchers are excellent. My one minor complaint, Ben persisted for me in looking like a brain-dead koala half the time, but hey, I can live with that! I'm sure everyone in the audience (and yes...most HAD seen the original judging by the fashion trends on display in the theater tonight) wanted to hear Michael Jackson's BEN and they weren't disappointed. So WHAT if it didn't come out till the (original) sequel BEN in '72? It was just the icing on the cake.One of the best films I have ever seen, despite the obvious limitations of the genre it finds itself in. If there were Oscars for BEST HORROR FILM and BEST ACTING IN A HORROR FILM then WILLARD (2003) would be at unbackable odds to take out both! Superb cinematography and production design also. Anyone pick up on how similar the Elfman-like score was to that for RE-ANIMATOR, a film of which I was frequently reminded during the screening.Absolute stunner!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake of the semi-classic 1973 about a young man who finds he has a way with rats and trains them to get his revenge. Its been ages since I saw the original, which seemed better a film to talk about rather than see. There was something about the very idea of the film being better in idea rather than to see. This remake is about the same. It's a well made film that raises the weakness of familiarity by casting Crispin Glover as Willard. Glover is a unique character who puts his own spin on things that keeps things fresh. I don't think the film is neither better nor worse then the original, its about the same on the entertainment scale. It's a fright film that works nicely because mood and character rather than because of blood and guts. Worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Willard and the army of rats</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Willard is a social misfit who lives with his ill but verbally abusive mother Henrietta in an old mansion.He goes to work to his late father's company where he is humiliated by his co-workers.His boss is Mr. Martin, who is a real SOB of a guy.He wants him out of the company as soon as it is legally possible.Willard gets sympathy from the new worker of the company, Cathryn.But Willard finds the rats of his mansion to be his only friends, especially one of them, a white rat he names Socrates.And there is also one big, mean one he calls Ben.These rats could help him get rid of Mr. Martin.Willard (2003) is directed by Glen Norgan.This is a remake of the 1971 film, where the title role was played by Bruce Davison.In this one we see Bruce in the framed picture of Willard's father.I haven't seen the original movie, but I sure would like to.It also had Ernest Borgnine as Mr. Martin.There also was a sequel to that movie called Ben made the next year.The role of Willard is brilliantly portrayed by Crispin Glover, who turned 45 ten days ago.Also 45-years old Laura Elena Harring plays Cathryn.I was kind of hoping for Willard to come to his senses and him getting romantically linked to her.The role of Willard's mother is played by now 70-year old Canadian actress Jackie Burroughs.R. Lee Ermey, 65, the man of many tough guy roles plays Mr. Martin.In the music section we hear the song Ben performed by Jackson 5 and Grispin.Willard is a very fine horror drama.It gives you the creeps when you see those rats all over Willard's mother.Really worth of checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An effective movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually saw Willard about a year ago, but only this time got around to write several lines about it. Much of this delay is due to the lack of spare time, work commitment etc. The fact that I still remember the movie and want to write something about it kinda tells me that Willard was effective. There are a few among us in our community, wherever we are, who can be identified, to a degree, with Willard's character. This chap Willard is of a disturbed mind, and his bizarre relationship with all those rodents in his basement is rather distasteful and makes for an uneasy viewing. This is the element that makes it effective, making you replay some scenes in your mind even after weeks of watching it. I am sure that there are readers here who have some problems with rats, and Willard would have made them remember this movie very vividly, even though they probably watched only 45 minutes of it. It is THAT effective!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent entry, if not overtly spectacular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Willard" is a rather decent killer rodent flick with some good parts and a couple flaws.**SPOILERS**Living with his mother, Willard Stiles, (Crispin Glover) lives for her every beck-and-call, which constantly puts him in a subservient position with her. When it forces his boss Mr. Martin, (R. Lee Ermey) to lord his power and authority over him as well, he finds that the rats his mother have been complaining about take a shine to him, and then he finds that they obey his commands as well. As he begins to get close to employee Cathryn, (Laura Elena Harring) while trying to keep his cool about the whole situation. When it finally gets too much to bear and he gets to a point where he is pushed over the edge, he takes the rats out and uses them to unleash his vengeance further, and when they start to change his behavior, those still alive make the realization about it and race to stop him before he harms himself.The Good News: There was some good parts to this one at times. One of the main things to this one is that there's some really nice amount of scenes that showcase the relationship between each other and the rats in the early going, and they're all quite fun to be able to see that they're trained to be vicious and deadly rather than just being naturally that way, a great change of pace and one that also brings up other good parts later on. It's using stuff that will actually be useful rather than just to be able to put anything up there because it looks great, and outside of some sequences that go on a little to long, they build nicely to what's coming along and it makes them feel that much more threatening. There's some fun to be had from these scenes, and it boils over into the other areas this is concerned with, including the scenes of the rats on the move conducting their revenge. Watching the rats swarm and crawl over their victims is always fun, and there's also the joy to be had from the scenes of the rats going crazy in the scene and causing untold havoc. Other scenes, from the swarming over the cat, which is an extended chase through the house over the furniture and across the room in a fun encounter to the first confrontation in the office is really good as well. The last one, at the house in the end when the rats turn the tide and go on the offensive, is also really good and has a lot to enjoy about it, from the stalking scenes to the encounter with the forces on the outside and the final comeuppance all done in great style, and it makes the film really enjoyable. These here are what work for the film.The Bad News: There really isn't a whole lot really wrong with this one. The main one here is that there's a lot of wrong-doing with it's PG-13 rating. There's not a whole lot that can be done here, and while it does have a few good scenes here and there, and it has enough to make it seem noteworthy when it does, but when it isn't that does have a few problems. The rat attacks on here are really neutered, as there's two big hints when they're showcased which give it away. The first one is that there's a flurry of quick-cutting that hides the fact that the violence is shortened or eliminated, and the mere blood pools left aren't all that spectacular compared to what they could've been. The body count is way too small to begin with, giving it very little opportunities as well but very little kills combined with a PG-13 rating really censors everything. That also manages to make the beginning of the film a little boring, especially when nothing but the confrontations within the company and at home take center stage. There's nothing all that great about it and manages to put nothing all that interesting out there. That also brings up the last flaw here, the film's rather tired feel that nothing really all too original is explained in here. This feels just like every other type of story which features these elements is showcased and is done pretty much exactly like those types of films. Very little here manages to feel new or original, and it really feels like all the other entries which use it because of that. These, though, are all that pretty much hurt this one.The Final Verdict: There's a healthy amount of flaws and good parts for this one, which end in the end make this one feeling decent. Give it a shot if you liked the original or have an interest in these kinds of films, though those who aren't really that into a film about rats should just heed caution.Rated PG-13: Violence, Language and violence against animals</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say Crispin Glover was born to play the role of Williard Stiles, a lonely disturbed man beaten down by his boss at work. His mother does not even like his name and changes it to Mark. I like the usage of Bruce Davison's role in the film as Williard's father. Poor Williard, he never had much success with women, work, or friends. So he befriends a white mice that he names Socrates and he chooses him to be his sole companion and friend. That is eerie enough. Big Ben is a huge brown rat who is jealous of Socrates' place in Williard's life. Williard uses the rats and trains them to become his weapon against his vile soul-less boss, Mr. Martin. First, he uses them to seek revenge. When Socrates is murdered, Williard uses Ben and the thousands of rat followers to seek vengeance on his killer. When Williard loses his mother, we see his loneliness in life and in death. Poor Williard, he is friendless except for his Socrates. It is amazing how the rats know how to behave in this film to be dangerous and murderous. I liked the supporting cast which includes Jacie Burroughs playing poor Mrs. Stiles and Laura Elena Harring, the only human friend Williard has at all. The ending makes us want more and a sequel could just do that. Crispin Glover rarely gets to use his acting ability in other works until now. He allows the audiences to see his potential as a lead actor and not just a supporting actor. I am giving the film a 9 score because I think they could have explored Williard's painful childhood and explain the man that he becomes in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CRISPIN GLOVER is WILLARD, a lonely young man who lives with his pest of a mother in a big house, one day Willard discovers that they have a rat problem in the basement, he wants to get rid of them at first, but suddenly he becomes attached to them &amp; soon finds that more &amp; more are making a home in his basement, but that's okay, they actually come in handy when his miserable boss gets to much for Willard to handle, Willard seeks revenge with the help of...you guessed it, the rats. WILLARD was a very good remake that I can't say is better than the 1971 version since I never seen it, though when I was small I did remember seeing BEN. WILLARD works from beginning to end, the film never gets boring &amp; has an unusual feel to it that's lacking in most horror movies today, R. LEE ERMEY is excellent as the mean boss &amp; CRISPIN GLOVER is perfection as Willard. Highly recommended to horror fans, unless you have a phobia of or can't stand the sights of rats, WILLARD is a must see! **** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its a shame Willard's release was more apologetic than celebratory, as with the right exposure and advertising this movie could have found the audience it truly deserved. Crispin Glover excels in a role he is truly born to play (If recent rumours of Glover being the new Joker in a new era of Batman is true then bring it on, baby!) making Willard both sympathetic and identifiable. I really recommend this to anyone who enjoyed another recent lost horror classic "May" starring Angela Bettis, it is similar in both feel and tone and while Willard may not match up to high expectations the deleted scenes reveal what truly could have been, come on New Line, how about a full extended directors cut? I don't really want to get into plot details as i think this movie is best watched with only the following plot points to wet your anticipation: 1. It has an army of rats. 2. Well if thats not good enough for you then go look up Citizen Kane, i mean why are you reading a review for a Crispin Glover horror movie in the first place?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>another geeky loner fantasy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i kid the geeks, cause I am one, but this movie has all the male loner power trip fantasies, getting back at your boss with the army of your choice (be it violent anarchist a la fight or in this case, rats), have the beautiful woman find you fascinating and strange and irresistibly drawn to you, the gleeful feelings of vengeance fulfilled. what this movie lacks is any motivation for the characters and a decent script. this movie reminded me not to be so hard on Return of the King, which I just watched and was feeling a little let down, but that looks like a cinematic masterpiece compared to this train wreck of a movie. i'm sorry but women like Laura Harring do not lust after weird loners who live with their mothers. Willard is badly paced and contains many stereotypes, the oppressive suffocating mother (a la Norman Bates) the overbearing, sadistic boss (kind of a cross between Nicolas Cage from Vampire's Kiss and R. Lee Irmy's sergeant Hartman) and kindly beautiful woman drawn to our bizarre hero. Speaking of which, this movie is almost worth watching just for Crispin Glover, who's acting style reminds a lot of old school Nicolas Cage, although more unhinged, if that is possible. One thing about Glover is that you never know what he's going to do, that's what's great about him.This movie however, you can pass on it unless your a Glover fan, it's not worth it. If you want a good rat horror movie, rent "Of Unknown Origin" featuring another great bizarro actor, Peter Weller. This movie is supposed to be horror, but except for the occasional rat mauling (and that only really happens once) there is almost nothing scary that happens at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great Movie, especially Crispin Glover, he is an amazing Actor. There could've been a little more killing, actually more people to kill but to me that's not that big of a deal. It would get kind of boring seeing rats bite victim after victim. I think the directors were focused on more of the actors abilities. Both Crispin and Lee Ermey are great actors and that was the reason I saw it, and they did a superb job. I saw the original Willard once when I was a kid and that was great too. I can't really compare Bruce Davidson to Crispin Glover because they're two totally different actors. Both did a great job in their own way. If Crispin wasn't in this in my opinion it wouldn't be nearly as good, actually I don't think anyone else could pull it off, well maybe Johnny Depp. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creeping, crawling revenge.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chilling and spine tingling. Willard Stiles(Crispin Glover)is a social misfit taking care of his ill and fragile mother(Jackie Burroughs)in a musty old mansion that is also home to a nation of rats. Willard finds himself constantly humiliated in front of his co-workers and eventually fired by his cruel and butt hole of a boss Mr. Martin(R. Lee Ermey). A co-worker(Laura Elena Haring)has feelings for the quirky Willard; but he quickly becomes obsessed with his friendship with a rat he names Socrates. Socrates has competition with a much larger rat named Ben; nonetheless when Socrates is killed Ben is more than willing to guide the army of basement rats to help Willard avenge himself upon his slave-driving boss. This remake of the 1971 horror classic might not be as powerful as the original, but Glover's mannerisms aid the total creepiness of this rat driven chiller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man Controls Rats While Not in Control of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie thinking is would be as dumb as a hammock of nails. Considering this predisposition, I came out moderately relieved. Strangely, most of the comments I have read have been fairly positive. Many who have seen the original enjoyed the remake. I have not seen the original, and I thought this movie was mediocre, but better than expected.The premise that a man who feels no control in his life would control rats to gain some control is kind of stupid, in my opinion. Watching the movie shows you that there is more than meets the eye. However, that bit more than what is expected still doesn't bump this movie into the 'good' category. The acting was silly, the relationship between Willard and his admirer was flat, his boss was badly written, and the unfolding of the movie was sloppy.This is one of those movies that had the potential to be good, but somewhere someone dropped the ball.If you're not doing anything else and you've seen all the movies you have on your list to see, check this one out.

		<shortDescription>remake better than original(spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure, from time to time ,we would like to sick a bus load of rats on our bitchy boss. Well, in this film, we get the pleasure of seeing nasty boss, Frank Martin( a terrifically mean R. Lee Ermey who most know as the colorful drill Sergeant in "Full Metal Jacket"),covered in a mass of flesh eating rats. The tormented employee is Willard Stiles( a tremendously fascinating performance from Crispin Glover) whose dad started the manufacturing company Frank now runs. Willard's father had died and mommy,Henrietta Stiles, had also kicked the bucket. Willard is a very disturbed and traumatized kid(his mommy wasn't exactly easy to live with)who gets hollared at with intense vigor by boss Frank. Willard befriends a white mouse he names Socrates(this mouse is quite human-like and seems to understand Willard). Willard is able to get Socrates to do his bidding. There is soon some difficulties for Willard who must contend with a VERY big jealous rat named "Big Ben." Ben seems to want attention and doesn't get the love like Socrates. The film is quite well made and shot with a unique eye and style. It has a good feel and Glover's character of Willard is compelling and nuanced. Glover seems to tap into something deeper with Willard. Willard is creepy, yet quite sad and lonely. But there is a troubled soul lurking for acceptance. The mouse, Socrates, has good scenes with Willard, and for some odd reason didn't seem uncomfortable or weird like it normally would be under the circumstances. I guess I knew that Willard was desperate for companionship..and someone(or thing considering it is a mouse)to talk to and cry with. I thought the film was quite good, but I do not dare call this a horror film. It is a character study and oddity. That is the only way I judge this film. It is ultimately a revenge film and dark journey into the life of a person with needs that haven't been met with. Ben is also a major factor in the more disturbing scenes. Ben is the villain who causes the central conflict despite the appearances of Frank seemingly the evil one. I hope more will give this film a chance and see past the oddball look. It is quite interesting to behold if given the chance. *****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Racist rat movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie 'Willard' is a remake of the original 1970's film of the same name. In this boy meets rat love story, the title character is played by the creepy Crispin Glover, but the original Willard makes a cameo in the film. Bruce Davison is shown in a painting and photographs as Willard's dead father, as a wink to those that have seen the original. POSSIBLE SPOILERS: I was frankly expecting far more rat carnage and action, and was left a little disappointed that the film didn't capitalize enough on the improved special effects to create thrills and chills. What the film delivers is a character study of a strange and pitiable character who learns he has the ability to train and control rats, with the help of his beloved white rat Socrates. The film's villain, apart from Willard's evil boss played by R. Lee Ermey(who we all want to be dead, as we did in 'Full Metal Jacket), is the big black rat called Ben. What is not clear is why Willard loves Socrates so much, but hates Ben, because Ben doesn't really want to do anything but share a little quality time with Willard too. Ben ends up turning on Willard, but only because Willard ends up acting against Ben. This film comically seems to say that big black rats can't be lovable, but little white ones are. Not to belittle racism in society, is this a racist message? If Ben was white would Willard have loved him as well?  This intriguing aspect aside, 'Willard' is not a bad film, but about as ordinary as a Rat/Boy love story revenge saga can be.</fullReview>

Taylor, Edward Horn, Gus Lynch, Laara Sadig, David Parker, Ty Olsson, D: Glen Morgan. Pale-faced mama's boy Willard takes care of his dying mother in their family manor and works at his father's manufacturing business owned by his cold boss. When Willard's self-esteem is threatened, he befriends a red-eyed white mouse, and trains his family: a swarm of over 300 rats to tear more than just tires. Even with a leisurely pace and a small plot, this touching story turned horror film has good visual style, a demented sense of humor, and an over share of grossness to make one giggle (note Burroughs feet). But nothing can top Glover's performance in which he gives a twisted amount of wit. Remake of the 1971 box-office camp film and from Stephen Gilbert's novel, Ratman's Notebook. Running Time: 105 minutes and rated PG-13 for terror/violence, some sexual content, and language. ** ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick, Stylish, Ultrafreaky Throwback</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Willard (2003) is a throwback to the kind of slick, stylish, ultrafreaky horror-comedies that were cranked out on a regular basis in the early Seventies. Flicks like the original "Willard" (1971), "The Abominable Dr. Phibes (1971)," and "Arnold" (1973), though made on small budgets, virtually reeked with both visual style and thematic sickness. And the new "Willard" fits right into that classic mold of oddness.Crispin Glover gives a balls-out bravura performance, managing to be histrionic, pathetic, pitiable, loathsome, and hilarious all at the same time. In contrast, Brad Davis, the Seventies Willard (who appears in photos as the modern Willard's dead dad) took the opposite approach, underplaying the part as much as Glover overplays it--and with equal skill. Davis' was an inward, blank slate Willard, one that allowed us to identify with the character--we kind of filled the vacuum of his mind and emotionally reacted to the other characters for him. Glover's freakazoid Willard is like an outward visualization of the emotions Davis' Willard was feeling behind his bland eyes. Both performances are valid. In fact, anything in-between the two extremes wouldn't work at all.As a film, Willard 2003 is a visually lush bit of work and not a bad bit of storytelling. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the new Willard conveys much more of the sick tone of the original novel on which both films are based ("Ratman's Notebook" by Stephen Gilbert). But two near-fatal flaws mar the overall success of the new Willard as a film. I don't want to spoil anything for those of you who haven't seen the film yet, so I'll be a bit vague here. The first major f-up is a particularly mean-spirited attempt at a hipper-than-thou sick joke involving a cat and Michael Jackson's song "Ben" (theme of the original "Willard"'s sequel, "Ben"). It's one thing for those characters in a film who deserve a nasty end to get one, it's quite another for a helpless animal to suffer for the sake of a dumb joke that's not even funny. Unnecessary and juvenile. The second error that lessens the film's quality is a particularly dumb decision to dump the original ending in favor of a blatant rip-off of Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho" (though I must say that the incredibly intense and gloriously creepy Glover almost pulls it off).</fullReview>

One of the best in history, it had all the elements that made the original a classic, and had a few good original moments of it's own. Like an opus from begining to end. Then I buy the DVD, missing it's run in theaters. This is when I see the PG-13 version, with the new ending. I felt like my hero betrayed me. A movie that was so perfect, destroyed. In the least they could have included the option of watching the R rated version along with the PG-13 on the DVD, but we only get deleted scenes, and a wonderful set of documentaries and extras. I can only marginally recommend this DVD now, but watch the original first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crispin Glover is hypnotic, the movie isn't.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** out of ****If you're a Crispin Glover fan (as odd as that may sound, I'm sure he's got plenty), there's no reason you shouldn't check out Willard, which displays the uber weirdo at his...uh...weirdest. As the titular character, Glover is quiet, sad, creepy, and pitiable. The film is mostly his show, and as such, he is what keeps our attention on screen in when relatively "little" is occurring.Willard Stiles is an outcast, he lives alone with his sickly old mother in a large house. He works for Frank Martin (R. Lee Ermey), his late father's old co-partner who's taken control of thees company. As seen in the beginning, Martin obviously hates Willard but can't fire him due to a contractual obligation. About the only person Willard gets along with is new co-worker and temp Cathryn (Laura Elena Harring), who also happens to be the most gorgeous woman in probably any fifty-mile radius.At home, Willard discovers a new friend, a white mouse he names Socrates. Simultaneously, he finds he has the ability to control all the rats in his house, except for a big one he calls Ben. As his life begins to spiral downward, Willard decides to summon the rats to his vengeful deed, which will eventually put him in deep confrontation with Ben.The trailers for the film might give the impression Willard is nothing more than a typical schlock-fest, but filmmakers Glen Morgan and James Wong are more ambitious than that (as they were with Final Destination, though they screwed up The One quite a bit). It's a character study of a lonely individual, and the film makes attempts to examine what makes him tick, and why he acts the way he does.In the end, there's no single reason that can pinpoint why Willard is an outcast, which is satisfying enough in that the filmmakers are smart enough not to suggest they can give us a true answer (unlike the guys who made that execrable pile of crap, The Cell). But not all with the film is peachy, which overall failed to live up to my expectations.The introduction of the rats is a nice touch and without them, well, probably no one would otherwise would have seen the film (let's face it, Crispin Glover needed a foil and these rodents are as good as any). For most of their screen-time, the rats are entirely visually convincing and even a bit awe-inspiring during some of the "trick" scenes. Surprisingly enough, I found myself caring for the white mouse, Socrates, and slightly creeped out by the big one, Ben.As part of the movie focuses on Willard's troubled "outdoors" life, the other concentrates on his domestic troubles, and here lies a good chunk of the film's flaws. It's not satisfying enough on either level to make this film a definite recommendation. The filmmakers make too many poor plot choices and decisions.Take, for instance, Willard's troubles with his boss, Martin (R. Lee Ermey). Initial scenes set up a good conflict, but by the end, the writers take the easy way out by making Martin into a complete scumbag (mostly by showing all he cares about is money and that he's a pervert who surfs porn on the computer) when in the beginning, he actually had pretty legitimate beefs against Willard. So when Willard acts upon his revenge, it's only partially satisfying.I also found myself dissatisfied by the lack of attention given to Harring's character. Aside from the fact she's currently one of cinema's most drop-dead gorgeous actresses, she also proved she's an incredibly talented performer in Mulholland Drive; why relegate her to two-dimensional background status? She and Glover have enough good scenes together to make me believe the movie could have mined a lot more success with more screen time on her part.I was also not taken by the film's climax (major spoilers here), which features Glover trying to escape his house, now that the rats have turned on him (after he turned on them first). The movie ends on an anti-climactic note, one that didn't cap off either its character study or creepy thriller aspects very well. But once again, if you're a fan of Glover (or you're easily creeped out by rats), Willard is worth the price of rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Willard isn't a horrible movie. It's also not a great movie but it is fun. It's not really intended to be scary, but darkly funny. Its a dark little film few people will really like because they're seeing it under the impression it will a) be lighthearted and fun or b) scare the crap out of them. Willard does neither. It sets up a creepy mood, makes you feel very sympathetic to the main character, and gain insight into the life of a guy you'd otherwise never think twice about. It's definetly worth a viewing or two, especially when you're in a dark mood or its a rainy boring day. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I return to the drive in for this movie....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, at least I made it -- after nearly a decade of missing that unique American place, the classic drive-in theater, I made it back. And for what movie -- this movie that is basically a peice of cr**. Well, that's the reason I thought it would be a fun movie to see with my buddy and burn a few and drink a few and just laugh. Well, I laughed and I thought it was a pretty fun movie, but my friend was totally bored and I did notice that a lot of people were just driving to the other screens because they were probably bored too. And, the movie started at 7:00, so please don't think they were just leaving.Well, anyway, Crispin Glover is one of my favorite character actors, I love him in "Rubin and Ed", but he was way over the top here. A little restraint would have been way more effective. I mean, you already have Lee Ermey chewing up the scenery and spitting it out again, so maybe he just thought he had to match up or something, but he should have been able to low-key it a bit. Maybe I'm missing something, because I did think that at times he was really funny, and at other times he was totally sincere and also effective at that, but all in all I think his performance was not weighted properly to sustain for the entire film's length.The effects seem cool, and there is a really amusing scene where Michael Jackson's first solo hit, "Ben" (from the sequel to the original film's soundtrack, I understand because Casey Kasem said it was so) is played over the rats having a meal on Frisky. Too many threads are left untied at the film's close (such as -- why didn't that chick ever ask Willard how her cat was? did I miss it?), but all in all I would recommend this movie to people that like movies about animals killing people. Come on, there's too many of these movies out there for it to be just me and all the other Fangoria geeks, I know a lot of people out there must love these movies!But they didn't sit down for 2003's "Willard".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Willard is great! It's an after-noon matinee kind of movie, the one that you shut off your mind to and just enjoy the weirdness of it. Willard isn't trying to make any grand statements or come off as some bloated attempt an Oscar movie or a pretentious art movie, it's just simply about rats and revenge! One of the oddest and misunderstood actors of time is Crispin Glover, and he plays his leading role perfectly. I love the fact he works mostly with rats and avoids the standard cliches of Hollywood love, and he's neither a good nor bad character. Just one who is p****d off and wants revenge! And before long this film is about his little war with the master rat, Ben, making for unusual conflicts. I can't wait to see Willard again. Crispin can obviously lead a movie, with the right kind of script and direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's worth watching if you're a Crispin Glover fan! I had never seen the original, but the plot wasn't too bad it seemed. It's not the most developed film, but it does succeed in being unsettling. Laura Elena Harring is extremely beautiful, and seems just as innocent as in Mulholland Drive. She gives a touching performance and in some of the scenes I'm sure you can relate to the ways they react to each other.I got frustrated though, for some of the reasons I got frustrated with one of Crispin's prior starring roles in Bartleby. It's hard to pick up on any character development, and the settings and occurences seem very isolated. Plus I think the movie doesn't quite know where to fit; is it (an albiet offbeat) mainstream horror film, or is it targeted at the film buffs who enjoy a challenge? I saw many very young teenagers at the theatre, which makes me think it might have been misguided, but maybe that just makes things a bit more interesting. There could have been much more room for gripping psychological trauma, but maybe Harring's appearance got my hopes up for that. Plus I haven't seen the original so maybe that wasn't really appropriate for the film.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Crispin Glover is a certifiable nutcase, or at least he plays one on TV. Any movie that he is in, I have to give at least the benefit of the doubt. Most of his films I can say without hesitation are interesting but boring, and Willard is no different. The camerawork and the cinematography were used very well, as is the pallette of colors (a lot of grays and blues). Crispin's performance was effectively twitchy and manic. The concept was at the very least interesting. So what went wrong? Now don't get me wrong...I LOVE slow films (Picnic at Hanging Rock and Repulsion are among my all time favorites), but there was something lacking in this that I just can't put my finger on. The realism factor just was not there, besides the CGI rats. Laura Harring's interest in Crispin Glover would have to rank right up there with Star Wars Episode 2's stab at romance. Willard's love for his mother just is not real. His initial and immediate hatred of Ben is not fully explained. His love of his job is left on the back burner. And did I mention...this film is sooooo sloooow. There is no excitement, no horror, no "thriller" quality, and that is how New Line is advertising it. I have a feeling that this is going to die a quick death at the box office as soon as word of mouth gets around. Which is a shame in one respect, because, if memory serves, this is the first film in wide release that Crispin Glover has a leading role in. This might have looked good on paper, but in execution, the nifty colors and camera angles just cannot make up for a film that is otherwise lacking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK for a matinee but you can wait for rental to see it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In fact it may play better on a small screen. I saw the matinee mostly driven out of nostalgia. (saw the original as a kid)Crispin Glover is a lot of fun but the way they had him portray Willard was uneven - appearing weak most of the time then strong and assertive when it suited the script, not because of character growth.The "grossest" thing in the movie was his mother, they did a magnificent job on her and the actress was a lot of fun (though very creepy) to watch.I had expected current technology to have improved and enhanced rat attack scenes but they didn't. To add insult to injury they used all the money shots in the commercials so there are no surprises.Other than that, the film is pretty much the same film from 32 years ago - and considering how audiences have become desensitized to horror over those years, I truly expected more from the rat pack attacks.The film really needed to be tightened up, could have shortened by a full 30 minutes (by my estimates) plus they do the song "Ben" twice, once in the film in a fun but gratuitous sequence (with a innocent cat) and then in the credits. Note: the viewer had no real attachment to the cat - it was literally thrown to the rats so they could do the scene and as much as I like the song, doing it once was enough.Willard gets a 4 (3 if you're over 40 and saw the original)1) Cut work / School and see it in the theater 2) Needs to be seen in the theater 3) Matinee / DVD rental 4) DVD Rental 5) DVD Rental while drunk or studying poor film making6) Don't even watch, even if on free TV</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After I saw Brotherhood of the Wolf, I thought that I had finally experienced the absolute rock-bottom of popular films. Willard, however, has proved me wrong. This film has few redeeming qualities--Crispin Glover's performance was interesting to watch (but watching marshmallow Peeps explode in the microwave is interesting too), the music was nicely reminiscent of Danny Elfman, and the titles were intriguing. Other than that, nothing. It was unpleasant without being scary, silly without being funny. Occasionally the director made some unconventional choices, but they seemed artificial and a little pretentious, especially when paired with the frenetic, over-the-top, professionally creepy Glover. I only hope that the film bombs at the box office, thereby sparing us from a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing about the movie Willard is the performance that Cripin Glover turns in. His performance is like that of Anthony Perkins in Psycho. In fact, I would go so far as to call this film Norman Bates with rats. The mood is very 50ish, yet is supposed to be set in present times. That is not what the problem is. In fact, it is kind of nice at times. The problem is the pace of the film. IT IS JUST TOO DAMN SLOW. It seems to take forever for anything to happen, and then when it does, it doesn't last. The ending, well . . . . thats something you have to decide if you like. I personally didn't. See this for Crispin Glover's performance, and for a few of the rat scenes, but otherwise, you should probally avoid it. 5/10 because of Glover's performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is There an Award for Worst Actor of the Year?(Minor Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If so, Crispin Glover is a shoo-in. What was he trying to do? The entire point with the Willard story is that of a relatively normal, if somewhat Oedipal, young man who is driven by circumstances beyond his control into becoming a homicidal maniac who uses rats to kill his enemies. Crispin Glover plays him as some misbegotten cross between Norman Bates and Eddie Munster. There is nothing whatsoever sympathetic about him. If his boss abuses him, it reminds me of Sigmund Freud's famous dictum,'It's not who fires the gun, it's who attracts the bullet.' If we don't have sympathy for his tribulations, how can the movie possibly engage our interest?Another crime against nature is what they did to Laura Elena Herring. She is a former Miss USA and on the short list of most beautiful women on the planet. She also can act, at least as much as Elizabeth Hurley. They gave her almost ghostly(but certainly ghastly) makeup. They did a Michael Jackson-type bleaching on a truly gorgeous Hispanic woman. The make-up people on this movie should have been shot. She had almost no lines. She is a putative love interest for Glover, but what precisely did she see in him?My last major criticism is that if you are going to make a movie in NYC, at least make some effort not to make it look like Canada. That's OK for a TV show like the X-Files, because it was on Fox and they throw money around like a man without arms, but not for a first-run movie. As Crow T. Robot would say,'This movie reeks with the foul stench of back bacon.' The writers should know better too. Nobody is going to do a commute from Irvington, NY to Brooklyn unless he absolutely, positively has no choice. Also, the subway does not run to Westchester. The constant rain threw me off, I wasn't sure whether they were filming in Montreal or Vancouver. But it wasn't NYC.All that being said, it was not a total loss. R. Lee Ermey gave a reasonably nuanced performance as the evil boss. I'm sure there are these third rate Kenny Boy Lays, Al Dunlaps, George Steinbrenners and Jack Welchs all over the world of closely-held corporations, loudmouthed, obnoxious, sleazy types who grab everything they can and treat everyone around them like dirt. I say third-rate because these types aren't as skilled as the Lays and Welchs but are every bit as amoral and self-righteous about it, so they don't loot a Fortune 500 corporation but settle for a small-time operation, to fit their essentially small-time nature and skill level. Ermey's cheesy little house was smaller than Kenny Boy Lay's garage.The CG was very good if repetitive. The animatronics which enabled Ben to engage in seemingly human behavior were excellent. Socrates certainly gives Mr. Jingles of Green Mile fame a run for his money as the best rodent in Hollywood.</fullReview>

Chrispin Glover wanted to make this movie interesting, but it wasn't happened. For a movie lover this is not a cinema movie, this is TV movie. Story is low, playings are average (even Robert Lee Ermey --The Drill instructor in Full Metal Jacket) If you want a drama, don't see this. If you want a horror film, don't see this. Maybe the most important fault of the film maker is to told us this is a horror film. This is not not a horror film. This is a soft thriller. But using of the sounds and music says that this a thriller. And This is the wrong number two...Finally at least, this is a only TV quality movie. Actually it is lower than.

		<fullReview>I don't often bother to write reviews on films and nearly didn't with this one; the reason being that half way I turned it off as it was one of the most pathetic attempts at a movie I have ever seen (and I have only ever done that with one other movie!), and it would be unfair to review a movie that I hadn't watched all the way through. I checked IMDb and the reviews were OK, so I turned it back on thinking that the rest of the movie was going to redeem the first hour. Unfortunately I was wrong. It is the most boring, predictable, ridiculous and pathetic movie I haver ever had the misfortune to have to sit through. I really don't see what some people saw in this movie - cult classic? You are joking....? Well, each to their own! I will, one day, wish that I could have that 100 minutes back, even if it is only to defrost the fridge! I believe that this is someones version of horror! Really? There is more horror in a nursery rhyme. The story is unbelievably poor, the acting is OTT to the point of amateur, and the best bit of the movie is the end (and I don't mean the the ending!). SAVE YOUR MONEY, WATCH SOMETHING ELSE, ANYTHING ELSE!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was excited to get my hands on a set of tickets for this movie the other day, as I had been hoping to see it. I went to the sneak preview and I must say, I'm very glad I didn't have to pay to get in to see it. At least I wasted nothing more than my time. The time set aside for plot development was incredibly boring, and the "scary" parts were simply moments that were less dull than the others. I wouldn't classify this movie as a thriller or suspense, because it was neither. There were no thrills, and the entire plot line, which could have been suspenseful, is evident from the time you see the first commercial. The theater, full at the beginning, was less than half full by the time the movie was over. Everyone else had walked out. Somehow, I don't think they missed anything. This movie would be a good way to spend a couple hours, as long as they were hours you were supposed to be sleeping.</fullReview>
