		<shortDescription>a boy's best friend is his rats.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A truly memorable 1971 thriller that has became a bit of an underground classic.Handsom, shy Willard Stiles doesn't have an ideal life. He lives with his domineering widowed mother, is bullied by his boss, and doesn't have any friends. That is, until he befriends the rats in his garden and learns that he can make them do his bidding! Highlighted by a touching and sympathetic performance from Davison, Willard is a different kind of "nature-strikes-back" film. It's a rare occasion where the human characters, rather than the animals, drive the film to its intense climax. There's plenty of twists and turns to be had, as well as a few moments of skin-crawl, especially for those who aren't fond of rodents! The movie also has a bit of a darkly humorous side to it. It's a bit of a rare movie to find these days, but seek it out and hope for a much-needed DVD release of this B movie classic.Followed by a rather dark remake in 2003*** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rodents Galore!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mousy, introverted young man befriends and teaches rats basic commands. Soon his home and life are preoccupied with this rodent infestation, coming particularly close to two rats, Ben and Socrates. Willard is played with great skill by Bruce Davison, communicating to the audience his despondency with family life as well as with his job. He has a love-hate relationship with his dotty, doting mother, played with the usual charm only Elsa Lanchester can exude. His relationship with his mother's friends is distant, and with his employer Martin, disastrous. Martin is played with relish by Ernest Borgnine, making the audience feel little sympathy for his fate. Naturally, Willard trains the rats to do "bad" things and this leads to a battle of wills between Willard and the main rat Ben(the lead character in the film's sequel BEN). Overall, the film is rather slowly paced, but well-acted and rewarding in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Made the mistake of reading the book before seeing the movie; the movie, as a consequence, couldn't possibly live up to my expectations. Nor did it. But that's not a put-down. While there were some things that irked me (the mother rat's humble "thanks" at one point, the rubber rats all too much in evidence at the birthday party, etc.), Bruce Davidson and Ernest Borgnine deliver solid performances that help keep one focused on the twisted relationships that are the core of this film. (Elsa Lanchester as Willard's mewling mother also deserves mention.) I don't know how this one would hold up today, but, back in 1971, it was a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wouldn't call it "Psycho", but it's still quite memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My mom remembers seeing "Willard" when it first came out, and so she encouraged me to see it. It tells the story of Willard Stiles (Bruce Davison), an outcast who still lives with his mother Henrietta (Elsa Lanchester). But Willard discovers that their house has some other inhabitants: rats. He quickly befriends the critters, and then turns them into a sort of army who will obey all his commands. To add to this situation, Willard and his mother believed that his father died naturally, but it begins to look like Willard's boss Al Martin (Ernest Borgnine) may have been involved.The old, dark house, and the young man living with his mother might bring to mind "Psycho", but "Willard" seems to me to be more of a story of an outcast taking revenge on the world that rejected him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie scared the pants off me as a kid - literally! Now I like rat movies as much as the next guy, but this one was CREEEEEPY! I suppose it was Ernest Borgnine's performance as Mr. Martin, Willard's boss, that made the whole movie so disturbing. It's so creepy because it's true! I once had a boss who reminded me of Ernest Borgnine, but fortunately I never tried to bring my pet rat to work with me! Anyway, here's my advice - if you like rat movies, or movies with Ernest Borgnine, then see "Willard" tonight. If you DON'T like Ernest Borgnine and you DON'T like rat movies, then maybe "Willard" is not for you. I don't want to give any more of the plot away, but IF you do decide to watch "Willard", make sure you don't see it alone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Spoiler~ Before viewing the remake, I decided to take a look at the lost original. Willard is an unusual piece of horror from the early 70's. It portrays an interesting character study of Willard Stiles, a Momma's boy who seemingly can't even think for himself. As far as that goes, I think it's a brilliant film. Bruce Davison is fascinating in this role. His character actually grows during the course of the movie and he portrays Willard very well. Ernest Borgnine is at his usual best as well. He plays the villain, and he's good, I just find him too damn likable. Then again, I have never been more p*ssed in my life at someone killing a rat. My only problem with Willard is that it hasn't aged real well. It's unmistakably a film from the 70's and I think that takes away from it a little bit. The thing that surprised me the most was the low body count. This film is more about a young man coming out of his shell than it is about killer rats. That doesn't make it a bad movie, there's just not too much horror in it. I happened to really enjoy it and I'm looking forward to the remake as well. The ending may have been anti-climatic, but it was fitting. You don't turn your back on your friends, even if they are killer rats. Younger audiences will crave more bloodshed but the core story is still very solid and worth watching. Willard could certainly use a DVD transfer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A kind of...Psycho meets Frankenstein....with rats!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film when I was eight years old. My older brothers wanted to see this film so bad and my parents said, "take your little sister". With protest, they took their little sister and this is a neat horror film I remember.I haven't seen it in decades but when I heard they were "re-making it" I thought I'd write about this one first. My brothers had a bet that when I got older, I'D be the one re-making this film, I couldn't stop talking through it about how I'd change this..and..or...that.I liked this film. I remembered a very young Bruce Davidson playing Willard who had no real friends, very introverted, just a few rats, and a crappy job. Ernest Borgnine was his fat sloppy boss and a crappy fat sloppy boss he was with a tramp-floosy of a secretary that got everything whereas poor Willard got pushed around and ridiculed.But when Borgnine wanted Willard's house, Willard struck back with his rats. Rats he trained and were smart as a whip. Especially the rat "Ben". My favorite line for the rest of my life? "Tear him up!!!"It was a great story and it reminded me of a "Psycho" meets "Frankenstein", the monster created being the TWO rats. A good story, lotsa, lotsa rats (before CGI). I can remember Bruce Davisdon speaking about it on a show once in the 70's since the film became surpisingly popular for that time, he said they were REAL rats and the "rat wranglers" had to smear peanut butter wherever they wanted the rats to chew!A ground breaker for its time, a must see before you see the new one if for nothing, nostalgia's sake of the 70's.Good entertainment. Rent it today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was about 7, my father dropped me and my brother off at the theater to see Willard. He didn't come in with us because the movie had the well-deserved reputation for being disgusting. He told us that he was dropping us off to teach us a lesson--NEVER ask to see disgusting movies AGAIN!! Unfortunately, my brother and I loved it--and not just the gore (which is very mild by today's standards) but because the story and acting were good.Bruce Davison carried the role of Willard quite well, though particularly exciting to watch was Ernest Borgnine as the nasty jerk of a boss. Seeing him become rat food 2/3 of the way through the movie felt VERY satisfying.In addition, I appreciate how the writers helped us to have some empathy for Willard and he was NOT portrayed as some psycho--he really felt torn by his nasty exploits.So, I would recommend this film to guys. Period. Women just don't seem to have much appreciation for armies of flesh eating rats. Go figure.SUPER IMPORTANT NOTE: There was a sequel (of sorts) for this movie. BEN stars the lead rat on further adventures. However, instead of devouring people, he meets a talentless child and becomes his "special friend". I'm getting ill just thinking about it. AVOID THE SEQUEL AT ALL COSTS! Don't say I didn't warn you!This is VERY reminiscent of problem with the original Village of the Damned. It was a great movie in which evil children terrorized a small town, but in the sequel (?) Children of the Damned, the kids just want to be loved and understood. Oooooooo, the PAIN is INTENSE just thinking about that movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy, weird</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A little flick that blends elements of psycho-drama and animals-run-amuck, along with a hint of old-dark-house. Willard is a socially-maladjusted young man who lives in a gloomy, Victorian house with his co-dependant mother. Their relationship constitutes the weird part of the movie, nudge, nudge. Willard is tolerantly allowed employment at his late father's business, presided over by passive-agressive Ernest Borgnine. With no social life and no friends, Willard resorts to training rats with above-average intelligence. Of course, things take a dark turn when Willard's mother dies and Borgnine's bully tendencies come to the fore, prompting the put-upon Willard to use his rodent buddies to even the score. Also on hand is Sondra Locke as caring co-worker who tries to enter into Willard's world and may be his means of salvation. You find yourself rooting for her to win out. Spawned a more (in)famous sequel, BEN, remembered primarily for it's theme song, which provided Michael Jackson with one of his first solo hits. Very appropriate, in hindsight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do not bother with the Crispin Glover remake, this is the real Willard. Not as scary as it is just fun. Similar to "Stanley" which came out around the same time, where an alienated Vietnam veteran uses pet rattlesnakes to kill his enemies, only Willard has a better script and much better acting. Brice Davidson is excellent as a troubled young man who finds friendship in an army of rats. Ernest Borgnine is great as the evil boss, and a young Sondra Locke shines as the nice girl who would steal Willard's heart, if not for a rat named Socrates. As low budget thrillers go, Willard is one of the more enjoyable. Kinda creepy, a little tongue in cheek, and even a little sad. If you haven't already seen it, I really think you should. Then go into the basement alone with the lights off and make some new friend... =)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different From What I Expected And That's No Bad Thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film whose sequel is better known . BEN is remembered by people of a certain age after being broadcast one night and everyone discussing it in class . Rats were a mainstay of horror helped no doubt by the notorious British horror writer James Herbert whose novels were a massive favourite of British schoolboys in the 1980s . WILLARD is a film I had no knowledge and as far as I know had never been shown on British network television or if it had no one I knew had ever seen it and I only knew of its existence by looking up BEN on IMDb to find that fondly remembered film was a sequel to this one . I also managed to confuse the name Bruce Davison with Bruce Dern and had visions of a bitter and twisted misanthrope plotting cruel revenge against a world who has rejected him . This as it transpires in not how WILLARD pans out There's a strange tone to this film . While up and coming film makers like George A Romero and Wes Craven were pushing the boat out as to what they could get away with WILLARD looks and feels exactly like a film that treats the Hats code as the word of God which was no longer in effect during its production . In fact much of it feels like it might be a romantic comedy or a Walt Disney film as a socially inept put upon young man trying to find some sort of target in life as destiny conspires against him Davison occasionally over plays the eponymous title character , but you do feel genuine pity for him as he returns home from work on his 27th birthday and the guests of the party are all friends of his infirm mother . He has no social life and his life revolves around work where he is bullied by his heartless boss played expertly by Ernest Borgnine . As some people have picked up on - it's too obvious not to notice to be honest - WILLARD spends most of its running time as a character driven drama with an element of black comedy and even when it does throw its hand in and becomes an out and out horror revenge drama it's quite bloodless . Some people might think this a completely bland film for that very reason but it makes a nice change even in a film from 40 years ago where character is to the fore instead of gore</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Didn't see a review with that title. Seemed like one was in order for this entertaining, original, exceptionally unique little flick. The script, acting, character development etc - all elements come together in delightful way. The Ernest Borgnine role, brilliantly conceived and executed (ahem). A great performance by Sondra Locke too, before she became more famous (Clint Eastwood movies, if I recall). Perfect casting, all around. Superb viewing, highly recommended for discriminating tastes in vintage exploitation cinema. No comparisons apply for this monumental, one-of-a-kind landmark movie. Ten stars in every department, a lot of bang for low-budget production buck.</fullReview>

I was not sure what I expected from this movie but I did not expected it to be a slow as it was. This is very slow moving movie, for most of the movie we see Willard who just turned 27 year old, Having one of those bad day,s seem to get worse as weeks go on, He got no Friends and He boss bullies him and never raisers and He mum is fallen sick and calling help , when he get home and soon passes , leaving not money and then ends up loses the house The only spare time he get he hanger out new little Friends in Garden, I did expect Horror movie but This is not Horror movie at all, Nothinkg was scary or creepy or was that gory or Bloody either.With all these nasty stuff happening and get closer to rat he really start to lose in mind in some scene. I was really gutted that there was only one attack scenes in this movie, it was over a little to quick.The acting was really good from the whole cast 5 out of 10 EDIT, I give 7 out of 10 now</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing Willard as a kid - enjoyed the film then. Watching it all these years later I still find it a good film.It seems that Willard is a 27 year old man without many real friends. He stayed with his sick mother &amp; his father passed away leaving the business to a colleague and Willard works for the man - this man wants Willard out of the office. After Willard's mother passes away there is a large mortgage left on the house and Willard's boss wants it as well. When at home, Willard spends most of his time with the rats he's raised and the two rats he's closest to are Ben and Socrates. Willard brings his rats to work with him, they get loose and his boss kills Socrates - that's when Willard becomes vengeful and Ben is willing to help.This is a pretty good character &amp; story driven film. Worth watching if you like the older horror films.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low-rent character piece/thriller is bolstered by talent on and off the screen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nervous young lad, living in a dilapidated Los Angeles manor with his nagging mother, befriends the rat population in his backyard, which comes in handy when he needs help committing a robbery or scaring off his enemies. Daniel Mann, the director of "The Rose Tattoo" and "I'll Cry Tomorrow," couldn't have been very happy about directing this venture, yet the low-budget picture grossed over $19 million at the box-office (a huge haul in 1971). It's an unpretentious exercise in masochism, though Mann does attempt to bring out the character drama in Gilbert Ralston's screenplay--and nearly succeeds. Bruce Davison works hard at carving out an original, eccentric creation in our anti-hero, and the tone of the film is surprisingly jaunty, not ugly or excessively downbeat. The film moves at a brisk pace, but doesn't leave the viewer with much to think over at the end. It's a mindless venture designed to give a squeamish audience a few visual jabs, but nothing extra. Followed in 1973 by "Ben". ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hard to say which is better--the original or the remake. Both films have their merits, although Crispin Glover may have brought more humor to the role of Willard than Bruce Davison. The look of the original actually belies the 1971 release date, looking more like it was made circa 1969, judging by the fashions/hairstyles. This is understandable, since it can sometimes take a few years for a film to be released after its completion. But the film itself? It really is hard to say which is better; the original or the remake. The original has the retro appeal, but the remake is much more visually interesting than the original. Best to watch both and then decide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what you expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're expecting this to be a horror film, you'll be disappointed. Yes, it does have its scary moments, but plays better as a psychological drama than straight horror. The pace is glacial, but the performances are top-notch, particularly Ernest Borgnine as the man you'll love to hate, and a young Bruce Davison, already showing signs of his creative brilliance.It should go without saying that the atrocious Irwin Allen wannabe "rat disaster" sequel "Ben" is to be avoided--"A Boy and his Rat" indeed!--but I'm not so emphatic on the 2003 remake of Willard. Any film pairing the already creepy Crispin Hellion Glover and R. Lee Ermey has something going for it. Glover doesn't have anywhere near the range of Davison, but Ermey is at least as intense as Borgnine, though without the greasy sneer that made Al Martin so unpleasant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acting Saves the Day!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was a huge hit in the summer of 1971,mostly through a smart, savvy advertising campaign that played up the horrific elements of the film. I will admit that as a young man I enjoyed the film, but seeing it today I find it deeply flawed. In the hands of a Brian DePalma or John Carpenter this could have been great stuff-Daniel Manns'direction is so pedestrian that it dulls the senses; there is no sense of atmosphere at all. Another minus is, the usually reliable, Alex Norths' musical score is terrible! Luckily the actors come through with flying colors. The cast is composed of some old time character actors,(J.Pat O'Malley etc.), colorful veterans (Elsa Lanchester,Ernest Borgnine) and 2 terrific newcomers(Sondra Locke and Bruce Davison). The cast saves this movie. Borgnine can always be counted on to deliver a good performance and he delivers here. Sondra Locke is very good as Williards' lone friend (aside from the rats) and Bruce Davison is terrific as Willard. He has all the nervous tics of Anthony Perkins in "Pyscho" and yet has a strange, almost likable air about him the earns our symphathy-a great performance that, in my opinion, saves the film. The story is about how Willard, a frustrated, immature, mother dominated young man, comes to find a meaning in his life caring for the rats that infest his old broken down home. Naturally the rat multiply and Willard soon finds himself leading an army of the critters, that do his bidding. At first its' small mischief(ruining the bosses party) and then later much more malignant deeds. The whole story leads where you expect it to but its fun watching Davisons' character grow as the film goes on. On the whole you can do worse with your time, but watch "Willard" just for a terrific debut performance by a fine actor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bruce Davison as Willard Stiles was a perfect pick of someone in need of a friend. His mother and her friends didn't think much of Willard. His boss, Al Martin played by Ernest Borgnine thought even less, of poor Willard. The boy in his late twenties had no one to be a friend. One day he throws part of his birthday cake at a rat in the back yard. Soon after, more and more rats come for a meal with Willard. He develops a friendship with a white rat, Socrates. They become like-minded. But two others try to become friends with Willard, for reasons beyond understanding. Joan, a part time worker with Willard sees Willard as a man whom she begins to like. And there is Ben, a dark furry little rat but one that has his own mind. The mother of Willard dies and leaves the house which has become a "rat haven" to Willard but not enough money for the tax man. Al Martin does his best to take away the house from the Willard. Then Al does something which will shake the events in his life and Willard's best friend Socrates. Can a rat desire revenge? Can Willard control the free thinking Ben? Will the tax man take the house? Will Joan win the affections of Willard more than a rat? These questions make the rest of the film, interesting, but with a twist of sadness at the end. But is it sadness or justice, only you can decide that!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Willard (Bruce Davison) is a lonely neurotic whose main companions are his mother and old ladies. Things are going bad at work as his boss Al Martin (Ernest Borgnine, an excellent choice) keeps putting him down and screwing him. He finds his only friends come not in human form, or even anything resembling palatable animal form... ****************Possible Spoiler**************As misdeed after misdeed builds up loathing in an audience it is enjoyable for the viewers to see the antagonist get it. However, sometimes satisfaction is truncated when the antagonist's demise or comeuppance is brief or of little intensity or, in a situation in which significant violence has been inflicted, relatively nonviolent, as the people who get it are only henchmen. At other times, visceral satisfaction is realized fully (e.g., Chuck Norris applying a variety, to put it mildly, of martial arts moves to the Arab terrorist in "Delta Force"). Here, one of the great satisfaction scenes is of Martin getting torn up by the rats. He is a consummate creep, and the cowering he displays when confronted by Willard and his rodents is very memorable and my favorite scene of this nature. Willard, you and I are friends, I meant nothing wrong, etc. Arrogance and malice and smerks turn into begging for mercy. Great scene, and no humane death method!</fullReview>

Lee Hermey is not chopped liver either particularly when he delivers his famous line about Mickey Mouse .The first version lacks humor (present in the remake ,the scene of the computer -and the mouse- when the villain watches dirty pictures is hilarious ),and is marred by bland sentimental scenes .Actually the nightmare begins when the film ends.The rest could be an average episode from an average sitcom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fondly Remembered - Flawed in Hindsight - But Bruce R-O-C-K-S!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wildly concur with Lambiepie-2 - my L.A. horror-home-girl for life - that the command "Tear 'em up" immediately sailed into the lexicon of my favorite film lines after seeing "Willard." This flick is one of several from the early '70s that I defiantly cling to for all the thrills and laughs it gave me as a kid. I even shed a tear at the grisly demise of Socrates. I didn't see "Willard" in its original 1971 release. I was only 6 then. I caught it a few years later as part of some GP-rated double feature. Watching "Willard" decades later on a prized $35 LASER DISC, I cringed at its hokey made-for-TV pacing. However, I became a Bruce Davison fan for life because of "Willard," faithfully following him through a maze of impressively eclectic performances - from "Short Eyes" to "Longtime Companion." His gifts were so wasted in "X-Men." I, too, remember Mr. Davison paying moon-tanned "Elvira" a visit on her horror-snicker-flickers show one Saturday night to reminisce about sharing screen time with vermin - that would be the rats AND Ernest Borgnine. In all fairness, mad props are due to ol' Ernie for inhabiting the asshole you love to hate as Stanley Willard's lecherous and conniving boss.Much as I loved Crispin Glover in "River's Edge" (a haunting and disturbing film about teens finding a dead girl in the woods which also starred the luscious Ione Skye and a demented Dennis Hopper as a character named "Feck"), I could tell from the tone of the "Willard" remake's trailer alone that I would have zip-zero interest in sitting through it. I imagine Crispin was over-the-top and that the CGI-enhanced flesh eating rodents chewed up more than their fair share of the scenery AND the extras. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for splatter, menace and entrails ("The Toolbox Murders," "Don't Answer the Phone" or "The Last House on The Left," anyone), but there was a creepy, era-specific charm to the original "Willard." Bruce Davison left an indelible and unshakable impression in this - a remarkable role for his first as the title lead.Now, where can I find a copy of "The Ratman's Notebooks" to keep me up at night in the new year?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as it should have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The book this movie is based on, "The Ratman's Notebooks," is so much better that this film has become over the past thirty years really insignificant. At least it has good performances, but the general Made-for-TV feel of the picture ruins it. Now I understand they're doing a remake. For God's sake, just follow the original book. It was damn good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow Moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS Willard is a very slow moving character study. It is not, as it is billed, a horror film, unless you have a phobia relating to rats. Yes, scenes with the rats can deliver a gross out, but that's about it. The only really horrifying thing in the film is the way the rest of the cast (excluding Sondra Locke's character) treat Willard. Basically what we have here is the story of a shy man, suppressed by his overbearing mother and without his father who is put upon by everyone. He withdraws so much that his only friends are rats. At various points in the movie he uses the rats to ruin his bosses party, steal money, and finally murder his boss. All of the acting is good, and Borgnine is excellent as Willard's creepy boss. But this can't save the film from its glacier pacing and inappropriate music. Ultimately the film is a let down because nothing really happens. I do not recommend this film unless you really like slow paced character sketches or are afraid of rats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome for a horror movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie on network television a couple some years ago (don't remember exactly) I watched it because I was bored. It's about a social misfit named Willard who's a pariah at his workplace as well as his community. His boss didn't even have respect for him. Then Willard starts collecting rats as pets, who eventually get into trouble and breed.The acting was excellent, the characters and plot were good, too. Even though the rats were supposed to be ferocious, I found them to be cute. And another cool thing about this is that he tried to tame his pets, but failed in the process. He even brought them to work with him, at first secretly, so they could attack his co-workers. The best part was when the rats tried to attack his egomaniacal boss.In conclusion, this was an excellent horror movie involving animals. It wasn't a candy-coated type of horror flick, but it's really worth checking out! I give it 4 out of 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give me back my wasted time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard they were remaking this movie for 2003. As I'd never seen the original, I wanted to be able to compare the two. All I can say for Willard (1971) is this: "How can something this drawn out and anti-climactic be considered Horror?" The worst parts of this movie were scenes showing a disturbing level of animal cruelty. As for horror, there wasn't any. The rat attacks were laughable. These must have been super rats as they flew through the air (clearly thrown) to get to the shoulders and neck of their victim. Most of the time there was a whole lot of nothing going on involving overly affectionate elderly people, chauvinistic jerks, and one milquetoast Norman Bates wanna-be. You end up just wishing for everyone in the movie to die (including the writers, editors, and the director). I've seen previews of Willard (2003). Fortunately it already looks like a much better film. Don't waste your curiosity on the original unless you like being bored to tears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See this -NOT the remake!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen the remake at a pre-screening, just let me say: the original is the best! The remake seriously sucks. It doesn't have any of the depth of character the original has. However, don't be expecting a remake of Ben - after that ending, there's no possibility. Seek out the original Willard and you shall be rewarded!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ah Rats!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSAh rats! No wait. That is the whole plot in 2 words.From "Marty" to Martin. My how Ernest Borgnine, fell from grace.How many of you knew, that Willard is the first name of Republican Presidential nominee, Willard Mitt Romney? Okay whoever named this kid is thankfully out of the gene pool. Who the hell names their kid after a baseball glove? What's next? A boy named shuffleboard?Okay anyway - the famous tag-line: "Where dreams end...Willard begins." That may apply to our poor baseball glove. No I could not begin to tell you how devastatingly challenged the contact lens acting, plot, dialogue, and scenery are. Nor could I tell you how dreadful the music is. While this is NOT as bad as Manos: The Hands of Fate, I am not too sure I'd ever watch this quality challenged cinematic blunder again. It is NOT even good fodder for Mystery Science Theatre.I think Alan Alda's quote: "There certainly is NO lack of slowness" sums it perfectly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good (Rat), The Bad (Rat) and the Nerd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's quite a few horror movies dealing with killer rats, but the story of good old Willard Stiles (based on the novel Ratman's Notebooks by Gilbert Ralston) is still very unique, because it mainly revolves on the communicative link between the vicious rodents and a human being. This is actually a predecessor to all the films centering on (young) people that use special powers to extract vengeance on all those that have wronged them, like "Jennifer", "Stanley" and even Stephen King/Brian De Palma's "Carrie". Hmm, how strange I only just notice now how all these film have the protagonists' names as a title. Anyway, the titular character here is an extremely introvert, nerdy and oppressed 27-year-old guy whose life is truly worthless. His domineering mother invites her own friends to Willard's birthday parties (also because he hasn't got any), he has an inferior job in the factory his own father founded and the boss Mr. Martin treats him like a slave. The only person in the world who respects Willard is his temp secretary, but he doesn't even notice that himself. Willard finally finds some happiness in life when he befriends a handful of rats in his backyard. As the number of rats rapidly increases, Willard learns how to correspond with them and even succeeds in controlling their actions. He keeps his two favorite rodents (a white one called Socrates and a big fat mean-spirited black one called Ben) with him at all times and uses the hundreds of others as a personal army of retribution. "Willard" is not a scary or gory film, but it does feature some admirably atmospheric sequences, dark &amp; grim set pieces and a masterfully tense climax. The hectically crawling rats are eerie to behold, but still the film primarily relies on good old-fashioned human acting performances. Bruce Davison, Elsa Lanchester and Sandra Locke are great but it is ? as always ? Ernest Borgnine who steals the show. His character Mr. Martin is a sleazy, corrupt, greedy and preposterous SOB you simply love to hate. Borgnine depicted quite a few memorably villainous types in his long &amp; terrific career (like the satanic cult-leader in "The Devil's Rain" and the uncanny Amish patriarch in "Deadly Blessing") and Mr. Martin definitely ranks high on top, too! In 2003, "Willard" received the widely feared remake treatment, but against all odd the new version, starring cult favorite Crispin Glover as Willard and R. Lee Ermey as Mr. Martin, turned out to be a genuine winner. There's also a direct sequel called "Ben", which is actually more of a spin-off with the evil rat as the anti-hero, but that film was too Disney for my likings and only worth seeing because a young Michael Jackson sung the title song.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Willard gets ratty with horrifying results!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no shortage of films about young people who get angry and take revenge via some unethical means - Carrie, Evilspeak, Kiss of the Tarantula...the list goes on. But what makes Willard stand out from the rest of the crowd? Well, the answer to that has to be 'nothing really', though the film did come out before a lot of the similar films so I guess it deserves some credit for that fact. Willard is a fairly creepy little affair which features a handful of the 'classic' horror elements, those being rats, a creepy kid, a lonely old house etc and while the story comes together fairly well, Willard's main problem is that it's just not interesting enough. The plot focuses on Willard; a troubled young man who lives alone with his mother after the death of his father some years earlier. He's put under pressure by his mother his boss, who wants to force him out of the company because he wants Willard's house. Willard's only friends (aside from the girl at work) are his two pet rats, Ben and Socrates, but after a tragedy at work; Willard decides that enough is enough...The title character is played by Bruce Davison, who if you ask me isn't really creepy enough. The whole rats thing adds to his creepiness, but on the face of it he looks like your average kid, and personally I think the film would have worked better with someone a bit more foreboding in the lead role. Davison gets excellent support from Ernest Borgnine as his unsympathetic boss, and Borgnine manages to steal the show every time he appears on screen. The plot does move rather slowly, however, and the film cant really described as a thriller. The whole thing about Willard and his rats doesn't come through well either; we see him holding them, stroking them and talking to them but there's never really too much of a bond formed and the film constantly feels like it can't portray what it is that it wants to portray. There is something enjoyable about Willard though, the way it plods along means that it's easy to get into and it never became boring enough to make me want to reach for the remote. I have to say that the ending was a bit of disappointment, but you could do worse than this film I suppose.</fullReview>
