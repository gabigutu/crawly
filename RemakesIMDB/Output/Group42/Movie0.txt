		<shortDescription>To those who "don't understand"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't blame those who state that they do not "understand" the superlatives surrounding Jean-Luc Godard's 1960 masterpiece, Breathless. It's primarily because to appreciate Breathless, one has to view the movie from a historical context, which also requires studying of not only the French New Wave, but film theories as a whole, and the lives of those apart of the New Wave. Breathless accomplished many things unprecedented prior (many completely unprecedented, but some things are not-so-much).Roger Ebert put it best when he said that just as film fanatics may now stand outside a movie theatre waiting for the next Quentin Tarantino movie to be released, film enthusiasts were doing so for Godard in the 1960s. He was a revolutionary, which is why MovieMaker magazine called him the 4th most influential director of ALL-TIME (only behind Welles, Griffith, and Hitchcock)! What did Godard do different? Breathless is all style, simple as that. The story line is interesting, yes, but is Godard's aesthetics, production modes, subject matters, and storytelling methods that are key. First of all, the whole movie was shot on a hand-held camera, just like most all New Wave pictures. It was, however, only shot by two people (Godard and his cinematographer, Rouald) on a budget that did not top $50,000, a mere fraction of what most pictures cost at the time (another facet of the New Wave). It was shot completely on location in Paris, and utilized new film-making techniques that would be used by film-making students for decades to come (such as putting the camera in a mail cart on the Champs Elysees and following Belmondo and Seberg). Note Godard's use of American cinema influence, and how the montage art of the 1950s impacted this aesthetic.(A brief New Wave lesson: Most New Wave directors were displeased with the "tradition of quality," or the older generation directors who, as Truffaut put it, made the "twelve or so" pictures per year that represented France at Venice and Cannes. Most of these pictures classic or modern literary adaptations, completely stagnant in artistic quality with rehashed subject matters based on historical periods. New Wave directors supported NEW tales of modern Parisian life, primarily, and were sick of the themes found in the tradition of quality films.) The storytelling methods in Breathless are perhaps the most fascinating part of the film. The jump cuts may seem lame, but one must again view them from a historical context: it had never been done before. This is exactly why Breathless is important -- practically every technique was revolutionary. They are so submerged into film-making practices now that Breathless seems typical. Yet at the time, it was, as I said prior, unprecedented.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the one that started it all kids, the daddy of post-modern cinema. MTV jump cuts, fractured soundtrack and images aplenty Self reflexive to the point that it not only acknowledges its own existence, it revels in it.All style and no substance is considered a bad thing today, unless its Tarantino. Well, if it wasn't for Godard, chances are there would be no QT.All the characters and images, and dialogue and sets are constructed from all aspects of life - Michel is a Bogart collage. Patricia apes everything she sees, from her Interviewee's facial gestures to Michel's own.Don't let all this technical mumbo fool you, I did my thesis on Godard and would happily bore the ass off you with a lecture in great detail about this film, but the fact is, it's a stormer.Grips you by the throat and shakes the hell out of you, and it doesn't let go until the final breath.Fantastically, artistically magnificent. If Godard wanted to make his debut picture to show how well he understood American ideals and the history of cinema, he couldn't have made a better picture.Top stuff French guy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revolutionary. Brilliant. Oh so pretty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Movie, a triumph of the French Nouvelle Vague, marks a turning point, not only for the Director, Jean-Luc Godard, but for anyone who sees it. The plot, though intriguing, is secondary to the incredible presentation. Use of hand-held cameras and jump-cuts (where the director cuts from one angle to a shot of the same angle two seconds later, a stylistic effect that can show freneticism or boredom) were revolutionary at the time, yet can still surprise and delight today.Jean Seaberg is excellent, with the nicest accent you'll ever hear, as are the supporting cast, all rounded stereotypes. But the leading man outshines all the others. A virtuoso display from Jean-Paul Belmondo as Michel Poiccard makes the viewer swoon and scorn in equal measures. He doesn't make it easy for us to empathize with him, yet we still do, and in doing, we feel we have earned something.Revolutionary. Brilliant. Oh so pretty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jean-Luc Godard's, A Bout de Souffle is possibly the brightest star to shine from the French New Wave. The 'Nouvelle Vague' came about from a group of like minded film critics writing for the Cahiers du Cinema.With his knowledge of classic film narrative and style Godard went out to create his own film in homage to, and also complete contradiction to, classic Hollywood film.The plot reads almost like a crime thriller typical of the 1930-40's. A criminal on the run from the police; the distraction of a beautiful woman; the escape and eventually someones death. But it is in Godard's approach to film style and use of new technologies that the typical crime thriller was turned on its head.In a break from classic Hollywood narrative the film opens with little equilibrium. Our protagonist's motives are unclear as he tears off to Paris leaving a woman and a dead cop in his trail. This in turn makes the ending somewhat open ended. With no sense of equilibrium to start with how can there be closure on what has happened throughout the film.Another twist on the classic storytelling in film is the progression of plot. It is naturally assumed in classic Hollywood film, that everything the spectator sees they see for a reason. With Michel's constantly pointless phone calls to retrieve owed money the plot is not pushed along at all. The inclusion of a 25 minute digression from the plot stands to emphasise the spectators reliance on narrative structure in the watching of films. Although watching the film closely is, as always, important in following the story A Bout de Souffle requires that little bit extra to define where the plot is being progressed and where Michel or Patricia are just flattering their egos or each other.All in all I personally think that A Bout de Souffle brought about a sense of realism not seen in Hollywood cinema before 1959 and even now. The fact that life isn't full of clues that will help us progress in say our relationships or escape from authority, but is infact full of digression; self exploration; and the confusions of love, ego and aspirations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To become immortal, and then die</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So says the novelist in response to Patricia's question, "What do you hope to attain out of life?" That response is the philosophy of the film and of every character in the film. All want to be in control of their destiny. All want to be something that they are not. None are able to do any of these things. They are all contradictions. How can you die as an immortal? How can Patricia be free and independent is so many other things determine what she can do? How can this film transcend the screen while existing on the screen? This is an amazing film to watch. Goddard fills every scene with ingenuity and energy. He puts his actors in a beautiful environment and lets them do their thing. And they do it extremely well. The actors are beautiful. Not just cosmetically, but spiritually and psychologically. I am not sure that I liked either of the two main characters. I am sure I could not keep my eyes off them. I could not take my eyes off the screen. Techniques that novices today use for no substantial purpose are utilized by Goddard to amazing effect. The greatest filmmakers are the great editors. Goddard makes the editing a character itself. It is the nervous narrator hurrying the film along. It breathlessly awaits the next scene, and leads us to do the same. I like the way Goddard spends prodigious time simply watching his characters. The conversation scene at the center of the film is amazingly long and drawn out, yet I did not find it boring. I found it fascinating. People are fascinating. Everyone is trying to be something. It takes tremendous talent to indulge in the minutiae of existence. A great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally did it. I finished watching ? bout de souffle. I kept putting it off because I usually have problem when everybody tells me that such and such film is the epitome of its era or it breaks all the rules, starts the revolution, and reinvents the cinema. That's why, probably, I cannot like Citizen Kane - try to watch the arguably best film ever made - you will be under a lot of pressure. Well, ? bout de souffle does not put you under the pressure, it takes you for a ride, and you follow for 90 minutes its incredibly young characters, common crook (Jean-Paul Belmondo) and his American free-spirited girlfriend (Jean Seberg) on their journey on the streets of 1960-th Paris along with Raoul Coutard's legendary camera. I am not going to tell here how great the camera work was, how fantastic the music score and the views of Paris were - the fans of the film know that already. They also know about the beginning of French New Wave, and how it influenced the future cinema. I just want to say that the movie was made over forty years ago - the smoking was cool back then, and Belmondo made smoking look very sexy. Belmondo fascinates me in this film. I've seen him in a lot of later movies - he's always been good (I recommend Le Magnifique, 1973 and Le Professionnel,1981 ) - but in ? bout de souffle he is not just good - he is embodiment of cool, his face changes its expression every moment, you can not take your eyes off him. Is it me or he does remind the very young Mick Jagger - not commonly handsome but irresistible and sexy? He and young (she was 21 at the time) Jean Seaborg made one of the best screen couples ever. My favorite scenes: Michel drives the stolen car in the beginning of the film, and he starts to talk to us, the audience. The day is nice, the sun is shining, and the life is beautiful... Michel and Patricia drive in the convertible. The wind plays with her short hair. We only see the back of her head and her neck. Michel tells her that he loves the girl with a beautiful neck, wrists, knees, but she is a chicken... Patricia comes to the hotel to find Michel in her bed. They start talking about nothing and about very serious things. They smoke, she tries to find a good place for her new poster, and he wants to sleep with her. In the end of the scene, his face, he looks at her - there is love in that look...There is more - I am sure everyone who saw it has his/her favorite scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too cool for (film) school</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Together with François Truffaut's "The 400 Blows" (one of my favorites), Jean-Luc Godard's "Breathless" is considered the defining, instigating film of the French New Wave. It's more ironic and detached, less emotionally accessible than "The 400 Blows," and its technical innovations like jump cuts are perhaps even more surprising. For these reasons, I found "Breathless" easier to admire than to love?though by the end I grew to enjoy its too-cool- for-(film)-school tone.Ironically, the pace of this movie isn't "breathless" at all. It begins abruptly and takes a while to get going: Michel (Jean-Paul Belmondo), a character we barely know, drives a stolen car around, talks at the camera, and shoots a police officer who has tried to pull him over. Then he goes to Paris and tries to borrow money from some friends, while the police-shooting plot goes undeveloped. I only became fully engaged with the introduction of Patricia (Jean Seberg), a young American who sells newspapers on the Champs-Elysees. The relationship between Michel and Patricia is the heart of the film, especially a 25-minute-long scene in Patricia's apartment where the characters smoke, flirt, and laze around in bed, though nothing really happens. That's where I really started to admire "Breathless," because I was so captivated by a scene that, on paper, doesn't sound all that captivating.Eventually the police catch onto Michel and launch a manhunt, but this doesn't really ratchet up the suspense. Instead, Michel is (or at least, Michel acts) aimless and nonchalant about the whole thing?this is not a typical "man on the run" movie. The cool jazz score adds to the hip, laid-back tone.Since I didn't care for the movie too much until the scenes between Michel and Patricia, I believe a lot of the credit for the film's success has to go to the charismatic performances of Belmondo and Seberg. Belmondo, with a perpetual cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth, is the archetypal cocky criminal who models himself after Humphrey Bogart (there's a great scene where he sees some Bogart photos and gets a vulnerable look in his eyes, as though saying "I'll never be as cool as this"). Seberg plays Patricia as a confused girl who is delighted by the attention she gets as an American in France.It's easy to see why "Breathless" was so influential?the jump cuts, the ragged style perfectly match this story about amoral, aimless youth. Definitely a movie that expanded the range of stories the cinema can tell, and perhaps a major precursor to youth-oriented '60s culture. Nearly fifty years later, it still seems "hip," and still challenges our expectations of how movies should behave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most overrated films ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that an artist writes boringly to convey boredom, or childishly to convey puerility, has no effect on the resultant work not being boring nor puerile. Self-awareness of a flaw does not alleviate the flaw. For this to not be true intent in art would have to matter, meaning that all art would necessarily have to be accompanied by a detailed explanation of itself and its conception by the artists, which would therefore render the idea of the art as its own best explanation worthless. Naturally, this would rent the very essence of the artwork.Yet, in recent decades there has been the reflexive notion, usually tossed about by bad artists, that intent is almost all in art, or even that it supersedes actual accomplishment. This results in defenses of bad works of art that inevitably rely on defending the art's intent, not its success in following through on that intent. This has been championed by the 'first thought, best thought' Beatniks of the 1950s, modern Postmodernist thought, and in the 1960s New Wave of French cinema. One of the leading lights of that 'movement' was Jean-Luc Godard, whose first film, Breathless (A Bout de Soufflé- literally, The End Of Breath- 1960), made him a directing superstar. While one cannot dispute the historic import of such a film, historic import has never been equivalent to artistic excellence, and Breathless is a horribly dated film. Yet, even were it not so dated, it would still be a bad film because it is so self-conscious, so poorly written, and so poorly acted, that I thought I was watching a Roger Corman cheapo horror film. Let me state, however, that there is more 'art' in your typical Corman piece from that era, say The Last Woman On Earth, because its commentary on the state of film-making and art was more subtle, if often unintentional. Godard, by contrast, is so garishly dying to show his audience how hip and intellectual he is that he somehow forgot to put any of that, nor substance, into his film.He attempts to capture 'reality' on film without realizing that anything filmed becomes unreal, or irreal, as opposed to surreal. Thus, the art of film, or any art, can NEVER be real, and to convey reality most aptly, it needs to be most affected. Godard, by shooting his film with hand-held camera, as Parisians gawk at the filming in process, thus makes the most artificial of films, even as he tries to show the most boring aspects of life, glossing over crimes and 'deep' moments that other films contain, to show the dull times. He thus gets the two worst aspects of film- the 'artificiality' of cinema verité and the reality of dull life, rather than the two best: the 'reality' of film as artifice and the artifice of poetically chosen reality.What little story the tale has starts abruptly. It is an odd start, but not unlike many bad 1950s kids' television shows, nor contemporaneous B horror films like Carnival Of Souls. A hood named Michel Poiccard (Jean-Paul Belmondo) steals a car in Marseilles and drives to Paris. On his way there, he is stopped for speeding and shoots a policeman. This goes by so quickly and without explanation that the viewer cannot empathize with him. Once in Paris, he needs to get money from a friend and flirts with an American female student named Patricia Franchini (Jean Seberg) he has had an affair with. They wax in and out of fancy with one another, and on it goes?. Across the pond, in America, at the time Breathless was being filmed, John Cassavetes was also making his feature film debut as a director, with Shadows, and although there is an amateurish quality to some aspects of that film, and it was not nearly praised as highly as Breathless, it was much less amateurish than this film, and holds up far better today, as a 'realist' piece of film-making. Breathless, by contrast, can only be defended as a historical curio, not artistically on its own merits, which is exactly what virtually all online essays that defend it do. Cassavetes' first film, by contrast, stands alone, and his usage of overlapping and realistic dialogue, not culled nor self-consciously quoted from Hollywood film dialogue, is far better than Godard's, which was stillborn when fellow auteur Francois Truffaut abandoned the screenplay to Godard. Godard captured none of the film noir joie de vivre that he hoped to, while Cassavetes brought American real life dialogue to the screen at the same time. Godard's characters never utter a believable line of dialogue. It is all a put on, for Michel is no more a gangster type than Belmondo- the actor who plays him, is, nor even Humphrey Bogart- the actor Michel imitates throughout the film. This is seen by apologists, however, as the film's style, although this so-called style is really stylelessness, and that is no more artistic than claiming formless Dave Eggersian puerility as a writing style?.Later filmmakers went leagues beyond Godard, and actually demanded their innovations serve the film's tale, rather than merely being a piece of self-indulgence a haphazard and wan tale is draped over. With no good execution, no real depth, nor character development, what was intended as satire becomes, instead, awkward and obvious imitation, not witty enough for comedy, and more resembling something like film noir lite.John Cassavetes was doing similar things in America, but doing them much better, for his filmic improvisations never came across as 'improvisations', but 'reality'. In short, for all the claims to the contrary, this film, at least, does not reveal a unique innovator in his art form, but an old Romantic masquing as a hipster, and wildly cobbling together a Frankensteinian mess. In America we call that person a poseur. In France they apparently call them geniuses?.just like, um, Jerry Lewis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When critics or viewers praise a film only because it was technically innovative when it was made ... beware. It may mean that the film has either minimal entertainment value or minimal thematic content. Such is indeed the case with "Breathless", a film noted for the director's willingness to break rules of traditional cinema. This film is far more improvised, more off-the-cuff, then "staged" films made in years prior to 1960.The story, about an unlikeable cad who romances a young woman in Paris, is dull as dishwater. It has no thematic depth. The script treatment, written by Francois Truffaut a year or two before Jean-Luc Godard filmed the movie, is used more or less as the basis for the plot and the dialogue, sans screenplay. And it shows!Characters are not well thought out. Our cad is a killer and a petty thief who smokes a lot. He's also obnoxious. At one point he looks directly into the camera and tells viewers: "If you don't like ... then get stuffed!" The young woman is unremarkable in every way, apart from her unisex hairdo, which may have been chic in 1960; today it looks atrocious.Likewise, the film's improvised dialogue is horrible. At one point the cad asks the young woman: "Why are you looking at me?" Her response: "Because I'm looking at you". And then later, the woman says "Well, I don't know yet whether I love you". The cad asks: "When will you know?" She responds: "Soon". He asks: "What does soon mean? In a month, a year?" She answers "Soon means soon". Submit a screenplay to a studio these days with dialogue like that, and see what happens.Casting and acting are mediocre and bland. The two main roles are not demanding. The film's production design conveys the impression that Godard was trying to appeal to an audience of haughty sophisticates. Thus, we get an artist's studio, convertible sports cars, and lots of cigarette smoking. The background music is mostly light jazz, and when combined with the costumes, production design, and hairstyles makes the film seem very dated.Maybe "Breathless" was Godard's way of breaking through as a major film director in 1960, specifically by thumbing his nose at Hollywood film directors from previous decades. And there's some merit to that. But I'm viewing this film in 2009, not 1960; and I'm a viewer, not a film director. A film that has nothing to offer but innovation, invisible to the viewer, runs the risk of being time bound, imprisoned in its own era.And I have no doubt that "Breathless" was technically innovative. As such, it's a film that deserves to be read about in film history books, and seen by film historians and film students. But as entertainment for a general audience decades after it was made, and in its overall thematic content, it has little or nothing to offer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"? Bout de Soufflé" aka "Breathless", was the first full-length film directed by the controversial Jean-Luc Godard, and the first film of his long career that I've had the chance to see so far. "Breathless" is the landmark film of the Nouvelle Vague (New Wave), when young filmmakers such as François Truffaut thrilled the audiences and shocked the Establishment.Although some people may not be as impressed with "Breathless" structure as they were in 1960, it remains a terrific, breathtaking film experience and has aged wonderfully. Such masterpieces live up to the hype and time, even though they're not as technically impressive as they were 40 years ago, and they're still powerful thanks to what great films consist of: passion. As another user rightfully stated, we have to look at "Breathless" from a historical point: it's different from any other previous film. Godard was truly a visionary and an incredibly talented, passionate "auteur"."Breathless" plot is rather simple: Michel Poiccard/Laszlo Kovacs (Jean-Paul Belmondo), our anti-hero, is a young criminal on the run from the police, after stealing a car and killing a cop. He has an affair with a beautiful young American, Patricia (Jean Seberg), an aspiring journalist who sells the New York Herald Tribune in the middle of the Champs Élysées (her first scene here was paid a tribute by Eva Green in Bertolucci's "The Dreamers"), and is also expecting Michel's baby. Patricia helps Michel to dodge the police, while they steal cars together in order to raise money for a trip to Rome. But when you want to "vivre dangereusement jusqu'au bout" - or, live dangerously till the end, things may end up not so well.When you see Belmondo touching his lips, trying to imitate Humphrey Bogart's trade mark, Seberg walking on the Élysées as lovely as a girl can be, the unforgettable final moments...you don't worry about theories on why this is a classic. "? Bout de Soufflé" is Cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ladies and Gentlemen, the 8th Wonder of the World: Jean-Luc Godard.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the one that started it all. With the story of a man on the run calling himself Laszlo Kovacs (a cinematographer of the time), Jean-Luc Godard arrived in the movies (well, on the production end, at least). This also more than his typical film essay. The story by Francois Truffaut makes for a terrific Godard script (the Truffaut stamp makes it comparable to SHOOT THE PIANO PLAYER). Jean-Paul Belmondo does well in the Kovacs role, humanizing our bad-guy hero right up to the slam-bang finish. Jean Seberg is his conflicted lover who must... well, just watch. A landmark of the French New Wave, which is one of the most important movements in cinema. Vastly superior to the 1983 BREATHLESS with Richard Geer and Fassinder's homage THE AMERICAN SOLDIER. This is guaranteed to be like few movies you've seen before (unless, of course, you're a fan of the New Wave). BREATHLESS is also very memorable for its music and unusual photography. Shows how European film brought out the importance of character in film and raised it to new heights (whereas in American film, a close-up is the closest you'll get to character development). This is a must for any film student and for anyone who just loves movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been watching Breathless for the first time in many years on the Sundance Channel. Jean-Luc Godard's cinema changing film about a young tough in love with American movies and an American girl changed European cinema.I don't know if it was for the better or worse. My only real memory of watching the film from my film class days was the sense that one could see how it was copied by other filmmakers of the period. I retained very little of the plot. Actually I retained very little of anything concerning the film after each of the two or three times I've seen it. Watching it again for the first time in probably five or six years I'm struck by how silly it all is. Once the height of fashion and hip coolness I was not so quietly giggling to myself. The film has not aged very well and has become almost a parody of itself. I could feel the pretensions flooding off the screen. This isn't to say the film isn't good, it is on some level, however I think its better if viewed in the context of when it came out, instead of what it is today. Forgive me if I offend with this position, but watching Jean Seberg struggle with her French and Jean-Paul Belmondo attempt to be cool, is almost too funny for words. (Belmondo reminded me of a cousin who always tried to be hip and cool and tough, but instead came off as silly). Worth a look if you're interested in milestones of the cinema, however I think you may be hard pressed to make it to the end with a straight face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reviewing the IMDb comments, there are certainly a lot of mixed reactions to this film. Just about everyone admits its an impressive technically and very innovative film. However, there are arguments about whether or not it is of value story wise. Some regard it as a masterpiece of iconic cool with Belmondo's character on the level with James Dean as a rebel fighting the establishment. Many others complain that in addition to being incredibly slow-moving and confusing, you grow to hate the two main characters and eventually don't care about their fates. I am a member of the first camp as I feel this film is both a masterpiece of innovation and characters.First off, I'll explain what made this film so groundbreaking. Yes, the jump cut techniques have been used many times since and often to negative effect. They work well here though and give the film a very avant-garde feel. Even more so than that however are the characters. Belmondo's character is an anti-hero through and through. He is unlikeable, annoying, and makes constantly bad judgment. Yet at the same time he is cool, rebellious, and oddly sympathetic at the conclusion. This and "Yojimbo" created the modern anti-hero. As his American girlfriend, Jean Seberg is also very charismatic and they have great chemistry together.Past the innovations, many have complained this is a film more to be appreciated than enjoyed. I disagree. The characters are interesting and the screenplay is believable. Many have said its slowly paced. It can be at times but its never boring as every scene contributes. I didn't find the bedroom conversation to be as tiring as everyone else seems to. Overall, if you have any interest in the history of film, you must see this at least one. Love it or hate it, just admit that it was very ahead of its time. (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revolutionary but I'm still allowed to hate Godard.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of this time period in cinema, but I've never liked Godard, as much as my peers fawned over his 'daring' style in films like this and Woman is a Woman, I find his work emotion-less, obscure and subversive for obscurity and subversity's sake and bratty. I understand the intrigue, particularly if you were alive and young when this film was showing for the first time in the cinema, in his style, his breaking all common laws of cinema, but I find what his co-conspirators in his generation like Michelangelo Antonioni, Eric Rohmer, Agnes Varda and even Truffaut to be just as dramatically daring but on more subtle and affecting levels than Godard. Breathless just never hit me the way it did others, but I can appreciate how it influenced everybody down the generations. I preferred My Life to Live, in my opinion the best film Godard made...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Breathless is an over hyped French movie with some good dialogs and some good camera work. The plot is almost non-existent ? a car thief kills a cop and then spends the rest of the film persuading the girl he loves to have sex with him and run away with him to Rome. Both have some cute and some rather irritating conversations It looked like the kind of film which pseudo intellectuals will discuss, just cause someone told him or her it is important. It could have been important considering it has some thousand jump cuts, poor synchronization of Audio and Visual, not to mention actions cut in the middle and scenes which start and stop out of nowhere.Godard makes basic syntactical errors with his film-making and accidentally (to my mind) discovers jump cuts and so the film becomes important. He sure is lucky!!Its like reading a book with wrong English and then saying how poetic. The problem with breathless is that even the mistakes committed by Godard do not actually make it easy to watch. Had that been the case we could have called it art but the bottom-line is that the mistakes look like they are mistakes and nothing more, It gave me a headache to watch this , why ?? because incessant editing do not a good movie make. Just because somebody did for the first time that too unintentionally does not an iconic movie make. I read somewhere on one of the posts in the boards that Godard did this to give the viewer a sense that it is a film and that he is there to change it I refuse to buy that theory. If that was the case almost every next scene wouldn't skip and jump and only some relevant scenes would have been jump cutted as per the shot setting. Art does not mean that you cut the scene before it ended and leave it a loose end. As a matter of fact it is a must watch for film school types as an example of how not to make mistakes of the basic rules of connecting shots while editing.Other stuff in the film is also not up to the mark. The action of the characters in the film seem rather whimsical and the end comes across as confused. The acting of some rather stylish actors appear rather sad thanks to the half cut scenes. The initial sounding befitting background music is used so much that you get bored of it by the end. After watching Breatheless. I realized that a good population of film freaks act on the power of suggestion rather than looking at how unreal a possibility is. To sum it in some two words. Over-Hyped. Pseudo Intellectual. Not Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once upon a time I went to watch this marvel or world cinema at a special Goddard screening at the Curzon Soho cinema in London, lured by the raving reviews I had read in many occasions... It remains to this day as one of the most insufferable films I have ever watched... Enduring that ninety-minute screening session was something like going through a whole treatment under the mercies of the Spanish Inquisition... OK, I admit that making a film on a ridiculously low budget is not easy. But when the script is total rubbish, the acting is insufferable and the camera work is absolutely murderous, then any useless moron on this planet can make a movie.They really thought they were making film history by using a hand-held camera again and again and again?!! Either they were high on weed or they were taking the audience for idiots. The director and the camera operator should have been locked-up to stop them from making more crap like this in the future.The Belmondo character should have been shot in the first five minutes of the film. Personally I'd wish I could soak him in petrol and set him alight. One of the most overrated films in cinema history. A total and absolute waist of celluloid, money and audiences's time. I should have spent the ?8 of my ticket on booze instead. At least I would have got a lot more enjoyment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've never seen the BBC sitcom Black Adder, there is a scene in which the idiotic Baldrick hands Black Adder a copy of his novel (his "maximum octopus"), and it goes like this: "Once upon a time there was a lovely little sausage called Baldrick, and he lived happily ever after. The End." Black Adder, quite rightly, deems it "completely and utterly awful." Now imagine if the intellectuals of the day heralded Baldrick's manuscript as one of the best novels ever written, and it appeared constantly on critics' All-Time-Top-Ten lists. This is very close to the situation that has actually occurred with Breathless. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen (and I'm a regular viewer of MST3K), and it is lauded by critics and famous film makers alike as a true masterpiece, up there with Citizen Kane, The Searchers, and Modern Times. Apparently, if you make a movie disjointed, poorly edited, illogically paced, and really uninteresting, all you have to do is be French, call it "new wave" and you can get away with it. Before you commie elitist snobs say I don't know what I'm talking about (probably too late), let me say I'm no stranger to so-called sophisticated films. My favorites are Andrei Rublev, 2001, 8 1/2, and The Thin Red Line, not exactly Big Momma's House. Some might be inclined to say that this movie is a style over substance, except it has no style. It has nothing. It is an artistic black hole, playing its modernist siren song to weak-minded intellectuals (a contradiction in terms, I know) and wasting people's time for over 40 years. One day, maybe five thousand years from now (give or take...), critics and cineastes will rightly ignore this movie, perceiving it's heyday popularity as a mere freak occurrence in public opinion, like disco or hula-hoops. Those of us who value rightness, decency, and good movies like The Crowd, can only hope.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Breathless (1960)You can't help but like and hate a movie like this. It's insulting to women--note at least the scene where lead female Jean Seberg is conducting a high level interview and when she gets to ask a question, the man being interviewed makes a play for her, and she likes it, and that's that. She doesn't even write down the answer. And yet "Breathless" is a kind of worship of Seberg, incomparably sharp and stunning in director Jean-Luc Godard's take.But Godard is such a darling of the intellectual anti-Hollywood, Hollywood worshipping French New Wave, everyone looks the other way. In fact, the movie, its history and reception then and now, is a contradictory affair. It begs for patience, and yet it sucks you in whether you like it or not. There is a Bonnie and Clyde kind of outlaw aspect to it all, and an identification with the counter-culture, anti-hero aspects above all. It lurches and has awkward cuts, sometimes on purpose, and yet it seems so utterly intentional and forceful anyway, you have to pay attention.The low-budget, homemade look to the movie is off-putting to many viewers, except those looking for an answer to the slickness of Hollywood. And that's exactly what this is. In a way, while other French New Wave films were bowing to the great 1940s and 50s masterpieces, this one pushes its raw edges far enough to announce its independence from that influence, and hence it has something of a legendary status. But to really watch it is to see that it's close to the art films of the time, like the short "Pull My Daisy," filled with joyful, youthful indifference to polish and tradition. You are to ignore the flaws. In fact, flaws, like the drips on an Ab-Ex painting or the squawks of a sax, are part of the effect, necessary.There are wonderful cinematic moments, some filming in classic (if improvised) beauty (elevator scenes, a pan from one bathroom door to another, driving at night in a convertible, the two leads under the sheets in the apartment). It has a simple jazz score, the camera-work is hand-held and the sound dubbed in later (quite obviously), and the plot is actually a bit improbable, despite the realism enforced technically. There are layers of meaning, sitting in a theater and hearing the dialog there, or echoing themes of love and meaning in the interview where it is least likely, but you don't mind (or aren't supposed to mind) in what is so overtly a work of art.That is the huge point, in the end. This isn't a Hollywood "product" in any sense, but a private "auteur" effort that happened to succeed financially. This attests to both the innate feeling the film creates in a viewer, and the cultural need out there for something genuine in the theater. By 1960, traditional Hollywood seemed to many, even for films made in 1959 (or especially those, just look at a list of them), dull and out of touch. Here was a real alternative.I found it alternately frustrating and magical. Take your pick, but don't miss it. The last few minutes are as transcendent and affected as almost anything in film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not an expert in movie techniques or cinema history, I couldn't even give a definition of new wave. I am not even a big fan of Godard, except for "a bout de soufflz". This movie deserves to be in the top 10. But if you look at ratings, it's basically either 10 or 1. I am not going to describe why this movie is so good, I wouldn't be able to anyway. But I think the effect of it lies in Michel's character (kind of crazy, cynical, with an incredible distant and happy attitude and self confidence that gives him some particular charm. Belmondo's performance to act this especially complex and subtle character is outstanding), and the overall realization that gets you like some abstract paintings sometimes do. Surely lots of people wrote tons of technical stuffs to explain all this. Now why so many of so-called movie enthusiast in the IMDb hated it? I understood from reading the reviews that many of them are from students who "had" to watch it for their class. I guess it's not the best way to appreciate it. As there is no way anyone could appreciate the Mona Lisa in the Louvre museum, looking at it at 10 m in a crowd. A word that comes a lot is "boring". I guess some people don't see in movies anything else than a technique used as a support for a storyline. It's like saying food is just fuel to walk. I guess they're the same who put all these blockbusters in the top 250. Not that I don't like Hollywood big productions but they don't go at all beyond entertainment, which is good but not enough. And finally, there might be some cultural misunderstanding. A reviewer wrote that he hated Michel because he kept stealing cars...I was just puzzled by such stupidity. This is definitely not a movie to be watched if you have been formatted by TV and Hollywood blockbusters since you were born, like apparently a growing majority of IMDb members.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bout de soufflé is not a good film, no matter what people might tell you. If it was, people would still be making movies like this that don't make any sense, and everyone would love them. The whole point, though, of French New Wave was that it was breaking the rules, and thus was more of an experiment than an attempt to make proper movies. Undoubtedly, some of the techniques and styles have had a lasting influence on modern cinema, so it's certainly fair to regard A bout de soufflé as an important piece of work. However, many people will swear that they were thoroughly entertained by it, and will name it as one of their favourite films of all time. Those people are usually hideously pretentious, and if you disagree with them, you'll be told, or at least made to feel, that you are somehow intellectually deficient, and therefore unable to understand a work of such substance. The truth is, you're just perfectly sane, and know a turd when you see one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... You will love this I know little about French new wave cinema except that it's an acquired taste . Off the top of my head I think the only movie I've seen in this genre is ALPHAVILLE a crime drama does as science fiction unless you count FARENHEIT 451 where Francois Traffaut uses some of his French art house influences in the movie I did enjoy A BOUT DE Soufflé ( BREATHLESS ) for the most part mainly because of its bizarre feel . We see anti hero Michel lay down how he feels about both France and woman drivers in the opening sequence , we see the first use of a technique called " Jump cut " in cinema ( It's not but is often claimed to be . The truth is " jump cut " is as old as cinema itself ) , we see hand held camera / fly on the wall directing and perhaps most strangely of all we are treated to an inappropriate soundtrack though this is of course done on purpose The only other performance I recall seeing from Jean Paul Belmondo is the end scenes of CASINO ROYALE but he's very good here as Michel . Considering he's a murderer who is not above mugging and conning people you can't help liking his cheek and arrogance , he's very much an anti hero from a byegone age where sexism and chain smoking wasn't a sin . How I miss that eraI gave this movie seven out of ten but I should point out I have seen a massive amount of movies ( I've reviewed over 1200 on this site )and like many other people who have praised A BOUT DE Soufflé I am a film buff . If you've come to this page , seen all the good reviews and decided that you must see this movie at all costs then I still have to warn you that you may not like it much if you only watch Hollywood blockbusters . I don't say this in an arrogant elitist way , only that French new wave cinema is an acquired taste</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though I do feel guilty only giving this a 6. In some ways, however, it does not even deserve that. Godard was a great critic. Verbally at first. Then spent his life criticizing movies with a camera. Probably out of boredom with the essential insubstantiality of almost every movie ever made. Here you can almost hear him perpetually yelling at behind the camera, well life is boring but not when you rev it up with a Mitchell at 24 frames a second. That said, I am grateful to something like Breathless. There has still been no movie quite like it. Its innocence is really astonishing. Not sure if anyone here ever mentioned (while allowing for the tremendous influence of the film) if Bonnie and Clyde would ever have remotely looked or sounded like it did without this precursor. And Bonnie and Clyde is another movie that I am extremely ambivalent about, another guilty pleasure, feeling both movies fall very short of greatness. But both really are a lot of fun.If any part of Breathless bothers me more than the rest it is the last, the scene where Patricia starts practically yodeling to herself about why she turned Michel in. And then almost everything after that. Here Godard tries to finally give reasons for these lunkheads actions and betrays the film. Still.Right.Glad he made the thing. Just don't get too involved in the philosophy which is ridiculous, mostly. Very great look at Paris though. And maybe the best home movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my dictums of reviewing is that the length of a review often reveals the interest of the reviewer of the subject matter. Was the reviewer reviled, ecstatic or somewhere in between? More or less text, piqued or not, we can make a guess. I note some pretty lengthy comments are provoked by reviewers of "Breathless". I suspect we like it more than we let on.How can you not? Art house fare is not about pandering to mainstream tastes. So we see some physically stunning actors acting in a very counterculture manner, and are treated to the viewing a real film accomplishment - successfully delivering a product with "Risk" written all over it.How anyone cannot accept that this was and is a film classic is beyond me. Great film is separated from the not so great and the poor by a few factors. They might be handsome stars, great lines, over the top "special moments" - how many Caddies and TBirds were in Paris in 1960 - small touches like Belmondo's use of a cigarette like Bogart could not have matched or nice musical touches or the neat use of the camera or two people idly chatting in bed as young people do about nothing and everything. So which of these things does the movie lack? If you want coherent straight ahead dialogue and action Gene Autry made a whole series of nice films for your delight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sure it revolutionized movies, no argument there, but it's not that much fun to watch thirty-odd years later.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Godard's 'Breathless' is regarded as one of the most important and influential movies of the modern era. And you'll get no argument from me on that score. But unlike other classics by Hitchcock, Welles, Lang, Kubrick or Peckinpah, it is a movie to be admired, but not I'm sad to say enjoyed. Watching it to me is almost like doing homework. You can immediately see in what ways it must have been daring and innovative at the time, and you can understand how many things about it, (especially the editing, which alternates jerky cuts with slow passages of dialogue about "nothing"), influenced everything from 'Easy Rider' to 'Reservoir Dogs'. But is it entertaining viewing? No. Belmondo and Seberg are cool and charismatic and act impressively, but you never care one hoot for their relationship or what happens to them. The crime angle of 'Breathless' is just a Macguffin, and Godard just uses it as an excuse for some (admittedly) very impressive shots. In many ways it is quite a cold movie. The viewer is deliberately kept at a distance, and this is its ultimate downfall. I would recommend 'Breathless' as as essential viewing for every film buff because of its technique and style, but if you were to ask me if I honestly ENJOY watching this movie I would have to say no, I don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More fun to discuss than to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching Jean-Luc Godard's massively influential, unintentional-classic Breathless and discussing Jean-Luc Godard's massively influential, unintentional-classic Breathless are two totally different things. For one, the latter is more fun the other and, two, discussing the film almost instantly allows for quality, intelligent discussion of cinema to ring. There are certain cinephiles that take Godard himself more seriously than they take any other director who has ever lived. Just when you thought Stanley Kubrick-fanatical elitism was out of control, spend about ten minutes, as an exercise, scouring the internet for French New Wave forums and in-depth analysis of the Godardian methods and you may be surprised at what you find.I'm only stating this because around a year and a half ago, I began my sporadic voyage into the depths of Godard with his most recent picture, at the time, Film Socialisme, which I found to be an assault on every conceivable sense and not in a particularly good way. The film was choppy, disjointed, messy, just about as incomprehensible as it could be, and trying to find justifications or analyses online proved ineffective. All and all, it's a film I just want to forget and I didn't care to dive into Godard much after that endeavor. I now realize that a decent part of the blame is on me for choosing perhaps the wrong film to begin my Godardian journey with. I emerge from seeing Breathless (known by its French title as ? bout de soufflé) with a more of a positive reaction. This is a bravely-structured and maturely handled annihilation to every cinematic convention prior to its 1960 release down with class and impenetrable style on part of Godard.The story - even though it is relatively the least of our concerns - follows Michel (Jean-Paul Belmondo), who is trying to emulate the characteristics possessed by Humphrey Bogart during the particular 40s/50s era of menacing American crime dramas that billed him as the lead actor. One day, feeling intimidated and a perhaps a little adventurous, Michel shoots a police officer who has been tailing him and now must deal with being broke and on the run from the cops. His only companion is Patricia (Jean Seberg), an American journalist getting by in life by selling newspapers in downtown Paris. The two desperately skim through their options trying to hide from the police, one of which is skipping town and going all the way to Italy as fugitives.I say the story is the least of our concerns because there is simply not much to it. After all, Breathless is an aesthetic breakthrough rather than a narrative one. Godard employs dangerously subversive jump cuts - where the camera cuts to another shot within the same frame creating a breach in continuity - along with rapid-fire, quick shots and lengthy dialog scenes. All of this broke French cinema convention, which, prior to this, was consistently polished and very elegant. Godard invited in a rebellious messiness to the picture, almost like the guy coming into a neatly-organized room and rustling all the papers and files to not only create a stir but to do something different, something completely new.It's almost shortchanging to simply say that I have immense respect for Godard seeing as in 1960, a time when social change and civil unrest amongst adolescents and twentysomethings seemed to be so prevalent in many different places, he ushered in a new way of doing things cinematically and created a stylistically bold film because of it. He even threw in the element of using a hand-held camera, an unheard of practice during this particular time. I think I would also be in line to compare Breathless to Bonnie and Clyde, a film that would enter the picture seven years later in American studios that would simultaneous shock and stimulate audiences everywhere.Godard's films have a unique power after you watch them. For example, it has been about four days since I sat down to watch Breathless and since watching it - and now writing a medium-length analysis of it - I have a strong, biting urge to watch more of Godard's films. His films have the kind of impact where you just want to talk about them and talk about their impact in great length; which, once more, brings me to the point that watching the films is actually the weaker part compared to discussing them.Starring: Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg. Directed by: Jean-Luc Godard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Between '60 and '69,Belmondo made his finest roles:Michel Poiccard (in ? bout De Soufflé),Gabriel Fouquet (in Un Singe En Hiver),Adrien Dufourquet (in L'Homme De Rio),Louis Mahé (in La Sir?ne Du Mississipi).(To be fair,one must admit that Delon also had his era:he was casted by Luchino Visconti and Michelangelo Antonioni;by René Clément,Jean-Pierre Melville.)Belmondo and Delon used the '60s in very different ways.During this ten years,Belmondo managed to show how great an actor he is (while Delon almost managed to hide how average an actor he is,to hide his narrowness).I have seen Belmondo teamed with Gabin,teamed with Mrs. Deneuve:he stands out.One of the best actors working in the French cinema in the '60s.He kept his hand in.The substance of the lives of Belmondo and Jean Seberg may be an object of Godard's caustic satire,but it is also an aesthetic ideal, and the movie is very involved in the aesthetics of life.Irony or aesthetic ideal of life?Certainly both.Is this way of life mythologized?Again,its status is very ambiguous,and the whole movie is conceived as a system of mirrors.It works as a pump of unreality.Failure,mettle,misdemeanors,a mischief-maker rogue, affectation,the ordinary cruelty,a form of extremism;Godard's attitude is a purely aesthetic and playful one,he has no lesson to teach.The 2 characters' ineptitude and insanity are depicted as such. Still,the movie is not an anecdote,but has many features of,as I said,an "aesthetic ideal" of life. Belmondo and Jean Seberg are tackling a form of sadism that will finally crack one of them. He is a disabused bum,but she is a false ingénue,an irresponsible girl inebriated with "dangerously living",the substance of all nihilism.Belmondo has already rolled the dices;he is a murderer,a deranged outlaw. Jean Seberg's amorality is also turning into hideousness,so that the two fail side by side."A bout ..." proves that,even if he was not a great director,Godard was an intelligent,inventive and playful one. After all,this is a movie about cinema,not about life.Its freshness and freedom make it one of the most sympathetic French shows.It is so funny and unconventional,so nuanced and intelligent,so veined and powerful,so robust and enjoyable.The youngish Belmondo is an apotheosis of the cool,and here really at his most cool,and with a easiness that belongs to the most endowed only;his most cool,not in spoofing the American look,but in his exploits and getting out of ruck."Poiccard" is the bum himself,the quintessence of the rogue.A word about "? bout De Soufflé"'s remake:the Gere film (Breathless (1983),directed by Jim McBride) is made within a very different set of parameters,an low-brow adventure movie,and practically unrelated to Godard's movie;it offers perhaps Gere's best role,and it is a very good movie.</fullReview>

Photography alone doesn't make a film.I didn't care if the main character got caught by police or not. The film fails to really make you care about any of its characters in it. To me, Michel was just another aimless punk that was completely self- centered. Nothing really made me care what happened to him.I just kept on looking for some kind of value in the film and found little there.

Godard owes much of his film's success to the tremendous screen presence of his two leads, the smoldering Jean-Paul Belmondo and the hipster gamine Jean Seberg. These two create a vision of spontaneous romance that feels loose and free, in contrast to the rigid romantic formulas imposed on Hollywood products of the time.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>? bout de soufflé is fast, cool, literate, entertaining and stylish. Just rush the words out and there you have it. A stunning classic. Loose, casual, and bad to know. This film is attitude. A knowing and intelligent film deeply influenced by American gangster thrillers will itself becoming influential. Look at who we have here: Francois Truffaut as writer, Jean-Luc Godard as director and Jean-Paul Belmondo as the star. This is the start of the French New Wave. Bang. Like a shot out of a gun. This is how the French do A Rebel Without A Cause - as Peter John Dyer said: "A film all dressed up for rebellion but with no real tangible territory on which to stand and fight".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jean-Paul Belmondo (Michel) is an arsehole. We know this because he tells us so at the beginning of the film. And he's not wrong. He shoots a policeman and then hides out with Jean Seberg (Patricia) whom he met a few weeks previously. She is also annoying and they both spend a lot of time talking about whether or not they love each other while Belmondo tries to contact a mate to get some money in order to make his escape. However, the police are on his tail.We don't get much in terms of story and we get absolutely zero understanding as to why the characters are how they are. I found it difficult to relate to these people and certainly felt no connection with Belmondo at any point in the film.You are forced into watching the film with an emotional detachment and whilst it is interesting to see the different techniques on show, all of which you will have seen before so they are not that interesting today, credit must be given for doing it first. However, this is style over substance. Without an interesting story, we are left with an arty-farty film which plods along. It's OK while you watch it ? nothing more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much hyped IMO.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After viewing the film in one break, I can say that it was unable to impress me. I had a lot of hope from this, but this one is a letdown. The story was simple and what I didn't like was the editing pattern. The story revolves around a man who has just killed a Policeman and is on the run. The story is sometimes confusing, too obvious and a little amazing behavior is shown in the characters at other times. The man wants to take the girl with him to someplace quiet. Whether he loved her genuinely or not is still unclear to me.PROS: The starting scenes and the acting of the lead member were good.CONS: The film fails in giving a nice story which would have otherwise hidden the unusual editing. For the entire film I was confused about what they wanted to convey.Verdict: "Watch for experiments in filmmaking."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acquired taste, maybe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've generally found Truffaut's films more easily accessible. After having seen "The 400 Blows," "The Woman Next Door" (I believe is the translation) and "Tirez sur le Pianiste" I have to say that Truffaut's films are more interesting (in general). There's no doubt Godard was a huge influence with the French New Wave that stormed America in the '60s but as one other reviewer notes, it's an acquired taste. Personally I feel some of the '60s French cinema is just a bit too cold and experimental to really find fascinating -- one of the reasons Truffaut's films work so well is that they find a good human balance to rely on. (Tirez sur le Pianiste - Shoot the Pianist - is a brilliant satire of '30s/'40s/'50s gangster movies with interesting characters.)"A bout de soufflé" (a.k.a. "Breathless") is an essential film to view if you are a film buff and French cinema enthusiasts will adore it, however I can't help but think of it as a piece of history rather than a motion picture that has stood the test of time. I'm tempted to say it's just not entertaining enough although that might sound dense.In short it just doesn't hold up as well to some of the "killers on the run"-style stories that have been made recently (and no, I was not a fan of "True Romance").Still, some good performances and its famous stature in film history guarantees this is a "must-see," even if you feel a bit disappointed after seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It may well be better known for its influence than its value as a film but it is a great piece of iconic cool with great dialogue delivered by two very strong performances in the leads</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When he is pulled over for speeding, small time car thief Michel Poiccard shoots and kills a motorcycle police officer. Abandoning his stolen car and fleeing across the countryside he arrives back home in Paris penniless and needing somewhere to lie low. He turns to his American girlfriend Patricia for help and she takes him in. The pair spend the next few days making love, talking and stealing cars to get enough money to get to Italy; however as the police close in on Michel he gets increasingly desperate and fed up.Having gone to the cinema earlier and suffered the American version of Taxi, I decided to try and purge the badness from my system by watching a classic or two over the next few days ? one of these classics was this film, which I do believe everyone who loves the cinema should try and see this at least once if only to be able to understand the wider origins and influences on the people who are currently influencing the next generation. Regardless of why you watch this, it is likely that modern audiences will not be won over by it as much as they really should be ? certainly people I have talked to about the film seem to wonder what all the fuss is about (one even going so far as to lament the absence of Richard Gere!). I was of course impressed by the use of the much name-dropped technique of jump-cuts but seeing them now it is easy to forget that this was new then. Away from its place in the formation of modern cinema and its influence on many modern directors, this is a great film in its own right even if the rather laid back (typically French?) telling may annoy some audiences.For me the film relies on dialogue and characters and both of these are well delivered. The film seems to have a lot of talking between the two lead characters but this work as long as you can buy into the very cool and laid back philosophising about love, literature and life. I think that in the context of Paris as it is presented here that it works very well but then I had also been in stitches over the funny short film 'J'Aime John Wayne' which spoofs the 'Gallic cool' portrayed in this film. The lead characters work well because of the dialogue but they are also very well presented by the two leads. If someone played like Belmondo today I would be the first to deride him but here he is setting the reasons why nobody can do it again by becoming an iconic figure in modern cinema. He is not so much carefree and just very ambivalent about everything ? America has its Rebels Without A Cause but to me Belmondo was very much a French version of a cultural rebel.Seberg is very good and makes her dialogue feel natural and convincing even though it could have been pretentious and annoying. Together they have not only chemistry but also a confidence within their own characters. Of course the direction still feels fresh today ? freely moving around city streets and country roads but also coming in for close ups on the actors faces. Godard continues the feel of his short films and it much better than if it had been constrained by sets on soundstages.Overall this is a great film that you should see if only so that you can say you have seen it. It may be hard to see what all the fuss is about now, because we are looking back on technical things that are now the norm, but the film is still strong on the 'normal' basis of story, directing, acting etc. The film is full of iconic images as well as a very French sense of detached cool that is very much of its time but it is also an interesting character piece with good dialogue and good performances from Seberg and Belmondo, who can't have been aware of what they were taking part in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>French New Wave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An early piece of New Wave cinema by Goddard in the days before his films became totally incomprehensible, it was inspirational for directors like Bertolucci in its vigour and willingness to challenge conventional attitudes. The film is, in fact, deeply morally ambivalent, with Belmondo as the 'cool' hero with no apparent loyalty or obligation to anyone but himself, but like Antonioni's L'Avventura it seems to usher in a new kind of world, a world of complexity, uncertainty and, in the case of Bout de Souffle, a world dominated by the young. It would not be too far from the truth to see most pop videos of today as direct descendants of this film. Seberg's performance is strangely melancholic, presaging the later tragedies of her own life, and the image of her wandering the streets of Paris as a young girl selling copies of The International Herald Tribune is for some reason the one that I remember most clearly from this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is the movie over yet?I've watched this movie twice and find it dull, dull, dull. The leads are both attractive, of course, but jump cuts aside, I see nothing very entertaining about this film.Then again, I have seen two other Godard films and found them dull, dull, dull."Alphaville" is supposedly hip sci-fi, but personally I find "Barbarella" more entertaining. And Vadim's film is silly, too. But not as dull as "Alphaville".In fact, I prefer the hokey Eddie "Lemmy Caution" films that were poor man's James Bond movies. Constantine was amusing at least. His "Lemmy" in "Alphaville"? Dull, dull, dull.You want to see real garbage? Check out "Sympathy for the Devil", aka "One Plus One". I love the Stones, and can put up with a fair amount of their excess. I can't put up with Godard's excess. This movie is disgusting and dull, dull, dull as retarded political statements are made by the 'auteur' and the Stones go on and on and on playing the lame slow version of what turns out to eventually be a pretty rocking song. You just keep wanting to yell at Mick and Keef: "Speed the damn thing up!"It's dull, dull, dull. I know this is supposed to be some breakthrough film of the french New Wave. Whatever. It's a snore to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>thoughts on another viewing of Breathless - it improves on repeat viewings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Breathless was a film I did not warm up to easily the first time I saw it, as it was my first film I had seen from Jean-Luc Godard, and thought it was (un-fairly) too "French". On top of that, I felt displeased with Jean-Paul Belmondo's performance. After seeing the film again, and then a third time, I still find it to not be my absolute favorite Godard, but it is a lot better film than I first remembered. Much better. In fact, it is what pretty much anyone who has praise for the movie says it is: It's one of the benchmarks of post-modernist film-making (what Godard said was accidental in "jump-cuts", evident in the fast pace of when Michel is in the car at the beginning of the film), and it is quite a good deal of fun even when it slows down and we get those long hand-held shots by Raoul Cotard. The music is catchy (I find myself whistling the theme music and some of the other music in the film), Belmondo is interesting even when he's acting like a ironic rebel (and, upon repeated viewings, Belmondo grew on me even more as I realized my initial reaction was to the punk-like quality of the character, which is of course the point), and Godard seems to be relishing in his Jazzy usage and control of the camera. It is exhilarating and I look forward to re-watching it again and again; bottom line, A Bout de soufflé was appropriately Godard's breakthrough, and on a first viewing it may turn off some more than others who aren't prepared - or, indeed, may be prepared but are too used to what Godard had already broken through with some almost 50 years ago. It does deserve a second viewing, or more, to understand it or perhaps be enthralled or whatever by it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not What Was Intended (`the French are Stupid Too`)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.This highly influential film is regarded because the director was a writer with interesting ideas and he could self-promote. As a result, a few theorists and all their legions of followers have designated this an `important film' and specifically for the reasons that Godard thought it was: reality vs documentary (portrait vs person) with a few filigrees of resulting unusual cinematography, editing and performance. It is amazing that these rather slight ideas had such power and influence forty years ago. Perhaps the slightness is an illusion because the ideas had such power they transformed our entire background.Here's another reading, one which presumes a complement to what Godard THOUGHT was the point: you can either be a thinker or an artist. If you are a thinker making a film, the film can only be as deep as your thoughts, which usually aren't. But if you are an artist, you tap into a knowing intuition, a state of communicative grace from something deeper than any maker or consumer of the artifact. So lets suppose Godard wasn't just a strong willed writer making statements like Ayn Rand writes. Lets say that this is a collection of forces that Godard responded to unknowingly and just dive into those forces. The French are obsessed with being important (or appearing to be so), especially in the arts and most especially in film. So when the overwhelming wave of (vulgar-by-definition) American influence so transforms the media away from your control, you need to strike back with matters of style. `New Wave' is to film as Perrier is to water - there's a real style here, but it is of a relatively synthetic nature.Michel Is French, trying to live as an American film star: this fact is pounded in a manner so bluntly it defaces the rest of the art. Patricia is an American trying to be French, working at several levels, sexual and intellectual. The French authorities (here conflated with the film intelligentsia) are feverously searching for Michel to eliminate creeping Americanism. Eventually, they succeed, aided by Particia. At the end Michel makes his film (the faces) and in a supreme irony, uses an American film posture to demean the `American' film experience. The American is flummoxed, in a double tragedy.My own belief is that in the grand scheme of things, this is a relatively trivial project. Godard WOULD go on to do some much more interesting, challenging and worthwhile work. I recommend `King Lear.' See that instead, unless you are a student in which case, Godard's writing will force you to see this.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Invention in narration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Breathless' is considered one of the best by Goddard and I think it is. It's a short documentary-like-film. There are parts where it becomes difficult to sit through as the conversation becomes longish or pointless but if you've watched a few films by Goddard you get used to getting bored in parts. The whole movie is a police-convict chase and nothing much happens through out the movie. There are just interesting dialogs and a good narration. Psychology of a criminal and his girlfriend is portrayed effectively by Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg The most notable aspect of this film is the detailing of each and every scene. The outside traffic noise inside an apartment, lights of moving object filtering in through windows, police chase etc looks real and interesting. 'Breathless' is also one of the initial 'New Wave' films which started the whole MTV style i.e. jump cuts, fractured sound thing. It's so weird that when you look at it you wonder what's great about the film as these things are now done by amateur film makers. It's like listening to Chuck Berry and wondering why is he is respect over Keith Richards. The reason is simple- improvisation is easier than invention for example Thakur's family massacre scene in 'Sholay' or Suneel Dutts helicopter chase scene in 'Shaan' are better than their original scenes from 'Once upon a time in the west' and 'North by Northwest' respectively because it's easier to reproduce a finished product with extra ingredients but creating a product from the scratch is difficult. 'Breathless' is an invention and will remain in the history of cinema as a path breaking invention. A must watch for a person who loves cinema as an art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How the French cinema lost its innocence...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>François Ozon,one of the most talented contemporary French directors,told once he did not care about the nouvelle vague.With notable exceptions (Demy,Malle,Chabrol),I do not either.The nouvelle vague and particularly Godard were the so called saviours of a moribund cinema.Some critics talked about the fascist arrogance of those young Turks and I can find little fault with the opinions expressed."Before us (nouvelle vague) ,there was a difference of quality between a Renoir and a Duvivier movie;now ,there's also a difference of nature" It's talking nonsense."A bout de souffle" features a plot which finds a lot of its inspiration in the American film noirs,it's not bad,but anyway,it's not the story that counts ,it's the form.But this art is pretty arty,and all that made the French cinema great:painstaking cinematography,strong screenplays,in a nutshell what made cinema magic,par excellence the show,almost everything was swallowed by the "wave" ."A bout de souffle" (breathless) was probably a metaphor of the "old hat" cinema which Godard despised.Its release had an unfortunate outcome:great directors like Duvivier and Carné were relegated to purgatory even their finest works,and the French fifties were buried ;nowadays ,critics tend to restore to favour this overlooked era.We can give the film credit for the actors:both Belmondo and Jean Seberg were excellent.But this would be milestone in cinema history is a good example of how smart artists can manipulate the crowds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Reason Not to Go to Film School</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Besides the fact that you will save $100,000 another reason to skip Film School is that you won't be required to sit through a screening of "Breathless" - a class that should be titled "How to Make a Self-Indulgent Home Movie Posing As Art" that examines what is essentially an exercise in cinematic masturbation.Okay, Godard did things differently. He not only ignored The Rules of filmmaking; he thumbed his nose at them. This may be enough to endear him to immature film students because of the rebellious nature of youth. This sentiment is usually reinforced when they learn that he is a life-long Communist, which is like, so cool! (No traditional bourgeois filmmaking principles like "Telling a Story" for Godard. How liberating!) Unfortunately, it is also the folly of youth to believe that New &amp; Different is somehow synonymous with Innovative &amp; Better - a notion has clouded the judgement of many seemingly rational people old enough to know better when it comes to their assessment of what constitutes Art. Watching early works of Godard like "? Bout de Soufflé" and "Pierrot le Fou" reminds me of a child exclaiming, Mommy, Daddy - look at me! Look at what I'm doing." Nonetheless there are actually two good reasons why you should bite the bullet (or take a stiff drink) and watch "Breathless." The first is the very 50s-ish jazzy score by Martial Solal, which totally fits the film and captures the atmosphere in the disjointed and somewhat crazy scenario (such as it is.) The second reason is the incomparable Jean Seberg. You will become captivated by her as soon as she appears on the screen, but then you will fall hopelessly in love with this utterly charming gamin Américaine when you see her slowly walking on the Champs-Elysees calling out, "New York Herald Tribune" with newspapers that she is trying to sell bundled in her arm.Godard famously said, "All that you need to make a good film is a girl and a gun." At least he was half right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Godard's audacious debut - An interesting genre-bender.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jean-Luc Godard's audacious debut is one of the films that started the French New Wave, and it has most of the directors from the New Wave associated with it - with the script written by François Truffaut and Claude Chabrol, and Jacques Rivette appearing in a cameo as the dead man on the street. Even director Jean-Pierre Melville, whose reporting style and use of real locations had a big influence on the New Wave, appears in a short scene where he's an author being interviewed by Patricia and other reporters.Though not his best, Godard's 'Breathless' is his most famous and discussed film. Even after 50 years, it hasn't lost its vitality; it's interpreted in so many different ways. We all know that most of these New Wave directors (formerly critics at 'Cahiers du Cinema') wanted to shift away from the style and rules of Classic Hollywood, which most of the mainstream French films had adapted over the years. Godard tries to break these conventions and tries experimenting with various aspects of the film. Firstly, he casts Jean-Paul Belmondo, with his punched nose and unconventional looks (though quite charming), and Jean Seberg in a boy-cut tomboyish role, introducing her wearing a T-shirt and selling newspapers on the street (an intriguing and memorable intro). With regard to Patricia's character, though intended or not, the film did have quite a feminist undertone (much different from the female characters portrayed at the time). Other than this, the film mainly comprises of random conversations and a meandering plot. All these elements went on to reinvent Modern Cinema. Godard believed that most of the mainstream films tried to seduce people with their fictional reality, tried to entertain them and make them forget the worries of their daily life; he said that's how capitalist systems kept their people happy and content. He wanted to defy establishment and authority, both in terms of film and politics; though this film is not as Marxist as his later films, it's certainly quite anarchist in nature and his contempt for capitalism is clearly visible. Just like Patricia wonders, "I don't know if I'm unhappy because I'm not free, or if I'm not free because I'm unhappy." With random jump-cuts in a single scene or characters looking/talking to the camera, Godard constantly reminds the viewer that they're watching a work of fiction, thus making us watch the film in a different light, evoking a higher level of consciousness and compelling us to interpret the film's intended meaning. He wanted to stress that none of it was real, and that the director has complete control of what's being shown on screen. The film circles-in twice (in the style of film noir), once pointing to almost nothing conspicuous (to draw the attention outside of the film), and the next time when Godard himself appears in a cameo as the informer, thus ingeniously highlighting the fact that it's Godard (the director) who's controlling the plot from within and outside of the film. Even when Michel shoots the policeman, the scene is shown in such a haphazard and unusual way; the scene is as detached from the event as the protagonist, highlighting the moral jumps he takes in the situation. Though the New Wave directors were tired of the rigid style of Classic Hollywood, they were big admirers of Film Noir. Even in this film, Godard pays homage to it in various ways, whether it's the way Michel's admires and imitates Humphrey Bogart or the random circle-ins. Michel informs his identity with the tough-guy persona of Bogart's films, and the tragedy is that even when he decides/tries to escape such a life and identity, he's still pushed along the tragic fate of characters in such crime thrillers; he's stuck within it, there's no escape. And if we analyse both our characters, we realize they have none of the usual characteristics of a film hero or anti-hero; they are quite self-obsessed, amoral, aimless, so absorbed in the world of art (Michel in cinema, Patricia in literature), yet so oblivious to the world around them. Godard tries to highlight the absurdity of life without a political, philosophical or moral commitment. The final scene is as alluring and mysterious as the rest of the film. Whether it's the statement that's said or the gesture of tracing the lips - both being carried forward and reinterpreted by different members in its chain of action. Overall, let me state that 'Breathless' isn't a great film by itself; it's not even close to the brilliance and emotional resonance of Truffaut's "The 400 Blows" or Resnais' "Hiroshima Mon Amour", New Wave works which released the previous year. Other than a few captivating scenes and dialogues, most of the film is dull and boring; I wonder how dragging the original two-and-a-half-hour runtime might have been like. But the film is important for two reasons - the way it experimented with the format opened up new possibilities in cinematic storytelling, and it's the kind of film which offers such interesting interpretations and opportunities for discussion with other cinephiles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that launched the French New Wave.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Breathless'' is 50 years old this year, and everything about the French New Wave classic has been so absorbed into the culture for so long that if you're coming to it cold ? it opens today in a richly restored print with new subtitles ? you may wonder what the revolution was about, A reminder, then: This movie liberated the cinema ? the stories you could tell and the ways you could tell them ? as clearly and cleanly as Picasso freed painting and the Sex Pistols rebooted rock. Maybe Jean-Luc Godard didn't invent the jump cut but he was the first to use it as a metaphor for life lived young; the title could apply to the editing itself. And Michel Poiccard, the petty criminal and cop-killer played by Jean-Paul Belmondo, may not have been the first antihero in movies, but he arguably was the first fashioned by the movies, his Bogart worship filling the hole where a moral man would be.Most of all, it's the beautifully unstrung pop-art poetry of "Breathless'' ? its sense of action improvised on the fly, the casual sex and casual cruelty, the movie-love evident in every frame ? that marked a decisive break with the past and helped influence a generation of Hollywood mavericks in the 1970s. The nicotine blood of this film still flows through the veins of every indie that tries to observe its characters rather than decide their fate for them.And it almost didn't happen. Godard was the most aggressive of the critical infant terribles at Cahiers du Cinema magazine and one of the last to go behind the camera. Because François Truffaut and Claude Chabrol had already made successful films, the backers of "Breathless'' demanded their input, but Truffaut's story credit and Chabrol's "technical adviser'' position were in name only. Godard got to do his thing, which was shoot wild on the streets of Paris, make up the script as he went, and initially alienate Jean Seberg, the glowing young American actress he had cast as Patricia, Michel's lover, muse, and downfall.Few understood what the director was doing, and rumors swirled through the French film industry that "Breathless'' would be the worst film of the year. No director in his right mind would film a 25-minute bedroom scene in which nothing seems to happen other than two gorgeously vibrant young people renegotiating the stakes by which they'll live, separately or together, this minute or tomorrow. Godard didn't help matters with his arrogant pronouncements: "Why do I need a story? I don't make films, I make cinema.'' Who knew he'd turn out to be right, at least for six or seven years?"Breathless'' has the bones of an unpretentious gangster thriller, the sort Godard adored and championed (he dedicated the film to Hollywood's least-respected Poverty Row studio, Monogram), and Seberg's role, if you squint right, has the shady-lady outlines of a classic femme fatale. But Patricia is also touchingly gauche in her existential dilemma ? "I'd like to think about something but I can't seem to,'' she murmurs at one point ? and what Hollywood director would score the moment in which she decides to betray her lover to Mozart's soaring Clarinet Concerto?Belmondo (a struggling young actor who became an immediate sensation thanks to his performance here) is the first great Godard hero, if different from those who'd follow: more instinctive, less intellectual, still trying to exist in the infinitely small space between the moment and the experience of the moment. Michel's offhanded comment to Patricia as they move through nighttime Paris could be the entire movie in a fractal: "Murderers murder, lovers love. Look how gorgeous the Place DOE la Concorde is tonight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out of Breath</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Still fresh as ever four viewings later, this debut feature from Jean- Luc Godard shows the acclaimed French director at his most experimental while still spinning a half decent story (the same cannot be said of all of his subsequent efforts). A key piece of dialogue crops up around halfway through as lead actress Jean Seberg tells the car thief protagonist played by Jean-Paul Belmondo that she cannot see anything beneath his face, no matter how hard she looks. Belmondo is a man who has modeled himself on the heroes of film noir (twisting his face to match Bogart's face in a photo at one point) and has lost his true identity in a near fantasy existence; Godard's inclusion of gun sound effects as Belmondo imagines firing his gun from his moving car hint at an overactive imagination. Godard's use of jump cuts is also indicative of fragmented thinking. Fascinating as this all may be, '? Bout de Soufflé' misses the mark for a top tier Godard effort. It is not even of his five best films as it does not spin as tight a narrative as something such as 'Contempt'. The scenes in Seberg's hotel room run too long and as appealing as Belmondo's non-urgency in fleeing the country may be, the film misses the opportunity for thrills and suspense. It also debatable how much sense Seberg's decision near the end makes. There is, however, no flawing the film's music, a mix of different moody styles for a mixed up world in which Belmondo feels many different emotions, and the way we get inside the mind of the film noir-influenced protagonist is superb. Godard's cameo is lots of fun too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this film was originally released, it was very revolutionary. It is also, arguably the film which started the "French New Wave" movement. It is very influential, and it has had a huge impact on cinema. I had a couple issues with it, but overall, it was a pretty impressive film, and I'm glad I watched it.After a small time car thief named Michel Poiccard shoots and kills a policeman, he reunites with a love interest named Patricia Franchini as he attempts to convince her to run away with him to Italy, all while trying to avoid the cops.This is arguably one of, if not the most influential movie of all time. It has made many contributions to cinema that have been used again and again in other movies. When it was originally shot, the filmmakers attempted to film it differently than how most films were shot. They used real locations instead of man-made sets and it was filmed in mostly natural lighting. Raoul Coutard, the cinematographer of the film, said "When we were shooting Breathless, we tried to film it the way news reports were shot, i.e., with a hand-held camera and natural lighting. In other words, for me it was very much like filming in the heat of battle." Also, since the cameras they used were very loud, Jean-Luc said the lines to them as he filmed it, and he edited their voices into the film later. These differences made it stand out from other films.However, what this film is perhaps mostly known for is its use of jump-cuts or discontinuity editing. Jean-Luc got the idea for this in director Jean Rouch's 1958 film: "Moi, un Noir". Jean-Luc was a huge fan of that film, and it's credited as a major influence for this film. However, Jean-Luc gave his own interesting twist to this concept. Instead of jumping from one scene to another, he would cut short clips out of the middle of scenes to shorten the films running time to 90 minutes instead of just removing entire scenes altogether. This caused some of the scenes to skip from moment to moment. This gave some of the scenes in the film a jagged and fast-paced feel. Essentially, what Godard did was take an already existing cinematic technique and add his own, unique style to it to spice it up or to change it around in an appealing way.Also, since Jean-Luc didn't have that big of a budget, being that this was his first film, he had to make use of what he had and try to find clever ways to cut down on cost. Godard had to film in locations that he already had access to, use cameras that he already had access to (the entire film was shot by using hand-held cameras), and he hired people he knew to help work on the film. Often, he would film on the streets of Paris without any permits. At some parts, cinematographer Raoul Coutard would film scenes while sitting in a wheelchair as he was pushed along by crew members.I've spent a lot of time discussing its influence, but now I'm going to talk a bit about what I think of its story.I thought that it was really interesting how Michel was slowly able to gain Patricia's trust as the film went on. At the same time, Patricia had to decide whether or not she should stay with him or inform the cops that she knows where they can find him. As the 2 made their way through Paris, there was always a slight amount of tension since Michel's face is everywhere in papers. Also, people often happened to be reading them when he would be going by. There are also a few scenes in which people recognized him, and he had to escape the area quickly.However, there are 2 flaws (mostly minor ones) that I had with its story.The first one is a minor complaint towards its intro. I felt like it rushed the entire intro scene when he steals the car, murders the policeman, and meets up with Patricia. It seemed very fast-paced to a point where I could hardly keep up with it. I wished for it to slow down a bit to an enjoyable pace. I was a bit worried that the entire film would be like that. Fortunately, it wasn't, but my complaint here does not vanish despite this.My second issue with the film is not as minor as the first one, but it bugged me a little bit more. This complaint is about the predictability of the films ending. After Patricia informed Michel that she did tell the cops where he lived, and that they were coming for him, it became clear to me what was going to happen next, and I was instantly able to figure out how it would end. It became obvious which direction the movie was going to head in next. I wished that they revealed it in a less obvious way than that. For example, they could've revealed it right when they were about to drive away, and the cops could show up right after that revelation. My issue might still exist in a few remnants, but it wouldn't be nearly as glaring.In conclusion, I really liked this film, and I can respect it for its huge influence on cinema history. It did many things different from most other films, and it showed that you don't have to follow any rules when writing films. I did have a couple issues with its intro and outro, but other than that, I liked everything else about the film. I can understand why it would be brought up on "best movies ever made" lists and I'd probably add it too if I made one. It has had a huge impact on cinema history, and I can respect it for what it's done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Godard in one of his best and most influential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With wonderful beginning of the French New Wave with two masterpieces (Hiroshima mon amour and The 400 Blows)it was the perfect time to Jean-Luc Godard make his debut film which is considered one of the most influential films ever made, Breathless end up to be his most famous and iconic film and with many reasons for this. A thief with tendencies of American film noir is in a constant run from the police, he reunited with an American girl he really likes to run away with him to Italy. With full of references to American noir films, Godard pays a tribute to American film noir without ever plagiarizing, the film deals with various themes and rarely goes deeper on them in a efficient but the originality and the fun that the movie brings satisfy, most of the characters are hard to relate and become quite difficult to feel something for them when something happens. The performances in total are contradictory, Jean Seberg makes a sympathetic character but selfish character and Jean-Paul Belmondo does a character that is not at all easy to relate to, but the movie doesn't focus on that, the movie focus more on greed, love, and other themes and when does it becomes a better film. It is no coincidence that the film Breathless is his most famous, and it is also one of his best film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since there have been a great many conventional reviews of this movie (far more positive than negative), I will address a criticism, that we often praise things that are groundbreaking, even when they are not that good. What, of course, is "that good"? This is by all accounts a simple story. A sociopathic young man kills a cop and feels nothing. This film pretty much made Jean-Paul Belmondo, who muscles his way through life, finding pleasure, while he is being pursued. His bad boy charm attracts the young female and she becomes embroiled in his impulsiveness. There is a love story here but there can be nothing but pain. Live fast, die young, leave a beautiful memory was created here. One could say that D. W. Griffith films are not as good as modern films on the same themes because they were silent and not in color. Even though the jump cuts and other fundamentals of filmmaking were introduced (or at least enhanced) in the French New Wave, there are those who criticize this film for being uninspired and repetitive. While it's hard to have sympathy with the two principles in this film, it does present a dizzying ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some films are simply famous without necessarily being influential, or at least not widely so. Then there are films that are not merely well known, but a significant advancement that alters cinema forever. Some of these films are artifacts that are really only worthwhile as a piece of history. Examples of this would include something like "Voyage to the Moon", which meant a lot to film history, but as a film, is so primitive as to be laughable. Then there are those works that function both as great films and significant steps in cinema. A number of silent films fall under this category, such as "Metropolis", "Cabinet of Dr Caligari", and "Nosferatu". "Breathless" falls into the later category, not only being one of the most influential films ever made, but also a truly great film.The plot, thin as it is, revolves around Michel (who takes on the look and mannerisms of Humphry Boggart) who is chased down by a cop he ends up shooting. The police are after him. We see a few scenes of the police questioning people and hunting him down, but it's not the focus of the film. Michel instead steals some money, gets together with a woman named Patricia, trying to sleep with her, then run away from her, and get the money he's owed.Much in the way Godard broke and played with the rules of cinema, so Michel makes his own rules, dictating his own pace. He knows the police are after him, and he does try to avoid them, yet he refuses to be inconvenienced. He does whatever he feels like doing at the time. Make no mistake, Michel is far from a saint. Yet it is this determination to do what means the most to him, however random it seems, or however shallow it seems, that gives "Breathless" real humanity beneath the detached way the characters act. We're watching someone who, knowing his demise could come at any moment, will make as much as he can of the time he has. Knowing that, nothing he does in this film is meaningless. Even the tiniest of things, such as him stopping to admire the humphry boggart poster, means so much more.Make no mistake, though, there's plenty else to admire about the film. The cinematography is fantastic. Using a hand-held camera and a wheelchair instead of a dolly for moving shots, we have a movie that rarely feels still. The camera is often intimately close, using only a few far away shots (often simply to establish distance between characters). The jump cuts this film is famous for are used stylistically. Even when indoors,it feels like things are in constant motion, ensuring that the film never feels slow, and even after all these years, the visual style of the film feels unique unto itself, even among the rest of Godard's filmography.Something also must be said of the dialogue. It's fast, it's snappy, topics change constantly, characters contradict themselves, make references, etc. It's certainly stylized dialogue, delivered so naturally, but this dialogue gives the film sheer entertainment value. There's just something about watching the conversations unfold that is hypnotic, almost a thing of poetry. The apartment scene in particular I rate as one of the greatest scenes in cinema.As a piece of history, "Breathless" is equally fascinating. While an argument could be made about what the best french new wave film is (there's certainly steep competition in that department, "The 400 Blows" and "Pickpocket" as two examples), "Breathless" is the defining one. The film, more than any other, that gave a sense of freedom to film makers everywhere, showing they didn't have to limit themselves to a rigid narrative structure. The jump cuts also, of course, were a huge innovation and have been used to the point of almost tedium throughout cinema ever since. There's certainly more to say on the historical side, but I don't want this to get too long.The casual viewer will likely have a tough time with this one. Unlike relatively straightforward french new wave like the before mentioned "400 Blows", "Breathless" is abstract and likely to leave the unprepared viewer bored, confused and dismissive. I warn you do not go into this movie expecting a thriller, or a film that is in anyway conventional. This is a film where characters waste time,conversations go nowhere and last a long time, and the plot is the least relevant thing occurring for 95% of the movie.I know, that sounds awful, and in the hands of someone else, "Breathless" would be a worthless train wreck of a movie on par with the works of Uli Lommel. Yet in the hands of "Godard", it is a mesmerizing film experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jean-Luc Godard is one of the French New Wave directors who, as critics in the 1950s, had been regular contributors to the influential publication "Cahiers Du Cinema". As a group, they were disenchanted with the output of the French film industry at that time and believed that by putting the director at the centre of the creative process and dispensing with traditional narrative conventions, a far more imaginative style of filmmaking could be achieved. In his first film, Godard sought to achieve this by a variety of means which included, borrowing from some earlier cinematic styles that he admired.In "Breathless" ("A Bout De Soufflé"), a simple film noir plot is presented in a style that owes much to the influence of the Italian Neo-Realists (e.g. filming on location, use of hand-held cameras and improvised dialogue). Additionally, by using unorthodox techniques such as "jump cuts" and getting characters to look directly into the camera and then injecting the action with great pace, the result is a movie that looks vibrant, spontaneous and highly energetic.At the time of its release, few could have imagined the impact that "Breathless" would have on filmmaking in general or the profound influence it would subsequently have on numerous directors such as John Cassavetes, Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino.Michel Poiccard (Jean-Paul Belmondo) is a small-time criminal who after stealing a car in Marseilles and killing a motorcycle cop, makes his way to Paris to collect some money that he's owed and reunite with one of his girlfriends called Patricia Franchini (Jean Seberg). Patricia's an American student who has aspirations to become a journalist and earns some money by selling the "New York Herald-Tribune" on the Champs Elysees. Michel wants to escape to Italy as soon as he can collect his money and wants Patricia to go with him but she tells him that she can't leave Paris for financial reasons.Michel spends his time in Paris sharing Patricia's hotel room and the couple talk a great deal about life and love whilst Michel also tries relentlessly to seduce her. Despite the seriousness of his crimes, Michel seems very unconcerned about the situation he's in and if he does feel desperate, certainly hides it well beneath a façade of being super-cool. He's totally amoral and an inveterate thief but is also very preoccupied with trying to emulate the mannerisms of his hero, Humphrey Bogart.Patricia is a cold character who's fascinated by Michel's lifestyle but always remains emotionally detached even when they seem to be at their closest. Things get increasingly complicated for Michel as the police manhunt intensifies but eventually matters are brought to a head by a simple action that's incredibly casual, uncaring and self-serving.French New Wave directors Francois Truffaut, Claude Chabrol and Jean-Pierre Melville all contributed in different ways to the making of this movie and Alain Resnais' "Hiroshima Mon Amour" (1959) is just one of a whole collection of other films and filmmakers that are referenced. Amusingly, Michel's alias in the movie is Laszlo Kovacs and he also uses some of Humphrey Bogart's photos outside a cinema that's showing "The Harder They Fall" (1956) to perfect his attempt to look and act as much like Bogey as possible.In retrospect, it's no exaggeration to describe "Breathless" as a masterpiece because its exhilarating combination of originality, freshness and sheer enthusiasm was genuinely revolutionary when it was made and it became an incredibly rich source of inspiration to other filmmakers in the years that followed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Atypical Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking a lot of chances technically, Breathless is a breathed new life into French film that would eventually lead to American filmmaking. Breathless still can be recognized as an innovative, fresh, and even fun film about a tragic and complicated love. All the while watching Breathless, I couldn't help but think of Bonnie and Clyde every minute that passed. Though, not the same plot, the two films click with many of the same strengths.The direction and cinematography allows for some beautiful shots, I particularly enjoyed the scenes that featured smoke exiting the actor's mouths. With the black and white film stock, it captures something poetic and rich about the story. Breathless is most famous for the unusual editing: the controversial jump cuts. I think the style meshed well with the rapid pace of the plot itself. The editing strips down the necessities of the story and that's what we get in the final film.The jump cuts highlighting the important moments of the plot say something profound about the relationship of the lead couple. There's a rather long scene in the middle section of the film, that features the two actors just talking. They develop this romance as the heart of the picture. It's not the typical Hollywood gushing love story, but breaks free from the expected. As human beings, we're all different, therefore when we connect with another, it will b different. Each relationship will be rare and its own. The romance here is atypical, but so thrilling to see was broadcast for the world to see.There feels like a layer of cinematography was cut in Breathless. It knows that's its a film, but it acts more personal than how other movies are shown to us. Another layer that's cut is the wall between the movie world and the real world with the references of Hollywood. I quite enjoyed the performances from Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg, they embody characters who don't conform to society morally or ethically. They can easily steal a car and it's no big deal. These actions aren't segmented to feel weird, they feel natural to the characters, therefore they feel natural to us.Rating: 10Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doing well to leave the medium of cinema, in fact, Breathless; Godard's film packs a dramatic punch on top of an intuitive one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose, for all its bravado and reputation within the department of revolutionising a genre; a movement; a generation; etc. - Godard's "Breathless" is often as involving as it is out of its central relationship between a man and a woman ? something you might say is as old as anything else in cinema. That said, it isn't difficult to see the influence littered throughout the film. From subtle moments involving characters and props to distinct, visual flourishes via the editing and such, the film is almost certainly an experience in a historical context. Looking beyond this, and the reputation that precedes it, the film is an involving tale of a young hood and his girl, of which the relationship is refreshingly built on an unrequited fondness more-so a romantic one, who strives to escape the country on account of being a wanted criminal. Had the approach and aesthetic applied not been as historically significant, therein remains a healthy idea about a character on the run whose tale mostly remains engaging. Jean-Paul Belmondo plays Michel, a young criminally minded loner whose fondness for cars and self-confession that he sees himself as a bit of an unlikeable renegade does not immediately invite us to like him upon entrance to his world. When we ride with him in a car that he's hotwired, Godard knowingly places us into the automobile itself as we're riding along with him ? it's a position we're uncomfortable with as he dictates his thoughts to us during the cruise. Michel is a man with a plan ? a man with money and a woman on the mind ? initially needing to find someone from whom he may attain a large amount of money owed so as to start a new life, and then that woman with whom he desires to start said new life. To an extent, Michel is representative of the braver, more dynamic French cinema people such as Godard induced through complaints via their writings for so long. Here is a man, and a national movement, that are confrontative; a duo who are both very different and yet are being asked for audience backing. They are more outgoing, more carefree and explorative who perhaps don't necessarily care what you think of them: anything to break the monotony. There is an amusing instance when Michel quite literally squares up to a photograph of Humphrey Bogart outside a cinema, this idea of a French street punk played by somebody you've probably not heard of matching a Hollywood icon's expression, as if they were equal in stature, epitomises this. After there is a snag in the attaining of the money, that woman Michel said he was going after rears up in the form of Patricia (Seberg), an American who sells newspapers on the streets of Paris. Disaster strikes when, en route to meet these errands, he is stopped by a police officer over the stolen car ? Michel ends up gunning him down and fleeing. Finding Patricia, we are perhaps surprised at her resisting the advances ? a lesser film may have had her agree somewhat quickly before depicting their leaving for where Michel wants to flee. When Michel remains, therefore, stuck in Paris there boils a sense of frustration out of our lead and the film itself being unable to 'advance' ? a veering away from populist means when cause and effect may have kicked in and we'd be on the road already.We come to wonder how it was either of them ever got together. We discover Patricia's fondness for being very precise in the number of nights they spent together; we sense it meant something to her whereas for Michel, the man is unable to recall why it was a previous marriage even ended. An informed, philosophical girl ? she earns what she earns through her modest newspaper job where the sly criminal Michel is to be on the brink of what appears to be a large cash sum in spite of his essentially evil nature. In spite of its revolutionary aura and attitude, the bare-boned story is an exercise in terrific drama and platonic fondness anyway. We observe Michel desire Patricia, Patricia come to reject Michel ? a man who often gets what he wants, often able to take what he wants, this dynamic of lust for another woman combined with the pride in potentially having her conflicts throughout with the inherent danger he's in on account of being wanted for a murder. The film's inspiration is unparalleled, a meagre example one can offer might be in the form of a scene in Guy Ritchie's 2000 film "Snatch", wherein Jason Statham's character lists to his accomplice the means of Hare coursing across a series of cuts, each of them set about half a mile apart in three very different locations. What should have taken barely sixty seconds to explain has been stretched across a handful of jump cuts using the two-shot as a means to induce the 'jump' cut. Godard's film is energetic, involving and well-paced as the elements close in and Michel cannot sort his priorities out; one could recommend it as a piece of drama just as easily as one could a cinematic footnote.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Breathless is a film by Jean-Luc Goddard, a French realist who jumpstarted the New Wave French Movement (a topic of which I am ignorant but am aware of its poignant impact on cinema in general). French society has spawned some of the greatest artists, and quite frankly, look around. The dazzling coffee shops, the architecture of Paris, the salient Eiffel Tower, and the picturesque scenery are all examples that reflect the artistry that is driven by these people. Breathless, a film made at the start of exploitation in 1960, effectively makes a statement about the ever changing world and about French artistry at its finest.The film's story was conceived by Francois Truffaut who directed Les Quatre cents coups. Truffaut has a talent for realism behind the silky black &amp; white; Breathless is a successful experimentation of that. It is edited and directed in a contemporary quick-cut style that inevitably reminded me of David Fincher and Martin Scorsese. And while cinema has progressed in precision, Breathless yields a distinctive filmmaking style that is totally endearing.The film is borderline style over substance, but I'm thankful that the collaboration between Truffaut and Goddard found a solid equilibrium. It follows an impetuous scoundrel named Michel Poiccard. Michel is a self-described "A-hole". This argument gives him reason to exude little to no remorse for the people around him. It also permits him to take life as easily as possible. He's a ramshackle character who steals francs and cars like he's switching cigarettes. The accessories may always change, but not Michel. Goddard makes a vivid point early in the film where Michel stumbles outside of an American cinema, mumbling "Bogie's" name as he lights a cigarette and fumbles at his lips, as if in a reverie. These idiosyncrasies are not innate but influenced by Western cinema. Michel has seen one too many movies as he dodges the cops, crassly handles women and carelessly occupies the lives of others.One such life is a young multilingual journalist named Patricia. Michel tantalizes and lusts after her. Maybe it's because she's fluent in different languages. Maybe it's because she's pretty, but Patricia denies this cosmetic cause, citing Michel to have lusted after dozens of prettier women. I think it's because she's an American. The unscrupulous cad tries cross-culturing Patricia with his frank cynicism and constant swindles. Patricia is wooed, but only so slightly. Her knowledge of French culture is limited to a learned education of Chevalier and Lafayette. Maybe it's Michel's outlandishness that attracts her. She remains on the defensive for the duration of the film, often succumbing to his riley charms before making a detrimental decision in the end. (By the way, that scene elapses in a photography studio. Can the French get any more artistic?). The lovers are unusually paired, but effective in this case. The male is a Westernized Frenchman, the woman is a French-influenced American. They are from opposite spectrums of their own cultures but uniformly alike when they are together. For that, I commend the writing.Breathless is a mural of jazz, sex and crime, served with an artistic twist and finished with a photogenic ambiance. As the Criterion release put it, "There is before Breathless and after Breathless." The movie has the power to move cinema?since 1960 it has taken our breath away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Godard's Classic Contribution to Hollywood Culture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Jean-Luc Godard and written by Francois Truffaut, Breathless was Godard's first feature-length work, and one of the earliest, most influential of the French New Wave movies. The literal French translation, ? bout de soufflé, meaning "at breath's end", makes more sense as the film comes to a close. As well as heralding the New Wave genre, Breathless gives a heartfelt nod to American crime movies with Jean-Paul Belmondo as Michel Poiccard, a would-be gangster, pridefully modelling himself on Humphrey Bogart, assuming his mannerisms and adopting a devil-may-care attitude at all times.After shooting a policeman, Michel goes on the run (but not really a desperate run - he's too 'cool' for that ), turning to his American girlfriend, Patricia Franchini, played by Jean Seberg, for intimacy, money, and support in dodging the police. Michel comes across as a somewhat misogynistic, selfish, narcissistic, nihilistic young man who seems to care little for the results of his actions and yet there is a subtle vulnerability and sadness about his bravado and one gets the strong sense that he is still 'searching for himself'; his cutting remarks and cynicism perhaps covering up his basic insecurity. Jean makes an excellent counterpart in that, while appearing to be in love with Michel, wants to foster her own independence and not be 'dependent on a man'. There is much to love about this very 'French' film, including the classic silences after one or other of the lovers has declared something fairly life changing e.g. Patricia telling Michel she is pregnant and him retorting (after a lengthy silence) that he needs to make a phone call, or go see someone. Michel and Jean are in love but, for both, it is sometimes more of a nuisance rather than an exhilaration; Michel's feelings are neatly summed up when he says to a friend "and to make matters worse I love her".Jean-Luc Godard's tribute to Hollywood and American culture is groundbreaking and the casual promiscuity and crime risqué for the times. The fun, jazzy soundtrack, quick camera cuts and deliberately unpolished cinematography create a certain sense of urgency as well as 'lightness' as Michel ducks and dives to avoid being caught. Apparently Godard used plenty of improvised script throughout and this 'stream of consciousness' gives it a 'breathless ' feel. Michel's character puts one in mind of an 'angry young man' or a 'rebel without a cause', the end of his crime spree being poignant and pointless. It is the end of the movie that I liked least but I suppose it was inevitable and even cleverly ironic as Michel had voiced his disgust with 'cowards' throughout the film. I would recommend 'Breathless' as it is truly unique, inventive, radical and influential and certainly a grand achievement for a first time Director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to film the difference: Godard, take one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jean-Luc Godard's "Breathless" has all the hallmarks of ground-breaking Nouvelle Vague cinema and definitely was not what people were used to in the early Sixties. Which was the point. Fed up with "tradition of quality", of studios producing the same established, reliable, money-making pictures over and over again, Godard as one of the rebells against the establishment makes a film with broad strokes that resolutely goes against the tide. As the director's very first feature it's a distinctive exclamation mark of a new beginning era, shakes things up, in every way fresh and different. Part of Godard's revolutionary crime drama are also Nouvelle Vague combatants like Truffaut (story), Coutard (cinematography), Melville (director in acting role) and Chabrol (as technical adviser). The cast was no less audacious: while one of the leads was up and coming (Jean-Paul Belmondo), the other one had only experienced failures in the US (Jean Seberg) and the whole thing could only be shot on a shoestring. Nevertheless or because of all that the movie stands solid as a rock in its defiance of conventions, is bold and innovative, raw and experimental. The film strikes new paths how to depict the unhinged protagonists' way of lives, embeds a criminal and his insecure girlfriend in an overtly realistic scenario with mundane situations, peppered by sharp dialog and the famous jump cut editing. With all these parameters "Breathless" feels loose, cool and very French. It lives from its contradictions, by exploring the space in between: It's a noir that is not a noir, a love story that cannot decide if it wants to be one, an exercise in unprecedented style at any rate, a film with a new feel to it. Not everything works, as would be the case in subsequent Godard films, but in this case the picture's very distinct artistic character makes up for it.</fullReview>

Well, it was a nice little film, very revolutionary for the time and not what I would expect but also nothing really that impressive, IMO, I was disappointed given its ultra high rating in the Sign and Sound poll (ranked the 11th greatest movie of all time!). Overall, I found it an interesting example of history of film and it shows how much modern films have been influenced by French cinema in the 1960's but it wasn't exactly something that made me feel "greatness" such as I felt watching, for instance, 2001: A Space Odyssey, another favorite of these polls. In fact I have watched hundreds of more powerful films than this one, which fells quite outdated half a century later.</fullReview>

Godard' ? bout Der soufflé, 1960, starring distinctly expressed the new wave style, and incorporated quotations from several elements of popular culture ? specifically American filmmaking. The film employed various innovative techniques such as jump cuts, character asides, and breaking the rules in continuity editing. Truf co-wrote Breathless with Godar and introduced dotard to the producer who ultimately funded the film, Goard viewed film making as an extension of criticism and was more interested in redefining film structure and style than actually being understood by the public. Often his movies were more about the presentation of a story than anything else. The stories in his films were very simple yet unfocused and constantly digressing from the main story line. From the beginning of his career, Go included more film references into his movies than any of his Wave colleagues. In Breathless, his citations include a movie poster showing Humph</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this is a great film,i recommend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite films for many reasons. It is the story of Michel (Jean Paul Belmondo), a common car thief, who becomes a wanted man for killing a police officer on his way back to Paris after stealing a car. But the main story revolves around him trying to get Patricia (Jean Seberg), an American girl who works in Paris and goes to the Sorbonne, to run away to Rome with him.CinematographyThe hand-held camera movement is natural with well-planned shorts in a grainy yet still sharp black and white exposure. This film has interesting lighting and usage of camera angles and segment cuts. Breathless has a good balance and contrast between black and white, and shows a true and loving feel for Paris, similar to what Woody Allen's Manhattan did for New York.WritingThe script has great comedic banter between the leading characters as well as perfectly placed short encounters throughout with secondary actors for both Belmondo and Seberg. ActingAll the roles are well performed, especially the those of Belmondo and Seberg whose characters play off each other perfectly. Belmondo plays the quintessential bitter yet funny French alpha male to the tee, while Seberg defines the cute and witty American girl in Paris.MusicThe film is nicely scored without too much music, which can sometimes be overwhelming in films. The score has a nice feel for the music of the noir films of the 40's with more new wave methods of cutting the tracks.OverallThis is one of my favorite films of all times because of its simple story and visual appeal. I give this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good debut of Godard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was projected in my high school in 2011 but i wasn't really interested to watch it, i only decided to watch it some months after when i realized it was an emblem of the "Nouvelle Vague" and a big classic of french cinema.The movie is about Michel Poiccard, a young criminal who steal a car and kill a policeman and will try to go to Italy with a girl. First thing i notice, the camera moves a lot and it's pretty trembling. It's the proof of the first feature film of Godard. I liked the soundtrack of the movie which is pretty jazz.Many quotes are outstanding in this film like "When the French say a second, they mean five minutes." or "If you don't like the sea... or the mountains... or the big city... then get stuffed!"It was the first movie of Godard i watched and i liked it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breathless is less than breathtaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jean Luc Godard apparently 'exploded' onto cinematographic centre stage with 'Breathless', labelled the fore-runner of French cinema new wave. 50 years on its hard to see what the fuss is all about.The film operates in two distinct temporal dimensions: the beginning and end segments are fast paced and furious, sandwiching in between the requisite French moody dwelling on life discourse shared through a fog of cigarette smoke, enigmatic glances and languid stretches on an unmade bed. Which is what the main protags Michel and Patricia seem to do for a fair chunk of the film.The opening sequence sees Michel travel down Goddard's favourite road in France (the exact same one he features prominently later in the Weekend), a tree lined asphalt cut through sun scorched flat plane. Michel attracts the notice of police for a minor traffic violation and decides the best course of action is step on the pedal and play chase. When a cop does eventually catch up with him, Michel pulls out a pistol and shoots him dead. All of this transpires within five or so minutes, and I'm left wondering: but why? Why? Who does this? Why shoot the cop for nothing and bring down the long arm of the law on yourself? Well, my dear, I can hear Godard saying, we've got to start this movie somehow or other, just go with the flow, cherish the 'rebel without a cause' style of Michel.Next up, Michel meets up with American Patricia, whom he's known for three weeks and seems to have fallen for. Patricia stumble-bumbles about in her Twiggy hairdo, bobby socks and long pleated skirt and her poor French accent which we are blessedly spared from overuse, as she tends to be monotonic, mostly saying things such as 'I don't know', or 'Its all the same thing'. A blander non character I've never seen. What Michel sees in her remains a mystery, both to him and frankly to me. Patricia does, however, have some sort of avante-guarde visage for a 1960 film: she seems to be a slut, through and through, which would have been novel for the time. I can't figure out if making her an American slut wasn't a political machination on Godard's part: in order to spare the 'purity' of French girls? In any event, as Patricia reels off various conquests, I'm doing mental calculations; when did the Pill debut? Surely it wasn't around in 1960? How does Patricia get away with it, then? Well, she doesn't, it turns out. She's pregnant. Not entirely sure who the father is, but most likely candidate is Michel. Oh, and puffing on ciggies non stop. Maybe they didn't know back then?....Now follows the bed scene. God, the French love their bed mis en scenes, remember 'My Night at Maude's' here. An hour of rolling around on the bed, chain smoking and trying to be brazen about love, life and everything under the sun. Just as I felt my eyes beginning to glaze over, the gruesome twosome finally decided to get out of bed and hit the Champs Elyzee, which is always a treat to see through out the ages as it were. Michel finds out he is a wanted man by the police, so he decides to run for it: next port of call: Italy. Can Patricia please come with him? No, Patricia can not. She likes all the bad boy antics, but when it comes down to it, she's going to marry some straight and narrow guy, live in a house with a white picket fence and have 2.2 children.All fine and good, but why, oh why does she have to call the police and give Michel away? This seemed an unnecessary tactic. Michel refuses to run because, he says, he is tired. Again, incongruous and out of character for him. He is in his early twenties and has so far displayed a casual devil may care attitude to life. How did he get tired all of a sudden? Is Godard in a rush to wrap things up and so throws everything into a one pot Massala for a grande denouement? Yes, he does. Grande ending ensues within next five minutes with gun shots and Michel prostrate in the 'foothills' of the Eiffel Tower, making funny faces at his beloved. In a rather powerful finale gesture he closes his own eyes pre-mortem and expires on cue for brilliant theatrical effect.Still, what the hell just happened here, apart from a Frenchified homage to Bonnie and Clyde? Godard is so much better later on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Breath of Fresh Air</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Godard's Breathless not only ushered in the nouvelle vague movement but also, arguably, the 1960s. The film truly captures the coolness, daring and unconventional approach to art that was to define that decade forever.Given that, in France alone, the era was to see the end of the de Gaulle government, the 1968 student riots and the end of the horrific war in Algeria, the nouvelle vague was prescient in reflecting the upheaval to come and questioning the established order.Godard famously uses jump-shots throughout this film, drawing attention to the fact that the film is not a reflection of the real, that it is a contrived piece of art and that he, as director, is making editorial decisions. it also reflects the rapid, sometimes chaotic pace of life in the modern city and behind the wheel of powerful, modern automobiles.The hand-held cameras and filming in the streets lend a sense of immediacy and the references to Bogart link the film to the gangster dramas of the past. Here, the reference is half-tribute, half-parody. The Belmondo character seeks to emulate the characters Bogart plays but knows he can never be as "cool" as he perceives Bogart to be in his mind. Likewise, his insistence on stealing American cars instead of French vehicles suggests a worship of the new consumerist culture being imported from the United States that is all about facades - American appears cool though it is not. It is the land of consumer aspirations so Belmondo steals cars to satiate the desire it instills in the black market customers yet he cannot keep any car for long. He must continually try what is novel and new, just as consumerism drives people to acquire more and more goods.Godard himself is, of course, the infant terrible of French cinema. Here he takes all of the lessons learned during his years as a Cahier critic and systematically rejects them, creating something wholly new in the process. As with modern artists though, he is part-genius and part-fraud and the line between the two is often blurred. The film is as much about drawing attention to the director and establishing his profile as it is about a standalone work of art.This, then is the moment when the artist embraces celebrity culture, much like Warhol was to do in America.Established ideas are subverted playfully and frustratingly throughout. The notion that dialogue should have a point and either develop the themes of the story, the plot or lend insight into the characters is subverted by a pointless half-hour long conversation that goes nowhere.Seberg's character is a mixture of femme fatale and naive fool by turns, ultimately turning on her lover out of confused curiosity instead of a sense of righteousness or for gain. The notorious ending with its misheard dialogue subverts any idea of a neat conclusion and reinforces the vacuousness nature of the artificial, constructed character.The interview scene with the famous writer again reinforces the notion that this is half-fraud, half-genius. His replies to the journalists' questions are by turns profound and flippant.Ultimately, though, it is the film's energy and atmosphere that set it apart. After the static, stage-bound films of the mid-1950s, here is something that embodies the zeitgeist. The energy, grittiness, fast-pace and fluid, hand-held cameras stand in stark contrast to static, moribund efforts like the 1955 version of Nana by Christian-Jaque. The energy of the film reflects the Belmondo character's largely devil-may-care nature that makes him stay with the girl when logic tells him he should flee Paris.Ultimately, this film broke new ground in what was possible and allowed smaller, independent film-makers to dare experiment without the backing of large studios. It expanded the grammatology of film-making by introducing new techniques and applying old ones in new ways. It also ushered in the era of the auteur as stamping his or her own vision on a film irrespective of commercial pressures or studio politics and led to a revitalisation of the art form as a whole, setting France on a distinctive new path away from the purely commercial style being wholeheartedly embraced in Hollywood and England. It is part-genius, part-fraud but a unique breath of fresh air all the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very interesting and entertaining film. The camera work is very peculiar and difficult. I wonder how Godard actually managed to pull off the very long takes in this film. His direction is very great in my opinion.Also, the editing is very flashy and also interesting. Look at this fantastic work in the car scene, as an example. There is another great scene, in the very beginning of the film, where the couple is chatting, and in my opinion that scene is perhaps the best of the film. It is a nightmare for those who are lovers of the traditional edited film, and a masterpiece for those who have an open mind and real taste for cinema.The story itself is simple, there is a lot of symbolisms and subtle meanings, commentaries about society...is very interesting. And aesthetically is great, I also liked the calm jazz soundtrack... Is an all around excellent film. Can't complain.</fullReview>

The style of having the script evolve as the film went along was a brave move in its day, and that it turned out so well deserves recognition. Godard said the success of Breathless was a mistake. He added "there used to be just one way. There was one way you could do things. There were people who protected it like a copyright, a secret cult only for the initiated. That's why I don't regret making Breathless and blowing that all apart."I am also glad that Jean Seberg stars, because this has to be her greatest role. Before she became a target of the FBI and died prematurely, she had a lot of potential and could have gone down as one of the greats -- and among her great roles, this is the greatest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Homage to classic American cinema and great example of innovative European cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though, the chances are slim that anyone ever reads this review, especially when they are hundreds of reviews already out there, it seemed necessary to express enthusiasm once more and to add one or more previously neglected detail. It is OK to watch this film in bed on a small b/w TV. But whether or not you chose such a nostalgic setting, it is definitely OK to watch it a hundred times. The film is about style. It breaks rules and surprises us with fresh editing. It delivers an atmosphere which is hard to beat. Do not make the mistake to believe the protagonists are seducing each other. They are solely seducing you. The naturalness of the famous bedroom talk is a performance. It is,however, a performance which is particularly enticing because of its off-beat naturalness. By the end of the film at the latest it becomes clear who is ultimately addressed: Jean Seberg looks directly into your eyes. The story of the mysterious women is repeated once again but expressed strangely and beautifully by Jean Seberg. Whereas the hard-boiled gangster turns out to be a shallow copy of the romantic hero represented in western cinema, the heartless and mysterious femme fatale embodies the audience par excellence: she does not only watch the hero's actions with detachment, she also repeats his gestures, she constantly asks questions and then finally she turns to you for answers. Thus, ultimately the film is not about gangsters or femmes fatales but about cinema itself. It pays homage to the classic American cinema and provides at the same time the best example of innovative European cinema. It deconstructs former cinematic rules and accelerates breathlessly with innovation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give 'Breathless' a 10 out of 10 because it is simply unlike any movie I have ever seen in my life. The plot can be described in a sentence. Jean Paul Belmondo shoots a police officer and decides to run away with a girl he likes, Jean Seberg. The film isn't about plot however. The plot only provides a backbone for scenes that seem so spontaneous, it's incredible that they were scripted.Godard here turns a film into something that is not a film, something that is not real life, he turns it into something....indescribable. The film is so fresh and innovative, even today it stands as a landmark of cinema. I am not sure how to convince you to watch this film.

Well another "ministere de la culture" subsidized French movie my 14 years old son could have made. And would not be proud of. Mostly it is about the fragility of modern conjugal love, in contrast to ancient Penelope's fidelity to Odysseus. The subplot concerning the conflict between film as art and film as profitable investment hardly enters into the picture. There are some good French movies, most of them out of the subsidized financing circuit, but they naturally get bad critiques. For some enlightened moviegoers, seems that European means sleek, and boring European means intellectually superior sleek.Guess what, boring is just boring.</fullReview>

Maybe it started in me a liking for different cinema languages, other than the American system of audiovisual representation. A few years later, Godard shot in 1959 "? bout de soufflé", a motion picture that had a strong impact on me: I did not know what was going on, with so many new elements before my eyes, like the jump cuts during a car ride, the long sequence with Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg in a hotel room, or the last tracking shot when Belmondo is running for his life and Seberg acquires his gestures. Now I know that it was a groundbreaking film, that Godard was revolutionizing the art of editing, but for me it was an introduction to a Brechtian approach in narrating events. It is still one of my all-time favorite movies, and now I recognize its influences in many films of its time, like Richard Lester's films with The Beatles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Boute de Soufflé aka Breathless was one of the first foreign films I watched after I decided to watch films 'properly', back in 2003/4. A friend back then found it a bit ridiculous, even amateurish. I liked it then and parts lodged in my brain and I ached to see it again and prove my friend wrong.As part of the Jean Luc Goddard collection, it whistled through its 90 minutes runtime in what seemed like half that ? its freshness and that 'amateurishness' that my friend had harped on about was then, a new approach to filmmaking ? cut editing, which adds dynamism and vigour. The absolutely audacious lead crosses Bonnie &amp; Clyde with Malcolm Mc Dowell in A Clockwork Orange ? I can only see Mr Mc D being any sort of alternative actor that could have pulled it off. As the flash harry Michel, Jean-Paul Belmondo is utterly superb and convincing. Jean Seberg as his American, flight attendant date that he sets out to impress. I read a reviewer (amateur) who moaned that the hotel bedroom scene was boring and wishy-washy where nothing happened. But that's the point and beauty of it and makes it the best part. Anyone who's spent aimless afternoons in the semi AND intimate company of a potential or actual lover, just knows that inane and meaningless chatter that goes on and that being was so brilliantly written and naturally acted. He just occasionally says 'get your top off' whilst she organises his life, her life and everyone's life around him ? he just lies in bed smoking ? she goes about and does 'things', possibly useful, or otherwise.....The gritty underbelly of the world's most Romantic city with petty crime and petty characters and the audacious thriller scenes remind of the original British Scarface (set in Brighton) and of course, the French heist movies of this time, pioneered by such as Bob de Flambeur from Jean Pierre Melville (who actually has a small part in this). Back then, fifty years ago and so singularly French (&amp; since much replicated by/in Hollywood). All in all, an absolute cutting-edged, scathingly scorching social thriller of refreshing naturalness. I can see a Scorsese-ness coming out of those brooding, angry and powerful scenes and characters.Think you've seen all the best and most influential films? Not without this one, you haven't!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gets the Creative Impulses Going</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Countless excellent films are classics. Some prevail as milestones. The meagerest handful, in an objective historical sense, merit being termed innovations. This truly visceral rush of a movie goes unmistakably on one of those fingers you'd count on one hand in the last group. Godard committed the film to the cut-rate gangster B pictures that this somewhat satirical urban drama was bringing into play and completely aping. Jean-Paul Belmondo plays Michel, a petty thief who kills a highway cop. Although in retreat to Rome, he stops in Paris and hooks up with his sometime girlfriend Patricia, a sexy American tomboy whose glamour is her detached flightiness. As they talk, make love and unenthusiastically evade the police, Godard reveals them to be the sort of young people that the movies had never before portrayed, bustling in the here and now, unmindful of traditional ethics, desperate to affect views and approaches to life like a fashion style. Theirs is an inborn existentialism, and Godard's leading actors make it just about hopelessly relatable.Lean and physical, Belmondo became an international star by seizing Michel's disarming fusion of weakness and bandit bluster. Godard at one time had the same enthusiasm, but he's not over-romantic about it. As played by Jean Seberg, Patricia is a star-spangled cat, a memorable intermingling of idol and priss, a fitting image for the next generation's possibilities and duplicity. Truffaut wrote the basic plot line and hardly gets sufficient recognition for its neat, sly effortlessness.But what makes this 87-minute generation-maker ground-breaking comes not from dense cerebral matters but from Godard's off-hand impulsiveness, a carefree attitude of winging it that cheerfully foils what's exhausted in previous movies. While Godard knew that fugitive outlaw flicks could no longer be played square, he knew that the dominant notions of qualified craftsmanship, formal visual compositions, basic editing, had become a confinement, a manner of blinding us to the possibilities of capturing the world. Cinema was the slave children in the Temple of Doom, and Godard was Indiana Jones. Truffaut was Short Round, at heart at least.The movie's most outrageous practice at the time is its abundant use of jump cuts, a consciously raucous cutting technique that Godard uses to induce urban life's dashing, shuddering pulse. Georges Melies is credited as the minister of the jump cut on account of having done it accidentally, only then using it as sleight-of-hand. This, I think, could be why Godard would use such a technique, because it feels and seems so purely accidental that it gives the work that blunt boost of candidness. Captivated by the modern city as it's truly lived in, he hurls Raoul Coutard's inimitable camera through dumpy, practically closet-size apartments and swarming streets, engulfing us in the disorderly spin of a modern world where everything ultimately rear-ends: Michel and Patricia's pseudo-melodrama bursts into a presidential procession on the Champs Elysees, and movie posters toss out an sardonic interpretation of the romance-famished souls of those passing them by.No other director had ever before harmonized Godard's sense of the indefinable grain of the modern, particularly his incisive recognition that many of our key experiences now came through the media. While this is unmistakably the situation with Patricia, who interviews novelists, cites from Faulkner and even vends the New York Herald Tribune, it's more critically true of Michel, whose code of honor comes directly from B-movies. There may be no more revealing moment in any '60s movie than Michel gazing at a picture of Humphrey Bogart and insecurely running his thumb across his lips just like Bogey, or how contagious this gesture becomes. Even outside of the film, shortly after it initially emerged, not only were millions imitating Belmondo's own gestures but filmmakers started to emulate Godard. His tracks are noticed in everything from Bonnie and Clyde to Scorsese and Coppola to today's somewhat deluded music videos and TV commercials.After this witty, deadpan milestone, Godard created a stream of movies that may be the greatest epoch of uninterrupted deconstructive innovation in movie history, whether I like them all or not. Nonetheless, the knack of this rhythmic, affecting masterwork seizes the cadences and mercilessness of city life, the trouble-free corruption of youthful impulsiveness, the despondent blind alley of male-female dealings, the fated idealism of those raised on old movies. Arguably the most mutinous of innovative films, Breathless is also the most crisp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>? Bout De Soufflé follows Michel Poiccard, a car thief that goes by the name of Laszlo Kovacs, in his relationship with an American girl in Paris, as he escapes from the police and tries to get the money a friend owes him. Regarded as one of the most important and influential films in history, it has its fame well achieved. In the same year that William Wyler shot Ben-Hur, Jean-Luc Godard invented modern cinema with ingenious angles, hand-held camera, jump cuts, natural dialogue and an emphasis in the relationships between the characters more than in the actual plot.Godard takes a typical film noir plot to criticize both the amorality of his generation and the obsession of many young people to be like their heroes of the screen. Although the film is a landmark and a symbol of French cinema, the theme of the couple escaping from justice is now seen as a cliché of American cinema. Actually, the whole film has some American feel to it, and that's the proof of its gigantic influence.Aside of all of its artistic genius, the film is also surprisingly entertaining and appealing to a conventional audience. There is a sequence that lasts for thirty five minutes in which they're basically talking in bed, and this scene plays of with engaging and natural dialogue and overall feels like just ten minutes have passed, and by looking at the ending and all the dialogues in the film it seems to me highly improbable that this film was made without and actual written script (as the legend says).The performances, especially from Jean Seberg, are excellent and she is both adorable and despicable, while Jean-Paul Belmondo gives his most iconic character a true and realistic feel.? Bout De Soufflé is a relationship-based film noir with groundbreaking direction and editing, fascinating dialogues, highly influential performances both in and outside the film and it is a masterpiece from Jean-Luc Godard.Rating: 5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Reinvent The Wheel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jean-Luc Godard intended to shake the delicate world of cinema, that much is obvious. But did he intend to reinvent it? Whether it was his intention or not isn't the point, the point is this; he did. Jean-Luc Godard, and Francois Truffuat are the undisputed fathers of the French New Wave. Some cinephiles or historians may feel like pointing elsewhere, to Jean Renoir for example, protesting that he is truly the father of the French New Wave, I disagree entirely. The French New Wave was a product of the kindred spirits and talents of Godard and Truffaut. And no other film represents the French New Wave more coherently than Jean-Luc Godard's dazzling 1960 picture, 'Breathless'. Unorthodox and uninhibited. Raw and experimental. Godard broke every rule in the book, disavowed the laws of cinema, and scribed a new rule book, one where the pages are blank, and possibilities are endless. The story is so simple I can summarize the entire film in half of a sentence, but I refuse to give you or Godard the satisfaction. What counts in Breathless is not the story, but how the story is told. The very definition of 'cool', the film is robust in creativity, and exuberant in its flaws, and passionate about its reckless behavior. Self aware and rebellious. If there was no breathless, there would have been no Tarantino, if there was no French New Wave, the streak of genius that ran through the nineties and 2000s wouldn't have existed. Before Breathless, it was believed that films took money, that you had to find yourself in a place of authority to make a film. Breathless broke this misconception. Breathless makes you want to run outside and make the film of your life. Breathless made that possible, Breathless made the amateur the auteur, Breathless reinvented the face of the cinema, and made you believe that could too. All you need is a girl and gun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fresh New Wave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A small-time crook goes on the lam after killing a policeman. Godard makes an auspicious film debut, kicking off the influential French New Wave movement with this freewheeling drama. It is perhaps the director's most appealing work, as his films became increasingly eccentric and abstract throughout his career. Even after half a century it seems remarkably fresh, with its fluid hand-held camera work. Much of the credit must go to Belmondo, who makes what is basically an unsympathetic character into someone charming and likable. Seberg is also appealing as his American girlfriend. An extended bedroom scene where the two banter about this and that is one of the highlights.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style over substance but not half bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jean-Luc Godard's "Breathless" is a landmark film in the world of cinema. It was an important early work in the French new wave and served as an indication of things to come. As for the story, it involves a roguish car thief (Jean-Paul Belmondo) who tries to convince his girlfriend (Jean Seberg) to run off to Italy with him after he kills a police officer.The story is almost secondary here. There are plenty of long conversations with little impact on the actual plot. There is an unmistakeably existentialist slant to the film, which would have appealed to me less had Godard not infused the film with such frenetic energy with his bold visuals and innovative cutting.The cast is pretty good with Belmondo &amp; Seberg convincingly infusing their characters with vivid life. Michel is either a lovable scoundrel or an incorrigible bastard, I can't quite decide which. It makes for an entertaining performance but in the end the character's fate didn't mean much to me. The same goes for Seberg's character, whose crisis might as well have not been introduced in the first place.Ultimately, while I appreciate the film's impact on film-making I prefer the results of its influence found in later films. Moreover, I am of the opinion that its exalted status is due more to its historical significance than its intrinsic quality. That being said, I do think that it is a worthwhile film, though those with historical perspective will no doubt gain the most satisfaction from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When smoking was cool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this for the first time a few years after it came out when I was too young to appreciate it. Some forty years on I think I am too old to appreciate it. The stylistic novelties--jump cuts, long tracking shots, natural lighting, ironic score, hand held cameras, grainy black and white--now seem passé.I have sometimes wondered what my reaction to this would have been had I come to it with no foreknowledge. I think there are few who have had that experience since opinions and reviews hit the presses early on, almost a year before this wave came to the shores of the U.S. The mythology surrounding a film such as this becomes as important as the film itself.The story revolves around Michel (Jean-Paul Belmondo) and Patrica (Jean Seberg). While the amoral Michel steals cars, murders a policeman, and robs people, Patrica tries to figure out if she loves him. The film alternates between realism, like a long scene in a hotel suite where the two talk and talk and talk, and stylistic cinematic flurries that call attention to themselves. Neither Michel nor Patricia seems to care much about anything. Even when Michel knows the police are closing in on him he does not attempt flight, complaining that he is tired.Since the story is not much and the characters are not terribly appealing, appreciation must come mainly from the presentation. There is no mystery to Michel, he is aimless and shallow, trying desperately to effect coolness. Micel's affectations of rubbing his thumb across his lips and making a sequence of faces bugged me the first time he did them and by the time he had done these things several more times I was ready to hurl a frying pan at him. Goddard films Seberg in a way to give her a commanding presence and at least she retains some element of mystery. It is hard to see why Patricia, an American expatriate and student at the Sorbonne, had such a hard time figuring out whether she loved Michel. All of the stylistic innovations mentioned above kept my interest, but the prevailing mood of anomie rubbed off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this film, I thought, "So What?' The reason for that reaction was because it was the mid 1980's and all that Godard had to offer was already being used in the MTV video clips, flashy television commercials and other wanna-be Godardian filmmakers. It wasn't until after I saw Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction did I decided to revisit Breathless, and glad that I did. To me, this is where it all started from. Godard was hipper than hip. He brought together the then modern culture infused with the classic Hollywood detective genre of the 40s and 50s. He mixed it all up, gave it a shake and came up with this landmark movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Godard made a masterpiece when he directed this film in 1960. Sadly, it was purged by Richard Gere many years later. The epitome of the French New Wave, this film established new boundaries by expanding the eye's visual field, challenging a person to see things images jumping, yet staying cohesive with each other. Quite an experience, and the beginning of an amazing era of film. Its too bad the French are more busy trying to make scandalous porno-style flicks than trying to make good film. I mean, they were the first ones to ever create modern films, and they choose to take the low route. Godard, Rouch, Marker, Resnais, Truffaut and the Lumieres would be embarrassed b y the grave state of French cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My introduction to the work of the French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard happened a little more than two years ago when I bought and saw the Criterion DVD (the very first Criterion DVD that I bought) of his Bande ? part (aka: Band of Outsiders). I was immensely excited and Godard didn't disappoint me, of course I was ready to see more of his films. Until this year the only Godard film available on R4 DVD was, if I'm not wrong, one of his most recent ones (the 2004 Notre musique)...the fact that I saw my second Godard film (certainly it was his Breathless) just 4 nights ago has to deal in a way with how hard and how expensive is to get your DVDs of Godard's films in my city. Just in a way because I do own Notre musique since well at least a year ago and well of course you can always go after the illegal copies or have some luck and find some Godard to rent at a Blockbuster! But anyway, about a month ago I realized about the fact that finally a R4 DVD Godard collection is available, I was very glad and for a decent price I was able to get first Made in U.S.A. and later Alphaville. However before I had the time to watch those two films I stop by at my local Blockbuster only to find that they were selling real gems, used yet practically new R1 DVDs that you usually find for about $30 in just $3 and $5. I bought that day Wim Wenders'The American Friend (the Anchor Bay DVD), Takashi Miike's The Bird People in China, Nagisa Oshima's Ai no borei (which I also own together with other three films, including Ai no corrida, as part of a VHS collection of erotic films) and Godard's Breathless (not the Criterion but the Fox Lorber DVD). Breathless goes extremely fast and begins with the main character, Jean-Paul Belmondo's character Michel, doing what he does: doing crimes. We see him stealing a car and soon after killing a cop. During these first minutes of the film you get the feeling of it, the music is fantastic. Soon Michel is in Paris and in a way the whole crime film is forgotten, I say in a way because of course for us is present that Michel is seeking for money and that the police is after him but as the film goes on and with Jean Seberg's character Patricia already in the film we go in a completely different way. I loved how the film forgets about everything and just gets talky with its two main characters...that whole section that happens in Patricia's apartment is a sort of perfect example to point out why I loved Breathless: we have a conversation pretty much about nothing yet we don't really care, we are following closely the characters, their dialog flows and we don't want to stop it. Other highlights are a great cameo of Jean-Pierre Melville as a writer (it's a really good scene..."two things are important in life: for men, women, for women, money"), the final decision of Patricia. And of course the performances of Belmondo and Seberg are extremely memorable, being Belmondo very cool as a fan of Humphrey Bogart (always smoking. in the film Blue in the Face, I have seen only bits of it, master Jim Jarmusch says that he thinks that a lot of people start smoking because is glamorized in movies and also that "the f***** up thing is you go to Hollywood now, they got us hocked on cigarettes and now you can't smoke anywhere...they come over, I'm sorry Sir smoking is prohibited by law"; Breathless is a film that can give any young man desires to light a cigarette) and Seberg extremely lovely as a beginner in the world of journalism.

Two attractive people who talk sex but get little. The guy asks if he can urinate in the girl's bathroom sink and we get to see her wash her feet. Lucky us. 4. Had this not been done by a foreign director it would have never enjoyed it's standing. Scenes of the countryside and Paris are fine, so here's my 3 stars for them and the cameraman in the wheelchair.See the original "Diabolique" , "Wages of Fear" &amp; "Rififi" if you want to see great films from France.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Landmark in post-modern cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It really is an interesting film. It's certainly an exercise in style over substance, as the real 'meat' of the story is expressed through the camera work and the images. The narrative itself is pretty much second to the visual aspect. That's not to say there isn't a solid story, because there is, but the film's not about that at all. If one were to ignore all the technical and artistic aspects and just focus on the plot and characters, they probably wouldn't like it very much. The story is meandering and doesn't seem to fit all together; the characters are mostly unlikeable; the ending is certainly weak. Yet I loved the film.At once both a homage to and a mockery of film-noir, the film requires of its audience a certain cinematic knowledge. For instance, Michel's idolization of Bogart would be lost on someone completely unfamiliar with Bogart or his films. The exaggerated quirks (such as the lip rubbing) that the actor Belmondo adds to his character may seem irrelevant or annoying to an ignorant viewer, but it is essential to the film. The genre conventions are there, but twisted and revised and updated; everything from the femme fatale to the dark ending is intact. The jazzy score only adds to this feeling. For a lover of film-noir, this is a must-see.When it comes to the direction of a film, this is as good as it gets. Godard's famous use of jump cuts is perfectly utilized, energizing scenes that would otherwise be static. The alternation between quick, flashy editing and steady long takes is effective at reflecting the main character's actions and nature. There are no boring scenes in this film, as one can just admire the camera work when the dialogue becomes meaningless. And there are many instances when the dialogue does nothing to further the story, but the direction makes up for that.As a newcomer to the French New Wave, I have no idea what the majority of films in this movement are like. If they are half as stylish, innovative, energetic, goofy, and wild as this film, I'm sure I will enjoy them all. As it stands now, this is a terrific piece of art film and a landmark in post-modern cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the - if not THE - best movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently I saw this movie for the second time; the first time was over ten years ago. Vaguely I remembered that it made quite an impression, just like all the early Godard movies (which, in those days, were fortunately broadcast by the German tv). Well, to be short: this movie is absolutely stunning, fantastic, sublime, smashing, et cetera. This is film just like film should be: not a stupid story told in a boring matter - like most movies do - but downright art, excuse me, ART. There is a wonderful co-operation between director, photography, actors, and the scenery of France, Paris in particular. Jean-Paul Belmondo has never been a truly great actor; after playing in some early Godards he appeared mainly in quite bad Hollywood-style French thrillers. But somehow he seems to be the right man in the right place. Jean Seberg is not only unbelievably beautiful but also the absolute star of the movie (at least on the screen). She is just perfect in her role. And last but not least: the soundtrack by French jazz star Martial Solal is completely spot on. There is clear synergy between the restless photography, the restless music and of course the restless characters of the protagonists.This movie cannot be missed. It belongs in a league with for example Bertolucci's Il Conformista, Bunuel's Belle de Jour, Godard's own Le Mépris (completely different by the way). More than that: it was an important step in creating an entirely new way of making and assessing films. In other words: one of the - if not THE - best and important movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four stars. Belmondo. Seberg. Godard. Paris.Yes, this wonder does usher in modern cinema, but it keeps eluding Godard's grasp, as Michel (American cinema; masculinity; irresponsibility; style; action) and Patricia (modernism; ambition; commitment; lessons from Melville) battle, ironically, for his soul.For all the subversion, irony, parody, pastiche, self-reflexivity, alienation techniques Godard hurls in our faces, it is impossible not to be captivated, on a conventional level, by the romance of 'A bout de souffle', its giddy narrative, its charismatic stars.It is said that the inverse proportion given, in a supposed crime movie, to a brief cop-killing and a lengthy bedroom discussion, neuters the film as a crime movie - not true; it takes us where crime movies never went before (except 'Bob le flambeur', of course).Not misogynistic: both Patricia and Godard inform on Michel.We are not watching Michel and Patricia in a plot about murder and money; we are watching Belmondo, Seberg, Godard and Paris playing a film called 'A Bout de souffle'.Far from distancing us from 'film', this realism brings us nearer. No wonder Godard disowns it.Magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time has not been good to "Breathless"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the late 1950's and early 1960's the French reinterpreted American film. They saw "Cinema" where everyone else say movies. From Alfred Hitchcock to John Ford to Jerry Lewis, the popular transcended into the divine. And so the "Auteur Theory" was born in the pages of the "Cashiers Du Cinema".Truffaut, Godard, etc. not only appreciated the classic Hollywood of the 1940's and 1950's, they worshiped it. Breathless was meant to be a Gallic interpretation of film noir. Time, however, has left it flat. So much has changed in the last 45 years, that the novelty of disjointed action seems tame and exaggerated crime drama falls flat by today's standards. This film shows it's age.I recently saw "? bout de soufflé" and "Out Of The Past" together. There is real "Noir" and a pale copy. Historically, "Breathless" may be interesting as a curiosity. But it's artificiality falls flat when compared to the real thing. It is a student trying to copy his master. And only leads to a pale imitation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shattered the mold and changed cinema forever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Modern movies begin here," said Roger Ebert about Breathless, one of the most influential films of all time. Breathless exploded film into the modern age with its radical use of jump-cut editing, a jazzy score, and its overall sensation of freedom. One of the early films of the French New Wave, it has a powerful sense of youth and was a conscious break from the traditional, more conservative method of film-making. It shattered the mold, broke all the rules, and became an inspiration to new film-makers for decades to come. The story is relatively simple, about a murder suspect, Michel, evading the law in Paris, seemingly without a care in the world, while hanging out with his American girlfriend, Patricia, who establishes herself as an interesting and powerful character in her own right. Michel seems more interested in getting laid than getting away, and at times is resigned to spending his life in jail. But in the end he wouldn't go quietly, free until his last breath. The film has a constantly moving camera, which leaves the audience breathless as well, and cinema was forever changed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film when I was sixteen and remember thinking how cool and hip it was at time. French New Wave they called it. And what did I think of 'Breathless' fifty years on after viewing the anniversary DVD. Well, I'm not sure which I found funnier, reading the other comments eulogising over Jean-Luc Godard or the movie itself. This exaggerated snapshot of Parisian sub-culture circa 1959 simply does qualify as a 'Great Film'. Great films are like great music. You would not say Tchaikovsky's Pathetique was a great symphony for 1893: it is a great symphony this or any other year. Gone with the Wind and All Quiet on the Western Front are great films because they are as watchable now as they were when first produced. I have watched both 'Les Parapluies de Cherbourg' and 'Un Homme et une Femme' in the last six months.Both films are of the same decade as Breathless but survive much better. Suffice to say that Breathless may have wooed them in 1960 but it wouldn't today.Each generation has produced films which seemed chic and fashionable on opening but which quickly become nothing more than clichés for the period in which they were produced. They became nostalgic and amusing reminders of a seemingly more innocent age. It is however worth watching this film for no other reason than seeing Jean Seberg. She is mesmerising.I remember falling in love with that beautiful face and she even made bobbysocks seem cool! How tragic it is that she died so young. Yes, this film is a collector's item but I'm not sure it's necessarily for the right reasons. I can't profess to being a Godard devotee. In my opinion he's over-hyped but people continue to go into intellectual overdrive to express their admiration of his style. Anyone though who can produce a blockbuster on a shoestring budget does deserve some respect. He would seem to be a director that is above criticism and that is is ridiculous. The Tarantino of his generation? If you like but not for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Special Debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jean-Luc Godard film debut was one of the most defining and influential films in history. ? bout de soufflé tells the story of the life of Michel Poiccard and his love interest Patricia Franchini, the film starts with our protagonist shooting a police officer, laying out a story of running from the law and trying to convince an American girl living in France to escape with him to go to Italy and start a new life.The plot of this masterpiece is not particularly original, and the techniques used especially the jumpy editing might look a tad dated for modern day audience. But what should be kept in mind is that those techniques were unheard of at the time of its release, Godard reinvented the art of film-making in ways that can be seen to this very day. As for the plot, ? bout de soufflé was almost an homage to the Hollywood flicks of the '40s and '50s, there was particularly a scene with Michel looking at posters of Humphrey Bogart on a movie theater in admiration and longing.The new techniques and influential value are not the only thing that make this a masterpiece, ? bout de soufflé has one of the strongest scripts you'll likely to see on the screen. There is one particular scene in the middle with Michel and Patricia talking in a hotel room, no action, nothing happens, even the discussion is nothing more than casual chit-chat, yet it is still highly intriguing that you can't take your eyes off of it. Every utterance, every word is brilliantly placed even if it has no bearing on the events of the film, a quality that mocks the tradition of crime films where everything has to mean something and lead to something. Godard's script is like life, meaningless in most parts, it just goes on and on emphasizing the characters' empty lives and their moral dualities and that is why it is so effective.A special mention has to go to Jean Seberg and especially Jean-Paul Belmondo who is memorable in his portrayal of the wanna-be hip criminal with his cigarette and spot on delivery, he makes Michel interesting with a subtle sense of desperation and unfulfilled ambition. The supporting cast does a solid job in keeping up with the main characters as well.? bout de soufflé is a must viewing for any movie fan. Its influence on cinema is remarkable, and unlike many influential movies that have nothing but new techniques to show for their merit, ? bout de soufflé has a solid story and script that makes it worthy of every acclaim it has received.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If all you have ever seen and been exposed to is the American-type persona in movies, television, books and music, you are missing something more; something different and yet saying the same thing. Any serious film fan knows of the French New Wave, the movement in the 1950s and 1960s that sparked the American film movement in the 1960s and inspired our own New Wave in the 1970s. Of that period, perhaps the most well-known director is Jean-Luc Godard, and his best known work is Breathless.A rather interesting title, because that is exactly what this movie is. Of course there is a twenty-some minute scene in a hotel room that brings the narrative to a screeching halt, but that as well was revolutionary and daring for any film in that day. The new and exciting techniques and attitude of Breathless are what create its reputation and why it is considered so important in the history of film. However, it can also be approached simply as the story of a wanna-be gangster who wants the girl he longs for to run away with him but has the law on his tail as well.Of course, could Breathless be as it is without the fascinating performances of its leads, in particular Jean Seberg as Patricia? Jean-Paul Belmondo plays it straight and we need that to take us through the story, but Seberg always detracts from the audience and that is part of the intrigue. What does she really think of Michel, and what will she do with him? Their scene in the hotel room is absorbing not only because of how Godard shot it with available light, overhead angles and those famous jump cuts, but also the dialogue. What are these people talking about and why? The subject in discussion changes hands frequently, but they both have the same goal in mind the whole time: Michel to sleep with Patricia and Patricia to find out about Michel.The opening is unique in that we get no back story; just plunge right into this world and the surroundings that come with it. Speaking of which, is there a better backdrop then Paris? Perhaps not, and that is only part of what makes this an unforgettable experience. Certainly, it needs to be seen multiple times, but I get the feeling that many will get its message the first time. The true message Godard was trying to relate was: the world is changing, and that includes the cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the finest and most exciting films in cinema history. Deathless. It immortalised Seberg, Belmondo and Godard. Only the sad Seberg (evidently a girl of Swedish ancestry) is dead yet. The subtly plotted storyline unrolls, without a single unnecessary element, to its remorseless end, but is always exciting, no matter how many times it is viewed. Will she, won't she? What will she decide to do? The bedroom sequence, with its verbal-physical exchanges between Seberg and Belmondo, is riveting: mesmerizing, painfully true and witty, though nothing for lunk-headed semi-literates, for whom thought is a chore. The scene is real and to the point, so follow the argument. Get involved.One theme is the impact of American society and culture (huh?) on France. A plump, bourgeois American officer and his plump, bourgeois wife have their American car stolen by a slim, ultra-cool, Italo-Frenchman, who loves France, but wants to make it in Cinecitta. He lives a vicarious life, with imported celluloid values. Finding that Americans always, naturally, keep handguns in their car glove compartments, he decides to use the one he's handed. The American Dream becomes reality, anxiety-ridden and finally exhausting. Belmondo identifies with his cinematic other-life, to the full. It tells him how to live and die. Eisenhower features in the parade, Bogart in the movies.My disc came with a trailer for the remake. It looked quite hideous, so I won't bother. However, some people seem to like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breathless, but not exasperated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This classic from the New Wave has aged like a subtle Bordeaux?perhaps a bit brackish at times, but still potent and sublime. It is memorable but not for everyone's taste. A joyride in the country turns into a getaway when Michel, the antihero gangster, turns his gun loose on a cop after a traffic violation. We don't have enough time to question his motives because in the next breath we are in Paris. We see Paris from the point of view of a passenger whose face is pressed against the car's window. In Paris, he finds his former lover (Patricia) selling New York Herald Tribune newspapers on the Champs-Elysees.We sense that Michel knows his days are numbered. He has killed a cop in cold blood, and all of Paris wants him caught. His nonchalance is gripping yet frustrating. The plot (as in other New Wave films) is forgettable. Michel's character is part Humphrey Bogart (a poster of whom Michel stares at in Breathless), part nouveau roman antihero. He's the bad guy we're supposed to like.Michel's character is the spine of this film. He lacks the sort of remorse and softness that characterize movie heroes. That's the point. He is insistent in making love to Patricia. A cigarette is never far from his lip. He apes other people's facial expressions. Those who argue that his character is bad are falling prey to the sort of gut reactions that Godard explores and rejects. Godard introduces a then-revolutionary technique in Breathless: the jump-cut. This method breaks up the action and gives the film an energetic, fresher feel. Godard is a master at playing with the length of each cut, restricting what we can see and leaving the rest ambiguous.The film feels young like the director himself and the characters. Patricia sleeps with a teddy bear and has a tom-boy haircut. Michel is fearless and carefree, like many adolescents. This film is Godard's first feature film (he made at the age of thirty, after a Swiss documentary).The film is also important for its references to American films and cinematography. Godard loved American cinema, and was influenced by Hollywood directors. The references to the Cahiers du Cinema (a film critique magazine) and other films are a noble homage to his influences.Watch this film. It isn't long (about 87 minutes). Criterion Collection's translation is intended for North American audiences, but its re-mastering is top-notch. The film's score is marvelous. It's a classic, but not a tedious one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>style and plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone talks about style, but I think the writing is subtle but very good. I like the plot twist here. In pre-feminist era films, women are always victimized by men. Every film noir had strong female leads, but each were weak and vulnerable when it came to men. This film turns the table. Michel is evil (murderer, thief, cad) and yet, he is completely vulnerable to Patricia. She can love, but she can still be herself, much like men of the classic era. The story explains the nature of love more than any film previously. Love is complex and messy, not a simple affair. Not black and white, which is another clever play, since color could have been employed in the film. The style of this film really was revolutionary to this day and still worth seeing. If you are interested in the history of film then you will like this film. If you are simply interested in good story, this is still worth your time. However, I think there are more modern stories that have done a better job since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A love letter to cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Breathless" is certainly one of the most talked-about films in history (academically, at least), and its technical innovations, influence, and place in film history have been covered in far more detail than I could fit into a 1000-word IMDb comment, so this particular comment will focus on whether or not I think "Breathless" works purely as a movie.I'll never be able to completely ignore the fact that "Breathless" has an important place in film history when watching it, but I can say that every single time I've seen it (and that's many, many times) I have been thoroughly entertained. "Breathless" is remarkably pure, undiluted cinema, shot by two people on a shoestring budget. It's also fun to note that three titans of the French New Wave, Melville, Truffuat, and Godard, were all involved in some capacity in this film."Breathless" was shot on a hand-held camera by Godard and his cinematographer Raoul Coutard. There were no other crew involved in principal shooting for the film. With that taken into account, "Breathless" is a fine-looking film, with editing that still has the intended effect today, a good musical score, and acting that remains striking in 2008. It's an admirable low-budget effort, a love letter to cinema which regardless of your personal feelings on the film at least tries to do something interesting."Breathless" is far from Godard's best film, and I doubt that many who have seen more than a few films by him would say that it is. It's not as purely entertaining or involving as "Band of Outsiders" and it lacks the intellectual and philosophical bent of many of his other movies, but as pure cinema it works.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Breathless", as the majority of my readers know, is considered the film that put the "New Wave" cinematic movement on the map. Its strength is the casual way in which it is presented. Whereas most movies give the viewer the impression of watching a movie, "Breathless" appears to be a direct glimpse at life itself. The continuously roving camera and the unusual camera angles create a sense of freedom seldom encountered in the movies."Breathless" demonstrates the auteur method of film-making, in which the director is really the star of the picture. The manner in which the film is shot is as noticeable and integral to the final product as the actors and the plot are.Unconventionality is what makes "Breathless" distinctive and allows a movie with a sparse plot and a detached treatment of its characters to work as an unusual and ultimately satisfying viewing experience. Intellectual satisfaction.I appreciated "Breathless"'s technical innovation and creativity but I didn't ever feel a connection with the two main characters so I would not call "Breathless" a complete success. It was long on style and short on substance. A movie that revolves around two characters who are not likable due to callousness and shallowness is courting disaster. The movie lacked FEELING.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is vagueness cool?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jean-Paul Belmondo as an attractive criminal, Michel, with a fondness for Bogart, seems to drift into crime rather casually, as when he steals a car and when a policemen catches up with him, there just happens to be a gun in the glove compartment, and he shoots him. Michel has a vague romantic attachment to the American Patricia (Jean Seberg), who is exceedingly vague herself. The famous 'honesty' of this film must stem from the fact that both lovers speak a good deal about how uncertain they are about whether they love each other, though they do. It's not really a crime drama, because there's very little dash and bravado and nothing to gain. In place of these elements there is only charm. Quite a lot of charm. But this charm is peculiar because it's so ambivalent. At the end Patricia turns her lover Michel in to the police, to see if she really loves him. If she loves him such an act would be so "méchant" (wicked, spiteful), and so the test is proof. Michel disdains escape?-he's tired, he says, and wants to sleep, though perhaps not to die, which is what he does. His last words are misrepresented to Patricia, who looks frozen at the camera and turns away. And oh, I wish I knew what the blurb authors meant when they used the word 'existentialist' about this film. That term covers a lot of vagueness and ambivalence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the French Nouvelle Vague period, and most of the films from that era are masterpieces of cinema, including many works by Jean-Luc Godard."Breathless" is not one of these. It is a boring film, badly directed, based on a childish screenplay, starring a young Jean-Paul Belmondo before he reached his age of acting maturity and whose style and manners move from "dramatic" to idiotic between endless bedroom conversations and changing face expressions fit to make you fall asleep.It is worth spending 90 minutes for this movie only to see the outdoor scenes of Paris in 1960, and enjoy the beautiful face and good performance of Jean Seberg who unfortunately passed away almost 20 years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Breathless is often referred to as one of the most influential motion pictures of all time. It is seen as a breakthrough in cinema history. The reason for this is in the editing: Breathless is what introduced jump cutting. The use of jump cuts was groundbreaking back in the early 1960s. It's a style that is still used and has been ever-popularized by MTV. However, in Breathless the jump cuts are not non-stop. The reason the technique works in Breathless is because it is only used occasionally and when it is put into use, it isn't overkill. Jump-cutting and flashy edits don't make a movie, all they can add style to it if it's appropriate. The edits made in Breathless go along with the stylistic neo-noir style. Following the noir style, there is the woman that ultimately gets our hero (or in this particular case, anti-hero) in trouble. Although the woman in the film, Patricia, leads to the Michel's downfall, it would not be right to call her a femme fatale. There isn't a hint of immediate danger with her. Neither is there a sense of innocence with her. She appears to have good qualities as well as bad qualities. In other words, she appears human. This is important because she doesn't come across as one-dimensional villain at the end of the picture. By the time the final twist is revealed, Patricia has been developed as a character with depth. She is shown as a woman with strong feelings and reasons behind what she does. It is important to note that she isn't afraid to turn Michel in. Had Michel lived, he may have been proud of Patricia in an odd way for showing such courage as he had said earlier: "being afraid is the worst fault there is." Michel's opinion of fear being a fault is interesting when taken into account that the main reason for a criminal to be on the run is fear of getting caught and punished for his actions. Whether acknowledged by Michel or not, fear does serve as a factor for his running. There is no way that Michel does not feel fear at any point during his journey. Perhaps it is the fear of getting caught that persuades Michel to comment on other peoples' fears such as when he remarks he hates taxi drivers that are afraid of getting the paint on the car scratched. This demonstrates one of Michel's many faults. Michel is a phony. He is not the strong, smooth criminal that he pretends to be. He is a liar and a cheat, not the most sympathetic of characters. However, that is one of the strengths of Breathless. The characters are not the squeaky clean, sympathetic types that are all too common in the Hollywood productions of today. It is because of Michel's aforementioned anti-hero status that Breathless will remain timeless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was a period (roughly from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s) when it was hard to see A BOUT DE Soufflé, not because it was unavailable, but because it had been copied so much that the freshness and the vitality (which had been much-remarked upon on the movie's initial release) seemed to have seeped out. This romantic-ironic thriller about a charming (but murderous) Parisian hood and his lovely (but treacherous) American girlfriend has withstood the ravages of time, and is now as much a classic French thriller as Becker's TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI or Carne's QUAI DES BRUMES. Particularly poignant are the performances of Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg, so youthful, delightful and enticing: it's hard to realize that Belmondo would use the popularity this film gave him to embark on a steadily declining career as a box-office fixture, and that Seberg would have such a tragically embattled life. But seeing them in A BOUT DE Soufflé, you're seeing them at their best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A milestone film that still holds up as basic entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A thief accidentally kills a policeman and needs to collect on debts in order to skip town.If I was to write my own personal milestones of cinema - and this would be one of them - you might be surprised at some of the names that crop up. Not all the films on my imaginary list would be that good, but all would have a role in forming the cinema that we know and enjoy today.For example, 1930's horror taught the industry a lot of tension and cinematography tricks that you see today in mainstream productions. Today's thrillers such as Se7en and Silence of the Lambs (to use two obvious names from thousands) have more to do with The Bride of Frankenstein than, say, Kiss Me Deadly.Another example would be the way that the James Bond series gave heroes the right to casually kill those that opposed him. Starting first with Doctor No. The French "New Wave" introduced naturalism, honesty and sexual tension to the screen. The subtitles allowing them to get away with things that no Hollywood films would allow at the time.(However don't think I am blindly championing it - it produced just as much dross as Hollywood.)Goddard is not actually my favourite French New Wave director because he is too self-indulgent, but he has a lot of courage and he is his own man. If something intrigues him, he holds it in frame until his curiosity is spent. For him the thing is personal and if you say you don't like it his answer would be "well go and make your own film then."The problem with some people reviewing this film is that they seem to believe that because there are tricks for foreshortening scenes they should have been employed. This is a not a chase film per se, but a look at people under a stressful situation. It is easy to say that this is a cheap film. However the real Paris is a wonderful set and I prefer it to any of the Warner Brothers cardboard and plywood versions.The dialogue seems fresh and interesting, but my French isn't good enough to do without the subtitles. The lovers seem questioning of their relationship (they started without the aid of a full script) and Jean Seberg's character is hard to work out from the evidence presented here.(Obviously a liker of bad boys, but I don't really have enough evidence to make any strong statements about her. Her look is more memorable than her acting which remains hold-it-all-in.)Belmondo does a good job of portraying the kind of criminal that is under represented on the screen and over represented in real life: Young, stupid and reckless.This film opened up a new way of making and enjoying films that went against the Hollywood rules - especially to do with sex and sexuality. Even if the sex is actually performed totally off-screen!</fullReview>

I was bored by the sappy overacting and lame plot. More recently, we have Eternal Sunshine, which is apparently very innovative, yet totally sappy, crappy, and obnoxious. Breathless, however, is both extremely avant-garde (even today), yet still very entertaining. Godard shows that we can really move forward while keeping sight of what we've done in the past. Remember, movies are here to entertain. The characters are lovable, Jean Seberg is HOT HOT HOT!!!!!, and the story is well done. I loved it quite a bit. The only gripe I had was that the editing was a little choppy. Other than that, It's near perfect.Final Cut: A-Direction: B Style: A+ Script: A- Acting: A- Music: A Hats off!Fun fact: Godard couldn't afford a dolly, so he pushed the cinematographer around in a wheelchair instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(A Little Spoiler Included)One reason that Godard's debut feature Breathless has permanently changed the cinema is that it shows revolutionary cinematic techniques along with young and rebellious attitude. The other is that, at the same time, the film still tells a compelling story. Disrespectful methods, such as location shooting, casting unknown actors, and handheld camera, meaningfully and miraculously enhance the simple story of a Paris lowlife. Editing, which makes a dynamic contrast between long takes and piles of fragmented shots (with Godard's signature jump cut), effectively presents the relativity of time, while it harshly reminds the audience that the world they are watching is fictitious. Music, which includes Classical (Jean Seberg playing the record of Mozart Clarinet Concerto) and the original score with a European Jazz taste, indicates the layer of diverse values that are imbedded in the film. Belmondo running to death in the emotionally intense last scene parallels Godard's fearless determination in his radical filmmaking.</fullReview>

The characterization is sublime in its subtle, matter-of-fact portrayal of Michel Poiccard (Jean-Paul Belmondo) and Patricia Franchini (Jean Seberg) and the direction is second-to-none, despite a limited budget.? bout de souffle works with, yet conflicts with Hollywood in many ways. It displays accessible characters through an accessible narrative and on the whole it agrees with the Hollywood conventions of time, space and linearity. However, Goddard employs some original techniques never seen before in Hollywood. Belmondo talks to the camera freely, which heightens the audience participation, the characters openly converse about sex, which creates a degree of verisimilitude and the protagonist dies, which heightens the tragedy at the film's conclusion.If, like me, you thought Goddard was being crass when he said, "all you need to make a film is a girl and a gun" then watch this film and you might be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Breathless (1959) ** (out of 4) Jean-Luc Godard's "masterpiece" about a young thug (Jean-Paul Belmondo) who steals a car and eventually kills a cop. While trying to raise money to get out of town he also tries to talk an American girl (Jean Seberg) into leaving with him. I've read a lot of filmmakers say this is a film that inspired them but outside the visual style I found very little here to enjoy. The look of the film is the only thing that really kept me interesting. The strange, fast edits certainly had an impact on someone like Scorsese and the dark and shadows was a nice throwback to the film noirs of the 1940s. The two leads are also good in their roles but the screenplay, or lack of one, really kills this thing. I don't mind movies about nothing but this film takes that a little too far. The worst moment in the film and the one that really made me lose interest was when Michel went into the girlfriend's hotel and we stay there listening to them talk for a good fifteen minutes or more. The constant "I want to sleep with you" stuff got tiresome and nothing they said really kept me interested and it had very little to do with anything that followed (or came before).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whenever talking to pretentious people, there are certain films always on their favorite films of all-time list. Mostly foreign films, along the lines of something like Amelie, or something from the ilk of Pedro Almodovar or Wong Kar Wai, and one of the more common films often given the top honor on such pretentious lists is the French New Wave classic, Jean Luc Godard's Breathless.This film is often given a great deal of credit for its "innovative" use of the jump cut, inspiring the likes of Martin Scorsese in the next generation of filmmakers. Whether the film is "innovative" or not, it's sad to say that the story is nothing special.The film is a gangster movie, clearly drawing inspiration from Hollywood's own film noirs. A gangster is being pursued by the police for murdering a cop and he must get out of Paris, but before he leaves he tries to convince an American newspaper saleswoman to join him as he flees to Italy. Ultimately, the story falls flat, never having any emotional connection and is a lot of the times being edgy simply to be, not because the edginess was needed to make the film more intriguing.As can be gathered, I'm not the biggest fan of this film. The story never really intrigued me all that much, and at many times there were these long scenes of dialogue that ultimately built character, but had absolutely nothing to do with the plot and I was just sitting there looking at the time on my phone wondering when the film would move on to something more intriguing.As for all of the "innovative" aspects of the film, such as the bazillion jump cuts and whatnot within, yes, the film did manage to inspire countless other filmmakers with its way of telling story in such a jumpy way, but in a great many ways, I believe that those weren't originally intended. While it ended up working in Godard's favor, you look, this was his first film he'd ever directed, whether it be feature length or a short. I mean, honestly there must have been mistakes (I had five million in the first film I ever made, and that is why it still has never seen the light of day), so perhaps what most consider to be the most brilliant aspect of Breathless in actuality was perhaps just a happy mistake, but then again the only person who knows the truth is Godard, and he's not telling.At the end of the day, Breathless is not the best presentation of the French New Wave, you want that watch The 400 Blows. While Breathless is often cited as a classic, I believe it is merely a classic because it inspired countless filmmakers and that the film itself is not a really fantastic film. But then again, perhaps I'm just not pretentious enough to enjoy it? I don't know.I give Breathless a 4 out of 10!</fullReview>

In "Breathless" these are the heroine as an American newspaper reporter interviewing an author of a new book as he compares European and foreign love;the hand wound cameras roll,we see the 1959 tape reels turning: Belmondo as the fugitive doesn't think twice about felling a man in the toilets with a rabbit punch (perhaps fatally) to steal his wallet:he makes off in someone's car with Seeberg and gives a fellow gangster (?) the "high five" (long before it ever appeared in the US). A defining moment might be when he pulls himself up as he stares at a poster of Humphrey Bogart advertising "La plus dure la chute"----the harder they fall.....as if predictive of his fate.

		<fullReview>Raymond Chandler once said of Alan Ladd (for whom he wrote the classic screenplay 'The Blue Dahlia') that Ladd was a small boy's idea of a tough guy. In the same way and paraphrasing Chandler to some extent Jean-Luc Godard is a young pseud's idea of a film director. As someone who loses no opportunity to slate this inept semi-amateur director I decided in the interests of fair play to take a look at the piece of cheese that made his name, 'Breathless', which was shown at the Cine Lumiere last week (in its wisdom or, more likely, as a prelude to its closing for a month as it does every August) the Cine Lumiere is hosting a Godard season this month and if the turnout for Breathless (about half a dozen deadbeats and most of them only sheltering from the rain) is anything to go by they have one eye on a tax break for next April. So, how does this klutz screw it up? Let me count the ways. It's no secret that French film makers have long been enamoured of American Directors and clearly Godard is no exception. He even dedicates this drek to Monogram Pictures - for the non-cognoscenti Monogram was a Poverty Row outfit where anything over 75 minutes was considered an epic but compared to Breathless the worst piece of crap ever put out by Monogram was Citizen Kane. In 1958 Welle's great 'Touch Of Evil' hit the stands and soon its opening tracking shot became a cause celebre and had the Gilbert Adair set creaming in their pants. Welles, of course, had a point for that famous tracking shot but, clearly having seen it, Godard couldn't resist tracking us to death. Belmondo walks down a street and we walk with him; he walks, and so do we, he keeps on walking, and so do we, he walks some more, and so do we. Where? Oh, well, now that you ask, nowhere, but don't you think it's kinda cute and all? THEN, wait for it, a masterstroke. Belmondo walks TOWARDS us, and we move backwards, he walks towards us some more, and we back away, he keeps on walking, and we keep backing away. Why? Search me, pal. There are probably less than fifty shots in the whole megillah. The reason he does this, of course, is simple. He can't cut. He doesn't know thing one about Editing, wouldn't know a pic-synch or a movieola if it bit him in the ass. So that when he DOES try a cut, it's a JUMP cut, does nothing but draw the attention to this Amateur Night farrago. More? You want MORE. Okay, there's more. What's the test of a good, not even GREAT, just good movie, book, play. It's this. The CHARACTERS seem REAL, the situations seem REAL, you have the feeling when you close the book, leave the theatre or the cinema that you're leaving REAL PEOPLE behind and that if you could somehow sneak back in at three in the morning you'd find those characters still there, still getting on with their lives. Try telling that to Godard, or fellow pseud Truffaut, so dismissive of REAL film makers, who had a hand in what is laffingly called the screenplay. There is not a SINGLE character from the first frame to the last in Breathless who we can care about, who we can BELIEVE. It's Fantasy Island, folks, in spades. If you're a disciple of the Marquis de Sade then run, don't walk to this merde.You'll love it. -10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I truly wish this movie had never been made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OVERRATED "ART FILM" ALERT: The following film is adored by sophisticated and "with it" film fans. The fact that the average person may find the whole thing unfunny and bland is due to their just not being smart enough to understand and appreciate this masterpiece.While this is not a terrible film, part of me wishes this film had never been made. After all, this was the "granddaddy" of all French New Wave films and it ushered in many, many self-indulgent films that were proclaimed "art" despite the fact that they often deliberately used shoddy production values and were disliked by the ordinary person because they "just didn't get it"--yeah, right. This elitism was really just an excuse to make lousy films that, on occasion, really, really made no sense. While the movie's writer, Truffaut, went on to far better things--actually making some very good New Wave films, the success of this film encouraged Jean-Luc Godard to make worse films--such as ALPHAVILLE, PIERRE LE FOU, A WOMAN IS A WOMAN and FIRST NAME: CARMEN. All these films shared common denominators in that they made very little sense, had rotten camera-work and featured people that the average sane person could care less about as their stories unfolded. Oddly enough, Truffaut and Godard got their show business start as film critics who hated traditional French movies. They began making films that deliberately violated conventions and, at times, sensibilities.My biggest problem with BREATHLESS in particular is that I truly hated the central character. Once again, Jean-Paul Belmondo plays a real self-centered jerk (what I actually want to call his character is a lot less pleasant, but kids also read these reviews). There is NOTHING redeemable about the man--he steals car after car, murders a cop and lies almost every time he opens his mouth. Plus, he just seems cocky and unlikable. How Jean Seberg's character can even stand to be around him makes absolutely no sense.A second problem, and it was deliberately done by Godard, is the annoying edits he sometimes made. He deliberately made some scenes choppy and wanted the scene to appear very choppy. Well, if bad camera-work was his goal, why didn't he just film the movie in a coal mine or put his hand over the lens! These would make about as much sense and annoy the public just as well.The third problem is that the film is very, very, very talky and dull. For a major portion of the film, the central characters lie in bed and talk and talk about pretty much nothing. Yes, I know that IS the point of FRENCH NEW WAVE in many cases, but it makes for a terrible film.The only good thing about the film was a reference to "Bob the gambler". I assume this is a reference to the 1955 French Film Noir film BOB LE FLAMBEUR--especially since they also say that Bob is now in jail (that's how the movie BOB LE FLAMBEUR ended). This is a cute "inside joke" to an exceptional French film.By the way, I actually saw the film twice. Once, years ago and just yesterday because I thought it MUST have been better than I remembered it. Considering how I have trashed most Godard films I have reviewed (there are some exceptions), I felt an obligation to see it again just to give it a fair chance. I did and it STILL stank.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic only because it was the first of its kind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A character study about Michel ( Jean-Paul Belmondo ), a young criminal who acts tough and tries to be like Bogart, and Patricia (Jean Seberg), an American who sells the New York Herald- Tribune. Patricia's involvement with him seems to be purely because of her curiosity towards his affection and his strange, comical behavior almost identical to the one which is shown again in "Pierrot le Fou". Jean Seberg's acting is ridiculously dull and her expressions throughout the film are almost as uneventful as the plot of the film itself. Jean- Paul Belmondo's acting on the other hand, although full of style is still unconvincing. You cant really blame him though, his character's persona is just not in any way believable. The level of detachment and obliviousness is simply too extreme. The Film's music is also absolutely horrendous, I doubt I could recall a movie that has a genuinely worse soundtrack.However, the truly disgusting thing about this movie, is the amount of jump cuts Godard forcibly tries to stuff down our throat, it makes me wonder whether the films last lines were really referring to Godard himself.Out of boredom ( due to the films basically non-existent plot ) I couldn't help but resort to wondering whether these extremely disturbing 'jumpcuts' were necessary. The answer, which is also the answer to most French New Wave films is yes and no. If the film did not contain these 'jump cuts', many of them purposely used in the most unconventional way possible, the film would not have its historical importance and status of being revolutionary. The jumps cuts in this Film have no real purpose other than to rebel against cinema norms at the time and attract attention as a result. In other words there was no 'message', 'deeper meaning' or even aesthetic purpose behind them. Its only purpose was to distinguish this film, which without all its pretentious bull would be no more than a boring, poorly written and poorly acted character study, from all the other boring, poorly written and poorly acted character studies. The Film instead is a NEW, DIFFERENT and MODERN boring, poorly written and poorly acted character study. These days the film is met with enthusiasm, mainly because without objective standards, style is valued over substance and originality is valued over genuine merit. Although you cannot deny the historical importance of this film as a cinematic landmark, you can definitely question it. There's no harm in rebelling against norms to create effect but never at the expense of overall enjoyment. Breathless however, simply rebels for shock value and to standout as something new, different and as most New Wave fans would put it 'Bold.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My first Godard..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can see how one can be bored and irritated by Breathless. Do we accept that young people can be pretentious or that they try to be cool or struggle with love in superficial ways, I think it all boils down to this. If not, Breathless is a film to hate.This was like a monk's vow to me, never to see a Godard film. I knew I would eventually (or rather had to, because I want to be able to criticize my dislikes) but I wasn't keen on it. It wasn't the New Wave that bothered me (the Nuberu Bagu I adore) but Godard himself, everything I read by or about him annoyed me, "intellectually counterfeit money" in Herzog's words, radicalism that advertises itself as a fashion item, and none of the films sounded interesting. Probably very appropriate for the film I saw, I saw it because of the most superficial reason imaginable. My girlfriend wants to cut her hair short and the image of Jean Seberg walking down the Champs-Élysées immediately came to mind, I showed her pictures and she practically made me watch it with her. Women! So, Breathless.. I lament the fact that it has been selected to be a film school movie for 18 year olds to begin to learn something about important cinema, it's a film that has 20k votes when it should have a quarter of that. Naturally this visibility attracts viewers who have little business watching this kind of film in the first place and a lot of the criticism I read about it is terribly short-sighted and reactionary. It's easy to react to Breathless but I decided I wouldn't play into it, even a film by my nemesis deserves better.First thing I noticed and prepared myself to dislike is that Breathless doesn't feel important things, it says them. It's a film of outward appearances. But Belmondo doesn't just look into a photo of Humphrey Bogart, he looks into a mirror and hopes to see a reflection of himself, and Jean Seberg doesn't just look like Rita Hayworth in The Lady from Shangai, she behaves like a movie star, they both do and the movie behaves like a movie. This not just the skewed reflection of a Monogram potboiler, it's the image that wants to look into the mirror of Hollywood but not see the reflection. It wants another one for itself, Godard creates this. What perfunctory gangster plot there is to the film is a meaningless boyhood fantasy.This is okay for me but there were films aware of themselves before Breathless just like there was New Wave before Godard. What intrigues me here is the breach with visual narrative, how the Eiffel tower is not established, it's seen passingly through the glass of a moving car. And more, that the film seems to gradually become aware that a certain kind of story is being played out in it and begins to spot the anomaly. Flashing signs in the street tell us that Michel Poiccard's arrest is imminent and the protagonists read about it from the newspaper. It's like the movie is pointing out to itself the presence of story while it's preoccupied with something entirely different.But I'm not sure the film is even about that, if Godard is aware of the meta-narrative. As some of the myopic criticism of the film I read points out, Breathless is silly, pretentious, about nothing. A couple of instances of dialogue made me groan, but what I take from it is that Breathless is a youth film that does not address youth after the fact, it's made by them, in their image. Michel and Patricia are silly because they're young, they pretend, rebel or conform, make sweeping judgements on love and death, they make faces or look under skirts, and whether Godard means it or not, he expresses himself as a young artist. There's pretension in that but it's the time to be pretentious. I'm still wary of how Godard would go on to grow up or whether he styled himself in that image and refused to, but this wasn't as bad I feared. As for hope, I didn't have any for it, so I'm not sorry I saw it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie for the first time. Granted, it must have amazed spectators when it first came out, but I found it to be quite annoying and I had a hard time watching it all the way through.It felt to me as though the author of the film, whoever it was, had some kind of unexplainable "thing" for America, represented here by Jean Seberg. But, it's not really America we're talking about, but it's what the author knows of America (Bogart, Thunderbirds, Cadillacs, Westerns, Eisenhower, etc.). I believe that if all the American references had been made to things French (Jean Gabin, Citroen, Charles de Gaulle for instance), and if the Jean Seberg role had been played by a French actress, the movie would have been extremely banal and would have never gotten the notice that it got. Much like if the title role in "Chocolat" had been played by Courteney Cox.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Godard once said that no medium can catch the truth. Reckless is an example of capturing the honesty in film. Godard came to reject the ideology of naturalism. He felt that a correct view of reality had to be created. The only authentic and artistic realism in films was the truth behind the appearance of what films tried to show as the truth. Godard held nothing back in his work and in 1960, Godard revealed to the world a new way of movie making with the release of Reckless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film That Resurrected French Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Bout De Souffle/Breathless(1959) was the film that gave birth to an era known as The French New Wave. The five most important periods in the second half of 20th Century cinema are The Czech New Wave, The French New Wave, The German New Wave, The Japanese New Wave, and The Russian New Wave. Breathless(1959) is about the alienation of youth and the desire to live fast and die young. Its about a young man who's on the run after accidently killing a Police officer. He meets an American girl and falls in love with her.Breathless(1959) is a tragic fable of a doomed relationship that ends in betrayal. Plays tribute to Humphrey Bogart, Fritz Lang, Film Noir, Sam Fueller, and Jean Pierre Melville. The film is very knowledgable when it comes to early cinema history and art history. Jean Paul Belmondo is cool as the fatalistic Michel. Its way better then the remake starring Richard Gere.Themes presented in Breathless(1959) would reappear in other Godard films as in My Life to Live(1962), Band of Outsiders(1964), Pierrot Le Fou(1965), and La Chinoise(1967). Throughout this movie are many references to different great works of art, cinema, literature, and music. The late Jean Seberg does splendidly in her debut as the American girl who falls in love with Michel. This film has been disowned by Godard after he went into his Maoist period. I think that Jean Luc Godard disowns Breathless(1959) because its more a Truffaut type of film then it is Godard.Breathless is based on a story by Godard's then close friend and fellow film maker, Francois Truffaut. Michel Poiccard seems to be a little like Truffaut and some parts of the film are a little autobiographical. Godard hero, Jean Pierre Melville has a major role as a Policeman. Breathless(1959) is a big influence of Melville's masterful, Le Samourai(1967). Claude Chabrol is another French New Waver who got involved on this movie by doing Production Design.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is perfect. It opens with a shot of the lead character pulling himself out of the paper; as if he is coming to life from the news he reads. And then right away he commits a murder. How perfect is this? He doesn't stop to think but just does something. He takes a life and then for the rest of the movie tries to convince his girlfriend to runaway with him.What does the title mean? I realize Breathless is the English translation, but breath is the basis of life and this is what the movie is about: life, love, and the lack of both. It is thus ironic that the thief chain-smokes, polluting his own breath as he gasps for air, the fuel of his very own existence!And when he finds a gun, the taker of life/breath, he isn't shocked or put off, he just accepts the gun for what it is, rolls down the window, looks at the trees, sees the sun, and shoots it. Genius. He is trying to shoot the sun - the essence of life itself, the very provider of his own breath! Genius!See this movie at least twice and pay attention to the groundbreaking editing! When the thief and his girlfriend are driving, the film cuts to *same* angle shot of the girl, literally showing the fragmented nature of their relationship. He is trying to fuse the gaps between them, but does it work? See this movie!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Godard's Jazzy Groundbreaker Still Packs a Punch and Gets the Luxuriant Criterion Treatment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the forefront of the French New Wave along with François Truffaut ("The 400 Blows"), Alain Resnais ("Hiroshima, Mon Amour"), and Louis Malle ("Elevator to the Gallows"), Jean-Luc Godard broke all the rules in his 1960 directorial debut with a story borne out of American B-movie conventions but revitalized by his free-form narrative, hand-held camera-work (by Raoul Coutard) and jazz-infused editing style. On the surface, it seems like a standard young couple-on-the-run adventure, but Godard upends the predictability of the situation with a fresh, documentary-style perspective that emphasizes youthful impulses over morality lessons. Some of its fresh, brazen novelty has worn off over the years, but there is no denying its propulsive energy.The plot is deceptively simple. Michel Poiccard is a young, small-time criminal with a Bogart fixation, living for the moment and taking what he needs with no consideration for the possible consequences. His one obsession is Patricia Franchini, a pixyish New Yorker who lives in Paris and works part-time for the New York Herald Tribune. Michel steals a car in Marseilles and drives to Paris to see her again. On the way, however, he shoots a motorcycle cop with a gun found in the glove compartment of the stolen car. As the police close in on Michel, he holes up in Patricia's apartment and tries to convince her to run away with him to Rome. Godard wrote the script based on a story by Truffaut, and the plot emphasis is placed squarely on the dynamic between Michel and Patricia, especially in a lengthy dialogue scene in her apartment. The thriller aspects seem secondary until the last half-hour and the memorably bitter ending.In his breakthrough role, Jean-Paul Belmondo captures Michel's surly, amoral nature with a certain magnetic quality that announces his arrival. As the fashionably enigmatic Patricia, Jean Seberg was just 21 but had already been burned by Hollywood thanks to her mechanical performances in two Otto Preminger films, "Saint Joan" and "Bonjour Tristesse". She still strikes me a blank slate here, but it seems to work for the story because the viewer is left wondering what motivates her devotion to him and her final act of absolution. The two-disc 2007 Criterion Collection DVD set is as impressive as expected for the film's aficionados. Beyond a fairly pristine print of the movie, Disc One includes the original French trailer and 27-minutes worth of vintage interviews with Godard, Belmondo, Seberg, and director Jean-Pierre Melville (he has a memorable cameo as a pretentious author. Surprisingly, there is no commentary track from a film scholar, the usual supplement for special Criterion releases.Disc Two has the lion's share of the extras. There are recent interviews with Coutard and assistant director Pierre Rissient, as well as a ten-minute interview with documentary filmmaker D.A. Pennebaker and his brief experience working with Godard. Seberg gets special attention in an eighteen-minute film essay that covers her tragic life and career, and another essay, "Breathless as Criticism" has Chicago Reader film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum explaining the significance of the film for a new generation. There is a 78-minute documentary from 1993, "Chambre 12, Hotel de Suede" that traces the original film locales. Interviews with Belmondo, Coutard, and technical adviser Claude Chabrol are also included. Finally, there is a twelve-minute comedy short from 1959, "Charlotte et son Jules" co-starring Godard and Belmondo. A comprehensive eighty-page booklet accompanies the set.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intriguing and influential crime/romance drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The part that Jean Luc-Godard played in The French New Wave was tremendous. This film, with its innovative jump-cuts, catapulted Godard into international fame. His film, Breathless, as well as collaborator Francois Truffaut's The 400 Blows, put the New Wave on the map for good. Breathless, like Truffaut's masterpiece, is a mysteriously beautiful film. Jean-Paul Belmondo plays Michel Poiccard, alias Laszlo Kovacs, a french criminal running from the police. He meets with his lover, Patricia Franchini, played by Jean Seberg, in Paris, where she works for a newspaper. The film focuses on the dynamics of their relationship, or rather, their lack of a relationship. One of the most famous lines in the film explains it best: "When we talked, I talked about me, you talked about you, when we should have talked about each other." Considering that this is Michel saying this to Patricia adds so much more to the revelation. Michel is a small, somewhat odd-looking fellow who despises fear and loves sex and movies. In one scene, Michel stands in front of a poster of Humphrey Bogart, from The Harder They Fall. This is just one example of the methods Godard uses of foreshadowing Michel's fate. Patricia is an intellectual, interested in art, music, and literature. She is the more mature one of the two, contemplating the deeper meanings of life and love, while Michel is only concerned about sex and money. Belmondo and Seberg have an interesting chemistry together, very much like Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway in Bonnie and Clyde (1967). The dialog is brilliantly witty and Martial Solal's moody, jazzy theme is somewhat reminiscent of a Thelonious Monk recording. The jump-cuts brought a new technique to the screen, but I can't say that they are done particularly well here. Granted, Godard, practically hacked away at his film with a pair of scissors to shorten the length of the film, thus happening upon what would become a new technique. Overall, Breathless is an enjoyable romantic crime drama, with the style of a film noir, and a twist at the end that leaves its audience Breathless!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Breathless seems a lesser movie today than when it was first released. Its beatnik philosophical musings, reinterpreted Hollywood B-movie cliches and frenetic editing were original and provocative in 1960. Viewed from today's perspective however, the philosophy is naive and quaint, the tactic of referring to other films within a film has become commonplace, and the overly-clever editing seems like gimmickry. It's just not fresh any more. Of course that won't stop it from inspiring a never ending stream of turgid undergraduate essays.</fullReview>

A huge hit when first released, this movie catapulted the French New Wave and Godard. Upon it's initial release this film was viewed by critics as a realistic depiction of the nihilism of Parisain youth. This however was not the case. A bout de souffle, which translates to 'an attack of suffocation' has been called a filmed piece of film criticism. Godard took worn out American and French clich?s and fashioned a new type of film making out of them. The key to understanding and ultimately fully appreciating this movie lies in figuring out how the movie works. This leaves the success of the film for the viewer, on the viewer. 10/10.</fullReview>

The genius of Godard makes us become attached to Belmondo character since the very beginning of the feature, even if we know that he's insolent, scoundrel, debauched, but still a very nice person, we dont want that anything bad happen to him, because what is the most important thing we see in him , is that he loves life. Belmondo delivers a powerful performance which actually generated a new person, a brand new stereotype in cinema, by the device of a certain improvised acting, the image of a fellow, cigarette in mouth, hat on the tip of the head, a cynic character , always answering back with irony and irrefutable lucidity . A direction of a stunning virtuosity of a vivid offhanded, cam on shoulder , sensational and bitter dialogues , nervous and precise editing . Thrilling , ? BOUT DE SOUFFLE leaves us out of breath .

		<shortDescription>An aesthetic and stylish avant-garde masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>? bout de souffle is an extremely complicated film. We could tackle its analysis form different points of view, although I think the most interesting is that of the aesthetic evolutions of Godard's cinema.We will begin however by talking about the story and characters of the film. Truffaut collaborated with Godard writing an everyday story about a sexy scrounger and criminal played by Belmondo that turns out to be the story of his last days. In this story is strongly implicated an American girl, the object of Michel Poiccard' s passion and an important key for the development of the story, as well as some other side characters that act as a background. The story of Poiccard's chase and death is just an excuse to put a dramatic end to a series of situations in which the main character finds himself and in which Truffaut's script twists and turns and aesthetic art by Godard find their way. I do not find any specially interesting characteristic of the story, except maybe for the context in which it takes place: Paris in the late 50s, and the bohemian and charming life of an American student and a French rogue together. Characters are a step ahead. Although they star in a common story, they are amazingly complex and rich, and so is the relationship between them. Michel and Patricia are the only two main characters and their relationship is the real core of the film. I would say there is a lot of surrealism in the way they act, talk and react. Both of them, but specially Michel, act like children, their humor go up and down and sprinkle incoherent and confused comments. The long 27-minute take in Patricia's bedroom shows us a dazzling conversation in which both characters change positions, play around (covering themselves with the blankets, , for example), talk about trivialities (the posters, the ashtrays) or really deep things (Faulkner thoughts) and pull faces and do body language (the lips gestures or the mocking faces in the mirror). This, together with the action expression by Godard about which we will talk later, make this scene quite interesting. Although it is so long, it is not boring. As we have said before in the scene they talk about many different things, but action spins around a core topic: sex. Michel desires Patricia and turns around her like an animal, but a charming one. I like how sex is treated with ambiguity: let us remember the first scene in which Michel visits the script girl: they have most probably had a relationship before and she is getting changed in front him, a sexually-appealing scene when she is backwards. However, nothing happens, Godard only wants to insinuate. Another beautiful and sensual image is that in Patricia's room: when she just arrives, Michel is lying on the bed, looking at her, and she opens the window and we can see her silhouette against the light from the street. Godard goes on with ambiguous scenes, and he shows us the first kiss between Michel and Patricia, but we do not know if it has been a real kiss or not, it is kind of unreal. We will later realize that they have had sex. Thus, we have Michel, a machist but charming man obsessed with Patricia, and we have Patricia, the American girl, extremely beautiful and tempting, she is independent but also weak. She is more complicated as a character than Michel is. She is not sure: she makes out with the American journalist, shows resistance to Michel but finally yields, however, she does not know if she loves him. And when she feels a little bit pressured by the police, she gives him away. There is another character I liked: the writer that is interviewed in the airport: he states controversial opinions about love, women and life which I cannot help connecting with Michel's way of life. Maybe we could take this writer as an intellectual alter ego of him? In fact, Patricia seems very interested in him.What I most enjoyed in the film was the vanguard treatment that Godard gives to action. I firstly thought of a kind of audiovisual cubism. Cubism in painting shows reality deconstructed in many different sights of a same object. In his film, Godard breaks up space a temporal continuity to show us what he wants us to see. This has amazing aesthetic effects. He uses it in the car trips: Michel's car and the taxi, to give a sensation of movement, of travel. At the end, there is a moment when Michel interrupts her talking, and the continuity is also interrupted, giving a very vivid effect. Finally, camera movements are as excellent as those of Godard's comrade in the New Wave, Truffaut. Particularly amazing is a 720 degree turn of the camera in the scene where the French policeman first talks to Patricia in the store.</fullReview>

Nothing much happens.From a theatrical perspective, however, it is indeed a work of genius. Like any modern play that you'd go see, it's not about where it's going, but how it gets there. Or is it? Thought provoking and fascinating. Your life should be this cool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the last genuine celebrations of youth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By Aaron Dumont **** (out of four)Screw 'The Jazz Singer'--one of the few genuine revolutions of cinema can be found here; Breathless is the 30's-hipster-esque precursor to Wong Kar-Wai and Antonioni--it is a kinetic tour de force film that, much like Antonioni's own inflammatory Zabriskie Point(less, as some say) and his meta-classical-oddity L'eclisse, gains momentum as it whirs through circuitous colloquy, modern babble, and revolutionary metaphysical pivots. As well as that, the film, just like Hong Kong's hue-saturated auteur Kar-Wai's masterfully structured, humane, moving-Impressionist-portraits, is one few that purely encapsulates, if detachedly fractures, a whole romance within a short hour-or-so. The two protagonists, two lovers, might as well be real--they tease, laugh, learn, talk, live, love, hate, betray...they are both universal and forcible--they don't spew quirky one-liners and haul, even heave their alienating, stereotypical personalities and petty, melodramatic social-cum-crisis; something that sadly cannot be said for films today. Main character Patricia Franchini said it best: "Informers inform, burglars burgle, murderers murder, and lovers love."The premise renders simple at first greeting; Michel, a man running from the law after killing a policeman, runs off to be with his beautiful girlfriend, Patricia. It's a smidgen-bit tawdry, kitschy way to craft something belonging to such a medium known for such great artistry, and it has been seen many times before here and there.And then they talk to each other.Their deep arguments of hate, happiness, unhappiness, freedom and love is a sweeping one. Their nature is sophisticated; they are disenchanted freelancers in a caustically desolate atmosphere that feels terrifying, quite simply unfair--but life assuring. Every second of the film gains an increasingly cosmic breath and life, and the relationships grow more and more in dynamic intimacy. By the closing minutes, everything is romantically vigorous, fizzing with verve, and leaves you--and I say this truthfully, not as a referential pun to the title name; breathless, but alas, this ravishing, self-reflexive, self-devouring mood mix abruptly ends with a great bang.With the ending, which I won't spoil, a quasi-comedy ends in full-on-tragedy in one of the most iconic, penetrating, devastating and embodying scenes in cinema--to make a great romance is pure magic today, and people must realize that budgets, stars, black and white are all superfluous and overestimated for the outcome of the film--sometimes, all you need is a bit of love and a lot of thinking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although moist of the films that I watch derive from Japan, China, or South Korea, I have decided in recent months that I want to expand the number of movies that I watch from Western countries. While I still have a hard time stomaching a number of American films, I have been watching a few French films that I have enjoyed. I found Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Samoura? to be quite outstanding and I enjoyed Catherine Breillat's Fat Girl. Also, being that my nearby independent DVD rental place carries many of his films, I have rented a few of Godard's films. The first one I watched was Band of Outsiders which I found to be quite enjoyable, but the next two films, Tout va bien and Contempt left me quite cold, the former because I found it to be pretentious schlock and the latter because simply I was not in the mood to watch the film. I did enjoy Masculin féminin: 15 faits précis though although, at first, I thought it was a bit pretentious as well. Another film that I watched was Godard's debut feature length film ? bout de soufflé or Breathless.Now, I am far from an expert when it comes to French film, but I understood that Breathless was the film that set off the French New Wave of cinema and that it and Godard also had a major impact on Japanese New Wave directors such as Oshima Nagisa and Imamura Shohei. If this is truly the case or not is not important, what is important though is that this film has had such an impact on not just French film, but it supposedly revolutionized film-making in general. However, while watching the film the first time, all I could think was "what is the big deal?" Breathless tells the story of Michel Poiccard, a young car thief who lives day by day engaging in petty crimes and trying to sleep with as many women as possible. One day Poiccard is spotted speeding by a cop on a motorcycle. Being that he is in a stolen car at the time, Poiccard shoots the policeman and hurries off to Paris. Broke, Poiccard tries to get money from his girlfriends who include the twenty-year old American Patricia Franchini who works as a journalist. Poiccard desires Patricia to hurry off to Rome with him, but without money this is nothing more than a pipedream. With the police hot on his trail, how much time does Poiccard have and does Patricia truly want to go with him and, although she is supposedly pregnant with his child, does she truly love him? Supposedly one of the key points of Godard's style of filming was the importance hand-held cameras played in that they were used on location and removed the making of the film from the studio so it lost some of the overly slick look of films made in the studio. Also Godard's use of jump shots is to be noted as well as the film's slick jazz soundtrack. Does all of this equal an enjoyable film? I think it leads to a passable one with some good moments and a film that opened doors for the New Wave of film sweeping France.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Big Bang of the French New Wave.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the root of all modern indie film-making. It is existential without being religious. It is lofty and poetic without being aethereal. It is, simply, the first attempt to show the dichotomy of modern life through film.It depicts a life where philosophers and thus in turn common thinkers, have attained a level of such balanced morality that while right and wrong form a large gray area, good and evil are very clear cut and such is the very definition of modern times.The fact that Kovacs (the main character) is a criminal, that is, the fact that he steals to survive comfortably in this world, is never portrayed as an evil characteristic. However, when he kills it is. This may seem like a contradiction, but if you think like an existentialist it is not. Stealing is in one way or another, "earning a living," and in fact many people who maintain "legal" professions are guilty of it as well, yet it is overlooked by our government and society. So the fact that the film remains playful when Kovacs plots to, and actually commits the act of stealing should come as no surprise, simply because society has evolved to accept these types of criminals as human. However, once you become a murderer, you become something else other than just a human. You have tasted death, without being subjected to death.What makes the movie even more interesting is the fact that the main character is in love. Nothing could be more human than love, and that forces the viewer to forget his sins and take pity on him, for he is struggling to be loved back. This is the genius of the films story because this scenario raises the question of fate. Do one's actions effect something called "karma" to the point where you can be doomed to eternal damnation or blessed with eternal bliss? Of course the films objective is not to answer these questions, because who could prove the answer one way or another: we do not see the actions of an almighty hand, if such a thing even exists. It's objective is to simply pose the question so that debate will ensue, and what ever decision one makes based on that debate will in turn determine the fate of the world. It is important to note that the films rhetoric does not dismiss, or even question, the existence of fate, just that we create our own fate through our own actions. Which is of course one of the ultimate existential questions.Although the film seems to provide an answer, it denies a conclusive interpretation of that question because we never know if Kovacs was in fact redeemed in life or death, by capturing the heart of his female counterpart.All this makes the film the first post-modern story on the movie screen, and this fact is of course reinforced by the technical aspects of the film. The jump cuts, never before seen on screen, completely hand-held cinematography, renegade low-budget production, all contributions to this film's qualification as the original post0modern classic.This film is simply the most important indie film and the number one must-see for all critics, autuers and aspiring autuers of indie film. No question.It is also noteworthy that all of Jean-Luc Goddard's films are variations upon the same theme, each beautifully and differently played out.</fullReview>

The movie is stimulating in all aspects. It makes you think, feel, and wonder. What makes us love? How are we sure we are, in fact, in love? The scenes between Belmondo and Seberg are beautifully and intimately done. Seberg radiates on the screen and Belmondo as a Bogart fanatic is a brilliant touch as well. To disregard the French as filmmakers is a huge mistake, thanks in part to directors like Godard. A fantastic movie for all fans of cinema.</fullReview>

Its characters, script and performances are superb. And the story is surprisingly modern. There are some films that lose credibility with the time, that's something impossible for this one because it's a very generic and elemental story. I like very much that movies where the characters, are more important that the plot (like Pulp Fiction). And I think that's the secret of an unforgettable film.For those who wants to explore the elemental principles of the story-telling and the film-making, this one is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Godard's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The French directors at this time do not due complete dependence on appearance primal but the narrative has more meaning, psychologically speaking. An ending of a French New Wave film is not typical Hollywood: the closing of the picture would be completely unexpected like Michel's ?tongue in cheek' demise. Therefore in simple terms: Hollywood is a nursery tale for adults, a traditional narrative structure is essential, as is the notion of hero and villain. Whereas French New Wave investigates humanity and the circumstances of life, it is high art, quite different to the popular culture of America of the time. Godard uses real time as we see Michel walking calmly down a flight of stairs leading to an underpass. The audience watch him blend in with the environment and the camera pans right to patiently wait upon the Arc d'Triomphe for roughly four or five seconds. Before the audience starts wondering about Michel's whereabouts, the camera pans right again to complete about ninety degrees to witness Michels's miraculous arrival on the other side of the road. This amazing piece of camerawork is genuinely astonishing because it demonstrated his perfect choreographic skills down to the split second. Interestingly Truffaut while directing 400 Blows (a reflection on his earlier years) showed a personal touch, which is sad and endearing. A scene at the climax of the film shows him reaching the sea and as he helplessly turns to look at camera, and as the camera closes in on his distraught face we realise he has no where to go, his environment becoming his eternal trap...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a purely visceral experience, worthwhile...but don't look for substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jean-Luc Godard's New Wave romantic-drama, credited with starting a newly-raw and exciting cycle in French cinema, involves Jean-Paul Belmondo as a thief on the run from police. He finds security with moody American girlfriend Jean Seberg, looking lovely in a pixie haircut, though seeming just a bit out of her element here. The crisp black-and-white film is one hundred percent atmosphere-atmosphere-atmosphere, and it looks good enough to eat. However, there's hardly much of a plot (which was the point, after all) and it won't be intriguing to viewers looking for a logical narrative. Godard's style broke fresh ground in 1960--and the charisma can still felt, though it was rarely duplicated (an American remake in 1983 was a disaster). ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jean-Luc Godard, the director of this film, was a revolutionary in his approach to the way French cinema was evolving into; it can be seen as the influence for the movement that was known as "New Wave". Godard, like the rest of his colleagues wanted to transform the way movies were seen. In fact, most of the directors of the New Wave movement felt that style and presentation were more important than the traditional narrative that was widely used up to that point.Godard, brought the camera into the streets of Paris, something that was imitated by everyone. His characters are secondary to the mood he created. The story, with its many detours of the main idea, shows more of the atmosphere Mr. Godard created around the characters of Michel and Patricia. It's hard to imagine the attraction of the young American for this tough guy, but maybe because of the aura he projects, attracted her to what might be perceived as a dangerous involvement.Michel Poiccard is a petty criminal with a long history of wrong doing. For him Patricia represents a fruit he hasn't tasted and once he has a bite out of it, he is hooked. When Patricia tells him she suspects she is pregnant, he takes the news with apparent surprise, even though it appears he is the only man in her life. Deep down, the cool Michel is a desperate man. Michel seems to be impressed by the American movie stars of the times, especially Humphrey Bogart, whose picture he examines on one of the movie houses where he passes. In spite of his coolness, Michel knows his good luck could end at any given moment. That is why he clings to Patricia because he feels secure with her."Breathless" was filmed in the streets of Paris. Raoul Coutard, the cinematographer, used a hand held camera for most shots. The film was shot in daylight, as Godard detested lighting what he was going to shoot thus making everything look natural and unprepared. The jazzy score is by Martial Solal.Jean-Paul Belmondo was not a handsome man by movie star standards, and yet, he has such a presence that he is hard to dismiss as the most important element that holds the film together. Jean Seberg, on the other hand, cast a youthful and wholesome aura on her Patricia that she appears to be the right actress for playing the part. Other uncredited cameos include the director, himself, Philippe DeBroca, and Jean-Pierre Melville, among others."Breathless" influence can be traced to a score of other movies that came behind it. It is a tribute to Jean-Luc Godard's early genius that made this film the classic that it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course this movie is well known for it's stylish and experimental editing that changed film history forever. But many people don't realize that it has a meaning, quite a Nietzschian meaning. The gangster plot is only an excuse. Michel is the only sympathized person in the film, although he is totally immoral, untalented and his only ambition is to go to Italy. That's because he is always cheerful in what he does. Unlike the masses, he recognizes the meaninglessness of existence but he is happy with it anyway, and decides to live dangerously. Patricia is tempted to follow him, but isn't brave enough, so she calls the police. All the over people look like complete idiots or zombies. Especially the two policeman look ridiculous. In the sixties most of those who recognized the anarchic meaning of the movie where the ones who didn't accept it, mostly in the conservative American audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My suggestion is that you begin watching "Breathless" with minimum expectations and a massive amount of caffeine in your system. I suppose that in order to meet the "minimum expectations" part of the previous suggestion, you might have to quit reading this review, go see the movie, and come back here later.No, seriously, go.OK, still here? Good. Now, I don't have much of a background in the French New Wave - my thought is that many people use "Breathless" as an introduction to the French films of the '60s. Fair enough - it's among the more accessible pieces I've seen in my limited exploration, although not as rigorously inventive or well-made as a movie like Godard's "My Life to Live" or a couple of others. Some of the film's charm comes from its majestic documentary-style shots of Paris cityscapes, which are wonderful but not entirely so different from a PBS travelogue.What it IS, on the other hand, is one of the more fascinating, nihilistic, romantic films ever made. Michel and Patricia, the doomed semi-couple at the heart of the film, are two of the least appealing human beings ever to take up screen time. Michel, a petty thief who kills a cop at the beginning of the movie, is irritatingly pretentious, manipulative, and amorally violent in a way that the film does not excuse so much as shrug at. Patricia, an American student, is vapid, overly compliant, and completely capricious in her decisions - she seems to spend most of the film demanding attention from Michel while completely avoiding any sort of commitment or meaningful connection. This having been said, these are among the most believable characters I've ever seen, despite their irredeemable awfulness. Part of this is that both actors are extraordinarily, uniquely attractive - Belmondo looks like a French Kennedy, while Jean Seberg is - well, she's Jean Seberg in "Breathless". She's like a composite model of cool, cosmopolitan beauty. My point is, though, that the characters make sense as Godard's vision of how some beautiful people act - the sense of entitlement that comes along with having immense surface charm.The movie's piece de resistance, of course, is the 20-minute long conversation that Michel and Patricia have in and out of bed in Patricia's apartment. It's a movie unto itself, a mix of hipster non sequitirs and emotional gamesmanship that takes on a kinetic quality - if there's a more watchable conversation scene outside of a few Woody Allen movies, I guess I haven't seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A VERY Mediocre And VERY Amateurish Film!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankly, I think Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless (1960) is VERY overrated. This is just a very amateurish first attempt at filmmaking for Goddard.That Jean-Paul Belmondo's character would murder a cop and then stick around Paris to get nabbed is unreal. Not even a DUMB criminal is DUMB enough to do that, especially since this guy has the means to flee the country and he is portrayed as a career criminal type with street savvy.Jean Seberg's character is portrayed as an upscale, educated aspiring American journalist who is trying to make it in Paris, yet hooks up with an obvious low life like Jean-Paul's character? SORRY, but I just don't buy it. That she sticks around with Jean-Paul's character even after discovering his criminal nature is even more unbelievable.OK, Jean's character finally smartens up at the end and turns in Jean-Paul's character to the cops. But then what does she do? She goes back to this low life thug and tells him what she did !!!! Either this gal has a latent suicidal wish or she is unbelievably STUPID. Why would any rational person go back to tell a fugitive on the run from a cop killer charge that she just ratted him out? Especially, since it puts her alone in in an apartment with this guy. UNREAL !!!! Then there's the final scene where jean's character is running down the street toward Jean-Paul's character's bullet riddled body is lying face down in the street. I mean, she actually still cares for this cold blooded cop killer even after he's righteously dead? GIVE ME A BREAK !!!! This film is just a love story from outer space, in my opinion. This film isn't about romance, it's about two DUMB people, just acting DUMB.I mean I've seen a number of Absurdist / Avant Garde films that I thought were great because the unreal / absurd elements in the film had some sort of symbolic or interpretive meaning in the context of the whole film. Breathless, however, is a film with a basically unbelievable, not well thought out storyline that just has no symbolic or interpretive meaning at all, at least for me.Although Goddard went on to make many great films, his initial effort here was a BIG FLOP as far as I'm concerned and the acclaim that Breathless got in its time was due to Goddard's already gotten fame as a film critic for a very influential Parisian film review and nothing more. That's the only sense that I can make of why such a MEDIOCRE film would get such high ratings.{{{This review is also posted at "Forum For Film Reviews And Discussions" at groups.google.com.}}</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Breathless", Jean-Luc Godard's debut, IS a very interesting movie and I can see why it's considered a classic and a landmark. But influential doesn't mean great ? as new approach to film-making doesn't mean masterpiece ? I felt there was something very experimental, like a movie from a student who intentionally uses the most innovative techniques just to impress (to trick ?) the audience with something new. Well it did work on that level, but all style and no script don't make a movie work: it needs to have more substance, a solid narrative structure, a story, something that engages me or makes me feel for a character.If a movie dares to challenge my intelligence with something new, and please me visually, it doesn't prevent it from providing a little emotion, a heart in the story or something to make you 'enjoy' what you're watching. In other words, a movie has to 'entertain' too : to thrill, to scare, to make you cry, think, laugh, escape etc, even the most intelligent, stylish and complex directors made entertaining movies : Huston, Hitchcock, Clouzot, Kubrick, Kurosawa, Leone, Lumet etc.OK, I got it, "Breathless" paved the way for a new kind of cinema, the New Wave but I think it worked better with American directors because they never forgot to have a solid script and add an entertainment value to their movies. Look at New Hollywood movies like "Bonnie and Clyde", "The Wild Bunch"," Five Easy Pieces", "Badlands", "Mean Streets", "Midnight Cowboy" ... : as deep and stylish as they were, they never failed to entertain their audience and were very popular On the other hand, Nouvelle Vague French movies were more elitist, more appealing to a bourgeois youth movement rejecting anything 'old', anything from their parent's generation. They even called it with the pompous name of Cinema d'Auteur ... what did that ever mean anyway ? Nouvelle Vague was a fresh air for French Cinema, but was it really better than popular movies like "Diaboliques"," Wages of Fear" or than traditional movies from Jean-Pierre Melville ... who ironically, had a memorable cameo in "Breathless"? I guess we should put this into historical perspective, I'm not calling bourgeois all the fans of "Breathless" but the New Wave fans were mostly the baby-boom generation, they weren't all bourgeois, but it was the most spoiled generation, which for instance, bashed a masterpiece like "Army of Shadows" from Jean-Pierre Melville, because it glorified a figure like De Gaulle and was about traditional themes, like honor and loyalty. And what about "Wages of Fear" ? old guard too? What about other French masterpieces like "Forbidden Games", or"The Trip Across Paris" ? And let's get back to the newness, two years before "Breathless", there was "Shadows": the directorial debut of John Cassavetes. A cool, detached, modern movie with an incredible realistic feeling, jump cuts, improvised dialog, jazzy music etc. This movie isn't famous enough to be considered as a landmark ... but in my book, it is. I loved it, and Godard's movie just didn't leave me with the same feeling. Maybe because I didn't really care for the main character, too cynical and detached, whereas "Shadows" made me more empathic towards the main protagonists, maybe ? I think the New Wave saved Hollywood by inspiring the greatest generation of directors and actors, and the best decade for American movies from 1967 to 1977, but I'm not sure it stood the test of time as well for French Cinema. I respect every director's work ... I just don't think that for the sake of Art, every single element of a movie should be distant from a so-called 'old guard', you can do something fresh with old stuff, as you can make a very complex, intriguing , stylish and intelligent movie with very entertaining material.I don't hate "Breathless", I just take it like the main character, yes he's flamboyant, has a sort of magnetic charisma, but his acts aren't driven by strong motives, it's just a succession of disjointed talking and actions that are supposed to grab us every minute with this "Wooow, this is new" feeling. I got it, it's new, but after 20 minutes, the new wave drowned me already ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I'd like to think that, after two exciting years, I've been well-and-truly inducted into the world of cinema, I'm really still an amateur. I hear the term "French New Wave" and immediately become intimidated. What's it all about? Hand-held photography, jarring jump-cuts and pretentious philosophical musings? It was with some trepidation that I approached Jean-Luc Godard's '? bout de soufflé / Breathless (1960),' supposedly the cornerstone of the French movement, though I was somewhat reassured by a brief plot description that sounded uncannily similar to a modern urban thriller: "a young car thief kills a policeman and tries to persuade a girl to hide in Italy with him." In many ways, 'Breathless' is just like a contemporary film. The hand-held camera-work has a gritty, documentary-like immediacy, and a dynamic freshness that wouldn't arrive in Hollywood cinema for another few years {Sidney Lumet's 'The Pawnbroker (1964)' is the earliest example I can think of}. Stylistically, even recent thrillers like 'Before the Devil Knows You're Dead (2007)' and 'Michael Clayton (2007)' owe a lot to Godard, as curious as that may sound.Both leads are excellent in their respective roles. Jean-Paul Belmondo plays a Humphrey Bogart-wannabe, an out-of-his-depth car thief who speaks tough, but whose brave frontage is immediately transparent. His character works effectively as a semi-affectionate satire of Hollywood's hard-boiled film noir heroes ? ripped from the pages of Hammett, Chandler and Spillane ? who don't actually exist in real life. Jean Seberg, an American actress who only found success after migrating to Europe, is beautiful and sensual as his independent some-time lover, who finds excitement in the notion of a fugitive boyfriend, but has yet to decide if she loves him or not. As far as the romantic subplot is concerned, Godard emphasises the selfishness of his new generation. Love is no longer an intimate and enduring connection between two people, but a succession of lurid and meaningless sexual encounters. Though Michel and Patricia frequently speak their love of each other, their motives are purely egocentric in nature. Each character frequently alludes to their own needs and desires, and Patricia eventually informs on Michel to prove, for her own benefit, that she is indifferent to him.My only previous Godard work, 'Alphaville (1965),' had sufficiently intrigued me with its half-satirical espionage thriller set against a backdrop of science-fiction. However, when the narrative periodically came to a standstill, so too, I found, did my interest in the film. 'Breathless' gave me similar sentiments, albeit to a lesser degree. While never boring, there is a sizable patch in the middle of the film ? in particular, a long scene spent inside Patricia's apartment ? where Michel's status as a wanted man is entirely forgotten. The film's narrative drive comes to a grinding halt, and the two characters are left in limbo. When he's not trying to entice his American companion into bed, Michel raises seemingly arbitrary philosophical questions ? such as, out of nowhere, "do you ever think about death?" ? that apparently serve no purpose other than to justify Godard's film as an important "arthouse" picture. Much has been said about the pioneering use of jump-cuts, a creative trick to trim down the running-time without losing key scenes, but I found the technique unnecessarily jarring and unpalatable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Godard the Guru</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In A Bout de Soufflé, aka Breathless, Jean-Luc Godard explores the unchartered terrain of cinema art. He is one of the leaders of the French new wave (along with Francois Truffaut), a movement during the 50s (if I'm not mistaken) which saved the French cinema from completely patronizing Hollywood classics.Enough of that boring context, let's talk about the film.I can't believe that many people who've seen this didn't take time to look closer and appreciate it. Don't you just realize the ingenious nature of this thing? The characters of Michel and Patricia are well-developed, the former a criminal who deliberately imitates Bogart mannerisms and trademark, the latter an angelic-faced American with a thick accent and sells New York Daily Tribune for a living.The movie is cool. You know, like the laidback, stereotypical cool where most people categorize things, people, and events. This movie is jumpy, because of the use of jump cuts. And they're damn obvious, and they're also damn difficult to edit. Well, the film achieved its desired effect anyhow, which is to deviate from the norms and conventions of the Classicial Hollywood Cinema.The film also uses long takes, especially during the scene of Michel and Patricia on the street while she's selling newspapers while the stupid Michel character is perpetually hitting on her. There's also a 25-minute bedroom conversation scene and it's charming to look at. There's naturalistic acting in this movie. Very naturalistic, if I may say. But the term "naturalistic" is problematic per sé. I'm using this word here to differentiate it from "stylized" acting usually seen in the theater and in comedies.The two lead characters always spit out lines that are seemingly smart, but really dumb. They're both dumb, childish, and nonsensical. Well, Michel can be smart when doing crimes, and Patricia can be smart in acting naive in front of men.I'm just stating the obvious here. But you get my point. This film rocks! Definitely one of the greatest films of all time. It is not only a breakthrough, it is also a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching Jean-Luc Godard's revolutionary French new wave film, it was obvious to me why it is so highly regarded. The techniques used to make the film, such as jump cuts and use of a free floating camera were so unique at the time, yet have been copied so many times by later filmmakers. While the filmmaking was excellent, the movie lacked any real suspense, emotion, or insightful themes. As a piece of pop culture, I'm sure the story was important, but today it just doesn't strike as strongly as it probably did at the time. If I were rating just filmmaking, I would give it four stars, but I can't in good conscience rate it on just the filmmaking. It was an interesting piece to watch, but there was really nothing in it that really made an impact on me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by: Jean-Luc Godard Written by: Jean-Luc Godard and François TruffautThis is fiction, it maybe never happened.One afternoon, Jean-Luc and François were walking out of a theater, where they were screening some of the John Ford's masterpieces. They both had to write a small column about the screenings for "Cahiers du Cin?ma". Suddenly, Jean-Luc stopped in front of one of the teather marquees, there was a photo of Humphrey Boggart there. Jean-Luc said to François: 'I don't know, we all love this kind of films and specially the John Ford movies...' 'Of course,' François said 'they have a established cinematic industry there, and it makes profit.' 'I mean, look at France! What have we made of interest since the 10s? Nothing! We're the creators of film and narrative of films, I mean...' Jean-Luc said as they began walking again. 'Sometimes I think that we just criticize movies now. We should be making them!' François said, waving his arms towards the street. 'We don't need too much money...' thought out loud Jean-Luc, 'the only thing you need for a movie is a gun and a woman.' And as they both walked away, the destiny of filmaking changed forever. A few months later, François Truffaut was beginning the production of his feature film that would be "Les quatre cent coups", Jean-Luc Godard was joyful, but himself couldn't think of a story to shoot. Godard went to Cannes to see his friend's movie. There they talked about how much time had passed since their little chat outside the theater. Then, Truffaut gave Godard a couple of hand-written papers. 'What is this?2 Jean-Luc asked, as he read a quote on the top of the first paper that read "We go talking about strong villain creatures", it was from Stendhall. 'It's your movie,' François said 'I remembered: a gun and a girl, there they are. You must write the script.' Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut hugged. It was the last feature film in which they both could collaborate together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! I saw Godard's Bande A Parte and thought it was over-rated. But, after seeing A bout de soufflé, I'd like to revisit Bande a Parte. This is a truly stylish film and I'm beginning to appreciate Godard's abilities. A lot of what makes it ground-breaking will understandably be dated by modern standards. I mean the Tarantinoesque narrative structure and the visuals - especially the jump cuts which Ridley Scott uses ad nauseum are no longer unique. However, here they look and feel fresh.What really makes A bout de Soufflé relevant even today is the wonderful no-rules narrative structure. A good example: smack in the middle of the film, a good 20 minutes are spend in a bedroom with Belmondo trying to get Seberg to make love and she doesn't want to. Not because she's a prude. In fact, we never really get to know the reason for her reluctance. His method of trying to entice her is by touching her bottom and her method of rejection is a swift slap on his left cheek! There are dozens of visually arresting moments in this film and at a brisk 90 minutes, its never boring. And the musical score is great too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cut it out (heh, I pun!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's the deal: this movie's famous. Very famous. So famous, in fact, that it took me forever to get around to seeing it because I heard, read, and talked so much about it before seeing it that it felt like I had already seen it. So many clips abound in so many movies, so many seminars, and so many allusions in other media, that in a sense I had actually seen the whole thing, just not strung together in the way it's strung together, which is to say that I recognized all though it was a new experience. This movie is both over-rated and yet precisely rated so. It lives off of its own self-reflexivity the way its fame lives off itself. So let's get into it: "A bout de soufflé" is about a guy who starts out saying "I'm a bad person" though he uses a bit harsher term than that. This man Michel, who wants to be Humphrey Bogart but is only a two-bit petty criminal, ends up killing a cop to escape him and then runs to his lover, Patricia, in order to spend time with her and escape while a city-wide search for him goes out. The theme is the aspects of relationships and the new gender roles in a modern age. The form is highly experimental. The idea is the New Wave, a way of looking at cinema beyond the level of narrative construction to the new construction of a synthesis of sound, image, and editing.Now, not all the cuts in here are genius, and not all of them work. When regarding experimental cinema, always remember that just because it's experimental doesn't mean it works, and that's very true of this movie. Some scenes, like the interview with Patricia, are pure genius. Others, like cuts while people are getting in and out of cars, are pretty useless and serve nothing but to remind us that we're not watching a narratively-structured movie. Some cuts have something to say about the internal logic of the characters, others are just a means of getting from one end of the room to the other faster to save film stock on a tight budget. Some cuts create a real sense of desire to see a new logic on what is going on, others are simply distracting.This behemoth of a movie, however, will always be famous for the poetics it is whether you like it or not. Comparisons to MTV don't count--these jump cuts are way more jarring and sudden, and especially aren't mean to be hyper-kinetic to distract you from the fact that the music you're listening to is horrible. It's a great movie to watch as a student of film to learn how to think about film-making differently, but learning about film should never stop or resolve there--there are other craft techniques, different approaches to narration, stories to be told. An experiment is successful when it's built upon, not the apex. Build upon this. Appreciate it for its moment in time and the way it's disrupted our cinematic experiences, but move on as well.That is all.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A couple of facts for you: firstly, the original idea for the plot came from Francois Truffaut. Therefore, Breathless represents a synthesis of the talents of two great directors, which come together to create a near perfect film. Compare it with Truffaut's 'Tirez sur le pianiste', which deals with similar themes bit with much less style; the combination of Godard's stylistics with Truffaut's feel for plot is a winning combination.Secondly, the film represents Godard's (and Truffaut's) obsession with American popular culture, particularly the pulp gangster film. But this is also mediated through a European intellectual tradition that sees the director as auteur and is not afraid of the introduction of philosophical ideas into film. So you get both the homage to 'Bogey' himself (Humphrey Bogart) with art house trappings - a trick Godard also pulls off, almost as successfully, in 'Bande a Part', which uses a plot from a US crime novel. Godard's films never fall to the level of their influences, but incorporate and comment on them. In a word, the success of 'A Bout de Souffle' is synthesis of many different modes of film making and cultural traditions. If I was going to be really pretentious I'd talk about the Russian literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin here and his notion of heteroglossia, or the incorporation of different languages and voices into a single work. But I'll leave that for another day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen various other films from the French New Wave, including 400 Blow when I was 8 years old, I finally rented this film to see what started all.After seeing it, I could see why this film was so revolutionary. With its free form camera technique, intersecting jump cuts to signify motion, along continuing dialogue during those jump cuts. The whole technique gave the impression of the immediacy with the actors, bringing us to the scenes. It seems film making has come full circle with the Dogma 95 style, both being a counter-reaction to the style of film making of that time.The bedroom scene is unique, giving us a free form view of their interaction on their relationship. It is something only the French could give us, useless dialogue that is forwards the characters.The only weak part I could see is the way the story is told, since I am not a fan of old American films, I did not pick up on many of the movie's reference to other American films. The only ones are the obvious reference in the film. Obviously much was referred to various B-movies. I could not pick exactly where, but it made some parts of the story feel like one.</fullReview>

This film would likely get an "R" rating in the film board has its way, as Poiccard never let a cigarette go out without using it to light another one.The lovely and talented Jean Seberg just added to the film's magic and enjoyment.Watch this for a look at a master at work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breathless will stand the test of time, over-rated or not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw breathless I didn't not think much of it. I enjoyed it and thought nothing more. I wasn't blown away, or left "Breathless", but without a doubt something about the film stuck with me. After a couple a repeated viewings, and ventures into his other films, he has become one of my favorite directors. I can see the arguments in which people claim this film to be over-rated, but one can not go into the film without having an understanding of what they will experience. Breathless, or A Bout De Soufflé, is Jean-Luc Godard's premiere motion picture. Watching the film today still shows an impact of what it could hold on people interested in filmaking and its process. Scenes jump, the soundtrack can sometimes be abbrasive, with random moments of background sound overpowering the dialogue, and it is filmed on a very small budget. There are scenes that drag on where the characters simply talk in conversation on nothing that seems captivating for drama. It is just two people holding conversations. Godard films these normal things yet his form of editing and camera work create a very hypnotic viewing experience. he has this strange ability of pulling his audience into his film by using shots and editing more so that actual dialogue. Don't get me wrong, the film has a captivating story and involving plot, but if any other director were behind the character for most of the scenes it would have been torture to watch. The film is about a young man who steals a car and gets into trouble with the police. To pass the time and hide out he decides to spend his time with his American girlfriend. Their relationship and understanding of each other begin to bloom as the police inch closer and closer. It is not a Noir, and it is not a drama. It can only be described as a Godard film through and through. Every time I come back to this film i find something new. Some rule Godard broke in the unwritten rule book of film-making. All in all this is a love or hate experience, and one viewing will not do the film justice. If you like the film and want to see more, or gain a better understanding of his work, check out his other films. Alphaville, Pierrot Le Fou, Contempt, and Weekend are all worth checking out. Godard changed his view in each film he made yet kept them all uniquely his own. One can not look at current cinema without seeing the influences Godard created when he challenged the idea of what is acceptable in the process and delivery of 20th century motion pictures. if you're interested in Film-making, check it out. The flick is a gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The glamor of cool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I don't know if I'm unhappy because I'm not free, or if I'm not free because I'm unhappy." - PatriciaJean-Luc Godard's debut film, Breathless, became a cause celebre of the French New Wave in the early 60s. Dedicated to Monogram, the studio that churned out endless grade-B films in the ?40s, its raison d'etre seemed to be to work against everything that Hollywood stood for. Using jump cuts, hand-held camerawork, improvisational jazz, and natural settings, Breathless stood conventional cinema on its ear, and Godard instantly became the champion of radical, independent filmmaking. The style of the film, flashy with a nervously amoral edge, cleared the path for the directors of our day to employ avant-garde techniques to elevate movies about questionable characters into the realm of art. Breathless still feels revolutionary 42 years later but the question is -- does the preoccupation with style make us immune to the content?The film opens in Marseilles where charismatic thief, Michel Poiccard (Jean-Paul Belmondo) steals a car en route to Paris. When pursued by a cop, he finds a gun in the glove compartment and murders the policeman in the Cote d'Azur. In Paris, he steals money to court Patricia (Jean Seberg), an American who sells newspapers on the Champs-Elysees and take her to Rome. A French version of Bonnie and Clyde, they profess love, engage in banter about popular culture, tell lies, do their best to avoid intimacy, and ultimately betray each other. Both devious and self-serving, they are oblivious to the consequences of their actions, concerned only with immediate satisfaction. In the film's most discussed scene, Patricia and Michel talk extemporaneously for 23 minutes in bed while chain smoking cigarettes. Seberg quotes from Faulkner ("between grief and nothing, I will take grief") and hangs a poster of a Renoir painting. He professes his love for everything American, its culture, cars, movies, and women. None of this forwards the story in any way but allows us ample insight into the characters. I can't say if films like Breathless merely reflected the trend in society toward casual violence or helped to create it; however, I feel that subsequent films that glamorize criminals can at least partially trace their antecedents to Breathless. Godard has called Michel an "Anarchist hero". Does that mean that stealing cars and committing murder makes you a hero if you are charming enough and fancy yourself to be Bogart? I think part of the reason I found this film to be objectionable is that I could not identify with the characters and their lack of self-awareness. Yes, there is some sense of resignation at the end, but they do not appear to take responsibility for the questionable acts they performed. Both Belmondo and Seberg looked like they had fun making the film. I wish I could say the same for myself watching it.</fullReview>

It is quite fun, even there are not any more boys and girls talking so artfully like the protagonist (nor in France). It has got Bogart and black American cinema influence. But at the beginning of the sixties the dialogue and the action show here was breaking and provocative. Like the movie pretends to be. It was directed by J.L. Godard, written by F. Truffaut and play by Jean Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg. The own Godard makes a part as a police informer. Film-maker J.P. Melville plays another role. It was shot in Paris. It is famous but amusing.

Either the editing of my VHS film was horrible, or Godard's folks didn't know much about editing.What I DID like about it was the side-trips to such things as interviews with the director about women and love, the beautiful scenes of Paris and the really wierd interaction between Belmondo and Seberg. If it weren't for the fascinating disjunctive script, I would think that this was just a series of head shots of these 2 beautiful people.I would also like to know what Seberg's relationship with Godard was. You must see it so you can at least know what references mean in other film reviews. The guy's a no-noodnik, but he is VERY sexy with no sex scenes atall. Come to think of it, back then the actors HAD to project a lot of sexual chemistry or you wouldn't believe what was about to happen under the covers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A man steals a car in Marseilles and drives it to Paris. On his way, Michel is stopped for speeding and shoots a policeman.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Paris, he needs to collect some money from a friend and meet an American girl who he seems to like. One third of the movie is shot in Patricia's hotel room, while Michel tries to convince her to sleep with him and to run away with him to Italy. He convinces her of the former, but when the latter becomes a definite possibility, she turns him in to the police. Instead of running away, he decides to wait for the police and go to prison. However, when the police arrives, a friend of Michel's throws him a gun in a last attempt to save him. The police panics and shoots him. The film is shot in black and white with a hand held camera.There are four interrelated facts about Godard and his film that make a new historical outlook ideal. First, Godard was extremely aware of his medium's connection to other modes of expression, especially literature, philosophy and painting; and his style included a conscious attempt to demonstrate this interconnectedness. "The cinema is not a craft. It is an art . . . One is always alone on the set as before the blank page." Godard saw himself as an author and wanted to integrate his literary influences into his film. Furthermore, in wanting to break away from the rules of film making, he made his connection with literature as obvious as possible: Breathless is filled with direct quotes from authors like Faulkner, Dylan Thomas and Rainer Maria Rilke, among others. Probably the most striking feature of Breathless is its cinematographic style. The lives and thoughts of the characters are echoed by the camera movements and editing innovations Godard has made. Of these, the most important are the jump cut and the quick cut. Godard invented the technique of cutting out a few feet of film in seemingly random places. This "jump cut" produces a rhythmic, unsettling pulse in certain scenes. Michel is seen lying in Patricia's bed, and in the next he is walking out of the bathroom.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Breathless is the way the story line and the filming style come together to make a coherent philosophical statement. The primary question is, why is it that although Michel is an unambitious, untalented, immoral punk, the audience is able to ignore these traits and sympathize with him? The answer lies in the fact that everything Michel does is done with an extraordinary style. He is open, flamboyant, and cheerful and his actions, however meaningless or amoral, reflect this attitude. "You must never break," Michel says to the audience while driving his stolen car in the opening scenes of the film. In another scene, there is a poster which says, "live life dangerously to the end." This reminds one of Nietzsche's advice as given in the Gay Science, This style possessed by Michel would not be enough if Godard hadn't shown everyone else in the film as lacking even this. There are basically three types of people in the film: the masses, who are like apathetic, unaware zombies (for example, a man is hit by a car, and people hardly notice; Michel runs down the street after being shot, and hardly a head turns.); there is one attractive hard working character, and Michel takes advantage of her by stealing her money, and there are two serious and committed characters, the police, and they are made to look absolutely ridiculous.Godard shows us a world that is immoral, senseless and empty. Everything lacks a reason. "Why do you want to make love to me?" asks Patricia in the bedroom scene. "Because you're beautiful" "but I'm not beautiful" "OK, then because you're ugly" Michel is the only character who is able to recognize and take advantage of the situation by being amoral and uncommitted with passion and cheerfulness. He is sensitive to his environment. He likes the sun, he likes France, and he is depressed by ugly architecture. Of course he is egotistical, but according to the Nietzschean view of a meaningless world, this is a good thing. Michel takes advantage of the lack of dictated meaning to create his own meaning and "create poetry from nothingness." He invents his life and his past as he goes along. He claims that his grandfather drove a Rolls, he says he can only stay at the Claridge (a very expensive hotel), he says his father was a clarinetist, among other stories. Michel isn't caught up in the seriousness of searching for meaning. Furthermore, he is unafraid of the ultimate nothingness: death. The omnipresent end of life just makes his present actions more poignant and intense. And since all has equal seriousness, all is permitted! The next question is why is Michel so attracted to Patricia. She represents a negative version of himself. However, unlike Michel, she is unable to throw herself into the nothingness. She falls in love with him at the moment she learns he's a murderer, for only then does the impossibility of permanence become evident, and when the escape to Italy seems plausible, she turns him in to the police. Breathless is an attempt to show life as it is when one has repudiated a false morality and succeeded in living cheerfully without ultimate reason.Today, fortunately or not, we are less easily shocked by the message of present day films with similar immoral themes (Natural Born Killers and Pulp Fiction come to mind). Who knows, maybe Nietzsche was right. . .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>being a francophile AND very fond of french movies, as well as american movies; this was 1 "classic" i had not seen til now. i must say it was disappointing to say the very least. intellectually, it stuck me as a bad remake of an american 'b' movie. structually, it makes the very worst of the film noir movies of the 40's classics in comparison. i now understand the faux sophistication of the "artistes" who claim originality, but would not know "art" if they tripped over it. after seeing several godard &amp; truffaut movies, it seems they have played 1 heck of a joke on the world wide movie going public. IF this was considered advancement of the french movie industry, i now know why jerry lewis, sandals with socks, &amp; berets are thought of as "icons" of french culture!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Left me breathless with boredom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Critics often refer to Jean-Luc Godard as a `filmmaker' rather than a `director.' That may be true. A director would pay attention to matters of pacing, tone, and characterization when shooting a picture. Godard is too busy making `cinema' to do any of these mundane things. The result is this excruciatingly boring arthouse favorite, which has a reputation for being more influential than it really merits, unless those little jump cuts in the editing count. Back in the old revival house days, we usually attributed hops and skips like these to the worn out print the theater was showing. The middle 30 minutes or so are devoted to Seberg and Belmondo lolling about in a small hotel room mouthing vacuous, pseudo-intellectual banalities, which they seem to be saying more to themselves than to each other. (E.g., Seberg: `I don't know if I'm unhappy because I'm free, or if I'm not free because I'm unhappy.' Honey, if you don't know, I sure can't help you!) Seberg also participates in another time-wasting sequence: a press conference with smug-windbag real-life director Jean-Pierre Melville, who is given to such pronouncements as a desire `to become immortal, and then to die.' Belmondo plays a thoroughly obnoxious thug who likes to make faces in the mirror like Bogart. When he's not out robbing people or stealing their cars, he casually shoots a policeman who is pursuing him. You could care less when he's eventually killed, since Godard seems to be more interested in arcane references to old movies than in telling a story. He's dedicated `Breathless' to the old Monogram studios, which made ultra-low-budget quickies during the 30's and 40's. Sitting through one of them would be infinitely more entertaining than suffering through this overrated dud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Godard's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Godard saw that amateur films of family and friends had a poignant nostalgia and an immediacy that was lacking in American films. Even the great Hitchcock working in America at well-financed studios produces his masterpieces with great deliberation and finesse creating a plastic art. So Godard mixes improvisation, street scenes shot from within a box on a wheelchair and captures Parisians as they really are in their banality, in their recognizable humanity, and therefore, the thrill of humankind in recognition.The Belmondo character smokes his fat Chesterfields exactly like Bogart, his gangster screen mentor. So the director interjects his admiring eye on American film actors within the storyline. Belmondo impersonates Bogart, his many personal screen quirks, but then the stoic Bogey is exaggerated, a modern stalking horse for future punkdom. You could almost see the coming swinging 60's five years in advance as Belmondo and doll-like Jean Seberg prance about Paris, breaking the stodgy rules of their 1940's,1950's parents, making love on a whim, making banal, pseudo-intellectual references, outlandish statements ? I've had lovers, many, anyone I see, blahhh blah, I'm pregnant ? so what ? let's get under the sheets, banality under amazing visual setups in a plain room for thirty minutes. Then there's the cuts from moment to moment, a two or three minute cut to the same shot with the car driving through Paris ? a parade of diplomats ? a policeman on the trail of Belmondo interwoven, so we have the effect, especially in black and white, of a documentary spliced together by an amateur.These are all very original ideas, which I think along with One Life to Live make Godard a heavy weight in the pentathlon of great directors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not So Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film as part of my Film Studies coursework, and afterwards i had to come on here and write about it. I literally cannot believe the comments that i saw from other people. This film is appalling, shocking not even worth reading the title. I shall refrain from bad language, but i shall let you know that is what I'm thinking. The editing to start with is unbelievable, its jumpy, completely irregular and completely inhibits your viewing of the film. I know this film was made in the sixties but thats no excuse. Some great films were made in this time AND THIS FILM Definitely ISN'T ONE OF THEM. The acting is poor and the continuity is non existent. Not so good. lifeistricky</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I HATED this movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We watched this(and many others) for my film class, and I just have to say that I cannot figure out it's "greatness". The editing scheme is completely incoherent, at no time can you tell what's going on. The plot is muddled, the direction poor. I have a great amount of respect for French filmmakers...I loved "Au Revoir Les Enfants" by Louis Malle, and everything I've seen by Luc Besson (La Femme Nikita and The 5th Element), but I can only compare what I have seen of Godard's work to "Manos, Hands of Fate" and several other really bad films from MST3K. Maybe it's because a friend of mine told me before I saw it that it was brilliant, so I had high expectations.That aside, there is ONE thing I really liked about this movie, the main character is a huge fan of Bogart, who represents the Hollywood Godard departs from in all his films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two things are important in life: for men, women; for women, money.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the few films that I was actually very interested in listening to the audio commentary. I do not normally do this with films, because it may scar my overall feeling of the film by hearing how the director had gas throughout the production, so I stay clear. The director of this film, Jean-Luc Godard is considered the Godfather of the French "New Wave" movement. I had to see a film by this man. I had to see what a film made back in 1959 has brought to modern cinema. While I was impressed with the style in which this movie was filmed, I was not impressed by the actors in the film. This was one of those movies that I could have watched without the sound. While the director uses film techniques that are now the standard in Hollywood, the actors that participated in this film left more to be desired. I know that I have used that phrase several times in this review, but it is my general feeling of this film. I went in expecting WAY too much, and came out with the feeling of sand falling through my fingers.The shots of the actors talking to the camera, the quick camera shots, and the cryptic story are amazing to see, but you can sincerely tell that he was experimenting with this film. The actors talking into the camera you can tell are reading their lines, forcing French words out of their mouth, while trying to bring the audience into the picture, into the world that these two main characters are trying to create. Then there was the quick camera shots which made me feel as if Godard was having a heart attack instead of bring artwork to the silver screen. Finally, there was the cryptic story. So many times you find yourself trying to keep up with what these characters are doing, what they are talking about, or who they are interacting with. I felt that sometimes their interactions were too minimal, while others were too long and in-depth. This film WAS interesting to watch because you can see traces of Scorsese, Tarrantino, and even Stone in this film, and where these 21st century directors learned their techniques. I would bargain to say that without this film perhaps there wouldn't be any of these three directors making amazing movies today. BUT that still does not mean, by any means, that this was a great movie. I actually hated this movie. I hated the characters the most. I could live with the story ... I could live with the new film techniques being used, but I could not ... and should not ... have to live with the characters. The actor and actress that carried the main parts in this story were, to be honest, horrible actors. I could not get into any of them. In Michel's final scene, I was looking at my clock wondering how long Godard would leave the camera on him, or if it would just be over with so I could get to my next film. Patricia was unbelievable and confused. While this film is trying to build a love story, you instead get bombarded with philosophy and art instead of love. I think Godard was trying to build a love story using these elements, but it never happened. Therefore, when Michel's climactic scene arrives, we feel nothing for him. Perhaps this was what Godard wanted us to feel, but then it does not go with the rest of the film.Overall, I do not suggest watching this film. I have read other reviews that talk about how film students need to watch this film to fully respect the field, but I would have to say "I can't". I would give up on film if this was the best-of-the-best. Grade: * out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A totally boring film. I had to watch it for school, but nearly fell a sleep during. How nice that the director knows how to cut, but halfway through I thought I was going crazy. In the end you didn't know where the hell everyone was. And than the accent of the girl. Very annoying. And please make up your mind. Love him, don't love him, love him, on no I'll turn him in. And this movie has absolutely no storie whatsoever. It's just based on endless conversations about nothing. Oh, the music was alright.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the focus film during my Film Studies French New Wave project, and it is quite a good one. I only heard of it before that project when I saw clips of it on TV. This is actually one of the films that Quentin Tarantino got inspired to direct Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Anyway, it is basically a gangster film about other gangster films, with its own original story intertwined. It starts with Michel Poiccard alias Laszlo Kovacs (Jean-Paul Belmondo) admitting to himself and the film audience (as narrator) that he is an arsehole, and he certainly is. Besides the gangster element, it is mainly a troubled love story between him and American Patricia Franchini (BAFTA nominated Jean Seberg). I like the moments of speaking English instead of French and I can see why it is one of those must see films. It was number 8 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die. Very good!</fullReview>

Brilliant for many of the reasons Jean Luc Godard is seen as brilliant and idiotic because it makes precious little sense (whatever language it's viewed in). In fact I would suggest not getting it with english subtitles because that only makes it worse. following in his footsteps, "Jean" Luc Besson made the professional, which raised idiocy to new heights. I will leave you with one question:"what is going on in this movie?"Thank you!4/10</fullReview>
