		<fullReview>Richard Gere in a cheesy remake of a '60s French nouvelle vague classic? Sounds like it should really suck, right?Wrong. Turns out that Jim McBride's "Breathless" one of the best American films of the '80s. Electric performances, superb use of music, and direction with great zip and flair. The fact that this still gets so many negative reviews proves that, even now, most people simply don't get it. The main thing is Gere's performance - you'll either love his preening, irrepressible arrested adolescent, or find him grating. I think it's the performance of his career. This is one of Tarantino's favourite movies, and although it's not really anything like a QT movie, you can see why it appeals to him. I was all set to hate it, but by the end I loved it. Check it out, and decide for yourself.Oh, and not even LA in the height of summer is anything like as hot as Valerie Kaprisky.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got tired of watching my censored taped-from-TV version of this film, so I finally bought the DVD. I am one happy hombre. In addition to the superior video and audio quality, one gets several unobstructed views of the object of Gere's love/lust -- and that's no insignificant treat.One reviewer aptly referred to this film as Gere doing his "early-80s cheeseball riff on the sexiest man alive." I concur. "Breathless" could be seen as an expansion of his minor role as Diane Keaton's dangerous pretty-boy in "Looking for Mr. Goodbar" -- transposed from wintery Chicago to sultry L.A.I won't analyze this film. It doesn't hold up under criticism, and certainly there is plenty to dislike, starting with the relentlessly sociopathic behavior of its protagonist. Rather, in the spirit of the film's love-almost-conquers-all theme, here's just a partial list of what I love about "Breathless":1. Kaprisky in her see-through swimsuit. Rowrrrr! The rest of her wardrobe is pretty damn sexy, too. (The jury's still out on Gere's blue 'soot.')2. The kiss at the diving board. It has to be one of the best in cinema history. Kaprisky is a goner after that.3. Gere's line: "I think maybe I was rolling dice when I should have been rolling you." Cheesy, sure, but look at her face when he says it.4. The shower scene, together. Kaprisky running hot and cold. "Jesse, you're crazy." ... "So what?" ... "It's OK. I like it."5. Gere turning female heads wherever he goes, as he exudes his studly scent.6. Los Angeles as The Place to Be. I lived and loved in L.A. during the early/mid-80s, and can vouch for the intoxication of being young and on the go in the City of Dreams. It's one big-ass place. McBride and veteran lensman Richard Kline do a superb job of capturing its heat, light (L.A. sunsets put a glow over the whole city), and diversity -- from the downtown hotels and office towers, to the industrial sections, to the Hollywood hills, to upscale West L.A., to the beach communities (where we see what must be every mural in L.A.).7. The amazing ending. Gere taking his "all-or-nothing" motto to the wire. In what other movie will you see a dude dancing and singing to his woman while the cops have their guns drawn on him?"Breathless" is Gere at his best. Maybe Kaprisky, too, for whatever that's worth. Don't think too hard about it. Just enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pelvic Thrust of Zen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so the idea is to achieve emptiness so that we may be actually informed by what it is we see. To train an eye for details that doesn't react or classify or evaluate but instead grasps effortlessly the totality of what a film means to us. In this process, naturally we have to discard our preconceptions and routine streams of thought; who made the film, is it art-house, does it belong in a list of masterpieces.A bunch of those here; a remake of a well known French film, the presence of Richard Gere (usually signifying fluff), the very idea of a film that never made much sense to begin with. Who needs a Breathless remake, much less the Hollywood version? But we got it, so what about it? The Godard film was about young people coming to discover for the first time the struggle with important things, about love and meaning dealt with in the pretentious, silly, superficial ways of youth. What tied the struggle together was a boyhood fantasy about movies. We had a protagonist acting out an imaginary gangster part and the reality of the film arranged around him as a movie plot in which to act the part. It was about the safe distance provided by the fictional as conflated into the emotional distance between two people.Now watch how the remake transcribes this. Richard Gere is the Michel Poiccard character but instead of Bogart he is a Clark Gable. A movie hunk 'exhuding studly scent' as another reviewer aptly puts it. Recklessly oblivious to anything but the present moment and what it has to offer, he is the very dream of movies. A doofus at first sight but who instinctively seems to have grasped the essence of life by the balls. As much a target of ridicule as admiration. We see him empathize with utmost seriousness with Silver Surfer comics! Something akin to a destiny for him.But we're not inside him, we're siding with the French girl who's come to LA to study architecture. The girl who plans, thinks, wants the buildings she will create to last. The perfectly logical human being who (along with us) is swept away by the irresistible allure of an existence without bounds, centered in the 'now' and radiating outwards. Valerie Kapriskie is a perfect match here, an Ali McGraw to Steve McQueen; she's great because she can't act to hide what seems a genuine infatuation with Gere's adolescent antics (mixed with genuine frustration).We travel with them through a fetish dream of LA. Cars are fire-engine red Thunderbirds, summer dresses and even telephones pink. I've been going this month through a phase of cinematic vacation in Los Angeles, and this one has the best sense of place of anything I've seen yet. The dark joint with the jukebox, the empty streets blowing with hot summer wind.But it's more than a ride of pure, exhilarating movie pleasure, there's something to talk about here.It's peppered throughout, but centered in a scene by a pool. The girl wants to know what is behind the man's face, what kind of nothingness. He blurts something about love, no doubt cribbed from some magazine. A little later an aging architect, who no doubt has been where she is and has come to understand the world, tells her that nothing that is built lasts.And the best part, taken from the pages of a Silver Surfer comic. I won't go into details, but it says something about us, the sentient beings narrating our story, removed from our heart yet discovering it in every reflection. It makes for perfect Zen.So we have this hip-swivelling, rock'n'roll Zorba the Greek, who is empty inside in the best sense possible, so that he is filled with everything. Like only a blank sheet of paper can be clearly written on.And he's on the run for a fateful mistake of shooting a cop. How the scene is edited is important; we see a windshield shatter, then Gere looking with astonishment at the pistol in his hand. Elements crucially missing from the edit (the action itself) reveal the emotional state; how many mistakes can we look back on and be perplexed how we let them happen? There's more to it. There's a marvellous love scene in a movie theater playing Gun Crazy (which the film is reversed from). The two lovers roll around as behind them loom huge footage of the fictional couple in Gun Crazy discussing what pertains to the two lovers.And before the climax, we ride all the way up to a property overlooking the LA nightscape. Errol Flynn's as we find out, again movieland.It is better than the Godard film, miles better. It's as much about the old tropes of sex and violence as that film, except it's filled with actual heart. It is about kitsch elevated into noble gesture, about reality dismantled into fiction and the opposite. Novice film buffs discovering a sense of importance with Tarkovsky and Malick will find little in this simple film to appreciate; but those who've done their rounds and are looking for specific things may be strangely fulfilled by this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gere at his flamboyant best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Gere is quite simply the whole show in Breathless. To this day, this remains his most flamboyant performance of them all. He's immoral, yet charming and by sheer enthusiasm you can't help but root for this tragic character. The story seems to be a mere excuse to showcase Gere's charisma and sex appeal and he carries this movie as far as it can go. Although this is hardly groundbreaking stuff, director Jim McBride seems to be an ample filmmaker. The film is filled with nice location photography and some flashy angles here and there. I also dug the music score, shame there's no soundtrack album available anywhere. I recommend this film to anyone. Probably seen it over 20 times and I never get tired of it. Granted, I am a Richard Gere fan, but I also think this movie is truly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lurid fun and has aged well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 1983, the remake of Jean-Luc Godard's "A Bout de Soufflé" was savagely attacked by critics. It was understandable at the time. Today, I'll bet many of the critics probably feel the film is much better compared to today's bottom feeder cinema (many of which top the box office).Richard Gere's Jesse LuJack does the rare feat of being both repulsive and likable. Early in the film, you despise the reckless, cocky, S.O.B. of a criminal that he is but as the film wears on you suddenly find his character extremely appealing. Once you warm up with him, you realize how much fun Gere is having playing LuJack. His traipsing in L.A. becomes very entertaining in a video game sort of way. Singing to Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis, disrupting his girlfriend's exam, and his role as The Fugitive makes the film so compelling and fun to watch. He embodies coolness while being hip; which can be hard to do.As for Valerie Kapinsky, I have seen some of her soft-core films from Europe and she is tremendously sexy. She has sex appeal and looks delicious in virtually every scene. Her acting here gave her an undeserved rap. She's supposed to be playing a French exchange student. I think she did the best job possible by playing herself. I would take Kaprinsky over some American actress faking a French accent. There could have been other French actresses out there that could have taken the part but she fit in perfectly for the role IMO. She probably didn't object to the nudity required.The film also delivers some steamy situations. Making love in front of a huge screen showing an old movie (I think Judy Garland was in it) while being on the lam in L.A. just sounds so dreamy. Makes me want to do the same with my girl; only I won't have an arrest warrant on my head LOL! So yes, the movie isn't a classic and it isn't Casablanca but the film is much, much better than the turkey it received in 1983. It's definitely worth seeing.Interestingly enough, Jim McBride would later direct a biopic of Jerry Lee Lewis in 1988 called "Great Balls Of Fire" so his interest in late 50's rockabilly was apparent here regarding the great soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I really liked this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me Richard Gere carried the movie--he managed to make Jesse LuJak a character both repulsive and likeable. LuJak is a petty criminal, car-thief and then a murderer, not very bright (he reads comic books and seems to model himself on The Silver Surfer). LuJak moves in a world of cheap motels and seedy bars, and has a torrid and obviously doomed affair with an art student. But in the end he comes off as somehow admirable--we believe that he loves the Kapinsky character, that he might even be a good father to her child, given the chance. LuJak comes mighty near what I would call a tragic hero--flaws and all.As for the look of the movie, I find that equally well done--just for example, at one point the hero and heroine make love in torrid red lights, with a black-and white 30s movie in the background, also dealing with doomed lovers. The juxtaposed images were very nicely handled.Both thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good film which has been unfairly panned. The direction is excellent. Valerie Kapriskie does very well as Grere's love interest, and Grere himself, always willing to take an artistic risk, is superbly offbeat. The music is compelling and is used with genius, particulalry in the Santa Ana winds heat scene, where Kapriskie burns up the screen by simply slipping into a shoe. The chemistry between Kapriskie and Grere works. This should be a cult film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It ain't Godard, but it ain't anywhere near bad, either.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...you knew when it was announced that the cine-snobs would love to hate BREATHLESS. No, it wouldn't be Godard's A BOUT DE SOUFFLE, and it wouldn't have all the revolutionary touches of the 1960 original. While the director had made a cult favourite a dozen years before (the post-nuclear tale GLEN AND RANDA), and would go on to make THE BIG EASY and GREAT BALLS OF FIRE!, Jim McBride wasn't even a tenth as well known as Godard. But it did have Richard Gere, at the peak of his popularity, as the male star, and he gave perhaps the most entertaining performance of his career to date... ...the story is basically that of the Godard picture, but instead of a French guy pursuing an American gal in Paris, here we have an American guy pursuing a French gal in California. Jesse Lujack, a charming but larcenous hustler, steals a car from a casino parking lot in Vegas and high-tails it to L.A. to hook up with Monica, a French exchange student he'd spent the previous weekend with. But on the way, he unintentionally kills a highway patrolman. Will Jesse make it out of Los Angeles with Monica before the law can catch up with him?... ...for the exchange student, we have Valerie Kaprisky in her English-language debut. She was supposedly hand-picked for the role by Gere himself, and while she puts in a good performance, one still gets the feeling Gere and McBride may have brought the wrong Valerie to the set; the last time I watched the picture, I kept wondering how Valerie Quennessen (FRENCH POSTCARDS, SUMMER LOVERS) would have done in this part. Perhaps it is significant that Kaprisky, while having a successful film and television career in France and Italy, did not perform in another English-language movie until GLAM in 2001, eighteen years later...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the character Gere portrayed so flawlessly - Jesse's sheer intensity is a joy to behold. I really enjoyed the music throughout the film also, and the way it captures the varying moods so well. Kaprisky does a good job with her character as well - the exotic Frenchwoman Monica, torn between her plans for her life and her moth-to-the-flame attraction to the exuberant, unstoppable Jesse. This film has just had a run on EPIX on demand and I must have seen it six or seven times - it's one of my all-time favorites: those few, special films that, although I can almost speak the dialogue in unison with the characters, are still the ones I reach for and watch again and again.</fullReview>

I watch it and this started by love of Richard Gere. Richard plays a street punk Jesse, that shots a cop. Jesse flees to be with a Fench lady hes in love with. Jesse breaks into Monica's flat and showers the part of this movie he shows his penis.!!! Breathless shows the hardship a street punk, thats madly in love with a normal French lady that has goals in life. After they have sex, Monica turns away and she knows she messing with her good life for a street punk."Jesse I don't know what you want from me. I love you but I don't want to love you, you don't fit into my plans in my life". Monica is torn from her job and wasteing it with Jesse.If you haven't seen Breathless I won't say more,even not likening Richard Gere. Watch Breathless this underrated movie. I do cry at the end evey bloody time. I am now 30, I would say I have seen Breathless 20 or 30 times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's funny to see Richard Gere now, so refined and soft spoken and remember he played the quintesential wild man in "Breatless". I remember when I saw this, I was so young but it blew me away. This isn't a movie that's especially strong no depth nor is it the most original movie-cmon hot bad by, hot bad girl on the run together etc etc. Not original in the slightest but the movie was wholly absorbing. It just worked.I think this movie was completely decadent and was also a bit ahead of it's time-were it to be released now people wouldn't bat an eye but back then I remember it was pretty raunchy-I didn't know till I read some other reviews on here that Quenten Tarentino was a fan of this movie and there IS something about this movie that's a bit-I don't know-let's just say that I could see him making this. I think the appeal of this movie was on alot of levels, it was decadent, controversial, featured two leads who even by HOLLYWOOD standards were absolutely incredible looking,besides being fastpaced, action oriented and featuring plenty of sizzling scenes between the two leads. Although this is far from my favorite movie it sure did leave me breathless!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent if somewhat artistic movie typical of the 60's era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Breathless is an artistic movie that could have been, and probably should have been, created in the 60's. It likely would not have been panned then, as it was in 1983. The theme is liberal by today's standards. One has the temptation to stop viewing as early as a fifth of the way through the movie. That is a mistake. Like a play, it develops the characters slowly. Sit back and enjoy, the movie will develop in its own good time.The genre should be romance. Nothing else really fits. Screenplay and writing are French, which explains this movie. It definitely has a French flavor throughout, which is another reason it was probably panned. Richard Gere gives a stunning performance and well worth watching for him alone. Valérie Kaprisky is the excellent co-star, and makes the movie work. She has the center role of the picture. Together the two make it a memorable movie. I wish she would do more American films. Her talent is to make her character come alive through her "presence," on the screen, not so much the dialogue, which is mere accompaniment. Both deserve five starts for their synergy together.</fullReview>

Sadly, McBride was 10 years ahead of his time, and consequently his movie has been misunderstood for years, and slaughtered the both critics and audience.

Kerouak and Salinger in USA, Sartres and Camus in France, were among the intellectuals who inspired this generation.A generation whose "malaise" is embedded in Paris atmosphere. Paris which was the very center of occidental culture by that time.The American version of this story, Breathless, directed by Jim McBride, missed the point because the portrait of a generation of the sixties in Paris, cannot be transplanted to a context of the eighties in California.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't miss this one, if you can rent or buy it. Many have panned it, but in fact it's a marvelous film. Sure it looks in a way like a "grade b" film, as someone remarked: BUT is supposed to look that way. Richard Gere plays a grade B or C character, a Las Vegas hustler who flees to California to try to see his girlfriend / architectural student, the lovely Valerie Kaprisky. On the way Gere by way of what might be an accident, one of those incidents between deliberation and accident, kills a police office. He tries during the film to maintain his brash, hip cheaply charming persona in his wooing of Karpisky. This is an American classic, albeit a cult one. The critics panned Kaprisky, who was actually very good. It's one of those flicks which indicates that some critics should get another job. Trust me, this is worth seeing. The musical score, by the way, understated and superb. Gere is a genius. I can't think of any other actor who could have pulled this one off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it was some time in the late 80's when films started to become predictable. This version of Breathless in 1983 had a couple thing going for it - Richard Gere as he rose to fame and that is was a remake of a classic film. The writer of this film took some really big chances. We're suppose to root for a cop killer, street thug and womanizer? Yup and we do because the film works. It's not preaching morality like all films seem to do, it takes risks. My favorite seen of the film is towards the end where they go to underground dance party and end up in the loft of a movie theatre playing the classic 1940's film noir. The ending is a classic to - it's all or nothing with this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Richard Gere in all his glory!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie brought me back to my 80's L.A. I loved the sights, sounds, colors, the neon, the crummy neighborhoods and especially the soundtrack. The soundtrack (which I have tried desperately to find) and cinematic shots of Los Angeles alone make this film worth a watch. Despite its aforementioned drawbacks, it possesses a lush decadence that's quite entertaining. A most bizarre and exciting love story with a bitter twist that will break your heart. Gere is at his best with his character, and the way in which he understand his comic hero the silver surfer is almost uncanny, and the love he has is one in which we all desire with his co-star a beautiful french girl. Valerie Kaprisky operates at much the same level: she too looks good naked.. She's beautiful, but has next to no acting talent. It is not a polarising moment in cinema history but, if you can forget the film's origins and hope only for an entertaining movie, it will not let you down. Overall rating: 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out of Breath in America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An American car thief tries to convince a French college student to accompany him across the border into Mexico in this US remake of Jean-Luc Godard's '? Bout de Soufflé'. Better than the average remake out there, 'Breathless' certainly tries to do something different with the material. The setting and the nationalities of the two protagonists have been reversed; writer-director Jim McBride also drops much of Godard's original philosophical dialogue (give or take a comment about women's toes and seeing what lies beneath someone's face) in favour of comic book hero philosophising. The freeze frame ending here also makes for a solid changed ending. And yet, despite Richard Gere's constant singing of Jerry Lee Lewis tunes, his obsession with checkered pants and love of comic books, there is a less a sense of Gere living an elaborate fantasy existence by comparison to Belmondo in the original film. The 1983 'Breathless' is a little too grounded in grit and realism (take for instance a fight scene at a mechanic's scrap yard) despite all the bright coloured lighting early on promising something less down-to-earth. The performances are not as strong in the remake either, however, the film offers a more solid foundation for the big decision that the female protagonist makes towards the end. Truth be told, the film is arguably better paced than the Godard venture too with more sense of urgency and imminent danger if Gere does not get out of town, but whether this is a superior rendition overall (as some out there claim), that is a much harder case to argue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A guy called Tarantino was watching .....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Mcbride receives a letter from some guy named Quentin Tarantino in 1984. This is what it says.Hey Jim, whats up dude? Breathless was the real deal. I mean, I am a fan of Goddard. Big fan actually. But you nailed it with Breathless. This is what every film ought to be like. I loved all the comic book references. I mean you had a scene where Richard Gere reads out of "The Silver Surfer". Oh my god, I nearly exploded during that scene. What a great idea that was. I'm writing a script based on the Silver Surfer comic book. I am sure the f!ockers will reject me man.And I loved the rock n roll and surfer music soundtrack. How cool was that. Though there are better surf music bands out there than the ones you played in your movie. I have an idea for a movie that would have a lot of surf music.Valerie Kaprisky is kind of a bad actress. And Jim, I am afraid I do not agree with all the nudity. I disagree with the objectification of women even though I am fine with scenes where their arms get chopped off an blood spurts out like a shower. HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I wouldn't really have cast Richard Gere. I mean he did a great job. But Travolta would have been better. He is just a better dancer. And a lot more cooler. But I'm so glad you didn't cast him because I have an idea for another movie where I'll have Travolta dancing. And that's going to be cooler than the dance scenes in your movie. HAHAHAHHAHHAA! The film did have some pacing issues. But there was so much cool stuff in it. Anyway, just watch out for me, Jim. I plan to make my first movie before I am 26. And I will rip off from your movie. And you know what? My movie is going to be cooler than yours. HAHHHAHAHAHAHA! Quentin.(6/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some erotic camp fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jesse Lujack (Richard Gere) is a reckless uncontrollable petty criminal and a fan of the Silver Surfer and Jerry Lee Lewis. He steals a car in Las Vegas to go track down French college student Monica Poiccard (Valérie Kaprisky) is L.A. after spending a few wild nights together. His restless driving attracts a highway patrolman. Jesse shots him and the cops are after him. Monica is seduced by wild bad boy Jesse over Paul the professor. Ultimately their relationship is doomed.There is something campy and fun about this rendition. It's Richarad Gere's crazy wardrobe. It's the old fashion rear projection driving scenes. It's Kaprisky's flat French accent. It's the music. It's all the Silver Surfer philosophizing. I do feel like director Jim McBride could have committed more fully. This could be great surreal fun. It's partly cheesy, a lot of erotica and some smile-worthy fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most under-rated and cool films of the 1980's. Richard Gere is phenomenal as Jesse, a petty criminal living in fantasy land, a young man obsessed with the Silver Surfer and dreaming of Mexico- not to mention he's head-over-heels in love with a French beauty named Monica who's played by Valerie Kaprisky. Their love/hate relationship brings out the best and worst in them both, propelling the couple down unexpected paths with dramatic results. There seemed to be some off-screen chemistry going on too, because Richard and Valerie are magnetic on the screen. I'll leave the rest up to you. 10/10 Director Jim McBride and Cinematographer Richard H. Kline bring out an explosive aesthetic which will resonate and explode in the 1990's with films like True Romance and Pulp Fiction. A marker of what's to come, I recommend this film to those who love comic books, rockabilly, petty crime, eccentric characters, and romantic tragedies. Check it out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so bad in retrospect (holds up better than what one would think...)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when this film was first released. There was much hype since it was an American remake of a fairly renown French film from the 60s. At that point in Richard Gere's career he had portrayed several youthful virile characters (I guess you can say "studs" -- in "Looking for Mr. Goodbar" and "American Gigolo" and "An Officer and a Gentleman"). I think the critics and much of the public at the time saw this film as just another stud role of his. Maybe this is why the film was panned. I myself don't fondly remember it from the first time I saw it -- somehow it seemed empty and vacuous.I've just now seen this again after many years and Gere's off and on channeling of Jerry Lee Lewis is not something I saw the first time. I agree with another commenter here that Gere actually plays this role of a small time devil-may-care hood to the hilt. He captures the James Dean &amp; Marlon Brando rebel swagger, however minus their brooding or introspection. One endearing aspect of his character here is he's also something of a romantic and I think this is why the young French college student becomes enamored him. I rated this film a "7" and I think it's worth watching. It is also fairly provocative sexually (hot) and this aspect is tastefully depicted.After watching this I thought of the song from the late 1970s "Point of No Return," and Gere's character is heading down a very risky path. I don't think anyone affiliated with the making of this film was necessarily searching for a moral to the story -- I guess from the perspective of being older and seeing this now this is what was brought to mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seen this on our local THIS channel, which has been showing some really great lost movies that are no where to be found on DVD. Since it was a censored version I missed some of the nude and sex scenes, but since I never saw the original it was fine. I started watching it and for the sure the Tarantino stolen/borrowed shots, scenes, backgrounds were very noticeable to me. Valrie is def a stunner. I see a lot of people bashing her performance. But, really she is playing a French exchange student that I would assume is in her early 20's. So, with that in mind I think she played the part well. Gere did a really good job in this. I like this Gere much better than the older Gere in that he took chances, he didn't play "Richard Gere" back then. This and American Gigolo are really cool, take a chance roles, that he stayed away from later on in his career. Too bad. Anyway a nice movie on a free TV station I would never have seen otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept behind both Jim McBride movies, this and "The Big Easy" are to take a routine-at-best story and include one good sex scene. But, that's it! And, it's an amazingly unnecessary remake of Goddard's original.*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***The story is completely pointless, because you know exactly what's going to happen. Right at the beginning, Richard Gere kills a police officer. Gere's character is amazingly stupid throughout the whole film. So, we know he's going to get caught or killed at the end.His "getaway" attempt isn't even a getaway attempt! After killing the officer outside of Vegas, he goes to Los Angeles. Everyone knows that's where he's headed since that direction is where the shooting happened. But, he goes anyway so he can meet his girl. Smart! And then, he stays there for the rest of the film, basically waiting for the police to get him.Man, he's an idiot! And, he's completely shiftless, just bumming around the whole time. So, there's nothing remotely likable or relatable about him. And the girlfriend is one-dimensional, so who cares! Other bad features include a hilariously bad rear-projection screen trying to mimic the road going by. It's at least as bad as the similar sequence from "Airplane!"**** (4 Out of 10 Stars)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Gere flick that will leave you in a state of breathlessness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people I know, disfavored this movie. Only recently I got another bad vote from someone about it. I was so hanging out to see this movie when I was 13. I loved it again and again and again. It's Gere's hyper kinetic energy of a performance that makes it work. He's a car thief, who at the start, departs Vegas, heading to L.A via some ill fortune that sees him accidentally kill a cop. How his gun went off, completely taking out the windscreen, before taking out the cop, I couldn't figure. Jerry Lee Lewis fan that Jessie (Gere) he also a Silver Surfer comic fan, one scene having him and a teen argue over the Silver's Surfer's character I found surreal, but totally unrealistic. Gere's going to L.A to see his one true love, Monica, Valerie Kaprisky, who thank god has her looks working for her here. He's fixated on her. Angry at his intrusion, especially on the campus, a scene I loved, she becomes confused, her future plans. turned upside by this hunk, where finally she has to choose. Breathless is shot in loud color which would of looked great on the cinema screen. The pool scene, especially was a well shot scene. And when the authorities move in, Gere narrowly missing them at a bank when visiting an acquaintance, the drama and action become more pumped up, more serious, with Kaprisky running away with Gere, where inevitably in it's classic of classic ending, Gere's fate is only as we could of imagined. There are many classic moments in Breathless, and it is funny in a few areas, thanks to our lead, but you can take this movie for what it is, popcorn entertainment, and those ill favored critics, this is one flick I favor highly, no matter how many times I watch it. Gere's exploits will leave you breathless as well as bloody exhausted. He really is too much, in a movie you just can't get enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's just a panic attack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the time "Breathless" was released in 1983, a critic claimed that Richard Gere's deliberate overacting supported the stylised fantasy elements of the movie. Really? I suspect that he was simply surprised by the self-indulgence of the performance, especially when compared with films such as "Days of Heaven", "An Officer and a Gentleman" and even "American Gigolo" ? all made before "Breathless"."Breathless" was a remake of Jean Luc Godard's "A Bout De Soufflé" The success of that movie had a lot to do with timing, and forces that were working through society at the beginning of the 1960's. Godard's movie launched French Cinema's influential new wave, which also had an impact on Hollywood.The remake came 20 years later, and unlike Godard's version was no longer timely nor an antidote to the predictability of contemporary film.Richard Gere's character, Jesse Lujack, a petty hustler and car thief, accidentally kills a policeman and goes on the run with his French girlfriend Monica, played by Valérie Kaprisky. Unaware of Jesse's criminal activity, she is attracted to his wildness and the aura of danger he projects.Jesse Lujack as rendered by Gere is arrogant, self-centred, stupid and narcissistic; he has few redeeming traits. Whether it's gyrating to Jerry Lee Lewis while he drives yet another hot-wired automobile or practicing his quick draw with the remote while changing TV channels, extra bits of business are thrown into just about every scene.Although the film has strong production values, there are lapses in logic that are so silly they would probably get laughs if they had been in "The Naked Gun". Near the end, Jesse runs through the streets with his shirt unbuttoned to the navel, clearly revealing the distinctive tattoo on his breast that is the key feature of the police description that has just been broadcast. His checked pants don't help him melt into the crowd all that well either.In "White Heat", James Cagney created a memorable finale, surrounded by police on top of a burning fuel tank. In "Breathless", Richard Gere goes him one better when he disco dances ? in those checked pants no less ? as police close in from all sides. It is so over-the-top that it almost defies description.Valérie Kaprisky had to work hard to be noticed in this movie. That she does is because of the contrast between her low-key delivery and Gere's attention seeking hyperactivity.It appears that Richard Gere's performance in "Breathless" was a one off. From then on, if there was a trait that typified a Richard Gere performance, surely it was restraint. Look at him in films as diverse as, "Pretty Woman", "Internal Affairs", and "Shall We Dance?" Not only is he controlled but he also underplays to great effect. Maybe with "Breathless" he just needed to get something out of his system.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is nothing in this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started to watch this movie open-minded, without any expectations, not even knowing it scored a very modest 5.5 on IMDb.The movie proved to be utter disappointment for me. I like Gere, and I think he gave a reasonable performance, but there was simply nothing to the story which could touch me, or motivate me to watch through. He steals cars, reads comic books (Silver Surfer), he is in love with an art student, and longs to go to Mexico. Even if Silver Surfer or the the main character's wish to reach Mexico have hidden meaning, the symbols are rather lame.I have the impression the movie is built only on popularity Gere enjoyed in early eighties. His role in American Gigolo made him the sex symbol of the era, presumably rightly so, but you can not make a movie only from it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film many years ago but had pretty much forgotten about it until film critic Mark Kermode; who usually dislikes English language remakes of foreign films, selected it to launch his on line film club and stated that he thought it improved on the original. I have yet to see the original but on the strength of the recommendation I decided to watch this again.The story follows Jesse Lujack from the time he steals a Porsche in Las Vegas with the intention of driving to Los Angeles. Things start to go wrong for him when he finds a gun in the car's glove compartment then crashes after being pulled over by the police. He picks up the gun and accidentally fires leaving the cop mortally wounded. Somehow he gets to LA and goes to see a contact to get his money; he is only given a cheque though; he will have to hang around in LA for a couple of days to get cash. He then meets up with Monica, a French student, who he had a brief fling with when she visited Vegas. The rest of the film is spent with him trying to get his hands on some money, trying to persuade Monica to come with him to Mexico and avoiding getting arrested for the killing of the Highway Patrol officer.Richard Gere does a fine job as Jesse; a small time criminal with a passion for the comic book character The Silver Surfer and the music of Jerry Lee Lewis; both of which feature heavily in the film. The character is essentially immature and self-centred but Gere manages to make him likable which is needed if we are to believe that Monica would consider giving up a potentially successful career as an architect to go to Mexico with Jesse. Valérie Kaprisky is charming as Monica although at times I was uncertain whether she was being a bit wooden or doing a good job playing a character who was conversing in her second language; either way she looked lovely; I can see why Jesse wanted her to come with him when he fled to Mexico.Director Jim McBride did a great job bringing the story to the screen; I loved the slightly unreal comic book look to the colours in some scenes and the obvious back projection in many of the driving scenes. The story was fun to watch with some tense moments as well as a couple of genuinely hilarious scenes... the moment where Jesse interrupted Monica's exam was priceless as was the time the door fell of the shower as the two of them had sex inside.I was surprised to find that this film had been reclassified '15' by the BBFC; and even more surprised to learn that it is now uncut whereas the original '18' certificate had almost half a minute trimmed from it! If you have the '18' version you are only missing out on seeing Jesse hotwire a car and breaking into Monica's apartment.Now I just have to watch 'A Bout de Soufflé' to find out which is really the better film!</fullReview>

Gere walks away from this film having no doubt given his finest effort. I have tried for years to find the title to a piece of music used in the film. I believe it is used only twice. Once during the pool scene and once at the conclusion. It is a short clip which contains a wailing sax, it may have a Latin texture. Very fitting piece, very emotional. If anyone knows the title please share it with me. It is not a surprise how this film has kept it's following, it is timeless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having watched the original, "A Bout de Soufflé", in my French film class, and then "Breathless" a week later, I was easily able to pick my favorite. While considered to be stylistically and aesthetically pivotal, Godard's film literally put me to sleep-- and I never fall asleep while watching new movies. McBride's "interpretation" was fantastic. Because it's about 20 years newer (and now 20 years old), I felt that I was able to jibe with it- its modernity was simpler for me to follow. The soundtrack was totally amazing- I believe there's some Heart and The Pretenders at some important scenes, which was definitely a selling point ;) I totally recommend "Breathless" and unlike my professor, I don't really think you have to watch "A Bout de Soufflé" first.</fullReview>

This movie actually got me hooked on old Silver Surfer comics; which are corny and ham-fisted, but fun because they're 'played straight'. Like this movie.And Breathless still has one of my all-time favourite movie endings--Hollywood, Indie, or other. Don't compare it to the original French New-wave film. It has almost nothing to do with it. And, while I like the original, I love the cheesy appeal of the remake so much more.

		<shortDescription>An Underrated American Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a remake of a French film, sure. But watch this film and you will have insight and understanding of the American male pathos and the American male soul. Richard Gere plays Jesse Lujack, a petty criminal and wanderer, who becomes caught up in a harsh set of circumstances that leave him running from the authorities. Jesse is the type of guy who is always in search of excitement or action because that is who he is; he is your typical handsome, good natured male, transplanted in the American underbelly. And because of this, tragedy is never far behind.On the run, Jesse meets up with Monica, a beautiful, French exchange student, played by the lovely Valerie Kaprisky, whom we might assume has met in some bar or shopping mall. Jesse and Monica are both beautiful people, so we understand how they probably met: vis a vis - the natural way: through physical attraction. There is a problem, however. Jesse is from a different world than Monica. She is a college student who appears to come from money and privilege, and appears to be more comfortable with stability and therefore is respected in society. While Jesse is, well, the other kind.This movie is brilliant. One of the gems from the 80's. It has a wonderful pace, thanks to director Jim McBride. The music is fantastic; various pop songs and surfer jams are placed throughout. The writing by Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut is excellent because it is very accurate to how real people communicate; this is true with not only the lead actors but with the small roles as well. Yet, when it's all said and done, this is Richard Gere's movie. He is an absolute tour de force. He embodies Jesse; he knows how he thinks, how he acts and how he moves. It is quite the achievement. Arguably the best of Gere's career. There are many sequences that highlight the film. My personal favorite is the scene in the pool between the two leads. Gere and Kaprisky are young, in their prime, and playing off each other; attracted, repelled, and attracted again. There are reasons for this and I will not elaborate... you have to see it. It's a brilliant scene. Just see this movie. You will not be disappointed. 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****SPOILERS*** Re-make of the 1959 French Film Nior classic "A Bout De Soufflé" the US version "Breathless" has actor Richard Gere as the on the run "Checkered Pants Man", it's the only pair he has in the film, Jesse Lujack who's on the run from the police after accidentally killing a cop who stopped him for speeding on a Las Vegas highway. Jesse ends up hooking, no pun intended, up with this cute French chick Monica Poiccard, Valerie Kaprisky, while being on the lamb. It's Monica that he had a one night strand with the night before after meeting her in a Veges casino. Jesse, a master car thief, now plans to steal a hopped up car and drive with Monica to Mexico where, that's what he thinks, the long arm of the law can't get to him. Did the guy ever hear of extradition treaties between countries?Monica a French exchange student at UCLA has no idea that her new found boyfriend is wanted by the police for murder and goes along with him just for the sheer thrill of it. By the time that she does find out what it's or Jesse is all about she's torn between turning him, who by then she's madly in love with, into the police or joining him as a fugitive from justice on his mad dash towards the Mexcan/US border. It's a terrible decision on Monica's part but it's Jesse who ends up making it for her at the end of the film.French actress Valerie Kaprisky was toted to be the next Bridget Bardot and this was to be her breakout movie but you can see that she was way over her head in here. Not in the acting department but in being paired with her co-star Richard Gere. Gere didn't seem to have a script to work with in the film and most of his dialog seemed to be ad libbed. This had Gere doing what seemed like, in his unintelligent mumbling,a Marlon Brando imitation which was hard to figure out what he was saying throughout most of the movie.Miss. Kaprisky, as Monica, who did speak with a sexy French accent in understandable sentences seemed to have trouble interacting with Gere not quite knowing what he was talking about. But as for the sex scenes between the two they were both first class as well as X-rated! It took almost forever for Monica to find out what her boyfriend did, killed a cop, and when she did she started to have second thoughts in her checking out of the country with him. Even though she was made pregnant by Jesse in what had the be the fastest human pregnancy, about 24 hours, in all of recorded medical history! It turned out that "Breathless" not only bombed out at the box office but turned out to be the both first and last movie that Valerie Kaprisky ever starred in going back to her native France and continuing her film career there. And as it turned out no amount of money or, in co-staring in films with her, top Hollywood leading men would make her ever change her mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memorable for Geres' flamboyance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Jim McBride does manage to create a fairly amusing film based on the classic, highly regarded French film that inspired him to become a director in the first place - Jean-Luc Godards' "Breathless".The story set up is basically the same, as Richard Gere, in one of his most electric film performances, plays Jesse Lujack, an arrogant, authority defying punk, who in his attempt to get to L.A. quickly from Las Vegas, steals a car and accidentally shoots a cop (who later dies). However, this film has more to do with his energetic pursuit of the love of his life, French student Monica Poiccard (Valerie Kaprisky), than anything else.Incidentally, one can see how Geres' performance may affect ones' feelings about the film. It is an acquired taste, as is the character of Jesse, who's a big fan of Jerry Lee Lewis music and Silver Surfer comics. You also wish he'd shut the hell up about going to Mexico. But there's no denying the actors' conviction in playing this person. The stunning 19 year old Kaprisky remains a prime visual attraction, and both she and Gere do get nude for the film.McBride does give the film a decent amount of flash, and populates the story (he co-wrote the screenplay with L.M. Kit Carson) with striking faces and striking characters. A rich cast includes such people as John P. Ryan, as a hard driving detective, film director and designer Eugene Lourie as an architect, playwright Miguel Pinero as Carlito, James Hong as a grocer, Waldemar Kalinowski, also a production designer (and occasional actor), and Art Metrano as a criminal lowlife. The city of L.A. becomes a character in its own right, with much of the film shot on location rather than on any sort of set.The soundtrack is eclectic, with the expected usage of Jerry Lee tunes and a rocking end credits cover by X.This won't be for everybody, and it does admittedly go on longer than it should. It's at its best when it focuses on Monica; Kaprisky is definitely a grounding force for the story. Kaprisky remains compulsively watchable throughout.All in all, this is engaging in spurts, and it has enough style, sex appeal, and humour to make it a decent viewing experience.Six out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't particularly like L.A., I don't particularly like Gere I consider to be a single-role-abled actor, I don't like remake films generally, especially American french-originated ones, but I like this film.First of all, Gere is for sure in one of his best performances. The story is a little insignificant but this is where Gere performs : perfectly embodying his foolish character he actually gives all its credibility to the film. Kaprisky supports well her co-actor and renders well evolving emotions she feels for her lover starting with amusement evolving in feelings ending in impossible-love. Maybe Kaprisky is less astonishing nonetheless undoubtedly the two actors respond well together and we really understand their yet complicated relation.But above all, I like the directoring. Because of the freshness of it. For example the scene involving Gere and Kaprisky feeling the wind blowing through the heat of the city. Or the scene at the university in which Gere is trying to persuade Kaprisky to follow him in which he seems really human by being a little too sticky. Or the excellent last scene, leaving the spectator imagining the ending.Also L.A. is well photographed, obviously, and the general atmosphere of the city is well rendered. The numerous shuffled places show the variety of it. And the way the camera is handled makes you feel you actually live the city.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coming into this movie late was my mistake. It was on television, and only started to watch during Jesse's drive/escape to LA. After that, I wasn't sure what kinda of freaky movie I had stumbled upon! Obsessed stalker, psycho killer, or what? I couldn't get a handle on the movie for a good 30 minutes. The time setting and music choice caught my eye, and I continued to watch, merely for the fact that if I stopped I would be annoyed at not knowing what I had been watching. I guessed the title right, though that really was pretty apparent with the song being repeated numerous times, and I knew Monica would call the cops on him (but thats what I would do, too). I did enjoy the second half, piecing together what I missed from the developing story. Now that I have seen this is one of Tarantino's favorite films, it makes a lot more sense to me. I'm going to give it another chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On the run...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a 1983 Richard Gere film. Until I saw this film I was never in awe of Richard Gere. Whenever I used to hear people saying Richard Gere is their favorite star, I used give a blank look at them. But after watching this movie, I did understand why he is what he is? His flamboyant acting is simply unbeatably. Richard Gere is a car thief who has killed a police man accidentally while trying to escape. He keeps hiding from the police with a french student who was once with him in Las Vegas. But she is not sure of what she wants. To stay with him &amp; run throughout the life or settle down with some nice guy.The movie has got nice cinematography &amp; musics. One of the nicest stories down then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally Rockin' Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen the original, and this one is 1000% better. This movie has no shame and no boundaries. You simply won't see no-holds-barred love (and sex) scenes like these in a mainstream movie anymore. It's wall-to-wall fun and excitement and an awesome date movie. It brought me back to the 80's L.A of my wasted youth. I loved the sights, sounds, colors, the neon, the crummy neighborhoods, the classic cars (somehow, Jesse always manages to find some one-of-a-kind classic to steal whenever he needs a ride) and the junk man's pinwheel hat! Richard Gere has never been more exciting, before, and definitely not since (since he became Saint Richard). Here, he's expanding on his hustler character in Looking for Mr Goodbar. Where are the great exploitation movies? Fun, stupid movies have become a dying art, ever since the end of the Roger Corman era. Nothing made today approaches this kind of fun and insanity. No one in today's conservative Hollywood would have the guts to produce something like this. Just because this film isn't heavy or meaningful, doesn't mean it isn't totally awesome! And the Rockin' soundtrack is worth having all by itself: Jerry Lee Lewis, The Pretenders, X and 50s and 80s classics you won't hear anywhere else (I was amazed to hear Link Wray's "Jack the Ripper", a cult classic instrumental). I saw it when it came out, and then again recently, twice. The one and only criticism I have is Valerie Kaprisky. As an actress, she makes a wonderful model. She's beautiful, but has next to no acting talent. She delivers her lines in a monotone. Too bad there was no Eva Mendes or Sophia Vergara at the time. Still a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Valerie Kaprisky was not trying to win an Academy Award with her performance in Breathless. She did what she did best, showing herself as some of the best eye candy I have ever seen. Like a French model / actress, she did her job perfect as a quiet, sexy, and somewhat mysterious women.Deep down, that's what makes her character sexy, it's her moments of innocence with a touch of sex that makes you want to lick your lips from anticipation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A guilty pleasure!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Critics dismissed this film upon release and unfairly compared it to the classic original. The basic plot line is the same: A car thief (Richard Gere) who has just murdered a cop, hides out with a lovely french student (Valerie Kaprisky) who had previously left him in Los Vegas. They (surprise) fall in love again, but she's not sure if she wants to disrupt her life and go out on the lamb with him.This film is a definite guilty pleasure! Though fans of the original won't like it, it's actually not half bad. Gere's energetic performance is really something to see. The film's major flaw is the horrible performance by Kaprisky, who sounds like she's reading her lines off cue cards. But no matter, guilty pleasure seekers are sure to enjoy the beautiful stars (with Gere and Kaprisky both looking great in or out of costume) and the cheesy story line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... Even if you only like it because you find it amusing to mock how achingly cool it thinks it is. Okay, a large part of me having such a soft spot for the film is that I haven't yet seen Godard's original on which it was based; but I do know enough about cinema to know that that film is the real thing and this is merely the young upstart who thinks it does everything bigger and better, but actually keeps its brains in its trousers... Hey, you know what? That's actually a pretty good analysis of the movie! It has a real macho/homo-erotic tone; but for those of the hetrosexual persuasion there is the lovely Valeri Karpinski's body to stare at for a large part of the running time...Gere does his early 80's cheeseball riff on the 'sexiest man alive' circa "American Gigolo" (a MUCH worse film than this) and stares moodily into the camera several times. In his defense, the camera DOES love him, but its slightly overdone and the film begins to take on the tone of a glossy shampoo advert after awhile. In a weird way, that just adds to the fun though. The film is stunning to look at, and it has a strange kinetic energy that makes me overlook the flaws and concentrate on what's right about it. The hero was certainly an inspiration for the style of some of Quentin Tarantino's characters, with his love of "The Silver Surfer", etc. This film is actually referenced in "Reservoir Dogs", according to the IMDb...Cheesy, overblown and tacky at times, but it's an 80's film, so why should you be surprised? In this reviewer's opinion it's still great fun. Be warned, though; If you hate Richard Gere, as my friend does, then stay away, because all this film will do is serve as a 90 + min refresher course in just why you feel that way...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>McBride vs Godard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm working on a paper on the narrative differences/similarities between the original "A Bout de Soufflé" and the American "Breathless". I was more found of the American version, but is this only because this is more common way of telling the story? Is it necessary more effective and entertaining? And how much of the original is actually left in the American version? In addition, both films can be interesting evidence of the culture they were made in, and the "spirit of time", say the 60's in France and the 80's in USA, here it can be helpful with comments on how much this film actually reflects the American culture in the 80's (since I'm from Norway and can say very little about this...) And by "culture" i mostly mean film-culture, say like popular ways of using music in films, camera-work etc. I will be very thankful to comments on this, I'm in the need for inspiration! I'll also be very grateful to completely new approaches to this theme!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Americanized Godard against cartoon-colored backdrops...horrendous to contemplate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad boy from Las Vegas--into stealing cars and reading comic books--chases after a French college student in Los Angeles after a two-night stand in a hotel room has left him breathless. He's anxious to get to Mexico after (rather abstractly) shooting and killing a police officer, but she's more the responsible type and feels torn. American rewrite of 1960's "? bout de soufflé" with the character's nationalities flip-flopped; trendily irresponsible in 1983, but not a good idea then or now. Richard Gere, frequently lapsing into baby talk (with a cigarette dangling from his mouth), tries acting reckless but it's not in him to be a dumb mug. Newcomer Valérie Kaprisky seems to have all the males panting in her wake, but we are never sure why--she runs hot and cold throughout, and her mincing speech patterns are even more annoying than Gere's. Director Jim McBride encourages his stars to go for broke, but the results are still lethargic. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

That's the plot for this "remake" of a supposed classic. The two leads put forward pretty weak peformances, but their un-endearing characters might have something to with that. Not a very good a film, but there are plenty worse out there. If you're a fan of Richard Gere (or even just his genitalia) then 'Breathless' might be for you, but I wouldn't hold my breath. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, this movie, as much as I like it, does have its flaws. There are way too many gratuitous sex scenes, and the cinematography is such that it lends a seedy, B-movie look and feel to the film. However, put those flaws aside, and you have an incredible work of art on your hands.So much about this movie works: The diametric opposition that exists between Monica and Jesse; the impetuous love that steamrolls all obstacles in its path; the soundtrack, each song perfectly underscoring the scene during which it plays; and the action. The film epitomizes and encapsulates the emotions which most thrill us.Richard Gere is superb as Jesse Lujack, a small-time street hustler who harbors an all-consuming passion for the beautiful, enigmatic Architecture student Monica Poiccard, played by Valerie Kaprisky. Many have complained that her French accent is annoying and overdone; but, as in real life, she is French in this movie, so what do you expect? Along the way to begin a new life with her in Mexico, he accidentally kills a cop. This detail unbeknownst to Monica, she succumbs to Jesse's efforts to woo and win her and takes up with him on a high-energy run from the law. But when the full import of the dire situation hits her, she succumbs to a qualm of conscience which puts a very suspenseful spin on the tale.BREATHLESS is decadent, beautiful, romantic, and thrilling. The famous director Quentin Tarrantino must have noted these qualities, too, because he has mentioned this movie as one of his all-time favorites. Watch it and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Cheese Goes Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may actually be the most completely vapid film I have endured to date. Based on the famous French film of the same name, BREATHLESS offers the story of a wannabe rebel and petty criminal who accidentally kills a police officer--and promptly goes on the run with the aid of his unsuspecting girlfriend. But where the original constantly surprised, the remake is uninspired, insipid, and about as enjoyable as a root canal.The big problem with the film is Richard Gere. To give him his due, Gere knocks himself out to inject some life into the predictable plot and mindless script, but there's no way around it: he's incredibly miscast, and his high-energy attempt to bring it off simply adds to the embarrassment. Ultimately, the best thing that can be said for him is that he looks good naked. Valerie Kaprisky operates at much the same level: she too looks good naked, and that's about all one can say for her one way or another.That aside, the whole thing has the look and feel of a group of people trying desperately to do something "different" and "artistic" and failing miserably at every turn. The film looks glossy and expensive, but the production designs are never quite on target and the costuming is some of the worst I've ever seen; the cinematography is jumpy, but never to any actual point; and director Jim McBride either doesn't know what statement he is trying to make or simply doesn't have the skill with which to communicate it. At best, it is all pretentious; at worst, you won't be able to decide between a stiff drink, a pain-killer, or just simply gouging out your eyes so you won't have to watch any more. Life is too short as it is; don't waste your hours on this one.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>godard's "breathless" was a humorous satire of action movies and love stories (among many other things). the fact that "breathless" was remade with richard gere (!!) further proves how shallow and meanless most hollywood movies are. godard's "breathless" was never meant to be taken seriously and by doing so, this remake illustrates all the points godard was trying to make without even realizing it.bottom line: this film should only be watched in conjunction with the original, and even then only for film education. on its own, this film is so bad, it doesn't even have CAMP value!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original version, so I can't say how it compares to this remake. What I can say is that is a real obnoxious movie. Gere's character is so annoying, so loud, that I only kept watching to the very end in hopes I would see him die a painful and bloody death. We learn little to nothing about what motivates this guy, why he is the way he is, etc. I was also at a loss as to why his French girlfriend (who is an equally murky character) was so attracted to this loser.The only interesting thing about the entire production is the directorial style. Though made before "Miami Vice", the sleek look and atmosphere strongly resembles that of the TV show - it can be seen as a taste of the style that was to come.</fullReview>
