		<shortDescription>Let's take a vote</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mild Spoilers)I saw the 1997 remake of this famous play from the `Golden Age of Television'. I've never seen the 1954 original in which Bob Cummings played Juror #8, (The Fonda/Lemmon role). But I have admired the 1957 film for years. Inevitably, when one sees the new version some kind of verdict must be reached on which is better.The story is the same, with a few minor updates. (The case against the defendant seems spectacularly weak and rather easy for the hero to take apart- how could anybody rely on witnesses who heard things over the roar of a passing train or who saw the crime through its windows?) The real comparison is of the characters as played by the different casts of actors, both of which represent an incredible confluence of thespian achievement.Juror #1: This is the jury foreman. He's played by Martin Balsam in the original as a nice guy who just wants everybody to get along. Courtney Vance seems a little more intense while retaining the strong desire for fairness and teamwork Balsam conveyed. In the new one, Vance is a football coach and one can sense that he views himself as the `coach' of this team. My vote goes to Vance.Juror #2: John Fiedler, a short bald-headed actor with a squeaky voice and mild manner played #2 as a guy who just wanted to be helpful and not impose himself on the others. Ossie Davis is a very different actor and his juror #2 is a very different character, a common working man who remembers wise things others have told him and has an instinct for what's right and wrong, even if an uncomplicated one. He could hardly have led the battle for a not guilty finding as #8 does but he recognizes when the man is right. Davis is clearly the more interesting performer here.Juror #3: This is the villain of the piece, who in the end becomes a pathetic figure. He wants to `get this kid' not so much because he's guilty but, it turns out, because he reminds him of his estranged son. He starts out as the garrulously arrogant leader of the wolfpack and, as he loses one ally after another, he seems, (to himself), as the last man at the Alamo until the real reason for his position is revealed to him. It's hard to think of two actors more similar than Lee J Cobb and George C. Scott, both of them lions not just in winter but for all seasons. Scott not only played this role that Cobb had made a meal of- he also played Cobb's most famous role- Willy Loman in `Death of a Salesman'. You could also picture Scott playing Johnny Friendly in `On the Waterfront' or Cobb playing the prosecutor in `Anatomy of a Murder, the manager in `The Hustler' or even `Patton'. The difference here is simply their ages and their states of health. Lee J. Cobb was 46 in 1957 and 19 years away from death and George Scott was 70 in 1997 and only two years from meeting his maker. He's fat, jowly and pretty pathetic looking from the beginning. Cobb is robust and intimidating until he collapses from within. He wins this one big and it's a big win for the old film.Juror #4: In the original this man is played by the wonderful EG Marshall, who would go on to star in Rose's `The Defenders'. He is a man who possesses relentless logic but little imagination. He is able to see what is put in front of him and fit it together but not to view something from multiple perspectives, as could an architect, (Juror #8's profession). Only when the evidence from which he has assembled his point of view is methodically destroyed by #8 does he come to realize he is wrong. As good as Marshall is, I believe Armin Mueller Stahl tops him in the new version. Marshall's #4 is machine-like. Mueller-Stahl is just a regular man whose greatest skill happens to be logical thought, which is admirable but not enough.Juror #5: Jack Klugman could be a powerful actor when he kept him mouth shut. When he talked too much, (as in `Quincy)', he was a little, (maybe a lot), too much. But his understatement in 12 Angry Men serves him much better. Still, I'll take Dorian Harwood's more intense and troubled #5. He seems to be wondering how his fellow jurors would grade him for things he's done.Juror #6: James Gandolfini, several years before `The Sopranos' made him a star, plays a simple hulk of a man who is incapable of complicated thought but has a basic sense of honor. He hates it when anybody tries to push around `the old man', (juror #9). One wonders how the fact that the murder victim was a father played on his mind. (Rose updates his play by having #8 point out the many faults of the father: he drank, pushed around women, etc.,- this seems an unnecessary attempt to create sympathy for the defendant.). The 1957 character is much the same but the underrated Edward Binns plays him much better.Juror #7: Jack Warden was much praised as the guy who just wants to finish in time to go to the ball game. He's always been one of my favorite character actors. Tony Danza is singled out for the most criticism because he's `a sitcom actor'. That said, Danza is quite as good as Warden. By the way, Jack Lemmon was also a `sitcom actor' in 1952's `Heaven for Betsy'.Juror #8: The conscience of us all. Jack Lemmon would at one time have made a meal of this. He's pretty good here, but, like Scott, he's lost something in his old age. He's fat and dumpy and baggy-eyed. He lacks the nervous energy he once had. He can't make the big speeches with as much force as he once would have. Fonda is much stronger and more convincing.Juror #9: The best thing in the new one is the priceless Hume Cronyn as `the old man', who does almost as much to sway his fellow jury members as #8 but seems too frail to stand up to their anger. His key revelation that the testimony of the other old man who was a witness may have been fueled by his desire to `be somebody' is poignant as #9 can obviously identify with that. Joseph Sweeney is competent in this role in the 1957 version but Cronyn is on another level entirely.Juror #10: This is the `other' villain of the piece. His problem is bigotry. Rose cleverly converted the white racist of 1957 into a black racist in 1997, just to show that bigotry takes many forms. Mykelti Williamson gives a strong performance in this role but I still prefer Ed Begley's old wreck of a man, who retreats into a shell after everyone- even #3 rejects him.Juror #11: This is a European immigrant who, perhaps because he is an outsider who has been judged by American Society since he got here, becomes one of the first converts. George Voskovic is fine in the original, Edward James Olmos his equal in the new one.Juror #12: This is an air-headed salesman who sides with whoever looks like they are going to win. Lemmon would have been excellent in this role in 1957. Robert Webber was fine instead. CSI's William Peterson doesn't make much of an impression the remake, (except that he's put on a lot of weight in seven years).So, I'll take Cobb, Binns, Fonda, Begley and Webber from the 1957 film and Vance, Davis, Mueller-Stahl, Harewood and Cronyn from the 1997 TV Movie, with the other two positions a tie. That leaves us with a 5-5-2 tie overall. But it's not really a tie. The two main roles are #8 and #3 and biggest `supporting' role #10 and the 1957 film gets a hat trick on those.But each film is worth spending the time to watch and then watch over again the next time it's on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gives a whole new meaning to the word `remake'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This TV-movie is truly remarkable. It's a remake of an undeniable classic, and that word usually brings tears to your eyes. Remakes normally are a lame excuse used by uninspired directors to make more money out of a good idea. You know the drill of the average remake: bigger, louder and as less tribute to the original as possible. William Friedkin's take on 12 Angry Men is the exact opposite of all this. It's a modest re-telling of the story but obviously made with endless amounts of professionalism and respect towards the original. Taken up to an even higher level by on of the best ensemble casts of the nineties! All members of the jury are familiar faces and some of them give away the best performances in their entire career. The acting level of the cast during some of the intense discussions and debates almost burns holes in the screens?it's that perfect. A very special word of respect and worship goes out to Jack Lemmon, Hume Cronym and George C. Scott. These 3 late legends of the big screen kept on giving amazing performances till they sadly passed away. May their souls rest in piece, cinema will never forget them. Of course, I can't give this version the honor of being better than the original masterpiece starring Henry Fonda, but nevertheless it's an intense and fascinating courtroom drama that'll leave no soul unharmed. Naturally, one could ask the question if it was really necessary to create an update of 12 Angry Men?the answer to that would be ?no' of course, but what the heck. Almost every remake, sequel or spin-off is unnecessary, but that doesn't mean they can't be enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great like the original, but an honest effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have seen the original "12 Angry Men," it's hard not to classify this film as inferior. The acting was better, the cinematography was better, the pace was faster. The cast in the remake is talented, just not as talented. Even the great George C. Scott couldn't quite measure up to Lee J. Cobb. Even the great Jack Lemmon couldn't compare to Henry Fonda. The only actor I felt was an improvement was Mykelti Williamson, who delivers a powerful and disturbing speech towards the end. I see him in mostly small, supporting roles, where he doesn't really get to show off his talent. In this film, Williamson gets the chance to flaunt his overlooked acting chops. One actor who I felt was a big step down was Tony Danza, who doesn't measure up at all to Jack Warden. Danza does an OK job, but dramatic acting isn't his forte. Sitcom acting is his strongsuit. Edward James Olmos does a fine job, but it took time getting over his phony accent. That's right, he's been in this country so long that his Latino accent sounds phony. Nevertheless, the acting is good and the film really muscles up during the third act. If the director sped up the pace and the camerawork wasn't as clumsy, this could've been a much more compelling film. But to be fair, it's a tough job measuring up to the original. We've all seen and heard much of the dialogue (which is almost word-for-word from the original script, only with a few obscenities, one racial slur and modern references like "Fat Albert" added), so hearing it again is like listening to a stand-up comedian using his old material. Funny stuff, but we've heard it before. Only a good comedian will usually maintain a good delivery of the joke, while the delivery of some of the old dialogue is limp this time around.My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the original 1957 film, this remake is a taut drama. Unlike most remakes, this one is as good as the first. The script still stands up as a gritty revelation of human psychology. The cast is solid, and the characters are more diverse than in the original. Look at both versions and see a study not only in the workings of human nature but also in the workings of script adaptation at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unnecessary remake but well-cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether or not we really needed a remake of the famous Henry Fonda film, updated with a range of nationalities and transferred to television, this is a well-enough done update benefiting from some strong actors in the cast. Jack Lemmon takes on the voice of dissent (the Fonda role), while George C Scott is the redneck extremist (played earlier by Lee J Cobb). We also have Hume Cronyn and Ossie Davis, both fine actors in their eighties or thereabouts by the time this was filmed.The script has been slightly updated but the premise is the same, all about family betrayals and the head-on reassessment of prejudice. Lemmon in particular is excellent as the quiet reasoner ready to debate the whys and wherefores with his fellow jurors. And Scott is memorable in one of his final roles, simmering on the edge of indignation until the pay off moment when he realises not all his problems can be solved by pinning blame on others.This shouldn't replace the 50s version but is good enough in its own right to stand alongside it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>12 men, one life at stake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie was like peeling an onion- the more it progressed the more the heart of the real matter was revealed. The ideas this movie fosters- the certainty that everyone enters the jury room with a hidden agenda were proven. Most of all it brings to light the fact that justice and money are connected. I was in awe of both Jack Lemmon and Hume Cronyn- how they were men of courage. Though the whole movie is set in a jury room it never lacks for tension and action. This movie should be required for every person who ever has to serve on a jury.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exception to the rule</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young man(Douglas Spain) is accused of murder. It is a hot summer day in a jury room. Most of the jurors have better things to do, and want to get out of there. One man, Juror #8(Jack Lemmon), decides not to jump to conclusions. He uses reason and logic to help prove to the other jurors that there is a reasonable doubt, and there is not enough evidence to convict this man. Juror #8 has to convince a bigot, Juror #10(Mykelti Williamson), a man who refuses to admit he may be wrong, Juror #4(Armin Mueller-Stahl), a man who has something against young people, Juror #3(George C. Scott), and a man who just wants to get out of there, even if it means making an unjust choice, Juror #7(Tony Danza).Lemmon, Scott, Williamson, Stahl, and even Danza put on great performances. This is an exception to the rule that remakes can't be great. This was a brilliant film. Like in the original, tempers flare as it is a hot day and there is no air conditioner. William L. Petersen, Edward James Olmos, Hume Cronyn, James Gandolfini, Dorian Harewood, Ossie Davis, and Courtney B. Vance all play as jurors too. Every juror does a great job. Every character has a story and view point.If you liked the classic or play, you should definitely see this remake. I strongly recommend this movie. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last night, I attempted to rent the b&amp;w classic at the the local video store only to find that they had switched the classic with the remake (which I realized only after I got it home). I figured I might as well give it a try. Honestly, it wasn't a bad movie, but it doesn't even begin to compare with the original (which is one of my all-time favorites). An attempt has been made update the movie by adding minorities and modernizing some of the dialog. Some of this works, some of it doesn't. Also, a few of the roles in the remake are badly miscast (Tony Danza and Ozzie Davis both come to mind).I'd give this version 6/10 and the original gets a 10/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great remake of a great classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of ''12 Angry Men''is awesome! I didn't watched the original version of this movie, but I liked very much this version,so I guess the first one is so great or even better then this one.(I will watch it eventually) 12 jurors need to conclude if a boy accused to have killed his father, is guilty or non guilty. The majority of them believes that the boy is guilty, with the exception of only one of the jurors (the juror number 8). Since the boy's penalty will be death sentence, the juror number 8 wants to know the arguments and reasons before giving a conclusion,making everybody to think very well about all the case and to forget their hypocrisy.This movie is spectacular and make us think very well about the process of the things,specially in Court. I liked the cast very much as well, even not knowing many of the actors, I think their job was terrific!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lugubrious self indulgent twaddle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of a classic simply sucked. The blame falls squarely on the shoulders of the director.If I could do a shot by shot, role by role comparison, the major difference is that in this remake the actors are so visibly "ACTING". Each line is freighted with meaning as if it was the most important utterance in theatrical history. The camera angles and lighting all re-enforce these scenery chewing interpretations.For example in the original we have a man commenting on the rain and telling a simple story about losing a football game because of heavy rain. That's it a bit of exposition an almost throw away line of character development. In the remake that same bit is treated as some quasi-mystical life lesson, an epochal moment in time. The character changes from a guy passing time to a bore who thinks the world revolves around his part time job as an assistant football coach.Each and every speech in this remake is treated in the same way. There is not one line small enough that it's not treated with the attention usually reserved to Shakespearian soliloquies.The acting is often bad and that's frequently not the fault of the actors. It's the director that tells the actors to dial it up or down. It's the director that sees the whole picture. The pacing of this remake is amazingly slow and that makes its 117 min run time seem like 3 hours. The original was 96 minutes and was over before you noticed the time.I would love to go into greater detail but that would require I watch this movie again, and that ain't happening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fairly good remake featuring multitalented performers that are not optimally used</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The hardest part of reviewing a remake is avoiding comparing it to the original. The same holds true here.The story behind "12 Angry Men" is one of the greatest of our time and is a must-see for all, whether it is on stage, on TV, or in the movie theater. I personally think the 1957 original is the best made, but the fact that that was the first version I saw and that that is the "classic" version has probably made me a tad bit biased.That all being said, this made-for-TV version of the story is done well. Unfortunately, it does, in every way, feel like a made-for-TV movie, which is unfortunate considering the immense talent pool of the cast (made up of everyone from old legends like George C. Scott, Ossie Davis, and Jack Lemmon to newer stars like Tony Danza, Courtney B. Vance, Mykelti Williamson, James Gandolfini, and Edward James Olmos). Each of these men is capable of doing a great deal more than they show in this movie. It feels almost like they are forcing themselves to act and so the performances are not believable. In short, nobody ever really gets "into character."Part of the reason might be because so many of the actors do not personally reflect their characters. For example, Jack Lemmon and George C. Scott both look significantly older than "the old man" (Juror #9). Edward James Olmos is supposed to play "the foreigner," but Armin Mueller-Stahl, the man playing the wealthy and dignified Juror #4, speaks with a very noticeable German accent.Even though I wanted to avoid it, I think I will do a point-by-point critique of the actors' performances based on how their characters were designed and based, somewhat, on the nearly flawless performances in the 1957 classic: Juror #1 - Courtney B. Vance does a fairly good job, but his delivery is not very natural at all. Juror #2 - Ossie Davis is a very talented actor and plays his role well. The only possible bone I have to pick is that his character is supposed to be a meek young man, whereas Ossie Davis plays as a meek, older man. Juror #3 - George C. Scott is an acting legend and plays the character as well, though he plays the role very angrily and, I think, not sarcastically enough. In some places, he overdoes it. But still, I can see Lee J. Cobb's performance in him. Juror #4 - Well done performance by Armin Mueller-Stahl; just the accent issue. Juror #5 - Dorian Harewood, another good actor. Problem: his character is supposed to start off shy and slowly gain some aggression. Harewood's character is aggressive from the get-go. Juror #6 - James Gandolfini plays his part well. Not much to criticize. Juror #7 - Not bad, Tony Danza. Jack Warden, we must admit, is much better at playing a loud-mouth like Juror #7 than Tony Danza, partly because Warden speaks so loudly anyway. Juror #8 - Jack Lemmon is another acting legend, but his acting here seems tired and forced. It's not as natural as Henry Fonda's performance in the classic version. Juror #9 - The "old man" is not old enough, plain and simple. (Actually, his age is fine. It's just that everyone else is too old and it makes him look young.) Juror #10 - Okay, Mykelti Williamson simply does not cut it when it comes to Ed Begley's original, hateful bigot. Williamson plays more of a I'm-mad-at-the-whole-world-just-because character than a bigot. Juror #11 - Awesome job by Edward James Olmos, comparable to the original. Juror #12 - Also a fairly good job by William Petersen (of "CSI" fame). Again, not as good as Robert Webber's original, but still good.Okay, I didn't want to have to do that, but I did. So sue me. :)Now that I've shown that this version does not compare with the original, I will compliment it enough to say that it is still worth watching. It features a class of good albeit under-used actors and the story is the most important part. The exploration of humanity and the jury process and our biases and human nature and so much more can all be seen in the story of "12 Angry Men."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"24 angry men" ? comparison of 1957 original and 1997 TV remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These comparison notes resulted from something I've wanted to do for a long time ? watching the two "12 angry men" back to back in one sitting. Obviously, a detailed comparison is not feasible with the length limit of IMDb user comments. A small monograph would serve better. Indeed the original movie has been used as material for corporate training courses on relating styles.The following comparison is therefore confined to the cast of the 12 jury members. The big picture was of course an updating of the times ? while in 1957, it was an entirely White cast, the remake saw 4 Blacks (1, 2, 5 and 10). But colour is entirely incidental in this movie, as in "Lilies of the field" (1963) in which Sidney Poitier won his Oscar.For Juror #1, Martin Balsam plays a slightly tentative foreman, or at least not as self-assured as Courtney B. Vance's portrayal 40 years later. Both handle the sentimental scene of baseball-in-the-rain quite well.Juror #2, the people-generally-ignore guy, is handled quite differently in the two versions. John Fiedler plays a nerdy little man who can however turn cheeky at the right moment. Ossie Davis' portrayal is an out-and-out grass-root guy that is consistently humble in manner even when the content of his lines could be cheeky, like throwing back things said by Jury #3 right in his face.Juror #3, coincidentally or otherwise, is played by two great actors who both include the middle initial as part of their name. While portrayal of the "bad guy" is similar throughout most of the movie, the finale "breakdown" scene is handled slightly differently. Lee J. Cobb's version is slightly briefer and less emotional, with the breakdown triggered by catching sight of his picture with his son. George C. Scott's portrayal, however, is more emotional with thoughts of his own son triggered when he talks about the accused boy's purported shout to his father "I'm going to kill you". Interesting to note that because of the difference in the gentlemen's age when they took the role, in character in Cobb's case has not seen his son for only 2 years while in Scott's case it's 20 years.Juror #4, the most logical and analytical of the bunch, was played in 1957 by E. G. Marshall, as down-to-earth and dispassionate as the role requires. Armin Mueller-Stahl in 1997 comes across as a little more "academic" and less practical in flavor. Or maybe Marshall's persona for the role has been too firmly ingrained.The man-from-the-slumps, Juror #5 who is the third to change his vote to "not guilty", comes across very much alike in the portrayals by Jack Klugman and Dorian Hare and as I said, the colour difference is just incidental.Juror #6 is the typical blue-collar worker who claims that he "lets the boss do the thinking". But don't be deceived because he is also the one who comes up with the sharp retort to Juror #8 in the washroom, "Suppose we come up with a not guilty verdict and the accused did kill his father." He and Juror #6 change their votes to "not guilty" together, turning the result to a dead even 6-to-6. Ed Binns (a versatile actor who a few years later played a Senator in "Judgment at Nuremberg") plays the role more ore less on face value while James Gandolfini displays just a little more subtle intelligence and authority.Juror #7, the man whose interest is only in catching the baseball game in the evening, is a somewhat superficial character, and the role is handled effectively by Jack Warden and later Tony Danza.Henry Fonda's Juror #8, the hero of the story, makes such a deep and long impression that it's difficult to imagine anyone else playing it. It requires some effort to give Jack Lemmon an unbiased consideration. It seems that Juror #8 forty years later has become more emotional, angrier and louder. Come to think of it, you can say the same thing about the entire mood of the remake, which may simply reflect the change in the times.Juror #9, the "old man", is the first to change his vote to "not guilty" in support of Juror #8's gutsy "gamble". Joseph Sweeney plays this character with such confidence that you'll forget about his age. Hume Cronyn plays it with a little more fragile vulnerability.Juror #10 is the uncontested top ass**** in the story, with prejudice and discrimination written all over him. Ed Begley brings out the cold, dry, contemptible character well. Mykelti Williamson (who plays an excellent "Bubba" in "Forrest Gump"), tackles the character somewhat differently, with a trace of I-don't-really-give-a-sh** resignation that is not seen in Begley's portrayal.Juror #11, the European immigrant watchmaker, the fourth man to change his vote to "not guilty", is a character with matching precision ? patience, mannered upbringing, clear sense of right and wrong. Both George Voskovc and Edward James Olmos have done an excellent job, with the latter displaying a touch more of icy coolness.Juror #12 the salesman is well played by both Robert Webber and William L. Peterson in the portrayal of the indecisive character and disinterest in the court case. He, together with Jurors # 1 and 7, are the most "undecided" three, forming the bunch that is the next to change their vote to "not guilty" after the 6/6 split. The remaining 3 are the die-hards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"12 Angry Men '97" is one of the few examples that a remake can be just as great as the original. This version of the 1957 drama is awesome. It had the same tension and verbal action as its predessor, but with more familiar characters and even color! Jack Lemmon replaces Henry Fonda as the good juror #8, the late great George C. Scott succeeds Lee J. Cobb as the hate-filled juror #3, and Mykelti Williamson takes a really good turn as the nasty juror #10 (he's sure as hell not looking for "shrimp" in this flick, if you know what I mean! And check out his cool hat! He looks like a younger Jim Brown). Each member of this jury take their tolls as they all argue over the life of a teen who is accused of murdering his father with switchblade. And each of them would like to leave the stuffy jury room!Unlike the original, "12 Angry Men '97" is more modernized; for example, instead of electric fans, an air conditioner cools down the hot temperature of the room, and the jury isn't an all-white ensemble, but a multi-ethnic group. That's why I like this version better because there isn't a lot of racial boundaries to go over here, unlike in the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was his own father!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet's 12 Angry Men is not only a great courtroom film but a great film in itself, so anything that follows must be hard pressed to keep up. The story, originally from Reginald Rose, is largely unchanged. Twelve men have a boy's life put into their hands, and eleven of them are angry enough to be rid of him immediately. The casting enables something that was less prominent in the 50s, a multi-racial cast. In addition to the judge now being female, there are now four African-American jurors in addition to the original non-American watchmaker (and another with an obvious German accent, which is curiously never addressed). If the casting of the black jurors could add a new angle to the story, Friedkin does not run with it. What he instead does is play race against race, minority against minority. They might have the same skin colour, and might initially address each other as 'brother', but their views could not be more different. Juror 10 is in fact a racist of another level, with hints of severed ties with the Nation of Islam. So not only is he a racist, but he is a racist that even other racists cannot stand. But there is a sorely missed opportunity here. Perhaps the most emphatic scene of Lumet's was the gradual and dramatic turning of the backs of the jurors towards the racist tirade, and Ed Begley spluttering and slowly having his loud, pushy persona deflating before our very eyes. When he does vote guilty, he is utterly defeated. Here, Mykelti Williamson is not confronted with the same level of contempt, and his beliefs are not even challenged. When he finally changes his vote, it is not a moral victory, but him merely conceding his own vengeance against the Hispanic race. The other prominent 'antagonist' of the story is juror 3, whose inhibitions are sourced from his resentment towards his own son. Lee J. Cobb was an ugly-faced bully throughout, so grotesque and intimidating that it made it all the more effective when he caves in. George C. Scott can't quite match this constant intensity, although he would have been the clear winner in his prime, making full use of his famous temper. But he does improve the climax of the character, only because his version is a much older man and he has the ability to make his face crumble and crease inwards as he sobs over his estranged son. He takes the accused's words truly to his heart. It is a much more pitiful affair when his age brings in the issue of grandparents and connections missed. And then there is the all-important juror 8, the moral compass of the group, the one who isn't so easily swayed. Lemmon isn't as firm as Fonda, that is to be sure. He can't sell the glint in his eye as well, and when he pulls out the second identical knife and rams it into the table, it is a rather feeble move. Because Lemmon looks to be one of the oldest of them all, the dynamics are shifted. It is not his inherent good-nature that affords him the ability to not flinch at the stabbing of the knife, but perhaps a mutual understanding with juror 3 and a lifetime of wisdom and experience at reading others. Lemmon was always at the top of his game when he brimmed with his trademark nervous energy. That is not to say that he is no effective with that vitality gone - you only have to witness the pathetic man in Glengarry Glen Ross to be proved wrong there. But this role is ultimately the wrong fit for Lemmon. It asks for resoluteness, something that he would respond to by turning away and a creased smile. In the original, Boris Kaufman had a way of compressing the space within the cramped, stuffy juror's room in addition to the flaring tempers and disagreements. He slowly cranked up the focal length, squeezing the depth of field and the actors together in the telephoto (except, of course, for that errant shot of Joseph Sweeney in urgent close-up). He used heat to create claustrophobia as if they were sitting in a pressure cooker, and raised the temperature gradually, making the men's foreheads shimmer, until finally allowing the rain to wash it all away. Visually, Friedkin's version might have made the most departure. The heat is treated as an afterthought; though we see pools of sweat on their bodies, they don't glisten with the same intensity, so the rain doesn't have a defined role. The camera hovers constantly behind shoulders, and cannot stop swiveling and moving in and around the table, which goes against the very idea of claustrophobia. The characters often stand and leave their seats, but not for any known reason. The lack of dramatic staging is the most disappointing aspect here. But it is hard to measure up to perfection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie had one simple story. The story was to be told by 12 men. As they examine the character and the plot of the movie, their characters are examined and developed. Jack Lemmon's performance in this movie was amazing. Even better was G.C Scott's performance. The frailties and the strengths of each character made their stories very believable. I thought some actors could have done better, but in a weird way, their character in the movie supported the weak performance. I know, it sounds weird but that is my observation. Space-wise, the movie had very little to work with. It had an abundance of characters in that very little space and the script was so well written for all characters to have some relevance or the clear lack of it in that room. I will recommend this drama any day. For added effect (totally unnecessary), play this movie again with the monitor off and pretend you are eavesdropping on the jury. If that does not do it for you, nothing will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Agreat classic remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two words pop to mind of course, classic and remake. This is a remake so originality is not a factor (very rarely is this the case); one would want to know how close to the original is this remake. Script wise, there is no noticeable difference. The Director is one who has made his reputation and has a filmography to be proud; I am as much a fan of Friedkin as I am of Lumet but for different reasons because their works are not parallel. The cast is again one terrific ensemble but this time more viewers will know that cast better because of the 40 years update. The exception is Jack Lemmon and George C. Scott; they are the counterparts to Henry Fonda and Lee J Cobb. The roles of Juror # 8 and # 3 are the most important because the former is the juror who the lone voice of dissent at the beginning while the latter is the last one to change his mind. As much as I like Lemmon, Fonda delivered a more captivating performance; oddly, I found Scott did the same, but for the last version of the film.The things that were noticeable in this remake, when comparing to the original, are: 1-The jury room is slightly bigger, not much but it is noticeable. 2- The composition of the jury itself, there were no African Americans in the original, while this 1997 versions has enough to give what was originally a jury with bigots is now a jury with racists, in my opinion. And the dialogue is the same as far as I could tell; it just has that slight slant switch. In any case, both are worth seeing but if the original had been in color and had one or two African Americans, I doubt there would have been a remake. I would hate for yet another remake to be made just to insert women and Muslims. To get the point of this movie is to know that an all white jury or a more representative jury must go through the same thought process and window dressing it could simply take away from the masterpiece, just for commercialism. Let's hope we leave well enough alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>12 Angry Men :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 angry men is a taut drama that is set in a jury room. It was directed by William Friedkin. It has actors like James Gandolfini and Jack Lemmon.A kid from the slums is on trial for the suspected murder of his father. The 12 jurors have to sieve through all of the evidence and the witness' testimonies and convict the kid accordingly. Most of the jurors have better things to do, and want to get out of there. Juror NO#8 says not guilty and the other 11 jurors are in uproar over his decision. He puts out his views and tries to sway them to change their decisions to not guilty.There was a pretty good selection of actors that were chosen for the cast of the jurors. They created a lot of atmosphere in the small, humid juror's room. There is a mix of characters, some quite outspoken like NO#3 played by George C Scott and NO#8 played by Jack Lemmon. Jurors like NO#12, NO#11 and NO#5 were really quite but had some really good points in regards to new and old evidence. Although it was set in the juror's room for the whole movie, it didn't take way from the overall feel of large scale conflict and tension.I found the movie rather interesting but it didn't have much substance. I've always enjoyed crime shows because I can sit there and try decoding the evidence and finding out who's guilty and what not. I would recommend this to people that like pretty tense drama's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This 1997 version stands on it's own merit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men, the Henry Fonda version made in 1957 has always been my favourite film, due to many factors.I have just watched 12 Angry Men, the 1997 remake, with Jack Lemmon.Being an absolute fan of Henry Fonda, and his own 1957 Produced version, directed by Sidney Lumet, I was not expecting what I experienced on screen. I expected a grossly inferior version.But what I got in the 1997 version is not just great acting from all concerned, but also extra dialogue written by Reginald Rose himself, and because of this extra dialogue, we have not only a longer film, but also a very non politically correct film in the sense that Henry Fonda's version is stiff, and is very politically correct, even if this adds to it's charm.This 1997 version is not stiff. Directed by William Friedkin, it's much broader, notably because the characters are given a broader range of harder hitting dialogue.There is one scene in the 1957 version which hits home to me, it's when Lee J. Cobb is having a go at the old man on the jury, and Edward Binns another juror, steps in and stands up for the old man.In the 1997 version , Soporanos actor, James Gandolfini plays Edward Binns part, but is given more to say.Each character in the 1997 version is given more to say, which adds to the atmosphere of the story.I recommend this 1997 version, because it does stand on its own merit. As does the 1957 version.Two great movies based on a stage play by Reginald Rose, of how one man, refuses to go along with the other jurors, and takes a stand and just wants to talk, because it's "just possible" that the boy is "not guilty".EXCELLENT.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second Best Is Still Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I vote with the majority (and not because I lack the courage to stand up for my conviction!) and hereby decree the older version better than the newer. I have to admit, though, that while there are several solid reasons to prefer Fonda's show to Lemmon's, a good portion of my bias comes from having known and loved the earlier one for so long a time. I really mean it when I say I *love* it; I watch it a couple or three times every year, sometimes more, and come away from each viewing with something new that I had not appreciated before.Now that I've clearly pronounced the winner, let me take a little space here to extol and console the also-ran. It's a great piece of work, and it comes up even greater when you consider it was a made-for-TV project. The unfortunate thing is that any viewers who're familiar with the first film watch the re-make while visions of sugarplums dance in their heads, Fonda et al being the sweetmeats in mind here. This is not to say that the Lemmon bunch wasn't a juicy treat in its own right (has it EVER been less than a treat to watch Scott or Davis?). But it's hard to give the new kids your undivided attention when comparisons to the old are being simulcast by your brain, despite your best attempts not to notice.A few observations that serve to raise the later version above the earlier in specific places were inescapable, however. The highly experienced Cronyn was more insightful, even when not speaking, than was Sweeney, who had fewer major screen credits under his belt at the time he appeared as the elderly juror in the first film. The same is true, though less so, of the well seasoned Davis as opposed to Fiedler, much Davis's junior and whose performance was pretty much perfect to the degree the role allowed. Davis was brilliant, but more importantly, the role morphed into something fleshier by the time he undertook it. For him, the part was that of a racial minority member who had been recognizing and surviving prejudice longer than the other African American jurors. It was as if he became, right before the viewers' eyes, a revered elder sage, capable of offering counsel and/or chastisement to the hotter blooded Williamson. For my money, nobody but nobody serves up a more convincing bigot than Begley, but as with Davis's, Williamson's role included the additional dimension bestowed upon a character in a story about racism who is himself from a racial minority. Jurors 2 and 10 were just plain different characters from one film to the next, and all 4 actors were admirable.Keep in mind that as dear as you may hold Pepsi and Oprah for their own stellar qualities, the truth is that they followed and imitated Coke and Phil Donahue. There's nothing wrong with being a truly talented new kid as long as you can accept that when the original you trail was not merely exceptional but groundbreaking, your uniquely crafted attributes will never appear all that unique.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOTHING beats this original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why make another version of this movie? I just finished watching the 1957 version and I admit it seems like a play (and probably was developed originally as a play since it basically takes place in one room) and it was also broadcast live during the heyday of the golden years of television. We'll never see the talent of the actors in the room who have since passed-away. In fact, only Jack Klugman (at age 85) is still with us. Other movies seem tailor-made for plays, such as Glengarry Glen Ross. I'm not sure if the casting was simply dead-on or the actors happened to nail the roles they had or a combination, but each person seems very well-suited to his role and it's hard not to get wrapped up in the dialog and the general pace of the movie (as though you were peering into the jury room through a peephole). In fact, as I watched each actor, I identified with people I knew who had the same characteristics, such as Jack Warden's wise-ass, or Ed Begley, Sr.'s angry racist or Lee J. Cobb's uptight, high-strung yelling man or any of the other people. I do think that Jack Klugman's role may have been miscast. I didn't necessarily identify with him as a product of the slums. They could have cast a minority for his role but I guess in 1957 all-white, male juries were what was the norm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great story is believed made by great acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think remakes are good when it is a good story such as this one, that touches incredibly important issues that have no time. The people, the jurors, calling themselves by their numbers, regardless of their races or creed, have many fears and beliefs in common, and so they have doubts and arguments for each. I didn't know that there was an older version, but I can assure you, I enjoyed greatly the performances of each. Of course one character one likes more than the other but then I put myself in that position and wonder what would I agree on. Also the diversity of ethnic background, which I don't believe was thought of back in the fifties, makes it a better movie to be understood in our times, while even tho the first story must have had the same characters personalities, this one is set on a different man, to show that good morals, ample intelligence and reasonable doubt is human and not belonging to a certain race.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>12 angry men 1997</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people may not think that this movie is as good as the original version, however, even though there are changes in the script, this movie depicts the view of our society. The cast, language and and scenario are more familiar in our modern world. Many times we get turned off by the black and white movies, just because of the black and white fact, but this movie brings the same idea and at the same time we can relate to the way we live nowadays. The fact that Henry Fonda is still alive to redo this movie is what impresses the most, specially if people watch both versions. The original movie is incredible, may be even better than the 1997 version, but owning both copies and watching them one after the other is a treat for all. Tony Danza was the perfect actor for the role of the baseball fan and the fact the there is a female actress brings more credibility to our times. This movie was printed on DVD in Australia (Region 4) and on VHS in America. Does anyone know if this movie is printed on DVD in USA and Canada (Region 1)? If so, Where could it be purchased? You may mail me at davidtamm@hotmail.com and I would write this information on this site for all interested in purchasing such DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>These are Twelve REALLY Angry Men!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that will not be appealing to everyone. It is not an action movie, and except for the bailiff and for the very end of the movie when they go into the courtroom, you only see the twelve men, who really do turn into twelve angry men. Among these, are some very famous and well seasoned actors. George C. Scott, Jack Lemon, Hume Cronym are the ones that I recognized from old times, and then there are also Tony Danza and James Gandofini when they were very young and "wet behind the ears". Sorry, but I do not recognize any of the others.In addition, the scenery does not change either, for they are all locked in a room and the entire two hours of the movie is about the deliberation that goes on in that room. It is far from boring though, for they all raise some very interesting points to consider when convicting a man accused of a crime.The movie opens in the courtroom for just a brief moment as the attorneys are both resting their case and the judge is instructing the jury to deliberate. Douglas Spain, as the accused boy, is hopelessly looking up at the ceiling fan as he is anticipating the guilty verdict that would ultimately come to him. It seems that he had been accused of stabbing his own father to death, going to a movie afterwards, and then returning home at 3AM to be arrested by the police. There were two witnesses who both claimed that they saw him. The first was a woman who said she saw him through the window as he stabbed his father, and the second was an old man who lived there, who claimed he saw him leave the apartment afterwards and run down the stairs.Once all the men were in the jury room, it seemed to be an "open and shut case". All were SURE that he had committed the crime. All except for one: Juror #8, played by Jack Lemon. He never said that he thought the kid was innocent. In fact he said that he was PROBABLY GUILTY, but what if--just WHAT IF we are wrong? What if he really HAD gone to the movies that night, so he was not even there when it happened? What if he really had been telling the truth all along? that he had not killed his own father? This was a capital crime with capital punishment involved. He could be put to death for this crime. Could these jurors afford to be wrong and have it on their consciouses if they later discover that they had convicted the wrong man and sent him to death? After all, it had been done before.(The name Dr. Richard Kimball (The Fugitive) comes to mind. This TV Series/Movie was based on a true story. He hadn't been put to death, but in real life, he lost I think about 20 or so years in jail before he could finally prove his innocence.)I had to laugh as I saw some of these jurors vacillate from "definitely guilty" to "innocent", to "probably guilty", and then to "innocent" again as they are confronted by the others for changing their minds. Some of their reasons for "knowing" that he was guilty are funny too. One man, a black man, was sure that he was guilty just because he was a Mexican, and he said that "everybody knows that the Mexicans are benefiting from the years of hard work that the blacks had done to gain equality". Another man saw his own son in this kid, and he was mad at his son, so he was mad at this kid and therefore the kid was guilty. Another funny thing were their reasons for "getting it over with" so they could go home. Tony Danza, for example, wanted it over "in about 5 minutes" because he had tickets for the ball game and that was more important.The movie was filled with suspense as it moved along: Suspense that made you wonder if they would EVER come to a verdict. (The voting MUST be unanimous.)I do not normally watch this type of movie, but I enjoyed this one. I give it a 10, not just because of the acting, the suspense, and the drama involved, but also because it is an excellent tool for anyone who is chosen to serve on a jury. I think that every juror should have to watch this movie beforehand as a prerequisite so he/she would keep the seriousness in mind of the possibility of making the wrong decision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dreaded Jury Duty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie "12 Angry Men" has been made twice. The original version of the movie was made in 1957 and a remake for TV was made in 1997. I watched the TV version of the movie. This movie is about a jury who is deciding the fate of a young eighteen year old Mexican boy. The young boy is accused of murdering his father who is an abusive parent. The boy has been in and out of trouble all of his life. The young boy has served a jail sentence in a juvenile detention for earlier crimes committed. The jury is told to retire to the jury room and decided the fate of the young man's life. The case looks like an open and shut case to every one in the jury except for juror #eight (Jack Lemmon). After many heated confrontations with the rest of the jury, juror #eight still insists that the young man may be innocent.The critical intention in this movie can come off in different ways. The most common way of saying this movies critical intention is 'don't judge a book by its cover.' Every juror, except for one, believes that the young Mexican boy is guilty of murder of his father. Every juror has a different reason why they believe he is guilty. Most of the reasons they believe he is guilty is because of discrimination and stereotyping of the young man. Other reasons include bad experiences with other children, environmental effects, and personal reasons. Critical technique used often in this movie in terms of claustrophobic. The film is set in a jury room for the whole movie. There are only about five windows in the main room and also has a bathroom. The only contact they have with the outside world is what they can see out of the windows and the bailiff who has only a miniscule role in the movie. The bathroom in this movie is used as a secret room where one man can discuss his true feelings to another man about the case and not in front of the jury. The day of the trial is recorded as one of the hottest of the year; this is used as an environmental effect on the jury. The heat is used as a breaking variable of the jury against each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than "made-forTV" quality**SPOILERS**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't recall if I rented this movie or saw it on cable the first time I viewed it. I did not realize after seeing it a few times that it was a made for TV movie nor did I realize that it was a remake. At that time, I would have given it a solid 7 out of 10 (with a bump or two for the performances of a few of the actors). Later (after seeing a few times), I discovered that it was a "made-for-TV" movie. I had to update my impression to a 9 out of 10 because I have seen so few `made-for-TV's' of such caliber.This evening, I just saw the original (1957) screenplay with Henry Fonda. Without a doubt, it was done quite well and I enjoyed it thoroughly. It also forced me to compare the remake to the original for, yet another, update to my personal rating system. My "pluses" (in favor) of the remake are as follows:1. The casting was excellent - with the exception of Glengarry Glen Ross (also starring Jack Lemmon), I don't think I could come up with a better line-up. Though most of the cast could be interchangeable between versions, the ones that really shone over the original cast were Ossie Davis, Armin Mueller-Stahl, James Gandolfini, Mykelti Williamson, and Edward James Olmos and, especially George C. Scott.2. Without steering too far away from the original script, the actors in the remake seemed to portray emotions that were truly more believable.3. With the exception of a decided lack of female jurors, I think the jury in the remake was more representative of what you would expect to see in a modern day jury (the original could have just as easily been called "Twelve Angry White Men". As one other poster mentioned, seeing a minority accurately portraying the racist and a Latino portraying an Eastern European was quite refreshing.4. George C. Scott's performance was 100% more believable than Lee J. Cobb's (especially at the end of the flick). He talks and acts very much the same way as my next-door neighbor (a REAL person) - making him all the more realistic. Though I'm sure that L. J. Cobb would have been just as capable of that kind of performance had it not been for the more understated direction of the 1950's.My "minuses" are:1. Though the story and dialog fit well in either time period, it seemed like there was a missed opportunity to try something new in the script. With limited exception, the script was almost verbatim to the original. In a nutshell, what was the point of remaking it if you were going to stick that close to the original script and dialog? Granted, it might be a mistake to tamper with such a decent script - but then again, it is a mistake to replicate it as well.2. Dorian Harewood's recognition and story behind the `stiletto' and its usage were very weak. Jack Klugman handled that transition much better in the original.3. Tony Danza's lines in the beginning of the flick came off a bit `forced' and heavy-handed. After seeing his first few lines, I thought that he was going to perform like I would have expected of a sitcom actor - but he did prove me wrong as the film went on. Had the script been adjusted, I'm sure that he would have been able to do a better job because he did so well throughout the rest of the flick.4. Based upon the plotline, I would strongly doubt that any prosecutor would attempt to run with a first-degree murder rap. Even with all of the `overwhelming' evidence, any modern day prosecutor would have gone with second-degree murder (or even aggravated assault / manslaughter rap) to guarantee a guilty verdict. This should have been addressed in the remake by either reducing the charges more accurately or reducing the amount of background history of the kid enough to limit the amount of sympathy he would receive (without eliminating the motive angle it provided).Overall, looking at the film in the category of a "remake", I would have to adjust my scoring back a notch to an 8 out of 10. Definitely worth seeing more than once. I would have to give the original a 6 out of 10 - not for any shortcomings, mind you, it's just that it didn't seem to stand out from the crowd of drama flicks of the same era. I would like to watch it again</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stands on its own merit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have viewed both versions of this film, and both have merit, although I like the original better. Now, part of my preference is no doubt due to having seen it first. I think it is staged better, has better direction, and the acting is of a higher caliber. That's not to say that the acting and direction aren't good here; it is quite good. I think the big difference is that the original was cast almost entirely with character actors, when that label really meant something. These actors immersed themselves in their character. Now, this version has many fine character performances, but, I feel that a greater majority of the actors gave the same performance that they would in any other role. Where I think this version was superior was that it addressed several issues in the plot that are ignored in the original.Spoilers-This version addresses the idea that if the accused is innocent, who else had a motive to kill the victim. In this case, the victim was an ex-con, a gambler, a womanizer, and a drunkard. It also introduced psychological evidence that would certainly be part of a more contemporary case. It also plays many of the actors against type. The racist is a black man. Edward James Olmos plays an Eastern European immigrant, rather than a Latino. Ossie Davis plays a timid man. The production turns the viewers preconceptions on their ear and it works well.I think it would be interesting to see this staged with one or more women on the jury, as well. The part of the dissenting juror, Henry Fonda in the original and Jack Lemmon here, would take on a new dimension if it were played by a woman. Imagine, the lone female juror who stands against 11 men. It would certainly change the dynamics of the arguments. Several women would lessen that dynamic but would bring new perspective to some of the evidence. Or, imagine all women, or all minorities. The premise allows for many permutations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just read some comments on this film and I am just now trying to add my point of view on this film.The main point highlighted by the comments is that it does not meet the original's standards. I believe it does.I have seen both the classic 1957 movie with Henry Fonda and the 1997 remake with Jack Lemmon. The second one is almost half an hour longer. I admit there are a few odd changes in the second one (lines have gone from an actor to another), but I am still convinced the second one is not least than the original.("Original"... which is already a remake of the play filmed for TV by Sidney Lumet)This remake was the opportunity to correct some of the details of the Reginald Rose one, such as the discussion about the motives of the crime, or to make George C Scott older.All that could be criticised or praised, this to my mind improved it a little bit, but above all I would say the second one (well, I actually saw it first) is more realistic, more human than the first one, probably because of this wider range of race and social background of the jury.Well, it just changed my life and the way I look at others (at Tony Danza definitely, but in fact at any person I meet). I have seen the Friedkin one about 20 times and the Rose one just four or five times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** This story is from a teleplay written by Reginald Rose and first screened in the early 50's and later made into the classic film version by Sidney Lumet. Having seen that version a few years ago, I was stunned to realize there was a remake. What! How can you top that superb production? Just look at the exquisite camera work, the seamless editing, and flawless acting. If it hadn't been for David Lean's 'The Bridge on the River Kwai', it would surely have cleaned up the Oscars: it was left to several foreign and non-Hollywood organizations to heap praise on it.Was it because it was in black and white that modern film makers think the modern audience wouldn't bother to watch it and so they contemporize it? It is not that Friedkin's remake is bad but it hasn't quite got it when compared with the original. Great directors sometimes recognize that black and white can give good effect: The Wizard of Oz and The Secret Garden's switch from black and white to color; and the shocking Schindler's List with its little girl in red. The use of black and white in this case adds to the claustrophobic effect in the cramped and hot jury room of this old municipal building.* SOME MINOR SPOILERS *So where else has this production gone wrong? Well, a major irritation is the advanced age of the principle jurors (#3 and #8) considering that the script makes a big play on how old and doddery juror #9 is supposed to be. Joseph Sweeney playing the original character gave a perfect performance of a wily old man, whereas Hume Cronyn's was distinctly bland. Sweeney was 73 where the next oldest was juror #10, played by Ed Begley, at 56. In the modern version the average (mean) age is 56 to the original's 44, and too widely spread to give a convincing microcosm of the good 'ol USA. Just look at some of the ages: Scott (69), Lemon (72), Mueller-Stahl (66), and Davis (80!); in most states of the US this will excuse them service, which is nearly half of this jury. It grates when Scott is told to stop bullying the old man by the patronizing Gandolfini, when it was Scott that looked like he would bust a blood vessel.Certainly, in their younger days, the lead actors would be perfect for the parts they played and I am left thinking that the casting crew were just remembering how they were. Twenty years ago you could believe that Jack Lemon would go out of his way to track down evidence in his own time during the course of the trial (remember the excellent China Syndrome), but here he gave a markedly tired performance. And you can see why they picked 'Old Blood and Guts' Scott as the patronizing bully, who was obviously physically incapable of backing it up. Interestingly, Juror #10 (the racist bigot) was the opposite, he was played here by Mykelti Williamson and was 20 years younger than the brilliant Ed Begley. I think you need a few years under the belt to cut such a deep-seated attitude. You will remember Begley's performance as the communist hating General Midwinter in The Billion Dollar Brain. He was just made for that kind of role, and you 'knew' he believed his ranting diatribe. There was no need for anyone to retort `don't open your filthy mouth again' in the original version as you could see the dawning realization on Begley's face, that he stood utterly alone in his views, crumpling into his seat? Williamson was totally unbelievable mainly because he was part of a culturally diverse jury making it unlikely anyone of his character would risk making such extreme views known; Begley's character was part of an all white jury out to convict the minority Hispanic boy and he thought most of the others shared his assumptions.The small details carefully placed in the original, such as the conspicuously dry E.G Marshall (Mueller-Stahl) showing a bead of sweat when cornered, and the skilled close shots of the reactions of the players gave an atmosphere you could cut through.* END OF MINOR SPOILERS *Besides Scott, who won an Emmy and a Golden Globe award, and Lemon, the other notable performance was from Tony Danza as the bored and indifferent juror #7, who had two tickets to the baseball game burning a whole in his pocket. It was he that got some sort of spark from the Jack Lemon we know from old during one lengthy exchange. In contrast to Lemon, I feel Scott should have been reined in a little, as he was tending to ham it up, especially in the finale.Don't get me wrong, this movie rates an 8, even with the loose directing and surfeit of long shots but it doesn't stand a chance against the original by Sidney Lumet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen both the original 1957 version and the new made-for-TV movie. Here's why I consider the original to still be the best.The 1957 version is packed with extremely talented actors who actually convince the viewer that they are indeed the character they portray. The 1997 version falls far short of this theatrical ideal. George C. Scott and Jack Lemmon seem to have just shown up to read their lines and collect their pay, while Mykelti Williamson chews up the scenery. I've seen more convincing actors in community playhouse production.On the plus side, the 1997 version ditches the all-white-male jury for one that is made up of men of different ages, colors and ethnic backgrounds. This makes it possible for new dynamics to be explored, including the ways that people are different, and similar.If you are looking for an okay movie, try the '97 version. Looking for a great movie? Stick to the '57 original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was amazed at how much I enjoyed this movie, in spite of its simplicity. Without flashbacks, special effects, or music, I felt like I was part of the cast, deciding the destiny of the accused. The judge asked the jury to decide the case beyond a reasonable doubt. `Reasonable doubt! That's nothing but words.' -Juror #3 Yes, but truth is important for life. it must be the basis of justice. It made me hope I never get called to serve on jury duty. but if I do, that I might have the genuine compassion to do the right thing and not just the expedient thing.

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this all-star-cast movie feast. The plot is nothing short of brilliant, and I can understand why someone would want to shoot a remake of a film with such a good script as this. I have not seen the original and can therefore unfortunately not say how they compare, and the script seems like something that might have started out as a stage play, for which it would also work brilliantly.The idea of a film including only the discussion between jurors of a small and seemingly insignificant trial, might seem a boring one at first glance. But, no, this turns out to be a film spanning the foundations of justice, and browsing on important subjects of prejudice due to race and age, as well as containing a critique of a society where impatience has become all too common, and the life of a single person as well as the conscience of all hangs in the balance.I'd recommend this film for its brilliant cast and acting alone, but it has a story that really grips you, and you cannot watch this for long without starting to feel you are also there in that room, a part of the discussion, and not just watching a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is possibly the most watchable crime film of all time. It is quite difficult to separate it from the 1957 original, though it is set more to a 1990's audience, in terms of social thought, and mannerisms.Jack Lemmon, and George C. Scott excel in this tele-movie, as two men of principle, both acting on there instincts and trying to arrive at the correct verdict, for a young man on trial for murder. We dont see the actual trial, the murder, or the lawyers, we instead have to rely on the discussions of the jurors to get an understanding of the events.I dont know of many movies where you are kept on the edge of your seat for the entire film, but this is one of them. The remarkable fact is that the movie is limited to just one room, and virtually no props or special effects. Whether you have seen the original or not, this film will not disappoint. With a supporting cast of Armin Mueller Stahl, and Edward James Almos, this movie has no real weak points.</fullReview>

But the lessons learnt from the original may fade for younger viewers because of racism and sexism. The multi-cultural cast and the use of a female judge is great. The storyline is very true to the original which shows respect for a great movie and the only real need to remake this classic is due to the changing times, so hopefully the younger generation can watch and learn as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch the original if you haven't already</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Admittedly, I went into this one with a strong predilection for the 1957 classic as it is one of my favorite films which I can easily watch over and over. So it was very hard for me not to continually compare the two films, the casting choices, the performances, the oh-so familiar dialogue, against their earlier counterparts. Perhaps, had the original not been so burned into my brain, I might have enjoyed this version more but, as it was, I found that it didn't draw me in or move me in the least and it wasn't just a question of being so used to, and enjoying, the original so much. I've seen a number of versions of "The Christmas Carol," for instance, and there are several I enjoy tremendously, including, ironically, the version with George C. Scott.So I guess I'll start with Scott's performance because, as it were, one of the things that blew me away in the original was his counterpart, Lee J. Cobb's, performance. Juror #3's intensity, sadistic tendencies, blustering mingled with the "just the facts" attitude, yelling and threatening were gloriously and utterly believably played out by Cobb. Cobb *was* Juror #3. Take those same qualities and hand them to a 70-something year old actor who is obviously in declining health and you get mostly words without the passion to back them up. Plus, as others mentioned, the dialog and actions required of this character seemed out-of-place and, sometimes, outright pathetic coming from an old man. Threatening to kill Davis only to be restrained by several(?) men younger than himself, talking disrespectfully to McCardle only to be threatened by much younger and beefier James Gandolfini would have been laughable if the whole thing hadn't been painful to watch. Ironically, this would have been a great role for George C. Scott in his 40s or 50s.As in the original, a number of the characters had so little to do or say that I found it didn't matter to me in the slightest who the actors in this version were and since most of them were now being played by African-Americans, it seemed more like tokenism than anything else. Oh yeah, and an opportunity to insert the word "brother" into Mykelti Williamson's dialogue. In the original, Martin Balsam, Edward Binns, and John Fiedler had very little to do and Jack Klugman fared only a little better. In this version, their counterparts, respectively, Courtney B. Vance, James Gandolfini, Ossie Davis (was he trying to channel John Fiedler's nebbish demeanor??) and Dorian Harewood could have easily been played by other actors (or even actresses, had the movie been called "Twelve Angry Men and Women"). Likewise, Robert Webber was practically a non-entity in the original and William L. Petersen fared the same. If the racial and age diversity of this cast was meant to be politically correct or reflective of society, it would have been better served in a film which used that diversity to full advantage and, in cases like Scott's and, to a lesser degree, Jack Lemmon's (whose Davis seemed bored and tired half the time compared to Henry Fonda's deeply compassionate and thoughtful portrayal), one wishes, as I mentioned earlier, that these actors had been about 20 years younger. As for the others, Edward James Olmos was adequate, Hume Cronyn &amp; Armin Mueller-Stahl were good, Tony Danza was...well I won't go there. Obviously the character of Juror #10 was the most altered, from an old white man (Ed Begley) to a younger, angrier, African-American Muslim (Mykelti Williamson). One of the things that I enjoyed about the ending of the 1957 film was that many of the characters emerged at the end seemingly a little bit wiser (and maybe sadder) from the experience. Begley's character, after the scene where they all turn away from him, seemed utterly stunned at the reaction to him from the others and sat with a look that indicated that maybe he had just gotten a glimmer of understanding about his prejudices. In this film, they chose to portray the character in a more defiant and unrepentant way. More realistic of today's society? Who knows? I just found it one more disappointment about the film.Oh yes...how can I forget, the token female? Look, a lady judge! It must be the 1990s!If you haven't seen the 1957 version, I strongly recommend it over this version. Strong performances by, first and foremost, Lee J. Cobb, followed by Henry Fonda, Ed Begley, E.G. Marshall and Jack Warden, buoyed by able and believable performances by Jack Klugman, Ed Binns, George Voskovec and Joseph Sweeney make you totally believe in their characters. Granted, there are very few non-whites (save for a European(?) Voskovec &amp; the Hispanic defendant) and no females but a good story performed by actors who seem to become their roles is a joy to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching 12 Angry Men on Court TV. Watching this incredible cast was a joy. Not a lemon in the bunch. I especially enjoyed watching William Peterson go against type and play a relatively bumbling character with no confidence. Kudos to him for taking the part.*** Spoilers of a sort from here****However, a couple of things gnawed at me throught the movie. They both revolved around things not discussed, evidence and race. As far as evidence, two things seemed to be ignored by the screenwriter. First, no one seemed to catch on to the fact that according to the witnesses, the perpetrator ran out of the apartment as soon as the body hit the floor, yet the perpetrator also took time to clean the weapon flawlessly. Well, which one is it. Then, and this one bothered me even more, there was no mention of blood on the boy's clothes. If he was the perpetrator of a stabbing with a stilleto knife, with multiple strikes going down, there would be a lot of blood. There was no mention of blood on the boy's clothes when he got back from the movies, and he supposedly left too quickly to change, and no bloody clothes were found.Next was how an issue that I thought might be presented by a juror, especially a black juror, but was not. And that is the distrust of the evidence based on the distrust of authority. The muslim said he did not trust the shrink, but no one questioned the collection of the facts by who collected them or presented them. Having lived in New York City for over a decade and having served on a number of juries here, that is a feeling that more than one in 12 possesses, and that I thought would be presented here. I think the fact that this is a remake of an older movie is the reason for this. A script like this written today would have to deal with that issue, with all of the talk of racial profiling (I know Chicago is dealing with this now, and that the frustration of this and other justice related issues have obviously been on the minds of many in Chicago, especially the south side, since long before this 1997 movie) and the high amount of lawsuits against cities for police harassment. It didn't come up, and to me, that seemed false. I don't mean to offend anyone by this paragraph, I'm sure others will disagree with me, but that was my perception.But thanks to this altogether stellar cast, mainly I just enjoyed the powers of twelve fine actors stuck in one room for two hours with no quick cuts, car chases, needless love stories, digitization, etc...

		<fullReview>12 Angry Men (William Friedkin, 1997)Friedkin's made-for-television adaptation of the classic 1957 film is surprisingly well-thought-out and executed with a style most straight-to-small-screen works lack. Jack Lemmon and George C. Scott presage their conflicts in the later made-for-TV remake Inherit the Wind as the two jurors who refuse to budge from their convictions that a murder case does and does not have reasonable doubt attached to it, respectively.As with the original, 12 Angry Men is really an ensemble piece, the first American example of avant-garde filmmaking on a mass scale; with the exception of a few brief flashes at beginning and end, the film takes place in two adjoining rooms, a jury room and a men's room, allowing the director no scenic latitude at all and forcing him to concentrate on the actors themselves. Friedkin, as Lumet before him, gathers a mix of the well-known and the underrated from all corners of the Hollywood backlot, gives each a speech, and goes to great pains to ensure that those who espouse even the most controversial views are as charismatic as those who are warmer and fuzzier. In other words, this is an actors' movie, pure and simple, and if you enjoy watching actors do what they do, you'll get a kick out of this. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This might give a little more info than you want to know if you have never watched the movie.In watching the movie Twelve Angry Men directed by William Friedkin you see the way a jury should work, but not always does. This was a great movie. It was a movie that showed how the justice system was meant to work. I enjoyed the interesting way it revealed what happened to put the defendant in the position that he is in. I especially enjoyed the way Jack Lemmon (Mr. Davis) stood up for himself and didn't let any of the other jurors perused him to make the wrong decision. He in turn persuaded each and everyone of the jurors to sit down and really think about the evidence presented to them in the trial, and then make the decision on whether they thought that there was any doubt in their mind whether or not the defendant did the murder. The only thing that really saved Mr. Davis in the jury room was the fact that he said that yes, the defendant might have done it, but there was to much reasonable doubt to convict him on it. I believe the tempers would have flared even more than they did Had Mr. Davis not gone the route he did in convincing them. Though everyone was anxious to get out of the jury room for their own reasons I think the time was well spent, especially because it depended upon a man's innocence. The movies ending was the bow on the present.</fullReview>

Changing the Ed Begley part into a black racist, just doesn't work. And neither does casting George C. Scott in the Lee J. Cobb role. Great actor though he was, he was just too old for the part. One plus is that the script is a little softer, and somehow seems a little more acceptable than the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly wonderful psychological drama, with conflicts and battles between extremely well-described personae.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The entire movie revolves around one single jury chamber, with 12 jurors assembling there. At first, the decision seems obvious, and the point of the film is missed. But one juror has to break the immediate blitzkrieg: and it's eleven jurors - GUILTY, versus one - NOT GUILTY. It is this courage and strength of this single juror to change the opinion of all the jury, it is his personal charm and sense of penetration, with a fully convincing tone, that leads the film. Several severe societal conflicts are revealed, and the character of every juror is psychologically and personally enlightened. The jurors hold their own personal investigation, if it might be formulated that way, inside that single chamber. It is amazing how facts are manipulated with practically no physical evidence whatsoever. It is a truly brilliant psychological drama of characters, a drama of powerful personae, and a true battle for justice. No words can describe the tension that silently fluctuates in that room; the struggle of spirits who first see and meet each other; and, for the totally imbalancing strike, we do not even know the jurors' names. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>yet another comparison with the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's pretty hard not to be pre-disposed against a remake of such a classic movie as Sidney Lumet's "12 Angry Men". The recent obsession with taking something which defies improvement, be it an old movie, or (more defensibly, I guess), a foreign language movie and remaking it with lesser stars and a lesser director is always going to be pretty questionable. This one at least goes beyond the at-best workmanlike reinterpretations we're used to. The various actors are all pretty much the equals of their forebears, and provide interesting new insights into the characters and (mostly identical) dialogue. Admittedly, in several cases, they largely repeat the earlier performances - most notably Jack Lemmon, whose eyes, delivery and mannerisms mimic Henry Fonda even down to the additional forehead he's showing. It's pretty understandable, though - the vein of strength, decency and humanity mined by Fonda is perhaps the single most important element in the success of the original. It takes an actor of Lemmon's class to be able to achieve the same quality.The strongest points about the remake when set against the original are Friedkin's direction - starkly different from Lumet's, although not nearly so ground-breaking - and the Mykelti Williamson character. I'm not really in a position to say whether or not he's stereotyped, but the fact that he does not change his opinion, rather, gives up on the other jurors, is a nice and very plausible touch.The big problem with the movie, and it's a trap into which many updates are liable to fall, is that the story belongs to the time in which it was conceived. Another reviewer has attacked the plausibility of the jury's attitude to witnesses, and this is part of my point. The original was written at a time when the justice system was far more widely respected than it is now, a time when racism was an institutional phenomenon (incidentally, where were the women in the remake? I guess the title wouldn't really have worked...). Lumet's film caused people gently to question the system in which it was set, while at the same time reaffirming a belief in common humanity. It assumed a certain naivety - people could be coaxed around their prejudice, the justice system worked for the individual (the revelation of the original was that it was possible for it to fail in its duties). It demonstrated that rights needed to be constantly re-affirmed if society is to achieve its potential. Maybe we need the remake to shake us out of our cynicism, to remind us that there is a way that things ought to be. The thing is, we live in an age in which the rights of the individual have been affirmed to their limits, where racism is not a revelation, where the justice system is mired by a workload it can't handle and a population no longer naive to the power of their rights against it, where the crime rate has spiralled, fundamentally altered by the growth of the drugs industry. The reason that the refusal of the Williamson character to change his opinion is so convincing is because modern prejudice is far more used to being argued against than it was in the 1950s. Not wishing to sound too apocalyptic here, but 90s prejudices are rather like 90s bacteria - mutated to be resistant to the antibiotic of liberal rights. The racism of 1957, insidious and unpleasant in its acceptability, was, in the case of the jurors of the original, sufficiently naive that it could be swayed by the power of liberal reason. Modern prejudice is far more adept at distorting the rhetoric of liberal rights to its own ends. If you've never done so, read the Bonfire of the Vanities, and then ask whether or not a New York courthouse could operate like this in the modern era. Whatever your views on his political attitudes (and, for all the cynicism I've shown here, I'm considerably more optimistic), Tom Wolfe's journalism is reliable.Anyway, for anybody who's still reading, the 12 Angry Men remake is a pretty good movie, almost as good as the original, but without any of the original's relevance, message or plausibility.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>powerful performances, weak ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men has many unique and powerful performances, including sparkling, angry dissertations by the late (and great) George C. Scott and Mikelti Williamson as the black racist juror. However, the ending is anything but satisfying. Without revealing the details, I will say that it hinges on the assumption of a witness's ability to properly perform their function as an eye witness to the crime. Any competent jury in America would be whip-lashed for basing a verdict on this silly presumption. "Beyond a reasonable doubt" is one thing -- what these jurors end up doing is not only preposterous, but more importantly, an unfair portrayal of the American legal system.My recommendation - forget the original; they should have made this version unforgettable. Too bad they didn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that I've never seen the original 1957 movie and so I don't know how this remake compares to it, but I'm sure it did it proud. 12 Angry Men is a movie that is completely built off the acting of it's characters, because there is no action, no graphics, just dialogue and plot. 12 jurors have to decide on the outcome of the trial of a young boy who is accused of stabbing his own father. 11 of the jurors are convinced that he is guilty, while 1 of the jurors (Jack Lemmon) isn't sure that he is guilty and refuses to vote guilty because of his uncertainty. Basically, this is a story that screams out for the need of justice in U.S., the way it was meant to be. Coming after the O.J. Trial, this is a great example of what's wrong with the justice system today. Jack Lemmon is the liberalistic juror who takes a stand against the other 11 jurists and tries to make them realize that they can't be certain that the boy is guilty. While there are 12 jurors, basically the story revolves around 3 men and there completely different viewpoints. Lemmon's main opponent is George C. Scott who is a flaming conservative from the 19th Century. Scott is always great as the convincing, "down to Earth" type who believes in quick and ground breaking actions. Due to experiences with his own lost son, he feels it to be his duty to make sure this kid pays. The 3rd view in this film is portrayed by Mykelti Williamson as the "Black Panther-type" African-American who still is convinced that the "White Man" is out to destroy his race. Williamson deserved an Academy nomination as "Bubba" in Forest Gump and continues to be the most underrated black actor in Hollywood. Williamson does an excellent job with his loud and radical violent views and not only scares the other jurors, but shocks the viewer too. Not to take anything away from the other jurors. The casting for this movie is great and includes many familiar actors like Tony Danza, Edward James Olmos, Courtney B. Vance, and Hume Cronyn along others. A great plot, a great cast, and a great flow of debating issues makes this a damn good movie for those who love intellectual thrillers. Due to it being a remake, I can't give it anything for originality and intellectual thrillers aren't exactly eye-openers or nonstop excitement, so I gave the movie an 8 ot of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is indeed an odious activity, still I could not help but compare this version with the 1957 Sidney Lumet version.And I was awarded with a production which came handsomely into it's own. The twelve actors brought a freshness and an integrity to the play and which did not for a moment make me pause and think that Jack Warden was more of a sport lout than Tony Danza (but who can forget Jack shooting the ball of paper at the fan), or that Lee J Cobb played the bully better than George C Scott, Robert Webber a slicker ad-man than William Petersen. Casting Mikelty Williamson as a bigot where Ed Begley personified the traditional white bigot, was sheer genius.Although I knew the way the plot would unfold, I was still spellbound by the march of reason. As a South African, I have had to live with prejudice, bigotry and discrimination all my life (and the end is not in sight - they now have a different colour) and in the play the dogged endurance of sweet reason can only awaken poor old hope.Sidney Lumet's reading possibly had the edge in leanness. There was the smooth, seamless cut from where the jurors leave the court room to where we see them in the jury room. Why did Friedkin have to flesh out the role of the guard? I'm glad Davis and McCardle did not exchange cell phone numbers.But, a memorable moment in film and I will view it again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set almost entirely in a Jury's deliberation room, this is an incredibly realistic movie about 12 men assigned the task of deciding the fate of another. They seem to have it all figured out, until Jack Lemmon dissents, and one-by-one, like Lemmings, 11 people become convinced that perhaps they are not looking at all the facts.The lack of a soundtrack in this movie impressively adds to the feel. One can almost hear the tension building as Juror #8 points out flaws in every other juror's logic.You will come away from this movie feeling a bit deflated, as you realize how one's personal prejudices, family history, and even tickets to a "Big Game" can play a role in the deliberation process. You will, however, be more than satisfied with the excellent, powerful acting, superb writing and great directing in this movie.I've not seen the original 1957 version with Henry Fonda, but I certainly intend to at first opportunity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is that type of film drama enthuthiasts die for. Set in a hot, muggy jury-deliberation room, twelve chosen men convene to decide one man's fate. Initially, all but one vote for guilty. It takes Lemmon's character (in another of his fine performances--how does he do it?) to gradually change their minds. The ending is half predictable, but the acting throughout, the sheer drama, is utterly satisfying.As I said there is nothing finer about this movie than its acting; if you want to see what acting is all about, see this film. Lemmon, Danza, Scott (remember him in Patton?), and Williamson (as the black racist who eventually "gives up" on the other men) turn in dazzling performances. The sizzling chemistry amongst these men is so real, so penetrating, that we begin to actually feel like one of these 12 men.There are no eye-popping effects (doesn't the movie industry ever get tired of them), no award-winning score, hell, we don't even see what the defendant has done. What we have, to put it bluntly, some damn good acting At the end, after a long time at point A, we arrive at point B happy, satisfied, and, like the city struck by a summer thunderstorm (the rain outside becomes tantamount to the raging tempest inside) midway the deliberations, soaked with fine performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This show is drama at its best. Without all the glitter, the special effects, or the make-up and costumes, it has to be; there's nothing to hide it or cover it over. Although this show pales beside the original, it is still extremely powerful and well-done. The timing was a little too slow and dragged at times, but the plot and dialog still grip as strongly as in the original. I was impressed with the updates to bring the show into the 90's from the original 50's. The writers and actors also managed to fix some of the minutae type problems that plagued the original (places where either the emotions or acting didn't quite match the text or dialog, or places where the idea wasn't clear and took a while to understand). However, as the original is arguably one of the best movies of all time, it is understandable that it would be hard to measure up to it. Still, this remake is a strong and moving piece. Definitely still a good movie, just not amongst the best of all time as the original was. Very different from the original and I recommend that anyone who likes the show should see both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this one with an open mind after seeing the original a few times. I wanted to like it. I really did. But........This movie did nothing for me. It was OK, just because the story is a very interesting story. I admire all of the actors in this movie...even Tony Danza to some degree. But the modernization of the original costs the movie valuable atmosphere points, which was what made the earlier version one of the best movies I've ever seen.In the original, you couldn't help but feel the heat of the room, the rising anger, and ever-increasing claustrophobic state. A few director's "tricks" helped with that. I felt no heat and claustrophobia in this one...and the anger felt more forced.I agree with the reviewers who stated that it was not a good idea to have older actors in so many roles, including Lemmon, Scott, and Davis. It ruins the storyline around the age of Juror #9, and doesn't allow Scott to be as forceful as Cobb was in the original. And Scott does not do nearly as good a job with his end of movie rant as Cobb did. I was totally unmoved, though I must admit while watching the remake that all I could think about was Cobb's masterful gut-wrenching speech. That's not to say that the acting wasn't good. It just wasn't great.Other little things that annoyed me (ONE SPOILER):Gandolfini was vastly underused.Juror #10 never realizes his idiotic behavior, so it's totally unbelievable that he would change his vote for no reason.We see a totally unnecessary and overly dramatic speech by the judge at the beginning of the movie.We also see a shot of the defendant, which takes away from the imagination factor of the original.I give this movie a rating of 5/10. If it were an original and not a remake, I'd give it 7/10 for the story alone. I gave the actual original movie (albeit a remake of a play) a 10/10. See the original and forget this one.</fullReview>

It certainly has great merit.It is in the comparisons to be drawn against the earlier masterpiece that the thing unravels. Both Lemmon and Scott were too old for their respective parts - no question. Scott in particular and hey, we are speaking here of pretty much my favorite actor. They are both good, but Fonda and Cobb they 'aint! Don't even THINK about comparing them! As one reviewer accurately surmised, George C Scott in his forties would have really given this role a shake. He may well have topped even Cobb's performance.The remaining jurors, including now some politically correct afro-american content, do not improve on or even match-up to the original personalities. Inarguably a terrific effort from Friedkin and co, my question is simply "why did they bother?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake as powerful and compelling as the original film with Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb, the 1997 made for cable version directed by William Friedkin is a superb production. I had felt remakes of classic films to be an unpleasant experience and less than satisfactory. However, this contemporary production featuring Jack Lemmon, George C. Scott, Ossie Davis, Hume Cronin, Armund Mueller-Stahl, Courtney B. Vance, Dorian Harwood and Tony Danza, brings the notion of ensemble acting to the level of fine art. This is a production that updates the superior original film with its all white cast to the present with mixed race actors, each of whom shades the interpretation of their dialogue as members of the multitude of ethnicities, nationalities, creeds, ages, and ideologies that comprise modern American society.In finely tuned performances which brings vitality to the story of men locked in life-altering judgement of a young man accused of patricide, the cast performs with give and take of mature actors, each of whom is capable of holding the screen individually. Director Friedkin moves his camera about the small room and foregoes the dramatic closeups of the previous Lumet version which allows the actors to use their entire bodies to threaten, cajole, harass, or implore other jurors as each man argues for a guilty or innocent judgement. While the original film is worthy of all praise, Friedkin has created a film equal to the original, if not better. If nothing, the film is a joy for the performances of the late Scott and Lemon. Overbearing or subtle, their binary oppositional positions in the jury room are a dramatic ballet by great actors giving outstanding performances that we can savor and mourn for having lost them far too early. Twelve Angry Men is a superior remake of an outstanding original film. A keeper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many films these days rely on special effects and action sequences to relay the story, the power of fine acting gets lost. I have never seen the original film, so, all of my views are strictly of the remake that aired, I believe, on Showtime.The scene is absolutely miserable, one small room on a hot day and no air conditioning. A half dozen bullheaded opinions and one simple decision: Guilty or not guilty?The biggest surprise in this film could be Tony Danza, who finally got away from the 'Yo, Tony' roles. He's a real hardcase here and quite self centered. Somehow, though, he is the balance of the men in the room. At the extreme epitome of arrogance sit George C. Scott and Mykelti Williamson. On the opposite end, in one of his finest roles: Jack Lemmon and Hume Cronyn.I liked that this film allowed elderly men to be brilliant. In addition to Jack Lemmon &amp; Hume Cronyn, Armin Mueller-Stahl is immaculate and sharp as a tack. In fact, the cast is perfect. Not one change could have been made. Some of the finest actors working today sit in this room! A pre-Sopranos James Gandolfini, a pre-CSI William Petersen ... Edward James Olmos, Courtney B. Vance, Dorian Harewood. All of them are spectacular.If you like smart movies, you will love this!</fullReview>

When I saw this movie when it came out on Showtime in 97, I fell in love with it.This movie has one of the greatest casts of any movie I have ever seen. I never, never liked Tony Danza, but he does a good job here. But look at the rest of the cast: Ossie Davis, Jack Lemon, Courtney Vance, James Gandolphini (before he was known as Tony Soprano), Edward James Olmos, and George C. Scott.The screenplay is based on the original movie, but I can't really picture this movie without the racial tension. Half the jury is black, so there is ocassional rascial tension between them. I love Ossie Davis, and I really cannot picture this movie without him.You must respect the task the director was up against when making this movie. The entire movie (with the exception of the VERY ending and the VERY begginning) is filmed in two rooms: the jury room and the men's room. the director's only action to work with is the actors, which makes this more like a play than a film. But the tension and suspense that is created within the single jury room is more than most high budget suspense-thillers I see today.I really reccomend this movie to people who haven't seen the original and to those who have. This interpritaion is, in my view, better because of its great cast and it's new suspense scenes. I know I have only seen pieces of the original, but I still think this is superior.9/10</fullReview>

Jack Lemmon is brilliant as the knight and warrior of righteousness and gives his character Davies the exact expressiveness and life that is needed - a bit more than Fonda who was a bit more silent and concerned as a person. Nothing wrong about him - Lemmon does however make his man stronger with a touch of a temper - he can get a little angry an it looks good. It's the best!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TV remake compares well with 1957 film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version, like the 1957 film, both based on a play, shows by means of a fictitious jury deliberation how any juror's interpretation of evidence might be influenced by his own personal problems and prejudices. It also shows how "direct evidence", apparently unassailable, may in fact be very fallible and misleading. In the end, and initial vote to 11 to 1 for "guilty", became 12 to 1 for "not guilty". Mostly this came about by means of the patient hammering away at the "open and shut" case against the defendant, by one juror, to show that the evidence against the defendant was in fact open to considerable "reasonable doubt". We, at the end, don't know absolutely whether the Puerto Rican immigrant boy killed his father or not. All we do know is that the evidence is far from overwhelming, as it seemed at the beginning. The excellent cast, under sure handed direction, runs quite a gamut of emotional outbursts before the verdict is reached. TV movies are not often this good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>12 Incredible Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember being a little kid, watching the original version of 12 Angry Men on TV thinking this is one of the best movies I'd ever seen.Then I heard they were re-making it for TV and I thought, "no way, the magic of this movie just can't be replicated."Of course it couldn't. Friedkin didn't even try, instead creating a different backdrop to the same story. It works incredibly well on every level and, of course, it doesn't hurt matters to have such an incredible cast at your disposal.Honestly, Lee J Cobb/Henry Fonda OR George C Scott/Jack Lemmon? How could you possibly decide which of the two pairings is better? Both of them are perfect.But, since we're on the subject of the second film, let's talk about Scott and Lemmon some more. They explode off the screen. Scott is one of my all-time favorite actors, yet throughout the course of this movie I continue to find myself physically hating him. I hate the man. THAT'S HOW GOOD HE IS. But, ultimately, juror #3 is exposed as a sad man who bears a heavy burden from the past.The wonder of this movie is that not only does it manage to show such suspense and tear-jerking action within the confines of one jury room, but also that it shows so incredibly many facets. I mean, there's 12 jurors in that room and every single one of them's got a story to tell. This is perhaps one of the richest storylines I've ever seen in my life.Add to that the fact that this movie featured Tony Danza in an unforgettable role and you've got exactly what the poor kid on trial got: A wonderful jury!This movie gets my award for the greatest re-make of all time. Bar none. Without blinking an eye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not everything is black and white.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing in this remake surpasses or improves on the original 1957 film, which makes the whole enterprise rather pointless. Reginald Rose has tweaked here and there with his original teleplay, comtemporizing the trial and the twelve angry men, but, ultimately it's the same movie...in colour.That said, it isn't a bad film, and is thoroughly watchable, with some fine performances and sparking dialogue. But you'd be just as well to watch Lumet's version, which has the benefits of even finer performances and electrifying verbal confrontations. Lemmon doesn't match up to Fonda as 'Juror #8', and appears too smug in parts, especially when baiting Scott's 'Juror #3'. Otherwise all the parts are filled out competently. Possibly the only interest over the original is the inclusion of a more ethnically diverse jury, which is an interesting development, but one which only serves to make the picture more relevant to those viewers who don't like to watch anything in black and white. There are many opportunities to take the narrative down different routes, offering new challenges for the jury and the viewer, but none were taken. A rewrite would've certainly been more welcome than this slightly updated remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Jury Duty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some big names work together to make a decent update of the original 1957 film version. High marks to all involved for fairly solid acting and being able to keep in interesting while the film takes place in virtually one room. Not too bad for a made-for-TV flick.The film is about a jury of 12 men who must decide to pass judgment on the guilt or innocence of a man when all the evidence seems to go against him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this remake of the 1957 classic is actually pretty good.it doesn't have the same impact or resonance of the original,but it is good int it's own right.just like in the original,there are some fine actors here.Courtney B. Vance,William Petersen,Ossie Davis,George C. Scott,Armin Mueller-Stahl(who has never turned in a bad performance,even in a bad movie)and jack Lemmon are just a few of the brilliant performers here.there is only one weak link. and for me,that would be Tony Danza.he just seems out of his league here.although it wasn't necessary to remake the classic version(since there was no way to improve on it)at least they didn't butcher the material.for me,Twelve Angry men is a 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly predictable and one-dimensional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Choosing an intriguing theme does not automatically result in a good movie. Everybody will agree on the social and ethical relevance of pointing out the deficiencies of the jury system. But what do you call a movie which also includes (1) extremely stereo-typed and implausible characters (take a look at the former Nation of Islam member who behaves like he's from Mars), (2) a plot which you can see coming from miles away (surprise: a one-to-eleven vote changes into twelve-to-nil) and (3) a disclosure of 'evidence gaps' which is an insult for the intelligence of the viewer (none of the jurors even considers the option that an eye-witness will not need her *reading glasses* to see a murder at a 10 meters distance). The makers of the movie prove their point in a rather surprising and totally unintended way: if jurors are so one-dimensional, mindless and so easily to be persuaded, re-persuaded, and contra-persuaded as shown in this movie, stay away from court girls and boys! I certainly would not call this a good movie, to use a *heavy* understatement. The exuberant comments this movie received in the Internet Movie Database (which made me rent this movie) are probably Pavlov responses to Quality-Actor-Movies-with-Deep-Messages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the tv movie version of 12 angry men, this first came out 40 years before this one in 1957, starring Jack Klugman and the other actors who i can't remember. This one i really did enjoy, Jack lemmon and George C Scott are fantastic actors. Sadly them 2 died in different years, i give my heart to them. Thank you George and Jack for the fantastic movies and the work you put into them. God Bless you both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So often in this industry, some misguided director attempts a remake of a film that should have been left as-is and winds up with a pale imitation of the film. This was not the case here.Aside from the star power (which helped carry the original), the dialogue (same), and acting talent represented in this movie, the camera work that Friedkin involved was a much more open format, I felt. It allowed for greater flexibility with character blocking, and illustrated just how trapped the men were in the room.All in all, I liked this version a lot better than the original, though the original is great, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men (1997) ** 1/2 (out of 4) By the numbers remake from director William Friedkin tells the same story as the original film. When I say "by the numbers" I really mean it because for some reason this film uses the same story and dialogue from the first film, which really makes no sense but the film is somewhat entertaining even though we've seen it all before. The all-star cast includes Jack Lemmon, George C. Scott, Tony Danza, Ossie Davis, James Gandolfini and Edward James Olmos. The one interesting change is that four black jurors were added and the way Friedkin uses this is rather interesting in some dialogue about race.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie sucked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll give you two words why this movie sucked TONY DANZA!!!! Who told this idiot he was funny or could act? He's terrible! I almost had a stroke when he was considered replacing John Ritter on 8 Simple Rules. I watched "Man in the Moon" a couple of weeks ago. The movie about Andy Kaufman. Everybody BUT him showed up to do scenes that took place on the Taxi set. What? too busy or good to hang around the other cast members. If Marilu Henner has the time, you sure the hell do. As for his boxing career? I'd kick his little ass. And anyone who hang around Judith Light must suck. I think they had a competition on who could make the worst movies/shows. That's a big toss up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading all the glowing praise about this remake of 12 ANGRY MEN I sat down hoping to see a reinterpretation of a classic film , but it`s more or less the same script filmed in colour with a different cast . No doubt one way of looking at it is that the original Reginald Rose script hasn`t been destroyed by radical rewriting but like the remakes of THE GETAWAY and PSYCHO it seems a waste of time making something that`s almost the exact same as the original shot for shot . The producers do deserve some credit for making the rabid reactionary racist a black muslim thereby saving the viewer from some patronizing PC garbage but at the end of the day the original movie didn`t need remaking and this TVM proves it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen the classic 1950's version of this movie, but I seriously doubt that I would enjoy it any more than this brilliant remake. To put it mildly, this film has some of the best acting that I will ever see. The whole cast is great, but George C. Scott and Jack Lemmon really stand out in a film where all the performances are rock solid. The absorbing story moves along at a relatively brisk pace, and I was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. I can't praise this film enough. Even if you love the original, this is still a must-see.</fullReview>
