		<shortDescription>a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best silent dramas I've seen. As dark and shadowy as anything the German Expressionists produced, but featuring performances that were quite understated and naturalistic for the day. No camera mugging and no unintentional laughs due to wild-eyed arm-waving histrionics. Sjostrom gave a convincing performance as the drunken, mean-spirited and frightening David Holm.Set mostly at night in a dingy Swedish slum, the film had a very claustrophobic set-bound feel to it, aided by the low key lighting and extensive use of irising.There was a deep, and typically Scandinavian, sense of despair and hopelessness to the narrative: the film begins in a rather grim present, and then we're told David Holm's story in a series of flashbacks (and flashbacks within flashbacks--a pretty complex story structure for 1921), where his character is offered numerous chances at redemption, but he doesn't take them, and we know he won't take them, because we've seen him die drunk and wretched and mean as ever in the present. The penultimate scene is as dark as any I have seen in all of cinema.The writing and directing is tight and intelligent, even by today's standards. In several instances, Sjostrom skillfully sets the audience up to suspect one thing, and then pulls out a surprise. The ending might not be such a surprise to some viewers, but I didn't see it coming.This movie deserves a full restoration and DVD release. Or even a crappy budget release. It just needs to be out there so people can see and appreciate it.9.5/10, which rounds up to 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a masterpiece to put it simply. Especially the double exposure made by the cameraman Julius Jaenzon. It is skillfully made even with the standards we are used to today seventy eight years later. Viktor Sjöström, the director, also plays the main character, David Holm. On the night of new years eve he is killed in a fight, and the legend says that the first one who dies on the new year, will have to work as a soul-collector in the form of a transparent ghost. There is a new soul-collector to be appointed every year.The scene in which the alcoholic, David Holm, rises up from his dead body (like the soul is leaving his earthly body) in the churchyard (where the fight took place) is a real award for a filmloving eye. Also when the present soul-collector arrives with his horse and carriage is a beautiful but also a scary scene. David Holm recognizes this soul-collector as a drinkingfriend from earlier life. It is now his turn to take over. Just like Scrooge in Dickens story "A christmas tale", David is shown what his life and doings has led to for the people around him.The film is about the danger of abusing drugs, in this case alcohol. It is based upon a book by Nobel prize winner Selma Lagerlöf. Viktor Sjöström filmed a few more of her books, but this is the one with the best outcome, maybe because this book is the most filmic of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best silent movie I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best silent movie I've ever seen. It's so harrowing and perfectly describes the feelings I've had about death, life, love and especially hope. It's optimistic ending makes it even stronger. I cried when I saw this movie the first time, which was the day after my grandfather's death.He once told me this was the first movie he ever saw, in a cinema, to which there was a 10 kilometers walk in the snow. The cinema used to be so crowded the humidity got so high the walls were completely wet. Naturally I had a lot in mind that day. It wasn't the first time I saw the movie, but the first time I experienced it's meaning completely. I've never seen any silent film like this and that it's silent actually makes it scarier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film; KTL soundtrack recommended</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Victor Sjostrom's silent film masterpiece The Phantom Carriage has recently been released on DVD with a new soundtrack recorded by KTL. The duo, comprising American guitarist Stephen O'Malley and Austrian laptop artist Peter Rehberg, has conjured an extraordinary collection of sounds to accompany and accentuate the original film footage from 1921. An ominous banging sound introduces each Act and a medley of drones, guitar chords and feedback ebbs and flows as the grim drama unfolds.As impressive as the new soundtrack is, the film remains the real star with its timeless rendering of a dark and dystopian fairy tale. According to this tale the last person to die before the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve is condemned to spend a year behind the reins of the eponymous phantom carriage, collecting the souls of the dead. This is the fate of the anti-hero of the film, David Holm, who is moved to painful scrutiny of his life following his untimely death and subsequent encounter with the driver of the carriage.This film is often referred to as a horror film and although this is a fitting label, the real horror here resides not in the supernatural elements but rather in the depiction of human suffering at the hands of others. Sjostrom gives a remarkable performance as the drunken, spiteful and menacing Holm in life, and the wretched, frightened Holm looking back from the land of the dead and shrinking from his past deeds.Striking imagery abounds throughout The Phantom Carriage and more than compensates for the inevitably limited dialogue. The ill-omened onset of midnight is powerfully illustrated through the image of a clock-face hovering alone in the darkening night sky like a second moon. Equally impressively, the dead are depicted through pioneering semi-transparent imagery and the scenes of the phantom carriage riding over land and sea remain chilling to watch.Sjostrom's film deserves its place as one of the most esteemed silent films of all time and the new soundtrack by KTL is a superb accentuation of its themes. This is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much said without words.This is an excellent movie. It was made in color-not color as in today's films, but a special mono-color use (with shadings) that portrayed meaning, mood, sense and time. It should be seen in color, as it becomes an entirely different film. The story, by Nobel prize-winner Selma Lagerlöf, is effectively presented. One never has a clear sense of real, memory or phantom. Changes going on in Swedish society at the time are subtly layered. Most highly recommend. Try to rent it or find it on-line. I saw it in a Swedish film class and I want to add it to my film library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They say this carriage "is no ordinary cart" . . . What a colossal understatement!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Victor Sjöström's Körkarlen plunges the viewer into life's lower depths for much of its running time, with grim scenes of alcoholic degradation, family violence and suicidal despair, but the most memorable passages involve the mythic image of Death itself. Here Death is embodied as a ghostly horse-drawn carriage, driven by a miserable sinner who was the last person to die on the previous New Year's Eve. For one year the wretch must collect the souls of the newly departed, and after twelve months of this horrible servitude the driver's own soul is finally released when the last person to die on December 31st becomes the new driver.The scenes involving this carriage (the film was known as "The Phantom Carriage" or "The Phantom Chariot" in English-speaking countries) are eerie and mesmerizing, utilizing double-exposure cinematography that was quite sophisticated for its time and still effective when seen today. Most strikingly, the carriage travels to the floor of the ocean to collect the soul of a person who drowned. As fascinating as these scenes are, however, the bulk of the film is concerned with the downward spiral of David Holm, played by the director himself in an understated portrayal of a man who has given up on the possibility of living a decent life. In flashbacks we see Holm enjoying a pleasant day at the beach with his wife, children and brother, and he appears to be a perfectly ordinary guy. Abruptly, without segue or explanation, we then see Holm as an alcoholic wreck, in trouble with the law and alienated from his family. Ordinarily this leap from Before to After might feel like a story-telling deficiency, but in this case the filmmakers trust us to fill in the familiar, sordid details on our own. It's suggested that Holm has been led astray by his convivial friend Georges, the drinking companion who first relates the tale of the Phantom Carriage, but whatever the cause of his downfall Holm appears to be a lost cause, a mean-spirited drunk who takes perverse pleasure in inflicting pain on his family and in refusing to reform.While David Holm is our central figure the story's true catalyst is a young Salvation Army nurse who takes a sympathetic interest in his case and doggedly believes in him despite his hateful behavior. When the nurse herself is dying-- indirectly due to her ministrations on Holm's behalf --she demands to see him, and thus inadvertently sets in motion a chain of events that will result in his recovery.At times this film resembles Dickens' tale of Scrooge in its use of ghostly visitors who inspire a flawed man to take stock of his life, suffer over his misbehavior, and reform. I was also reminded of Sjöström's 1917 drama Terje Vigen, in which a man returns from jail to find his house empty and his family gone: a sequence echoed here. The director reiterates a standard theme of Scandinavian folklore, found earlier in his Berg-Ejvind och hans hustru (a.k.a. "The Outlaw and His Wife," 1918) that no man can outrun his fate. This time, however, it could be argued that David Holm actually succeeds in evading his seemingly inevitable fate, for he's given an unexpected second chance to make amends.Viewers expecting a a supernatural tale will appreciate the sequences featuring the Phantom Carriage of the title, but may not be prepared for this film's painful examination of a troubled man's alcoholic downfall. But those with a taste for intense and powerful silent drama will appreciate Körkarlen in its entirety. It stands with the best serious cinema of its era and is certainly one of Sjöström's most accomplished works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is perhaps among the best movies ever made. If you rent it or buy it, and take the time to see it you will never regret it. If you are tired of reviews, you can stop reading here....now run along and get it.Based on Nobel laureate Selma Lagerlöfs tale about a carriage driving around on New Years eve, collecting the souls of the dead.The tale is at once a ghost story, a morality and a social statement much like the best of Charles Dickens. The film was made when movies were very young but as with many of those pictures by Lang, Murnau, Wiene and even Stiller, they remain very modern both in language and story. (In those days the best movies were made in Europe; Griffith seems ridiculous compared to this.)The film was made in heaven by a true genius, Victor Sjöström. By the time he started to dabble with pictures he was an actor employed by the Swedish Royal Dramatic Theatre. He not only directed the movie, he played one of the main characters and built the backgrounds when needed. To help him along came camera man Julius Janzon and those two created magic much like Orson Welles and Gregg Toland would do on Citizen Kane, later.If you're not simply captured by the movie, think of this: Janzon double exposed up to x9 to gain the ghost effects; on a hand turned movie camera.For Sjöström, just to prove his genius, he moved to Hollywood to make a few movies including masterful renditions like "He Who Gets Slapped" with Lon Chaney and "The Scarlet letter" with Lilian Gish. Both are masterpieces and if you see these movies you will recognize Sjöströms mark. Some say he left Hollywood, disappointed, after having seen Stiller been treated bad by Hollywood's "industry". Legend or not, he did leave.Ingmar Bergman gave Sjöström a tender and loving exit part; a beautiful homage; in his legendary "Wild Strawberries" from 1957. Sjöström played old professor of medicine, Isaac Borg, traveling through Sweden and at the same time through the memories of his life. Wild Strawberries in turn is another legendary film...but that's another story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The soul's long, hard journey into night (and the mechanisms that produce god)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had I known this was going to turn out as deeply awesome as it did, I would have perhaps saved it for a time of need. I'm always looking for spiritual visions that permit a journey inwards, but they are so few in the grand scheme that I'm grateful for each and every one. I try to cherish them because they let me watch from the heart. It's why I keep myself from finishing off the rest of Tarkovsky's films - I want to know that there's always a drink of fresh water at hand when I'm parching.I came to this, like most people I presume, for its reputation as a horror film where the reaper gets out to harvest souls. I collect these as well but for different reasons, and was expecting here something more or less expressionist. As with most silents however, it's not really horror by our contemporary sense; horror in these films comes from more directly abstract notions, guilt, humiliation, spiritual damnation, and it's usually with the intent to distill a life lesson. They may seem outdated now but only because we presume to know these things and so reckon that no further guidance is necessary - while we, self-sufficient modern humans in perfect control of our destinies, continue to live our lives in random iterations.Here death itself. The journey of the soul in the world inside the soul. Like earlier texts of this journey, Dante's Inferno or the Egyptian Book of the Dead, it is advisable, imperative even, that we read beyond the feverish vision of the beyond. That we read between the collective dream the author has dreamed up as meant to await us and contemplate on why we dreamed in the first place.The man who dies last on New Year's Eve - at the cusp of new life, and so at the start of a new cosmic round - becomes Death's driver for the coming year, this is the premise. He ferries the vehicle - and us as passengers - where the journey inwards or across can begin. Our man contemplates the chain of events that brought him lying dead before the carriage of death.The opening chapters in the Book of the Dead that propel the process of rebirth, and which pertain very much here, are thus named: "The chapter of making Osiris S. possess a memory in the Underworld" and next "the chapter of giving Osiris S. a heart in the Underworld".The man remembers, he had a perfectly good life and family but blew it up like so many we know of. He goes into prison and comes out reborn again with realization of what his deeds brought him. But he has to start again, like every new life he has to build his again from nothing. Instead he drags himself through this next life in a limbo of guilt and seething hatred. It is this unswathing of the spirit across different worlds that matters, and the dissolution in each one granting passage in the next. How strong karmas resonate from one existence to the other, powering the cart. Death's driver is granting the visions after all.There is a woman in all of this, a nurse for the Salvation Army. From her end, she is looking to hear from god. We see from both ends, her trying to save who she considers a mandate from god and on the other side the man who is wrestling personal demons. If god doesn't speak through him, then he never spoke at all. In a beautiful scene, she spends the night mending his torn soul; when he wakes up, furious at the kindness, he tears it up again for spite.More great cinema about the karmas metaphysically weaving together the participants: having failed to mend him, the woman literally contracts his illness. And when the man violently attacks with an axe a locked door, his wife on the other side falls to die.The man finally wakes up from death though, having prayed and thus lay himself prostrate before a higher force. This is likely a part that modern viewers will find hard to swallow. But this is the thing; it is not literal death in these texts, never was. The underworld the soul must travel through to be reborn on the other side is always inside, why it's so often called a 'descent', and so the power to make a full transit by learning again life-value through the different levels always rests with the soul. What the man learns at the moment of prayer is the humility that shatters ego. Of course he is forgiven. One of the final chapters in that ancient Egyptian text reads: "chapter of causing a man to come back upon his house on earth". Notice that the dead man is no longer symbolically referred (and so protected) by the name of the god Osiris, having passed the horrible tribulations, now the deity is embodied inside.So god does speak after all through this man, but it speaks to her who was looking to apprehend him and so, no doubt, will hear his voice in the miracle. From our perspective seeing deeper into these lives, our perspective itself dislocated from bodies and wandering with the spirits, we know there was no god: the miraculous transformation on the visible level was only the last step in a painful, arduous process of healing the heart. It's a powerful notion, worth two or three Seals (Bergman).So it's really only us who can mend ourselves. It's a lesson, make no mistake, but a lesson worth keeping. Simply said, it sounds trite - most anything does if the words are not right. The man was told after all, no doubt he understood in some capacity, but it meant nothing. Which is why it's important to journey from the heart.Something to meditate upon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A FANTASTIC silent film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This, unfortunately, is a little-known film.....i say "unfortunately", because it ranks up there with the "classics" of the American silent screen!It's about a legend of a "phantom chariot" that travells all over the world, picking up the souls of those who have died. The legend says tha the last person to die on New Year's Eve is condemned to drive the chariot for the next whole year.It brings to mind the sequence of the "Ghost of Future Yet To Come" in Dicken's famous "Christmas Carol".The double-exposure effects of the ghosts (esp. when they interact with the "live" people) are EXCELLENT! If you love silent films, you MUST see THIS; it will "blow you away"!Norm VogelNorm's Old Movie Heaven http://www.nvogel.com/film/film.html</fullReview>

		<fullReview>?Lord, let my soul come to maturity before it is reaped?""Strange...unusual..."someone may think...to begin a review on this film with a prayer, more to say, a prayer not to achieve wisdom or intellect but...maturity - something that has hardly been a theme of many top notch productions - something hardly even mentioned as a human merit in the commercial world - yet, something at the core of this film's message.In the period of supermen and thrilling actions, viewer's eyes and perceptions are not used to such reflective dimensions. However, it appears that Victor Sjoestrom's masterpiece, based on the 1912 novel THY SOUL SHALL BEAR WITNESS by the Noble Prize winner Selma Lagerlof finds its most profound gist in that. THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE made almost 90 years ago is a milestone in Swedish cinema and a notable film that has overwhelmed eminent people of the 20th century, including Ingmar Bergman. But, I usually ask myself a question, especially before the meditative time of November, what is it that makes such films stand out as masterpieces. Is it the direction, the cinematography, special effects, narrative structure, or perhaps something less common in an ordinary discussion...? Having watched the restored version with its newly commissioned soundtrack by KTL, I had a feeling that I was watching something unique. Of course, I had heard before how significant it was for the cinema but that did not play a decisive role in my experience. I was mesmerized whilst my own subjective viewing and found this silent pearl captivating. Yes, Sjostrom's film touched me tremendously with its innovative structure of flashbacks (although there are flashbacks within flashbacks, I did not get confused), with its powerful cinematography by Julius Jaenzon, with its flawless direction by the master of Swedish cinema who plays the lead as well. The images that are in this film are really hard to forget, hard to skip. The viewer is, as if, taken to its world, experiences what the characters get through, absorbs oneself to a great extend with what one sees in this silent masterpiece. Everything seems to be balanced and crafted so well, including the movements of the camera, the extensive use of special effects, double exposures in the visualization of the ghost characters who walk in three dimensions, the tension and the performances of the great Swedish cast of the time.It is truly hard to skip the mesmerizing, symbolic, even ICONIC moments of the movie when the driver of the 'strict master' (Death) arrives at various spots, including the sea (intense visual experience), the room of a rich suicide, the streets as well as the graveyard where David (Victor Sjostrom) is to substitute his pal Georges (Tore Svennberg) on that memorable New Year's Eve. The visual feast finds its climax at the moment when David, having visited the dying Edit (Astrid Holm), the member of the Fralsningsarmen (Salvation Army), arrives finally at his home and sees the drama of his wife and children, the drama caused by his monster-like behavior. The visual moment worth high consideration is when David comes back to his home obscene and drunk, is closed in the kitchen by his wife who is afraid of tuberculosis infection and he brutally takes the axe and breaks through the door. The whole drama becomes visually and mentally so powerful that tears are running on the cheeks of a more delicate viewer. However, the greatest maturity of the film is its content so vividly derived from Selma Lagerlof's novel and so creatively executed in this picture...There is everything that human heart can experience: love, disappointment, courage, sympathy, fear, bad influence, fights, suffering, loneliness, sorrow, wretchedness, despair, but finally the glory of reconciliation and tears of joy. There are truly different psychological dimensions, or more to say, mental journeys that the director, with the masterful power of the source novel, invites us to experience. There are elements of gloom, the elements of intensive mysticism; there is a redeeming power of prayer for other people (the plot of Edit) and the gist of penance. While the film seems to touch the very heart of Christianity at certain moments, it also appears to evoke thought provoking feelings about what, in fact, is the most important value in life.The bitter experience of the leading character makes us shocked at first but...in time, indifferent to his feelings. He becomes a villain in our eyes. Although the character of Georges proves to us the consequences of bad influence, we don't see David as a victim (sort of) but as a single human being responsible for himself. We, as viewers, at certain moment, stop feeling empathy with the character but rather concentrate on other people, good people and cry with them. But, at the right moment, we seem to realize his plea to God, his fruitful tears of penance, we seem to forgive him as his wife (Hilga Borgstrom) does forgive him. The human heart appears to shout out from its depths: "Genuine redemptive tears!" What a drama! What a psychological feast! What a movie that evokes such feelings! That is the profoundity of THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE and though that aspect may be considered difficult to capture for some viewers, I think it is an absolute necessity while analyzing this film. Although the movie has become a source of inspiration for many eminent people of cinema, I think that not all of them understood its gist in the right manner. Enthusiastically speaking, it is another silent film that proves the masterful nature of the early cinema and a film that may be seen from different angles. Nevertheless, there is also a danger that we condense its meaning to a sheer scary movie and look through the terrifying moments ignoring the rest. That would be nothing but an unforgivable conjecture. THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE is a story of a joyful gift, of another chance to become mature, a redemptive chance. Masterpiece, 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On a dark, gloomy New Year's Eve night, an ill nurse, her life slowly ebbing away, demands that David Holm be presented to her at once. We don't yet know who David Holm is, or why this nurse wishes to see him, but her only dying wish is to speak with him just one more time. On the other side of the town, nestled comfortably amongst the gravestones of the local cemetery, Holm (Victor Sjöström, who also directed) and two of his drunken associates merrily await the coming of the New Year. "Here we can tell just when to drink the New Year in," exclaims Holm, casting a finger towards the large clock tower that looms through the darkness. Little does he know, however, that he will not be alive to greet it.To pass the time, Holm cheerfully recites a ghost story. He'd once had a friend name George, "a merry fellow" who was "smarter than the rest of us." On one New Year's Eve several years ago, George has broken up a potentially disastrous brawl, fearing that the final man to draw his last breath before midnight would be condemned to drive the phantom chariot for the next year, doing Death's bidding and collecting the souls of the deceased. "And, gentlemen, George died last New Year's Eve!" concludes Holm happily, not bothering to contain his mocking skepticism of the man's beliefs.As fate has it, of course, an unexpected violent encounter results in Holm's death, just on the stroke of midnight. As the man's transparent spirit rises gingerly from his earthly body, he witnesses, to his horror, the distant approach of a phantom carriage. The driver, a frail cloaked figure - a sickle clasped tightly in his hand - steps down from the carriage and approaches. We are astonished to discover that the driver is none other than a decrepit George, preparing to pass on his ghastly duty to this year's successor.Considering the era in which 'Körkarlen' is made, the special effects in this film are absolutely superb. Cinematographer Julius Jaenzon used double-exposure photography to create the eerie, ghostly silhouette of the carriage and its damned driver. Even today, the end result is highly effective. A particularly impressive scene involves the phantom chariot travelling to the ocean floor to retrieve the soul of a drowned man. Another scene, eerily reminiscent of Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) in Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining,' involves Holm breaking down the kitchen door with an axe in order to reach his fleeing wife and children.Genuinely ominous and unsettling in its execution, Victor Sjöström's 'Körkarlen' is a fine work of cinema, successfully portraying Holm's steady alcoholic decline, his inevitable day of judgment, and a final hopeful possibility of redemption.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not as well known as the English, American, German and French cinema, though cinema from Sweden from the '20's was also quite good, interesting and revolutionary.This is a movie that is made great by its story. The story is told in 'A Christmas Carol' kind of way, in which the death himself confronts the deceased with his past, present and what could have been. It's of course a story that concentrates on morals and it does this very well. The message comes across as very powerful and effective. This is of course also definitely due to the effective directing from the father of Swedish cinema; Victor Sjöström.The story is based on the novel by other Swedish author Selma Lagerlöf. The story is adapted by Victor Sjöström himself, who perhaps should had taken out a few more elements, to let the story and movie flow better. It perhaps takes a bit too long before the movie starts to take form and the story gets clear but when the movie does take form and pace it becomes a really wonderful one.The movie does not only have a great story, it also is a good looking one. The movie uses some early and effective effects and uses some different color filters to create the right mood and to indicate what it past, present and 'future'.Sjöström did not only wrote and directed this movie, he also plays the main character. Of course the acting in the movie is over-the-top at times, by todays standards but not as bad as in for instance early German movies was the case. And after all, this movie is more about its story and morals than it is about the acting, so it really doesn't matter much, or distracts.A really great and effective underrated silent-movie classic from Sweden.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Körkarlen (1921), a classic film with cult status amongst the silent movies, directed by Victor Sjöstr?m, who also plays the male main role, is based on a story by Swedish novelist Selma Lagerlöf. The film tells the story of brutal drinker David Holm, who beats up his wife, neglects his children, seduces his brother to drinking and is blind for the love of nurse Edit (Astrid Holm). David sits toward the end of the year together with his boozing buddies in the city-park and tells the story of the Phantom Chariot (Körkarlen): Who dies in the New Year's Eve night as the last one before dawn, has to serve one year long as driver of Death and release the dying souls from their bodies. But David gets into a fight with his buddies, suffers a hemorrhage and sinks dead on the soil. Meanwhile, the Phantom Carriage is approaching. The driver is nobody else than David's late friend Georges who seduced him into alcohol and died one year before. Since David refuses to get on the carriage, Georges forces him. Together, they drive to the stations where people live who suffered from David. They visit the nurse Edit whose love to David he was unable to recognize and whom he infected with tuberculosis so that she is dying now. But her unconditioned love to David will save his soul. Fulfilled with her spirit, they get to David's wife and children. David is able to prevent his wife from killing herself and her children, because she does not see a way out of the misery in which David has thrown her. They also visit David's brother, who has committed a murder after having been seduced into drinking by David. David asks Georges to go back into his body, because he finally sees that his way was wrong. Since it was Georges who had seduced him once into drinking, David's wish is granted, he gets a second chance, and Georges has to be one more year the driver of the Phantom Carriage in order to pay for his own sins. This movie belongs probably to the strongest and most impressive films ever made. Deplorably, it is still not available on international DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive and Stylish Silent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the New Year's Eve, the tuberculous sister of the Salvation Army Edit (Astrid Holm) asks her mother and her colleague Maria (Lisa Lundholm) to call David Holm (Victor Sjöström) to visit her in her deathbed. Meanwhile, the alcoholic David is telling to two other drunkards in the cemetery the legend of the Phantom Coach and his coachman: in accordance with the legend, the last sinner to die in the turn of the New Year becomes the soul collector, gathering souls in his coach. When David denies to visit Edit, his friends have an argument with him, they fight and David dies. When the coachman arrives, he recognizes his friend Georges (Tore Svennberg), who died in the end of the last year. George revisits parts of David's obnoxious life and in flashbacks, he shows how mean and selfish David was."Körkarlen" is an impressive and stylish silent movie, with magnificent special effects (for a 1921 movie). The characters are very well developed; however, the story is dated and there is a weird and unexplained situation, when Sister Edit tells that she loves David Holm. Why should a enlightened woman love such a despicable man that wasted his life corrupting other people? Despite being religiously dated in the present days, it gives a beautiful message of faith and redemption in the end. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "A Carroça Fantasma" ("The Phantom Coach")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantastic use of double exposure and multiple flashbacks right from the gate in this exceptional Silent. The director himself plays the role of the wastrel David Holm, who recounts in flashback his friend Georges telling him of how the last person to die on New Year's Eve is compelled to take their place as driver of the phantom carriage and carry on Death's work of collecting souls.Not one to heed his own lesson, David gets into a drunken graveyard brawl immediately before the strike of midnight and finds that the driver who has come to collect him is Georges himself! What follows is a morality play with clear influences on Bergman in it's at times blackly comic tone, moral irony and mysterious imagery.One sequence in particular has the phantom carriage passing among the churning waves and debris of the seaside only to stop at the wreck of a boat. The driver then descends to find what at first appears to be a man sleeping peaceably on the ocean floor.There is also a flashback of a TB-ridden Holm brazenly coughing in the face of his sleeping infant as his wife looks on in dread. This is followed spectacularly by an axe sequence that Kubrick must have seen. Apparently, Sjostrom's early childhood was spent in turn of the century Brooklyn up until the death of his mother.The Dickensian moralistic elements of the story dominate the final chapter, predictably. Georges dutifully binds his old friend's discorporate soul with invisible chains and shows him the aftermath of his ways. But the technique and storytelling themselves are so powerful that this is not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergman-like Coachman Of Death Tale Memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Victor Sjostrom, who is the grandfather of Swedish cinema, directed this stark, existentialist film about atonement, betrayal, death, forgiveness, guilt, redemption, and the bleakest moments of the human condition. He stars as David Holm, a no good-nick who responds to a moment of kindness by returning to his drunken ways, only to later have to bargain for his soul with the driver of the phantom carriage: death.Unlike many silent films during the period, the film is nearly absent scenes with over-acting. The pacing does become tedious with its overly familiar Dickensian narrative. However, examining the film in retrospect and in comparison to others of its time, it's a very daring and unique film. Audiences of the time were not exposed to such subject matter, and the cinematography is tremendous, symbolic, and accompanied by double exposure effects and multi-layered flashbacks. It's a genuinely creepy and frightening film for youngsters for sure.Watching the film, it's easy to see the later influences this film had on Swedish master Ingmar Bergman. Most of the great Bergman themes are here on full display. Sjostrom, of course, later starred in Bergman's masterpiece on alienation and loneliness: Wild Strawberries. This would be Sjostrom's final performance as an actor. Sjostrom based the script on a novel by Swedish writer Selma Lagerlof. *** of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Happy New Year for Victor Sjöström</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once upon a time, in Sweden, there was a poor Salvation Army sister. At death's door, she requests, "Send for David Holm!" But, Victor Sjöström (as David Holm) cannot be located, because he is spending New Year's Eve in a graveyard, with his drinking buddies. Dying Sister Astrid Holm (as Edit) wants to see if praying for Mr. Sjöström's soul, over the past year, has produced any results; arguably, it has not. In the graveyard, Sjöström tells the story of "The Phantom Carriage", which he heard from his dead friend Tore Svennberg (as Georges). According to legend, the last person to die in each year must pick up the souls of all the dead people, until being relieved next New Year's Eve...Director Sjöström, whose lead performance is very strong, combines with photographer Julius Jaenzon to create a visually appealing film. The great "double exposure" effect is used frequently, but never seems overdone; and, it doesn't make the film's other dramatic highlights any less memorable (for example, Sjöström's tearing of his sewn coat and axing of the door). A Selma Lagerlöf story probably wasn't one you could, or would want to, tamper with in the 1920s - which may, or may not be, why the ending of this film is a letdown. And, unlike similar spiritual stories, it's difficult to suspend your disbelief, if you think too carefully about what is really happening in "Körkarlen".******* Körkarlen (1/1/21) Victor Sjöström ~ Victor Sjöström, Hilda Borgström, Tore Svennberg</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it any wonder I cry?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to silent cinema, it's often relayed by newcomers that getting past the sound (or lack thereof) barrier is one that is difficult or near-impossible to do. Indeed, I remember my first venture into the silent realm and well, let's just say I wasn't convinced and moved away for near-on a decade. It goes without saying that, now with more than a handful of silent films (many now among my all-time favourite movies) under my belt, it's probably best to appreciate that some of cinema's forgotten treasures are easier to digest in a modern world than others. Or, at least for the uninitiated. The Phantom Carriage, I'd like to think, is one of those that crosses the barrier with ease. Whether through its imaginative storytelling, compelling visual effects that even a CGI-laden teenager might decree as "impressive", or the mere pace at which the film moves along; Victor Sjöström's 1921 classic is surely a film with no limitations set merely by its year of production. Firstly there's the plot which, although has been beaten to death on screens for the past 90 or so years, is one that is readily engaging and compelling to this day. Echoing more famous films made later down the line such as It's A Wonderful Life or Scrooge among many others, Sjöström's adaptation of Nobel prize-winning author Selma Lagerlöf's 'Thy Soul Shall Bear Witness!' (the fourth adaptation of Lagerlöf's novels by Sjöström and A-B Svenska Biografteatern) is a wonderfully- told moralistic epic that swoons, sways, crashes and burns as each of the film's characters play out their parts in what is, for the most part, a very grim and starkly depressing story. It's also a tale steeped in mysticism and fantasy, and while I'm usually rather prickly when it comes to such works, when done as well as it is here you can't help but be whisked along quite willingly for 100 minutes or so. It had some small hurdles in getting green-lit back in the day because of certain touchy belief-systems, but eventually the studio decided it would better served facing the wrath of an omniscient deity than Selma Lagerlöf. A wise choice indeed.As a direct result of the plot's reliance on the supernatural and occult, Phantom Carriage also boasts visual effects that far-exceeded anything else on screens at the time in terms of realism and clarity. Even on the newly-released Criterion blu-ray the scenes involving ghostly phantoms look stunning, even though the HD format has a tendency to do the exact opposite, often drawing attention to the primitive techniques used at certain points in history. On the flip side of the coin however, Lagerlöf's story isn't merely about ghosts in the literal sense; in fact, it probably spends more time developing and exposing the emotional phantoms that haunt its characters during their waking lives. Sjöström excels here also, blending powerful but natural performances from his more than capable cast (which includes himself in the lead role) with the detailed and strikingly-lit photography of Julius Jaenzon to cast light and shadows upon the characters' emotive faces, and most importantly, their conflicted hearts. Cinematographers were doing great work already across many studios at the time, and while The Phantom Carriage stands out as one of the very best, it's the realistic and very-seldom melodramatic performances led by Sjöström himself that break the standard for 1921 more than anything else.Rounding out the package on the restored Criterion release are two soundtracks, one of which I haven't heard at this time. The first is a fantastic chamber orchestra score penned by Matti Bye in 1998. It's not your typical silent-movie score by any means; often it will delve into bizarre interludes and stanzas that mirror the action well, but never distract from the film. The second, which I haven't gotten around to yet, is an experimental piece by KTL recorded for a Tartan DVD release in 2008. From what I've read elsewhere it's even better than Matti Bye's, and if it furthers Phantom Carriage's already strong ability to step out of its 95-year-old history and appeal to modern audiences, then by all means. Overall, I cannot recommend this one enough. Compelling and highly emotive character fantasy-drama, start to finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very touching fable !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Phantom Carriage' is a very well known silent film which ended up massively influencing huge cinematic stalwarts like Ingmar Bergman and Stanley Kubrick to name a few. Written and directed by Victor Sjöstrom, the film is based on a book of the same name written by Selma Lagerlöf which itself was based on Swedish fairy tales. Sjöstrom himself played the lead character, David Holm.When talking about the themes of 'The Phantom Carriage', I think the first element that has to be addressed is that the film is at its core, essentially engulfed by Christian ideals and principles. The story is about the redemption of a sinner. David Holm is not at all a character who is likable. He is a drunk jerk, a person who refuses to mend his ways no matter what, a person who forces his family to pay for the consequences of his recklessness. However there are glimpses of his humanity scattered in parts in the film. Sjöstrom doesn't shy away from showing that the habit of self- destruction is not something that you can get rid of very easily. There are multiple occasions where others remind him of the man he used to be in order to force him to change his ways. But time and again we see him dismiss their efforts and resort back to his vile, disrespectful and self-destructive ways. There is a scene in the film where Holm is crying and he says that no one wants to believe that he can change and so he can't help but cry. I think this line was used by Sjöstrom as an ironic statement. Sjöstrom wants to imply that it is not others but Holm himself who doesn't want to believe that he can change and go back to being the man he was because he has lost all his faith in life and himself. The idea being advocated here I think is that no matter how much others try, in the end it's only you and your self-realisations that can change your nature. The character of David Holm really reminded me of the titular character played by Harvey Keitel in Abel Ferrara's 'Bad Lieutenant' which was another film dealing with the Christian ideas of redemption. The similarities in the two characters lie in their constant refusal to change and redeem themselves due to a probable lack of faith in their own selves and God. I also loved how the character of Holm goes from the Faust who gets turned to the dark side by the Mephistopheles Georges to becoming the one who himself entices others to the 'pleasures' of alcohol consumption.The basic plot has similarities with the story structure of Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol' and also with 'It's a Wonderful Life'. Much of the plot progresses with the help of flashbacks and Sjöstrom's screenplay very effectively shifts back and forth in time line. The acting also has to be really admired. Although there is usage of exaggerated expressions as was unavoidable in the silent era, there are also some precious moments of subtlety. Sjöstrom, Hilda Borgström and Astrid Holm are the three actors whose performances impressed me the most. Sjöstrom's direction is very assured. His frame compositions are great. There are some extremely haunting shots and images in the film like the extended shot of Mrs.Holm entering the Edit's room or the shot of Mrs.Holm standing with the kids on the pavement while David in his drunken state is lying at her feet, etc. to name a few. The quality of the double exposures to depict the ghostly carriage and spirits was also impressive and gave the scenes the eerie vibe they needed. The soundtrack works well to express the sorrowful spirit of the film.While watching the film I could easily notice how Bergman and Kubrick were inspired by this. The depiction of the grim reaper here must have been an influence for the character of Death in 'The Seventh Seal' and this plot structure of someone looking back at his life to realise the faults of his ways can be seen in Bergman's classic 'Wild Strawberries' where Bergman intentionally cast Sjöstrom in the lead role. When it comes to Kubrick, anyone who has seen 'The Shining', will easily notice the way this film influenced him.I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Phantom Carriage'. The film works as a cautionary tale about the consequences of selling yourself to the bottle and also as a character study based in the ideas of redemption. This is undoubtedly one of the great films from the silent era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE is another classic slice of Scandinavian horror and a follow-up for me after watching HAXAN: WITCHCRAFT THROUGH THE AGES. By comparison, this film's an entirely fictional production about the legend of a phantom carriage that trundles the globe, picking up the souls of the dead wherever it goes.A troup of main characters interact with this legend in a tale of debauchery, drunkenness, and eternal condemnation. The film is heavy on the melodrama but in its story of human relationships and depiction of the human condition it hasn't really aged all that much. Still, the slim narrative comes second to the extraordinarily spooky visuals, as this is a film all about the cinematography. Creepy tinting, bombastic music, and above all the wonderful double exposure effects of the ghostly carriage and its occupants are what you take away from this, and they're wonderfully spooky in the best Halloween tradition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impenetrable iconography and concepts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's undeniable that The Phantom Carriage's influence precedes itself. From its iconography of the grim reaper, it's Christmas Carol-esque tale of repentance, to echoes of Jack Nicholson chopping down the door in The Shining. If The Phantom Carriage is known for anything, it's for being Ingmar Bergman's source of inspiration for what his films would later muse upon. He would later recruit director and star Victor Sjostrom to lead on of his most acclaimed films Wild Strawberries. Of course, we already know how profound these concepts are nearly 100 years later and their importance is still imbedded in the film. It's fascinating to watch inventive techniques of translucence portrayed on screen too, though admittedly the prior year's Caligari is more impressive. Its real problem is undisciplined structure and its resulting poor pacing, but these are archaic issues of silent cinema that required a few years of trial and error. Nevertheless, the atmosphere is palpable, the ideas are timeless and it oozes with passion from Sjostrom, if not as nightmare worthy as the next year's Nosferatu.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Phantom Carriage moves slowly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to see where the great Swedish director Ingamar Bergman got his sense of humor in this film that informs in many ways his future work. Bergman was more than clear about Victor Seastrom's influence and The Phantom Carriage illustrates this with its stark death and redemption theme from the outset. On New Year's Eve, Edit, an urban missionary worker lies dying from consumption. She makes a request to see a notorious drunkard David Holm ( Seastrom ) one more time but he refuses to honor her request. He opts instead to remain with his drunken pals and tell the story of The Phantom Carriage that impresses the last person to die in the year to go around to pick up the dead. When Holm rebuffs the entreaty of Edit's co-worker his bottle buddies beat him to death and much to his grief he gets the job of the collector's assistant.The Phantom Carriage is one dark Christmas Carol. Filled with vices and virtue to the extreme it is a relentless treatise on pain, suffering and salvation with Seastrom's brutish unrepentant Holm blinded by drink and cynicism stewing in his own juices most of the way . Director Seastrom lays the dissipation on with a thick humorless brush with no let up and the gloom of this cautionary tale becomes monstrously oppressive and with it comes a repetitive monotony. The impact on such Bergman's classics as The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries (Sjostom actually played the lead) is more than evident throughout but so is the overwhelming stoicism that slows The Phantom Carriage to a crawl much of the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant ride with death, a horror film for the soul.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Korkarlen' really changed a lot of my feelings about the silent horror genre, although it isn't really fair to call 'Korkarlen' a horror film in the traditional sense. In some ways 'Korkarlen' surpasses 'Calgari' and 'Nosferatu' in sheer terror and it is a human terror that we feel. 'Korkarlen' is a scary film and braver in where it wants to bring it's audience than many films today.The mythology of the film is brilliant. Every New Year Death comes to collect the souls of the world. The last man to die on New Years is doomed to take the reigns of the Phantom Carriage, brilliant idea and it is executed better than anyone could have hoped for. 'Korkarlen' is visually a stunning horror film. The showcase of Death riding around is the stuff dreams are made of.The visuals of Death on his carriage riding through the night really rivals Scherk in Nosferatu and the power visuals of Calagari and yet unlike those films this terror is rooted in reality.Sjostrom creates a brilliant character in David Holm. Holm is not a likable character at all and probably deserves a punishment for his sins. Death punishes him in showcasing what he leaves behind. Some compare it to 'A Christmas Carol' and I really don't think that's accurate. I don't think Death is there to save Holm but rather to punish him. Holm must be punished for his deeds for the film to work. The scare that the film builds up to is Holm's final assessment of himself and his impact on the world. He realizes that his life up to that point had been meaningless and his only impact was in his hurting of others.What is our primal fear? Death and it is even more so today. Our mortality is one of the few things we are defenseless against. The Grim Reaper is the least subtle expression of death. The thought of the hooded unfeeling force designed purely on extracting souls is frightening. We don't fear Death as an entity but as an idea. What is there to fear after we die? The beyond? We have no choice in facing it. Sjostrom understands that what really is to fear is not where we are going but what we leave behind. That is what 'Korkarlen' is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Phantom Carriage VS The Stroke of Midnight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This landmark film can now be seen in two different versions on the Grapevine Video release which also includes the English translation of Selma Lagerlof's novel which she based on a Swedish folktale. The first version is the Swedish edit under the title of THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE. The second version is a reconstruction of the way it was shown in the United States under the title of THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT as released by Metro (before it was M-G- M). The actual US release has long vanished but a detailed review in The New York Times lets us know how the scenes were reordered for domestic release -- and both are fascinating to see. Each version of this film was presented at The Organ Loft in Salt Lake City with live theatre organ scores provided by artist Blaine Gale. A live recording was made of these performances and are included on the Grapevine Video DVD along with the novel and notes about the two versions. While THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE follows the order of Lagerlof's novel, THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT is in some ways easier to follow. Seeing the two different edits is an education in how silent films could be changed effectively for release in different countries. Some viewers look at this film as a horror film which it certainly is not. This is a morality play with shades of the supernatural used to hit home its stark message. The directing and lead performance by the great Victor Sjostrom were way ahead of their time. It's easy to see why M-G-M brought him to Hollywood to direct such films as Lillian Gish in THE SCARLET LETTER and THE WIND as well as Lon Chaney in HE WHO GETS SLAPPED. In America he was known as Victor Seastrom. He would also star in the lead role of Ingmar Bergman's WILD STRAWBERRIES, giving a masterful performance. Bergman was greatly influenced by KORKARLEN or THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE in his earlier days. This is a powerful film that is well worth taking some time to discover and study. The Grapevine Video release is an excellent way to do this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Citizen Kane of Silent Cinema?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1921's The Phantom Carriage is one of the many silent films I have viewed and enjoyed over the years. However, there is something that sets this film apart from the other great pieces of cinema which I have enjoyed. The story revolves around a variety of characters that are connected in some way to David Holm, (Victor Sjöström) a vile man who suffers from both tuberculosis and alcoholism. Holm is not only violent to his wife and children, but also actively tries to spread his illness to others. The film's first mentioning of him is from a dying woman who requests to see him before she passes away. Initially the audience is unsure what her relation with David Holm is; however as time passes we begin to learn that she was a Salvation Army parishioner who once looked over the homeless David Holm. Throughout this, the audience learns of the myth of Körkarlen i.e.: The Phantom Carriage. The viewer learns that at the end of every year the last evil person to die is damned to spend one year driving a carriage playing the role of death by reaping every soul who dies in the world for one year. After a fight which ends in Holm receiving a serious injury, David meets with the previous year's carriage driver and they discuss some of his wrong doings. The film is shot amazingly well, using creative camera angles and effective uses of fades, cross dissolves and double exposures. All of these things give the user an eerie feeling throughout the entire movie, as well as a sense of urgency as the dying Salvation Army parishioner moves closer and closer to her dying hour. The film effectively tells its story through uses of flashbacks, as well as through focusing on several characters, instead of just one. The film's story is similar to that of Dicken's A Christmas Carol, but has a far darker tone, as some of David's violent actions, as well as some of the carriage driver's duties are shown to the viewer in ways that are more direct than in A Chirstmas Carol. David Holm's attack on his family with an axe and attempts to give his children tuberculosis are good examples of this. The film can be accused of being a little bit preachy at times. The film makes no attempts to hide its anti-alcohol message, but this was after all filmed in an era where most countries were experiencing at least some measures of alcohol prohibition. Additionally, the film does have a very strong Christian tone to it, but it is far from being so preachy as to chase away a non-Christian viewer. When viewing the film, it is best that the viewer remembers that this film is a representation of the values and morals of the era which it was recorded in, not necessarily an attempt to tell the viewer how to live his or her lives. In its entirety The Phantom Carriage is a great film that was years ahead of its time. It is a film which is certainly on par with some of the finest pieces of cinema ever created. I believe that The Phantom Carrage can appeal to almost every viewer, even those who are not typically interested in silent films. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, if you haven't seen it yet, then do so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantasy film too sentimental to be called horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a mistake to refer to any film of this era as a horror film. Most early German films with supernatural themes are not so much horror films as they are dark fantasies borrowed from the works of early German Romantics like E. T. A. Hoffman and others. In Fritz Lang's "Der Mude Tod" (also from 1921) Death personified takes a young man away from his sweetheart, but in Lang's film the characters' destiny cannot be mitigated by behavior. Neither of the young lovers deserves to die, but they are destined by circumstances to be reunited only in death.In Victor Seastrom's "Korkarlen," however, repentance is always an option. Destiny can be altered - and death deferred - through the characters' choices. Although scenes of the Phantom Carriage collecting souls are genuinely eerie, these horrific images of Death as the great leveler are compromised by Death's offer of redemption to the real monster of this tale, David Holm, a brutal drunk who, because of a perverse hatred of humanity, spreads tuberculosis and emotional misery to everyone he comes in contact with.One New Year's Eve Holm is struck down in a fight with a drinking companion. As the first person to die on the stroke of midnight Holm must become the driver of the Phantom Carriage and collect souls during the new year. The Phantom Carriage, driven by an old acquaintance who had started Holm on his road to ruin, comes for his soul and takes him on a journey of self discovery. Along the way Holm sees the horror he has inflicted on his family and the people who tried to help him.Perhaps my disappointment with the film's ending is a criticism of the Selma Lagerlöf novel on which the film is based. But I would have preferred to see David Holm unable to escape his destiny, and to see his repentance come too late to prevent his wife from poisoning his two children and herself, and to see Holm suffer for the consequences of his sins by being made to collect their souls. It would have been a fitting punishment and a horror more immense than witnessing the abuse he inflicted on others. In the film, however, the unalterable nature of destiny isn't the message; redemption is. The driver of the carriage allows Holm's spirit to return to his body, and he rescues his family in the nick of time. His repentance smacks of Scrooge's repentance in "A Christmas Carol."If the trite and sentimental ending does not offend you, there is still much to admire in the film's images. The special effects are astonishing when measured by the standards of the day, and still hold up, which is more miraculous when you consider that these double exposures were created inside a hand-cranked camera. Also, the restored film on Tartan's new DVD looks fabulous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great for 1921 but very, very preachy when seen today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Victor Sjöström was quite the master in this film, having starred in it, directed it and even wrote the screenplay! That's pretty amazing. While today few have any idea who Sjöström was, he might be familiar to Ingmar Bergman fans as the star one of Bergman's most acclaimed films, WILD STRAWBERRIES.As far as this film goes, it's a very mixed bag. On one hand, you have to respect it because for 1921, it's a very good film. The idea of the Grim Reaper sitting down with a dead man to discuss his wasted life is pretty imaginative. Plus, the special effect of the Phantom Carriage is pretty convincing and technically speaking this is a well-crafted film. On the other hand, it's an amazingly dated and preachy film--more like something you'd expect to be shown in Sunday School instead of in an honest to goodness theater. Plus, some of the story elements just don't make sense. Instead of coming off as dedicated or good, the dying Salvation Army worker seems like a sap--a very sad and confusing sap. Why is she "in love" with this man? Am I missing something?So, my recommendation is that if you are insanely in love with silents (like me), then by all means watch it. But, if you aren't a silent fan, this film might do nothing to convince you that this style film is brilliant because the story is so overly melodramatic and dated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Sjostrom has painted a morbid picture of life in Europe's slums, using surrealist imagery and plain old sentimentality to tell his story of a consumptive bum (Sjostrom himself) who travels Europe seeking his deserter wife, but who seeks truly only his own demons and death. Interesting narrative structure allows for no suspense, but plenty of overlapping imagery.Not going to light a fire in too many modern movie lovers' hearts, but this one was influential and still packs a pretty heavy punch, especially when you see Sjostrom willingly inflicting his illness on others, including his own children. Must-see for fans of Bergman and later Swedish masters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sjostrom's penchant for stark reality in THE OUTLAW AND HIS WIFE and THE PHANTOM CHARIOT may be upsetting and depressing for some - certainly for myself (I see now where Ingmar Bergman learned his style and why he cast Sjostrom in one of his masterpieces). I expected power and visual beauty on the scale of his one masterpiece (in my book) THE WIND. This early tale of corruption, repentence and salvation is ugly and brutal but undeniably powerful. The narrative is laid down elsewhere in the reviews on this page. The early special effects are accurately done and though not impressive today, must have been so then. If you like Bergman, you will probably like Sjostrom. Those interested in a naturalistic, realistic silent cinema as opposed to Hollywood's gloss product will also enjoy this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Morality Play Disguised As Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>New Year's Eve. Three drunkards evoke a legend. The legend tells that the last person to die in a year, if he is a great sinner, will have to drive during the whole year the Phantom Chariot, the one that picks up the souls of the dead...Victor Sjöström directed this silent classic, and also stars as David Holm (who goes through various phases of respectability and homelessness). The film is notable for its special effects (double exposure), its advanced (for the time) narrative structure with flashbacks within flashbacks, and for having been a major influence on Ingmar Bergman.Bergman, easily Sweden's greatest filmmaker, was returning to this film his whole life, and the dark nature of Swedish cinema can probably be traced to "Phantom Carriage". For one example, Bergman cast Sjöström in the leading role for "Wild Strawberries", which also features references to the silent film.While presented as a horror film, this is not really fair. The horror elements can be found there, surely, but this is more of a take on Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Story". We have alcoholism replacing greed and New Years replacing Christmas, but there are many parallels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE (1921) This is a dark morality play that can't help but bring thoughts of A Christmas CAROL to mind yet there is no happy ending. Directed &amp; lead acted by Victor Sjostrom the man that inspired Ingmar Bergman to become a director it is a Swedish folktale as were many Swedish movies of the time. It revolves around the story of a relationship between a Salvation Army Worker (female) &amp; her attempt to help an alcoholic bum who only has negative affects on the lives of those around him. It's a truly dark movie in all aspects with hard lessons for everyone. Intentions are definitely shown here but the story is about actual effects.The FX of the carriage itself are startling &amp; better than you'd believe for such an early movie. My copy was a Criterion Edition &amp; I can only recommend that restoration as I've seen no other. This is a 10/10 for me. It is available in Criterion Blu-Ray also &amp; is 107 mins long, which is the full original Swedish version. English subtitles are included. One both my wife &amp; I are happy to own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark and riveting tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Victor Sjostrom directs and stars in this Dickensian tale of a man's fall into alcoholism and eventual redemption. With its dark setting in a dreary Swedish slum, it's surprising how riveting this movie is. A dying Salvation Army nurse, Edit, asks her associates to bring David Holm (Sjostrom) to see her. Holm is on a toot with two drinking buddies and relates to them a tale he heard, but does not really believe, about a carriage of death whose ensuing year's driver the man who dies at the stroke of midnight on New Year's eve. When Edit's associate comes and begs Holm to see her, he refuses. Holm's drinking buddies try to get Holm to visit the dying Edit and in a fight accidentally kill him - on the stroke of midnight on New Year's eve. The death carriage comes for him and the driver shows Holm his past through a series of flashbacks and how callous and frightening he had become. Edit's repeated attempts to reform Holm and reunite him with his wife and children failed. The double exposure scenes of the phantom carriage, of Holm, and of the driver collecting the souls of the dead are magnificent as was the acting of all the lead characters. The movie tells a dark story but does end with hope for Holm and perhaps for all of us. Holm's final prayer. "Lord, please let my soul come to maturity before it is reaped." A fascinating movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkable Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read a great deal of work on cinema and yet had never heard of this film. It is a remarkable example of the best the silent era had to offer. The acting is subdued and believable. More is done with the faces and postures of the characters than is done with most modern films. Sjostrom a the lead character has the marvelous ability to show a kind of kind exterior while suffering inside. There are times when we see him on the edge of salvation, but he thinks a moment and pulls back inside. He is so set on the revenge on his wife that it trumps everything, even the lives of his little children.It is the story of a Salvation Army worker, a young woman, who is dying of consumption. On her death bed, she calls for David Holm to be brought to her. The response from those around her is that of fear and disgust. Yet she persists and her cohorts start a search for him. It is unsuccessful since he has determined to have nothing to do with her. Even the wife is brought to the young woman. She is in incredible pain. We now get the story in a series of flashbacks, precipitated by the story of the Phantom Carriage which is driven by the last sinner to die on New Year's Eve. He must put in one year before he is released to his reward. David, instead to going to see Edit (the young woman), gets in a fight with his drinking buddies and is killed, just a few seconds before midnight.This is a story of reclamation, which is one of my favorite themes. It is rather Dickensian in some ways. The beauty of this is that we are treated to the incredible resistance to transformation that Sjostrom's character puts up. This is one of the better movies I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The early Stage of Swedish Films?From the Very Beginning to the Golden Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Swedish films and Scandinavian films in general, are known for stark landscapes and slow pacing. With the development of cinema and the technological and narrative development of film itself, Swedish films distinguished itself from the very beginning, which could be well illustrated from the film of Victor Sjöström.First shown in 1896 in Malmö, films came into Sweden's society. It was during the 1930s that going to the movies became a common form of popular entertainment, a circumstance that is reflected in production statistics: in 1929 only six Swedish films premiered, whereas by 1939 the number has grown to thirty-one. (Wright, 1998 pp1-2) When Svenska Biografteatern moved from Kristianstad to Lidingö in 1911, which had two star directors: Victor Sjöström and Mauritz Stiller, Swedish filmmaking rose to international prominence. But an early debate soon spread.On Nov.13th 1913, Victor Sjöström's famous film?Ingeborg Holm was shown in Stockholm, which had provoked a furious debate in the press. The headline in Stockholm daily Dagens Nyheter read 'poor relief under attack at the movies'. Meanwhile, a poor relief inspector penned an angry article in Stockholm Dagblad entitled 'unwholesome cinematography'. On the other side, a defensive rebuttal stressed the intention of Ingeborg Holm to depict conditions in rural areas, as opposed to Stockholm, while maintaining that the film industry had a responsibility to promote social progress. (Florin, 2003, pp 61) The debate actually spawned 1918 amendments to Sweden's poor relief law. On the one hand, we do see an early illustration of the impact that film can have on the world around it; on the other hand, the government agency for film censorship did play an indefensible role at that time.Despite of the debate, and while being labeled as one of the pre-classic film, Ingeborg Holm is a shining example of staging in depth. According to Barry Salt, this film has a dramatic depth and power resulting almost entirely from the handling of narrative and acting that is superior to anything. (Olsson, 1994, pp 117) For example, the staging of Sven's death very consciously utilizes the two planes of depth in the take. While Sven dies in the foreground, the rest of family is involved with other things in the room beyond, unaware of what has happened. When Ingeborg comes to the bed, we can confirm the reflection of her. This is quite fit to the definition of narration by Bordwell, which is the process whereby the film's syuzhet and style interact in the course of cueing and channeling the spectator's construction of fabula. (Bordwell, 1985, pp 53) The success of Victor Sjöström can't be a single phenomenon. At that time, the film industry developed quickly in Sweden. Svenska Biografteatern, as one of the oldest Swedish film company, was founded in 1907. After moving to Lidingö, it had a considerably large studio (20*7 meters). Meanwhile, they used the distribution network of Pathe Freres. And the First World War happened to be convenient to Svenska Bio. The war caused a scarcity of film in the countries involved and the Swedes were also favored politically by the fact that their competitor Denmark's previously popular films were rejected by the allies due to its close connection with Germany. (Soila, 1998, pp 150) Sjöström's film Terje Vigen succeeded in that period, which is not only a major artistic triumph for Svenska Biografteatern and everyone who contributed to its making, but it is likely to lend Swedish industry an illustrious international reputation.(Florin, 2003, pp 64) And in Gothenburg, Hasselbald, as the biggest competitor to Svenska Bio in Sweden at that time, with other film companies, formed the new Filmindustri Inc Skandia in 1918, which introduced a number of new directors who were to remain in the industry for many years. In 1921, after petition for bankruptcy, the large amounts of Skandinavisk's assets also went Svensk Filmindustri.In 1921, Victor Sjöström's film The phantom Carriage was shown. Not only did it turn out to be the golden age's most sophisticated production, but it boasted of a plot that flung wide the doors to timeless and legend. (Florin, 2003 pp 74) A lot of methods have been used in this film to give it narrative richness, like the camera-work, the use of flashbacks and the ability to reproduce the mood of the Selma Lagerlöf tale. Especially, the double exposures in the film are still stunning by virtue of their effectiveness and brilliant execution.The technical perfection in the film like creating a feeling of dizziness, literally forging a connection between the world of here and now and an unknown, mysterious realm the dissolves work as analogy, are all due to the long period of post-production. The phantom carriage allowed the ghost characters to walk around in three dimensions, being able to first be covered by an object in the foreground, but when in the same take walking up in front of the object; it would be seen through the ghost's semi-transparent body. According to the Swedish Film Institute, one difficulty in the film was that cameras were hand-waved, meaning that the camera had to be waved with exactly the same speed in the different layers for the end result to appear natural.If the dissolves represent the most compact visual tokens of transformation in the film, that is also its most recurrent theme. At the beginning he appears to be evil. In the following sequences, we see him as dead and then as a spirit, revealing that he had once been a good person. Resurrected, he recovers his original virtue. a chronological recapitulation of those events at the level of plot would go as follows exemplary husband and father, boozer, corpse spirit, resurrected and again righteous.The phantom carriage has such a influence that latter, Ingmar Bergman said he watch it once a year. The great influence of a masterpiece, that may be the real reason for people always feel nostalgic to the era labeled as GOLDEN.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Early Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is certainly no product of Hollywood. The visuals have to be among the bleakest on record, where there's no attempt to prettify anything. So, what we've got as a result is the look and feel of what amounts to an alternate universe, grim and foreboding. It's this mood that carries the movie even when the acting and motivations falter. (I agree that Edit's undying love for David makes little sense within their skimpy context).To me the story comes across as a Christian fable of sin and redemption. David is able to escape his fate by a heartfelt act of bended-knee repentance, while the saintly Edit's prayers are finally answered. After all, David's salvation (and his family's) must be the result of supernatural intervention since the grim reaper admits he's powerless to alter anyone's fate. What the movie does so effectively is combine the subtle religious message with a supernatural mood that surprisingly suggests the absence of a divinity, an absence symbolized by the horror of the reaper and his ghostly carriage. No wonder religious existentialists like Ingmar Bergmann have been inspired by this early effort. (In fact, the hooded figure of "Death" in Bergmann's Seventh Seal {1956} bears a distinct resemblance to the reaper}.)The narrative is pretty uncompromising, conveying little distinction between reality, dream, or flashback. But I expect that adds to the overall surreal mood. The spectral images are well done for such an early stage in film technology and chillingly convey another dimension. Despite the occasional crudities the movie remains a highly compelling antique. But I wouldn't recommend it as relaxing entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is, quite simply, the first masterpiece of cinema. An incredibly moving tale, it takes a simple plot and executes it brilliantly. Similar to Dickens' Christmas stories, a deceased man is taken on a journey to show the suffering he has wrought in his life of drunken debauchery.The moral centre of the film is the saintly Sister Edit who somehow sees Christ in this fallen man and seeks to save him, though it will cost her her own life.The cinematography is of an exceptionally high standard, with excellent use being made of chiaroscuro-style lighting in particular. Tinted film stock conveys atmosphere and the ghostly effects are simple by modern standards, yet extremely well-executed.The film builds towards a dramatic and heart-rending climax.The portrayal of the alcoholic David is subtle. Reminiscent of a character in Waiting for Godot, he kicks out at those who try to help him and offer charity. He is both a frightening monster and extremely human and vulnerable. The growth of his character throughout the film is plausible and extremely well-done.This, then, was the first perfect film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good early drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched this about three months ago and was somewhat disappointed, but after watching it a couple more times I've started to appreciate it more, just not for the reasons I'd expected.The carriage and driver are a striking image and the multi-exposure effects are the best ever in a film of this age. Seeing one of these clips is what made me anticipate watching the entire film. Turns out this is a minor part of the movie. Think Hitchcock's magguffin; it isn't about the Death Carriage. It is, rather, a morality tale about a mean alcoholic reflecting on his life. The story could have been done with or without the carriage.And the story is certainly well done. I'm actually more impressed with Sjostrom's script and his acting than with the directing, which is stagnant, but no more so than most films of this era.So, I came for supernatural horror and got horrific drama instead. Slow pacing and staging keep this one from greatness but it is engrossing by the end of it.A couple quick notes on the Criterion DVD. Excellent commentary by Casper Tybjerg (who also does the commentary track on Haxan). Two scores that I would never listen to on their own; the KTL score does fit the movie though, the Bye score does not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Phantom Carriage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was younger I may not have enjoyed silent black and white films as much as I do now, I have found real gems from the past history, and this was another that featured in the book 1001 Movies You See Before You Die I was looking forward to. Basically it is New Year's Eve, and Salvation Army nun sister Edit (Astrid Holm) is dying (possibly of tuberculous), and on her deathbed has only one wish to ask her Mother (Concordia Selander) and her colleague Maria (Lisa Lundholm). Her wish is to see David Holm (Wild Strawberries' Victor Sjöström, also directing), an alcoholic drinking himself stupid with his two companions (Simon Lindstrand and Nils Elffors), and telling them the legend of The Phantom, i.e. Death, or the Driver (Olof ?s) on his Carriage/Chariot/Coach, as told by his old friend Georges (Tore Svennberg). In the legend the Phantom not only takes away people's souls, but every New Year's Eve the last sinner to die on the strike of midnight is the one will take Death's place and become the Grim Reaper. David refuses to see Edit, and he has an argument with his friends which ends with him dying, and of course the soul collector shows up to take him away, and taking off his hood we see it is Georges. As the soul of David steps out of his body, Death reminds him of all the good he had in his life, which we obviously see through flashbacks. He had a happy family life with his wife Anna (Hilda Borgström) before joining Georges and other drinkers, and he ended up arrested for being intoxicated. It is revealed in the past, exactly one year ago, that Edit took care of David, and that he made a promise to her, before turning bad, but the promise was not fulfilled, so Death is taking him to her to do it. Back in the flashbacks there was some Salvation Army meeting that Edit and David attended, and also his wife Anna, where he was made to try and to submit to God, but the drinking continued and he developed tuberculous. While suffering the disease he tried to get to Anna and their children who he tormented, and one night they locked themselves in the kitchen, and he gets in chopping through the door with an axe (just like The Shining fifty nine years later). Back to David and Death, Edit begs not to have her soul taken away yet, she feels she is the one to blame for everything, but he is there teary, and she dies peacefully as a non sinner. In the end Death also takes David to see Anna who planned to kill herself and their children, he begs Georges the reaper and God to intervene, and he is allowed to return to life and embrace it again. Also starring, Tor Weijden as Gustafsson, Einar Axelsson as David's Brother and Nils Aréhn as Fängelsepredikant - Prison Chaplain. The picture may have peculiar changes in colour, yellowish, red and blue, and be a bit scratchy, but it makes completely with the earlier attempts of fading shots to create the ghostly allusions and souls leaving bodies, it is a spooky and very watchable Swedish silent fantasy drama. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Phantom Chariot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phantom Chariot, The (1921) ** (out of 4) Victor Sjostrom's forgotten Swedish horror/fantasy flick was a major influence on Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal. The film tells the Swedish legend that if a sinner is the last to die on New Year's Eve then the following year he must be Death and drive a chariot to pick up the souls of other sinners. Sjostrom plays a drunk who dies seconds before midnight on New Year's Eve and must take over the role of Death. I was really letdown by this film but to be fair I did have pretty high expectations. The opening twenty minutes are extremely well done with some very eerie shots of Death going around picking up various souls. However, the second half of the film turns into A Christmas Carol like story and gets bogged down in melodrama. Sjostrom is very good in his role and the special effects are quite good for their time. Original title: Korkarlen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it's like a David Lynch film, maybe a bit like Mulholland Drive: are we watching what did happen, is happening or is about to happen? even more than in Mulholland Drive: are these images the truth? we are told it's New Year's Eve and it seems like the persons are not human, but ghosts... what a strange story this seemed out to be. it's not simple to obtain. when we finally see the carriage of death mixed between images of the fall of night and somebody we falls (into death, I guess), the carriage stops. so there really is an entity who collects our souls? an entity that cannot be stopped, or so it seems... again I ask myself: is this reality? are we watching the truth? and even if it is, how can this be proved? yes, like we are told, it's a hard task to do. imagine yourself collecting souls from the damned... it gives me the creeps! but let's make sure this is fiction and not reality... even if a story within the story of a movie often is truthfully. the story about the identity of the carriage driver is a bit silly, even though it is supposed to be silly because we get to know this information when we see again the hermit's telling each other ghost stories (in movies, what we are shown, we must interpret as fiction). as in Mulholland Drive, we are being fooled: is this just a movie? is it a dream? is it just a story being told? is it reality? and what about the time? are we seeing what happened or are we witnessing new occurring things? the two constantly over each other projected images are a bit confusing too. and even if the story is correct, we don't know exactly what we see. the truth about the carriage of death is creepy, but the eerie factor soon makes place for the mysterious storyline. so the hermits are responsible for the agony showed in the picture? or is everything just fantasy? sometimes it's really annoying not to know what you're being showed. everything gets a whole lot weirder when we witness a kind of prison, or is it an asylum? or both? and when are we witnessing this? and why? and what? the storyline isn't always very obvious. but maybe that's the whole point: maybe the opportunity to see things as they are (or as we think they are), is only possible in the time we live, not when we're dead. Körkarlen is a very old but good movie, because it makes the viewer wonder a lot about the things he sees. is the audience crazy? is the main character crazy? are we the main character? is this some weird BEEP as in The Cabinett of Doctor Caligari? it seems like that, but only the ending will show us the truth about the movie (in fact, the truth is what you make of it). actually, it's not very clear who (or what) the main character is. is he dead? is he crazy? is he just telling a story? some films may have replicated this one, like Ingmar Bergman in The Seventh Seal - I mean the beginning with the chess board game, it looks a lot like the story the ghosts (or hermits?) tell each other. in fact, the whole idea of a Bond villain talking about his master idea for the perfect crime, could be literally taken from these scenes where everybody does more talking than thinking (except of the audience, off course). when suddenly nurses appear, everything gets more complicated than it already has been. are we in a mental constitution? are we in a hospital? again the question means more than the answer. it's the question that drives us. maybe we are one of the nurses... are we dead nurses? are we nurses of the dead? are we dying nurses? are we patients of an asylum who think they are men but in fact are women? many things can be said about these interpretations and I'm surely not the first one to make them. are the characters men or women? or they rich, poor, crazy or plainly old hermits? or beggars? are we begging to save our lives? are we communicating with the dead? as we are being told: you cannot escape your fate! it's useless to fight the dead: they will always win. so the dying will die and prayers will not save them... or do they? an very original question being asked in this very old horror movie. if prayers can save us, we must pray! yes, this movie is very religious... like Jean Jacques Rousseau once wrote: if plants (or prayers) could help us, every disease (or death) would be caused by (the will of) ourselves. so if the line of life does cross with the life after death, some terrible things can happen, like what does happen in Körkarlen. terrible things, as in The Shining. a scene very similar to the Here's Johnny scene in The Shining finds place in this spooky silent. yes! exactly the same! Stephen King, you copycat (just joking)! but, coming to the end of my review, what do we learn from Körkarlen? that life and death must be separated forever, or else all hell breaks loose? that the best scene of The Shining already was shot in Körkarlen? that David Lynch knows his classics? no: in fact, every horror movie is the retelling of the all known Faust story. but if you want my honest opinion as a scout: this movie is BEEPy boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought it would be more fantastic a tale. But the subject is rather down to earth compared to the story about the Death carriage I was expecting. In fact there is much more of a social drama. As usual in the "European authors' movies".Actors are interesting, not overacting as in the average silent movie. Images are not so good as to be stuck in your mind as in Bergman's Smultronstället.This is true the comparison between the two movies is the main point here. Smultronstället begins with a vision of a Death carriage wherein Sjöström's character can see his own body. There are clocks without hands. He is compelled to look back on what he has done wrong. There is a vision of his happy family in the country. In Körkarlen Sjöström's wife doesn't cheat on him before his eyes but she wants to flee with the little children because it would never get any better with him. Eventually, Edit's confession is some kind of a live judgement.Well I would just add that Sjöström destroying the door with an axe because his wife locked it and plans to go away with the children reminded me of The Shining. Which was much more of a fantasy tale with Death hanging around.</fullReview>
