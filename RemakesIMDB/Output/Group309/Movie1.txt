		<shortDescription>Sambho Siva Sambho Review..... An entertainer with message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie- Sambho Siva Sambho Release date- 14 January 2010 Rating- 4.5/5Sambho Siva Sambho is undoubtedly a film that deserves to be watched, and that too not just once, but multiple times. This film is the best of Ravi Teja and all actors involved in making this movie. It's a big, big, big problem of some critics to pan a movie that brings message for the society. But forget the critics' reviews and watch this movie. Believe me you won't be disappointed.This film is one of the most decently made movies in South Cinema. Ravi Teja, Allari Naresh, Siva Balaji and all actors have given their best performances. The comedy of Sunil is good and provides relief. The chase sequence before interval is the highlight of the movie. The fight scenes are well choreographed and the film makes one go emotional at times. This is a clean family entertainer for all.On the whole, Sambho Siva Sambho is a fun packed entertainer that will take on your emotions and would entertain you at best. Go, watch it!</fullReview>
