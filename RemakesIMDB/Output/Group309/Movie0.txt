		<fullReview>This film is good. But not like the previous one of Sasikumar where he himself took care of the direction department. Here, his friend Samuthrakani is the captain and he is an actor. This film speaks all about the increasing divorces in India with much commercial aspectsThe plot runs like this... Karuna, Pandi and Chandran are very close friends who all are someway or the other waiting for their job. Karuna tries to be a government employee to marry his beloved Nallama. Chandran eyes on Karuna's sister. The movie goes pleasant until a schoolmate of Karuna arrives and attempts for suicide. Karuna and team learns the reason to be his failure to marry his beloved gal, as her millionaire dad is not willing and his mother too a leading politician not interested in the marriage. Karuna and friends rescues the couple and arranges for a honeymoon vacation. Karuna is hit in head, Pandi becomes deaf and Chandran looses his one leg in the operation. After a few days, they learn the couple are not mates anymore. When questioned, both are not even ready to give a reply. What will be the revenge of the Karuna team is the remarkable climax. Don't miss the competitive acting of Sasikumar &amp; Bharani. A very good performances from Sasi, Bharani (watch out his outstanding comics in first half and as a vengeance filled deaf in the later), Ananya, Abinaya, Jeyaprakash and Namo Narayana. Music is acceptable. But a couple of unneeded songs. good message with a commercial value</fullReview>
