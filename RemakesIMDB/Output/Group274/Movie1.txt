		<shortDescription>Yet another unnecessary remake....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off: I love the original french Martyrs(2008), but I still had some issues with it which would make this a prime target for remaking. So I started watching this movie with an open mind, hoping for the best preparing for the worst... And sadly, it turned out to be the latter.It starts off the same, but without the eeriness of the original, granted that could be because I already had seen the original so I'll give that a pass. The acting is fine for what it is, but it's shot way worse than the original. (And yes, I'm gonna keep comparing it to the original) but it's just "blah"... They totally waste Toby Huss, I'm a big fan of his and was looking forward to see him in this, but yeah that don't pan out.The ending, my favorite part from the original, is... "americanized". Let's say that. The one part from the original that really sticks with you and they throw it away like an unwanted fetus on prom-night.Do not watch this movie! Watch the french original, it's the same thing but better. So sum Martyrs(2015) up in one word: Unnecessary!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hacked to s&amp;*t (and not in a good way)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I'm a big fan of the original French version of Martyrs (2008). This is one of those movies that stays with you long after you have watched it. When I heard of a remake for the American audience, I thought it would be great and would love to see what could be done with it. I went into seeing this movie very excited. It starts off similar to the French version, but seemed to lack a bit of the eerie atmosphere the original had. The characters seemed a bit more likable in this version, so I started to get a bit more excited about it the further it went.The story then take a left turn and seems very rushed once all of the action starts. The original version is a lot bloodier and contains a lot more violence. This version hints to the violence taking place but never shows whats going on. The ending, which in the original, is the part of the movie that sticks with you, is hinted to, but again, never shown. I recommend that if you do decide to watch this movie, what the original version first. Hey America, if you're going to do a remake, do it properly and don't hack a film to shite!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not even going to lay out a plot blurb for this, because if you are planning on seeing it, chances are you have already seen Pascal Laugier's 2008 original and know what's up. In fact, it's probably not inaccurate to say that the only people who may be seeing this film are those already acquainted with the source material, as this remake had virtually zero publicity, a sad excuse of a theatrical release, and a buzz that was DOA. By most accounts, this remake of "Martyrs" was doomed by the mere fact of it being a remake; it's difficult to outdo something with as much palpable intensity and thematic abhorrence as the original film. and that's precisely where this film most falls flat. There is an inexplicable feeling of shallowness to the picture that pervades it from nearly beginning to end. Part of it is the lackluster cinematography, and part of it is the lack of dynamism in the performances, but most of all, it feels like the filmmakers in general were dispassionate about the material itself, and it shows.The truth is, a remake could have worked, but it would have needed at least a little life breathed into it, and this film feels like it was taken off life support from day one. The script here is near identical to the original film's, and it begins as a near shot-for-shot remake, but falls off that train within the first ten minutes. In fact, the film only really begins to diverge in the final act, which is honestly where I found the it to be most convincing. I may be the minority here, but I actually thought the way they rewrote the conclusion was clever and intriguing without being too much of a touchy-feely tradeoff?it still maintained the dark nerve of the original's ending, which I respected, and the last five minutes may be the only portion of the film that I truly thought was worthwhile.The acting here is decent, but the lead female actresses at times seem to be going through the motions. Some obtuse dialogue doesn't exactly help matters either. Kate Burton is an interesting and solid choice for the cultist matriarch, and I actually enjoyed her performance in this quite a bit. Overall though, "Martyrs" only barely begins to scratch the surface of what the original film did, and it's unfortunate. It fails to capture any of the remote coldness, psychological disconnect, or stark brutality that made the original film so unforgettable, and ends up feeling like little more than a direct-to-video horror flick with about a fifth of the vitality. When watching the remake, one feels like the film is self-consciously going through the motions, and when taking into consideration its stodgy demeanor, failed distribution, and complete lack of any and all promotion, "Martyrs" 2016 ultimately feels like a production that was given up on before it had even begun. Where the original was gutsy, stylish, and unsparing, the remake manages to be the film equivalent of a death rattle. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rare Fan Of The Original That Actually Liked It.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike most others, I welcome horror movie remakes. I know that most end up being trash. But there are the few that end up being decent horror movies in their own merit. Yes, I'm a fan of the original 2008 French film Martyrs. I mean I really loved the intense raw terror of the original. But like most have said, it wasn't just about the terror. It had deep meaning. Which is why it has become one of the biggest horror cult classics of the past 20 years. So when I heard that they were making an American remake, I was honestly excited. The producers promised to keep the intensity of the original. This announcement was way back in 2010. So you can imagine I've been waiting nearly 6 years for this. Now the film is finally here. I will admit that the trailer for the film released online made it look very mediocre. And I knew that most other fans of the original would trash the film relentlessly regardless of its true value. It is hard to not compare this to the original. The critics reviews seem implausible too. I guess I'm the rare fan of the original that actually liked it. *Basic Plot* A girl escapes from captivity from being tortured on a daily basis. The police return to find the torture site abandoned. The girl is sent to an orphanage where she befriends another orphan girl and sees visions of a monster. Years later as an adult she tracks down her captors and takes revenge, which sets off a chain of even more terrifying events for her and her best friend. That really is just a typical summary of the plot to lure you in. It's for the most part a carbon copy of the originals story. Some scenes are shot for shot. There are a few tweaks that are "Americanized", but are still a bit intense compared to other horror remakes that seem dumbed down. I will admit that upon my first viewing I was disappointed in the handling of the ending. But the film still stuck with me long after. I read all these negative reviews prior and expected the holy grail of terrible remakes. I'm glad to find out most of those reviews are completely misguided. Yes, it pales in comparison to the original. But it is not nearly as bad as other fans have said it is. They seem to blindly hate it. I read one negative review that pointed out that the movie had country music, as if that played a big part in the soundtrack, when in reality it was literally just 10 seconds of the music near the beginning. Others say the acting is typical terrible American remake bad acting. Again, wrong. Sure it wasn't Oscar worthy acting. But it was all believable. Yes, the ending and captivity scenes are changed a lot. They are still intense, but less effective. BUT, still pretty good. I think the movie was still a pretty good horror film. There were scenes of brooding terror in the beginning. The musical score is very epic and emotional for a horror movie. The acting is pretty good. The production value is really good for a low budget remake. There are some visual shots during the daytime scenes that are eye candy. The message the original sent out is still present, just not delivered nearly as well. But it's still there! The ending will disappoint fans of the very memorable finale of the original, but in its own context it works decently. So all these insanely negative reviews should not be taken that seriously until you've seen the movie for yourself and will form your own positive or negative opinion. Believe it or not, even the original hasn't been seen by everyone. So most early reviews for this remake are from disgruntled fans of the original who went out to do nothing but trash this film. Of course if you saw the original and liked it, you will have a hard time not comparing the two. At first I was comparing them, but once I looked at this movie as a standalone horror film pretending the original didn't exist, I found it to be a pretty good horror experience. For the moment, I'd trust the opinion on this film of someone who hasn't seen the original more than the angry fans. Because their minds are fresh. They won't be overly nitpicky. Some will, but most might appreciate this for it's true value. Sure its not nearly the best horror movie ever made, but it's one of the best remakes. I'd bet anything that if this was released nationwide in theaters first, that it would get a warmer response from reviewers. I say if you haven't seen the original, you'll have a better time seeing this on your horror movie night. If you did see the original I strongly recommend you try your hardest not to compare the two and view this as if its truly a standalone film. I predict as time passes by this will find a small cult following. The reviews will slightly get better. Either way, turn up the volume, turn off the lights, and enjoy. **Fun Fact** The writer of this remake is the same man who wrote the adapted screenplay for the award winning film The Revenant. Believe it or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shell of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Martyrs is one of my favorite horror movies of all time. I'd even rank it up there with The Exorcist, another film that pushed the envelope and was ahead of its time. Unfortunately, because of the original's cult status, a remake was inevitable. Does it do the original any justice? I can't say that it does. And I honestly feel bad for the directors. They were simply set up for failure. If you are curious about the remake, watch it. I'd read the bad reviews, but I still had to see how it held up to the original. Just too bad it doesn't at all. I will say the acting and score were decent. Again, not as good as the original, but good nonetheless. If you've never seen the original or remake, please watch the original first. Yes, you will have to read subtitles, but I'm gonna assume most of you have a third grade education and can read.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary and Plain Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Martyrs is one of my favorite movies of all time, so even though I knew the remake couldn't beat it, I still had to watch. Perhaps if the original never existed and this was the original, or if I had never seen the original, I might think it was passable. Unfortunately, the original does exist and is much, much , MUCH, better. First off, they seem to have completely dumbed-down the plot in the remake. One of the best parts of the original is that you are never completely sure what is going on or why. The remake just spills it all out as soon as possible. I don't think American viewers are dumb, so I do not know why they insist on doing this. Yes, the original is gorier and more violent. But it adds to what the film is trying to accomplish. With this film, we barely even see what horrors are occurring. My favorite parts of the original are replaced with clichéd, expected scenes. The mood and acting is reminiscent of a typical teen horror slasher flick, nothing like the original. Overall, 3/10, and that's being generous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollow and bland.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A woman and her childhood friend seek out revenge on those who victimized and abused them. Directly by the Goetz brothers, Kevin and Michael (Scenic Route), and written by Mark L. Smith (The Revenant), Martyrs feels like a film making a statement that it doesn't quite understand. Exposition delivered from the members of the mysterious organization is clunky, and is said with such gravitas that it would be easy to mistake it for trying to make a point. However, when you step back and look at it, it quickly becomes clear that the movie is saying nothing at all. The original film presented as a slightly more intellectual exercise than it really was, however the first effort in 2008 still managed to back up it's "big ideas" with an intensely brutal film. I hesitate to make too many comparisons to the original movie, as I don't find that helps to have much of a conversation about a remake, but this version has forced me to do so. Despite following, essentially, the same story line as the original, there is something strangely safe about this movie. The brutality and edge has been sanded off of the story, and you're left with something that feels amateurish and a bit like the first feature of a film school graduate. Had this been the directorial debut of the Goetz, this may have made more sense, but they've made films before, and this missed the mark. It seems that in it's Americanized form, Martyrs has become a generic movie that brims to the top with mediocre dialogue, and just-OK performances. The two actors are flat, though I have a feeling they will be given credit for their ability to scream and cry, though it's in subtle parts of a performance that an actors ability really shines and that doesn't seem to be present here. There's a lot of exposition and back story building both between our two main characters becoming friends in an orphanage, as well as the conversation about what Martyrs are. The film's ideas and themes are spoon-fed to the audience rather than allowing for subtlety. The unfortunate thing is, that had this not been a remake and stood alone as a new and unique story, you could make the case for it actually not being a bad movie. That said, it's impossible not to draw comparisons and see the ways in which the original film did the same basic story in a substantially better way. You are taken through the protagonist's suffering and forced to live it with her in the original, in this, we have are shown a few grim scenes and then expected to understand the suffering. It's all very bland this time. Martyrs does succeed in one area, and that is the cinematography. The overall look of the movie, and the way many shots are composed is quite appealing, if not a bit boring near the end. It feels like more time was spent in the beginning of the film, and less and less attention was paid as the ending approached. Perhaps it was shot chronologically and the money just ran out by the end. The final scene, for example, appears to have been thrown together for $80, while the first half of the movie really is well assembled. Most disappointing is the ending of this movie. The original film was bleak, and quite upsetting to watch. The protagonist was flayed alive, and there is a brutal and yet beautiful scene of a skinless Anna having become a "martyr". This time around, however, the flaying has been omitted completely and instead, Lucie has her back sliced up and she is put up on a cross with straps. It removes the punch and the impact of the ending, in favour of a clichéd ending in which Anna escapes death and fights her way back to rescue her friend. They share a loving moment together and the movie fades into a flash back. Creating an ending as bland as the rest of the movie was. This is a case of "I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed". It's not completely incompetent, but it's really just another generic horror movie amidst a sea of generic horror movies. If you haven't seen the original yet, I'd recommend giving it a watch, and if you have, just watch it again and let's all forget about this one. What a shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst remake I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of extreme horror, but I was in no way a die hard Martyrs fan. I saw the original, was impressed, but that was about it. When I heard about this remake I was immediately disgusted with the idea of why the people who make movies at the level of 'Annabelle' would try to remake such an iconic classic in the horror world. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and watched it. I have never been more angry with a movie. Imagine Titanic being remade, but the ship doesn't sink and everyone lives happily ever after. That is what they did to this movie. I was blown away by how literally EVERY scene and plot point this movie is known for was removed entirely. I know remakes tend to change some details for the audience of that country etc, but they basically wrote a whole new movie 30 minutes in. This would have been far better off if they took their plot of 'BFF's live happily ever after' and just made an original movie. Worst excuse for a remake, I knew they wouldn't do Martyrs justice, but this was just pathetic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I watched this film I thought to myself, did the directors (Kevin Goetz and Michael Goetz) believe this remake would be better than the original?! I'm thinking, they seen the French version of Martyrs, did they not feel the original film was at the very least a horror masterpiece?! What possessed them to think..."We're going to remake Martyrs and make it SO much better than the original".I've read somewhere that the directors had no intentions of implementing a lot of graphic violence in this version, instead they were going to carry over the 'mood and elements' of the original film...really?! I can say with certainty this version did incorporate violent scenes, yes violent... but not even close to the brutality, vicious, eerie, creepy, cringe worthy moments of the original.The directors even had the audacity to throw in a (semi) happy ending?! I'll go as far to say that this film could've been considered a 'Lifetime' movie of the week if they removed one scene, or done a off camera shot to imply what was going on, which by the way was done throughout the film during the torture scenes. We're also supplied with a cute little back story of how 'Anna and Lucie' become friends as little girls, of which I didn't feel helped the film at all.In my opinion the performances were an insult to the original. I felt nothing for our protagonists in this film, nothing whatsoever. Watching the original Martyrs, as the viewer you felt all sorts of emotions, most of which were pain, terror and fear, OK 'pain' is not an actual emotion, but you did feel the pain actress Myl?ne Jampano? from the original, had exhibited in Martyrs (2008).In closing, I'm not going to tell anyone NOT to see the film, we all love or like movies. I love watching movies of all genres, and I knew I was going to watch (Martyrs 2015) when it came out. I didn't expect it to be better than the original, maybe I was hoping it would've been a nice little compliment to the 2008 version. But it wasn't.Note the film was a NOT a shot for shot remake, thank God. But I'll bet anything as you're watching it, you'll say to yourself, where's this, what happened to the part when...etc etc. If you've never seen the original...see it, before you view this film and think you've just seen a fantastic horror film. Because I know some numskull will view this version of Martyrs, who never seen the original and think they watched a good or even great horror film, people are weird like that.Lastly...hey Hollywood...please leave original bad*** classics alone! These films stand on their own. Didn't anyone in Hollywood learn from the remade 'Oldboy' afterbirth of a film??? Kevin Goetz and Michael Goetz (Martyrs 2015)...nice try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original film is one of my favorite horror movies, so I went in with very low expectations. I was very nervous to watch a remake, especially of a film that was so brutal, heart wrenching, and yet beautiful at the same time. Even though I had low expectations, I was still disappointed. They changed too much, and it wasn't as beautifully done, or as brutal as I expected. If I had never seen the original I may have actually enjoyed this one more. This is one of those movies is recommended to people that enjoy American horror movies, and don't want to read subtitles. But if you love horror movies, and don't mind reading a little, then this one would be a let down to all of the amazing foreign films out there.</fullReview>

First it's not in French.. Which alone destroys all sense of horrible beauty, that helped make the original so captivating. Country effing music.!, you have got to be kidding. Everyone associated with this film should be barred from ever doing anything in life but sweeping horse poo from the back of a carriage on rainy nites.. Scene after scene stolen from the original and twisted into unrecognizable pig shite.. The problem with most American actors is that they're so bloody transparent and unbelievably bad actors.. Since I turned it off at after 5 minutes.. I have nothing else to add to this review.. Except.. Do not waste good air on this crap or anything else from these directors..

		<shortDescription>Martyrs (2015)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though I watched the original Martyrs various years ago, it's a film which is impossible to forget. That's why I knew beforehand that its North American remake would never reach the same levels of violence, intensity and anguish reached by the French version... something I would have tolerated if co-directors Kevin and Michael Goetz had respected the spirit of that brilliant film and its overwhelming atmosphere of cruelty and hopelessness. Unfortunately, that was the first thing which got lost in this "light" version, which could basically be considered "PG-13" if it wasn't for some moderately bloody scenes, which could have been eliminated without any problem, because they don't fix all the things which were decomposed in this diluted interpretation. And that's where my comparison between both versions ends because, to be fair, Martyrs (2008) didn't receive too much diffusion, and I estimate that Martyrs (2015) will be a novelty for many spectators, so I will do my best to evaluate it on its own merits. I found it a bad film, but I will at least grant it that courtesy. To start with, I found the screenplay of Martyrs (2015) poorly written, specially during the second half, when something happens which brusquely alters the premise and introduces absurd concepts, until getting to an insipid conclusion. Among the very few positive things I can say about this remake, I can mention the decent performances from Troian Bellisario and Bailey Noble. Despite them, I found Martyrs (2015) an absolute waste of time. Even taking it as an individual horror film, it's an absolute failure. Anyway... I hope the next step isn't some remake of ? l'intérieur suitable for the family schedule of Lifetime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made for people who can't be bothered to read subtitles.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And that's the only reason I can think of as to why anybody would even begin to think of remaking, re-imagining, cashing in on an out of the blue, fresh, sadistic horror that really had a lasting effect.And it's made for those people who balk at the idea of watching a movie with subtitles (we all know someone who won't watch a subtitled film, and to be honest, I feel so sorry for them, as they are missing some of the best pieces of cinema ever made).And lets not forget, it's also a good way to cash in on an already successful film, because there are sadists out there who want to see how much they have ruined a film they genuinely love (and believe me, I paid to see the recent Point Break remake.....Point fake if you would).So if you haven't seen the wonderful original, stop reading this and do yourself a favour. Or if you are one of those ignorant people, shame on you and the plot goes along these lines....Ten-year-old Lucie flees from an isolated warehouse where she has been held prisoner. Deeply traumatised, she is plagued by night terrors at the orphanage that takes her in.Her only comfort comes from Anna, a girl her own age. Nearly a decade later and still traumatised, she finally tracks down the people that tortured her.As she and Anna move closer to the truth, they find themselves trapped in a nightmare that resembles her past trauma, and if they cannot escape, the titular fate awaits them....It's a very pointless remake, and it's directed lazily, with poor performances from most of the cast. Bellisario and Noble are quite good as the titular characters, but the material that they are given just resorts them to screaming and looking in shock for the majority of the second and third act.The originals final act was shocking, the narrative really came into it's own, and it was explained to great lengths, which enhanced the quite sinister subject matter.Here, it's explained quite briefly by a fourth rate Meryl Streep wannabe, and when the 'money shot' is finally upon us, your already getting your copy of the original Blu Ray out of it's case and ready to put in your machine.It's not a very good film, it's lazily made, and despite the two leads putting in okay performances, the rest of the cast bring them down.See the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less violence, less emotion, less quality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of the French 2008 movie "Martyrs", I had strong doubts about the quality and necessity of a remake. Still I tried to push all those negative feelings aside and give the movie a fair shot. Like the original, it starts out when the young girl Lucy escapes from a terrible situation unknown to the viewer. She lands in an orphanage where she meets her best friend Anna while being haunted from the past. Ten years later, Lucy kills a family claiming they are her former capturers. One aspect I love about the French version is, it basically consists of two stories with the turnaround in the middle of the movie. The remake adapts the first half of the film more or less faithfully though clearly worse than the original and the second half deviates completely from it. With those drastic changes it feels more like one consisting story rather than two. They tried to create a new story instead of copying the French movie shot for shot and the attempt of doing so I appreciate about it. Still the second part fells illogical and is a mess. For me it does not work and felt even cheesy sometimes. The acting is not exceptional but also not terrible. It has some beautifully shot scenes but there is some shaky cam in it which is bothering. Furthermore the movie is a lot less violent and gory which basically is okay but leads to some illogical moments in the second half. Also there are some genuinely boring moments considering the short running time and overall it is a lot less emotional than Pascal Laugier's Martyrs. Especially an aspect from Lucy's struggle with the past is left unresolved and you care a lot less about her. Over all, I think someone who has not seen the French version or does not like extremely brutal movies can watch this toned down version and might actually enjoy it for its story. Fans of the New French Extremity masterpiece should stay away from the remake and everybody else I clearly advise to check out the former one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remakes Suck, The Original Film was an Untouchable Classic...blah blah blah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that almost every review of this movie on here starts out the same way. Some hipster amateur critic proclaims the original French MARTYRS to be one of the greatest horror films ever put on celluloid, a work of genius. Then, they go on to say how useless remakes are because they desecrate their beloved film that 12 people saw. Finally, we get to how stupid Americans are and how watered down this remake is compared to the original. Sound about right?I'll start by saying that I was not really enamored of the original film. Yes, there were some really great things about it. It was also pretentious and needlessly vague. It was extreme gore trying to mask itself in a cloak of symbolism. For many horror films weaned on mindless slasher films, any movie with a glimmer of a message is automatically hailed as genius just because it attempts to rise above the kill count style of horror. Even if you do agree that the original is a classic of the genre, is it really fair to compare all remakes to the original? I understand that this is natural, but also feel that a film should be judged on its' own merits, much the same as I never felt it fair to compare a movie to a written source, like a novel. They are two separate works. Ask yourself honestly, what would I think of this movie had I never seen the original?I still don't think that makes this American version of MARTYRS a great movie, but I also don't think that it's nearly as terrible as some of these ratings want you to believe. The movie does retain a number of key scenes from Laugier's original, while also making numerous changes, some of which work and some of which definitely warrant the "American films suck" bashing. We start off with our heroine escaping from confinement and torture, with no exposition to explain what has occurred. The film allows the backstory to unravel as it progresses and we are given glimpses into the young girl's ordeal. What follows next is one of the weaknesses of the movie, as we spend a lot of time meeting two young girls as they develop their friendship. Yet, it fails on most counts. Despite the directors' attempts to make us sympathize with these girls, I never found it to have enough impact that I did ultimately care. More explanation of her torture earlier in the film may have helped, as it focuses instead on the neurosis that she suffers in the present tense, which plays out with typical bad jump scares and visions of a generic "monster" which really have nothing to do with anything else that occurs in the movie, except to inject some horror into the early parts of the filmWe fast forward to "modern day" as the young woman storms a house, murdering the entire family. From here, the plot starts to unveil itself, the action ramps up and things start moving along rapidly. There are some moments of genuinely quality film here, as our heroine realizes that this vengeance has still not cleared her of her demons. She calls her best friend, who comes to the rescue and must decide whether to call the police, or help her obviously crazy friend. The movie feels like it's going somewhere, but then the villains show up and the movie starts to descend into cliché. We get bad action style scenes and a generic chase that ends exactly as we knew it would.Now that the girls have been caught, we get a villainess straight out of James Bond or Batman comics, spending far too much time explaining her ridiculous plot in mundane detail. It's almost a counterbalance of the original. Where the French version left too much unexplained, the American version goes to great lengths to make sure we understand completely, spelling it out for us. It's too much and takes away any tension built up prior.Now, the torture begins again, ultimately leading to the climax that shares a lot with the original. These scenes are toned down, but not so much that they don't have some visceral impact. Unfortunately, the directors make an odd choice to go with a weird, happy ending that feels out of place in the movie and doesn't work.In the end, the remake never does anything to really sink its' teeth into the viewer and have an impact. However, it also has a lot of good moments. It's an average horror film in a world full of average horror films. It's better than the glut of z grade garbage that fills streaming sites like Nflix, but will never be worth a rewatch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loving the original I knew most likely I was going to hate this one. I spent 13$ to own it on demand which I will never recoup. It started off close to shot to shot, which would have made it a little better. But the original hits you and the guts and takes you for a ride the whole movie leaving you emotionally drained at the end. Jennifer Lawrence might has well be Anna. All that said I'll continue to watch remakes just like I loved to watch Stephen King movies after reading the book knowing id get the same results. So if your like me. Your probably reading this after the fact feeling the same way. Also, such a quick flaccid ending ugh</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>will hopefully draw new audiences to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am literally watching this as I write this review. I started writing about ten minutes in, and finished rolling the credits, because I kept getting gripped to the screen. Never written a review before, but as this is a remake of one of my faves, I felt I should cast an opinion. I always want to encourage the appreciation of art, so I'm not going to Crap on the remake just because the original is so good.Firstly, as I said, I love the original, in my top 5 and one of the films I drop when people fancy themselves as a movie buff, or a horror enthusiast. To which I usually get a blank response. The original is so well shot. To me its like the director is flaunting his competence of all styles of horror. Not to fulfill an ego, but to purposely mislead the watcher into thinking they are in a 'style' of horror they know, creating a sense of security, only to be pulled out of it into another style over and over. Creating constant disorientation and confusion. A perfect state to have your audience as a horror director. It starts with themes of confinement, containment and abuse only to fast forward a month to crap you up with a weird creature tormenting the previously abused. Is it real? Is it in her head? Confusion. Then, fast forward again, ten years, and a seemingly nice suburban family get absolutely point blank shotgun massacred. Revenge style. Then this sense of 'what have I done' fear is construed, Yet again a different type of horror\fear is achieved. Next is the fear Lucy's going to kill Anna because she doesn't believe her actions were just. But yet again a switch in styles as the girls find out Lucy was right and the family ARE sadistic torturers. Now the fear of escape grips you as the torturers appear and chase them down. Alas, they get caught and locked up and tortured, the fear of confinement, containment and abuse come full circle. Very clever. She's tortured to the brink of death to satisfy the torturous cults obsession with finding a glimpse of what the afterlife holds. Then at that brink of death, she whispers into the cult leaders ear, unheard by the audience, to which the leader responds by committing suicide. Leaving you lost, confused, appalled and bewildered. The ending is what you make of it, the smartest way to end a horror, because the meaning is left for the fear they have filled you with to answer! Personally I like to think that she told the cult leader that death is bliss for all, which is why she instantly kills herself, when really hell exists for the wicked! Her only way to win in a horrific circumstance. Now the remake doesn't seem effortlessly skip between styles like the original, to create the same affect. But the overall mood of the film is well emulated. Its shot in that indie arty American style that i do enjoy. Which reminds you that not American film is super polished and idiot proof. But then again, it does answer questions that are far more satisfying when left to be figured out by the viewer. Some really nice shots and pacing to start with. The tension is dragged very skillfully throughout. The ending was changed, but I think it had to be believable in an American setting. Maybe the point of the originals ending was lost a little, but as I said, the meaning of the originals ending is left to the individual viewers thought path. Obviously the remakes director was left with the notion portrayed in his remake. Overall, definitely watch this, if you haven't seen the original, this will make you want to. If you have seen the original, then maybe this will entice new audiences to watch it too. Then at least you have someone to talk about how sick it is with! Not a bad remake. Let the right one instead remake is better. Point break's is so much worse!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I started to watch this version of Martyrs, without actually expecting any greatness. I had already seen the original version, and knew that any remake would probably be very poor. To be honest, this version isn't too bad in its own right as a horror flick, and Troian Bellisarios acting did surprise me somewhat. She played a pretty good part considering she's only really used to Pretty Little Liars. But alas, the original kinda blows this version out of the park. As the story barely mirrors the original, both in content and delivery. And I'd say most of the actual horror scenes or incidents are completely different too. If you do want to watch it then please watch the original first... You'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never before have I felt so compelled to write a movie review after watching a film as I did post-screening of the Martyrs remake. Negative reviews will not keep me from seeing something of interest, and this is true for the American version of Martyrs. For the record I have absolutely no connection to anyone involved in the making of this movie, so what follows is a completely objective, unbiased opinion.The American remake of Martyrs is an above-average horror movie. There, I said it. All the devoted fans of the original who despise this remake can kiss my kiester. This is a quality, well-made film that looks and sounds fantastic and features professional acting performances from each member of the cast. That right there puts it miles ahead of so many really crappy horror movies that are out there. Then the original story-line was massaged and adjusted for the purposes of the remake, and in my opinion it created a different, intriguing, enjoyable Martyrs experience for horror audiences worldwide. Is it perfect? Heck no. Is it better than the original French version? Nope. But is it a worthwhile remake that took the same basic ingredients as the original yet crafted its own recipe? It sure is! I can see myself revisiting both versions of this particular title, and enjoying each on its own merits, and I recommend that you do the same. In fact, watch the remake first (kind of like a Martyrs appetizer) and then settle in for the main course, the original French version with English subtitles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Martyrs (2015) ** (out of 4)A young girl named Lucie escapes from being held hostage and struggles to fit in at the orphanage she's sent. She eventually becomes best friends with a girl named Sam. Flash forward ten years and Lucie (Troian Bellisario) kills the people she feels was responsible for her capture and asks Sam (Caitlin Carmichael) for some help but things take a deadly turn.The 2008 French film of the same name was known for its brutality and it certainly lived up to its reputation as one of the most graphic movies to be made up to that point. This American remake isn't nearly as awful as some people are making it out to be but there's no doubt that it isn't nearly as entertaining as the original. With that said, there are some major issues here but it's really neither awful or good.I think the biggest problem with the film is that it's just not all that entertaining. If you've seen the original then you're obviously going to know what's going on but the changes in the story really don't make too much sense but even worse is that it's just downright boring at times. I'm really not sure what it is but I never once really cared for either of the lead characters. Even worse is that if you don't care for them there's really nothing to root for.The violence here is pretty strong but not nearly as graphic as the original movie. For the most part it's a technically well-made film and features two good performances from the leads. I really thought Carmichael was good in her part. Another good thing is the music score but in all reality that's about it. MARTYRS, the American version, isn't awful by any stretch of the imagination but the filmmakers just didn't do enough to make this stand up on its own.</fullReview>

I do have to say it has been at least 5 years ago since i seen the original, and i do recommend not watching them after one other in a short amount of time. Luci of course reminded me all the time of her character in pretty little liars, but that didn't really bug me, in fact it suited her well because both characters are full of conspiracy theories. The movies kept my interest and surprised me with some twists. Over all the acting was done very well, it has been at least as painful to watch as the original.(in a good way) It deserves a way better rating then it has now!!</fullReview>

Did people really expect so much that they are so disappointed now?While this film isn't as good as the original one, it was better than I, personally, expected from a remake. I hate most Hollywood remakes. The original, French, version was more shocking and somewhat darker, true, but this one has its own little details that I found worth seeing.I liked the actresses who played the lead roles; they look convincing and they made me sympathise with the characters, which doesn't happen often with the characters in a film of this genre. The general atmosphere isn't bad either. It did make me feel the hopelessness of the situation the girls found themselves trapped in.Not brilliant, but I don't regret watching this film. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, yes, I have seen the original and it still haunts me to this day, and I watch a lot of movies...but the opening of the original is just brutal...and we know that won't fly in USA movies, thanks to censors, so it is not right to really compare this to the original, that could never be done here...so I did not go into this expecting to the see the original movie "remade"...it will never be done and does not need to be.So, from my point of view, this was not a horrible movie...I did not come out of this feeling I had wasted the time I spent watching this. The story is a little more fleshed out in this one without all the torture scenes of the first one and it was made to reflect our current times and the location of it. Not a bad movie at all, and I do still prefer the original...nothing will ever touch the way the original makes me feel to this day...BUT, I don't think this movie deserves all the trash talk it gets...there are so many "bad" horror movies out there that are a lot worse than this was.Overall, not bad, just don't expect the original, it could never be made in an American movie. I definitely think it was worth the watch, it was done well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Horror" for feeble-minded, vegetarian children. That is what this hollower-than-thou exercise in redundancy is. The funny thing is that the absolutely worthless directors behind this abomination calls this a re-imagining and not a remake. Let's face it, even though it's not a shot-by-shot remake, it still reeks to high heaven with the stink of remake all over it. But hey, by all means, call it a re-imagining instead and see if replacing a word with another actually makes any difference at all. Yeah, if you "reimagine", it almost sounds like you have genuine artistic vision and integrity. What a joke. The really sad thing is that this feeble filth would never have been made in the first place if Pascal Laugier hadn't had a momentary lapse of reason. Instead he decided in an absolute fit of ( greedy? ) insanity that his pearly vision of wounds and nothingness should be fondled and mangled by swinish hands, his diamond turned into simple glass.From deep existential philosophy in the spirit of Bataille, themes of the wordless suffering behind our words, non- knowledge in the immanent to this; a Hallmark soap-opera pretending to actually have a truly horrifying impact?!! Ha, ha,just sad. What the hell was he thinking?!!Every single aspect of this stillborn deformity is without any worth whatsoever, the perfected darkness you felt throughout the original is completely absent here, the profound suffering that screamed at you from every frame in the original is here replaced with cardboard characters, middle-of-the road actors that you know just puts on a momentary show of pain. Pain made palatable for the brain-dead children, pain made presentable enough to sell tickets. No real substance and no real darkness to be found here. Move on.In short, the one and only Martyrs was made in 2008. End of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Rare Fans Of The Original That Liked It.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike most others, I welcome horror movie remakes. I know that most end up being trash. But there are the few that end up being decent horror movies in their own merit. Yes, I'm a fan of the original 2008 French film Martyrs. I mean I really loved the intense raw terror of the original mixed. But like most have said, it wasn't just about the terror. It had deep meaning. Which is why it has become one of the biggest horror cult classics of the past 20 years. So when I heard that they were making an American remake, I was honestly excited. The producers promised to keep the intensity of the original. This announcement was way back in 2010. So you can imagine I've been waiting nearly 6 years for this. Now the film is finally here. I will admit that the trailer for the film released online made it look very mediocre. And I knew that most other fans of the original would trash the film relentlessly regardless of its true value. It is hard to not compare this to the original. The critics reviews seem implausible too. I guess I'm the rare fan of the original that actually liked it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Martyrs, An American Re-imagining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoilers will be for both the 2008 French version and of course The 2015 American Version*In 2008, Most die hard Horror fans will all know about the French Masterpiece entitled "Martyrs". In 2015 we where presented by a re-imagining rather than a "remake" of the original. Those who have seen and loved the 2008 French Martyrs, have given this 2015 version some harsh and unsatisfied reviews. I have watched the 2008 a number of times. I had watched this one 2 times. I understand that there is a very different way about the movie between both versions. 2008 has been a very brutal, gruesome, twisted yet beautiful tale of a Cult of people seeking knowledge of the "Afterlife". This includes finding a "Martyr" to endure unbearable pain and suffering in order to fulfill the cult's quest for further knowledge. Same with the 2015 version. The violent content and torture sequences in the 2008 are highly graphic and disturbing. The 2015, has much less graphic depictions of torture but still sends the message to the viewer. As you probably know, the 2008 original was not a very happy ending. 2015 takes the story and twists the end in a surprising way. If you, like me, love to see a person that is victimized, come back and get revenge on those who wronged them, the 2015 version is for you. But i have to say, Watch the original first!! You will appreciate the ending more if you watch the 2008 before you watch the 2015. I give this movie a 7/10. Yes it is "watered down" but still enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent horror movie, sans raison d'etre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally I start my reviews with a short synopsis, but when it comes to Martyrs, the less you know going in, the better. So let's skip it. It's a horror movie, disturbing and gory, and there's a good amount of torture, but there's no sexual violence. That should be enough for you to know if it's compatible with your blood type.But none of that matters. Don't watch it.This is a remake of a movie that should be on every top ten list of post-millennial horror. Laugier's 2008 original version was not a perfect movie, but what it did well, it did better than any movie before or since. If you haven't seen it, your only excuse is that you can't handle that level of horror. The one thing that's kept it out of the consciousness of some is that it's in French.Thus the remake. It worked for Let The Right One In; why not Martyrs? The big part is because, as I wrote, this is a movie where the story and its surprises matter. The original is a film that knocks your feet from you before you realize the film's even begun. While there are a few changes in this remake, they're mostly insignificant. If you watch the inferior English version first, you'll forever be ruined for the original masterpiece. And if you've already watched the original, this remake holds nothing new for you, just a remade, Spit On Your Grave revenge-story climax that trades Laugier's moody ambiguity for American splatter.It's a shame. On its own, Goetz &amp; Goetz's Martyrs is not a bad film. Production values are high and fewer clichés exist than are typical in horror. Elements that made the original great are visible, if through murk. But this was the wrong film to remake. There is only one reason to watch this, and that would be if you lack any tolerance for subtitles. If that's the case, you have my permission and you have my pity.</fullReview>

It was brutal flick back then were the whole horror community was speaking about and let me say, people will speak of this one again. Why there are so many haters walking around and why it has a low rating is an enigma for me. For a US remake this is also a brutal flick with a few gory and creepy moments. it didn't shock me like the original did but still it's straight in your face. For people not common with horror this can be shocking. For the gore hounds I must say that the gore as seen in the French version is left out but still it can offend some. This remake was top notch for me, just like the Evil Dead (2013) remake it wasn't made PG wise. Finally not a Hollywood teen remake, excellent..Gore 2,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not watered down as they say...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a crazy horror fan, but I'll admit I usually don't watch anything that is not in English. So I have only brought myself to see bits and pieces of the original movie, which I can understand why people are crazy about. However, while watching this movie I did not see a problem with it as some people do. I think the criticisms are way too tough when comparing it to the original. You have to give some credit to the writers for trying and succeeding in switching up the story from the other version. And you have to give credit towards the actors in this movie as well. The two female leads did a great job, in my opinion. As for the story, the beginning dragged on for me. I actually watched this late at night when I was tired and fell asleep within the first 20 minutes. The next morning I started the movie off at the twenty minute mark and was captivated until the ending credits. I'm really not a tough critic as I just watch movies to enjoy them and have a great time while watching. The only thing that stopped me from a higher rating was probably the beginning sequence, just because with all the changes to this movie, I actually don't feel the whole beginning story was necessary. As for the blood and gore, I'm getting annoyed by people saying this is a watered down 'PG-13' version. Please tell me ONE movie that is rated PG-13 that has a gruesome torture scene like this movie. And language also. Maybe you can say watered down from the original as that was over the top, but this is definitely deserving of its R rating. With all that said, just enjoy the movie for what it is! I can guarantee if the original was not made and this was a stand alone, people would be RAVING about this movie.</fullReview>

Now that I've watched it, I came back here and saw that if you scroll down the reviews page, at least there are several other people who thought this movie was excellent as well. This was the BEST HORROR movie I've seen in a long time, blows everything I've seen in the theaters for the past year away. Why is this movie not getting more attention and making a TON of money?? I'll never understand studios decisions, it should have been a theatrical wide release for sure.I have to warn you though, this movie is not for the faint of heart. It is very gory and for fans of horror/thriller movies. So if you like this genre, do yourself a favor and watch this movie and let you be the judge of what the rating should be!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this with low expectations having been burnt by the old 'American remake of a European great' before. Yes I too love the original and did find it hard to stop making comparisons to it. Once I managed to accept this film on its own merit and enjoy the slightly different direction it was going in, I had a great time with it.Slightly watered down from the 08 classic but for gods sake - what was ever going to match that in brutality, Still a worthy addition to any horror fans collection or a great view for a movie night with friends when you feel like a good scare (yes this still has a high level of tension and scares).All up a 7/10 and I say turn off your movie snob meter and just enjoy the fun horror ride that follows. I've not mentioned the plot because if you've got this far you already know what the film is about I'm just here to tell you to give it a go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A little girl escapes from some form of captivity. Next day cops arrive at the location and find nothing. A month later the girl named Lucy is in an orphanage and is befriended by another girl Anna. But Lucy has nightmares and sees monsters. Cops interview Anna trying to find out if there was something to what Lucy told them. Lucy and Anna become very close.Ten years later Lucy takes revenge on a upper class family. She calls Anna who arrives and is shocked by what she sees. But in order for it all to be over, Lucy has to cleanse the place because she's still haunted by a monster. But there's a twist and we do find out what's going on with the monster.While looking for something Anna finds a secret passageway, a ladder downstairs, and indeed, several torture chambers. She tries to free a little girl who's being held. But then a bunch of people arrive and they girls are grabbed.Now they are all in torture chambers. Anna is tested for something but she fails. A woman leader of the group comes clean and tells her what they are all about. Lucy is special, she's the one who will be able to tell them a secret...once she's suffered enough. When she orders some henchman to take care of Anna, things don't turn out as planned.Martyrs 2015 breaks two of my rules for a remake: it's only been 7 years since the original and not several decades. What purpose would a remake serve? And why on earth aren't great foreign movies dubbed into English for those who can't be bothered to read? The other rule it breaks is that the original is perfect, the greatest horror movie ever made, in my view. In what way could the filmmakers behind this one hope to improve on the original? Add to that the usual problems that resulted in this version ending up an independent movie and you have a recipe for a disaster.And yet Martyrs 2015 isn't a disaster. It's pretty good actually. Nothing is gained by comparing it to the original, because, well, it isn't the original. If you want to see the original, see it. If you want to see a different version then see this one. Or better yet, see both.The first 40 minutes are very strong here. You do connect with the two little girls. There are several touching moments, and a couple of creepy one as well. Once the adult Lucy exacts revenge things stay strong. It's when the secret group arrives that things go downhill a bit. That's when our actresses get a chance to show their acting chops and unfortunately they fail, in particular Bellisario.This movie looks good, it's very bright and occasionally beautiful. The music is excellent. Overall, it's a faithful remake that honors the original. Some sets look identical. It's a shorter movie that focuses more on the childhood of the girls and their friendship and far, far less on torture and brutality. Not sure what rating this is but it could very well be a harder PG-13. It also focuses a bit more on the organization and the creepy lady behind it all. The ending is different, but offers an enjoyable alternative.Among remakes, most of which are just crap, this one is among the better ones, perhaps even the best. If you haven't seen Martyrs 2008, do yourself a favor and see it and prepare to be blown away. Once you have, or if you have seen it already, then ignore the exaggerated negative reviews of this movie and give it chance. Yes, it's not unforgettable, nor mind-blowing, but if you can set aside fruitless comparisons, you won't be entirely disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first watched this movie and really enjoyed it. Not only did the actors did a great job, but also the music and the last 10 minutes of the movie. Everything just floated perfectly! I've read many reviews about this movie and I think most people just give it 1 star because it is a remake. But I don't believe that's fair. People shouldn't rate a movie based on that but should do it simply based on quality of this movie. I think it is unfair. This movie is one of the best movies I have ever watched. The ending was very emotional and the original I watched later on didn't even come close. The torture level in the original one was way over the top! In this remake there isn't that much torture but the acting and music are so good that it hurts even more, simply no need to torture like hell, their eyes say enough. Probs to the makers, great job !!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most people, the word "remake" makes me roll my eyes. Especially remakes of great movies. Then you get some studio drama, a low budget, and the movie eventually landing in the hands of some unknown directors and an unfamiliar cast, how can anyone get excited? A word first about the original. No other movie has made an impact on me in my adult life like Martyrs. It is a stunning movie. The best in horror, and also among the very best movies, period. Perhaps this then makes my review and the reviews of others entirely unfair, while reviews by those who haven't seen the original could be more useful.So of course I approached this remake with some skepticism. Think of all the cringe-worthy remakes of Poltergeist, Nightmare on Elm Street, the countless remakes/reboots of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, movies with a large studio backing and relatively good budgets. They are all efficient but not effective and don't come close to doing the original justice. Even the admired and gory Evil Dead remake fell flat in my view.From the get-go you can tell that Martyrs isn't going to be an embarrassment. They take the original seriously and capture some of the intimacy Laugier is so proficient at creating between the audience and the characters. The character of Anna, both young and adult, is particularly likable since she's just a normal girl. Lucy, understandably, is distant. And not enough effort is made to make us sympathize with her. The revenge scene is well done. The monster haunting Lucy not so much, it's more monstrous than human.The second act, once the girls are captured of course doesn't match the original. It's abbreviated and sanitized. That too makes us feel less for Lucy. So instead we are quickly taken to the final act. It does borrow some of the great aspects from the original but adds something new. There was no emotional payoff in the original, it was entirely intellectual, which made things rather bleak and hopeless. Here the intellectual aspect is maintained but a more emotionally satisfying resolution is added.There was always the possibility that an American remake of Martyrs would be more mean-spirited, colder, nastier, perhaps even more explicit. However, this remake is the opposite. Both with the coloring and the emotional tone the filmmakers made a warmer Martyrs that eschews the relentless violence. As a result you have a film that is nowhere as horrific and doesn't make much of an impact. Nevertheless, this remake worked in its own way. Consider it an appetizer for the original. If it does get more people to see Laugier's brilliant tour de force masterpiece then it will have accomplished something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't agree with the other viewers at all.. Best movie I've seen in a long time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay so I am a movie fanatic and I have seen almost every scary movie and damn near about every other genre as well. I thought this was the original when I watched it and I have been trying to see that one for years, however have not been able to find it. Let me say for someone who has not seen the first one (which is why most of the reviewers said they hated this one) but this movie was soooo good!!! I will be recommending it to everyone. It was a little hard to watch as it was really intense and just crazy. This movie has a totally unique plot line and great acting. It is definitely a must see if you like the horror genre. At the end when everything came together I just sat there for a minute thinking "that was such a good movie".. If you like things that are out of the box and just a thrill to watch this is it. I am still trying to find the old one so I can watch it however I am scared it going to be way to gory for me as this one even almost got turned off and I am not squeamish at all.. But this is a MUST SEE!!</fullReview>
