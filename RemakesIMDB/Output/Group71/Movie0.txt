		<shortDescription>awesome movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classmates is a smartly packaged film that shows the importance of a good script. Director Lal Jose has made a great entertainer which tugs your heart strings and features lesser mortals. The film opens with a retired college professor Iyer and his wife a retired Chemistry professor trying to organize a get-together of the 1991 batch of students. This meeting is also in memory of their only son who died under mysterious circumstances during his final year. The actors look and act real. Pritviraj as Sukumaran is an absolute delight to watch. Watch out for his romance with Kavya. Jayasurya is simply great in comedy and he walks away with some of the best one-liners in the film. Indrajeet as Pious is a revelation and Kavya comes out with a fine portrayal. But it is the new girl Radhika who steals the show in the suspense laden climax. The supporting cast of veterans are all brilliant even though in small roles. Classmates can be included in the list of all-time great campus stories in Malayalam.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>review - classmates</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the teaser scene of the movie you see Sukumaran (Prithviraj) chasing Sateeshan (Jayasurya) along the campus. Finally Sukumaran catches him and beats him to pulp. Someone throws him a hockey stick and as he is about to kill Sateeshan, someone shouts that their friend Murali (Sunil) is found dead in the generator room. Suku wakes up from his dream and gets ready to go back to Kerala from Mumbai for a reunion among those classmates. The reunion of the 1991 Chemistry batch was organized by Prof. Iyer (Balachandra Menon) and his wife (Sobha Mohan) in memory of their son Murali. The plan was to have a get together in the evening, recollect memories, stay in the hostel for the night and leave in the morning. Besides Sukumaran who is now a diamond merchant the other people who arrive are Sateeshan, who is an MLA, Pius (Indrajith), who is now in Gulf, Thara Kurup (Kavya Madhavan) who is a professional dancer and Raziya (Radhika). As they arrive one by one, both Thara and Sateeshan give a hostile looks to Sukumaran and you know something is not right. His only friend is Pius, but since his daughter was sick, Pius leaves to see a doctor at night at the insistence of Thara. As Suku is drunk and lying in the hostel room at night, Prof. Iyer comes to meet him and talk about Murali and his guitar which Iyer kept in another room. That night when Pius returns he finds Suku is strangled by the guitar string and police comes to investigate. Suku was not dead and he is moved to the ICU. The police meanwhile find his diary in which he had written that he wanted to end his life, but before that he wanted to go back to his past one last time. Iyer does not believe that it is suicide. He walks along with Pius and tells that to understand the present, we have to go back into the past. The movie then flash backs to 1991.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Campus movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film depicts the campus life of a 1991 batch of students in flash back. It revolves around the suicide/ murder attempt on the hero of the film ( Prithviraj Sumumaran as P Sukumaran) during a college reunion 15 years afterwards. The campus politics, rivalry and the violence in a campus in Kerala is portrayed nicely. The real hero of the film is its script and direction. The performance of the cast is believable. The songs are meaningful and apt for the movie. The best part in the movie is of course the climax. The actor (Radhika) and the voice behind( Bhagyalakshmi I think) render the intensity which I found to be riveting. It is one of the must watch film in Malayalam language and probably the best so far in campus thriller genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Classmates' is a well directed story that captivates one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Classmates' is truly one of those movies that make a great impact on the viewers. The new age actors of the Malayalam film industry like Prithviraj, Indrajith, Naren etc have done a wonderful job. It's also a great relief to see that movies like this can be well made without involving the veteran actors. Special accolades should be credited to the strong screenplay and a beautifully done direction by Lal Jose. The songs in 'Classmates' are very romantic and also contains a well written lyrics. The story goes on to tell about the story of a batch of classmates who reunite 15 years after their graduation in a get-together. Unfortunately one of the classmate had undergone a suspicious death during their college days. The story progresses as to tell us how this mysterious death takes place. The climax of this movie is so beautifully shot that it lasts in the memory for long. The female actors like Kavya Madhavan and the débutante actor Radhika have performed their roles really well. Overall, i would say that this movie should definitely be watched by every Malayalam film lovers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its all about nostalgia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems yet another girl deserted Pazhanthuni. A weeping pazhanthuni finds relief in the eternal love song of malayalam, 'Sanyansinee Nin' which is sung exclusively for him by college's pet singer Murali. Murali who can not say no to anybody, obliges and reminds him that this third of this kind. The humour in this scene is not so loud or slapstick as we were experiencing in recent malayalam movies. Puzhanthuni, who just has hardly 4 to 5 dialogues in the entire movie is still fresh in the memories of viewers. Thats the beauty of this film.The batch of 1991 decides to meet at old college campus after a long gap of 15 years. Many of them are changed. Some of them has achieved a lot, some still struggling, some married and some are not, and some of them are looking forward to this meeting with their own ambitions. Then there is flashback of their old college days where fierce election was fought between two rival groups, which brings about a lot of freshness, humour and nostalgia. The strength of the movie lies in the script and direction which unveils a murder mystery in an untold fashion. Everybody connected with this film is giving their best performance so far. Be it is Lal Jose the director, Pritviraj the protagonist, Kavya, Sunil, Indrajith or the newcomers Rasiya and scriptwriter Alex Paul. The songs were just too melodious and it has already became a huge craze among the youth. One heartening thing about this movie is the acceptance of young actors by the viewers of Kerala, at a time when the industry was sticking only to Mammootty and Mohanlal, the superstars of malayalam cinema. It is the first genuine hit for Pritviraj, whose career was under scanner for a while. Reports say that it has already became a cult-classic in malayalam film history. It has broken the all-time collection records, and still going strong. Don't miss this movie, its a movie for lifetime.</fullReview>
