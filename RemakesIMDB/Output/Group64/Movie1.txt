		<shortDescription>Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderful comedy and a typically french amour. Vincent Cassel and Francoise Cluzet as two fathers in their 40ies who spent their holidays with their teenage daughters in the sunny south of France.First the daughters don't like the idea of spending their summer holidays in a house in the Provence but things change.Lola Le Lann as Cluzets film daughter Louna is charming, beautiful, charismatic and a real wonderful actress with a great future in the business. Her character Louna fells in love with the best friend of her father (Cassel) after they spent a night on the beach together. While the elder man tries to forget what happened on the beach the girl is in love for the first time. She is wonderful when she tries to seduce Cassel and even her suffering after he rejects her in the next days is very much believable. The funniest moments in this film has Francois Cluzet when he goes hunting the wild boars who ruin his garden but never gets them.Alice Isaaz as Marie, Lounas best friend, gives also an impressive performance.If you love funny and emotional films this one is a must-see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best French movies I watched this summer.Had to do it in chunks, though: the emotions were so overwhelming I had to stop my player every 15 minutes or so just to catch my breath.I dunno, probably it's because of my age (about 50, male) that I relate so closely to that story.Certain scenes and dialogs seem a bit exaggerated but that's French comedy for you. Snobish movie critics can boil their head but I don't regret for a minute that I spent well over two hours watching it; will recommend it to all my buddies.On a side note: After seeing the movie, it would be probably a good idea to read the interview with Vincent Cassel (Paris Match #3449, Jun 25 - Jul 01, 2015, pp.9-11) where he talks about his character in that film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated premise and fairly tedious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this at the french Film Festival in Sydney, 2016. I always go to see anything Francois Cluzet is in, but am afraid this year he disappointed. He seemed to be sleep-walking through this. I found the situations he was depicted in fairly tedious and not funny at all, though it is billed as a comedy.Alice Isaaz is the stand-out in this. She offers a nuanced role and view about the situation, which let's face it, is as old as the hills (Lolita - type seductress and older man who 'can't resist'). Isaaz's character does remind her 45- year old father that HE is the adult. "Lolita's" doe-eyes and pouting were grating. Her's was a one-note performance. Cassell was workmanlike, but the character was beyond irritating. His inability to say "No" to a 17 year old temptress was incredibly annoying. The sight of the fading studs walking u the beach eyeing off pert young female flesh was annoying to say the least. I didn't find it funny on the whole, though there were a couple of moments. Was killing the neighbour's dog instead of a wild boar meant to be funny? It wasn't. I would not bother to seek this out at a cinema. Maybe a DVD on a rainy afternoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>French movies are either so boring and dull or totally opposite: really awesome. This one is really great and kinda feel good movie ( at least for me).What I liked about the movie... I liked the landscapes and whole background. Really nice nature of the Corsica ( though I believe it was filmed somewhere in the south of France) and colors of the summer. The soundtrack to the movie was surprisingly new - Lean On, Diamonds by Rihanna and many recent hits. The girls are really believable ( well, I guess all they had to do is to be themselves) and Vincent. The other dad was over dramatic and I had a feeling he was trying too hard to act those angry and awkward situations that he becomes cartoonishly silly. I did not know that the movie is a remake of the 70's movie... I might look for it. The whole summertime feel and carelessness feel remind me of another French movie: The Pool.All in all, the movie is really watchable and enjoyable. It ends with a girl smiling...and I couldn't help but smile too.Seven + from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you read a couple of things about this, then you know what direction this is going to. And the whole setup might annoy some people, because it does take its time to introduce the characters, make us aware of who is who and their general relationship with each other. I think it's important to know those things, others may disagree, just know where you are standing with this.Of course not all decisions by the characters are really good and appropriate. Otherwise we wouldn't have a movie and an issue in itself. The female in question has Lolita qualities and you can see where one would at least have thoughts that might not be in ones own best interest. Things are not always black and white, and people do certain things out of the spark of the moment (or because they were drunk). The ending ... well I'll let you decide what to make of it ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe how bad this movie is and how bad François Cluzet, George Bush look alike in it. A very annoying, phony, stupidly written and directed movie. I didn't even make it half way through before it almost put me to sleep. No character depth, I didn't connect or relate to the characters at all. Empty dialogs that lack true emotion. All actors were really bad, but François Cluzet was the worst. Unbelievable for a famous actor like him. I though he was not bad in The Untouchables. I generally enjoy French cinema, but they were following Hollywood steps lately producing junk after junk like this one or "Tu veux... ou tu veux pas?" for example.</fullReview>
