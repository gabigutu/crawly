		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it first came out. The theater was in a small town and there was nothing else to do that night so we went to the movie thinking it would be crap. Instead, I laughed so hard I almost fell out of my seat. I've loved the movie ever since.Everyone knows the premise---Michael Caine and Joseph Bologna take their teenage daughters, Michelle Johnson and Demi Moore to Rio for a vacation. Caine's marriage is in trouble and his wife is vacationing somewhere else. They're barely settled into the home they're renting when Johnson aggressively pursues Caine and he quickly succumbs (like any man would!). Caine is guilt-ridden but cannot resist Michelle's considerable charms. Her father finds out about the affair and goes nuts trying to find out who her lover is. He enlists Caine in his search and many hilarious scenes ensue.The setting for this movie is just gorgeous and the women are even more beautiful. This was Michelle Johnson's first movie and it shows but she does project a sweet sincerity and her va-va-voom body more than makes up for any performance shortcomings. Zowie! Catch the scene where the fathers find their daughters topless at the beach---this was well before Demi Moore had some "enhancements" later in her life and it is painfully obvious that she's extremely embarrassed by doing the topless scene. Michelle is a trouper though, lucky for us!The ultimate reason to see this movie though is Michael Caine. He is extremely funny in this movie and I can only imagine how much fun he had making it----a guy in his 40s getting to spend a few weeks in one of the most beautiful and exciting cities in the world and having all these love scenes with a girl half his age and getting paid to do it!!! Caine has made a lot of schlocky movies, for sure, but in an interview once he said that no matter how dumb the movie was or how cheaply it was done, he would try to give the best performance he could so even if the rest of the movie was crap, the viewer could at least appreciate that Caine did a good job. That dedication to his craft is what lifts what should've been a "C-" movie like "Rio" into a "B" "B-" movie instead and when he's in really good material, makes it unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fun light-hearted comedy, with magnificent views of Brazil and subtle comic performances. It captures that early eighties feel well. And broaches the subject of a teenage temptress more honestly than the recent version of Lolita.I can only think that this movie was out of time. probably from a gentler age, but it still hits the mark with me, even watching it now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the risk of ruining my credibility, I proudly declare this as one of my favorite movies. Nobody in their right mind would ever even contemplate a movie like this now, I know. In truth, I'm always shocked it was made at all. It's subject matter beyond the pale of even the low-life studio execs who make the big decisions. The most important and amazing consideration is it was intended as mainstream release. Its not a Troma shclock job. Its a very well made, extremely well written film about a very naughty topic. Consider it a blooper, an accident, if you will, but its great. Quick synopsis, a middle aged dude messes around and falls in love with his best friends 18 year old daughter. And its not exactly tastefully told. There's a ton of gratuitous nudity which is what really dooms it, and makes it just the sort of oddity and pariah people so love to hate. I'm old now, but when i fell in love with it I was like 19 so wipe the perverted sanctimonious smirk off of your face! I like good comedy and well made on location vacation pics, that inspire me to travel. So it's the Peters-Gelbart script and the wonderful scenery that have won it a place in my cold heart. Ok, ok, topless 18 year old girls are a decided bonus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now let me start by saying I love a good movie! I love a great script, engaging characters and brilliant cinematography.***This movie has none of these things!But it does have the type of storyline and pointless nudity that Hollywood seems unwilling to include in a mainstream film. This is one of those movies that was on HBO late at night when I was a kid and I loved it.There's something to great nudity! We just don't celebrate it enough anymore! Plus Demi Moore pre-implants!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of Caine's great comedies and should be watched immediately. Blame it on rio also stars Michelle Johnson, Joseph Bologna, Valerie Harper, Demi Moore. The film has many funny twists and turns to keep you laughing and guessing until the end. Nudity is all over this movie especially Michelle Johnson and a little bit of Demi Moore. Michael, Joseph, and Valerie are pros at this comedy and the two amateurs do a pretty good stab at making you laugh your head off. Blame it on Rio starts off a little slow but soon it is moving at fast speed and you better hang on to your seatcushions. A serious topic is discussed in both a serious and funny manner allowing you to see different sides of a story. This movie is like a favorite candy or soda that you cannot get enough of and that you want to have more of immediately. So kick back and relax and enjoy all the wild antics abound for you in this crazy comedy and at the end Blame it on Rio.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Role For Michael Caine?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was one major reason to watch this movie: Michelle Johnson, and that's about it. The film doesn't offer too much else. Basically, it's a silly story.Michael Caine ("Matthew") and Joseph Bologna ("Victor") plays some middle- aged guys who are going through marriage problems (bad marriage and a divorce, respectively) so they go down to Brazil to spend money since they're rich. They bring their late teen/young-adult daughters? Huh? Well, Victor's daughter is a knockout and they have a fling. Johnson plays the girl, "Jennifer," who shows off her breasts as much as she can in this film. This is why I and a lot of other guys saw this movie. In reality, there isn't much merit to this story, regardless. This must have been a wonderful role for Caine to play! Caine, an outstanding and likable actor, keeps this film - along with Johnson's obvious assets - from being a total bomb. As "Matthew," his mind knows this a bad relationship and vows to end it, but you know what else "doing the talking" for him, so it ain't easy. Demi Moore, by the way, plays Caine's daughter in this movie.It's really not a horrible film but it's pretty inane and crude in areas. The real shocker might not be all the nudity or sex jokes and lying but who directed the film: good 'ole Stanley Donen, who also gave us "Singin' In The Rain" and "Charade." How in the world did he get involved with this movie? Maybe Johnson was too much of an allure for him, too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a travelogue/sex-comedy with great photography of Rio, funny jokes and a pleasing early eighties feel. All the typical aspects of life in Brazil are shown like Carnival, native gods/religion, topless sunbathers, street dancers, the monolith dome with Jesus on top etc. There are a lot of funny lines that will keep you entertained and Michael Caine delivers them well. The soundtrack has a lot of bossa nova strains (composed by Ken Wannberg) and adds to the sexy, lighthearted mood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than you'd think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You read a plot synopsis for Blame It on Rio and immediately you think that this just has to be a terrible movie. And besides being terrible it's also going to be downright uncomfortable to watch as the story centers around some wildly inappropriate behavior. They'd never make a movie like this today you think and thank goodness for that. Yes, those would probably be your thoughts before you watch this movie. But then you watch it and it's actually not that bad. Yes there is that uneasy feeling throughout due to the fact that the subject matter is more than a little icky. But the movie is entertaining. It's light-hearted fun. In fact you could even call it charming if not for the fact that there's nothing particularly charming about a middle-aged man having sex with his best friend's teenage daughter.So our story is about this exceedingly inappropriate relationship. And the movie plays it for laughs. And it works? Ah, the 1980s. A very different world from today that's for sure. Blame It on Rio is never uproariously funny but there are enough good comic moments sprinkled throughout to keep things moving along nicely. In playing Matthew, the man who can't resist the charms of the teenage temptress, it is Michael Caine who really holds the movie together. An awkward character to play no doubt and Caine makes it work. From the moment we meet him, even before his wild fling, Matthew never seems entirely comfortable in his own skin. Preying on that awkwardness is his own personal Lolita. She goes by the name of Jennifer and is played by Michelle Johnson for whom comfort in her own skin was apparently not an issue. Yowzers! Easy to see how it would be difficult for any man to resist her feminine charms. But Matthew, you're forty-something, she's a teenager, and she's your best friend's daughter! This can't happen! But it does and...hilarity ensues? Yeah you wouldn't think this is a particularly comedic situation but that's the direction in which this movie goes and somehow it kind of works.It's hard to fully embrace the movie as none of the main characters come off particularly well. The Matthew-Jennifer relationship is not the only inappropriate thing going on here, not by a long shot. You'd think Jennifer's father, what with his best friend sleeping with his nubile daughter, would be the sympathetic character. But, as portrayed by Joseph Bologna, he's a sleaze too. Who in this movie isn't? Well, there's Matthew's daughter Nicole. Demi Moore plays the role and it's a smaller part compared to Caine, Johnson and Bologna. But if you sympathize with anyone it's her. She has an innocence about her. All the adults in this movie have lost their innocence long ago. And her friend Jennifer can't wait to lose hers...with Nicole's father no less. Poor Nicole. She even has to suffer in comparison standing next to the voluptuous Jennifer on one of Rio's famous topless beaches. At this point in her life Demi Moore had not yet embraced the wonders of surgical enhancement and that leaves Nicole bashful, trying to cover up her modest assets with her long hair. Jennifer? She's not bashful. But somehow she's still sweet and charming. And there's still a vulnerability and touch of innocence to her even as she's taking off her clothes and seducing a middle-aged man. It's hard to figure. The story shouldn't work, the movie shouldn't work, we really shouldn't be finding any of this funny. But somehow the end result isn't that bad at all. Go into this movie with low expectations and you may well be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Make Room For Daddy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A comedy where a middle-aged man has sex with his best friend's teenage daughter would seem morally wrong on so many levels as to violate municipal zoning ordinances. So why my lack of shame in copping to really enjoying this movie? Watching "Blame It On Rio" back in 1984 when I was 18, the following items appealed to me. 1. Michelle Johnson naked. 2. Michelle Johnson in white pants. 3. Michael Caine's monologues. 4. Caine's chemistry with Joseph Bologna. 5. Michelle in her two-toned bikini.Watching it now doesn't change what I like so much as in what order. Michelle Johnson is an extraordinarily beautiful woman and an engaging presence when she doesn't have a crying scene, and I think I have grown to appreciate her in other stages of dress, but the person that makes this film work for me now is Caine, whose level of commitment to this film is a thing of wonder."Blame It On Rio" is a sex farce which skates around real human feelings with moments of slapstick and sitcom repartee. There are about 150 ways the film can go wrong, but Caine sells it by keeping it light and silly.Caine's character, Matthew Hollis, is a sympathetic, awkward type whose life gets upended when his wife Karen (Valerie Harper) decides she isn't going with him on vacation to Rio de Janiero. So it's just him, his friend Victor (Bologna), Victor's daughter Jennifer (Johnson), and Matthew's daughter Nicole (Demi Moore.) Victor rides Matthew about making the most of his new opportunity: "Is tasting life, creating a little magic, is that cheating? You're a long time dead."Jennifer has her own ideas on what Matthew should be doing, which she unleashes on him at an evening wedding festival at a beach: "Poor Uncle Matthew, he never had a chance." Her nude scenes still pack a punch, but its the stuff in-between the nude scenes that excite me more now. Caine with anything in his hands, whether it be grating a carrot or brushing his teeth, is joyfully amusing, and his one-liners as revealed "Alfie"-style to the camera are just a lot of fun: "He needed my help...it's like asking an arsonist become the fire chief." Bologna also makes me laugh, but something else, too. In his own askew, over-emoting way, he's the heart that makes the film work. When he discovers his daughter has been seeing another man, he immediately settles on Matthew - for help finding the culprit. This accounts for the funniest scenes in the film, but it also gives us something to care about. You laugh at Victor's blindness, but you also feel a little between the giggles when he tells Matthew: "You're a rock."The main problem I have with "Blame It On Rio" is it is not all that sharp in the one-liner department. Co-screenwriter Larry Gelbart was the guy behind "Tootsie" and the best years of the sitcom "M*A*S*H," but he and Charlie Peters don't produce an especially witty script. There are funny lines, but more duds than you'd expect. "I've always had a problem with nudity. Sometimes, when I'm getting undressed, I almost wish I could leave the room, know what I mean?" Matthew asks us at one point. Fortunately, the writing gets much better in the second half, especially in the last twenty minutes when Matthew discovers he's not the only guy keeping a secret.Celebrated director Stanley Donen makes the most of the natural beauty and native music of his location while keeping everything as light and fizzy as a tropical drink. "Blame It On Rio" may be morally dubious, but it's solid Hollywood fun of the kind Donen delivered for decades and as good a film as any for him to go out on. And thanks to Caine, "Blame It On Rio" still holds up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blame It On Rio is a comedy of manners, of embarrassment, and a mildly raunchy adult amusement. At least that's what the publicity says it is - I'm not so sure.Michael Caine and Joseph Bologna are business partners who take their daughters - Demi Moore and Michelle Johnson - on holiday to Rio de Janeiro for reasons which don't really matter. While they are there, the precocious Johnson pursues and ultimately seduces Caine, and shenanigans ensue (the main one of which is Caine having to help Bologna pursue the un-named older man - ie. himself - who is having an inappropriate relationship with Bologna's daughter).This is bright, breezy, comical stuff, with lots of nice scenery. Caine's performance (with lots of direct-to-camera speeches) is pleasingly desperate, and Johnson's body is pleasingly and frequently naked (and, it must be said, startlingly ripe).I'm not 100% convinced about the subject matter, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-sexed 80's film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Blame it on Rio" is a romantic comedy 80's style, with more than an eye full of sex throughout its 101 minute running time.The plot concerns two middle-aged men in crisis, one of whom is sorting through his divorce, the other dealing with the possibility of that same prospect. Both good friends, they decide to take a vacation in exotic Rio de Janeiro, each with a daughter at their side. Complications set in when one of them gets involved with the other's daughter.This potential riot of a story is fairly funny and there are some good lines, however it never really becomes hilarious, as it could have. Any attempt at handling the moral issue seriously doesn't work either, and perhaps director Donen should have stuck to the humour of the situation.Not a bad film, but what really ruins it is Michelle Johnson's awful performance as the naughty little temptress Jennifer. While she uses her body to full advantage, it's the only thing she's got. Michelle's acting prowess leaves a great deal to be desired. No wonder we haven't seen her in anything else.Friday, January 7, 1994 - Video</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michelle Johnson -- we hardly got to know you!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should rate this higher than I did. The mainstream critics have bashed it like it was written and directed by the devil himself. The main idea of an 18 year old daughter seducing her Dad's best friend (practically in front of HIS daughter) while on a family vacation, is clearly creepy. But it is written as pure comedy and played for laughs. That takes some of the sting out of it. And........the scenery, and I mean all the scenery, is fabulous. Caine and Bologna (an acquired taste) stumble and stammer thru some funny dialog, and no one was injured during the filming of this movie. Well, possibly the insanely gorgeous Michelle Johnson's career. She was in her 1st film and asked to display her assets early and often. And she looks GREAT!! As pretty an 18 year old as you will ever see on film. But she had no acting skills and came off as such an amateur that I would "Blame I On" the director. It may have been hard to do retakes to get it right, or he would have killed Michael Caine in the process.If you don't mind tasteful nudity of a tasteless situation, a typically grating cameo by Valerie Harper and the most colorful and lush view of Rio ever, take a watch. On edited TV its a 3, on cable it's a 6 or 7!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All in all, don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.And if you want to see a movie that will take you back to 1983, this will do that for sure. The only reason I gave this movie 2 points more than it deserves is for 2 reasons:#1. Michael Caine#2. the people, the sights, the culture and the music of Brazil The movie is almost completely carried by Caine as he commits the seemingly impossible task of transforming it into a viable and semi-believable story. Even Joe Bologna and Valerie Harper fall short. Michael Caine is pure class, as always. Besides being a gifted classical and comic actor, Caine brings a blend of introspection, mischievousness and sensitivity to every movie he does ... the focus of his charm as far back as his role in Alfie...and the reason why he won the Academy Award for Hannah and her Sisters 2 years later. In this farce, he is tenderly beguiling...funny and vulnerable... melancholy and sentimental....and besides the jewel that is Rio de Janeiro, the ONLY reason to not seek out a better form of entertainment.Well...maybe a glimpse at the 2 lovely young actresses, Michelle Johnson and Demi Moore would be a reason. But look is all you can do at Michelle (though her look seems sorely dated)....there couldn't be a more painful movie experience than watching her "try" to act (most of her dialogue seems overdubbed, too). Demi's acting and looks hold up 100 times better and you could easily transplant her, as is, into any movie today (she doesn't really look much different to be honest). Ms. Moore is surely underused, especially considering she was the bigger star of the 2. Save the fact that it is a silly farce, at the end, I actually kind of like the maturity with which all these people handle this scandalous situation...that it doesn't end friendships nor marriages and that an affair, even with the underage daughter of your best friend, could be forgiven and everyone can move on. The injured parties do show anger and disappointment at what transpired, but all works out for the best....a bit unrealistic for sure, but surprisingly refreshing. Hope always is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This light-hearted comedy features Michael Caine (Matthew) and Joseph Bologna (Victor) as two middle-aged best friends who go on a summer vacation to Brazil, each with a daughter in tow. Beautiful, voluptuous Michelle Johnson (Jennifer) and a pretty Demi Moore play the teen daughters. Jennifer falls for Matthew and they begin a wild and passionate, but secret affair. When Matthew decides to finally break it off with her, she cries to her father about the man she loves who broke her heart, so Victor goes on a search for the mystery man who hurt his daughter. Comic madness ensues. Filmed in the lush, tropical beaches, mountains and forests of Rio de Janeiro, this is one great vacation movie. Also starring a very funny Valerie Harper as Matthew's wife, who has some secrets of her own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blame it on anyone who had anything to do with this lousy movie. But don't blame it on Rio.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why blame it on Rio? Blame it on the scriptwriters, who should have realised that a storyline about a teenage girl who goes on holiday to Rio de Janeiro and ends up having an affair with her father's best friend, a married man more then twice her age, would need to be handled sensitively if it were not to end up as little more than barely legal kiddie porn. Sensitivity, however, is a commodity in short supply in this silly sex comedy, which is just as trashy and exploitative as it sounds. Although it is ostensibly a comedy, wit and humour are nowhere in evidence either.Blame it on Stanley Donen. Donen was perhaps a director who hit his peak too soon, directing his greatest film "Singin' in the Rain" while still in his twenties. Although he made some other good musicals and comedies in the fifties and early sixties, he was left looking like a figure from the past by the decline of the Hollywood musical and the cinematic revolution of the late sixties and seventies. There were other directors around this time who were also left looking like dinosaurs, but most of them were a generation older than Donen who was only in his early forties when that revolution began. Although he is still alive more than a quarter of a century later, "Blame It on Rio" was to be his last film as both director and producer, and I doubt if it is the one he wants to be remembered by. (His penultimate offering, "Saturn Three", was pretty awful too).Blame it on Michael Caine. He has always had the ability, infuriating to those like me who admire for his best work, to move effortlessly from the sublime to the ridiculous and back again. Every film star, however eminent or talented, has at the back of their wardrobe what I think of as a "silver chalice" (after Paul Newman's disastrous screen debut, which he later publicly disowned). Sir Michael has a whole shelf full of silver chalices on public display. Which explains why he is the star not only of fine movies like "Alfie", "Get Carter" and "Hannah and her Sisters" but also of "The Swarm" and "Blame It on Rio". Here he plays Matthew, the middle-aged businessman who ends up being seduced by the amorous and hormonally overactive Jennifer. The only explanation for this bizarre choice of role is that, after all the hard work he had put in on "Educating Rita" and "The Honorary Consul" (two more of his best films), he felt that he was in need of some rest and relaxation, and could think of nothing more restful and relaxing than spending time with a beautiful near-naked teenage starlet in the tropical sunshine. Donen borrows the device used by Lewis Gilbert in "Alfie" of having Caine speak direct to camera, but that is about all the two films have in common. In terms of quality they are miles apart.Blame it on Joseph Bologna, who plays Jennifer's father Victor. Certainly, any character who takes as obsessive an interest in his daughter's love life as Victor does in Jennifer's is bound to seem somewhat creepy, but Bologna makes Victor creepier than he need be. His fury on discovering that Jennifer has an older lover seems less like parental over-protectiveness than like jealousy.Blame it on the lovely Michelle Johnson as Jennifer. Blessed with the angelic looks of a Brooke Shields (albeit with a more voluptuous figure than Brooke's slim, boyish one), Michelle was, before the film came out, hotly tipped for stardom. After it came out, she wasn't. Although she was happy to display her charms to the world, modesty obviously compelled her to keep her acting talents well hidden. The film also introduced another lovely young actress, Demi Moore who plays Nikki, Matthew's daughter and Jennifer's best friend. Demi, however, survived the wreck of this film much better than Michelle, probably because hers was only a minor role, and did indeed go on to become a major star.Blame it on the director, the producer, the scriptwriters, the actors. Blame it on whoever wrote that irritating theme song. Blame it on anyone who had anything to do with this lousy movie. But don't blame it on Rio. Why should the blameless citizens of that fair city be held responsible for the crimes against art and good taste which are committed in their name? 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Much Outside the Nudity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blame It on Rio (1984) * 1/2 (out of 4) Matthew Hollis (Michael Caine) and his best friend Victor (Joseph Bologna) take their 17-year-old daughters on vacation to Rio where all sorts of trouble happens. Matthew, going thru a dried up marriage, falls to the seduction of his friend's daughter (Michelle Johnson) and soon the affair is going to have all sorts of people in trouble. Had this movie been made in the 1970's then it would have been a serious look at a troubled situation. Since it was made in the 80's it has been turned into a rather idiotic sex comedy and one that is pretty awful with the exception of a few things that keep it moving. The non-stop nudity is pretty shocking even by the 80's standards but the only thing more shocking is the fact that Stanley Donen directed this thing. Yes folks, the man behind SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, CHARADE, ON THE TOWN and FUNNY FACE also made this thing and it's clear this type of comedy just wasn't his thing. The entire picture is just so uneven that it's hard to really follow any of it and the attempts at humor just aren't funny and instead come across as rather creepy. I'm going to overlook the subject matter of a man sleeping with his friend's teenage daughter but there's a scene on the beach where the girls are topless and they come up to their fathers in a way, which was just kinda sick to watch. The film has gained a rather notorious reputation over the years due to all of the nudity and especially that by Johnson. I'm not going to lie, she looks amazing and her nude scenes certainly help keep the picture going but at the same time her performance is pretty bad, but this here is to be somewhat expected. She was just 17-years-old when this movie was made so think about that. Caine turns in a pretty bad performance as the father and it appears that he's rather uncomfortable throughout the entire film. Yes, the character is supposed to be uncomfortable with the situation but I really do wonder if Caine was nervous or didn't like the idea that he was actually messing around with an actress who wasn't yet at a legal age. Bologna is good in his supporting role as is Valerie Harper and there's also a young Demi Moore. BLAME IT ON RIO is a really stupid movie that adds up to a big fat zero in regards to its story. It's not funny. It's creepy at times and it just doesn't work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing and surprisingly innocuous sex farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hapless middle-aged nerd Matthew Hollis (an excellent and engaging performance by Michael Caine) and his amiable sleaze best friend Victor Lyons (robustly played by Joseph Bologna) go on vacation to Rio with their teenage daughters in tow. Trouble rears its head when Matthew gets seduced by Victor's sultry nubile daughter Jennifer (a disarmingly sweet portrayal by the luscious Michelle Johnson). Director Stanley Donen relates the delightfully risqué story at a brisk pace, makes the most out of the exotic location, and gives the movie an easy'n'breezy charm that prevents the potentially distasteful subject matter from ever becoming too crass or offensive. Moreover, this film serves as a pleasant time capsule of the carefree 1980's, a pre-politically correct era when people where a lot less uptight and not so touchy feely. The racy script by Larry Gilbert and Charlie Peters offers a sidesplitting wealth of sharp lines. Caine and Bologna display a strong and appealing chemistry in the leads; they receive sound support from Demi Moore as Matthew's bitter daughter Nicole, Valerie Harper as Matthew's snippy fed-up wife Karen, and Jose Lewjoy as suave neighbor Eduardo Marques. The vibrant cinematography by Reynaldo Villalobos provides plenty of striking shots of the sumptuous seaside scenery. The lively score by Kenneth Wannberg and the bouncy soundtrack further add to the infectiously frothy merriment. As a tasty extra plus, the delectable Mrs. Johnson bares her deliciously ripe body several times. A real hoot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am Brazilian and there aren't many foreign movies shot in Brazil that I like. This one is really an exception. It's well made and very, very funny! Apart from some obligatory clichés (which I actually found made the film even funnier), like the many macaws everywhere on everybody's shoulder, people on the beach embraced with apes and women there running in topless, all actors are very good and there is a joke on almost every line.It's a movie for a good and relaxed time that really makes you stand up right away, drive straight to the airport and catch the first flight to... Rio de Janeiro!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the truly great adult comedies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To heck with self-important critics and carping prudes, this is one of the best adult comedies ever made, and I think the best and fairest review here is by John Edward O'Brien. All the actors seemed well picked for their parts, especially radiant Michelle Johnson.The only reasons I can think of for the hostility toward the film are the prejudice against older men together with younger women and Michelle Johnson's striking and uninhibited beauty, which must make every woman or girl who sees it green with envy. Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn certainly acted like that when they saw her in the scene in Death Becomes Her.And it is very cute the way Demi Moore tried to hide herself under her long tresses in the topless beach scene.I have been disappointed not to see more of Michelle Johnson in movies, and I hope she is happy. This film certainly lifted my spirits.It certainly should be out on DVD, unedited.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant double act Bologna and Caine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Caine simply never gets asked about his involvement in this film and that is a shame. In his career he has had limited success in comedies but this is the exception. Caine and Bologna make a terrific double act and I laughed myself stupid from start to finish.Admittedly the concept is rather weak but it is carried off brilliantly. Bologna steals the film for me with his protective father routine and is a joy to watch. The inclusion of just a few other cast members is very clever with each one delivering killer lines as the plot unfolds. The best scene in the film is when Caine employs a woman to use her skills in the occult to make his desires go away. One of the very best comedies I have seen . One tip if you like the film buy it on DVD as it is very rarely shown on television.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blame It On The Writers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh boy. Where do we begin...? "Blame It On Rio" is a story about two middle-aged men with marital troubles who take a vacation in Brazil with their daughters. Romantic entanglements ensue. It sounds like a fun premise, doesn't it? I thought so, too. But this movie was such a mess I wondered how it was made.Michael Caine- a very honest man- once confessed that in his later years he has chosen his films based solely on WHERE they will be shot. He admitted the warm climate and tropical location was why he said yes to "JAWS: The Revenge," and I can only imagine he had similar motives for "Rio". He spends most of the film wearing enormous glasses and looking befuddled.You see, in a moment of weakness he sleeps with his best friend's daughter, who falls instantly- and inexplicably- in love with him. Michelle Johnson as Jennifer is pretty and sweet, and finds nine new reasons to take her top off between gushing, "You love me! You really love me!"Joseph Bologna's performance should earn him a life sentence in the Bad Actor's Prison (if only there were) as he overacts every scene and over-shouts every weak, sitcom-strength one-liner. The lame comedy was probably the work of writer Larry Gelbart, who here was WAY past his prime. And speaking of past primes, director Stanley Donen- at the end of a long and successful career- created a movie so bad he never directed another film.Demi Moore is instantly forgettable in the thankless role of the third wheel. This movie was so bad even Valerie Harper came off as awful. Yes, this was supposed to be a French farce-style sexcapade with naughty fun and ever-so-twee misunderstandings, but what we get is a sloppy sitcom of a film with paper characters, dismal dialogue and a very silly story. Watch three episodes of "Three's Company" instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Look, we know why people watch this flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one saw it in the hopes of seeing a great performance out of Michael Caine -- who is, IMHO, one of the most seriously overrated actors of the last generation -- or due to the cinematography and setting. They were hoping to see hot young actresses naked (and, probably as much to the point, hot young actresses eager to sleep with middle-aged men). That much the film delivered ... at least where 17-year-old Johnson was concerned, Moore having an uncharacteristic fit of shyness. Anyone expecting anything different from Blame It On Rio ought to have their heads examined. What the heck else did you think it was going to be about? As it happens, I recall Roger Ebert's comment at the time that Michelle Johnson was on track to become the next Bo Derek -- which in retrospect did Johnson no favor by the comparison -- and possibly she should have been, but the Just Say No era turned into a bad time for overt hedonism. Johnson has had tolerably steady work since, but most of it's been TV movie bit parts and direct to video.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extra credit review for Blame it on Rio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blame it on Rio was a different movie, to say the least. I think the movie industry was going crazy being the Hayes code was recently lifted so they were having fun with anything that would have violated it. The movie did not have much of a story at all, a basic she loves him he doesn't love her back idea, but there was no depth. It seemed to focus on sex and nudity. Although there was an overuse of showing topless women the art in the movie was beautiful. There were so many bright colors with intense detail; everything from the beach scenes to the kitchen in the house were so illustrated. I am not exactly sure where the film was shot, but wherever it was could definitely pass for Rio. I actually found the movie itself annoying though because Michelle was portrayed as an over emotional and na?ve (some may call a typical teenage girl) and I did not like this. It is very unrealistic for an 18 year old to run around topless in front of her father and then have sex with his best friend who is also her best friend's father and a man she refers to as her uncle. Meanwhile Victor, Michelle's father had been sleeping with his best friend's wife, this is also very unrealistic. Even though the story line was a disappointment the actors did play their role very well and did not break character. I would not say this movie was particularly good, but the situation the characters were put in was somewhat interesting which is why I was able to make it through the entire movie. I would in no means recommend this unless it met some type of criteria for an assignment or research etc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's funny how much time changes your perspective on life. I first saw this movie when I was 12 or 13. The VCR had just come out and my family rented one as part of a New Years treat. I think my dad may have intended this one to be just for the adults (or just for him :) ) but of course I stayed up late and watched it. I was absolutely convinced that I was in love with Michelle Johnson. I had never seen a more beautiful angel in my life, and I honestly couldn't blame Caine's character for his actions. Heck, I even hoped the romance would work out.In case you are unfamiliar with the plot, the basic idea is that Matthew Hollins (Caine) is going thru a mid-life crises. His best friend suggests they rent a nice house in Rio and head down for vacation with their teenage daughters. Once there, Matthew begins an affair with his best friends daughter and, I guess, hilarity ensues.Anyway, flash forward a few years and I decided to rent the movie for nostalgia's sake. Big mistake. It's like re-reading your favorite novel from when you were a kid; as an adult you see all the shortcomings you missed as a child. Apart from Caine the acting is mostly dreadful, especially the very photogenic Johnson. The plot is ridiculous, and, as I discovered 45 minutes or so into the movie, really really creepy. There is a scene where Caine and Johnson are lying in a hammock and he recalls kissing her bottom at her Christening. Directly after this little stroll down memory lane, they have sex. OMG! Is it possible to get any more twisted? I had to stop the movie at this point.Anywho, apart from just how wrong the central plot is, I will say a couple of nice things about the movie. First, Rio has never looked more beautiful. Made me want to plan my next vacation there. Second, you can see a young Demi Moore in one of her first roles. And third, although the movie itself doesn't match up to my childhood memories, Michelle Johnson does look gorgeous in this. So, all in all, I give it a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

However now I am a man of 34, and while I still look at the girls (who have aged in this movie much better then I have by the way) I look at it from an older point of view, and appreciate it for its depth, and the sweet romantic struggles within the film.

		<shortDescription>Not recommended if you are too young to remember the 1980s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the internet, before late-night cable TV shows, before the VCR brought entertainment of all types into the privacy of American homes, there were movies like "10", "The Blue Lagoon", and "Blame it on Rio", whose chief attraction was the opportunity to glimpse beautiful women parade around in nothing or next to it. Nowadays, of course, much more explicit material can be found with the click of a mouse. But given that I had seen the first two of those three movies when they were initially released, but not the third, I decided to use the wonders of the internet to go back in time to see how "Blame it on Rio" would come across in the year 2011.The short answer: "Blame it on Rio" is slightly deeper (and longer) than an episode of "The Love Boat"; it's about on par, as far as psychologically based comedies go, with the Chicago-based version of "The Bob Newhart Show". So there are no insightful commentaries on the human condition contained within the storyline: the basic message, I would say, is that it is awfully hard to remain monogamous for the entire lifetime of a marriage. The storyline never quite degenerates into a farce, which would probably be an improvement, nor is it dramatic; it is sort of in between. Thus, the chief attraction, twenty-seven years later, remains the eye candy.There won't be enough eye candy to satisfy 21st century viewers seeking visual thrills; as I said there is much more explicit content on the internet which is more easily accessible. But for those who were of age in the 1980s, watching "Blame it in Rio" does offer some highlights, while bringing back memories of how entertainment used to be. The main highlights are Michelle Johnson, who gives what turns out to be the best performance of her career while at the peak of physical perfection of her young nubile self; and the gorgeous portrayal of the city of Rio de Janeiro in a more carefree, innocent time, before it became known more for crime and slums.The lines that Michelle Johnson has to utter are usually cringe-inducing, or that is they would be if the viewer was paying any attention at all to them, but fortunately she provides ample visual distraction, and for that her performance is to be applauded. She does a great job shedding her inhibitions. But surprisingly, in retrospect, the young female actress who went on to much more fame and fortune, and who is even now still on the cover of celebrity magazines, is Demi Moore. In "Blame it on Rio", Demi can't hold a candle next to Michelle Johnson's performance."Blame it on Rio" is recommended only for folks such as myself, who remember the impact it made at the time but didn't see it then. It is not a classic, or even as good a movie as Blake Edwards' "10".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blame it on Rio or how Stanley Donen and Michael Caine make irresponsible behavior legitimate !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All film fans must question the usage of names of famous cities as titles of films which have been controversial due to their explicit sexual content.Film fans can cite examples of films like "Last tango in Paris" and "Blame it on Rio".One can wonder what have reputed cities got to do with films wherein characters have indulged in highly irresponsible behavior.Veteran American director Stanley Donen's film "Blame it on Rio" is one of those rare films which legitimizes irresponsible behavior.It is a mystery that it has been classified as a romantic comedy.This must come as a shock to those fans who consider it as a drama film exploring somewhat taboo themes involving bizarre characters who make it a point to outshine each other over matters related to unfaithfulness and sexual misconduct.Apart from Brazilian city Rio De Janeiro,British actor Michael Caine in two different yet fascinating avatars is this film's major attraction.He is good as a narrator but somewhat dorky as an actor.This is fine for critics but would not deter interested daddies to enjoy this film with their nubile daughters.May be they would learn a thing or two from "Blame it on Rio".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blame It on Rio is a slightly, enjoyably sexy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having originally recorded this movie, Blame It on Rio, a little more than 20 years ago on HBO, I finally got around to seeing it a few hours ago. I have to admit that the reason was to see some nudity of young women like those of Demi Moore and Michelle Johnson. Johnson certainly filled up nicely considering she was about 17 at the time while Moore seemed a little awkward with her hair covering her breasts up. Loved the way Ms. Johnson keeps teasing Michael Caine at the dinner table after they made love on the beach! Also loved Caine's covering his naked self with sand when a couple who are acquaintances with him meet him there. Ms. Johnson does reveal her amateurish acting skills when she attempts to confess her affair with a middle-age man (without IDing him) to Caine's best friend and her father, Joseph Bologna, but maybe she's supposed to sound like that. Anyway, this was a leisurely sex-romantic-travelogue comedy with some witty lines and visual touches provided by co-writer Larry Gelbart and director Stanley Donen. Also making the most of her part is Valerie Harper as Caine's wife who's considering a divorce. All in all, not hilarious except in parts but pretty enjoyable especially when focused on Caine and Ms. Johnson. I'm getting aroused just thinking about them...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was Donen's excuse for this mess?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, this was bad. Unbelievably so, given the writing credits, given Bologna and Caine, and given the fact that this was helmed by one of my favorite directors: two of his films are in my Top Ten to take to a desert island. I couldn't figure out even that this was supposed to be a comedy until I was maybe halfway into it. No comedy, black or otherwise, is supposed to keep the viewer guessing for half the film whether this is the genre That's a big clue that it just doesn't work.I see that Michelle Johnson was nominated for a Razzie, and she certainly deserved it, although Donen's the one really at fault here. He certainly seems to have lost his mind with this casting, the actress's most noticeable assets being located between her neck and her navel, and her greatest talent apparently her willingness to show them. Again, the atrocious performance by the female lead is Donen's fault (and is it any wonder that this was his last cinema release?), since Ms. Johnson was a mere 17, fresh out of high school and signed up to be a model. Her status as a minor just adds to the overall creepy quality of this film.I've nothing against age-gap romance on film or in real life, but I do have something against minors used in this way for a film, and I also have something against the "comic" plot of the hook-up of a man with his good friend's daughter, whom he has known since birth and is his daughter's friend. Yes, this situation has been seen, more or less, in cinema both before and since, but not in this chuckle-chuckle buddy-film sort of way, and the others I've seen have higher values of every sort. Caine's character takes advantage, utterly ignores his own daughter (Demi Moore is wasted here), lies to his friend, and commits adultery, and we're supposed to find it all very nutty and funny.The plot twist near the end did take me by surprise---contrived though it was---but even then I don't think I smiled once. What an icky, icky film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film couldn't have been made at any other period of time than that tumultuous, garishly colored, love affair with dubious, cheesy excess known as the 1980's. At any other period of time, this movie would simply be overlooked as a horrid piece of meaningless crap. But not in the 80's, oh no. As a fine work of pure cheese, in the decade of cheese, this film is a sort of masterwork. Everything about this film is total cheese: the acting, the writing, the directing, and cheesiest of all, the music. Has a movie ever had a more grating theme than this movie? It even trumps "I Had The Time Of My Life" and "She's Like The Wind" from Dirty Dancing, which is no small accomplishment. And not only that, but the song is repeated several times throughout the movie. And oh, what else is there? Michael Caine's horrible hair, enormous glasses, and that whacky blue underwear he wears. And Joseph Bologna's insane overacting! Demi Moore's insane attempts at acting! And Michelle Johnson's ample nudity, ample bosom, and insane attempts at being seductive! One could charitably call this film an awkward misfire, but if you're up for it, it's a fine helping of cheese, and a good reminder that as bad as movies can be now, the 80's were the true decade of crap! Crap would never again be as hilariously crappy as it was in the 1980's, and Blame It On Rio is the king of 80's crap!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fell in love with Rio, the first time I saw this movie, but I fell in love with this movie too. People have said the film is about incest. It isn't. Sometimes best friends are called Uncles, as is the case here. Here, drawing an sexual attraction enigma, like Alvin Purple, young nineteen year old beauty, Jennifer (Johnson, no acting chops wasted although she did get better) falls for forty three year old Matthew (Caine, of course, great as usual and funny) while vacationing in Rio with her father (Bologna) and Caine's perceptive and level headed daughter (Moore). Things get hot, and the nights hotter, where Caine soon is forced to draw the line, before his mate finds out. The script written by Mash writer, Gelbart, has stylish, and thought provoking and memorable dialogue, throughout, I could spout off, after seeing it. It's great, and the situations that unfold in the story are fun, if realistic, as if in the real scenario. BIOR has some cheeky scenes, the beach strewn with boobs of Brazilian babes, one uncomfortable scene, has the daughters, bouncing boobs flapping about in their nakedness, where they approach their fathers, who of course, are uncomfortable. Who wouldn't be? I first saw this movie when I was 14, and have always found it deliciously entertaining, as in the funny moments, as well as a few scenes which has Caine, speaking to camera, with great comic timing in his delivery of dialogue, not just here. The music is good in this too, with a mum angry maid who works at the lodge, where Caine and co are staying. An old codger neighbor is quite a hoot too. I guess one flaw with it, is the screen time of Moore, if kind of neglected as to the three leads. She comes and goes. But hey, we have the appetizing Johnson, one saucy full on nude shot to camera, memorable. Really her and Caine make the film, where Valerie Harper, co starring as Caine's wife, out acts them all in a very good performance for one scarce small number of scenes she's in. The scene with her confronting Johnson, leaves you kind of sore with disillusion, as to her behavior, a lesson to be learn' t here. Harper's character, Karen, even tells her she's envious of her. Original Fun movie and non incestuous tale (get it right) throughout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Blame It On Rio" is like taking a great vacation of fun, sun and no inhibitions. The setting is beautiful Rio de Janeiro and the film gives an honest impression of the city... beautiful beaches, Bossa Nova flavored music, tropical climate.Michael Caine is hilarious, Joseph Bologna a perfect comical foil to Caine, Michelle Johnson sweet and innocent, and Demi Moore likable and levelheaded. Michael Caine and Joseph Bologna are a great battling comedy due. Michelle Johnson's acting was perfect for the part, so comments to the contrary are simply unfounded. Try to imagine the part being acted in any other fashion and nothing else fits. I think some reviewers believed she was just acting herself so didn't "see" the acting. But that simply reveals that she's a great actor.Great aerial views of Rio de Janeiro, lively background music and many Brazilian cultural scenes and nuances make this a highly enjoyable movie. If you want fantastic scenery, some of the funniest lines in a comedy and a lot of laughs, this is the film for you.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a gem, 30 years on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason, it amazes me this film still holds up after three decades. I really shouldn't be surprised, though. The script is clever and engaging, and the acting is fine, if a bit campy, and actually provides one of Michael Caine's more memorable comic performances.Maybe it's the taboo subject of a middle-aged man coupling with a woman young enough to be his daughter. I used to have my own copy, but was probably too embarrassed to be caught with it in my library (daddy porn?! really?!) and got rid of it. But now, in the 21st century, when omnisexuality is all the rage (people of the same gender?, sheep?, chickens?), a woman trysting with a man seems tame, and even downright old fashioned. (For you youngsters: it used to be considered healthy and normal for women and men to discreetly engage in coitus; it wasn't until about the 1980s that the people who couldn't figure out how to do it, or otherwise weren't getting any, managed to have the act categorized as a public health hazard.)Anyway, I just caught the film again, on This TV, of all places. The female nudity was censored, of course, lest we be corrupted by the sight of naked mammaries. (Timeworn Motion Picture Production Code values: chainsaw beheadings good; bare breasts bad.) But Michelle Johnson's beatific face, 80s bouffant, and sexy eyebrows were plenty suggestive. I just may head down to our local video store and see if I can't find a copy to put back into my library. It would make a great double feature with Robin Wright and Naomi Watts's "Adore".</fullReview>

They intend to go on a family vacation together but Matthew's wife Karen (Valerie Harper) surprises everyone by going to Bahia Club Med instead. She needs time to think about their struggling marriage. Victor is also going through a difficult divorce. The two dads bring along their teenage daughters Jennifer Lyons (Michelle Johnson) and Nikki Hollis (Demi Moore). Matthew is uncomfortable with the liberated sexuality. Jennifer starts flirting with Matthew and they have an affair. He tries to break up and she tells her father about her older married boyfriend. Victor ropes Matthew in to find the identity of this older man.This is suppose to be a comedy but I find the subject matter saps much of the humor away. It's not just that she's that young but she's also a girl he's known since she was a baby. Also Michelle Johnson is quite young to do full nudity. Wiki claims that she got court permission to appear nude at the age of 17. It's a teenage boy's dream but it should be uncomfortable for everybody else. It's not a surprise that this is based on a French film. Michael Caine does salvage a few fun moments with his acting. It's a watchable comedy if one doesn't get offended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Legitimization of illegal behaviour in the name of entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All film fans must question the usage of names of famous cities as titles of films which have been controversial due to their explicit sexual content.Film fans can cite examples of films like "Last tango in Paris" and "Blame it on Rio".One can wonder what have reputed cities got to do with films wherein characters have indulged in highly irresponsible behavior.Veteran American director Stanley Donen's film "Blame it on Rio" is one of those rare films which legitimizes irresponsible behavior.It is a mystery that it has been classified as a romantic comedy.This must come as a shock to those fans who consider it as a drama film exploring somewhat taboo themes involving bizarre characters who make it a point to outshine each other over matters related to unfaithfulness and sexual misconduct.Apart from Brazilian city Rio De Janeiro,British actor Michael Caine in two different yet fascinating avatars is this film's major attraction.He is good as a narrator but somewhat dorky as an actor.This is fine for critics but would not deter interested daddies to enjoy this film with their nubile daughters.May be they would learn a thing or two from "Blame it on Rio".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The theme songs okay.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't connect with this film. I saw it during my raging hormone years, and back then it was a cheap thrill. Watching it now with a more mature mind I can't really see the attraction. I guess if you get married young, are a middle-aged male whose been married to the same person for a number of years, you may have felt you've missed out on life somewhere along the line. For any males viewing this, guess what, you haven't.To me this seems like a Shakespearean kind of play with a happy ending, in that no one dies or gets burned at the end in spite of all of the bed hopping. Still, not really my kind of film. The characters are a little one dimensional in a sex comic kind of way, but it is an entertaining watch all the same for what it is.The young girl with stars in her eyes finds herself attracted to an older man. Not really a match made in heaven, and repercussions resound. All in all kind of a strange film for what it is, really. Kind of light hearted in tone, but I can't imagine real people being as forgiving. In that way it seems rather, well, just crazy.But, like I say, at least the theme song is okay. Well shot, respectably acted, if you're a divorcée, then this might or might not help you get through the night.See it once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Caine at his Comic Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Caine delivers one of his best comic performances in this early-80's gem, set amid the tropical splendor of Rio de Janeiro. Caine is 43-year-old Matthew Hollins, who, on vacation in Rio, is dismayed to find himself in love(and having sex)with his best friend's gorgeous teenage daughter. Realizing the impossibility of their relationship, Matthew must break it off while trying to keep the secret from her father, Victor (a frantic-but-funny Joseph Bologna).Bologna is steady and solid, but can hardly keep up with old-pro Caine, who can express Matthew's quiet panic with just his sad eyes. It helps that Caine is provided with some snappingly funny lines by Larry Gelbart, who also wrote much of the repartee for television's "M*A*S*H". Imaginative complications ensue, but Caine steals the show while the rest of the cast is consigned to being straight men for Matthew's quips and omniscient narration.The familiar Michelle Johnson plays Victor's teen-aged daughter, Jennifer, with a breathless, hormonal cloud around her, but with a little too much melodrama. (On the other hand, teenage life is melodramatic.) A well-post-"Rhoda" Valerie Harper, as Karen, Matthew's cold, vacationing-separately wife, has what amounts to a bit part, though she's fun to watch during the final fifteen minutes. And a surprisingly subdued Demi Moore is interesting to re-visit in an early role as Matthew's morally-grounded teenage daughter, Nikki.This is a fun, Saturday night movie for a date with your wife, unless you have obvious issues with your nubile, teen-aged babysitter. If so, watch "Rio" without your wife and enjoy the scenery, the fantasy, and the consequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Guilty Pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is not a cinematic triumph at any interpretation of the word. It's filled with nudity and bad acting, especially on the part of the younger actors in it, but what can I say? As a longtime fan of Michael Caine, I will gladly see *almost* any film he does.Joe Bologna and the short appearance of Valerie Harper also show long time talent in the film, but for the most part, this film is farcical and funny, and full of irony so apparent, it will smack you in the face! There is little effort to make this film subtle by any means. The seduction of Michael Caine by the nubile young Michelle Johnson is clearly awkward--as it should be, but hell, once entangled in the web, Caine's character keeps on going, like the Energizer bunny!!The most fun part, for me, is Bologna's partnering with Caine to "discover" who the "older man" is who is having an affair with his daughter. Caine's superior acting ability manages to bring him through the discomfort that ensues.If you're uncomfortable with nudity in films, or films where an older man is supposedly having sex with a girl young enough to be his daughter, then don't bother seeing this film. But if you just want to suspend disbelief for awhile and enjoy a fun, satirical film, go for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blame it on Incest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In many ways, if you add in sex scenes, Blame it on Rio has the potential of being a soft-core adult movie. The subject matter is very risky for an early 80's comedy. Michael Caine stars in and puts his reputation on the line as the comedic element in this adult drama. Although comedy is thrown into the mix from time to time, Blame it on Rio is in many ways, a dark comedy. Much of the night scenes are in fact dark. Too dark to some standards, you can hardly make out the actors on screen. The beach scene alone could have been re-shot due to stupidity in the lighting department. Valerie Harper also makes an appearance alongside a very young Demi Moore who, unlike the eye candy of the movie, Michelle Johnson is reserved. Since Rio, Michelle Johnson slowly faded away, returning to do a small role from time to time. Her popularity from Rio could have and should have made her a top actress / ornament in Hollywood. Sadly, much like this movie, it has lost its strong youth audience to other movies with more nudity and less comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm not usually difficult for that type of movies. I like the type of movie that is so bad that it's entertaining and hilarious, but this one goes far beyond that. When I read the review of that movie, I expected a light-hearted Woody Allen-esque early 80's comedy, but I found out that it was one thing: softcore porn for middle-aged men. I don't see anything wrong with nudity in movies. I don't even have the problem with the may-december relationship in this movie that might seem sick to some people. Hey, I'm a teenager and I like older men myself. But maybe it's for that reason that I hated it so much, I hated it because I could tell how unrealistic it was. This movie is not one bit funny except for a few lines and it doesn't have that cheesy appeal that 80's movies usually have. That's why I'm not to excuse the fact that it's only a fantasy for middle-aged men. Aside from the male characters, the acting is horrible. The character of Jennifer is so unrealistic it hurts. The main character is a horribly plain man, physically AND in personality. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a superficial person, but there was just no way this girl could fall in love with that man. He was just an average middle-aged man.There's nothing much to say about this movie aside from that. Most people seem to have given it a 7, probably because they wish it would happen to them. But what can I say?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The heartbreak of unrequited love...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw "Blame It on Rio" in the late '80's and dismissed it as a skin flick. But now, I'm quite a bit older, and can see that it was much more.**SPOILERS AHEAD**What really makes this film unique is the power struggle between Michael Caine (Matthew) and the lovely Michelle Johnson (Jennifer). Johnson shines as a determined and sincere teen who has fallen for Caine. It's hard to describe how many levels this power struggle touches upon: Caine battles with his conscience throughout the affair, while keeping it secret from his best friend becomes more difficult. He waits and hopes for the right moment to tell his comrade about the liason, but it never arrives. Jennifer has a perfect counter for every one of Matthew's logical reason's to end the relationship. And at some points during the film, it seems as though she's winning, as Caine admits that he does lover her, and admits near the end that he wants to be with her.However, the mistakes in past relationships from Caine and Jennifer's father are the final nail in the coffin. Infidelity and deception untie the seams of security that Jennifer longed for, and even though the film doesn't say it outright, her whole world has come crashing down around her. It's at this point when I realized...no, I actually connected with Jennifer's disillusionment and pain. In a superficial environment, where sex and love flow freely, she was trying to rise above the norm and find true paradise. And perhaps this could even be a long standing comment on society as a whole. Somewhere amidst the casual sex, mobile short term affairs, and deception, there lies a community of sensitive and genuine souls like hers who constantly try for love but can't overcome the worst parts of sexual freedom created throughout the '60's and '7O's.This film is an underrated gem, to say the least...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blame It On Rio Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why would anyone review a 26-year-old film I saw long ago? At the time the film came out I was nearly Michael Caine's age and shared many of his mid-life frustrations about marriage and certainly enjoyed the fantasy about having an affair with a young woman my junior in exotic Rio. Over the past two decades things have changed. First, this movie would not have been made today, given Hollywood's Puritanical shift to the dark ages on a flat earth. Second, Blame It On Rio features what many current comedies do not offer: deep belly laughs well into the third act. Thirdly, movies are judged by ticket receipts today and not by laughs or remembered lines. Blame It On Rio exudes all that the movie was intended to convey. Sadly for Michelle Johnson, who received a Razzi Award for worst actress that year, she was unfairly judged by the Puritans and feminists. She played the part of a young seductress who tingled with run-away hormones, gorgeous loins and breasts; she was an entirely authentic mermaid capable of seducing any male of age and taking him into the surf. I was in Rio recently, and yes, spells endure in this marvellous city because of a special magic that Blame It On Rio managed to catch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Packed with great one-liners!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies of all time.I say that not because it has any particular social significance, is thought-provoking, has Oscar-worthy performances (except perhaps Michael Caine), etc. I say that because it is fun to watch! This is due largely to the many one-liners and snippets of dialogue about the situation that evolves. But it is important to point out that the dialogue likely would not have worked had it not been for the impeccable timing and delivery on the part of Michael Caine. Mr. Caine is clearly one of the best actors of all time and had his part been played by anyone else, the movie likely would have been a total flop in my book.I am a sucker for great one-liners and this movie was full of them.Some people might find the topic of this movie inappropriate, distasteful, or perverted, but I just don't see any justification for that. We're talking about consenting adults here - this is not "Pretty Baby". Fortunately this movie does not take itself as seriously as some viewers might.The performances of Michael Caine, Valerie Harper, and Joseph Bologna were strong, with a very strong lead by Mr. Caine. Michelle Johnson was perhaps the weakest actor in the film, but there was something about her amateurish delivery that contributed to the film. Somehow it made her character more believable. If that was your plan all along, Ms. Johnson, my most sincere apologies. Although Demi Moore was a stronger actress, I felt like she was a bit of a wet dish rag throughout most of the movie. Yeah, she was supposed to be the smart, practical one, but it would have been nice to have seen more signs of life come from that important character.We go to movies for a variety of reasons, but for me one of the primary reasons is to be entertained. This movie did just that. The dialogue is hilarious with great delivery by Michael Caine and others. I will admit that I was mesmerized by the striking beauty of Michelle Johnson. I saw that she got a Razzie for her performance, but I find that unfortunate. She might not have been an actor's actor, but I can't help but feel that she had some potential. I always wanted to see her in more serious movies (even with her clothes on). Today I'm flagging some of her more recent films as Must See on IMDb. I haven't seen her in anything mainstream since "Rio" and I'd like to see how she has progressed.This is a favorite of mine and if you are looking for some funny dialogue about a provocative, but funny situation, you might enjoy it too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...like they used to. Or, at the very least, like BLAME IT ON RIO.One of my best friends, MM, and I saw this at least a million times back in the day when theaters were creative in bringing people in; one of the local mall theaters even went so far as to have ONE dollar Tuesday nights! But I digress.There is a charm about BIOR that makes the current crop of Hollywood tentpoles look like the crass, movie-by-numbers product they truly are. The first thing to note is the top rate talent of Donen, Gelbart and Villalobos, seasoned pros all from the golden era of film-making (or one of them).There aren't explosions, CGI (there was no CGI then to speak of) or smarmy twenty-something dialog that's "hipper than you could ever hope to be." Instead, solid acting by a professional cast, a stunning looker in Michelle Johnson, and witty dialog fill the screen.Improbable? Maybe. Entertaining? Definitely. BIOR is an 80's throwback to the earlier golden age of screwball comedies with an update of sex and taboo while never crossing over to the obscene - it's tame by today's standards. But at it's heart lies, dare I say it, an innocence that speaks not only of the times then, but stands in stark contrast to the calculated assembly line movies of today's corporate movie machine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)Drippy for the most part. One has to blush for Michael Caine who is miscast as a middle aged man who gets seduced by his best friend's daughter while on vacation in Rio De Janeiro. I had the sense that Brazilian Airlines, or whoever, and the Brazilian tourist bureau fronted the funds for this turkey.Perhaps some old boys club as well since this is fantasy wish fulfillment for middle-aged men, pure and simple. This was supposed to be a comedy, a remake of the Claude Berri French film entitled One Wild Moment (1978), but the laughs really don't materialize (there are a few chuckles), and anyway you practically have to be French to make this sort of tale work. Either that or play it full out as a farce.Nonetheless, there must have been some reason I kept watching, since I have no desire to see Michael Caine make a fool of himself (in those huge, ugly glasses with the plastic brown frames), and that reason is Michelle Johnson, who does the seducing. She is very pretty and delightfully sexy and so beguiling that I almost believe her.But enough about my fantasies. Joseph Bologna plays the girl's father and Caine's best friend in his usual cynical, wise-cracking style, kind of like the low rent Mafia boss/used car salesman persona that he wears so well. Demi Moore has a small part as Caine's daughter, but there is no evidence here to account for her becoming a box office star in the nineties. Valerie Harper plays Caine's wife, who is sick of him and his lack of demonstrativeness and goes on a separate vacation. Caine's superb timing and great concentration as an actor are in evidence, but somehow he just doesn't quite make it as a poor sap who is torn between lust and propriety.Stanley Donen (Singing in the Rain (1952), The Pajama Game (1957), Charade (1963), Indiscreet (1958), etc.) directed and was clearly off his best form or past his prime. Or maybe he just wanted to indulge himself an old guy's daydream.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Caine's character has problems. He's a plain, nearsighted, insecure man in his mid-40s. He's married but his wife doesn't seem to love him anymore. He has a poor relationship with his only daughter. But his most immediate problem is that a stunningly beautiful young woman, played by Michelle Johnson, is pursuing him too ardently, kissing him, groping him, and trying to initiate sex at every opportunity. What's the poor fellow to do? This movie should be taken out of the Comedy section and placed under Science Fiction. Only an intergalactic brain chip can explain the actions of Michelle Johnson's character. Let's see - 3 billion men in the world - she can pretty much have her pick - she goes with an clumsy, aging loser. This goes beyond a middle-aged male fantasy into something so delusional, you just hope that everyone involved voluntarily submitted to therapy.There's not really anything funny here. There are some quick attempts at wit from Caine, who often seems to playing Hawkeye Pierce more than a new character. Joseph Bologna is like fingernails on a chalkboard. Michelle Johnson is no actress - she has one crying scene that wouldn't pass muster in a high school play - but she is beautiful and she does take her clothes off. So buy the DVD, skip to scenes 4 and 9, and forget the rest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the worse films I ever saw. You can not call it a love story. Let's call it what it is, a dirty old man falls for a girl young enough to be his daughter. She takes her shirt off several times, for no other purpose than to just confirm this is a piece of trash.I don't have much else to say about this film, but they won't publish this unless I write ten lines. So at the risk of repeating myself, please don't bother to rent this film unless you are in the mood for trash. The only people that will like this are old men who can fantasize that they too, can lust after young girls and the girl will be responsive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Caine, in every performance I see him in cements himself as an actor for all time. The guy is so smooth, so, right in just about everything he does, that I wish there were more like him. In "Blame it on Rio" he plays a married, middle aged man in a marriage that may be on its last legs. He and a wonderful Joe Bologna set off on a trip to Brazil with each other's daughters in tow. When things heat up between Caine and the much younger (and may I say Unbelievably HOT) 18 year old daughter of his best friend, the laughs ensue. The script fires on all cylinders as you laugh out loud at some of the one liners and hilarious situations these people find themselves in. Towards the end the movie becomes slightly serious, but on the whole its a comedy for people that enjoy good comedic writing. (So lost nowadays!) I found myself bursting out in fits of laughter especially when Caine and Bologna are wrestling and the silent maid walks in. Really funny stuff, well played by all. Highly Recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great 80s Flashback</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just love this movie. My wife and I watch it over and over. It is a great flashback to the early 80s with some good awkward comedic moments. Michael Caine is great as always. Michelle Johnson is a disaster as an actress, but it works for this high school girl crush role she is in being cute and well defined enough to fit the role. It's fun to see Demi Moore before she was anything and Valerie Harper brings back shades of Mary Tyler Moore. Joseph Bologna is another disaster of an actor, but again puts the right spin on this role. Anyone should enjoy this light hearted romantic comedy, but watch out for some excessive nudity throughout, not for the faint of heart on that front. Other than that, it is as pure as it gets from the early 80s. Fun in the sun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a bit to bland.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This looked like it had potential when I rented it. The movie looked cute and fun and I was really looking forward to seeing it. But the only word that comes across in reviewing it is "bland." The movie's buildup is extremely slow and it lost me almost from the beginning, because there was none of the wit and sense of fun I expected when I decided to watch it.I have seen a lot of Demi Moore pics, a few I thought were outstanding, however this is not one of them and it remains one of the more missable ones. There is absolutely nothing memorable about this at all. Might be OK if there is absolutely nothing else of interest on, otherwise skip it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Caine?! Good God, man!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could see Demi Moore in a film like this. (Striptease, anyone?) Moore has made more bad films than Ed Wood, and her acting is just as bad. So it doesn't surprise me that she can be found here, alongside newcomer Michelle Johnson. But Michael Caine? What were you thinking? For an award winning actor, this is too much waste.As a matter of fact, Caine's performance here isn't half bad, which is what can be expected of him. He's pretty good in almost anything. But a stupid storyline, terrible acting on everyone else's part, and a ho-hum job at filming/directing all sink this one deeper than the Titanic.Blame It On Rio? Blame it on Stanley Donen, for sure.My Rating: 1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evil incest fantasy, and it's not even funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two middle-aged, bored, unhappy, American men have affairs with each other's underage daughters. The script tries to excuse it with the Rio setting and by making the girls unrealistically sexually aggressive. Supposed to be a comedy, but completely devoid of laughs. Proof positive that Michael Caine can get away with ANYTHING, I still like him even after seeing this!Also of interest to film historians for the good look at Demi Moore's original bosom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for American tastes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brasilians are a beautiful, happy, open people, and Brasil is a truly beautiful country. I believe that Dohen and cast were indeed working under the spell of their exotic location, and that Americans, ignorant and repressed, are incapable of understanding the freeness in this region of the world.In my 20s when I first found this movie, it was almost hypnotic to me; I watched it probably a dozen times, and no it had nothing to do with the breasts. In time it fell from my memory. Then, in my 30s, I fell in love with and married a beautiful Brasilian. More than a year later I saw the movie title on cable, recorded it, and was shocked upon realizing that this movie was shot in my wife's country of birth. The spirit that is in this movie is the spirit that is in my wife. Those of you who can't see past the skin and the happiness and the openness that is the Brasilian way of life because of your upbringing, please, please, watch something more to your taste; Pilgrim's Progress for instance.Blame it on Rio is not not a great comedy, but it is greatly redeemed by its location, its spirit and some inspired humor. * * * (out of 4 stars).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Innocuous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two friends (Michael Caine, Joe Bologna) go to Rio with their daughters (Michelle Johnson, Demi Moore) for a month. Bologna is getting divorced and Caine is having problems with his wife (Valerie Harper). While there, Johnson seduces Caine and immediately thinks she's in love with him. He's attracted to her too, but there's over 20 years age difference and it's his best friends daughter...Saw this in a art house theatre (!!!) back in 1984. I vaguely remember finding it pleasant. I saw it last night and my feelings have totally changed. The scenery is beautiful and the movie is full of innocuous female nudity but this is basically just a bad movie. The script is horrible--full of sniggering sex jokes and dreadful one liners--it's on the level of a bad TV sitcom. It's way too long for it's own good and it's very dull. All the beautiful scenery in the world couldn't help this.Caine is just great; Johnson is OK; Bologna, Moore and Harper are just horrible.Some people think this movie is so bad that it's funny but I think it's too dull for that. This gets a 4 for Caine and Rio itself.</fullReview>
