		<shortDescription>Dirty + Rotten = Genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film made an impression on me before I even saw it. I was in a theater, and a trailer for "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" came on. While a voice-over talked about the value of movies promoting morality and civility, you saw Martin and Caine strolling along a beachfront, smiling beneficently as they greet passers-by. Then Caine shoved cotton candy into a kids face while Martin pushed a woman off a ledge.It's a great sequence, and is featured on the DVD with its own commentary from director Frank Oz (when has that ever happened before?) but a little misleading. Actually, while both men are scoundrels, neither is quite that vile. Caine's Lawrence Jamieson is actually a bit of an altruist, as we find out, with a code of only taking in people who can afford to be taken, and finding ways of spending the money that are not entirely self-serving. Martin's Freddy Benson is less disciplined and more small-time in his cons; he'll steal candy from a baby and tell you it's for his poor sick Gram-Gram if caught, but he is likeable, too, an underdog with little idea how the game is played at the highest levels, but eager to learn.The fact you can like these characters is a compliment to Martin and Caine, as well as director Oz and the team of writers. Tone is everything with a film like this, and as Oz says in his commentary, so important in making the comedy work. He notes he was going for a 1950s feel in the picture, I'm guessing with Hitchcock's "To Catch A Thief" in mind. The great score by Miles Goodman is solid enough to deserve its own CD reissue, with an air of light sophistication that buoys the proceedings on screen. Most importantly, since much of the comedy involves people taking advantage of one another, having everything put forward in such a gossamer manner helps you digest the story without leaving a bad taste.Martin shines in many scenes, especially when playing Ruprecht the idiot man-child and when stuck in jail trying to remember the name of the only man he thinks can bail him out ("James Lawrenceton...no, wait, James Jesterton....no, no, it's definitely, um...") I knew Martin could be funny, and with the exception of "All Of Me" this is probably his best comedic performance, but Caine is a revelation. A straight man, yes, but with delicate timing and some clever characterizations that he pulls out of a bag, like an Germanic psychiatrist with some unusual ideas about curing lameness. You forget how good Caine is in comedy, despite his performances in films like this, "Blame It On Rio," and "Without A Clue." Glenne Headly is a revelation as the woman caught in the middle of Jamieson and Benson's scheming, every bit as good as her male counterparts, but say no more.Great actors, great tone, but the plot is the best thing this film has. It's a remake of a 1964 film "Bedtime Story," which teamed Marlon Brando and David Niven for what should have been a dream team but went flat instead. This time, the script is helped by actors who can not only deliver funny lines but make them funnier, and by an ending (according to Oz in his commentary, one worked out over several long dinner meetings with Martin) that is simply perfect.Finally, Oz needs to be recognized. He was only making his second non-Muppet film here, but the result in my view is one of the best comedies anyone has ever done. He manages to get the best from everyone, including the actors and cinematographer Michael Ballhaus (some amazing night shots of the French Rivera waterfront you never tire of looking at), and delivers a rare jewel of a film, a laugh-out-loud comedy that leaves you with a warm feeling inside.Ian McDairmid plays Arthur the butler in this, teaming him with Oz yet again. Almost titled this review "Yoda And Palpatine On The French Riviera;" it's interesting McDairmid plays the one guy in "Scoundrels" who's really on the level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a film! "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" has a really clever plot, in which Lawrence, a high-class playboy (Michael Caine), and Freddy, a petty con man (Steve Martin), make their living by seducing and cheating rich ladies. However, the little French town is too small for both, so they decide to set up a bet in which the loser has to clear the area. Pretty and naive Janet (Glenn Headly) is the object of their contest, and each one of them engages in ever-more ingenious tricks to try to rip her off and win the bet, yet with unpredictable results.The movie is hilarious, and despite its 15 years' of age, it is as fresh as it has been when it was first produced. Steve Martin of course is the funniest character of all, with his fantastic "Ruprecht" performance being unforgettable. Go ahead and enjoy this film. It is worth it! 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything clicks in this laugh-out-loud gem. Steve Martin and Michael Caine are in top form as Freddy Benson and Lawrence Jamieson, two con men who agree that this town (on the French Mediterranean coast) ain't big enough for the both of them. To solve the problem, they agree upon a solution - the first man to swindle $50,000 from a naive young woman gets to stay. The competition brings out the very best of their very worst, with Martin posing as a paraplegic and Caine as a psychiatrist eager to help convince him it's all in his head. Glenne Headly, as the target of the cons, deserves special mention for her brilliant performance.One of the strongest assets of "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" is that the story is interesting enough, with its various twists and turns, that it would work great even without being funny. The laughs - and there are many of them - are a sort of gut-hurting bonus. The scene in which Caine tests the nerves in Martin's legs must rank as one of the most uproarious in film history. This one from director Frank Oz (certainly no slouch in the comedy department) is not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remake of 1964's 'Bedtime Story' (written by comedy genius Paul Henning) moves right along with Michael Caine and Steve Martin sharing duties as professional opportunists one-upping each other in a conquest contest.It's a sort of Martin and Lewis pairing, and, although the comedy is derivative, it's by no means boring or stale, likely due to the talent of the two marvelous leads.Wonderful European landscapes are a bonus.Well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Winning Comedy from the Land of Oz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Frank Oz landed the dream team from comedic heaven when Steve Martin and Michael Caine signed on to star in this hilarious comedy of manners and mannerisms, `Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,' a film that manages to be entertaining without being offensive in any way, and features some terrific performances and-- filmed on location in the French Riviera-- some beautiful cinematography by Michael Ballhaus. Made in 1988, this film not only holds up well, but seems so refreshing after a decade of `American Pies' and other such fare featuring one witless, forgettable `talent' after another. It's a reminder that true comedy can have sophistication without necessarily being sophisticated, and that real humor is timeless. This is stuff that was good when it was made, is even better today, and will have you laughing even harder at it twenty, thirty or fifty years from now.Freddy Benson (Martin) is a small time American con man/aspiring gigolo traveling abroad with his sights set on the Riviera, specifically Beaumont Sur Mer, which he understands is easy pickings for a talent such as his. Why, on the train into town alone, he bilks a compassionate young woman out of dinner and twenty dollars, using the old I'm-saving-up-for-my-dear-old-grandmother's-operation ploy. On that same train, however, observing Freddy's operation from across the aisle, is Lawrence Jamieson (Caine), a big time con artist/gigolo, who as it happens, lives in Beaumont Sur Mer. And instantly, Jamieson looks upon Freddy with disdain; after all, this is a man who has perfected the art of bilking rich young women for sums that fall into five and six digits by successfully masquerading as a Prince or some such Nobility, who needs vast sums of money in order to `save' his country from the Communists, an unspecified opposition, or whatever else will work. Furthermore, it's taken a lot of time and effort to get to where he's at, and he's not about to let the unseemly Freddy Benson cut into his act.So with the help of his associate ( a local policeman), Inspector Andre (Anton Rodgers), Jamieson sets out to `discourage' Freddy from attempting to get a foothold in Beaumont Sur Mer. But Freddy, it turns out, may not be the unwitting amateur Jamieson presumed him to be-- Andre has just received word that an elusive con artist has arrived in the area; a professional known only as `The Jackal.' And so, the game is afoot; a game that will ultimately bring Jamieson and Freddy closer together, and involve them with a wealthy American named Janet Colgate (Glenne Headly), who will become the focus of more than just a little attention before it's all over. it becomes a contest between the suave Lawrence Jamieson and the unruly Freddy Benson. And the winner? Well, by the end it's clear who the real winner is here-- and without a doubt, it's the audience.Oz must have had a good time making this movie, because he had all the tools available to him from the best of both worlds. There's the broad, physical humor employed and perfectly delivered by Martin, and the subtle, studied approach that Caine uses. Their styles contrast wonderfully, and Oz certainly makes the most of it. He's put together some scenes that are beyond hilarious, like the one in which Lawrence attempts tutoring Freddy in the art of being suave and sophisticated; or when-- as part of a scam-- Freddy takes on the role of `Ruprecht,' Lawrence's incorrigible, moronic brother. It's in these scenes that Oz seems to give Martin, especially, some free reign, and the rewards are substantial. And it's definitely a joint effort on the part of the two stars; Martin is funny, but it's Caine's response to him that really makes it work. It also demonstrates that Oz knows his territory, and proceeds accordingly.Caine gives a performance that presents Jamieson as the epitome of charm and experience, in the grand tradition of the likes of David Niven and Cary Grant. This is one smooth operator, and the fact that he lives by a personal `code' that only allows him to bilk the very rich (and only if they `deserve' it), enables you to like him for who and what he is. He's not a guy who's going to let a mark sell the family furniture and car to invest in one of his schemes; call him a con man with scruples. And Caine plays him to perfection.Martin, however, is the one who really gets to cut loose in the role of Freddy, and without question, he does physical comedy better than anyone since Buster Keaton or Chaplin. Martin can get a laugh just by walking into a room. He invests Freddy with a less than retiring manner, and takes it over the top in his guise as Ruprecht, using his entire body as a vehicle through which he expresses this particular bit of lunacy. And seeing him in action is an absolute riot. As he did so successfully in his stand-up days, Martin parlays a facial expression combined with the most erratic movements of his arms and legs into a visual image that can be indescribably funny. He's one of the select few actor/comedians with a true and innate sense of real comedy, and moreover, he knows how to sell it to his audience.As the seemingly hapless Janet, Headly does a good job, but it's a role that may have been more conducive to the likes of Melanie Griffith or even Diane Keaton, either of whom would've given the character a decidedly different spin.The supporting cast includes Barbara Harris (Fanny), Ian McDiarmid (Arthur) and Dana Ivey (Mrs. Reed). Funny and thoroughly entertaining, `Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,' with it's contrasting comedic styles and polished presentation, is a minor classic in it's own right. A winner from the Land of Oz, wherein Caine and Martin are the reigning Royalty, this is one comedy that will definitely continue to withstand the test of time. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In A Word: Hilarious!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't watch this movie often enough. The few times I've seen it over the years provide superior entertainment, but it's a film I seem to forget about. That shouldn't be the case: it's a terrific movie. I've never met anyone who did NOT like this movie. It seems to appeal to a lot of people, young and old. The three leads - Steve Martin, Michael Caine and Glenn Headley - were all in top form, on top of their "game," so to speak.Martin's facial expressions and physical humor are terrific and Caine played his part magnificently, too. I enjoy Caine much more in here than Martin (and in most films) but Steve seems to have the funniest moments in this movie. At any rate, both are superb as antagonists "Lawrence Jamison" (Caine) and "Freddie Benson" (Martin). The two men have the talent to pull off slapstick as well as subtle comedy. Headley, as "Janet Colgate," meanwhile, is a joy to watch and to listen to, with that sweet voice of hers. I can't say more about her without giving away too much but she is not only the objection of attention in the movie, but the key character. These three combine for almost a laugh-a-minute.This also is a good example of how to make a modern-day comedy without all the sleaze and profanity. There is some in here, but not much. Why most comedies do not follow this lead is a sad question. It's still an adult movie about con men, not a film teens and below would enjoy. Frank Oz, who directed other pretty clean-and-funny movies, directed this one.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" is no longer a new film, but it's not showing its age, which I guess is a sign of a classic. I've seen it recently, and was not expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised!With performances by can't-fail actors Steve Martin and Michael Caine, the film is zany, with a little toilet humor but mostly doesn't insult one's intelligence, and is far better than "All of Me" and just short of "A Fish Called Wanda", and "Roxanne", which unlike this film includes some romance.Who should see this film:-- Zany comedy film lovers: a must-see. If you're new toSteve Martin, try Bowfinger first.-- Safe as a kids / family filmI'll give "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" a surprisingly resilient 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is no classic, but I really enjoyed this movie. I've seen too many mediocre "con artist" comedies (i.e., "Two Much", "Opportunity Knocks", etc.) and it's nice to see one that works well. The two leads were great. The dialogue is fabulous. The pace is perfect - it keeps your attention without moving too fast. The script is hilarious. I have no complaints about this movie. Rent it for a lot of laughs.If, however, you don't like this movie (and I don't see how that's possible), you should still stay till the end. The ending is marvelously done, one of the funniest surprise endings since "The Sting" (another fabulous con artist comedy).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Changes Improve the Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1964 Marlon Brando made the film BEDTIME STORY with David Niven and Shirley Jones, about the battle between two rival con-artists on the Riviera, to determine who was going to be the local king of the racket in running the town. It was a good comedy, but while it demonstrated (as TEAHOUSE OF THE AUGUST MOON had) that Brando was an accomplished comic when he wanted to be, somehow it was not as good as it could have been. Yet Brando, Niven, and Jones did excellent work in it.The film was remade in 1988 as DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS, with the leads played by Steve Martin, Michael Caine, and Glenne Headley. The general feeling is that if the original was a good comedy, the remake was all-around an excellent one.Brando's "Freddy Benson" ran a small con-game racket pretending to be a soldier trying to get money for his grandmother's operation in the U.S. Brando would target young American ladies who were traveling on trains on the Italian - French border, and take them for small sums. But he hoped to go after richer game. The richer game were targeted by Niven's "Lawrence Jamieson", who got large sums from wealthy women who were willing to finance a counter-revolution in a fictitious country he is exiled king of. Niven, of course, does not want competition. He tries to work with Brando for awhile, but Brando strains at the restraint of his distinctly junior partner position. So they agree to a con-artist test on the first subject that comes along: whoever takes her for $10,000.00 will be the winner. Along comes Jones' who they think is the heiress to a soap fortune, and they go after her. In the end, she is not an heiress, and Brando and she go back to America as husband and wife. Niven resigns himself to the sad lonely life of the elite on the Riviera.SPOILERS COMING UP The 1988 version changed the characterizations a bit. Niven sees himself as a patron of the arts, because he was not very good in any of them but now has the money to help support people. Caine does too, but his interest is more controlled - more of a hobby really. He is an organized conman and he has set up a first rate system with his valet and the local police chief. Martin's "Freddie" is far dumber and sloppier than Brando's. He practices the same con-games, and tries to rise above that nonsense, but he lacks any grace to do so. In fact, he blackmails his way into Caine's establishment to become a gentleman conman, and is kept only as an idiot. So was Brando, but Brando was intelligent to see he was being wasted. Martin is just demanding.Certain things were improved by the changes. Shirley Jones was a total innocent who was brought into the Caine - Martin rivalry as a dupe. Glenne Headley's character is more devious, as it turns out, and improves the atmosphere of plot, counter-plot, counter - counter-plot that runs the script. It also enables the conclusion of the story to involve all three principals instead of just one (Caine in place of Niven). And, as it turns out, Headley has as low an opinion of Martin's intelligence as Caine does, even if they will be working together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was taken by surprise to see 59 comments on this illusively long-forgotten movie. The first surprise is that IMDb will come to 14 years old this October and it was produced in 1988. Picture this, it's not a blockbuster of the epoch like "Titanic" that everyone remembers well.The second surprise is that it should be in the late 80's or early 90's that it was televised once only by a local English TV channel. Thanks and praises be to God for giving us an amazingly created brain. Vaguely I just could remember a small part of the plot and some English words shown on the screen. With the great help of the awesome invention named internet, yesterday I keyed in solely "con-men", "card", "jackal" and "movie" on the searching engine and swiftly I found its trail! Bravo.The third surprise comes to its popularity. From 1999 to 2004, people keep on writing comments on this movie. Its DVD release in 1997 and 2001 should have helped a lot.The fourth surprise is the sterling male cast. Steve Martin and Michael Caine! But how come I have forgotten them totally but Glenne Headly's acting, not her name or face (sorry, sorry). The two men were not in my memory repository. I only remember their clumsy and ridiculous actions but not their names or faces.What I remember is an older dapper man of regal air poses himself as a man of nobility or of a certain European royal house. He manipulates the Americans' "European royal family complex" and cajoles a blond American lady woman into giving him a large sum of money by majestically telling her that he is going to get back his lost country and much money is needed for a coup d'état. As for the younger chap, in my memory, he is nothing but a silly guy in many ways.It is true that some Caucasian Americans, especially those living at East Coast where Europeans influence still has its way, fall for Europe obsessively. The evidence is obvious. In Disney world, many cartoon motion pictures are derived from European fairy tales (or children literature) where there are numerous good-looking princes and princesses living in magnificent castles. Mermaid, Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty etc are all typical choices. When they are still young kids, most Americans read about these stories day after day like cronies. In real world, they cannot find these glamorous characters in their own hometown but the original lands of their ancestors: Europe. Therefore, it is normal that some Americans has a high liking for Europe, they dream about it, they fantasize about it.Talking about the relationship between the USA and each country in Europe, the Anglo-American (Amerigo-British?) friendship cum rivalry is the most treacherous. The British envy Americans' money, troops and technology while across the Atlantic, the Americans desire the Brits' class, tradition and customs. One dialogue in "The Parents Trap" where younger Lindsay Lohan plays the separated-since-birth twins elucidates the theory. Hallie Parker (the USA twin) asks the never-seen Annie James (the UK twin), 'You wanna know the "real" difference between us?' Annie hurriedly retorts, 'Let me see... I have class and you don't...' That's why Michael Caine can be such a successful con-man.It is exactly Glenne Headly's acting makes the day and makes the surprising twist at the end. GH is endowed with great thespian flair but strangely she still hasn't had her day yet. She appears to be a good-natured and innocent-looking rich American heiress who wins the hearts of both the young and the old con-men. Viewers may think, "Oh, poor girl, another victim of the scoundrels." Later, the two guys find her down-and-out in deep distress because she is cheated by an unknown con-man and helped him with all her money. She even tells her father's teaching that trying hard to help people is a virtue.Even the seasoned and very experienced Michael Caine is trapped by her perfect scheme and gives her monetary help. The ending is the most unforgettable. "Oh! 'Diamond cuts diamond', what a game!" is what MC's face tells when he meets GH again in their hangout, a French Mediterranean coastal town. Leading a group of her potential victims (tourists), she is dressed in a nice suit, sun-glassed, speaking Aussie English to the two men when they approach her, "Fellas, last year I made three million dollars, but your fifty thousand was the most fun. Are you ready? Then let's go get 'em." She crosses her arms with them on each side, with smug, scheming and triumphant smile on each face, they walk towards the innocent herd of sheep.And their tricky game plays on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This comedy happens to be one of my personal funniest movies of all time. I love the way the surprising twists and turns create hilariously funny situations which are the reflections of two characters' personalities. I think Michael Caine and Steve Martin were perfect for this type of humor; they are great together on the screen.Lawrence (Michael Caine) and Freddie (Steve Martin) are con-men who live off women; the former - big-time, pretending to be a King in the Exile and residing in a charming Mediterranean French town, the latter is good conning women into giving him small sums of money or buying him a dinner. The town is not big enough for them to work together. They agree to a "winner stays, loser leaves" bet. Enters American visitor - rich heiress Janet Colgate (Glenn Headly), sweet and naive young woman.Glen Headly - an intelligent, attractive actress more than held her own opposite Caine and Martin. It is easy to first overlook her work but after the movie is over, you realize how effortless, artful, and complicated her performance is. Last time, when I caught the movie on TV, my husband joined me and watching Glen Headly on the screen for what could easily be the tenth time, he asked me how she did it. Perhaps, the art of How they do it not only What they do keeps me glued to the screen every time DRS is on.Highly enjoyable, sparkling, witty, and hilarious gem of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OOOookk-laaaa-HOMA, Oklahoma! Oklahoma! Okalhoma! Oklahoma!From the very beginning, it is obvious that Freddy (Steve Martin) Benson is up to no good. He is a smarmy, sappy, obvious little cheat who will do anything to elicit money from unsuspecting women. Lawrence (Michael Caine) Jamieson is a smooth, polished gentleman with breeding and culture, who also will say anything to elicit money from unsuspecting women.The difference is, while Freddy is conning a young lady out of a free meal, Jamieson is conning several middle-aged heiresses of their family fortunes, one check and/or piece of family jewelry at a time.Janet (Glenne Headly) Colgate is next on the agenda for them both, and when Freddy discovers Jamieson is extremely wealthy from his talents, he endeavors to have him teach him, groom him; style him into the sophisticated con artist as is Mr. Jamieson. But Freddy just does not have the same style and background as Mr. Jamieson, and therefore cannot bear the same finished product as he. The result leads to a certain enmity between the two men, precipitating a contest. Whoever gets Ms. Colgate into bed first, wins. But Jamieson, being too suave and debonair for a wager such as this one, agrees on the bet not to win, only that Benson will fail. So the bet is on, and the amusement sets in. Who wins? Watch the movie and see for yourself.Very nicely told comedy/drama directed by Frank Oz. I thoroughly enjoy this movie, but I think I watch it solely for the scene in which Ruprect asks to use the bathroom first. That scene is so appalling as to make me laugh out loud every time I see it. While this movie is a bit campy, and does rely on a tiny bit of 9-year-old humor, it is very entertaining and makes me laugh no matter how many times I've seen it. You can't say that about many movies. It rates a 7.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How on earth did this movie get a 6.7 on the ratings scale? Read the comments, this is one of the funniest and most intelligent comedies ever, remake or not. When you can watch a film 20, 30 times and still find it funny 15 years after it was first released how is that not a classic?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Great Overlooked Comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is so smart, so imaginative and so artfully played that it flew over the radar of the average movie-goer when it first came out. Michael Caine is at his brilliant best as the suave Laurence Jamison and Steve Martin's 'Ruprecht' is a comic masterpiece. As Freddy, he's the perfect boob -- smart enough to con women into giving him small sums of money, too stupid to realize there's a world going on around him where the stakes are much, much higher. It is also easy to underestimate the work of Glenn Headly, but once you've seen the whole movie you realize how her simple choices add up to a very complicated performance indeed. Every time I see this movie I laugh out loud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I managed to see this haphazourdly as the Late Movie one Friday. I have to admit, I'm usually not a fan of Steve Martin's strand of comedy (sorry fans :(), but I quite liked Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. The characters were interesting, the story-line quite unique and the humour consistently funny. I loved the character of Ruprecht (apologies for spelling) but also Martin's over-the-top performance as the troubled soldier. The constant tug-of-war between Caine's debanoir conman and Martin's cheesy overdone con were really terrific. Don't be hesitant. I admit it's not a flick I wouldn't usually see either, but it was fantastic none-the-less. 8 out of 10 :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film definitely ranks in my top 20. It's a very funny comedy and my choice for Steve Martin's best effort. His skillful physical comedy adds to a witty script, yet, for once, he never overdoes it. A sophisticated Michael Caine is the perfect complement. The plot twists aren't ground breaking, but they should make you smile. And some scenes have me laughing out loud, even though I've probably seen this film 10 times.The film is beautifully shot and the scenery is gorgeous. See this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We saw this movie the day it came out. Later that day we went back and paid to see it again. Michael Caine demonstrating the art of using greasy hair gel, Steve Martin playing an aw shucks novice con man, and Glenne Headley playing them both- this could be nothing, but these performers were definitely having a good day, and they are brilliant.The beautiful Mediterraneans setting legitimizes the story- fantasy- the viewer is placed right in the action, on the train, on the beach, in the mansion and grounds. We are taken along for the ride, but we enjoy an immunity the characters don't. This special viewpoint I think is why the movie works so well.Final comment: see it, and kiss the ground these actors walk on!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a very good movie that I enjoyed watching a lot. Steve Martin is one of my favorite actors. It's about to con-men that are competing with each other. They are competing over who can extract $50,000 from a clueless tourist.This movie also has a very funny and unpredictable twist at the end. I believe that the movie's ending is one of the most crucial parts, because if a great movie has a bad ending then you leave the theater and the ending is the most recent thing that you remember happening. This movie had a good ending. It also had good acting, for all three of the actors played their roles well and were perfectly cast. It also had an intelligent and funny plot.I reccommend that you see this movie. While you may not think of it as one of your favorites, I'm sure that you will genuinely enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>whatever happened to the funny comedies of the '80s?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is a wonderful '80s comedy, the type we don't see any longer. Today the humor, for the most part, is vulgar. For some reason, in the '80s, comedies were actually funny.Michael Caine and Steve Martin are two con man who wind up competing on the Riviera. Caine is a classy con man, Lawrence Jamieson, targeting rich widows as he sports different accents claiming he's funding a revolution for his country, helping the poor, the hungry, etc. Martin is Freddy Benson, lower class but after the same targets.Freddy asks Lawrence to tutor him in the art of the high-class con. Freddy doesn't want him around as he feels the Riviera isn't big enough for both of them. Freddy, however, isn't leaving. So they agree on a bet. The first one to strip a young heiress (Glenne Headly) of $50,000 stays, and the other leaves.What follows is hilarious. Both men are at the top of their game here. Steve Martin can make you laugh with a facial expression. The scene where he attempts to "walk" after being in a wheelchair is a riot. Caine as Lawrence is brilliant as a suave sophisticate, and his getting the better of Freddy in several scenes is a delight. The end has a neat twist.This film was adapted into a successful Broadway musical, and it is opening in London starring Robert Lindsay ("My Family"). It's a fun story. Wish today we had more like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Martin &amp; Caine are as good as Brando &amp; Niven were</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" is remake of great old comedy "Bedtime Story", from director Frank Oz. Lawrence (Michael Caine) and Freddie (Steve Martin) are charlatans; and they realize that one town (Beaumont sur Mer) is small for both of them. So they decide to make a bet: the first one who gets $50.000 from a young lady wins, loser leaves town. Soon they find perfect target, young and rich Janet Colgate (Glenne Headly). This kind of comedy works because of actors and Oz managed to pick the right people. Caine and Martin are as good as Brando are Niven were. And I also have to praise Glenne Headly. There are so many jokes that makes this movie memorable and very good remake too. Frank Oz showed that he is capable of making great comedies ("What About Bob?", "In &amp; Out"... to his newest "Death at a Funeral"). I wish that all comedies were funny like this one and all directors should learn from this movie. Cause this is recipe for successful comedy: good actors, great plot, capable direction and twist at the end. What more can you ask from a movie that is meant to entertain you?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsophisticated slick comedy that is quite fun without being brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American conning women for free meals and small change. Worried that this small poacher will frighten off the bigger game, Lawrence tries to get rid of Freddy but, like a bad penny he keeps coming back. A chance encounter with one of Lawrence's marks means Freddy catches on that Lawrence is just like him albeit on a bigger scale and he returns to the Riviera to confront him. With neither man willing to back off, they settle on a gentleman's bet to fleece the first woman they see ? with the one to pull off a successful con winning the right to stay and live well off rich women.With a twisty plot that is, ultimately, predictable, this film is less about the destination of the story but more about the comedy of each scene. On this level the film works pretty well because it manages to keep producing consistent amusement from start to shortly before the finish. I say shortly before the ending because near the end the predictable becomes very obvious and I felt like I was waiting for the film to just catch me up. This is more or less the main problem with the film, that the story is not that great but generally this is covered by the solid chuckles that it produced for the majority.The cast are a major part of this success and the film benefits from two good turns from the leads. Caine is perfectly suited to the role and does the comic aspect very well. Martin seems to be working harder which is funny considering how much like his other work this character is. He mugs frantically but it works because it is a fine piece of "odd-couple" comedy that works by contrast. Headley is enjoyable even if she is never on the same level as the stars. Support from Rogers and McDiarmid is solid and they both add to the film in the detail.Overall this is an enjoyable and light film that maybe doesn't catch fire that often but did generally make me chuckle along with its individual scenes. The cast are all good and the story conveniently doesn't get in the way that often, producing a slick if unsophisticated film that will please many viewers by doing what it does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steve Marten is funny, period. Michael Caine has never enamored me until I saw him in miss congeniality. That was the first movie I really enjoyed him in. I recently bought DRS because I like Steve Martin and as far as humor goes Caine can't hold a candle to him. In this movie all he is is a set up man. A darn good set up man. Marten delivers ninety percent of the humor in this film. That said they were both great in their own roles. The only reason I can't give this a ten star rating is because I have no desire to rewind it and play it again. I still have only seen it once. Not to say this is not a good movie, because it is. There are only about four scenes that are really, really funny. SEE it, you will like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The two gentlemen's Martin and Caine does a grate performances in this wonderful comedy. It's a mystery that Caine and Martin never has done a film together - well, except for this one. This is actually a remake of a classic movie, with the same title, from the sixties. Back then, Marlon Brando played the part of Freddy Benson, but Steve Martin is more suited for role. This is the one of the few remakes how actually beats the original. For the first time that we see Steve Martin, entering the dining area of the train, we realise that this is going to be a entertaining movie. `DRS' might be a little silly, but the plot, the music, the cast and the direction by Frank Oz is all wonderful. The screenwriters should also have a big thank for all the movies well written scenes. My favourite is that scene when `the dirty rotten scoundrels' meets for the first time (`I couldn't help overhearing about?' `I'm afraid that's a little out of my class.') Michael Caine is perfect as Lawrence Jamieson. The intrigue really starts when they two make a bet. Anyway, later they change the bet (`A completely new bet!' `We make her the bet!'). One excellent part of the plot is that Lawrence thinks that Freddy is the mysterious `The Jackal'. The plot turns out in many unexpected ways, which is quit stimulating. Every minuet of this film give us something laughable. Dirty Rotten Scoundrels remains a timeless classic comedy, with unforgivable performances by Steve Martin and Michael Caine.</fullReview>

In 80's comedies, you often get great humor, such as Plains, Trains, and Automobiles, The Great Outdoors, and Police Academy Series, but rarely do you get a great storyline to go along with it. Dirty Rotten Scoundrels has a storyline that could rival movies of today's standards. This movie is up there in my top ten of all time and I highly recommend it. Flawless movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMDb mark: 9Is this movie a comedy? I wouldn't say so. Is it funny? It depends on your sense of humour. Is it good? Yes, absolutely. 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' isn't the type of movie that makes a person laugh from beginning to end. But, in my opinion, it is a great movie to watch whenever you want to relax. It's a 'feel-good' film.-Plot: One big-time crook and one small-time crook, both of them experts in scamming women, meet paths and then do everything possible to make some profit off of their encounter on the French Riviera. 25/25-Cast: There's no doubt that 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' owes a lot of its charm to the two great actors portraying the main characters, namely Michael Caine and Steve Martin. The supporting cast do a good job, too. 15/17-Ending: The ending is very good. Perhaps a bit too pushed to the extreme, but excellent nonetheless. Of course, taste varies. 14/15-Comedy: It's not humour that jumps at you. One needs to like and understand more sophisticated humour to get chuckles out of it. But it's fine as it is; otherwise, the movie would have been a classic comedy. 12/14-Acting: Steve Martin and Michael Caine are excellent. Glenne Headly isn't bad, either. She and Mr. Caine even put their abilities to fake accents of foreign people to good use here. 11/11-Shock Value: Not bad. A few surprises pop up here and there, and quite a few twists at the end hold the audience guessing. 7/8-Nudity: There is no nudity in this film. 0/6-Genre: This is an adventure film. 2/4--&gt;Overall: 86/100I'm afraid the title was meant to reveal something that isn't really there. I didn't find these guys to be dirty and rotten. Or maybe that's because I would be on their side. From Swordlord, 4 swords up!</fullReview>

All the jokes and funny moments are so "logical" for these characters that one gets amazed at their con-artist creativity! You have to see Michael Caine take money from rich ("...but never from virtuous" as he says) to help his "occupied country". The funny moments are never forced, and are so full of detail that one is challenged to catch it all on first viewing.Even if you are not too crazy about comedies, you'll love this film for it's setting at the south of France, acting performances, great story and a healthy dose of twists and turns.</fullReview>

While Caine's character manages to present himself as an up scaled, wealthy man in every role he takes on, somehow Martin's character ends up on the low end of character roles, making this movie even funnier. Michael Caine is perfect as a wealthy upper class gentleman, while Steve Martin plays the odd characters to the hilt! Janet Colgate completely makes you believe she is the innocent American girl next door. The ending is a hoot - and the movie is a real treat for ages teenage to 100!

		<fullReview>Smart, superior, and stylish are but a few warranted adjectives for "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels." Although I can always get a laugh out of movies like "Tommy Boy", "Dumb and Dumber", and "Dude Where's my Car?", they'll never hold my respect. Anybody can play variations of the same character in every movie (Jim Carrey, Chris Farley), and comedy is more than being sarcastic, contorting one's face in the weirdest imaginable ways, and going into random fits of rage all the time. Classy comedy just sticks longer in a person's mind. Movies like "Scoundrels" never get old. Even the plot of the movie is intelligent. And not merely descent, but rather ingenius. Only the most analytical of movies viewers could have picked the ending of this movie. In short, "Scoundrels" is in my mind one of the classiest, most intelligent, and funniest comedies of all time. Long live Martin and Caine!</fullReview>

"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" is a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always liked this show, but I just viewed it again and I was struck by how well written, well photographed, and well directed it is. Of course, Steve Martin and Michael Caine are exceptional actors who make the film work to a very large degree. The rest of the cast is so well composed and plays to the context in such a way that the film is entirely believable. Frank Oz has succeeded here much better, I feel, than in most of his other films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderful movie that takes the viewer to a world most of us will never see. It combines beautiful glowing photography with excellent acting. Pop in "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" and escape your troubles.Michael Caine is to be congratulated for aging gracefully...no plastic surgery or artifice. Here he is a slicked down upper class con man, full of pretense and rationalization. In his Riviera villa-web, he's a spider snagging philanthropic prey. Though this faux-king spends his easy-earned money on saving gardens and statues, one senses the underlying conceit is just the thrill of the game.Steve Martin's character- Freddy Benson- is more honest. He claims no noble purpose, and justifies defrauding women by stating, "We're the weaker ones! We get more heart attacks!". Martin is the finest physical comedian in films. His scenes imitating the suave Caine are perfect, as is Caine's far more subtle reaction to the antics.Glenne Headly overdoes the innocence, but Martin and Caine are tough acts to match. It is their movie, and Headly plays to that. For a great time, gather a couple of friends and watch "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"...or better still, enjoy it alone so you can rewind the great scenes. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple, straight forward, exactly what it presents itself as</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You may think from the title of my review that I didn't enjoy this movie. That couldn't be further from the truth. I thought Dirty Rotten Scoundrels was perfectly fun! I love Steve Martin, especially old school Steve Martin and this was the type of film that he was the King of in the eighties. This is absolutely made for him and showcases his awkward, quirky character comedy like fans of his look for. The only issue with the film (and maybe its not an issue at all) is that it is a by the book con-man comedy. You can read the back of the movie, look at the cover, and you know exactly what you're in for right down to the T. There are no surprises. Although the film has a fairly big twist in the end, I actually figured it out before the reveal and its a fun twist and absolutely made me smile but the film plants itself firmly in a neat little genre box and doesn't ever try to go outside of that for any reason. For fans of this genre or either Martin or Caine then you will absolutely love this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it! I just didn't get anything extraordinary out of it either. It was decent and I would watch it again. The gags are well placed and almost entirely in conjunction with the con angle.Steve Martin is absolutely perfectly Steve Martin in this. I love Martin, he is one of my favourite SNL/80's slapstick comedians and this is what he was born to do. We saw it in Roxanne, The Jerk, Mixed Nuts, My Blue Heaven and so on. His performance as the slimy, moronic Freddy is perfect for the film. You hate him, you love him, you laugh at him. Pure Martin! Michael Caine is perfectly cast as Martin's adversary at conning. He is suave and sophisticated and has more heart than Martin's character but he also sort of plays a back seat to Martin as well. Even the scenes of them together I feel like Caine isn't quite matching the comedic timing or exuberance of Martin which is understandable. Still Caine is good to be Martin's Yang to his Ying. Glenne Headly is also perfectly cast as the naive young target of Martin and Caine. Headly is quirky and fun and sort of irritating in a syrupy cute sort of way. She is the glue that holds the story and cast together and her and Martin are terrific together and easily have the best scenes.Its actually a very small cast, yes there are a host of small bit players but this film lives and breathes its main cast. They have the spotlight firmly placed on Steve Martin and that's where we want it. A legend in the film making business Frank Oz does directing duty and it definitely showcases his style. He has always been a terrific story teller and gets way more out of a script than what it presents. I mean, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels could have been completely forgettable if not for Martin and I think Frank Oz getting the most out of it. I must admit that I sort of expected a little more physical comedy and stunts but regardless its a fast paced, witty little story that will keep you watching and keep you laughing. Its an 80's classic for a reason. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With having recently found out that a friends favourite film genre is Comedy,I decided to try and find a title,that she could hopefully watch with her family over the Christmas period.Struggleing to find any comedies which contained the comedic style that I was searching for,I suddenly remembered,seeing a recent review by a fellow IMDb'er for a title that sounded like the exact type of movie that I was looking for.Taking a look at the IMDber's reviews page,I was delighted to find that the film sounded as dirty,rotten and scandalous as I was hoping it to be.The plot:Heading home on a plane to Beaumont-sur-Mer after stealing a necklace from an heiress.by convincing her that he needed cash to save a village from Communism,con artist Lawrence Jamieson's relaxing flight is interrupted,when he notices a man conning a woman out of a meal.Moving down the plane,Jamieson's hopes of an easy flight,are left in tatters when the dining con artiest takes a seat next to him.Introducing himself as Freedy Benson,Benson tells Lawrence that he is travelling to Beaumont-sur-Mer,due to hearing that there are a high number of wealthy individual's living in the area,who he hopes will be very easy to con.Desperate to be the only con artist in the city,Jamieson contacts his close friend,and Beaumont's police chief officer Andre,who arranges for Freedy to miss his drop-off point.Delighted over having the necklace in his hands and also having out witted a wannabe con artiest,Lawrence's celebrations are cut short,when Benson knocks on Jamieson's door,and gives him the good news that he has ran into someone who has been conned by Jamieson.Reliseing that he is stuck in a corner,Lawrence caves in to Freedy's demands,and begins training him,so that Benson can become the most sophisticated con- artiest.Being desperate to show that he is now the ultimate con artiest,Benson gets Jamieson to agree to a daring challenge,where one of them must con an heiress out of $50,000,in order that either Freedy or Lawrence can be declared the king of Beaumont-sur-Mer.View on the film:Featuring in almost every scene together,Steve Martin and Michael Cain give superb performances that compliment their contrasting comedic styles.Shown to be living the high life,Caine gives Jamieson a strong dose of dry wit,whose texture deepens as he finds himself at risk of being out manoeuvred by a fellow con.Perfectly complimenting Caine's sharp performance,Steve Martin gives a wonderfully brash performance,which despite occasionally going into an outrageous direction, (with one of the movies highlights being Martin pretending that he is a war vet) is kept balanced by Martin showing Benson's wild &amp; wicked con tricks to be the flip side of Jamieson's silky smooth cons.Joining the boys,Glenne Headly gives a great performance as the "air head" heiress who Benson and Jamieson are battling over,with Headly showing Janet Colgate to be far more quick witted than either of the guys can ever guess.Along with Headly,the film also features a terrific performance from Anton Rodgers, (known in the UK for his lead role in the sitcom May To December,and for also narrating the children's TV show Old Bear Stories)less than by the book cop Andre.Breaking away from the "90 minute" rule of Comedy movies for their adaptation of the 1964 movie Bedtime Story,the screenplay by Paul Henning and Stanley Shapiro keeps the film's plot moving at an extremely swift pace,with Henning and Shapiro showing Benson and Lawrence to use increasingly desperate measures,as the con reaches the finish line.For the excellent comedy in the movie,the writers smartly decide to keep it rooted in Freedy and Jamieson's "game" ,which along with letting the comedic elements to gradually take a delightfully crazy direction,also allows Henning and Shapiro to show how dirty,rotten and scandalous Benson and Jamieson really are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Oz directed this clever comedy that stars Steve Martin &amp; Michael Caine as two con artists on the French Mediterranean Coast who continuously bump into each other, interfering with each others plans. They then decide to settle things by making a bet: the first one to make a successful con on tourist Janet Colgate(played by Glenne Headly) will be the winner, and the loser will leave the country. They still team up to fool her with various disguises and schemes, but not everything is as it seems, leading to a memorable twist ending. Both Martin and Caine give funny performances, and work well together. Viewer may be uneasy rooting for these crooks, but it all works out well in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is directed by Frank Oz and written by Dan Launer, Stanley Shapiro and Paul Henning. It stars Michael Caine, Steve Martin, Glenne Headly and Anton Rogers. Music is by Miles Goodman and cinematography by Michael Ballhaus.Two con-men from different ends of the spectrum, prey on women's good nature to fund their lifestyles. Both operating out of the same Mediterranean town, they agree that the town simply isn't big enough for the both of them. They strike a bet where the first one to get fifty thousand out of the chosen female target, gets to stay in town while the other has to leave.A loose remake of Bedtime Story (1964) that starred David Niven and Marlon Brando, Frank Oz's picture is deliciously amoral, sly, clever and very funny. Boosted by the casting of Caine (oily slick) and Martin (live wire bottom feeder), who are both having a wonderful time of it, the film unfolds in a whirl of bluffs, chaos conning and oneupmanship. The story is slight for sure, but as the comedy set-pieces come and go, the ribs are tickled and the surprises that the makers have in store for us late in the day, are truly inspired. The French Mediterranean makes for a visually pleasing backdrop, while Goodman's score is consistently upbeat and perfect for such mirthful shenanigans.They are dirty, they are rotten and they are definitely scoundrels, but once your belly has subsided form the laughter, you may find yourself wondering just how the makers got you to cheer on such shifty characters?! The answer? Inspired casting and smooth construction of plotting by the director. Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, a real joy. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darned clever comedy with standout performances; a true gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film back in 1988 when it was released, and now -- an unbelievable 25 years later -- remembered it as being very good. I forgot just how good. This is a wonderful comedy, highlighted by top notch performances by leading cast members.Steve Martin is at his best here, funnily sleazy; this may be his best comedy, and that's saying a lot. I wouldn't go so far as to say that this is Michael Caine's best film role; after all there have been gems such as "The Cider House Rules" and "The Man Who Would Be King"; but this is certainly his best comedy role...perhaps because he plays it as a straight dramatic role. I guess I've never paid much attention to Glenne Headly, who hear plays the third scoundrel, but she is fantastic.This is one of those films that, for the most part, isn't difficult to figure out. I thought it was pretty obvious that Headly was another scoundrel out to scam the scammers. But a comedy doesn't have to be difficult to figure out to be good, because it's more about the humor in the journey than it is about revolving around secrets. And this journey is darned funny.Top it all off with lush setting and fine cinematography, and this movie hits the sweet spot. Highly recommended to just revel in the performances in a solid story and great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A whipping good laugh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sensational remake of "Bedtime Story" (1964 starring David Niven and Marlon Brando) with Caine as the dapper, refined con artist living in the lap of luxury on the Med whose chance encounter with Martin's philistine grifter gives way to a reluctant partnership whereby the two swindle a succession of wealthy suckers until they meet their match.Full of hilarious slapstick and one-liners where the two attempt to out-wit the other in the begrudging relationship that forms out of necessity. Glenne Headly more than holds her own in her first starring role as the apparently naive heiress, played off by Caine and Martin in a bid to win her fortune. Barbara Harris has a small but pivotal supporting role as an early 'victim', and Anton Rodgers and Ian McDairmid add their subtle touches as Caine's faithful fixers.The soundtrack is reminiscent of the TV show "Fresh Fields" around at the time, and the Mediterranean locations are colourful backdrops to a superb comedy that while, not an original, is an accomplished re-imagination from comedic genius Frank Oz.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My second favorite Steve Martin comedy... but Caine steals the show!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great comedy! It started out a bit slow but when Glenne Headly came along and Steve Martin and Michael Caine placed their bets on whoever scams her gets to stay on the Riviera that's when the film really shifted into high gear for me! Seeing Steve in the wheelchair while Michael takes extreme delight in wooing Glenne was a riot! Caine sporting a German accent (playing Dr. Shauffhausen) and whipping the crap out of poor Martin's legs with a switch had me in stitches! I honestly didn't know that Caine was so good with comedy. And his German (and later Australian) accents were perfect! Martin was great with the physical comedy (as always) but Caine really stole the show with his sophisticated and cunning demeanor.The film was also photographed beautifully by cinematographer Michael Ballhaus (who shot AIR FORCE ONE and a bunch of Scorcese films) and the French Riviera is just an extra added bonus. Especially for an avid Bond lover like myself. I just love that whole elegant vibe of the South of France. Casinos, warm weather, palm trees, beaches, expensive villas, luxury yachts. Great stuff! The twist ending totally took me by surprise. Definitely did not see it coming. I won't even talk about it. Brilliant twist!! I even listened to the Frank Oz commentary. I really appreciated that he basically made this film as an homage to those classic 50s/60s caper films. You typically don't associate Steve Martin with those types of films. But with the elegance of the French Riviera and the debonair Michael Caine on hand it totally works! Highly recommended. My second favorite Martin film after the classic PLANES, TRAINS, AND AUTOMOBILES.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A traditional but still funny comic caper - 76%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, it's difficult to disassociate the name of Frank Oz with arguably his most famous role, the vertically-challenged Jedi master Yoda. Despite a career directing movies since the early Eighties, Oz will forever conjure up images for me of the wizened green whatever-it-is sitting in a director's chair screaming "Action, you will!". Fortunately, it would appear as though the Force is strong with this which feels like an old-fashioned screwball comedy but played for as many laughs as possible.Lawrence Jamieson (Michael Caine) has carved himself a lucrative lifestyle on the French Riveria, conning the rich and the gullible of their cash along with the help of local policeman Andre (Anton Rodgers) and Lawrence's faithful butler Arthur (Darth Sidious himself Ian McDiarmid). But when brash American huckster Freddy Benson (Steve Martin) comes to town, Lawrence senses a threat and tries every trick in the book to get rid of him. Clearly, only one can operate on this particular patch so they devise a bet - the first to scam $50'000 from the beautiful Janet Colgate (Glenn Headly) stays while the other leaves town for good. And so the con is on...The plot might seem a little old-fashioned but "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" remains a solidly entertaining comedy that has a decent enough story at its heart to keep you interested. Caine isn't the strongest comic actor but channelling David Niven is pretty much all that required of the role and he does this perfectly. Martin is also on top form, being much more animated than I remember and is just brilliant in some scenes - the point where he is pretending to be a paraplegic while Caine batters his legs with a cane to "test" his nerves is simply hilarious! Headly does a fine job too of being blonde enough to appear vulnerable but stubborn enough to resist their ill-placed charm. My only real concern is the ending which, whilst performed as well as the rest of the film, is signposted fairly early on and doesn't really surprise as well as it should.Although it looks and feels much older than it is, "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" is still a highly enjoyable comedy caper. It looks pretty, as you'd expect on the Riveria, and Martin and Caine make a decent double act. The script has plenty of comic moments to savour and although the ending isn't disguised enough, it still provides a wonderfully fitting climax to proceedings. Assuming you're not put off by the thought of Yoda being behind the camera, you'd do well to track down this genteel but bitingly funny film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Highly amusing and very pretty to look at comedy with Caine and Martin vying for the undisputed "King Con" rights to a Mediterranean resort peopled by a seemingly never-ending stream of filthy-rich and extremely gullible American women just desperate to give away their money and more to the first silver-tongued devil they encounter.Beautifully shot in the scenic Italan Riviera, the script is a gift for Mchael Caine as the reigning number one upper-class smooth operator whose dominion is challenged by young punk Steve Martin's new kid on the block. Initially mentor and protégé, during which sequence Martin gets to tribute the Three Stooges, Harpo Marx and Jerry Lewis, they naturally later fall out and become rivals in a competition to dupe a supposedly warm-hearted but dim American heiress, well played by Glenne Headly.Plenty of laughs ensue, particularly when Martin adopts a crippled war veteran disguise with an aversion to dancing (cue reprise of "The Jerk's" "Happy Feet" scene) with Caine effortlessly playing the straight man to good effect. Occasionally Martin, as is his wont, overdoes the improv and anyway how come he's billed above Caine in the titles but apart from a predictable-from-twenty-miles-out twist at the end, this was for me a bright, likable comedy directed with élan by Frank Oz.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Delightful Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The comedy film Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is directed by Frank Oz and stars Steve Martin and Michael Caine. The film takes place in the modern day French Riviera.The films starts off with a French man, Lawrence Jamieson (Caine), performing a con on a young, rich woman. He sits next to the woman in a casino and they play roulette together, Lawrence bets on all the same numbers as the woman. When he loses all his money he tells his associate that he would like to sell his ring for some more money, and to that his associate replies that he can't sell the royal ring. So Lawrence leaves the table and the woman follows. Lawrence tells her that he in facts is a Prince and is trying to raise money to help save the people of his country. She eventually gives him a large sum of money to help out the cause. Then Lawrence goes on a train and watches how Freddy Benson cons a woman into buying him a meal by saying how he is saving money to help his grandmother. After a series of events Freddy takes lessons from Lawrence even though Lawrence is secretly trying to get him to leave the area because he does not want Freddy to ruin the con hunt for him. Then these two dirty rotten scoundrels make a bet to see who is the better con artist...The screenplay for this film was really quite witty and clever. It was entertaining the whole way through and the characters were very evenly balanced. By that I mean that there really was not one character I favored the whole way through until really the end I chose a side. The jokes were solid and I thought the absolute ending was brilliant. I thought part of the end was predictable but then it just took that and brought it to a new level. A very delightful screenplay and it was converted delightfully to the screen.The direction for this film by Frank Oz was also quite good. He got great comedic performances from his leads and also kept a film that could have easily been drawn out and boring entertaining. There was really no complex shots in this film but none were really required because it was not trying to be an epic film or something of that sort. What made the direction truly great, and all great comedies great is the reaction shots. They were all perfectly timed and just so effective. Oz proved that he is a comedic force to be reckoned with.The acting in this film was hilarious, enjoyable, and so easy to get sucked into. Caine was great as Lawrence Jamieson using several different accents brilliantly and making it so easy to like him as a person even though he makes a living out of stealing other people's money. He is the cultured French man who also loves the art of the con. Steve Martin was also wonderful as Freddy Benson who was the amateur con artist that only had really one trick up his sleeve but had to compete in the big league against Lawrence. He provided most of the great reaction shots and to tell you the truth I forgot that both of the two were acting and just got sucked into the film.Overall I give this film a solid 8/10. I would recommend this to anyone who loves a smart, entertaining comedy.</fullReview>

Steve Martin is at his best too - very funny physically as always and makes the most of his role to make the audience laugh. His Ruprecht is a really hilarious character. The supporting cast do a good job too - Barbara Harris and Anton Rodgers acquit themselves admirably. I don't remember seeing the original movie with Niven and Brando though I may have done when I was a kid- but I cannot imagine them as the characters that Caine and Martin play. The movie is fairly slow to start but gathers pace as it progresses so stick with it. The location is superb and the whole atmosphere of the movie works really well.

		<fullReview>How about that... I never knew that Dirty Rotten Scoundrels was a remake. I enjoyed the remake but was always, ALWAYS disappointed that Steve Martin was supposed to be the 'younger' guy...what a joke.Now, seeing the original i realize my instinct was right on.Casting Michael Caine for David Niven was a good choice... Casting Steve Martin for Marlon Brando??!? While Steve Martin did a good enough job, i can only imagine how much more interesting/funny it would be with someone else doing Freddy. When Steve Martin says towards the middle of the film that he's younger than Michael Caine, all i could think was...by 2 years?! Something that i almost NEVER do, is like the remake as much as the original. In this case, i almost like both equally. The original is still slightly better, mostly because of the quality of actors. The original ending is slightly better as well. While i like the ending of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, the ending in the original is much more satisfying... :D Now, if only i could own both on a high quality DVD/BluRay in Widescreen...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This crime comedy, released when I was only two years old, didn't catch my attention until VERY recently, around the time I watched "Bowfinger" for the first time in years this month. That film was directed by Frank Oz and features Steve Martin as one of the two co-stars, just like this one. That was how I discovered "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels", a remake of a 1964 film called "Bedtime Story", which I've never seen. In fact, I watched this 1988 film not knowing it was based on any picture that was made before it. I was expecting this movie to be at least slightly better than "Bowfinger", even though that 1999 comedy is pretty funny, but my expectations may have been a little too high. For a while, I was getting disappointed, but fortunately, this didn't last.Freddy Benson and Lawrence Jamieson are two con artists who make a living out of swindling rich women. After a successful operation, Lawrence is on a train on his way back to Beaumont-sur-Mer, France, where he currently resides. It is during this train ride when he first meets Freddy, after watching him bilking a woman by making up a story about having a very sick grandmother. Freddy happens to be on his way to Beaumont-sur-Mer, and Lawrence thinks he might have competition if the two of them are in the same town together, so at the station, he tricks Freddy into staying on the train. However, it isn't long at all before Lawrence sees his rival in town again, and Freddy soon learns that the two of them have the same profession. He gets Lawrence to agree to teach him his conning skills by threatening to expose him if he doesn't. Their rivalry continues to the point where they make a bet. They will see which one of them will be to first to cheat a certain woman out of $50,000, and the loser will leave town.Freddy is the character Steve Martin plays, and Lawrence is played by Michael Caine. Lawrence is the first of the two leads to appear in the film. The beginning, showing this character just before he meets the other con artist, is not hilarious but sometimes mildly amusing, and Caine already shows his acting talent. Freddy then makes his first appearance on the train, and the first really funny part is here, with the character telling the story of his sick grandmother and then making a massive order of food which his victim has promised to pay for. After this, the movie is not always that funny, but often is, especially with the antics of Martin, in scenes such as the jail cell one, in which his character struggles to try and remember Lawrence's name. I didn't care much for the scene showing Lawrence talking to one of his victims before he introduces her to Freddy posing as Ruprecht, though I did find the part where Freddy's mentally challenged alter ego is introduced funny, even if some are bound to find it offensive. There also might be a lot of subtle humour which I didn't get. Still, there are lots of funny parts, and it gets better later on, with Freddy posing as a traumatized soldier and Lawrence posing as a psychiatrist. At this point, it gets funnier and also a bit more exciting.I already mentioned that I haven't seen "Bedtime Story", the 1964 comedy starring Marlon Brando and David Niven, which this 1988 film is based on. Even though remakes are often inferior to originals, I obviously don't know how these two in particular compare, but I guess I'm not the only one who has seen "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" but not "Bedtime Story", since this film seems to be more widely recognized today. I'm sure I will see the original someday, but in the meantime, I will say that overall, this remake is a funny crime comedy, and the two leads actors, Steve Martin and Michael Caine, are both very impressive in their roles, even if Martin is the one who provides most of the humour. The supporting cast is mostly good as well. A lot of people probably like this movie better than "Bowfinger", and I can't say I'm one of them, but I would say both of them are pretty funny and worth watching if you're a fan of the co-stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I came across this film by chance, whilst looking for a copy of Bedtime Story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the review, by Bill Slocum, and bought the DVD. What a let-down. Michael Caine has been constantly miscast by Hollywood, and to expect him to reprise the role that David Niven made so memorable, was doomed from the outset. They did the same with Joan Collins. Caine does best playing London, East-End Jewish barrow-boys - Alfie and Mona Lisa are good examples. To cast him as an English gentleman is farcical. But he is on the Hollywood social "A" List, according to himself; he has a good tailor and he plays by their rules. Steve Martin can be funny, but he is no Marlon Brando. For those who want to capture the essence of this story, nail down a copy of "Bedtime Story" - for a believable portrait of an English aristocrat and a stylish confidence trickster and that of an American chancer. Another gem of David Niven's was "The Best of Enemies" with Alberto Sordi as the Italian Commandant of a POW camp in Abyssinia in WWII. A Nice contrast of styles; the gentlemanly good manners and humour of Niven and the exasperation of Sordi. Unfortunately, it is not available on DVD; like Hot Millions; Laughter in Paradise; Toi le Venin; Becket;The Switchboard Operator and so many other gems of the 1950's, consigned to the vaults.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun on the French Riviera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love films about con-men, and even though this one features a plot that is about as believable as a flock of flying pigs; there's a lot of fun to be had with it. Dirty Rotten Scoundrels benefits from the duo of Michael Caine and Steve Martin, who star as a couple of con-men working on the French Riviera. However, the town of Beaumont Du Mer isn't big enough for the both of them, and so the pair has a little wager; and the loser has to leave! Dirty Rotten Scoundrels works largely because of its lead stars. Caine and Martin have proved themselves successful individually, and their combined chemistry here is really fun to watch. Both actors have very different styles of comedy, which allows them to play off one another well. The French Riviera provides a nice setting for a film like this to take place, and director Frank 'Yoda' Oz delights in capturing all the glamour, which helps to give the film a real sense of style. The plot itself is well worked, and although Steve Martin can go over the top at times with his brash brand of comedy; the film does get more interesting as the plot thickens and the final twists at the end are well implemented. Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is a film that is real fun to view, and I don't hesitate to recommend it to anyone that enjoys fun films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb comedy, one of my all time favorites.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmed in Nice, France, this story is set in the fictitious resort city of Beaumont sur Mer, which probably means "beautiful mountains along the sea." And they really are. Michael Caine and Steve Martin play two "con" men who prey on rich American women, and are very successful. So successful that Caine's character owns a mansion, with servants, loads of money, with a back yard that opens onto the Mediterranian sea. Martin's character is envious, and wants it all. However, "Beaumont" is not big enough for both of them. After Caine teaches Martin all he knows about being a suave gentleman (Martin's only finished high school and majored in metal shop), and asks him to leave town, Martin refuses, "A guy with a big mouth like mine could do you lots of damage around here", he says to Caine.So, they set up a winner-take-all contest, and the loser agrees to leave town and never return. The winner is the first one to swindle $50,000 from a suitable prey. Then "Janet Colgate", the "American Soap Queen" shows up. Naturally, they think she is heir to the "Colgate" fortune so off they go.The writing and acting are just masterful. Every time you think one man has the upper hand, a totally unexpected twist gives it to the other, then back again later. The scenes where Martin plays Caine's strange brother "Rupreckt" are sheer comedic genius. Also, lots of belly laughs where Caine, playing a German doctor, uses a reed across Martin's "paralyzed" legs, with increasing vigor, to see if he indeed has no feeling at all! And the scene where Martin finally "walks" into the bedroom is marvelous. Jim Carrey nowadays gets most credit for his "physical comedy", but in my book no one does it as well as Steve Martin, even Jim Carrey.SPOILERS FOLLOW. When it comes to light that "Ms Janet Colgate" is not a rich heir, and only a contest winner in France on an all-expenses paid vacation, they feel sorry for her. After all, they only take advantage of rich women. So they change the contest to "whoever gets her in bed first." Right when you think one of the two con men will succeed, the advantage switches. In the end, "Janet" steals Martin's clothes and money while he is in the shower, sobs to Caine about her "misfortune", getting him to give her money, and she flies away. Just as Martin shows up in a bathrobe. Turns out the briefcase in Caine's hand doesn't have the $50,000 that he thought "Janet" returned, instead it had martin's clothes. As the plane disappears, and Martin is saying what a disgusting scoundrel "Janet" is, Caine starts smiling, saying what a "marvelous scoundrel" she is.A year later, the two of them are sitting on a bench, looking out over the sea, and a group of rich tourists clamor up the hill towards them, led by "Janet" in a new guise. This time for investment in Australian real estate. After the brief "pitch", and the tourists head towards Caine's mansion, she lingers to tell the two men, "You know, I made over $3million last year, but your $50,000 was the most fun!" A wonderful, inspired comedy, just perfectly written, directed, and acted. "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" is one that I watch over and over, as opportunities arise.</fullReview>

As in all great comedies, his foil is equally talented - the incomparable Steve Martin, in an unforgettable role as a small time American con artist. Martin's physical comedy is the perfect match for Caine's impeccable style and delivery. This is a movie filled with memorable scenes and unforgettable lines.The plot moves quickly through the simultaneous cooperation and competition between the two crooks, and their seems to be no limit to their pranks. The chemistry between the two actors is more than convincing, it is electric - it produces an atmosphere of intelligent, witty humor reminiscent of the earlier comedies to which it pays tribute; however, there is nothing innocent or naive about this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, villains are usually the best characters in movies. They provide a refreshing change from the whiter-than-white heroes, often to the point that they become more intriguing than the main character (like Dr. Evil in the Austin Powers movies). This film focuses solely on the villains - a pair of con artists. Lawrence Jamieson (played by Caine) is an established trickster in the town, pretending he is a freedom-fighting prince to gain money. When Freddy Benson (Steve Martin)arrives, Lawrence's business in the town is threatened. He proposes a bet between them to be the first to obtain $50,000 from a particular woman, and the loser has to leave town. Whilst the plot isn't the best or most meaningful ever, the script is sharp and funny. The audience is repeatedly tricked into the bluffs and double-bluffs pulled by the characters on each other, resulting in a surprise but interesting ending. Fun all the way through, Michael Caine and Steve Martin make hilarious rivals, superbly directed by Frank Oz (perhaps better known as the voice of Yoda and some of the Muppets - but don't let that put you off!) Rent it, buy it, or watch it on TV - you must see this movie!</fullReview>

Steve Martin is such a funny actor and he gets to play a zany American type in his own way really well. Michael Caine is a hugely versatile actor and one of my favorites, and he's a sort of restrained cad in a fun way. But they don't really make any magic happen together, and the plot, which depends on being clever and full of twists, isn't all that clever or twisty.Yes it's fun. It's enjoyable.

		<fullReview>This is a very pleasant and amiable comedy, though it's not one that provides so many laughs that you'll roll on the floor or push your friends to watch it with you. But this isn't a bad thing, as the movie still is quite watchable and quite approachable to those who are not huge fans of Steve Martin's brand of humor. While not nearly as crazy as his older films (such as THE MAN WITH TWO BRAINS or THE JERK), it is thankfully not as conventional, low energy and dull as CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN or some of his other recent films.This comedy is also different because in addition to Martin, Michael Caine is also in the lead. They both play swindlers--one sophisticated and cool (Caine) and the other a bit vulgar but perhaps equally effective (Martin). At first, they battle each other trying to prove they are the better grifter of the two, but then later they decide to join forces. It is at these moments as a team that the film provides the most laughs--particularly when Steve Martin really hams it up in order to scare away ladies who expect Caine to marry them. In other words, Caine used the women and got money from them and then Martin's awful behaviors as Caine's "brother" was used to get the women to run away in terror. These moments, plus the surprise ending make for a very entertaining if slight film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Chemistry make these Scoundrels, and this Movie, Very Likable,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and a talented comedic cast. It is certainly intriguing as we follow two con men, Lawrence and Freddy, as they pull off some of their best work yet. It was a risky project for whimsical director Frank Oz as we are required to like two characters who are not even being themselves, but an entirely different character altogether, for the majority of the film. As they try to trick a woman in to giving away her fortunes to them, thankfully, the sheer dedication of their work is exactly what ends up making them likable, their willingness not to give up. However, the fact that they are role playing for the majority of the film did make us unfamiliar with the two lead characters. We learn very little about Freddy and Lawrence, much more about their fake personas, which does make us feel disconnected from them on a personal level. The cast is top notch and the main reason this film is as good as it is. Steve Martin and Michael Caine make an entertaining duo, both being so different in many ways, which makes it so enjoyable to see them together. Caine adds class, while Martin brings in improv. Glenne Headly also proves strong enough as an actress to stand out with these two by her side, playing a surprisingly layered character. Well written, funny and engrossing, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is a great ride that should not be missed by fans of Caine, Martin or Oz, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy. Two con men make a wager over a glamorous heiress. Best Performance: Michael Caine</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" is a classic comedy, driven from beginning to end by the crafty characters created by Michael Caine and Steve Martin. The cinematography is fresh and the comedy is timeless. The story revolves around a simple American con-man (brilliantly played by Steve Martin) who specializes in charming wealthy women out of whatever charity he can manage to swindle. That is, until he stumbles on to the master (Michael Caine), a suave ultra-swank European who doesn't go for the fast buck, but rather for the slow millions. There are so many jokes crammed within the 106 minutes of this film, it really is a laugh from start to finish. The combination of Steve Martin, Michael Caine and Glenne Headly was an inspired choice with the humour moving from dry to slapstick and back again within the same scene.Finally, this movie has a lovely look to it, allowing you to take a fantasy trip to the French Riviera, stay in the finest hotels and villas, and sip the best champagne - that's a step up from most movies these days right there. No explosions or violence. Amazing!Overall rating: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gut-Bustingly Hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is the sordid tale of two confidence men who bump into each other on the French Riviera and place an exorbitant wager on a mark. The first, Lawrence Jamieson (Caine) fancies himself a bit of a dandy. He's carved an opulent lifestyle for himself on the shores of Beaumont-Sur- Mer and would like his sleepy little town to stay that way. The second con- artist, Freddy Benson (Martin) is an unctuous but ambitious trickster who came to town hoping to learn from Lawrence but has since had second thoughts. He's the type of guy you'd see at a dog track, hustling for a good $20 here and there. Their mark; a naive nymph named Janet (Headly) introduced to the two as America's Soap Queen.Written by Dale Launer and based on the TV movie Bedtime Story (1964), the film was originally meant to be a starring vehicle for the affable David Bowie and Mick Jagger of Rolling Stones fame. If you close your eyes and listen carefully you can hear Bowie's droll intonations underneath Caine's yachtsman inflections. This is not to say Caine is unsuited for the role. Quite the contrary; Caine's star power, silent dignity and "up-for-anything" attitude brings to mind an old-guard acting sensibility channeling Alec Guinness in his prime. Being the straight man to one "Wild and crazy guy" is hard enough but to do so with effortless class is a downright miracle which the great Michael Caine pulls off.The previous year's Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1987) saw Steve Martin transitioning from his goofy, ironically infused brand of comedy, to the sullen but lovable rube role he used to coast through the 90's. Improvising much of his lines and energetically bouncing off the walls, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is seen by many as his final hurrah. A ham at his most acclaimed, Martin falls into a caboodle of eccentric characterizations, Prince Ruprecht being the most entertaining. He's an absolute comic gem, a permanent fixture in the comedic firmament and this film is Exhibit A to all the naysayers who saw The Pink Panther (2006) and thought he's not all that.If Howard Hawks thought every great film is three great scenes and no bad ones, then Dirty Rotten Scoundrels certainly fits the bill. There are in fact three scenes so astoundingly funny that it'd be easy to miss some of the subtler gags hidden in the quieter moments. What's more, each scene (both good and great) are natural extensions of the characters and play with our assumptions of where the film will ultimately lead us. Leave it to director Frank Oz to find moments of glee in the sophisticated halls of a ritzy Casino or the marble mezzanine of a Mediterranean villa.Of course this film is not without it's faults including most egregiously an outdated attitude towards women. Glenne Headly certainly holds her own against our two leading cads, and sure she does sneak in her own counter- plays, but when Lawrence refers to women as "the weaker sex," you can't help but feel the screenplay means that. In one scene Martin poses with a gaggle of bikini-wearing models at the beach. It's rumored in the European release those same models were topless and when the women were ordered to undress Oz referred to himself feeling like "the most powerful man in the world."I wouldn't challenge anyone who dislikes this film for that reason, though, for me, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels has enough gut-busting laughs to overcome most of it's transgressions. Very few comedies deliver the goods as often and with such voracity as this film does. The film has since been turned into a live stage musical. While I cannot speak for it's quality I can say the casting of John Lithgow and Broadway legend Norbert Leo Butz should be enough to make you curious about the original winner.</fullReview>

Fun to watch for the nostalgia, the solid plot, and the performances (although, as usual, Steve Martin can be a bit too much at times). Nothing deep or profound here at all, just an entertaining way to pass nearly two hours. As other reviewers have mentioned, stick with it even if you are having your doubts, because the last 15 or so minutes really bring it home.

Whole scenes of action and reams of dialogue take on different meanings for the viewer as more is revealed to the viewer of what is really going on. While within the action, characters with different levels of insight into what's happening understand words and actions with different meanings.

I do not suffer the silly for silly's sake frat comedies well at all.. much less the high school and least of all the "Dumb &amp; Dumber" fare.And yet.. this is one of my all time favorite comedies. Is it quite silly on occasion? Indeed. Is it somehow brilliant above all others? Doubtful. Yet it is so 'brilliantly' absurd in it's timing.. while being quite sexy due it's lovely and charming femme fatale character too.. and ends up being almost shockingly hilarious.Add the locations of the scenes.. and the absolutely brilliant presence of Sir Michael Caine.. mix in just the tolerable amount of Steve Martin's zany factor.. and this film stands up against all comedies throughout the film eras experienced during my 'fitty-five' years far above almost all others seen! #Bravo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my all-time favourite comedies. LOL's are guaranteed! Clever script, top acting (Michael Caine and Steve Martin have great chemistry, making me wish they'd made more films together), smooth editing, and cute music.A special nod for the costuming (perhaps the brainchild of director Oz): I really love the way that they juxtapose the light-and-dark costuming for Caine and Martin, particularly accentuating their opposite-ness, in a delightfully harmonious way.I've seen this film over a dozen times, and it still makes me laugh. This is late-80's silly-comedy gold!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easy to Like Bit of Easy Going Fluff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may be one of the Least Funny Most Overrated Comedies Ever. That doesn't Necessarily mean that it isn't Amusing. it Occasionally is Humorous and on Rare Occasions it is Hilarious. But it is Inconsistent and Dull at Times and the Pacing is Laborious. It Seems to take Great Care with the Costumes and the Sets going for Luscious and Beautiful (in a comedy?). Well OK, but to what End. The Strengths of the Film are the Actors, Steve Martin and Michael Cain. Cain is Fine but Martin is for Some Reason, Painfully Restrained.Director Oz is Attempting Class and does Succeed with that (in a comedy?) and it is a Throwback to what used to be Called a Sophisticated Comedy. It Works Somewhat but the Film seems Out of Time, maybe even Dated. But Folks and Critics Love this Movie and it does have a Charming Innocence that was Rare at the Time and Now is Nonexistent.Inoffensive Bit of Fluff that Never Alienates or Distances the Viewer with Outrageousness or an Over the Top Reach. No it just sort of Lies There and Casually Asks You to Like it and many took the Bait. Steve Martin Fans may give the Comedian Kudos for Underplaying and Still Managing to be Steve Martin Funny. He and the Movie are Somewhat Successful, but Overall it isn't much, but has a Certain Easy Appeal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't waste your time hiding your funny bone, they'll find it. Michael Caine is aces in this movie and general in my opinion. Glenne Headly and Steve Martin, while seeming to be playing second fiddle the entire time, performed their motifs successfully, if I may say so.I was hesitant at first, knowing that Michael Caine and Steve Martin don't seem to line up on paper. I'm glad to say that this was a gross underestimation of both Mr. Martin and Caines acting chops on my part. During the scenes with Ruprecht I kept waiting for Martin to take it too far; I think it's safe to say, he never did. It's like Robert Downey Jr's character in Tropic Thunder implies, never go all the way.Adding to my list of favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite simply, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is one of the best comedies ever.It revolves around a bet between two competing scammers with different backgrounds, different methods, and different values. Steve Martin and Michael Caine are wonderful as the competitors who will stop at (almost) nothing to win. Both actors display perfect timing and Martin creates a character named Ruprecht who is a classic.The script is clever and hilarious. It contains numerous scenes that are pitch perfect, with small details that put this comedy in a class reserved for the best.In addition, the music is perfectly suited--featuring jazz violin stylings that might remind you of Stephane Grappelli--and the cinematography is lovely, having been filmed on the French Riviera.The plot has numerous twists, which any film about grifters should have. It keeps you guessing and laughing throughout. This is the film that answers the question: In the long con, how long is long enough?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lawrence Jamieson (Michael Caine) and Freddy Benson (Steve Martin) are both con men. Lawrence is the sophisticated established man conning rich old ladies of Beaumont Sur Mer on the Mediterranean coast. Freddy is the brash newcomer. When Lawrence couldn't trick Freddy to leave time after time, Freddy comes up with a bet where the loser leaves town. The object of the bet is to con $50,000 from Janet Colgate (Glenne Headly).The best thing about this movie is the chemistry between Michael Caine and Steve Martin. They fit together perfectly. Steve Martin does some hilarious bits. And you have to love them even though they are both unapologetic con men.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steve Martin and Michael Caine are a couple of con artist you can really like.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it, these two guys are a couple of dirty rotten scoundrels, but I could not help but like them. In fact I would have to say it is one of my favorite Steve Martin movies if not the number one film in my book. Which this is a bit of a strange occurrence as I usually do not care for comedies that last as long as this film did as this one nearly clocked in at two hours long. The gist of the film has a local con man in a small town in France I think conning woman after woman getting them to give him money and such. He lives in a very nice home and he is very well established in the area. Unfortunately, he hears that a very famous con man is coming to the area, known as the Jackal. Well he runs into Steve Martin's character and thinks he is in fact the Jackal and proceeds to try and get rid of him any way possible. Martin's character wants to stay in the area though as this town seems ripe with rich women willing to part with their money and give it to a guy who has a good con. At a certain point Caine's character seems to try to take Martin's character under his wings and teach him the techniques that he has learned over the years. This is just another way to get rid of Martin's character and very funny scenes ensue as Caine gets Martin to act like a very demented brother so he can get certain ladies to break up with him. The end has the two dueling to see who can stay in the area while the loser must leave they pick a lady whom they are supposed to con and get her money. A great scene involving Martin and a wheelchair and Caine posing as a doctor occurs during this stretch. It also ended very funny and unexpectedly for me. The movie on a whole was very funny and very well acted, maybe a couple of minutes of time taken off and such. Also, I was a bit disappointed as a kid when the movie did not feature the scene in the trailers where Martin's character pushed a lady into a river, but that may have made the con man a bit to dark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is a comedy with impeccably graceful pace, and inspired characters, made brilliant by the zany energy of Steve Martin playing against the suave craftiness of Michael Caine. Certain moments, especially the first visit to Ruprecht, and the examination technique of Dr Emil Schoffhausen, get me absolutely screaming with laughter every time I watch the film - in fact, every time I think about them! But the perfection of the cast - notably Anton Rogers's laconic police chief, Ian McDiarmid's long-suffering butler, and Barbara Harris's 'Lady Fanny of Omaha' - and the lighthearted beauty of the Mediterranean landscape, are added aspects of the film's perfection. It's a masterpiece of the genre, and you'll watch it with increasing pleasure for the rest of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is def. a classic comedy, full of twists and humor. Steve Martin and Michael Caine are brilliant, as is the lead female actress. I won't play into the plot that much, but it basically has to do with scamming and the people who do the scamming. The film is an original heist movie, it was just so good. The humor in it is somewhat typical, but it has a lot more darker humor in it to. All the actors make their characters so believable, and it is a must see for anyone who are fans of them. Movies like these are rare, the best example would be Oceans 11, and even that is a remake. This is a classic, and unfortunately can see this being remade by Hollywood, which would be a disaster.

He's got it all: sun, sand, sea connections with the police, plenty of rich and naive tourists and best of all, NO competition! Until small-time crook Freddy Benson shows up and begins stealing LAWRENCE'S women! No matter how hard Lawrence tries, Freddy just keeps coming back. Finally they both come to the conclusion that there isn't room for both of them and make a bet to see who can get 50,000 dollars from a woman armed with only their wits and charm. This woman is Miss Janet Colgate, the United States soap queen. The heat is on to see who can outcharm who and who'll get the ultimate prize. Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is one of those comedies that will never be forgotten. It's got wit, style, a few laugh out loud moments, an all-star cast and a pinch of romance. It's always a pleasure to watch Martin and Caine try to outwit each other in the game of "possesion." In fact stop reading this! Dash down to your nearest video shop and get it now! This is a comedy that'll make you smile shinier than the Mediterranean Sun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a remake of 60's comedy with Marlon Brando and David Niven. I haven't seen the original , so I don't have any comparison . I don't know is it better or worse . I'm sure that Michael Caine and Steve Martin are worthy successors . The movie however ? Hmmmmm? I don't know . I think it's overrated . I was expecting a lot more.The screenplay pretends to be clever , but it isn't . Most of the jokes are forced and I felt like the movie was wasting the talents of both Caine and Martin . Still , they both give solid performances despite the lack of true chemistry between them. The story itself doesn't have any twists that you could expect from a movie about con-artists . It also lacks heart , despite writers intentions to send some morality message.I was surprised by Glenne Headly as Janet Colgate . In some ways she steals the show from Caine and Martin . Her character is very natural , good , and delicate . She has some charm that makes her different from stereotypical naive woman."Dirty rotten scoundrels" tries to imitate the feel of 60's movie . In my opinion it's a fruitless attempt. It simply didn't felt like a 60's movie . It also doesn't feels like a 80's movie . "DRS" lacks soul.It's not a bad movie . It was quite pleasant ride for me . Unfortunately , aside from Ruprecht I wasn't laughing out loud . I was more like grinning from time to time . I think they could do more with this movie . I give it 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Given how great "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" is, it's surprising that Steve Martin and Michael Caine haven't collaborated a second time. They play con men Freddy Benson and Lawrence Jamieson, respectively, both vying for the heart of tourist Janet Colgate (Glenne Headly) in the French Riviera. But boy do they have a surprise coming! There's some great sequences here, namely the whole part where Steve Martin's in the wheelchair, and I sure didn't see that ending coming! All in all, not only do you die laughing here, you just might want to take a trip to southern France to see where they filmed this. Conning always makes for neat movie plots, but none like this. Also starring Ian McDiarmid (yes, the guy from "Star Wars" episodes 1-3) as Lawrence's butler.</fullReview>

My friends and I constantly regurgitate lines from this movie in everyday conversation: "I want this!", "Lawrence Fells" (for when we can't remember a name), "Messieur wins again", "in a very slipshod manner" and countless others.

The teaming of Michael Caine and Steve Martin is also inspired, and they work together well.The best thing about "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" though is the plot (from writers Dale Launer, Stanley Shapiro and Paul Henning). Although relatively implausible, it is very clever and has quite a surprising ending up its sleeve. Definitely a worthwhile film, but do not make the mistake of seeing it too many times.Thursday, August 20, 1992 - Video</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>These Cons are Pros</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was disappointing but not surprising to note that the credits made no reference to the fact that this is a remake of Bedtime Story, even to retaining the names of the two leads, on the other hand both Stanley Shapiro and Paul Henning, who co-wrote Bedtime Story in 1964, share the screenplay credit with Dale Launer, who presumably made the coffee and sharpened the pencils. No one would seriously suggest that Michael Caine and Steve Martin are in the same class as David Niven and Marlon Brando but most people won't have seen Bedtime Story and will find lots to admire here not least the sophistication so sadly lacking in modern Hollywood fare. Just to set a movie on the Riviera invests it with a certain cachet and when you throw in lessons in gracious living you're halfway there. When light comedy becomes dark -as it does here when Martin, seeking to outsmart Caine, turns up in a wheelchair claiming to be paralysed from the waist down; only one man can cure him, a Swiss psychiatrist who charges 50 grand a pop; before you can say gnomes of Zurich Caine appears as the miracle Dr. and whips Martin's bare legs unmercifully in an effort to unmask him - it takes on an extra dimension and Shapiro and Henning pressed all the right buttons to build on this situation. There's a nice denouement when both conmen are 'taken' by a mark and even a twist on that. Until Bedtime Story becomes available on DVD this is a reasonable facsimile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very funny if a bit uneven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American con artist "The Jackal" (Steve Martin) is touring France when he runs into British gentleman Michael Caine. Considering him a "distinguised gentleman" Martin pays no attention until he finds out his new acquaintance is a fellow con artist - and a very successful one at that.Martin decides to move in on his game and provide some competition. Caine offers a deal: whoever can sucker a visiting "soap queen" out of $50,000 first, gets to stay - the loser must pack their bags. They both agree to the bet and soon the slapstick comedy pratfalls ensue."Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" is a very funny movie with some of the funniest scenes of all time - unfortunately in between there's a lot of "filler" that is either too long, unfunny, or downright predictable. But it's at its best when it's providing inspired comic segments.My favorite scene from the movie is the one in which Caine, posing as a doctor, whips a "paralyzed romantic veteran" (Martin) on his legs. The line, "Oh look, he's so happy he's crying" is one of the best one-liners of all time, and Martin's face is a great example of classic slapstick. Martin is better at physical comedy than Jim Carrey and he can also do sophisticated acts as well, which is why he's my favorite comedian of all time - viewing this compared to some of his later more "adult" movies like "Father of the Bride" shows his true range, as he can be totally different. My second favorite sequence is the whole thing with Martin's wacky monkey boy "Rupereveritt" (or however they claim it's spelled!). "Can I go to the bathroom?" "Of course." "Thanks." Martin's face cracks me up every time.Overall this isn't as consistently funny or amusing as Martin's better comedies (including "L.A. Story" and his best, "Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles" which is also multi-layered and better for repeat viewings) - but it is very funny and you could definitely do no better if you're just looking for some good entertainment for a Friday night.4/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best comedies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can just image the fun that Michael Caine and Steve Martin had making this movie. How many scenes must they have had to shoot over because the crew and staff cracked up with laughter? This is a genuine masterpiece of comedy. Martin and Caine score a major home run with the bases loaded for this wonderful farce. The supporting cast fit the situation to a "T." This is far better than the original 1964 film that starred Marlon Brando and David Niven. The two writers of "Bedtime Story" are credited also for "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels." Stanley Shapiro and Paul Henning were joined by Dale Launer for this much better screenplay.A couple reviews thought Martin's character, Freddie, is dumb. Come on! He's incredibly na?ve, as Caine's Lawrence Jamiesson notes early on. But, he's quick to catch on and Lawrence warns Inspector Andre (played by Anton Rodgers) that Freddie is a clever conman. Andre notes that the amateur Freddie goes after small change. But, Lawrence quips back, "You can't be too careful, Andre. After all, a poacher who shoots at rabbits may scare big game away."Both conmen have their share of cunning ? in setting up or preparing for scams. But then, as they encounter a roadblock, each just as quickly cooks up a scheme to give him the upper hand once again. These scenes are hilarious in themselves ? when the camera pans on the face of the respective scoundrel and we see his expression as the scheme clicks in his mind. And then, the carrying out of the scheme brings more laughter. Freddie most often gets the short end of the stick, to everyone's delight because of the howling funny situations that ensue. These two fine actors are a natural match for comedy. It would be nice to see another great script that could bring them together again. The two characters are almost opposites, and thus the perfect match for much laughter. Here's an example toward the end of the film. Freddie throws a fit and says: "Of all the lousy? She is disgusting! She is lying, deceitful, two-faced! She is conniving and she is dishonest!" Lawrence, chuckling, says, "Yes. Isn't she wonderful?"I also liked the locations for much of the shooting ? the French Riviera, around Villefranche and Nice, France. I vacationed there in the summers of 1963 and 1964 while on leave from serving in the Army in Germany. Of course, I didn't stay at the Grand Hotel du Caps-Ferrat or a luxury villa. That area along the Cote d'Azur has one of the most scenic shorelines in the world.One thing in the movie was so obviously wrong, yet everyone seemed to along with it, so I wonder if it wasn't intentional. Could the writers and director have been spoofing the audience? This refers to the scenes of Steve Martin in a military uniform. The trivia section has an item about this ? that he passes himself off as a naval officer, yet he's wearing a U.S. Army dress blues uniform that clearly shows the rank of corporal. This couldn't be a simple oversight, because several characters refer to him as "officer Benson." Jamieson, as a British Naval volunteer reservist surely would know the insignia of ranks on American uniforms, as well as branches of service. I think this may have been intentional and a spoof of the idle rich on the playgrounds of Europe. The point being that if they noticed Freddy at all, they wouldn't know one branch of service or one rank from another. And, one would think that Freddy was smart enough in running his scams, that he would know what uniform he was wearing and what rank it showed. Ergo, my hunch that this was intentional and meant to spoof the audience and the communities of the idle rich who could so easily be taken in by conmen and women. "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" is a must for any comedy film collection. It's one of the funniest movies ever made.</fullReview>

It was funny.But, like a 1930's film that has a problem that could've been solved by a phone call, this film wouldn't stand in the internet era.For instance: a) the women giving money would Google the impostors for links to royalty, or the name of the personb) the scam would've been undone by quick police actionc) the characters would've communicated by cell phone and realized where the other ones wereBut it's an enjoyable film for its time.It shows a bit too much prescience for the characters to guess what will happen, especially for the woman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Up to "Bedtime Story" Standards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" wasn't a remake of "Bedtime Story," it would hold up fairly well. But the fact is the 1964 production with Marlon Brando and David Niven is a far better movie from the first scene to the last. The performances of Michael Caine and Steve Martin are acceptable, unfortunately some of the scenes are a bit overdone. I'm not against slapstick; when it's done right I love it. When it's overdone, I want to put it out for the dogs.Too bad Hollywood doesn't have the guts to produce original material -- and there's plenty out there to use!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS (1988) ***1/2 Steve Martin, Michael Caine, Glenne Headly, Barbara Harris. Martin and Caine make for a wonderfully duplicitous duo of scheming, charming gigolos out to bilk every beautiful heiress they can get at. Crowning moment: Martin's stint as Ruperict the Monkey-Boy. Cuddly-cuddly, don't make me get the gential cuff! Remake of 1964's "Bedroom Story" with David Niven and Marlon Brando.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dirty Rotten Scoundrels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film from director Frank Oz (The Muppets Take Manhattan, Bowfinger) is not a bad comedy. Basically Lawrence Jamieson (Sir Michael Caine) is a sophisticated con artist that can get money out of almost anyone, and Freddy Benson (Steve Martin) has the same ability, but no sophistication. They meet each other, and Freddy forces Lawrence to teach him the skills of high society he needs to become as rich as him. It comes time for Freddy to leave, but he decides to stay longer, and they make a settlement. He and Lawrence make a bet to try and con "soap queen" Janet Colgate (Glenne Headly) to give one of them $50,000, and the person who fails has to leave town. Freddy introduces himself as a crippled from love-loss naval General, and Lawrence is the doctor who could cure him. As you'd expect, they both like to play dirty, and also have situations that almost ruin their scheme, but they are clever enough to get through them. In the end, (a little predictable) Lawrence heard about the American con artist known as "The Jackal", and naturally thought it was Freddy, but in the end, it's Janet! She comes back at the end to Lawrence's mansion as a character, and she knows that Lawrence and Freddy will play along with the new con. Also starring Star Wars' Ian McDiarmid as Arthur and Home Alone 2's Dana Ivey as Mrs. Reed. There are some good laughs, and both Martin and Caine are great in their roles, a good old-fashioned one in a while comedy film. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" is a hilarious movie that will make almost everyone smile. Con-artists Michael Caine and Steve Martin have a competition going: they are both trying to be the first to steal a bundle from Glenne Hedley. However, circumstances will change as both begin to have feelings for the young beauty. Crazy situations and crazier results will keep the audience laughing and watching. A fine comedy all the way around. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a poor remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this again and my opinion didn't change from the first time. This is a pale ghost of the film "Bedtime Story" with David Niven and Marlon Brando on which it is based.Why on earth is Hollywood plundering thousands of brilliant movies and making these tired retreads?I found Steve Martin, whom I normally admire, really acting for the camera in this one and seemingly out of control in several scenes - one being where he's in a jail cell trying to remember a name. Michael Caine was, well, Michael Caine, still the cockney boy but hamming it up aristocratically. David Niven or Cary Grant he ain't and that's what the role calls for.You can see the ending waving from a mile away which is a shame, it removes even the remotest tension from the plot.The scenery stole the movie, the Riviera looks wonderful. Glenne Headley did the best she could but, unfortunately, seems to have sat at the feet of Steve for acting lessons when subtle would have played more believably. Frances Conroy (she of Six Feet Under) is wonderful in a bit part.And the scripting of the mentally challenged 'brother' leaves a nasty taste.6 out of 10. Timewaster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, They Really Are **</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chauvinist Steve Martin meets up with suave, sophisticated Michael Caine in this not very good film. They both have one thing in common, they like to cheat people-big time. Martin has a long way to go.While the music to Puttin' on the Ritz plays, Martin is taught the tricks of the trade by Caine. The latter views Martin as a threat; therefore, he had better watch him while keeping him around.Martin's idea of having women pay for everything since they outlive men will naturally backfire in the presence of Glenne Headly. The film, with corny humor, doesn't sparkle because of the predictable factor as well as the material that is given to the actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK comedy attempt by former Henson and muppet collaborator...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 3/29/2010 -- 4 out of 10 (Dir-Frank Oz): OK comedy attempt by former Henson and muppet collaborator turned director Frank Oz. This movie just didn't have the laughs needed to make a good comedy. Steve Martin and Michael Caine play con artists from different sides of the world who meet up by chance on a train. Martin's character is from America and a little more brash and Caine's character is a more refined English chap. They both make money off of rich women by conning them and Caine's character decides to take on Martin's character as a junior associate mainly to keep him away from the competition while he's in the area. They target a supposed rich woman, played by Glenn Headly, and make a bet as to which one can get money out of her first. Then they find out she's really not that rich and change the bet to see who can bed her first. The story is pretty convoluted and the humor only comes out in a couple of Martin's individual scenes. The actor's really don't seem to loosen up together very much. The woman turns out to be more than they expected and twists things up a lot(although I won't give away the ending). The unbelievability(if that's a word) of the story and the lack of big laughs doesn't make this movie that worthwhile even though it's OK. Oz hasn't really done that well with live action in his other efforts and this one is no different. It's OK to stick with the muppets if you want Frank, that would be OK with me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A re-make of Bedtime Story; surprisingly, not an improvement.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of the 1964 film "Bedtime Story" starring David Niven and Marlon Brando with Shirley Jones and Dody Goodman. Bedtime Story is easily as funny as Dirty Rotten Scoundrels and rings a little truer. David Niven plays a much better sophisticate than Caine who never quite completely conceals his cockney accent. Surprisingly, Brando is every bit as funny as Steve Martin and in fact, Steve Martin's performance in DRS is a carbon copy of Brando's. Shirley Jones just seems more innocent and vulnerable than Glenne Headly and Dody Goodman is just funnier than Barbara Harris. Frankly, this is a movie that didn't need a re-make and I recommend Bedtime Story over Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. But, maybe you'll want to see both and decide for yourself. Incidentally, a musical comedy version by the same people who converted the movies Hairspray and The Full Monty into Broadway musicals is scheduled to open on Broadway in 2005.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thin, predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only beauty in DRS is the Riveria landscape. The plot is predictable (as is usual in comedies dealing with drifters and grafters and con-men - oh my). Glenn Headley's performance (as Janet Colgate, an innocent American who finds her naive self on the Mediterrean coast through good luck) is an effective parody of the goof-girls of earlier cinema, though the writing is so poor that the punch of her role in the plot is telegraphed much too early. Martin and Caine coast through the film, bringing nothing sharp or vinegary to roles that really need it. Martin does pull off an eerie allusion (or tribute) to Jerry Lewis, but it feels so much like an allusion that it fails as itself. (One starts thinking about Lewis instead of following the immediate story.) Such films trade on our willingness to forget how the wealthy live at the expense of those of us who work, but stop short of a critique of such exploitation. Nothing new about that, of course, and, when it's done well - as in "The Thin Man," for example - we don't care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe I'M missing something, but when I read jhclues comments form Salem, I wondered whether we had been watching the same film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steve Martin is a good comedian, often funny and, when he is not overacting, as he does in this film, he can be entertaining. Michael Caine is the quintessential gangster; East End Alfie; the pimp in Mona Lisa: the crook in Shiner; all tailor made for his rough, one dimensional talent.He plays crude to perfection. Four-letter words trip from his mouth with ease.But an English Prince in Beaumont-sur-Mer!!!An aristocrat Caine could never be. One has only to watch the original "Bedtime Story" (A confusing title), with David Niven playing Jamieson to perfection and the great Marlon Brando his rival.Niven; Elegant; suave; funny; the epitome of civilised good manners. Brando, brash; coarse; very funny.If "Bedtime Story" ever makes it to the Roxy in Salem, jhclues should treat himself to a night out &amp; compare it with the rubbish called "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sad imitation...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film and have to tell everyone: Don't waste your time on this pale, watered-down nineties version or copy of the much better 1964 film, "Bedtime Story," starring David Niven and Marlon Brando. Brando and Niven were really funny and some of the dialog between the two is priceless. I'm afraid that Martin and Caine, although very funny in other films, just can't seem to make it happen in this re-make.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How much worse could it get?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is banal, juvenile, idiotic and patronises the audience. It's naive of the director and writers to assume that anyone would ever want to watch it. The acting was OK from Caine, and mediocre from Martin. If this were made today it would have gone straight to video.There is nothing that could spoil it because there's nothing to spoil. The characters are two dimensional, the only redeeming feature is the setting.Caine does a passable imitation of David Niven, of course, and Martin a passable imitation of Martin. Apart from everything with Adam Sandler in it I can recommend no movie less. Well, apart from The Village, which is one of the worst movies ever made, that is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie completely copied from a Tamil Film starring Nagesh, Cho S Ramaswamy, Monorama in mid 1960's. This film ran for several days and was remade in Hindi with Amir khan &amp; Salman khan starring opposite where Ravina Tandon &amp; Karishma Kapoor. And also recently same plot was copied in Vijayakanth movie starring Namitha, Vadivel, Basker of Selvi fame.The movie is directed by KB.This is one of the full length comedies of 1960's.The main issue here is who copied from who is it Hollywood from Kollywood and Bollywood from Kollywood or Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Trailer is Better Than the Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a colossal waste of time. One would think with two such fine stars in the lead, there would be a good script to go with it, but no go!Two con artists try to outdo each other by swindling people out of their money, but are taken in by a third party. Besides the questionable taste of the plot itself, the story is further tainted by poking fun at everything from people with disabilities to the charity of strangers, to love itself. Honesty and selflessness are thrown aside in a scurrilous rush to self-enrichment at the expense of other people's better nature.I was actually sucked into this film by watching the trailer of Caine and Martin casually pushing a man off a pier while walking by, and thought this would be a rich tale of two misfits; perhaps something on the scale of _The Man Who Would Be King_. Nope. DRS is a tasteless bath in the art of fraud and grand theft, which, if you've ever been a victim, is no laughing matter.</fullReview>
