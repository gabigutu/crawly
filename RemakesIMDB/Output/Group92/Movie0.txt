		<shortDescription>FYI - A little history on Bedtime Story and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw it in the late '60's on TV when I was home from school. Years later I became a screenwriter and got a call from David Bowie's production company. He and Mick jagger wanted to do a movie together and hoped I would write it. I suggested doing a remake of Bedtime Story with Bowie as Lawrence Jamison and Mick as Freddy.They were both interested, the studio (UA) was interested, but the movie had been made at Universal and there was no way they could get the rights. A number of other studios were interested, but couldn't wrestle the right away from Universal.Turns out no had bothered to do a copyright search. I did. Turns out the rights had reverted back to the original writer/producer Stanley Shapiro. We met at the Pink Turtle (a coffee shop at what was the Beverly Wilshire) and did a deal on a napkin.The original title was King of Hill. Since Stanley was the man behind the Doris Day/Rock Hudson/Cary Grant movies - he decided to write (with Maurice Richlin - who went on to pen the original Pink Panther) a movie where Cary Grant and Rock Hudson would compete for Doris Day.Apparently, Cary had asked Rock to do a movie with him, but Rock had turned him down. So Cary didn't want to do a movie with Rock. And Doris wouldn't do the movie without the both of them. Hence it was re-cast with Niven, Brando and Shirley Jones.Stanely said this movie didn't do all that well in its original run. He felt that the movie fell flat in the south because of Brando championing civil rights.Thought I do prefer my ending, but this is nevertheless a very charming movie. Which is why I tried to preserve as much as the original as possible. Hey, if ain't broke, don't fix it. And certainly don't change it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marlon Brando is just amazing in this HILARIOUS film.Most people don't understand Brando's career choices during the sixties.But I think that as years go by,they will.His ideas were way ahead of his time.His talent and range is unbelievable.Every actor tries to imitate his intensity (deniro,penn,nolte,.....) with no success.Definitely the king of acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nifty, underrated comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of those movies whose presence on TV would guarantee my entire family's viewing, even if it came on in the middle of the night. David Niven is a suave fleecer of gullible women, who tries to teach novice Marlon Brando a thing or two. Ultimately, both set their sights on soap heiress Shirley Jones, and the games begin.Brando's brief impersonation of Niven is worth the price of admission (or rental, or whatever). Superior to the pretty-good remake, "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brando had a nice comic touch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Between this and Guys and Dolls and the Godfather parody w/ Mathew Broderick, Marlon showed that he could be very funny. Sort of like Errol Flynn, I wish he had been given more opportunities.I have looked in vain for this on DVD it was supposed to have been released a couple of years ago, I'm not sure what happened.As noted many will be familiar with the remake (Dirty Rotten Scoundrels), though I prefer the original. There is a priceless scene where Marlon (as Freddy)is caught with his pants off after seducing the burgomeister's daughter in a German town. He explains that he is part of the new Exercise instruction program and he begins doing calisthenics as he makes his exit.I also liked when David Niven and Brando first meet and realize that they are competing in the same line of work albeit at different levels.Highly recommended.'shoes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True comedy with Brando as an outstandingly funny actor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"! That is a mere imitation and a poor one at that. This is the original and by far one of the most outstanding comedies on film. There is no foul language, violence, gratuitous sex or any other artifice. Bedtime Story really relies on nothing more than a great script and outstanding actors. I have seen the movie many times since my childhood and I am happy to say that my children (both adults now) also share my views.Just buy the DVD (freely available from the UK - why not the USA????? Shame, shame).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being the basis for "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels," I couldn't help watching this one. I had the bad fortune of seeing the remake first, however, and they are scene-by-scene identical up until the last bits. I think that I liked "Bedtime Story" more, however. Marlon Brando did a much better job than Steve Martin did 25 years later. David Niven played the part better too. "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" twisted the end of the movie and set it up for a sequel, but that never came through. I like it fine, anyway, just how it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Comedy, Outdoes Dirty Rotten Scoundrels Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young trim Brando as Freddie Benson, shows his comedic talent and versatility in this movie classic. David Niven plays the suave sophisticate role better than Michael Cane. Dirty Rotten Scoundrels was a good comedy, Bedtime Story (the original) was even better. BTS was so good someone thought they could do better. It's a shame that the many people I have talked to who love DRS didn't even know it was a remake of this excellent film. Brando's scheme at the beginning of the movie to seduce the beautiful peasant girl by aging a Poloroid picture of her farmhouse claiming it was the home his grandmother lived in gives some insight to his character. The fact that Brando is just in it for the sex and Niven is doing it for big money sets the plot for the rest of the movie. Niven sees this interloper as a threat and we are off to the races for the rest of the plot. Both Michael Cane and Steve Martin did a good job in the remake but the Brando/Niven combination is unforgettable. Too bad it is not available on DVD for the US market. A British PAL version was released in 2004. I hope the US-DVD is not far behind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple, but pretty funny--apparently Brando felt so, too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lawrence Jameson (David Niven) lives in a castle in France, and may be best described as the quintessential rotten womanizer. He systematically seduces wealthy women to his wealthy home, whereupon the victims are persuaded, in one way or another, to give him large amounts of their fortunes. While Jameson is certainly an unsympathetic fellow when it comes down to it, he is very able to fool nearly anyone with his apparent charm. It turns out that he has a rival, however; Freddy Benson (Marlon Brando) lives by the same sort of principles. The two swindlers eventually meet, and as the result of an argument they agree to engage in a bet. The first of them to successfully get 25 000 dollars out of the pocket of Janet Walker (Shirley Jones), the gentle and pretty daughter of a wealthy business man, should be declared as the true king of womanizers. While Freddy pretends to be paralyzed due to a sad love story, in order to evoke empathy from Mrs. Walker, Jameson--unpredicted by Freddy--turns up in the role as his rival's supposed psychiatrist!Initially intended as another vehicle for Rock Hudson and Doris Day (as well as Cary Grant), BEDTIME STORY instead turned out to provide David Niven with yet another opportunity to perform the kind of role for which he is probably best-remembered today. He is essentially rather similar here to "The Phantom" in the first PINK PANTHER-movie, to just name one example. Even so, he is definitely hilarious; his facial expressions alone are sometimes able to make me laugh out loud. The film does also offer a quite convincing demonstration of Marlon Brando's talent as a comic performer, and furthermore that his capabilities as such has been unjustly under-appreciated. While often praised as the greatest dramatic actor ever seen on the screen, the humorous performances of Brando are rarely given more than passing mention. It may be true that all of Brando's most memorable performances are of the dramatic kind; Stanley Kowalski in A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE and Terry Malloy in ON THE WATERFRONT being two obvious examples. However, I do not accept this as a valid reason to entirely neglect his attempts at other kinds of roles. Brando himself may have felt that he couldn't do comedy well; but he did admit, in his autobiography 30 years later, that he found making BEDTIME STORY a delight, possibly the only time he truly enjoyed working in a film. He claimed to have laughed so hard during certain scenes that he often had to leave the room, but even then it was hard for the performers to ignore his howls of laughter.BEDTIME STORY is an entirely undemanding piece of entertainment, a very light comedy indeed, but also a very enjoyable one, if you are in that kind of mood and just wants to laugh after a stressful day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brando said, "The most fun I ever had making a film"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was ten when the movie came out, my dad encouraged me to watch it years later when it played on television. I was hooked...Brando is uproarious as the American GI in Europe, an egotist, sometimes crude, a hustler, preying on gorgeous woman through sympathy, his good looks and his almost pathetic hilarious charm....David Niven is the slick, cool, rich charming Englishman and yes, he's also as conniving as Brando. Though Niven is a bit smarter than "Freddy" (Brando) - It makes for a weird but funny and brief partnership between Niven and Brando, to seduce &amp; fleece some very rich, sometimes beautiful, but always naive, trusting &amp; very willing women.And thus begins an even funnier competition between Brando and Niven, as the movie really gets rolling along...as each character underestimates the other in cons and setups, then untimely outwits the other...all the way until the final twist of an ironic and funny ending to the film.Yes, there are indeed a couple of silly and corny scenes...but overall the movie is a very funny farce, as enjoyable &amp; well written comedy to come out of that early 60's era, (1964) or any era for that matter....Brando is truly terrific - Accept no substitutes, i.e., "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conmen On a Train</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For David Niven, Bedtime Story was the kind of part he could play in his sleep although he's quite wide awake here. But for Marlon Brando this was his second foray into comedy, he would not do another until the Nineties when he was accepting roles for money to pay his son's lawyers. Brando does quite well in Bedtime Story as the sleazy GI conman. We meet both of them separately at the beginning, Niven in his guise as a prince living in a palace on the French Riviera, fleecing money from rich tourists trying to free his country from the rebels, presumably Communists. And Brando manages to con his commanding officer Parley Baer more worried about getting his promotion to general than in dealing out justice to the guy who disgraced his daughter into an early discharge with a private separation package.Brando as civilian meets with Niven on board a train heading to the Riviera and brags about his exploits and talks about trying his luck on the rich babes there. Niven not wanting any competition arranges a small frame up with the cooperation of the police chief Aram Stephen. Of course when Brando gets wise to it, they're forced into a partnership of sorts.Niven sort of glides right into a part that he's done on many occasions, in this case not even having to rely solely on his considerable charm to carry a weak film. Brando had done comedy on screen before in Teahouse of the August Moon, but the role of Freddy Benson, GI Conman extraordinary fits him far better than Sakini in Teahouse.If Paul Henning and Stanley Shapiro on hiatus from their rural franchise at CBS had really wanted to make this a better film, they would have invested a surprise in Shirley Jones traditional good girl character. Remember she won an Oscar for playing against type in Elmer Gantry as a prostitute. Think of the ending in the John Wayne film The Train Robbers and think how it would have really fit here. Still Bedtime Story is not a bad film and it even got remade as the Steve Martin classic, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. And hats off everyone to Dody Goodman, the legendary Fanny of Omaha.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, Brando Could Do Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has a history of name confusion to rival Hitchcock's SECRET AGENT, SABOTAGE, and SABOTEUR, or HERE COMES MR. JORDAN, HEAVEN CAN WAIT, and HEAVEN CAN WAIT. There is a 1941 comedy with Loretta Young and Frederic March called BEDTIME STORY about Broadway theater people. Then this film was created in 1964, and marked the only time David Niven and Marlon Brando co-starred in a comedy. Then the 1964 comedy was remade in 1988 with Michael Caine and Steve Martin in the Niven and Brando film, but was now called DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS. That is the title that shall always be recalled with this story, especially since it has been turned into a successful musical show in London and New York City. Truth be told, I favor the 1988 version, because the two male leads manage to squeeze more reality out of their characters than Niven and Brando did. Brando had too much intelligence for playing the slovenly conman Freddy Benson, while Steve Martin showed his intellectual limitations far better. Niven got carried away showing Jamieson's intellectual philanthropy (from the proceeds of his swindles), while Caine took the same material and showed it for what it really was - an emotional hobby. That said the 1964 film was good within it's own limits (not notable for nearly a quarter century). The only other alteration was a final surprise which makes the remake much superior.Lawrence Jamieson has set himself up in a mansion on the gold coast of the Riviera, and attracts wealthy women (with the assistance of the local police chief - who is in his pay). He convinces wealthy women (pretending he is doing it in a noble cause) to give him thousands of dollars for the purpose of freeing his country from the tyrants (it is obvious he is supposed to be a deposed Balkan monarch, fighting the Communists). The con is perfect, and the machinery is well oiled. But along comes Freddy Benson, an American conman, who threatens to ruin the con Jamieson sets up. They try to work together for awhile, but Jamieson sees Freddy as an apprentice (at best a junior partner) and that irks Freddy. So they set up a bet - winner takes over the local Riviera town as his preserve. They will both go after a new target, and whoever gets $10,000.00 from her first wins. Soon, a young American woman (Shirley Jones) shows up as "the American Soap Queen". Freddy pretends that he is a soldier suffering from some psychological shock that has left him crippled (he is actually spoofing, in part, his serious performance in his first movie THE MEN where he was a crippled war hero). Jamieson pretends he is a famous Vienese psychologist who Freddie claims he has tried to contact. And the film gets into a series of feints and pretenses that both men play on each other (to get them out of the way while they work out their wiles on Jones). Jones is a perfectly decent type, who gradually is very attracted to Brando. SPOILERS COMING UP.It turns out that Jones is the winner of a big contest from the American Soap Company, and she is not a millionaire. Niven learns this first and then Brando. But Brando has slowly gotten to like Jones too, so he ends up returning to America with her as her husband. Niven accepts that he must struggle on as a bachelor to the end - and heads back to the glittering life of the Riviera.That is not how the remake ended. Jones' character turned out to be a very successful female con-artist, who beats Caine and Martin. Caine, of course, fully appreciates the artistry of the woman (Martin's just angry), but she returns, as she sees both men can be useful partners to her schemes (especially the smarter Caine). So the three of them go after their rich prey with glee at the end.The remake had the better ending...hand's down! It kept the surprises coming up to the conclusion of the film. But the original had some nice moments. Brando playing the silent assistant to Niven as his apprentice has to play a half-wit brother Prince to Niven's exiled King (Prince Rupprecht), who wears "Napoleon" suits. He also, towards the end, does a nice brief imitation of Niven as the art and culture lover, admiring a "Stradavarius violin". The Chief of Police helping Niven also has an interesting plan to get rid of Brando with a gun whose fingerprints will lead to a weird historical dead end (you have to hear the plan to understand it). So I would recommend the film as a worthy comedy, but one that eventually was far improved upon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest films I've ever seen.(possible spoiler in first paragraph)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a bedtime fairy tale, with princes, wolves and preyed-upon damsels, castles and woods. Fairy tales are often designed to be instructive, or to inculcate a moral. 'Bedtime Story' is instructive - we learn how to cheat, lie, humiliate, plot, bribe, wager, impersonate, amuse; and is cheerfully amoral. Like the traditional fairy tale, it ends in marriage, which is another word for soul-destroying prison, the final trap set by a master conman.'Story' is one of the few genuinely funny comedies from the 1960s, and I can't understand why it hasn't been acclaimed as such, or developed even a cult following. It may not be very cinematically inventive, but there are sequences here of such audacity, cruelty and gasping hilarity that it puts even the Peter Sellers bits of 'The Pink Panther' movies to shame. Its influence, furthermore, can be seen in two of the most important films of the last five years. Like 'In the Company of Men', two men coldly wager on winning the affections of an innocent woman. Like 'The Idiots', one of the characters pretends to be disabled to 'subvert' bourgeois normality (in this case, to wring money and jewels from them). Maybe this is why comment on the film is silent, some people confusing a character as morally callous as Freddy Benson, who would impersonate the disabled for his own gain, with a general attitude of mockery towards the disabled. It is true that these scenes are very uncomfortable, which is why they are so eye-poppingly funny; maybe it IS offensive to use being disabled as character short-hand - even though it is a good metaphor for Brando's physicality being paralysed by mental grace, he still gets to walk up again.I don't know. I loved 'Me Myself and Irene' too. Maybe I'm not a nice person. The film's air of cold bonhomie extends to its structure which operates with a mathematical precision appropriate to its German setting, not only in its three act structure (introduction of characters; working together; final wager), but in the way in introduces its characters, seperately, before putting them together, like a theorem, or a chemical experiment. The chief joy of this film is the way it plays on their stars' very well-developed personae, both public and private; David Niven is the conman with perfect English elegance and etiquette, with suave, quick, alert movements figuring the practical clockwork in his head, whose sense of morality and decency conveniently gets competition out of the way. His performance plays most obviously on his 'Pink Panther' role, but there is a touch of Phileas Fogg in his Freudian doctor impersonation, which allows him to inflict clinically methodical cruelty, to uproarious results. Brando, meanwhile, is a comic revelation. Like Robert De Niro, his serious, dramatic roles are always laced with a menacing, self-aware humour, but his straight comic vehicles have been humorless mugfests. He is in his element here as the kind of brash, unprincipled, cheating, thieving, blackmailing American the real Brando despises, making fun of the solemn brilliance of his best films, especially 'The Men', with that familiar Brando whine and hurt-baby-face-in-tough-guy-body look. Because this is a film about acting, about two of cinema's greatest performers, from totally different traditions, trying to outskill each other; there is genuine admiration to be seen as each watches the other do his stuff, just as each character's bluff is outbluffed by the other. And this is what gives this marvellous film its depth, the idea of acting in life, of assuming roles, of constructing identities, as a necessary defence against the stolid domesticity to which Brando is apparently condemned. The film seems to have a moral after all - better the settled married man over the aging, 'free' bachelor, which Jameson acknowledges, while mock-sadly making off to indulge that freedom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BEDTIME STORY (Ralph Levy, 1964) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before tackling the film proper, I'd like to point out some fascinating trivia first: originally, this was planned with Cary Grant and Rock Hudson in mind who were to compete for Doris Day and, allegedly, it was almost revived as a starring vehicle for (brace yourselves) David Bowie and Mick Jagger (!!)?before saner minds prevailed and we got DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS (1988) ? with Michael Caine and Steve Martin replacing David Niven and Marlon Brando respectively ? instead. Anyway, the premise was quite original at the time ? rival con-men decide to collaborate but clash over fleecing a woman who turns out to be poor ? and the film itself was actually better than I was expecting: in any case, "The most vulgar and embarrassing film of the year" ? as The Daily Express had deemed the film on its release ? it certainly wasn't!Given that BEDTIME STORY was one of Brando's efforts from his lean period (and, uncharacteristically, a comedy at that), I didn't have high hopes for it initially ? especially since some of the other "comedies" I had seen Brando in had been pretty desperate attempts: A COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG (1967) and CANDY (1968; see above). Still, that the Method actor was capable of handling lighter material than the brooding dramas he was best-known for, was already evident early on in his career with GUYS AND DOLLS (1955) and THE TEAHOUSE OF THE AUGUST MOON (1956), but this is perhaps his most engaging performance in this field; that said, it's rather disquieting to see him mugging like a Jerry Lewis wannabe (when posing as Niven's half-wit brother)! His co-star isn't particularly taxed by his role ? having often played the roué, it's one he could have done in his sleep ? but he's always good value in this type of light entertainment; ditto Shirley Jones, who plays it more or less straight.The delightful opening, lending fairy-tale connotations to the narrative (hence the title) and the various schemes by which the two male stars attempt to outwit one another in order to obtain Jones' favors (and, in the process, her money) constitute the film's highlights; these include the famous scene in which Brando poses as a paraplegic ? recalling his celebrated debut performance in Fred Zinnemann's powerful social drama THE MEN (1950) ? as a result of which Jones arranges for him to be "cured" by renowned shrink Niven! I watched the film via the R2 DVD from Orbit Media, presenting the Universal film in a full-screen format; I haven't been able to ascertain what the original aspect ratio was, but I didn't find the compositions overly compromised; for the record, BEDTIME STORY is still unavailable on R1 DVD and one wonders what held it from being included in Universal's four-film 2-Disc Set of "The Marlon Brando Franchise Collection"...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Niven is great, Brando is not such a good choice as Freddie Benson.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Bedtime Story' is the earlier movie that 'inspired' the more recent 'Dirty, Rotten Scoundrels.' I say inspired because, although most characters are the same, and the predominant story line is the same, including many identical scenes, the two movies end quite differently. Enough so to make them different movies, instead of the latter being a remake.I enjoyed 'Bedtime Story', but I strongly prefer 'Dirty, Rotten Scoundrels', which has come to be my all-time favorite comedy. I will watch it over and over, but one viewing of 'Bedtime Story' is enough for me. I never liked Brando as an actor, his delivery of lines, which sounds to me like a speech impediment, is distracting. I only liked him in the 'Godfather' movies, where he was the perfect choice.I also thought the 'Rupreckt' sub-character was played much better by Steve Martin, who is clearly better than Brando ever could be in this type of role. Niven is perfect here, even better than Michael Caine, and I love Shirley Jones (Janet Walker, not Colgate) in anything, but they are not enough to bring this marginal comedy any higher than '7' of 10.Plus, 'Bedtime Story' was obviously filmed on a set, with filmed scenes of Germany and southern France shown in the background. In contrast, 'Scoundrels' was filmed in France, which makes it a much more authentic movie.MAJOR SPOILER FOLLOWS - In 'Bedtime Story' a telegram back to Janet exposes the hoax, but she doesn't know Freddie is involved, so marries him, with Freddie moving back to the States to work in the soap factory, while Niven's character is tracking down a new target. In 'Scoundrels', it turns out that Janet has scammed both of them, disappears, and turns up later, with a group of investors, looking for help from the boys to work this real estate scam.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As it may be better known to some modern filmgoers...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...the original version of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, a 1988 comedy. I just saw the original again for the first time in years and found this tale of two competitive French Riviera con artists fleecing rich women a charming, polished delight.David Niven is perfectly cast, bringing his charm and droll humour to the role of the wealthy, well established con artist, working in collaboration with the corrupt captain of police, to suavely pluck the rich female tourists arriving in his affluent but small Mediterranean town, without their ever knowing that they have been plucked. Along, though, comes a brash American con artist interloper (Marlon Brando), threatening to spoil the pickings for Niven. From there the story takes off.The film looks like parts of it may have been filmed in the Riviera, adding considerably to the sunshine kissed affluent atmosphere of this handsome production. And there is often some rather clever dialogue. At one point Brando, in talking to the French town police officer, says, "She caught me with another woman. You're French. You understand." "To be with another woman, that is French," replies the Frenchman, "To be caught, that is American." That same line of dialogue, by the way, would re-appear in the remake (Stanley Shapiro has writing credit on both films).Niven brings his expected aplomb to his role. Did any actor ever look more at home in a white tuxedo? But Brando is an unexpected pleasure to watch in this film, as well, gleefully leaping into the role of the lower class brash Yankee ready to exploit the gullibility of innocent women. At one point Niven says to him, "By no stretch of the imagination would I associate myself with someone like you. You're crude." "Well, so is oil until you refine it into high octane gasoline," says Brando, wanting to be taught all the tricks of sophisticated film flammery at the hands of an old master like Niven.Both Bedtime Story and its Dirty Rotten Scoundrels remake are well worth viewing. Where the remake has an edge over the original, though, is in the casting of Steve Martin, who has a few sequences of physical comedy brilliance when he poses as "Ruprecht," Niven's brain addled "brother," who acts, at times, like he's almost half monkey. These scenes are hysterically funny, thanks to Martin. Michael Caine plays the Niven role in the remake, and he's more than fine.The real difference - the ending of the original shows the remaining romance of the production code era, that love can flourish even under the most lurid of circumstances. The remake's ending shows all the cynicism that you would expect in a post-Watergate, post-Vietnam world. Both endings work well. I'll let you watch and find out what I mean.</fullReview>

While Steve Martin did a good enough job, i can only imagine how much more interesting/funny it would be with someone else doing Freddy. When Steve Martin says towards the middle of the film that he's younger than Michael Caine, all i could think was...by 2 years?! Something that i almost NEVER do, is like the remake as much as the original. In this case, i almost like both equally. The original is still slightly better, mostly because of the quality of actors. The original ending is slightly better as well. While i like the ending of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, the ending in the original is much more satisfying... :D Now, if only i could own both on a high quality DVD/BluRay in Widescreen...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very funny comedy .The repetitive side ("My granny is sick...She needs an operation...Alas I've not got enough money! Poor dear") is no problem.On the contrary,it becomes funnier and funnier as the movie progresses."Bedtime story" hints at fairy tales characters ,particularly the Little Red Riding Hood and Prince Charming (David Niven may be a fake shrink ,but he is a true prince short of the readies,a prince going as far as to "create" an evil prince in his château).But the most successful gags are provided by the spoof on all the Freudian works which were thriving since the forties (their heyday with such directors as Siodmak,Hitchcock,Lang ,Tourneur ..).Brando about to faint and pretending he is suffering each time he sees lovers dance is a nod to all these movies in which the hero(ine) couldn't stand a certain thing,because in his/her past something bad happened.I even suspect the writers of having borrowed the scene in which Shirley Jones and Brando are on the beach (You can do it on my legs too)from the famous scene on the boat when Marilyn Monroe tries to arouse Tony Curtis's desire .A treat for big babies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pillow Talk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was director Ralph Levy's first feature film - he made only one more, Do Not Disturb - and if he seems assured at directing light comedy it's because he spent several years directing the likes of Burns and Allen, Jack Benny, Lucille Ball etc on TV. Co-writer Stanley Shapiro and Paul Henning had written between them several Doris Day-Rock Hudson-Cary Grant movies so everything was in place for highly polished, classy, sophisticated goings-on with a very welcome - especially today - slice of non-PC. If you've only seen the insipid remake, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, relax, you're in for a treat, so settle down and see how the Big Boys do it. On paper Niven and Brando shouldn't work representing as they do diametrically opposed styles but on screen and against the odds it works splendidly and Shirley Jones has just the right volume of 'niceness' to make the perfect foil. A barrel of laffs whichever way you slice it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shapiro does it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you saw Stanley Shapiro's other movies you will notice that this is a variation on the same theme. But it's still enjoyable.This movie could be considered very misogynous if it weren't so misanthropic. Unlike previous Shapiro productions, in this one, women are described as the stronger gender, but depicted as almost another species, gullible beyond belief. In previous films women were smooth operators in their own right. But the comparative paleness of one gender in this one, is probably the result of so much time being devoted to tarring and feathering the other gender. Shapiro is the master of compassionate cynicism. Niven's character is just preposterously wonderful: an urbane, slightly world-weary crook who has really "arrived" and whose exquisite taste prompts him to be a patron of the vanishing arts and crafts! Brando's is upstart, uncouth vulgarity personified. There may be geopolitical implications here. The happy ending is of course, obligatorily contrived, something out of "The Tender Trap", to satisfy the censors. This is a most delightful farce for connoisseurs. I haven't seen the remake, but can it be better than this?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine comedy and acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bedtime Story is a fine comedy with two superb actors. The story, the rhythm of the movie and the acting is characteristic of the best period of the English, American, Italian and French comedy. No special effects, just a good story and good acting. Excellent!. Good comedies in the fifties, sixties and seventies were common, Bedtime Story is one, Prudence and the Pill, The Pink Panther, How to Murder Your Wife, The Statue, The Ladykillers, etc? I do not like re-makes in general, but I hate bad re-makes. The bad news is that the list of re-makes is growing. Is it because they lack creativity and ingenuity? Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is a really bad one. I wonder why Steve Martin keeps trying to show the world how lousy actor and worse comedian he is compared to Brando or Peter Sellers in the Pink Panther. The same for the 2004 version of The Ladykillers, it is awful. So, my recommendation is: stick to the originals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brando meets Niven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The oddball pairing of Marlon Brando and David Niven works very well. They're con men on the Riviera who play a very funny game of oneupmanship as they con one rich woman after another. Things gets dicey when Shirley Jones shows up. Niven is great, but it's Brando (very much a stranger to comedy) who is hysterical. He really shows his comic range, whether he's acting like a helpless invalid or as Niven's phony feral brother. Though set in the south of France, this comedy has a very stylized studio feel to it thanks to director Ralph Levy. Levy, a veteran TV director (he worked on a lot of Jack Benny programs) keeps the pace moving and he's very much abetted by a clever script by 1960s high gloss experts Stanley Shapiro and Paul Henning. Dodie Goodman &amp; Marie Windsor pop up as two of the pair's unfortunate victims.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't expect much from this movie.I saw the Steve Martin/Michael Caine remake, I tend to like Brando in movies, so I wanted to see it purely out of curiosity. The fact that it is not generally available left me guessing it was probably not a very good movie. That it was a light comedy from the sixties did not seem to bode well. And as much as I tend to like Brando in movies, I always have a vague foreboding that any of his movies will be one of the very BAD ones he made.I found a copy on Amazon.com and added it to my wish list and kind of forgot it. One of these days, I thought, I will get around to watching it.Then for Christmas my step-mother got it for me.But it turned out to be region 2, so I couldn't watch it anyway.Finally I got a region-free player (I already had three other movies that I got in a similar way that were non-region-1.) And I watched this last night.This movie had me HOWLING, at times at least.There is a scene towards the start. Brando's character is trying to seduce the town Burgermeister's daughter. He has managed to strip down to his underwear under rather bizarre pretenses.Unexpectedly, her dad, the Burgermeister, walks in at just that moment.Brando says: "Good evening sir ... I suppose you're WONDERING what I'm DOING here!" Now I know that's not funny to read. But you have to see Brando's facial expression at just that moment. It is truly hilarious.I don't know how to describe it. It's like a mix of cunning, genius, utter stupidity and complete insanity all at the same time. If it weren't the early sixties I would say it also threw cokehead psychosis in there ... which, undoubtedly, is not the case, but it is so completely INSANE and conniving that you could throw anything in the description.I rewound it three times and played it back and it had me howling every time.I have seen Brando be funny in interviews (with Dick Cavett, for instance) but I thought Brando in a comedy would be painful. But this is not just good, it's great. In my opinion anyway; comedy is a funny thing.Anyway it is not just that one scene; that one, if you see the movie, hopefully you will see what I mean. There are a number of scenes that I think are comic gold. Brando outflanking his commanding Colonel. Brando blithely explaining the facts of life to David Niven when they first meet. Brando playing the mentally-challenged young Prince.In fact really, a lot of the best moments are, in my opinion, Brando as a comic. Which blows my mind, I tend to associate him with serious, even over-the-top-serious, roles.My personal review then overall is that this movie has a large number of scenes that are extremely funny and if you like good comedy, are well worth going to the trouble of finding a copy and even getting a region-free player.Now, I don't think this movie is perfect, by a long shot.The one scene with Brando and the Burgermeister's daughter, after the great moment that impressed me so much, Brando walks out, doing calisthenics as he goes.This to me is a lame, TV-situation-comedy kind of pratfall.There are, similarly, some moments that feel very weak, like something on "I Love Lucy" at its worst.Worse ... as much as I loved a lot of this movie, honestly, I think it only really holds up well about half-way through.Somewhere around the half-way mark, I think they had basically taken advantage of the really good comedic potential of the premise. After a certain point, the really stand-out comedic moments are gone, and the movie is just developing and resolving it's plot.I can't see how they could have got around it, the plot had to work it's way out. But it's just not funny anymore. Not -really- funny. I can't think of any really funny moments after Shirley Jones has really gotten involved in the plot.Despite that, I still think this is a very funny movie well worth seeing, I highly recommend it, and if your sense of humor is anything like mine, you will get some good laughs about halfway through.I can't imagine watching it that far without having the urge to see how the plot works out, so you will probably watch the second half.Maybe you can catch up on your email while you see how it ends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterclass in How Not To Do...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having enjoyed Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, the 1980s comedy with Michael Caine and Steve Martin, i was intrigued to learn it was a remake of a 1964 film, Bedtime Story. The story is mostly the same: an elegant English conman on the Riviera is annoyed to find his pitch invaded by an uncouth American huckster. They briefly become partners, then rivals.In the original, the leads are taken by David Niven and Marlon Brando, of all people. But it's a comedy masterclass - in how not to do comedy. Just about every scene in the remake milks the full comic potential far better.In DRS, there's a scene where Freddie the Yank conman is thrown into a French jail. Steve Martin has a loud check shirt, a big white Panama hat and big shades, he's the epitome of the loud American abroad and out of his depth as, leaning against the bars,he goes all self- pitying and pleading to the unimpressed French inspector. Watching the original we find that Martin filched the entire performance from Brando, with one crucial difference - Martin is funny. Brando - he just ain't funny...At one point, Freddie is asked if he has a reliable local character witness. Martin goes through a minute of exasperated tip-of-his-tongue recall, jumping up and down, banging his head until he gets it at last. Brando just gives him the name. Brando seems to be enjoying himself, but Martin has the comic's gleeful sadism/masochism towards his character's plight.Later you may recall Caine is required to impersonate a German psychotherapist. He has a cold sadistic tone that works well against Martin's horrified incredulity. Niven, who plays the same role, is called upon to impersonate a Swiss doctor. And just plays him as Niven, with the same voice and everything. Critics say Caine is always the same, but Niven though urbane really is shown to be a one-note actor in this.The comic scenes are generally leaden, though to be fair Martin borrowed Rupret's hulking suspicious demeanor from Brando, except again he's funny and Brando is not. Worst of all, the film ditches the surprise twist of DRS, ending with a real cop out.They could have cast it with Jerry Lewis as Freddie and maybe Dean Martin as the smooth one, or even as a Hope and Crosby vehicle. But bland Niven and unfunny Brando sink it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think that catcha22 was a little kind in his comparison with the 1988 remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Niven was the quintessential English gentleman. Dapper, suave, without ever being pushy. He glided through his many roles with consummate ease. I can understand Marlon Brando's reactions. The whole film depended on the viewer believing that Niven could get away with the confidence trickery. And, of course, he could, just as Brando as the brash American, was the perfect foil. In the 1988 travesty, the viewer could never believe in Michael Caine being an aristocrat. A barrow boy, yes; a gangster; yes - but a smooth confidence trickster, able to con his targets in the South of France - never. Sorry.I would give "Bedtime Story" 9 +I would give "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" zero -.Both titles are inept &amp; the former is confusing. I wonder whose idea it was?It was rather like renaming Les Valseuses ('Balls' in French argot) "Going Places".</fullReview>
