		<shortDescription>Not sure I like this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am one of the original Jason Statham fans. I loved the Transporter, Crank and his collaborations with Guy Ritchie like Revolver and even tolerated some of his less glorious efforts such as Death Race.For me what makes his movies so enjoyable is the tongue in cheek humour and the likable side of the tough guy. We all know he's not a great actor but the lovable rogue is his trademark and that's why we keep going back for more."The Mechanic" is about a ruthless hit man and it gives Statham no opportunity to smile or engage in banter, nor make us laugh. It's a non- stop action film with a few goofs and a script with holes big enough to drive a bus through. Normally I would forgive and forget, because I like him, but he didn't make me laugh nor make me wish I could be like him this time. There were no characters to like in this film, but there was plenty of action which makes it instantly forgettable. I know you want to read the movie was great but I wouldn't be honest if I pretended it was. Worth watching but don't expect another Transporter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An all around entertaining action-thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am in no way familiar with the original Charles Bronson film The Mechanic from 1972, but that may have actually been a benefit with a film like this. This remake does seem to be targeted toward my demographic though. The Mechanic caters to those who enjoy hard-hitting action films with a lot of blood that spews more vulgarities than you care to keep track of with a fair chance of nudity along the way. Truth be told, if done right those types of films can be massively entertaining and The Mechanic definitely falls into the "done right" category.Jason Statham really seems to be hit or miss when it comes to how entertaining his films are and lately his work just hasn't been all that satisfying. The Expendables left a really sour taste in my mouth, so I wasn't sure how The Mechanic would turn out. However, this film was actually able to put Statham back in top form since it was able to deliver a pretty great story to compliment Statham's bone crunching fight sequences he's become notorious for. Despite the fact that the dialogue is filled with F-bombs left and right, it fit the overall tone of the film very well. Ben Foster wasn't disappointing either. Foster is one of those incredible talents in his early thirties that most people seem to overlook as having endless potential. As far as his performance in The Mechanic, it isn't quite as powerful as he was in The Messenger but seems to be more similar to his role in Hostage yet refined a bit to leave his true motives questionable.Donald Sutherland also makes the most of his short time on screen. He has two scenes with Jason Statham where he makes two fairly long speeches that seem to stick with you long after his character is gone. That's how short-lived characters in films like this should be; memorable.The one thing the film falls victim to is the shaky camera during fight and chase scenes. It works most of the time and isn't hard to follow, but there were two scenes involving Jason Statham's character where it was hard to distinguish everything that was being shown because of this technique. It's just when two guys are in a scuffle and they're throwing fists or hurling their legs at their opponent, the camera whipping back and forth at the same time doesn't really help matters. Now some guy's dead, another falls to the ground after we hear a snap, and another is clutching his stomach even though we only saw the main character move twice. The technique gets confusing and either needs to be modified somehow or dropped altogether for something new.The Mechanic is actually really entertaining and is very much the definition of a guy film. It's packed to the brim with explosions, bloody headshots, broken limbs, and even a hefty and destructive car chase sequence. The film is worth seeing for Ben Foster's performance, but it's nice to see Jason Statham in a film that isn't disappointing for once. Overall, The Mechanic is dark, gritty, bloody, and just a hell of a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Enough For a Late Night Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing a late night showing of The Mechanic. After having a long week, this film did exactly what I wanted it to do...entertain me. Was the plot original? No. Was the acting amazing? No. But... Was the action good? Yes. Was Jason Stathham in it? Yes. Can you ask for anything else in an action film these days? It didn't label itself as a milestone of cinematic achievement. It was marketed as an action film, with good death scenes, mildly intriguing characters, and a simple plot and it delivered exactly on cue. Go see this if you just want to see some good action stars kick-butt for a couple of hours. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spectacular, hardboiled, and sometimes vicious action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A typical Statham movie, like the Transporter but with a higher dose of brutality and nastiness. Statham's character Arthur Bishop, a.k.a the Mechanic, is awesomely tough and cold-blooded, and the assassination plans and escapes are brilliant. But images like that of an old man getting shot in the chest (near the beginning) are hard to shake. Ben Foster is great as the jaded alcoholic who becomes the apprentice assassin. It's not clear where he learnt to take on a 350 pound killer with his bare hands, but like he says, "I've seen some s***." All the men in black suits and SUVs who try to protect their clients are equally impressive, and ineffectual. What use are dark glasses and handguns against killers who can climb buildings? Bishop has his hideaway out on the Bayou where he enjoys the finer things in life, like playing the soft classical music that soothes him after a killing, and rebuilding his Jaguar. (And his idea of rebuilding involves micrometres as much as wrenches.) He's got an arrangement with a woman that involves quick visits and wads of cash left on the table. His friend Harry tells him that he (Bishop) needs companionship, but the movie makes it pretty plain why his friendships don't last long. After the intense action sequences you may be saying cool, but does this guy have a soul? If so, it's well hidden under Statham's half-shaved, snarled-lip mug.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some things may not make sense and the storytelling may feel extremely fast paced, but you know what, in those moments where 'The Mechanic' promised to entertain you, it does it at its best. And don't get me wrong, cause I'm not a Statham's fan. I didn't like 'The transporter' cause the acting (especially the bad guy) was way too unreal. I didn't like 'Crank' either cause the directing was really bad. 'The Mechanic' is not a movie focused on the story but on the action, and that's where it shines. The action scenes are really sublime and they don't stop until the last minute. Actors also fit in an interesting story. Again, the director chose not to develop the story but to give an explosive experience, and I believe he achieved it. Don't look for a deep experience here and you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could you possibly make less sense?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand the suspension of disbelief. I understand watching only for "entertainment" but even within these realms this movie makes absolutely no sense. The lead character is the heartless solitary killer for hire working for the nondescript assassins r us. Then out of nowhere a guy shows up and tells him his best and only friend, his freaking mentor betrayed the company causing the death of some fellow assassins. Almost without question he promptly kills him... why? he betrayed the company, so... some other assassins got killed that he either didn't know or did not like, and what does he do? He shoots his friend. He doesn't help him or warn him or even ask him if it's true, (yes he falls or the oldest hit man ploy in the book) he shoots him because if he doesn't do it someone else will, stupid.Then the heartless cold blooded assassin feels some sort of guilt and takes his dead friend's son under his wing and in less than two weeks trains him to be a super assassin taking out other trained killers with no sweat, right.Eventually our hero figures out what every single person watching knew from the beginning, he was set up. He then proceeds to hunt down and kill everyone involved even his best friends son. Yep that's right he drags this innocent kid into the situation, he doesn't need the kids help for any of it nor does he makes any attempt to explain anything to him he just goes to very elaborate lengths to plan the kid's death.The end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1. For a movie that tries to make you root for Steve, the killings... oh dear. West was clearly going for shock value, but I somehow felt sorry for the people being killed. So depressing and grotesque.2. The pair go around and into other's places, and they don't wear gloves, leave plenty of fingerprints, and yet they aren't once suspected of murder.3. Honestly, if Bishop knew that he'd get into pickle with his boss, why did he even bother with Steve at all. A good assassin would be professional and not go out of his way to train some drunkard douche and kill him later.4. What was the point of the O'hare bus fight??? I know Bishop wanted him out of the way quick, but why bother putting his work aside for the sake of killing some random guy?? 5. On that note, how did no one notice a fight on a bus, but just a guy getting hit with a car after being tossed out a window? 6. The ending. Steve is like 20 KM from the gas station and this is a wireless detonator. How is that even possible????? There HAS to be some distance limit. That was such bullcrap.7. The acting is terrible. Statham, an actor I usually love, was limited to 2 emotions (if you can call them that): 1. "Don't bother me, I'm trying to figure out who this target is" and 2. "Don't bother me, I'm trying to make sure the job is done correctly" Ben Foster mumbles his way through the film, I literally could not understand WTF he was saying. You thought Ray Winstone's mumbling in Edge of Darkness was bad? Ben is FAR worse. His lines needed English subtitles.8. Better than 80% of the film was reaction shots with no dialog, of people standing around looking shocked. The rest of the film is jargon-filled exposition heavy dialogue and about 5 minutes of actual action.9. LAZY ACTION SCENES. I'm tired of going to action films and getting sick because the director has a problem with people being able to see what's going on. Shaky camera and quick cutting must die, I'm tired of it. 10. When I walked out, I felt depressed and sick, like I just ran 4 miles and ran face first into a brick wall. I was excited, but this was just bleak, boring and lame, and I am a Jason Statham fan.I have not seen the original, and I must say I CERTAINLY don't plan on it any time soon. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admire Jason Statham, I really do. He's managed to transform being a bald, vaguely threatening Englishman into movie fame and fortune (see: Transporter series, Crank series, etc.). He's found his niche, and he's sticking with it; more power to him.But this movie is pretty bad. I saw another reviewer describe this movie as a thriller. It is not. Nothing happens in this movie that you can't see coming a mile away. Here's the Reader's Digest condensed version which CONTAINS SPOILERS. Jason Statham is a badass professional murderer-- Sorry, hit-man-- who likes to kill his targets in ways that look like accidents, which is kinda clever. He works for "the company", which is never named, so I'm going to call it Evil, Incorporated. Evil, Inc is run by two guys: The soft spoken, wheelchair bound older guy who's been Statham's character's friend since forever. The other guy has a corporate haircut, wears an expensive suit and rides around in a convoy of sleek black vehicles, accompanied by sunglasses-wearing men with guns. Anyway, Corporate Guy tells Statham that his old friend is In League With The Enemy, and Statham kills his old pal at Corporate Guy's behest. The Old Pal's drunken loser kid shows up and asks Statham to train him up so he can find and kill the man who killed his dad. Statham agrees, because I guess a washed up, vengeance crazed drunk is the guy you want along when speed, silence, and skill are your keys to survival. Cue training montage.Statham finds out that Corporate Guy is SPOILERS AHEAD the real villain (bet you didn't see that coming). They set out to kill him, Drunk Loser Kid finds out Statham killed his dad, they kill Corporate Guy, Loser Kid tries to kill Statham, but Statham gets away and kills him instead. Roll credits.In addition to the cookie cutter plot, there were a few other things that annoyed me. 1) Statham's character is utterly unsympathetic. He's a loner who kills people for money. His only female companionship is a hooker. 2) He's supposed to live in the bayou area near New Orleans. His house has glass walls. Never mind that his work depends on secrecy; that's a hurricane zone. 3) I know this is small, but anyway: during the training scene, we see Statham and Drunk Kid shooting various guns. In one show motion cut, someone fires a Barret-type .50 caliber rifle, and the spent casing gets ejected toward the camera. The casing is crimped on the projectile end-- It's a freaking BLANK. Seriously, guys? Wait for the DVD and watch it with pizza and easily amused friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheesy acting abounds.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a hit-man has its challenges. Like murdering people for money and then not trying to think about it. After all, hit-man ARE human too and have feelings, just like the rest of us who work at more mundane jobs. The problem with this movie is that the story is so weak that not even the nonstop violence is enough to prop it up. Gratuitous scenes of violence is a telltale sign that a movie is in trouble and this movie is in deep trouble. Besides offering the thinnest of stories, the movie contains what has to be some of the cheesiest acting in recent cinematic history. The movie borders on being campy yet fails to attain that dubious status since it's really not goofy enough to be taken with a grain of salt. In short, the story is stale but without being laughable. The characters are two-dimensional, cartoon-like, and are devoid of anything that sparks even the slightest bit of interest. The violence is pervasive and explicit, but when the targets themselves are vicious, the violence fails to generate any sympathy. A hit-man plotting to assassinate another hit-man just does not make for a dramatic story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular film plenty of frantic action , thrills , intrigue and lots of violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake from classic film directed by Michael Winner (1972) and starred by Charles Bronson with screenplay by Lewis John Carlino . Thrilling movie about the very deadly rivalry between two contact killers . Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham in similar role to Charles Bronson) is a very professional hit man , he is the number one killing people with a bullet whose reputation has caught up with him. Bishop makes his missions of the way more mechanic and perfect, for that reason he is known as ¨The mechanic¨. Lone Bishop only has one friend named Harry (Donald Sutherland in the Keenan Wynn character) . His last assignment for a powerful organization (led by Tony Goldwyn) results to be the killing an important business man . Stressed and tired he plans to get out after one of his last jobs. He always works alone but he takes an apprentice named Steve McKenna (Ben Foster , role formerly played by Jan-Michael Vincent) who learns the criminal lessons from his master , both have innumerable ways to murder. At the beginning the protégé follows the advices given by his master murderous . Both of whom form a relentless killer team but Bishop is caught in the middle of treason. As hot-headed Steve McKenna want to off Bronson and attempts to assume the position of top hit-man.This crime thriller packs intrigue, suspense, noisy action-packed with grisly killings ,explosive excitement, thrills and lots of violence and sex . This moving film is as calculating , cold and passionless as its central characters , two brutal hired assassins . Jason Statham with his usual hard acting displays efficiently his weapons and killing mercilessly his objectives . It's certainly thrilling , though the morality may be questionable , even in this time, as the spectators were clearly on the Statham's side in spite of being a cruel killer . Statham as a wealthy murderer for a powerful organization offers the sort of strong acting as always. Furthermore, appears a nice secondary cast as Donald Sutherland , Tony Goldwyn and brief performance of the gorgeous fashion model Mini Anden as Bishop's love interest, but the romance isn't what this movie offers , it is about action and violence and director knows his work . It packs stirring musical score composed, orchestrated and performed by Mark Isham . Colorful cinematography by Eric Schmidt with spectacular scenes filmed at New Orleans . This big hit motion picture is professionally directed by Simon West though with no originality . The director Simon West's well-oiled techniques generate some explosive entertainment and excitement as usual . This is an acceptable film about a deadly rivalry among two hired killers that will appeal to Jason Statham fans and action lovers .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and Full of Action!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mechanic which is a remake based off the same name is actually a really fun movie despite it being mostly run-of-the-mill. We have seen this movie many times before but this kind of action never grows old(if done right)no matter who the star is. I had a really good time watching violent action, some blood, and Jason Statham being Jason Statham.This film is about a hit-man who teams up with a vengeance-happy troubled dude and they do what they do best: kill people. This time, the hit-man, Arthur feels there are actually people who deserve to meet that fate.Well, I cannot say much about Jason Statham except he pleases me by being his normal self, racking up the body count. Ben Foster really stole the show though. He is adept at playing they guy who really doesn't give a hoot about anything but being very violent.Overall, this is a really fun, action-filled movie. Obviously, this film isn't the perfect action movie as there are ones better than this, but I can deal with a hour and a half filled with crazy action. I haven't seen the original though but now I may want to. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Your basic Jason Statham Action Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never seen the 1972 original of the same name starring Charles Bronson. Actually, I don't think I've ever seen a Charles Bronson movie in it's entirety. That's not hard to believe since I was basically raised on comedy and horror films -- action films just never found their way into my late night film festivals. That being said, I enjoyed this new "mechanic".Arthur Bishop (Statham) is a professional hit-man. Since we can't call them hit men, we call them "mechanics", because they fix problems and stuff. Steve McKenna (Foster) wants to become a mechanic and asks Arthur to help train him because he knows his father (Sutherland). Only, Steve seems to be in it for all the wrong reasons -- for him, it's all about revenge.There is nothing really original or new to this story. It's an action movie, folks -- there's plenty of bullets, blood, slaps and kicks. The story's not that confusing, it's pretty easy to follow -- I wanted to say more about Statham, Foster and Sutherland -- but I can't because then that would give away everything in the entire movie. It easily held my attention throughout and watching guys like Statham fight is just plain cool. It chugged along just like any action movie should and resolved all the story lines along the way.If I could change anything about the movie, it would probably involve a little bit more mystery and intrigue -- there just wasn't enough of it in the movie. Well, that and more Mini Anden (rawr!). More reviews at www.soveryterry.com Final Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people know Jason Statham movies involve high octane action with brilliant fight sequences, you will be happy to know that this film delivers this well, however I believe that a movie with no decent storyline or good characters has no reason being made, even if the action is good. Some of the specifics of the film are ridiculous and some are cliché. Nothing in the story is fresh or original, if you have a good idea of what Jason Statham says or does in his action movies he probably will say and do them in this one, you won't be surprised a lot in this film, one surprise element may pop up but it definitely isn't enough. If you enjoy action movies regardless of the storyline or how the characters came to be then this is the film for you. If however like me you rely heavily on first story then second action this will be unsatisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this DVD in the used DVD rack, I didn't realize that, even though it had the same name, it really is a poor remake of the Charles Bronson, Jan Michael Vincent classic. (Hollywood, could you possibly find an original thought in your collective heads?) Oh, the cinematography and shot designs are modern, and Statham delivers a solid performance, but Foster as Steve McKenna NEVER convinced me he harbored an inner psychotic or had any real desire to be a hit man. In fact, his performance is more sophomoric than it is moody.In the original (1972), Bronson's brooding loner and Vincent's devil-may-care swagger make the story believable, and, ultimately, much more disturbing.Don't watch remakes...for the most part, they get made because a studio "suit" dusted off the earnings spreadsheet for the original and decided that the well could be tapped again for more dough. And, most of the time, they suck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>..And Bronson Lives Through !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think that the movie's title refers to the American underworld slang term for a professional hired killer, only. It says a lot about the movie's title character also; who looks mechanical himself, as a machine more than a man. This type of character is always about one sullen, senseless, and too fierce dude; which is a trend since the 1970s, that began with people like Charles Bronson, then got rejuvenated with more metallic leads ever since.Though, the worst news is that the movie's star Jason Statham was doing his job like a real machine, as he did with most of his characters to date (which's something Bronson, along with the "more metallic leads" who followed him, mostly did it too !). Sure Ben Foster stole the show; he was more charismatic and intense, or ? to be accurate ? more human in comparison. The story is about many killings, double-crossings, gunfights, and explosions. And it's well executed. Director Simon West for action is what young Sophia Loren was for sex. When it comes to perfectly hot image; he's one of the best. I follow him diligently since his first movie (Con Air), and rarely when a movie for him disappoints me. This round, he pulled off cool action sequences, with a certain love for the explosions, which were all portrayed sparklingly (Foster's death, in that 1968 car, was more of a tableau than another shot), and l loved the long jump out of the high building. He made the assured fiery and neat action which he accustomed to deliver. Like a pungent dish yet lovely. So what could be the problems ? Besides Statham's inanimateness, and Foster's character's sudden transforming into a professional hit-man and martial arts master, some images were horrible I had to close my eyes. But what disturbed me more was a pressing question : What could be the ethics of this movie ? Well, I believe it has no moral message, or message, at all. And that itself became a message I hate in the movies; especially when the lead is an immoral killer; who kills everybody to survive !Now to a strange matter. While the viewing I said to myself "It seems like a Charles Bronson movie", and had an association of ideas around the past 40 years, where the stony faced, crazily violent, lead ruled the action movies, and moralities haven't become so needed merchandise. And to my big surprise, I discovered later that IT IS an actual remake of a Bronson movie I haven't seen before, made with the same title in 1972. Hmmm, maybe not so strange after all !The Mechanic is a quick visit to a bloody dreamland, where you get out of the theater with no blood at all, just the fun of alternative world than yours. Simply, it's enjoyable waste of time. What didn't enjoy was the mechanical part; in the character and its actor. In fact, the continuation of that mechanical hero worries me about our contemporary world which used lately to produce this type and lovers for it !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violence for its own sake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are films where the story of necessity brings in violence.Then there are movies where the violence appears to be the raison d'?tre, and the plot merely a link between gory deaths. The Mechanic is such a film.The storyline here is pretty basic, is well covered in the IMDb synopsis and is predictable all the way through. The denouement could only be one of two endings, so the viewers' "enjoyment" (my quotes, deliberately) of this bloody, sadistic, effort is not enhanced by any plot twists or sub-plots.If all it took to make a great movie was the ability to destroy expensive motorcars in increasingly spectacular fireballs, there would be no shortage of Oscar material in the industry. But, quite frankly, once you've seen a couple, and admired the stuntwork and the efforts of the explosives experts, they leave you cold. And are therefore not a help but a hindrance to a good story.This film is nothing more than a parade of gratuitous, nasty, violence, stuck together with a linear, weak, plot. We see every killing - and there are sufficient to satisfy the most entrenched psychopath - in graphic and almost loving detail. The track hammers home the message, whatever that is.This movie aside, surely it is time for even the most liberal, let-it-all-hang-out psychiatric "expert" to see that this sort of thing must inevitably desensitise the viewer? I could no more go out and deliberately harm another person than fly - but after watching this sort of stuff for a couple of hours it's like water off a duck's back: it just doesn't impact me. It beggars belief that it has no effect on the small percentage of the population that are that way inclined in the first place.I am writing this just a few days after the Colorado cinema massacre, and I'm afraid that it surprises me not when film such as the Mechanic are seen as entertainment.(EDITED Dec 2012) I have happened upon my review (above) a week after the Newtown Sandy Hook school shooting: I reiterate the last paragraph.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jason Statham plays ice cool professional assassin, Arthur Bishop, in this testosterone-filled action thriller. His life becomes complicated when he is assigned to see off his close friend, Harry McKenna, played by Donald Sutherland who is excellent as Bishop's mean-speaking mentor.McKenna's son, Steve, played by Ben Foster, enters Bishop's world with aspirations to become a similarly effective killer. This adds to Bishop's headaches: the apprentice has a habit of scuppering carefully planned assassination attempts.Although the story does not spring any great surprises, it's beautifully shot, with action coming thick and fast through to the conclusion. Ben Foster plays the wayward rookie effectively - the violent gay fight scene had me wincing.Some excellent stunts and solid acting make this a very entertaining film within its genre: clearly aimed at a predominantly male audience, sat down with a beer, pizza, and looking for some serious action!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake that actually follows the original quite well!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You don't see enough accurate remakes of movies these days, and that's why I was particularly happy with this one.To start off on a different note, I've never quite enjoyed the on screen pleasure of Jason statham much. I'll let ya know that right up front as a guy who doesn't necessarily flock to the theatre every time I hear about one of his new films coming out. As well, I must confess, I've never seen the original (The Mechanic (1972)) either, but I have read a very detailed and accurate storyline/review of it, and it seems that based on the specific events that take place in each Mechanic film are quite accurate between one another. As well, it seems, from comparison, watching the remake, and knowing the stars of the original (the mechanic being Charles Bronson) that both sets of actors seem to fit the role quite well for this typical turn your mind off and watch stuff explode and plans go wrong action film. There is a few humorous moments as well. Kind of tongue in cheek, and dark humour combined, in both the original and remake of this film. Take a look if you like any of the contributing aspects this movie has to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My 374th Review: Sub-Stratham fare - with a huge implausibility factor....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rarely do spoilers but in this case the plot is so implausible I'm gonna have to - can someone just explain to me how the waster wastrel that is Ben Foster - who looks like the kid who gets sand kicked in his face at the best of times - turns within 10 minutes from a complete loser into a kick-ass assassin? That aside good to Statham in a leading role, he vindicates the choice with his usual taciturn hard-man turn, that though clichéd is perfect for this genre.The film is passable - the plot is pretty cheesy - but the action is good, but nothing on this planet would make me believe, vengeance, revenge, and anger included that Ben Foster's transformation is in any way feasible.Chalk this one up to action fun, but film? Hardly....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arthur Bishop is an artist at his craft; he can make any job seem like natural causes or an accident if necessary. He has learnt to stay detached.But when he is told to kill his friend, Harry, it's hard for him but he does it anyway. He makes it seem like a car jacking.Harry's son Steve so despondent over his father's death sets out to go after every carjacker he can find. But when he gets over his head, Arthur saves him.Arthur then decides to make Steve his apprentice. And while Steve is not as refined as Arthur, they continue with their collaboration....if you've seen the original, and know how great that film was, for one very good reason, you will disappointed with this one, as Hollywood has made it more endearing for action fans and franchise fans alike.But for what it is, it's not a bad film, just not very exciting to be fair. Statham is Statham and does very little apart from dust records and read on his laptop, very light on the action in this one he is.Foster is doing loose cannon role he has seem to have done in a few of his films since Alpha Dog, and while he is good, he soon starts to grate and you wish Statham would just b!tch slap him.There are a couple of good scenes, Fosters first whack on another mechanic is good, but is highly reminiscent of the Russian scene from the Punisher, and the first death is quite inventive too.But after it finished, i thought to my self, is that it? It had no real emotion to it, even when Arthur killed his friend, it reminded me of what Dr Evil said of losing Mini Me ' i'll be inconsolable...for about ten minutes'.Pointless stuff, but worth the one watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can Jason Statham suck?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple of the movies he was in sucked (War &amp; Expendables to name a couple) but his acting although a bit type-casted are on point for the roles he plays. This is an 8 out of 10 if you like Jason Statham movies. As for as story and character development it's more like a 6 out of 10. In other words, it's great to watch at least once so rent it or stream it definitely, but buying it for more than a $5 bargain price is pushing it. I myself got it in the mail via blockbuster on demand, but I think it may already be on Netflix or one of the movie channels already if not soon. It's definitely worth your time if you like action flicks since there are some pretty decent fight scenes and as always Jason's character is always cool and collected no matter what the obstacle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake, not bad, a simple tech upgrade in my view.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you haven't seen the 1972 version with Charles Bronson, don't bother, some films don't age well, like that one. So for the first time viewer of the story, expect to be treated to a fairly fun cat and mouse game between the mechanic Statham and a line up of characters wanting him disappeared.The parallels with the original are many; so for me, there were very little surprises. In both, the mechanic is a top pro because he is smart at anticipating danger and collected when action is required. I don't want to make comparisons for cultures 39 years apart, nor would I say Statham, Foster, and Sutherland are better than Bronson, Vincent and Wynn. For 2011, I'm satisfied with the cast we have and also the wisdom of Simon West, the director, to keep to the successful development and twisted outcome written in the original, negligibly upgrading for the remake effects wise. The original faired just slightly better ratings wise and I attribute that to the novelty. You get about the same duration, approximately 1? hour, of action drama for both. I liked it, but I don't feel that same urgency to go tell my friends to watch it, like I said in my review of "The Fighter" and my yet to be published review of the "Social Network". The ones who like Statham will watch the movie without any prompting from me. "The Bloke got fans".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing great, but an entertaining action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I already abandoned the hope of watching Jason Statham in a movie which does not include car chases, brutal body-to-body fights or apparatus explosions. That may be the only kind of job offered to him, or maybe Statham himself chooses to stay in the action genre because he likes it. Or he possibly knows the fact that the fame is transient and treacherous, so he does not reject any role fearing that it may be his last one. But, you know what? Whatever the reason it is, I am not bothered at all of seeing him over and over interpreting the tough guy with a good heart, challenging the adversity with guns or his fists, and making unlikely stunts by car. After all, his charisma and solid performances almost always benefit to those movies. What takes me to The Mechanic, the most recent film in which he has been involved, which is an entertaining but not very memorable action film.The Mechanic is a serious, violent and brutal action film, but not lacking of a sense of humor in its over-the-top action scenes and in Statham's performance, which is virtually identical to the one he brought in the films The One, The Transporter and its sequels, Revolver, Death Race, Crank and its sequel and The Expendables. But that does not matter, because it is exactly what The Mechanic required; besides, the chemistry he has with Ben Foster is pretty good, because their interaction simultaneously captures the potential of an incipient friendship and the distrust of sharing the most secret aspects from their life with a stranger. As for Foster's individual work, he brings another one of his realistic and passionate performances, showing the flexibility which allows him to work with the same credibility in art-house cinema (like The Messenger and Birds of America) and in action films (like this one and Pandorum). And despite his short stature, his physical development is equally competent.I also liked to see in The Mechanic some moments of solid drama and emotion (at least inside of what we can expect in a movie from this genre). So, in conclusion, I think that The Mechanic deserves a moderate recommendation, because despite not being very memorable and the screenplay being a bit predictable, I cannot deny that it made me have a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't wanna spoil anything, but this movie has the worst ending ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't have very high hopes for this movie, just went to watch a typical Statham's movie with lots of good action and violence. I didn't expect the story to be amazing, and every thing was going according to my expectation. I wasn't falling in love with the movie, but i wasn't hating it either. I was having a good time. And then the climax scene came. When it ended, I was left completely speechless. This movie has such a horrible ending that I felt angry with myself. The ending was very pointless, and it made the whole story extremely unnecessary. If you're looking for a movie with good action, and you don't care about the story at all, I would say watch this movie. But "The Mechanic" is Jason Statham's worst movie ever! PERIOD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie badly needs maintenance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well being a great Jason Statham fan we know that so far his action flicks has been able to deliver what an average audience usually expects. But this movie is an exception to me because of many reasons. i will not devote a great deal of time in writing a saga for this weak movie simply because it doesn't deserve my time and attention to such an extent. I will only say that story is not new so the characterization of every one involved in the making fails to deliver anything new. Also the script does let you down because there are not enough twists to keep the viewer engaged with the story. The most frustrating thing about the movie is that it wasted the talent of Jason Statham who has all the skills and charisma to pull the whole movie on his shoulders but a weak script and lack of under development of other characters doesn't let the movie to indulge the viewer. The climax also lets you down and the Director seems to be in a hurry of finishing the movie because he has ran out of all the trick to bring anything new out of ordinary script. The studio only made this movie in my opinion because they thought that A Jason Statham Movie Does Well because of his charisma which brings people to cinema halls so they gave green signal to this script and this generalization resulted in this average action flick without any positive outcomes.I just want to add that Jason should avoid these kind of scripts because it will only add flops to his career and that will be unfair to such a great action hero. In my view he should be the next JAMES BOND instead of Denial Craig. He has got all the elements in the right amount to play such character he should not waste his talent on such typical cinema.My overall rating is 4/10. A poor movie due to bad treatment of a poor script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>falls short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of the classic version from 1972 with Charles Bronson had some things right, but overall it really falls short of even competing with the original, let alone besting it.The 1982 film had a sort of detached coolness and a more visceral grittiness. These were professionals who did not get emotionally involved with the assignment. Jan-Michael Vincent's "Steve" wanted to prove he had what it took to be at, what he perceived, an elite level. Also there was a late 60s, early 70s counter-culture subtext to his motivation. And that was really interesting. Whereas the analog in this remake comes off more as a listless wanderer who has no clear idea what he wants to do, but he thinks it would be cool to kill people and he is emotionally overcome by the revenge aspect. Another fault I found was in the actual killings themselves. There was no detachment and precision. It was just raw death by torture in many cases. Sloppily fighting with the target, or shooting your way out of after a botched hit. Too much of the tired, formulaic "Hollywood modern action" was written and you lose all the nuance, the art of the kills which these mechanics would care about (even perhaps more than the monetary reward).Hollywood films these days tend to assume the average movie viewer is a moron, so they try to connect as many dots for us as possible. This is patronizing and downright offensive. The match up between the old and new Bishop illustrates this glaringly. Bronson's Bishop was about control, he was in supreme control and his downfall was letting his emotion hinder that control. Everything he did was calculated. And this was no brute, he was a cultured assassin. I felt that the writers tried to convey this with Statham's Bishop but it came across very hammy (the numerous shots of his record player) and forced. Also time and again in this remake we saw a Bishop that seemed to be driven by almost pure emotion, a reactive Bishop who was never in control except marginally in the opening hit. This remake emphasized over and over the revenge motif and I think it was a mistake having Bishop go after the Company. This was never even a possibility in the original film and I like that because it established a boundary that even Bishop had to recognize. It's the cheesy desire in Hollywood action films for the main character(s) to always get retributive justice by their own hands. I see this time and again these days and it gets very tiresome.This remake shows that a vastly bigger budget does not equate with better film making. Regarding pacing the remake seemed a bit too fast, however that wasn't surprising.I am torn regarding the ending. On one hand I like the fact that Bishop bested Steve and lived to see another day in this remake. However philosophically I must give a slight edge to the original film in which both of them die because the narrative is stark: in this business of death there is no clear winner. I think even the first film should have explored some of the moral issues a bit deeper and may even had a redemptive dynamic, but that would be clearly a different sort of film.So to sum up, this remake was enjoyable as a modern action film, but if you want a bit more depth and nuance see the original!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mechanic is of Chuck Norris proportions! Its has a ton of bloody violence and intense action sequences, many of which are unbelievable. With that said, Jason Statham is the English version of Chuck, minus the legendary pop culture status. Statham has been in many action flicks over the last few years many of which stink. For example, The Transporter trilogy and Crank plus its unfortunate sequel. Now if you like stupid, unintelligent situations, plot sequencing, and character invincibility these are the films for you. To me, a great action movie makes you want to be that hero. Most action movies these days don't possess that. The Mechanic isn't much different, although it is a decent movie. It is also a remake of the Charles Bronson classic by the same name released in 1972. I haven't seen the original so I have no comparison to make.The premise of the movie is action simple. Arthur Bishop (Statham) is a contract killer. He is employed by an unnamed organization led by Dean (Tony Goldwyn) and Bishops only friend and mentor Harry (Donald Sutherland). Naturally since Arthur is a killer he lacks the skills to make real human connections. So he has no real friends besides Harry and his favorite prostitute. One fine day in assassin land, Arthur receives the unfortunate task of killing a close associate. And soon there after Harry's estranged son Steve (Ben Foster) becomes Arthur's sidekick and assassin in training. Shenanigan's ensue!Strengths: The Mechanic is a pretty good action movie. It is better than most Statham films and more realistic than most movies he is in. The addition of Ben Foster to the cast is a plus as he is one of Hollywood's finer young actors. Think Ryan Gosling without the Oscar nomination. The movie is short and straight to the point. So where it lacks it makes up for with not wasting a lot of your time.Weaknesses: The primary weak spot for me was character likability. I did not connect with anyone in the movie. I won't say who lives or dies, but all the characters in one way or another deserve death for their disregard for human life. As the film goer you basically feel like an outsider watching a train wreck in a snow globe. While that is good sometimes, it would be nice to know that at least one character was not a total sociopathic jerk. That's not the case with The Mechanic. Another main weak area is believability. Yes, I know that I described it above as more believable than most recent action movies, especially from Statham, but it still exaggerates a great deal. I will leave it at that.Recommendations: This is basically a guy movie. Its bloody. Its violent. It has some nudity and the language is appropriate for a typical action film. It is not a kids movie, so parents attempt some common sense and leave the kids with a sitter. Its not even a good date movie. I did like it, but it is really only meant for a guys night out.For more movie reviews: www.ilfilmati.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A less than so-so remake of 70's movie with Charles Bronson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is based on forgotten , but good 70's movie with Charles Bronson ("Once upon a time in the west"). The story is pretty much the same. There are some changes made , so even if you seen the original you shouldn't be bored.The movie is quite well directed by Simon West ("Con air") . The action scenes are entertaining . Donald Sutherland ("Kelly's heroes") makes a short , but good performance. Unfortunately there are issues here that made me mad.I didn't liked the orange-black colour that dominates the movie. There is FAR too many coincidences in the screenplay. The movie tries hard to impress the audience with the violence. It's completely unnecessary. This "Mechanic" misses the point of the original movie which was a sad and bitter story about hit men. There is no depth here , only violence . This movie also changes the ending , which makes the story completely pointless. It doesn't end like an adult movie , more like some MTV trash for teenagers. Well , this IS Jason Statham movie , so what could you expect ?Better watch the original with Charles Bronson. It's a good and sad thriller/action movie. If you saw this one before the Bronson's original I still recommend you to see it . This one is nothing really special . I give it 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, with solid action scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mechanic is a good movie... solid plot, good action stunts, good editing. The story lacks complexity but has a driving energy and core emotional substrate, a through line of emotion that drives the film, that many films today lack. Action movies can be terrible or compelling; this one is solid and effective.Some reviewers miss the puns and quips from other Statham films.... I don't. I find elements like that distracting. And they wouldn't have belonged in this film.Some reviewers say the acting is wooden... I disagree. The script doesn't give Statham a lot of ground to cross emotionally, but Donald Sutherland comes through with an interesting, even touching performance. And Ben Foster has a volatile, unstable quality, straddling a weird but believable ground between vulnerable and borderline- psychopathic, that plays effectively off Statham's character's more guarded emotions. Some fault the film because they're troubled by the scene in which - SPOILER WARNING - Statham's character shoots Sutherland in cold blood, at a juncture in the story when Sutherland has made himself vulnerable and defenseless. Again I can't agree that this is a fault. The scene IS troubling -- that's the point -- and is essential to Statham's motivation in taking Foster's character under his wing. If you can't get it out of your mind, neither can the lead character. His guilt over it is the obvious (and only conceivable) explanation for slowing himself down by taking on a sometimes-inept protégé. Some fault the movie because they feel sorry for the assassins' victims; but that's also a strength, not a weakness. If anything, the movie would be stronger if there hadn't been a half-hearted attempt to justify the assassinations by painting the victims as being "bad".... as if their lack of redeeming moral qualities was what motivated the assassinations. If you see The Mechanic, see it on the DVD because the deleted scenes are worth watching. They add emotional complexity, add some depth to the story and characters, and actually, one of the best action scenes in the movie is among them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Statham and Foster deliver excellent performances. The action is gritty and compelling. In fact Foster starts to steal the spotlight in the badass department-- I'm excited to see more from him. The action itself is believable and immersive; unlike some action films it does not entirely depart from reality to tell the story. The ending was a real disappointment. When Statham walked away unscathed it cheated the promise of justice and undercut any credibility Statham's character had in terms of remorse and recompense. It made Foster's death petty and robbed the film of substantive meaning, dissolving it into just another action flick. It could have been more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Mechanic" is an action thriller film starring Jason Statham and Ben Foster. There are good action movies and bad action movies, but "The Mechanic" is an unnecessary action movie. Even though I am myself an action movie fan and I respect Jason Statham as an action hero, but nothing could deter from the fact that "The Mechanic" is a waste of time(88 minutes) and money(they didn't get enough profit). Cast wise, Good. Jason Statham is now the best action hero in Hollywood and hence his casting is natural.Ben Foster is good in his role as a trainee under the guidance of Statham. Besides that, others have hardly any role."The Mechanic" doesn't boost of good action neither enough thriller to bear the genre tag of "action thriller".All the actions are typical and nothing oomph factor in them. It seems as though everyone in the movie production team had virtually no prep going into the movie. They just had to make a movie and they made the movie.Overall, "The Mechanic" is not boring(due short running time). But it doesn't even deserve a single view from audience. It's a bad choice by Jason Statham.My Verdict: 5/10</fullReview>

So much had been kept from the original that I thought that this could possibly be a good remake for todays moviegoers. As it turns out, the story was identical to the original but, unlike Mr Charles Bronson, Jason Statham obviously had a problem with playing a character that dies. What a mistake. By changing the ending, they changed the entire feel of the movie. It's not meant to end well for Statham's character, or anyone else for that matter. He is meant to die, like everybody else dies in the movie. If anyone had to live, it should have been Foster's character. All in all I give the movie a 6/10 and would urge you to watch the original, it's so much better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charles Bronson did it better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there had never been an original version of The Mechanic I would have liked this movie a lot better. I still enjoyed it basically and recommend it to action film fans, but the original is still the best. It reminded me of when they remade The Manchurian Candidate several years ago. Don't filmmakers know that you can't outdo perfection and lightning doesn't strike twice in the same place. Except for Death Wish and The Dirty Dozen, The Mechanic was my favorite Bronson film. He held it together with his cool intensity and no one could have done it better and no one should have tried. Jason Statham and Ben Foster do competent jobs in filling Bronson's and Jan Michael Vincent's shoes (in fact Foster is even more snottier then Vincents Steve McKenna was). If I could have a word with director Simon West it would be this. Sir, putting more vulgar language and bloodier violence doesn't make a better film. In 1972, movie makers weren't allowed to show the graphic violence they do today and that made for a much better film. It was almost like West went out of his way to be as bloody and graphic as possible. There is also a vicious element to the violence in this film, I hated that scene where Bishop not only terrorized the man who betrayed him but also his wife and daughter as well. He stuck the daughter's hand in a garbage disposal. This movie is a good action thriller, but my advice to you is to go to a video store and rent the original. You will have a better time at a much cheaper price.</fullReview>

It wasn't fantastically clever, but if you like action films, this does the job. Donald Sutherland was a nice presence in the film, too. Wish they used more of him.I would have rated the film higher than six stars but for the fact that IMO it was a bit slow in places. Less dialogue/set-up and more action, please. And more of Statham doing it. That said, when the action does arrive, it is good, solid action. More action scenes, and closer together, would have been better.Ben Foster's character has some interesting sequences; however, I question the idea that Statham's character would have put so much trust in him.All in all, it is a well-enough wrought piece of work, but doesn't rise to the same riveting level of interest as the Transporter series.</fullReview>

All though it had many flaws it wasn't a terrible movie, but not "Ok" movie either! In the movie so many thing's got sloppy, and so are the killings. And in the movie there is this intense van/bus scene were the cars and a bus crash into each other...And you don't even here a single cop siren! This is a typical "Jason Statham" movie, were the action is corny and the writing isn't great at all! This movie is a waste of money!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is called " The Mechanic ' originally written by Lewis J. Carlino. With this addition, there are now three versions. The original starred the late Charles Bronson, with Jan Michael Vincent as his protégé. The second was with Nicolas cage(Bangkok Dangerous) and this is the third. This version stars Jason Statham as Arthur Bishop. Of all the possible actors who could adequately fill the shoes of Bronson, it's Statham. His movie exploits have made him synonymous with action flicks. With Simon West directing, it not only follows the original story but with this version multiplies the drama, exciting action of the first, but remains true to the characters. Keenen Wynn is replaced by none other than Donald Sutherland who brings an air of sophistication and sympathy to his role. Ben Foster plays the young upstart Steve McKenna, who seems not only innocuous, but hardly suitable to replace Vincent. Tony Goldwyn is Dean, who was originally played by Frank De Kova. Throughout the entire movie, audience members are treated to an interesting story and one which is likely to become a memorable follow up to the original Classic. The conclusion here is that with the right people, this version too will likely become a Classic. Easilly recommended. Superb rendition! ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice movie great action but spoiled by so many errors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie and story was nice and would be great experience, but the experience was corrupted by so many ERRORS in the movie: at least 6 times i've seen crew microphone, cameraman in the shiny mirrored areas. Boat catching in the beginning is clearly not natural. Also when Bishop jumps down the bridge, the boat is not in the place when he dropped the water (before the jump the boat is more further than after the drop). Clearly dummy ammo meanwhile slow motion of shooting... Obviously more penetrated bag handle into ceiling in one moment during the fight. Not mentioned about the other mistakes in the movie... I really can't believe that they've released so bad movie cut! Whole movie was for me nothing just laughing about the mistakes they left... :-(</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better action over tension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main reason I wanted to see this remake is because I liked the unique ending in the 1972 version, so I wanted to know how it's going to be in this version. Some elements of this 2011 "The Mechanic" I liked more than 1972 version, especially since this version has more hits. The reason why the hit-man gets a apprentice sort of makes sense this time around compared to the original, since the bond between the hit-man Arthur Bishop and Harry McKenna at least has a reason although very slight. Some character motivations and scenarios has been changed but I personally liked Charles Bronson's portrayal of the character, it was more cold blooded and intimidating. And for a hit-man this makes sense, in this version it tries to make the hit-man likable to the mass audience by giving him compassion. There is some recognizable plot holes and mistakes in this movie, so it's best to just throw realism out for this one. And for a movie like this, it doesn't really make a difference. The 1972 version has more tension, but this has better action and flare to it. But since tension is more difficult direction I am going to give credit to the 1972 version a bit more.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mechanic reeks of unoriginality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mechanic reeks of unoriginality. And I'm not talking about the fact it's a remake of a Charles Bronson flick from 1972. It's the stale screenplay by Richard Wenk and Lewis John Carlino, and the uninspired approach from director Simon West (Con Air, Tomb Raider) that had me feeling like I had already seen The Mechanic numerous times before. The set-pieces are sporadically enjoyable, granted, but everything else surrounding those fleetingly good moments are dripping in dullness. The plot is predictable, the characters are one dimensional and the violence ? although gory ? is hardly entertaining. Even the soundtrack is strangely boring.Since his double whammy debut of Lock, Stock and Snatch Jason Statham has churned out cookie-cutter action flicks like they're going out of fashion. He's starred in everything from the good ? Crank, The Italian Job, Death Race ? to the bad ? The Expendables, the Transporter trilogy, Cellular ? to the ugly ? Ghosts of Mars, In the Name of the King. Perhaps he's worried one day he'll be out of the job; a likely outcome if he insists on starring in underwhelming vehicles such as this. The Stath needs to take a few risks and steer away from the calm, cool and collected bad-ass that he's apparently so comfortable playing.He's given capable support in the way of Ben Foster, a young actor who hasn't wholly delivered on the promise he showed a few years ago. Foster proved with his remarkable performance in 3:10 to Yuma that he can do the eerie, menacing type, complete with charisma and flair, however here his quiet craziness lacks the same gravitas. Elsewhere, old timer Sutherland is completely redundant and Goldwyn is neither threatening nor humorous as the wimpy, boring bad guy. To be honest, the cast aren't given much to work with past clichéd characters and stilted dialogue, but then why in the name of decent film selection did they sign on for this? There's nothing on offer here that you haven't already seen throughout Statham's career.2 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Average, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tolerable Remake That Not Even Statham Can Redeem!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anybody who saw British director Michael Winner's top-notch 1972 white-knuckled, killer-thriller "The Mechanic" with Charles Bronson cast as a stoic, steely-eyed assassin who makes murder look like an accident knows no remake could ever do it justice. Mind you, tough-guy Jason Statham makes "Con-Air" director Simon West's rehash of this classic action epic tolerable. Statham possesses an iconic presence that filmmakers have been grooming since he made his debut in writer &amp; director Guy Ritchie's outstanding crime opus "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" in 1998. French producer Luc Besson catapulted the actor to widespread prominence with the larger-than-life "The Transporter" franchise. Meantime, if the best action movies must top each other, then "The Mechanic" has Statham running in place. Although it occurs in a believable physical environment, "The Mechanic" is just too conventional to be more than average. You don't see Statham perform any stunts here that he hasn't done far better in either his "Transporter" trilogy or his outlandish "Crank" movies. Credit Simon West for maintaining the momentum throughout this contemporary actioneer and staging each scene with a classy look. Nevertheless, the surprises, complications, and villains induce yawns more often than alarms. As R-rated thrillers go, "The Mechanic" seems incredibly subdued compared with genuine R-rated exercises in blood, gore and murder like the recent crime epic "The Punisher." "16 Blocks" scenarist Richard Wenk has changed substantially the content and context of the original in his update. Lewis John Carlino, who penned the original, shares screen credit with Wenk, but it is difficult to determine if more than the Carlino basics were retained. A straightforward, scene-for-scene rehash of the original "Mechanic" would have been less-than-inspired but more than adequate. Apparently, West and Wenk wanted to improve on the original and thus dispense with everything that made it so unforgettable. Unlike the tragic 1972 ending, the "Mechanic" remake boasts an upbeat ending so that a sequel could ensue. Furthermore, this revenge melodrama provides more deception that makes our hero appear somewhat stupid when you think about it because the villains take advantage of him in a way that would never have occurred in the Bronson classic. Moreover, unlike Bronson and co-star Jan-Michael Vincent, Statham and Ben Foster kindle little charisma as mentor and apprentice.Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham of "The Expendables") is a reclusive killer who performs hits for a mysterious corporation. He is the best in the business, and the first scene demonstrates his expertise. Bishop penetrates the premises of a Colombian drug lord. Scores of heavily armed brutes patrol the place. Nevertheless, our protagonist kills the drug lord right under their collective noses. Moreover, Bishop makes it appear as if drug lord drowned. This is probably as slick as "The Mechanic" remake gets, and our anti-heroic hero makes good his escape by swimming away under the dead drug dealer. The guards think nothing unusual as they watch their wiry boss perform a slow crawl across the pool. The next thing they know is their boss has curled up dead in the water. They sound the alarm, but Bishop is far away. Bishop meets his mentor, Harry McKenna (Donald Sutherland of "The Eagle Has Landed"), who cruises around in a wheelchair. Harry brings Bishop a package of greenbacks as payment. Bishop and harry have a history, and Harry is the closest to a friend that Arthur has. When Arthur isn't knocking off people, he listens to vinyl Schubert recordings on a turntable, tinkers with his fashionable Jaguar, and checks his e-mail on his Apple. Occasionally, he goes out for a drink and enjoys the company of a highly-paid prostitute. Incidentally, Arthur lives in a sumptuous residence in a remote bayou outside of New Orleans. Life for Arthur, as far as everything goes, couldn't be better until he learns that Harry has been selling out his colleagues to the tune of $50 million. Harry's partner, Dean (Tony Goldwyn of "Ghost"), contacts Arthur and shows him a sheaf of gory photos.Naturally, Arthur has to think about this contract. A life-long friend, Harry has been there for him. Harry loves Arthur like a son. Harry has a son, Steve (Ben Foster of "3:10 to Yuma"), but he hates him. Anyway, Arthur decides to ice Harry, if for no other reason than Harry will suffer less. Ingeniously, Arthur makes Harry's death look like a carjacking. Eventually, Steve drifts into the picture, and revenge dominates his thinking. Arthur intervenes to keep Steve from killing an innocent criminal and decides to train Steve as an assassin. Dean doesn't think that this is one of Arthur's better ideas. Arthur teaches Steve the rules of killing, but Steve isn't as cautious and careful. Rather than kill a child molesting thug without fanfare, Steve decides to beat the man to death. Steve survives, but he looks like he ran into a bulldozer. As Steve learns more and more, he moves in with Arthur. One day Steve discovers his father's nickel-plated automatic pistol in Arthur's storage tubs and plots his mentor's demise. Before he can carry out the hit, Arthur and he must leave for Chicago to murder a religious cult figure with a controversial background. Indeed, nothing goes right for them, and they escape by the skin of their teeth.Director Simon West doesn't rely on high tech gadgetry. He keeps most of violence pretty down to earth. The shoot-out scenes are staged without excessive blood and gore, and West lets nothing get in the fairly straight-forward storyline. West and Wenk do insert an occasional surprise. The best concerns cramming a teenage girl's fingers down a garbage disposal in a sink. Not surprisingly, Arthur Bishop comes off looking immaculate compared with his murderous colleagues as well as his wicked victims. The Charles Bronson character in the original worked for the Italian mafia. Altogether, "The Mechanic" is primarily a nuts and bolts melodrama with little to distinguish it outside Jason Statham's tight-lipped performance and Ben Foster's maniacal energy as a wannabe killer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Crass American equivalent to Corbijn's European The American (ooh the irony)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creators: Directed by Simon West, director of the legendary Con Air (didn't know this before viewing; no wonder I was so pleasantly surprised) Story and Screenplay by Lewis John Carlino, writer of the 1972 version (Ignorantly, I had previously no idea of this original's existence). Richard Wenk (16 Blocks) also contributing to the screenplayWhat Happened: Plain and simple action/hit-man genre film. Jason Statham's Arthur Bishop takes under his wing Steve McKenna (Ben Foster), the son of his old friend/mentor Harry McKenna (Donald Sutherland) - who also happens to be his last hit. Bishop tries to bring him up to his regimented standard, but the youthful, unruly McKenna has his own eccentric style. Plenty of over-masculine shenanigans and brutal deaths ensue.Theme/Message: As a non-ironic display of machismo it is important to concede that most of the point of this film existing is for the spectacle of things blowing up, brains blowing out and screwdrivers rammed through faces. Reading past this a little, I thought that there was a thinly veiled idea that both ends of a spectrum are not healthy. There seemed to be an effort to promote the balance between the overly formulaic control freak (Bishop) and the chaotic, out of control degenerate (McKenna), but this theory didn't hold up toward the end. I don't know if having one of the most physically intimidating and brutish displays of might come from a gay hit-man was some way of counteracting its unapologetic masculinity or not, but it was something to note.What it did particularly well: The brutality really was entertaining. I was expecting Transporter levels of action, but that wasn't what the film was about. It was a little slower paced than that, but with the violence in the action sequences really ramped up and very graphic. The two leads were really crassly entertaining; never did the uber-machismo bother me, as it sometimes tends to (I'm looking at you Expendables). It was like a really unsophisticated version Corbijn's The American (complete with ridiculously attractive prostitute). In fact, considering The American was a very European film - itself an ironic concept - this was like an American version of The American - Irony overdrive. The film was paced really well too; both the action and the character development (yes it did have a little) were nicely spread throughout so that there were no lulls.What unimpressed or didn't quite reach potential: Certain plot holes that were a little unforgivable, e.g. when they explained that McKenna was able to make a connection with their next mark because this is his first job. Really, the son of one of the biggest names in hit-man organisation wouldn't ring any alarms to a professional doing some background checks?Performance of the film: Ben Foster was really something. Still has that slightly psychotic look in his eyes that he had back in Six Feet Under, but he really impresses as a competent and charismatic action star, with his own unique edge. (He was also my best performance of 30 Days of Night)Scene of the film: Steve McKenna blasting his way out of a pretty dire situation and thus convincing me of both the character's elite status in this film and of the young actor's potential to be a great action star (he can actually even act)Most outstanding or memorable feature: Brutality of the action.

		<fullReview>Jason Statham is one of my favourite actors and I'm gradually getting round to seeing all of his films. It's very rare that they disappoint, this one certainly didn't. Jason Statham is just superb as 'The Mechanic'. He just really suits these sort of film roles, he's a proper bad-ass. Ben Foster also put in a very good performance alongside Jason. The action is fast paced when it gets going and keeps you on the edge of your seat. It is filmed really well and the stunts/action scenes look really good. The plot is good and keeps you guessing with a few twists along the way. The film is pretty violent and there are a few scenes in particular that might make you wince a little.Overall a very enjoyable film. Just good solid action, definitely worth watching. 8/10.</fullReview>

The plot itself makes little sense and the reasoning behind just about everyone's actions is absurd. I remember watching the original Mechanic featuring Charles Bronson many years ago but I honestly can't remember the plot or circumstances of that film. I don't remember it being this lifeless, dark and dumb. Maybe I'll have to refresh my memory because it'll be interesting to compare the two movies but I can't imagine the original being this bad and not registering with me years ago. The sad thing is that I really like the cast here and was hoping to see them shine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mechanic repairs action genre: The Filmsmith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>thefilmsmith.com The iconic bald white guy John McClane is no longer allowed to say his catch phrase on screen, or shoot people who actually ooze blood. So it's good to see another bald white guy take up the action film banner in all its messiness.Jason Statham plays Arthur Bishop, a mechanic, who whacks guys with the skill to make them look like accidents. Things get dicey when his wheelchair-bound boss Harry McKenna (Donald Sutherland) is killed, and McKenna's vengeful son Steve (Ben Foster) comes looking for an education in the assassin business.From The Transporter to Crank, Jason Statham is a wrecking ball: you wheel him in to rock the house, but if you're looking for something more riveting between action feats (character development, acting, etc), you need a different tool. Which is where Ben Foster is useful. In the critical darling The Messenger or The Mechanic Foster vibrates with a centered zen that draws you in. Statham may have a menacing mug, but Foster, as the enigmatic Steve, upstages the action star at every turn.Neither actor benefits from Simon West's direction, since most action scenes are close enough to make out nose hairs, but none of the fisticuffs. Where Statham's physical virtuosity could be showcased, West forces us to be in the scuffle with nary a notion of what's going on. This film doctor prescribes some wide shots from a Jackie Chan film.Despite directorial issues, some action pieces escape mangling. Hand-to-hand combat is particularly brutal when small-statured Steve goes up against a 300 pound foe and his clever shots with a Glock 9mm make him an admirable badass.The brutality of these scenes is a change of pace since we've been raised by a decade of PG-13 cop films that avoid the F-Bomb or bits of blood that get a film slapped with an R rating (which equals lower box office receipts and restrictions on advertisements). Foster and Statham dispatch goons in such varied, messy ways you almost feels sorry for the hapless henchmen. The film's blood lust is as dark as its blood stains.MAJOR SPOILERS, SKIP PARAGRAPHS What's most disappointing about The Mechanic is that it looks to conclude with a poetic equilibrium, yet trades it in for a perfunctory ending that leaves an opening for a sequel.One of the plot twists to the film is that Arthur is told Harry McKenna crossed the company they both worked for. Arthur kills Harry (who tells Arthur, "I'm glad it was you,"); this leaves dangling tension between Arthur and Harry's son Steve. Once Steve knows Arthur killed his father, the two men stop at a gas station. At this point each of them knows the truth, but neither let on. Which makes it all the more meaningful when Arthur tells Steve, "I'm sorry about everything," in a vague unrelated way, possibly hinting that he knows what Steve is about to do.Steve walks away from the truck while pumping gas and shoots the gas tank, engulfing Arthur's truck in flames. He then goes back to Arthur's place. A sports car Arthur has been working on is now completed and Steve takes it for a spin. He sees a piece of paper in the passenger seat which tells him "If you're reading this, you're dead." Steve good-naturedly lols before being blown up.A nice, reciprocal, poetic ending for a couple of assassins.Until The film cuts to security camera footage of the truck explosion, which shows Arthur rolling away in a comical fast-forward ? rewind loop. We then cut to a close up of Arthur leaving the crime scene and driving away in a truck he just happened to have stationed nearby for just such a random occasion.There isn't anything inherently wrong with this ending ? it's just not as fresh as the one hinted at. Having Steve kill our lead guy went against tired action film tropes. The ideal ending would have had Steve drive away with Arthur's sports car (a changing of the guard) or even having them both kill each other, Steve's last words being laughter. That would have been something to talk about.But no. Kill the most interesting character and leave the block of wood, Statham, standing to live another day ? or star in another installment.MAJOR SPOILERS OVER Yes, I'm disappointed the film didn't follow through on its transcendent ending, but don't let that dissuade you from seeing this. The action sequences will making you think you've been transported to the 1990&#x2032;s (some digital blood, but otherwise tons of practical effects) and Ben Foster makes it capable of withstanding a second viewing. If you were disappointed by The Expendables, The Mechanic is a good mix of bullets and character to quench your action thirst.-Remington Smith</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Professional hit men at their best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Synopsis) Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) is the "mechanic," which actually means professional assassin for hire. Bishop is the best in the business of eliminating targets, and making it look like an accident, meticulously setting up every detail of the hit. The hit is perfect when no one knows that he was ever there. Bishop's mentor and friend Harry McKenna (Donald Sutherland) dies, and Bishop takes Harry's son Steve (Ben Foster) under his wing to teach him the business. Together, they are one force; you don't want to be within their gun sights! (My Comment) This is a story of professional killers in action, and in this movie you will get plenty of action sequences and explosions. Usually Bishop is detached from his assignment, but when he goes after the people responsible for Harry's death, all he wants is vengeance. Jason Statham's outstanding performance as the cool killing machine was right on target. Ben Foster's character of killing his target is a little more complicated than killing someone the easy way. There is a lot more brutality; however Steve pays the price for not following what Bishop taught him. In one scene where Bishop questions a body guard at his home to get his boss' address, he goes way over the top. Overall, I liked this action packed movie, but it is over before you know it.

		<shortDescription>This film is broken, no wonder they need a mechanic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake has managed to do what very few films have accomplished, it made me stop watching it. With no feelings I might miss something and perfect assurance I could have been doing something better than watching a rock video for serial killers. Instead of following the formula that worked in the past the producers and director, this time around decided that it had been missing graphic and brutal depictions of murder, so they fixed it. But ended up breaking something that didn't need fixing.If your thinking that I am just not into violent films, you would be wrong. Many films have brought the fictional representation of violence to the level of fine art. This is not one of them. In fact I had not it was a remake even. I did see the original though. I caught it late at night just as it started in 1983 on HBO.The film was riveting. I have often thought back to it through the years as a fine example of American action suspense film.Halfway through this Redux of fail, I began wondering why I was watching it at all. Then I caught a post from a young man reviewing it here, Which said( this film is so lame &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so on and so on.). But what got me was the end of his review. "The movie they based this on must suck to, I will never watch the original." That is pretty damn sad.I had different issues than the angry young man had with this film. Over all it is well made. I think the director lost his mind and forgot he was making a movie though and attempted to make The Mechanic into the first Blockbuster Snuff Film. The assassinations depicted for these so called professional killers are very close to torture. Long involved scenes of merciless stabbing, choking, crushing, and slicing the contracts they are paid to terminate left me queasy.By halfway through the film I had lost all consideration for any kind of plot. I no longer cared for, or could root for either of the main characters. Once you start thinking that your main heroes should both be lobotomized and incarcerated for life because they are sociopaths, its pretty hard to care if there is a story .All I remember is how bad I felt for the people I was supposed to not care about or even dislike; as they died. So in my opinion, this film was wretched, and forever tarnished the good name of a foundational piece of American Cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In his defense, he does work on a car for two years.This weekend alone (June 24-26, 2016) seven of the top ten were sequels, six of which are Part 2s, but only two successful ones. I am not a sequel hater and believe some are even better than the first one (The Empire Strikes Back, Terminator 2, A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 and 4? just to name a few.) But, when I saw the trailer to the Mechanic follow- up due out soon, it sparked me to finally see the original I hadn't seen before. Or so I thought?Half way through this, I started to recall many of the scenes and set- ups, so I checked my list of movies I've seen and reviewed and it wasn't on there. The second half made me remember?I actually gave up on this movie years ago. Apparently, I only watched the first half and for whatever reason, I turned it off. As a Jason Statham fan and because of the pending sequel, I made sure I finished it this time.Now?that being said, the part about being a Statham fan, this is more or less the stereotypical Statham picture. More of the same: highly trained assassin for hire but far less of the action of his filmography. Which is a bummer. Yeah, I understand he would want to star in more "thought- provoking" action slow burns, but damn, I always want to see him kicking ass?while he still can.I digress. This is the more by-the-numbers action version of Mr. Brooks but so many of the scenes make up for the lack of originality. Especially the predictable, but still enjoyable ending. It's the story of an assassin who must take out the person he doesn't want to and then takes the deceased's son under his wing. You kind of know where this is going from the get-go. So no real shockers.Now, is a sequel really needed, especially 5 years later? Not really. This wasn't groundbreaking or thoroughly interesting enough to ask for one. Plus the action was so subdued that I will see the sequel (due to Statham) but not expecting much.***Final thoughts: This was my bad, so not the movie's fault?but all the way through, I swore the movie's supporting actor was Aaron Paul. I was so convinced that I didn't bother to look up this on IMDb while I watched from home. But, just to make sure, I watched the first part of the end credits to see his name and I was like: WTF? Ben Foster? Oops. That was my Breaking Bad moment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mechanic is really a below average film. It drags along with not much happening, despite stuff happening. Statham plays this Mechanic who is a killer for hire. He seems to get his jobs from Donald Sutherland, and he typically completes the jobs with no one being the wiser.He doesn't trust the govt. But he blindly fulfills the missions he is given like a soldier. Suddenly he forms a partnership with Sutherland's son, Steve (Ben Foster). How does Steve go from nobody to killer? that was a leap, and I think the kid was miscast.The film degrades into a cat and mouse chase game with people trying to kill Statham and Steve, but he of course wipes them all out. The ending is totally Hollywoodian, and so predictable. You'll just say - boy that was NOT a surprise. If you like Statham beating up and killing bad guys, and don't need much of a plot, and sub b-grade acting, you'll be OK with The Mechanic. Otherwise, I suggest you find a different garage for your viewing pleasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be honest with you: I did not enjoy this film. Yea, it did have a few good action scenes, but that's it. Now, these things are the only decent/good stuff that saved this movie from being one of the most boring action films ever: Jason Statham was awesome as always, Ben Foster was also really impressive, the few action scenes in this film were also really good, and lastly- the directing was pretty enjoyable. Now comes the fun part, everything that made this film bad: Not a single character featured in this film has a background, after every single death you're left wondering ''why did they kill him ?'', even the goddamn plot of this film is strange and confusing, you barely know anything about any character in this film and there are even characters that you don't even know their name !!! This is one of those films who can enjoy it ONLY if you don't give a damn about the story or characters and just wanna see good action scenes. You can clearly see that the writers of this film didn't know what they're supposed to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mechanic is a remake of the Michael Winner directed thriller from the 1970s starring Charles Bronson. The remake is a minor pleasure, a stripped down film with Jason Statham playing Arthur Bishop as a reclusive killer who performs hits for a mysterious organisation.His initial scene demonstrates his expertise as Bishop takes out a Colombian drug lord in a crafty manner.Trouble ensues when Bishop is tasked to take out his mentor, Harry McKenna (Donald Sutherland) who is accused of being dirty. Harry's partner Dean (Tony Goldwyn) shows Arthur some evidence of Harry's misdeeds and reluctantly carries out the hit without smelling a double cross, a flaw in the remake and I guess in the original as well.After Harry's death Bishop has to deal with Steve, Harry's estranged son (Ben Foster) and trains him as an assassin in order to stay close with him and also because he feels guilt about what he did to Harry.However this is a start of a cat mouse game as we reckon Steve although close to Bishop also suspects him and is biding his time to gain revenge, while Bishop figures out who the real behind the scenes manipulator was.Director Simon West goes for lean and mean action scenes and relies on Foster's nervy energy to keep things ticking along. Statham's Bishop is painted too much of a nice guy and never comes close to Bronson's silent menace in the original.The film is an enjoyable and engaging action film that never strays too far as a B movie. It wastes some of its supporting actors and despite some good action scenes you feel its rather flawed here and there. Its main failing being you know who the main villain is going to be as he lumbers around like a ghost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well shot waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was recommended to me by a friend, and I had nothing else to do at the moment, so I watched it till the end. It was intriguing with first action, but already after 10 minutes I've realized, that this is going to be a total waste of time. Actually the film could just end there! Well shot with some magnificent special FX and action, this is all that it is. All the rest is based on ridiculously bad, shallow-minded and over-abused clichés - the acting, the plot, the direction, lack of story whatsoever, cliché motives, insights and dialogues, etc. And total lack of humor kills it completely. So my recommendation - if you can abstract from all this and just want to watch some killing action, then go ahead. But if you expect something beyond - don't waste your time...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally, I do not watch these kinds of movies, but I started it so I finished it. To be frank, I did not like this movie: it was too dark and too violent for me. The story starts with a hired assassin doing what he was hired to do. Then the story turns dark when the assassin is ordered to do something he doesn't want to do and then regrets it afterward. He then decides to seek revenge with another assassin he trains who also wants revenge. The acting was good, the story line was a little implausible. I found myself saying, "Yeah, that's really possible!" sarcastically many times during the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In recent years, Director Simon West has become known for turning simple action movies into big hits, thanks his unique story lines. The story doesn't actually mean as much in action films as it does in other genres, because as long as people are getting killed and things are blowing up, most action fans are satisfied. Simon West wasn't and in recent years, he has given us some great stories to go along with the amazing action. His most recent film is actually a remake of the 1972 Charles Bronson classic, by the same name. The Mechanic is a code name for CIA hit-man, Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham). For years, the Mechanic has gotten the job done without question, until one day his next target is revealed as his mentor. The stories are similar, but the special effects and action moves are much more intense, and we have Jason Statham to thank for that. This man has single handedly taken action films to another level. For those unfamiliar, the man speaks several different languages, is trained in dozens of forms of fighting, and he's quick with a joke, many of which are unscripted. Every film Statham does is entertaining for his tremendous moves and unpredictability. The Mechanic gives Statham the chance to show off his talents and for that, I loved it, but trying to modernize the original story without changing it all that much, makes things feel a little outdated. I found many things to be tame by today's standards and the film itself does suffer because of it. Statham is paired with Ben Foster and that's problematic for the film as well. Foster is not known as an action star, he's the complete opposite of Statham, and in this case opposites do not attract, they had no chemistry whatsoever. In my opinion, Jonathan Rhys-Myers or Alex Pettyfer would have been a much better choice, but I am just a reviewer. That being said, the Mechanic isn't a bad movie, it has all the moves and wit of a typical Statham movie, but the story is more than a little outdated and aside from Statham and Sutherland, the casting left a lot to be desired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is One Of Stathams Best Action Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mechanic may not have the critical praise or box office $ as movies like "Snatch", Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" "The Expendables"and the upcoming "Fast 7". But there is one thing it does rank as and that's one of his best pure, balls to the wall action films to date. In the last decade, Statham has consistently delivered hard hitting B Action films and if your a fan of the old school, 80's/90's R rated action, the mechanic is a must watch. For a brisk 90 mins, it manages to provide on some no holds barred, brutal and bloody action. It will remind you of the days when they made more adult oriented action without all that CGI and PG 13 but more fight choreography and realistic stunts and action. I think this is one of the most underrated and one of the better action movies within the last decade.Overall, this is a movie worth watching more than once and if your a fan of action and haven't seen this and your looking for a quick 90 min movie to entertain you without thinking too much, this is highly recommended.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will keep this review like the movie: short, fast paced, and grabs your attention. The movie is sure to keep you entertained, yet there is nothing memorable about it. The plot is very stereotypical of a "secret agent" action film, where there is a double-crosser in an organization and our hero/hit-man tracks them down to hand out his justice. Some of the action is over the top which could have been replaced with some character development or a more intricate, thought through plot . They concluded the film with a quick ending and no explanation for the actions that occurred. In conclusion it was an entertaining action packed 93 minutes, but lacked substance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For what it's worth, it never overstays its welcome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While no one would ever mistake THE MECHANIC for a great movie, for the most part it's a competently done hit-man/mentor film that makes good use of Jason Statham and never overstays its welcome. The scenario is something that's been done many times before: an experienced (sometimes aging, but not in this case) hit-man takes a younger person under their wing as a protégé, and eventually they have to confront each other in some way. Not only has this been done before, but this film is a remake of a 1970's one starring Charles Bronson. Not having seen that one, I can't compare the two, but I also won't debate the merits of this new version existing in the first place. It is what it is, and for what it's worth I thought it was enjoyable, if slightly mundane, way to pass 90 minutes.The character development is kept to a minimum, as is common for films of this type. Jason Statham's character is (obviously) the most fleshed-out person, but Ben Foster gets enough to do and plays off of Statham's character quite nicely. The one person I thought was underused was Donald Sutherland, as Statham's mentor and Ben Foster's father. He only got two scenes, but he still made the most of his limited screen time. Generally speaking, the acting was decent across the board. Even the main villain, despite being underwritten and a bit generic, was well-played.However, the area where this film possibly dips into some murky territory is the ridiculous levels of violence it chooses to show. With the exception of when Statham's character is introduced, there is no subtlety to his process, nor does it go about things in a methodical way to show the intricacies of his profession. Instead, the young upstart basically drags him down and the audience gets treated to explosions of blood and gore that would feel more at home in a "torture porn" movie. I suppose that it's another genre trope that the more experienced professional starts to lose his touch a little bit once he takes on a student, but there are some truly ridiculous scenes between the two as they mow their way through all of the bad guys that are coming their way.Still, this was enjoyable enough due to Jason Statham's charisma and the levity which Ben Foster brought to the proceedings. I wouldn't hate it if they teamed up again for another movie. And barring the, at times, excessive violence, this timeworn story was told with some efficiency, if a little light on originality. Recommended mostly if you're a Jason Statham fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Assassin Jason Statham takes in a protégé, Ben Foster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Mechanic" is a remake of the same-named film made in 1972 that starred Charles Bronson and Jan-Michael Vincent. The original version is definitely better in all departments, especially in acting, suspense and development of the psychology. This version is rather bland by comparison. Nothing really new is brought to the table. The acting in the earlier version is much more expressive. In this version, I never bought into Foster's character, his motivation or his transformation into an effective partner of Statham.The earlier version is gripping all the way. This one just sort of happens along. The film ends up being about average. Probably Statham should not have chosen this vehicle. Statham has his own way of handling roles in his movies. It's very low-key. Statham is likable enough in his roles, but by making this movie he invites comparison with Bronson. Bronson delivered his lines far more forcefully and effectively. Bronson also was more expressive in his eyes and face. Statham is not bad, but he cannot by himself lift this movie above a weak script and a weak sidekick in Ben Foster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He'll fix anything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost everyone I know that has watched this, and the original, swears by the original. Might be true to the extent of how derivative most Simon West movies are. But, for me, someone who hasn't seen the original (my local library has a copy - I'll visit it soon), this one delivered. It's not just another serviceable thriller, though it is predictable the way most mainstream action movies are. However, since its Statham we're talking about, I have to say that this one's quite a few notches superior to his 'Transporter' series (of which I only have affection for the first one), or his 'Expendables' series (West directed the 2nd one, which many fans call the best in the series). The casting's pitch-perfect, and it was an inspired casting choice bringing Ben Foster in, who's walked away with every scene even in the high-profile mainstream flicks he's starred in, including 'Hostage', 'Lone Survivor' and '3:10 to Yuma' (where he upstaged both Bale and Crowe, even though they were were in fine form throughout that superior remake) and had a fantastic turn with Woody Harrelson and Samantha Morton in 'The Messenger'. His role in this is weaker, relatively speaking, and he doesn't have much opportunity to flex his acting chops, since this is Statham's vehicle all the way. But knowing him from all those other efforts, he tries gamely, and gives Statham quite a bit of company, and though I wish his arc was stronger/better-defined, this was better than if someone else was cast in the same role.Sutherland gets too little screen-time, and is wasted, but once again, it's better to have had him in the role than any other alternative.The R-rated action is of the take-no-prisoners variety, juggling that approach with the artistic license / suspension-of-disbelief factor that plagues almost all mainstream action-flicks (thankfully not to the lengths that most B/Tollywood flicks plumb the depths of), that doesn't quite reach the bottoms to which the 'Transporter' movies succumbed to, so that's definitely a relief.Pity it wasn't more substantial though, and hopefully the sequel that's been announced has something good and surprising in store. Worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was different than what I was expecting especially in the beginning where it wasn't your usual mindless Jason Statham action flick. For the first half (anyways) the car chases and cool choreographed fight scenes take a back seat, in fact there are large sections where Statham isn't even in it, he just narrates. Instead we get Ben Foster, which is no hardship.Intriguing story once I got on board, revolving around an elite assassin who gets double crossed and then proceeds to teach his trade to an apprentice who had a connection to one of his previous victims. As things progress the body count rises, Statham shows his moves and things get awesome. The window washing stunt was excellent as was all the twisty double crossing. Great (explosive) ending. 5/24/14</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two words: 'Jason' and 'Statham'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Question 1: Have you watched a Jason Statham film in the last few years? If the answer is yes, then you have basically seen The Mechanic. If the answer is no, then you have to like you action films gritty and violent, but without the big budget that were synonymous with the action stars of the eighties.Question 2: If you have seen a recent Statham movie, did you like it? If the answer is 'yes' then you will probably like this one, too. If the answer is 'no' then move on.Sometimes it feels like 'the Stath' never sleeps. He seems to churn out these sorts of films on a thrice-yearly basis. They all look the same. They all follow the same basic story. And they're all called something like 'The Mark, Sold,' or 'Bullet.' 'The Mechanic' is a remake of an old Charles Bronson film (which I haven't seen, so I can't compare the two). The Stath is an assassin (or 'mechanic' as they call them in this film) who takes on a protégé, played by Ben Foster, in order to - reluctantly - teach him the trade. This he does. And carnage follows.I'd love to give this more than three stars, but the fact that it just blurs into every other Jason Statham film kind of makes it not really that deserving of much more. It's just a typical Statham film. It's getting to the stage that if you've seen one then you've seen them all. Personally, I don't mind a mindless action film here and there, so if I'm in the mood for one then a Statham film does the job.The Mechanic: Enjoyed and forgotten.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

I don't get what this is about. It's kind of East Enders style. A couple of thugs from an English pub with American accents. Realistic filming that you feel like you are on a street in London.

		<fullReview>I'm one of the Bronson generation, so I cherish the original. This release isn't bad however. There are only a few who can equal Bronson, but Statham does a good job. Enough violence, but also enough humor. Actually, he performs a job that can be expected, bearing in mind what he did in the three Transporter movies. BUT: It's a pity that, while in "guntraining",it's so very obvious that blanks are used...... On the other hand: the building up from amateurism to "expertise" is filmed in a way that many movie makers will be jealous of. Pity that Sutherland, like in "The Italian Job", only has a small part. I like this actor very much, an admiration that lasts a long time already. Who doesn't remember Kelly's Heroes? Or the just as hilarious Mash?

		<fullReview>A typical recent Jason Statham outing, although there's less action to begin with than you might expect having witnessed the trailer. THE MECHANIC is a remake of an old Charlie Bronson flick about a hit-man who takes on a young apprentice and the escapades that they subsequently undertake. After a lifetime of jokey action stars delivering quip after quip, it's quite pleasing to see a film that takes a more serious tone than most, with Statham gruffer than usual and few opportunities for humour in the script.The opening of the film works well, introducing the lead character in a way similar to LEON and including a nice-but-brief turn for Donald Sutherland whose presence really starts the ball rolling. Then into the mix we have Ben Foster (3:10 TO YUMA), playing another of his trademark volatile characters, and he brings some much-needed urgency and danger to the production. The story that follows has plenty of inventive moments and certainly keeps you watching throughout, although it's not until late on that the overall structure becomes apparent.Simon West, who once made CON AIR and who has just finished work on THE EXPENDABLES 2, handles the action sequences well; although there's some use of the dreaded shaky-cam here, it's not over-utilised like in other movies, so at the very least you can still see what's going on. There are some good vehicle stunts, plus the requisite fights and shoot-outs, along with a climax that proves dramatically satisfying. THE MECHANIC certainly isn't anything more than a run-of-the-mill action flick but on the other hand it's a run-of-the-mill action flick that does tick all of the right boxes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arthur Bishop is a hired assassin. As such people go, he is a loner. He tends to overpay for his sex and loves living in luxury. His taste in music runs into classical, still playing vinyl LPs rather than CDs. Do not ever touch his turntable! Arthur works for whoever pays enough for him to carry out the executions he is asked to perform. Arthur is a careful man who will look to the minimal detail to ensure a job well done. Meeting his old mentor Harry McKenna brings him back to another era. Harry, confined to a wheelchair, is a marked man now.The appearance of Steve McKenna on the scene, shakes Arthur up. He has come to Bishop in order to get experience to learn how to be a hit man. Well, Steve comes to the best in the business. The first assignment involves a gay man who proves a formidable challenge for the apprentice. After Arthur approves, they pair up in surprising ways. Like in all these stories, one can see an undercurrent of sexual nature between teacher and pupil."The Mechanic" is a remake of the Michael Winner original film, a vehicle for the popular Charles Bronson, who made a career playing tough guys. This version was directed by Simon West, a clear admirer of Mr. Winner. The adaptation of the original material by Lewis John Carlino is credited to Richard Wenk. This update of the story involves the latest advances in special effects. The remake pales in comparison to the original, but it is a mindless piece of film making, more with the eye for entertainment than seriously attempting to bring something new to the screen.Jason Statham, today's action hero is at hand to go through what has been designed for him. As an actor, Mr. Statham does not register much emotion in the movie, something that evidently goes with the territory of being a macho man. Ben Foster is a welcome addition to the picture. He is fun to have around. Donald Sutherland, playing the old McKenna, is only seen briefly. Tony Goldwyn appears as Dean, the influential man who is behind all the unpleasantness in this tale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Remake of the Charles Bronson Jon Michael-Vincent 1972 hit-man thriller this version has a number of scenes inserted into it that are truly stomach crunching and make the original look like an 1940's Walt Disney family flick. Arthur Bishop, Jason Statham,is the #1 hit-man for this shadowy agency who's job it is to eliminate those who deserve eliminating that the US Government can't get it's hands on. It's when Bishop is given an assignment by his boss Dean,Tony Goldwyn, to knock off his best friend and mentor Harry McKenna, Donald Southerland, that for the first time in his career as a hit-man he tries to back out of.Told by Boss Dean that Harry was responsible, by him being paid off by the other side, for the deaths of five hit-men from the agency in a ambush he set up for them in Capetown South Africa Bishop has no choice but to fulfill his duties and obligations for the agency. Bishop knocks off Harry, who's in a wheelchair, in the basement garage of his apartment building making it look like he's the victim of a car-jacking. It's when Bishop meets Harry's estrange son Steve, Ben Foster, he decides with Steve insisting on it to train him to become a top hit-man like himself. The one thing that bothers Bishop is that if Steve finds out that he murdered his dad will he use the training he gives him to murder him in revenge!The film has a certain style to it that the original doesn't have especially in it's ending scene which is a lot less effective as well as unexpected as the one that the 1972 version of the movie had. In fact it's the ending that the screenwriters seemed to have trouble with, in trying to top the original, that actually pulled the movie down a couple of notches. Still there were a number of previous scenes in the film that more then made up for it that weren't in the 1972 version. One of them was the knock down and drag out slug-fest between the 5 foot 9 inch 160 pound Steve McKenna with the 6 foot 7 inch 275 pound gay arms dealer as well as hit-man Burk, Jeff Chase, that must rank among the most ferocious and hard knocking fight scenes in motion picture history.***SPOILERS*** In the end Steve discovers that his good friend and teacher, in killing people, Arthur Bishop did in fact murder his dad but as usual Bishop like with everyone else in the movie, including his back stabbing boss Dean, gets the drop as well as turns the tables on him. Expecting Steve to knock him off Bishop beats him to the punch or gas pump, which is no surprise to anyone watching the movie, and with that and a timer or a timing device in his painfully remodeled sport-scar Bishop ends the movie with a bang to end all bangs. Also check out actor John McConnell who plays Vaughn a phony religious cult leader, who has a habit of raping the female members of his cult, in the film that both Bishop &amp; Setve end up, with an induced drug overdose, knocking off. The guy McConnell is the spitting image of Baseball immortal and New York Yankee outfielder Babe Ruth. So much so that you expected Vaughn, as he was being put under by Bishop &amp; Steve McKenna, to get up and come out swinging with a 44 once, the Babe's favorite, baseball bat aimed right at their skulls!</fullReview>

Sutherland, seeing that there is no way out, tells the guy to blow him a way while he sits in his wheelchair. The Sutherland character is estranged from his son. The latter soon appears and the "mentored" one and the son become a two-man killing machine.The rest of the film is devoted to how they slay their victims. Of course, the guy finds out that the mentored one had killed his father.The ending is where the two try to outwit each other. It's predictable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eternally cool Jason Statham is once again in his element in this remake of the 1972 Charles Bronson vehicle. He's Arthur Bishop, a highly efficient killer for hire who's placed in the unfortunate position of being asked to murder his father figure / mentor Harry McKenna (Donald Sutherland). Up to now he's always been able to be completely detached about his work, but not so this time. Now he's determined to learn the truth and get some payback on behalf of Harry. He acquires an unlikely partner of sorts in the form of Harry's ne'er-do-well son Steve (Ben Foster), who himself is hungry for revenge and wants Bishop to tutor him in the fine art of killing. "The Mechanic" is rather by the numbers - it is entertaining enough while it lasts, but even with its climactic twists, it doesn't pack too much punch. It's really rather predictable, even more so for those who remember the original film, which was notable for its double twist ending. It's all very competent; director Simon West does have experience in the genre having worked on such things as "Con Air" and "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider". It may not be particularly well written, but it still serves its purpose. Not that many of us would watch something like this for the story, anyway. The characters aren't the most likable, but the performances are still respectably effective. Pros such as Sutherland and Tony Goldwyn make the most of their clichéd roles. Foster is especially good as the tough enough but reckless and naive tyro, and Statham is found to be in fine form here. Impressive widescreen photography, New Orleans location shooting, and an eclectic soundtrack help to make the movie an acceptable diversion. It opens well, and is sufficiently well paced from then until its explosive finish. Six out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a lot better than anticipated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I imagined this film to be like and what I felt watching it were completely different. I have not seen loads of Jason Stathams films but by the ones I have I have often found him very one dimensional but in this film his character seems to fit this acting persona perfectly.Statham plays a professional assassin who is hired for jobs and is one of the best, efficient and ultra professional. He displays little emotion and always gets the job done even if it means having to kill his friend and mentor played by Donald Sutherland but that is also the start of when things get complicated. Enter Sutherlands Son played excellently by Jon Foster he naturally wants answers and revenge knowing nothing of Stathams involvement in his Fathers murder. Then Statham seeing Fosters violent and clumsy attempts at getting to the truth feels obliged somewhat to train and harness his rage. He then decides to make him his partner but after a close call and finally one assassination goes wrong it seems the company hiring them both is starting to question their partnership. Statham soon finds himself now a target, it seems his idea of some sort of redemption has backfired and when Foster learns that he killed his Father it seems hes right in the middle.The story had a lot more layers than I imagined as just a brainless actioner there are twists and turns and I think Statham was a perfect choice for the role. His character needs to be mentally tough throughout but also he has the physical look required in the action scenes which I think are well placed within the fairly complex story. I especially like the fact that this film is not just a relentless exercise in violence and like I said before Jason Statham credits from this as the strong silent type showing little emotion it is perfectly suited to his acting style.A very good film that at around an hour an half is perfectly paced with surprising substance and my favourite Statham performance so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but could've been great...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a really good movie but there was a severe flaw in the premise that stops it from being great. Statham was outstanding as usual and Ben Foster was actually really impressive. The action sequences were great and the acting and plot was interesting. Here's where that flaw in the premise hurt it though (SPOILER ALERT!): When Statham's character approaches Donald Sutherland's character to kill him, they talk first. Sutherland asks Statham whether this was for the South Africa incident. Statham says yes. While this can be looked at various ways, the most obvious way is that Sutherland did indeed seem guilty and didn't try to explain his innocence to his good friend who would've likely seen the sincerity in him. This premise led to the plot for the final "target" and it didn't work. Still a good movie if you can get past that but that was pretty major nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No need trying to compare this movie with the Charles Bronson 1972 original; its like comparing apples and oranges. Simon West directs and Jason Statham stars as Arthur Bishop, a hit man that unfortunately gets the assignment to kill his mentor Harry McKenna(David Sutherland). After the deed is done, McKenna's son Steve(Ben Foster), wants to become Arthur's apprentice and learn the ways of killing for a profession. This partnership works well, but messier than Bishop likes. Things get real dicey when Arthur discovers that the man he gets most of his work from, Dean(Tony Goldwyn), has turned on him. Now Bishop is the target and must turn the tables around quickly. During preparation Steve discovers that Bishop is the one paid to kill his father. The pair continue with this major hit, but Steve still has vengeance on his mind. Adrenoline rush. High octane violence...over kill. (Exactly what you would expect). Also in the cast: Mini Anden, Jeff Chase and John McConnell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mechanic is a good movie. It has action, vengeance in large amounts. Jason Statham is always good in these kind of movies. He portrays his role cleanly and excellently.An assassin type movie with a slight difference in storyline but I think the story could have been little bit more better.Ben Foster is good, however, he needs more perfection. The storyline took off to a flying start with the initial scenes. But it slowed down in the middle parts. The ending could have been a little better. The music of the movie is somewhat common, somewhat fresh. All in all, a good movie...I would rate it 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. This one delivers everything we have come to expect from a Jason Statham movie ... plenty of action, fight scenes, gun play and a man wronged by the system who is on a mission for vengeance. It is a remake of the 1972 film starring Charles Bronson and Jan Michael Vincent, and written by Lewis John Carlino.As in the original, a hit-man takes an apprentice under his wing. Here, it's played by Ben Foster, who was so good in "3:10 to Yuma". Foster brings energy and intensity to his role, and a playfulness that Statham doesn't always appreciate. The two have pretty good chemistry, but face it, the only real reason to watch this movie is for action scenes and violence.Donald Sutherland has a fairly brief role as Statham's mentor and the film definitely misses him once he's gone. The bad guy is played by Tony Goldwyn, who just doesn't have the screen presence to play a big time baddie. Goldwyn is an excellent TV director and seems much better suited behind the camera. He has been typecast as the bad guy ever since "Ghost" and his presence often evokes groans from the audience.No surprises in this one, which is fine. With Statham movies ... we want what we expect. Nothing more, and certainly nothing less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>for an action film. I like Jason Statham, but this is not his best movie. I wouldn't even call it one of his better movies. There just wasn't enough action. Statham usually has cool car chase scenes and funny one liners. The best action in this movie was the very beginning when he meets the guy swimming. The light moment in this movie was the spiritual guru whom has a ketamine problem, sort of like Michael Jackson. And you just knew he was too cool to get taken out by his apprentice.FINAL VERDICT: Not a great script. Pick one of Statham's earlier movies.</fullReview>

Statham does more than a stellar job, with a great "side-kick" Ben Foster (one of the better young actors around right now).The story can be read here on IMDb, though it's not really that important. What is important right here, are the action pieces and the stunt work. All very fine and well shot. And to see Donald Sutherland (even in a small role) is always a treat.

		<fullReview>People used to Transporter (and the like) are gonna get a surprise in this movie. Jason Statham plays a professional killer the true, serious and credible way. The kind of role that is usually reserved to the "elite" actors of this kind of film genre, like Bruce Willis or more recently Matt Damon. The Mechanic gives Statham the legitimacy he deserves to play the same role in place of such actors.In the Transporter Statham plays a hero in a movie where nothing, no situation and nobody is really taken seriously. The charismatic actor injects a lot of humor that matches perfectly his character.In the Mechanic, we have a still charismatic actor who plays a serious role that doesn't allow the same humorous attitude. While some elements are predictable, the script is not bad, and even offers much originality. Also, Donald Sutherland plays remarkably the killer's mentor.All in all, this is an enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

It just felt like the director had run out of ideas after he had written the beginning middles and end. And when Statham was training Foster I just felt that its jumped from foster being a normal bum strait to a highly skilled killing machine.

		<fullReview>Why you should see it To paraphrase Steve, you've always had a lot of anger, and you feel like you've finally found someplace to put it. The action is cleverly plotted and well executed. Foster is effective as someone who has found something he's fairly good at (killing people) and finds it intoxicating.Why you shouldn't see it In this version of The Mechanic (I haven't seen the first), the relationship between Bishop and Steve doesn't ring true (nor do some of Bishop's motives and reactions), perhaps because Statham and director West make Bishop a cipher, and this apparently precludes acting. You insist on seeing originals before their remakes, and you're still working through your Bronson library.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film does not deserve more than 1 / 10. It is a pity that now it is 3 or 4 mega-companies that control the films and distribution. It does no good. These companies think only about making money quickly by taking classics and making remakes.This film is a good example. The 1972 version with Charles Bronson is a good film. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068931/But the remake of 2011 is very bad. The actors and photography are correct. The music of this film is the same as found in thousands of films. It's always the same. The "composer" just changes the notes on his computer to use this music bad stuff for all films.The screenplay for the 2011 version has nothing to do with that of 1972. Again we take a good script and made into a ridiculous stuff. Another example is the Planet of the Apes. It seems that Century 21 was more than ideas and we think that money. This is not surprising because everything is increasingly controlled by a small gang of people with no imagination who only think about money.If you have never seen the movie The Mechanic (1972) leased it or buy the film. You will not be disappointed. I give it 8 / 10. But the version of 2011, forget it. It's just too bad. Take a good movie to make this horror is unforgivable. It's like taking a Rembrandt and put paint on top.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Expert assassin Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) is a true professional, who is unconnected to those he is assigned to take out and does the job to the highest standard. When he finds out his mentor Harry (Donald Sutherland) betrayed him and was behind some friends of his being killed, he takes his revenge. But when his son Steve (Ben Foster) falls under his wing, he finds a protégé with the fire in his heart to do the job perfectly, who only needs to learn to control himself. But Arthur's guilty secret is a ticking time bomb waiting to explode.The 'action star' game isn't what it was during the 90s, with Jason Statham being the closest we have to being what you might call a 'bona fide' one at the moment. Not as much variety as there used to be, and all of his films are pretty much as interchangeable as each other, such as this remake of Charles Bronson's 1972 action film. Formulaic, predictable, nonsensical and totally incoherent, The Mechanic may well be just what a lot of ardent Statham fans are looking for. But Simon West's first big screen action adventure in ages will certainly have a hard time of it appealing to more demanding viewers. **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All Jason Statham's movies follow relatively same pattern. He is a "hero" (who always survives, no matter what), and everybody else is expendable. Story is relatively simple, somehow predictable, does not require "special acting abilities", and carries the movie itself. This is also such a "balanced" movie: has everything it needs, in right quantities and qualities, skillfully distributed and mutually connected. Viewer has only to sit back, relax, watch and enjoy. And that is what movies should be about: entertainment. This one is a bit on the lighter side but - hey! - you drain yourself intellectually on the job and you need something else to occupy your mind. This is it. A fair job for the viewer who does not require enlightenment and moral (unless you're a hit-man, of course ? there are some useful tricks here). A good movie.</fullReview>

He kills people the entire movie and all that time the viewer has no doubt he will succeed. There is no drama, no unexpected, nothing interesting. Ben Foster's character is just tagging along for a while, but never grabs the spotlight.A while ago I've read a quote that I liked that said that any good story shows a character changing. They either learn something or die learning nothing - thus proving the point. The reader would identify with someone in the story, then emerge changed as the character evolves. In this film, nothing evolved in any way. There were two almost insignificant twists, but then, they were completely predictable.Bottom line: I give this movie a fail, not because the action scenes were not good enough, because they were, but because the script made them out of place and superfluous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Someone needs to tinker under the hood of this flawed action 'vehicle'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well imagine my surprise! After a career built on playing similar characters over and over it seems one Jason Statham is finally branching out. From this point on he will obviously no longer be the strong silent type who drives fast cars, shoots bad guys dead and casually loses his shirt a couple times a film before plowing the nearest hot chick in need.Not anymore amigos.In one of the more audacious developments in Jason Statham's career he takes a role that has nothing to do with guns, violence or action by taking the lead role in a film revolving around a hard working grease monkey? HEY WAYYYYT A MINUTE! It seems I was hoodwinked by clever Hollywood marketing. Mr Statham is in fact Arthur Bishop, a deadly assassin who drives fast cars, kills bad guys and plows hot chicks ? though in a huge change this particular one didn't seem to be in any great need of anything aside from a dose of STATHAM! (He also loses his shirt within the first 3 minutes of screen time. I wonder if he really needs to wear a shirt in the first place?) When his beloved wheelchair bound boss (Donald Sutherland) and assigner of jobs is himself hit Bishop decides to apprentice the boss's son Steve (Ben Foster), as allowing him to wallow in his remorse and rage filled self-pity is likely to see him dead anyway. Might I pause here and say that Foster has the good/bad combination of looking like the offspring of Giovanni Ribisi and Bradley Cooper? I'll let you decide where the good/bad lies.After a three minute montage Steve is still raw and rough around the edges, but apparently proficient enough that Bishop assigns him jobs of his own. The first job is a little messy, but you have to expect that from your apprentices don't you? After all we all have to learn somewhere.But sometimes when someone hires a professional to perform a task they can be sticklers for the rules, and allowing an apprentice to do the job doesn't quite cut it, especially if they royally f*ck it up.In this case it leads to outside contractors being called in to 'clean up'? I have made mention previously that Jason Statham is less an actor than a product, an indication of quality that allows a certain advance expectation from the audience before they even buy a ticket or read a review.In that way he's like Coke, even if you haven't had one for a while you know roughly what it will taste like and there are no surprises once you pop the cap. It might not blow you away but it is reliable.The Mechanic has none of the life and unpredictability of the Crank films, none of the humour of the Guy Ritchie films, none of the spark and dependability of the Transporter films.Final Rating ? 5 / 10. The Mechanic has a few scenes that are OK but? furthering the above analogy this isn't The Real Thing, this Coke is flat.One last point: I know films have running times, and I'm by no means suggesting someone needs to prove this using me as a guinea pig; but why does it take only 8 seconds or so to strangle someone on film??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mechanic sees Jason Statham in a role that he rarely leaves these days as a vigilante, in this case called Arthur who fights against many enemies. The plot takes it's slight twist by the addition of a sidekick of sorts in the form of Steve (Ben Foster).Arthur is a lone hit-man who is very good at what he does by eliminating targets whilst making them look like accidents. But when his mentor Harry (Donald Sutherland) is killed leaving behind his son Steve, Arthur takes him under his wing and trains him up, teaching him the ways of becoming a successful hit-man. Together they carry out contracts while all the time trying to unravel who killed Harry and why.The movie is enjoyable with the action and methods in which the contracts are executed making it a decent watch but it never really takes off as a film tending just to jump from one death to another without giving enough plot to keep me overly interested.I'm actually finding it quite hard to talk about anything else in this movie because there just isn't that much to talk about. The acting was OK, not bad or amazing and the same can be said of the rest of it as well. It delivers on the action scenes but a film cannot be totally reliant on just action to see it through.I think this can be summed up as a typical Statham movie with lots of action, a story that is never going to blow you away and a girl or two thrown in for good measure. Probably not as good as Crank but gives you a similar way to spend an hour and a half if your looking for a reasonable action/thriller. If that's not what your after then this won't be one for you. Wait for it to come out as a cheap DVD or on the TV.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The MechanicThe reason why mechanics make such excellent assassins must be because they can take out targets by over-charging them to death.Oops! Apparently, the designation of mechanic in this action movie is a sobriquet for contract killer, and not a comment on the exorbitant cost of parts and labour.After assassin Bishop (Jason Statham) executes his mentor McKenna (Donald Sutherland) on the command of his clandestine employer, he takes McKenna's willful son Steve (Ben Foster) under his wing and teaches him the skills to kill.Under his mentorship, Steve tethers his recklessness as he finds a father figure in Bishop. Meanwhile, he draws ever closer to the man who killed his father.A bombastic interpretation of the 1972 classic, this version updates the story, the pacing and the violence, but fails to obscure the obvious climax.Besides, doesn't an old assassins' proverb state: The student will someday garrote their teacher?

		<fullReview>Hit-man Arthur Bishop (Statham) takes Steve (Foster) under his wing and teaches him the hit-man ropes. When Steve learns Bishop's secret, it's a question of who is going be killed first. This is a remake of the film with Charles Bronson and Jan-Michael Vincent back in the day. Naturally, we can expect more violence and CGI that weren't in the Bronson film. (Was this film better?) Not really. (Well, what was wrong?)We accept violence in movies featuring hit men, but in here there was a meanness to some of the violence, and overkill in places. Really wasn't called for. We had topless lesbians kissing and a pedophile hit-man going after Steve. And, oh, yes an almost x-rated sex scene. I think they brought everything but the kitchen sink to this one. It's like they believed they were filming in the 1980s when a lot of the above came into play. I understand that life is life, but these things really didn't belong in this remake of a classic. Am pretty sure the original didn't have any of this. And, if I am recalling correctly , in the original, more time was spent by Bronson training Vincent. And, whether we wanted to or not, we learned more hit-man stuff than we ever wanted to know, but it was well done, engaging, and informative. I am not sure if CGI or actual stunts were used, but if actual stunts were used, they were spectacular. Kudos. It's fast paced and entertaining and okay with the exceptions noted above. Mostly it was the violence with meanness that hurt. The original movie had a certain amount of class and is a better film.Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, almost x-rated. Nudity: Yes. Language: Yes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mechanic?????.What I do requires a certain mindset.Jason Statham (Arthur Bishop) plays the title role, an elite assassin with a skill to eliminate his targets in a clean fashion. He believes that the best jobs are the one's nobody ever knows you were there. Donald Suherland (Harry McKenna) is his boss cum mentor and Ben Foster (Steve) plays the part of his son. Harry and Dean (Goldwyn) are partners and they give their "assignments" to Arthur. Dean approaches Arthur with a contract of killing Harry with citing the reason that Harry is no more loyal to the company.After Arthur is done with Harry, Steve comes in the picture with urge to learn the skills to become a "Mechanic". They hit it off well with their assignments. But soon Arthur comes to know that he had been deceived by Dean to kill Harry. Both Arthur and Steve go on a Seek and Destroy mission and are eliminate the Dean. During the entire sequence, Steve gets hold of his father's gun and he gets to know that it was none other than Arthur who had killed his father and then the climax.The direction, script and screenplay are just average, speaking of which this is a remake of a movie with the same name which came back in 1972. Haven't watched it so no comparison.In a Nutshell:Betrayal and Vengeance complete the movie.a)Highlights: Performances by both Jason Statham and Ben Foster are good. Statham blends with his character very well and Foster is just brilliant in his attitude and body-language.b)Flaws : There are thriller clichés and the action sequences are just average.

OK some will question my grasp on believability but I think most will know where I'm coming from. Stratham will mostly be type cast for the rest of his career but if he keeps offering up efforts like this then I will fill a seat , he is good in this as were the the rest of the cast. Good show. As I said earlier regarding realism the only thing that stuck out for me on short recollection was when they were target shooting a blank casing was filmed leaving the breach in slow mo.,( in other words there wasn't much in this movie to put me off) Recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could almost be Transporter 4. In the original Charles Bronson was a cold killer with no conscience and few redeeming qualities. He recognised this in his protégé. In the end of that film, the apprentice kills Bronson almost as his qualifying exam.But Stratham, bless him, must always play the hero. In this sugary remake he is still a ruthless killer, but one with a conscience. He agonises over killing his long-term friend. His targets are all terrible people. He is a goody, even if he has to coat the walls with blood to prove it. He trains up Foster, not because he sees potential, but as guilty reparation for killing his dad.Foster, rather than killing Stratham to prove he can, kills him out of revenge. But of course, this is Hollywood and the goody can never be killed, so Stratham survives to appear in Transporter 57.The violence is comic-book graphic, with the copious blood splatter losing its impact very quickly, and multiple car wrecks and machine-gunning going apparently unnoticed in the city centre.It's OK for a laugh and for the stunts, and of course Stratham is eye-candy for the girls, but it's not a patch on the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Statham delivers old fashioned Statham ... Yes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading the already written reviews after seeing this movie i'm really wondering and surprised at the same time: Dear audience, this is a Statham, do you need a bigger warning? Do not compare it to the original, that's only just a waste of time because it's impossible: in the end nobody CAN touch the cult status of ultimate revenger Mr. Bronson.(With some changes, e.g. the title it would even have been a better idea to just let this one stand on itself.) There we have a movie with no real surprises, some plot holes but overall a reasonable solid story, and a lot of action, good enough to entertain you for the 85 minutes it lasts a.k.a. all the ingredients I expect when I see 'Statham' on the cover/poster!So if you don't expect a fine art house movie with real special and surprisingly acting performances, as you should, you will like it. Simple.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Jason Statham action flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Statham plays contract killer Arthur Bishop; a man who gets the job done cleanly and efficiently. He doesn't get attached to people and considers his employer Harry McKenna to be his only friend. Still that doesn't stop him taking the job when he is given the job of killing Harry who had apparently betrayed another team of assassins in Cape Town. Arthur has always worked alone but now he feels obliged to help Harry's son Steve and ends up taking him under his wing. Harry trains Steve and soon lets him do a job on his own; it is far from clean and efficient. Their next job takes them to Chicago where Arthur seems one of the South African team alive and well? he was played and know he is going after the person who told him to kill his friend. Arthur isn't the only person looking for revenge and when Steve learns who killed his father it looks as if Arthur might have reached the end of the line.The remake of the '70s thriller, which starred Charles Bronson, is entertaining with plenty of action; some of it fairly brutal. Jason Statham excels in roles like this and while it isn't his best film it is still likely to please his fans. The story itself is hardly the most original but that doesn't matter as it's all about the action and that is pretty good. Ben Foster does a decent job as Steve and veteran actor Donald Sutherland puts in a good but brief performance as Harry. Obviously in a film like this one must suspend ones disbelief? most notably you have to accept that somebody as careful as Arthur would work with a loose cannon like Steve! Overall if you enjoy 'brain in neutral' action I recommend checking this one out. Unfortunately I can't say how it compares to the original as haven't seen it since the '80s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The next best Bronson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many moons ago I watched this really cool 70's action/thriller "The Mechanic" starring two bona fide cult icons, Charles Bronson and Jan-Michael Vincent. It was ? and still is ? a terrific film, full of awesome stunts and a unique chemistry between the lead actors, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone. Now, I thought that Hollywood only did remakes of popular horror movies, but apparently they also desecrate milestones in the action genre these days. Oh well, let's not be too much of a sourpuss, as the new version of "The Mechanic" nevertheless became a fast-paced and extremely violent popcorn flick with the (according to me, at least) best possible casting choices. Like 99% of all remakes, it's obviously a redundant and unsurprising movie and the plot will only seem innovative to younger action devotees who refuse to seek out older films. Arthur Bishop is a special breed of perfectionist assassin. He's punctual, always prepared and manages to make every murder assignment look like an ordinary accident. When he's forced to eliminate his mentor - and closest thing to a friend ? Harry McKenna, Arthur feels emotionally responsible to look after his ruthless and uncontrollable son. He also wants to become a professional hit man and to avenge his father, so what better person to get a training from? Good to see that "The Mechanic" isn't as over-the-top, preposterous and ludicrous as most action movies nowadays (for example: "Shoot 'em Up", "Machete" or "The Expendables") but still too much of the shoot outs and combat battles are overly chaotic, roughly edited and too obviously computer generated. I'm particularly thankful for the casting of Jason Statham and Ben Foster. Statham is what I call the "next best Bronson" and the most apt choice to depict a stoic and invincible killer. Foster, perhaps one of the most gifted young actors in America at the moment, is equally great as the impulsive and aggressive pupil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty psychological underpinnings make this more than gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Statham as The Mechanic is cold, careful and completely focused on the job in hand. No grandstanding, no ego, simply precision work. So detached is he that he's the go-to guy for all the jobs nobody else in his agency is willing to do. And that finally becomes a problem.With a minimally sufficient amount of set-up, the problem job pulled me in as it should. But that's only where things began to get interesting. From there the plot complications pile up and the action ramps up, with more psychological twists than a bag full of pretzels. Yes, they're fairly predictable, these twists, but compelling and well-crafted in both the writing and the filming.Overall, The Mechanic is a thoughtful look at the limits of loyalty and the compulsions of guilt, wound through a gritty, noisy, gory action plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason Statham is back as Jason Statham</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A hardened and essentially ruthless contract killer Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) deals with death, handing it out clean and preferably in ways which suggest natural causes or suicide. Hence whenever such a specialist 'mechanic' is needed Bishop is there for the job. Unfortunately one of his employs mark his surrogate father figure Harry McKenna (Donald Sutherland). Despite his misgivings and inner turmoil Bishop carries out the hit like a true professional. Nonetheless with the remnants of human emotionality coupled with his heightened anxiety of continuing his profession he decides to take on McKenna's son, Steve (Ben Foster) as his protégé and slowly shows him the tricks of the trade.Jason Statham comes to the forefront of this miscued remake playing the only character he can play: Jason Statham, a tough, burly, charming, wisecracking English man with muscles bulging as a replacement for facial interaction. Despite admirable attempts by Sutherland (and not helped by a bland Ben Foster) this is Statham's movie to make or break. And break it he does. Overly reminiscent of mindless action movies such as "Transporter" the remake lacks any refinement, instead sticking with the base premise, but without the meaty psychological turmoil. Everything is easy and rushed, quickly coming to a conclusion in MTV fashion, also destroying the gist of the original with a Hollywood twist at the ending (while inexplicably somehow whitewashing Statham's character and making him someone the audience is supposed to root for).A miserable 2011 remake, which - however poor a picture it was - had an intriguing premise, instilling a sense of curiosity. "The Mechanic" (1972) may feel crude and sometimes understated by modern standard, nonetheless the movie is made by the rough sensitivity of Charles Bronson counterpointed by the youthful haphazard exuberance of Vincent. Together they truly interact with half-glances, muffled exchanges and a building tension between the characters. Much more dark and lacking the contrition of the remake, the original feels honest and direct, murky in detail, much like the self-destructive life of the hit-man, whose only solace is that of a paid hooker pretending proximity and feeling. Conversely the remake is just an empty shell, which rehashes the contemplative original to a mindless contrition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than most movies about hit men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie on a plane while I was flying over Indonesia to Hong Kong (which was my first ever international trip). The plane had little televisions in the backs of the seats and there was a huge selection of music and movies to keep us entertained. I really do hope that Singapore Airlines also has the same options when I travel to Europe in six weeks time. Unfortunately, because I flew back at night, I was simply too exhausted to watch a movie on the way back, and I also wanted to read. However, enough of that experience and more on the movie.I've always liked movies about hit men going about their daily business, however in many cases I never end up being all that satisfied with them. A lot of the movies only ever have then actually performing two or three hits, though there is usually some massive gunfight involved in which they end up defeating all of their enemies singlehandedly (namely because they are actually really good at what they do, though I have never actually heard of any real person that has actually been able to do that. The only people that seem to be able to leave large body counts tend to end up gunning down unarmed civilians).This movie is no different, but is better than most (probably because of Jason Stratham, though I would hardly call him a good actor, at least he is better than some, and a lot of his films tend to be dark and gritty, such as this one). The problem that I had with this film is that it seems to be a little to disjointed and disconnected in parts, and while the film seems to flow for a bit at the beginning, then end seemed to have been really rushed, and it felt like it jumped a bit.Basically Arthur (Jason Stratham) is a Mechanic, somebody who fixes problems, usually by killing them. Mind you, he is not an enforcer (the hit-man who simply shoots somebody and lets everybody else clean up the mess), but he does it in a way that it either looks like an accident, or he can blame somebody else for the deed (the first is made to look like an accidental drowning, while the second is made to look like a car-jacking). However, things change when he takes on an apprentice, and suddenly the hits are no longer as smooth and flawless as they were at the beginning. However, the catch is that the apprentice happens to be the wayward son of one of his targets.There is a plot in this film, but it seems to float in the back and the main focus seems to be about Arthur passing on his trade to a younger generation (though in the end this trade is never actually passed on. Arthur is not too old, and he is not getting rusty either. He is very good at what he does). Mind you, it is clear that Arthur is actually very smart, and knows how to do his job well, though when he does uncover the backstabbing within his organisation, the film jumps straight to the execution of the plan rather than the plan itself, or even any discussion of the reason behind why they are doing what they are doing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen the original, which was pretty ropey to begin with, I didn't know what to expect from this movie.Whilst some of the action scenes OK, the dialogue has to be one of the worst ever, barely surpassed by the poor quality acting. You so want it to improve. Characters are very 2 dimensional and seem to be going through the motions. This is a movie in search of a little substance. The sum of the parts are definitely not equal to the whole. You can tick most of the boxes as the components are all there, they just don't all click together. It's a shame, as I really wanted to kick back and watch a proper action flick, but came away utterly disappointed.If you like your action movie to contain little or not plot and dreadful dialogue, then this is for you...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mechanic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loose (and I mean LOOSE) remake of the classic Chuck Bronson/Michael Winner 70s winner has Jason Statham starring a contract killer, Arthur Bishop, who apprentices a volatile, very angry young man, Steve McKenna (Ben Foster, incredibly intense, with a brooding rage that is present throughout) the son of his own mentor, Harry (Donald Sutherland, a ton of fun in his small supporting role, setting up the remainder of the movie). Bishop primarily takes contracts from a corporate bigwig, Dean (Tony Goldwyn, not much to do but look rich and untrustworthy) whose headquarters resides in a tall, long high-rise. The dilemma facing Bishop is that he must take out Harry due to a supposed betrayal of their company. Out of sympathy for having to kill Harry, Bishop will apprentice Steve and the two work together on some contracts before Dean decides to take them out, kind of rid himself of "loose ends". Of course, all Dean does is sign his own death warrant as Bishop and Steve come after him, eliminating anyone that gets in their way. This is basically The Transporter but far more bloodier, with the additional killing machine of young Foster who, I've got to say, looks damn good in The Mechanic killing folks. Even if he's little and doesn't look intimidating/imposing, Foster's scene with a giant contract killer, a gargantuan closet homosexual whose only weakness is young gay men, sure gives him an authenticity as a fierce individual you don't want to mess with. Statham doesn't stretch himself here?as always he looks like a million bucks, a handsome, cool customer who is quick and seems to know every killer's moves before they do, dispatching gunmen in a rapid pace, barely breaking a sweat. While many people would be crapping in their pants while hanging off of a building many stories above ground, holding onto the foot of a man trying to kill him, Statham doesn't seem bothered at all. Foster's ultimate undoing is not his skills?Statham's training allows him to grow into an affective killing machine?but his inner demons. The drinking and the inability to shake off the anger inside him proves to be the character Steve's major malfunction while Bishop is always vacant such rage, always in control and never mentally cluttered by distractions. If you like plenty of bloody violence with lots of men suffering from gunfire, and a lack of originality, then The Mechanic will be up your alley. Neither the outcome nor Dean's betrayal surprised me in the least, and I'm sure it didn't other action fans. You could call this The Transporter 4, to be honest. Mini Anden leaves *quite* an impression as a sultry hooker Statham is often a customer of after a major hit, he uses to "unwind". Such a violent film does need some decent eye candy and Anden services us well in that department.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What i like about Jason Statham is he knows what he does best. He doesn't pick movies that are beyond him , he just picks movies he knows he can do and more to the point he can do well. The Mechanic is the story of a Hit-man who takes on an accomplice who is the son of one of friends and who was also one of victims. This a pretty much what you would expect when you look at the film cover and it never once lets you down in the entertainment stakes. It's full of fights , explosions and plot twists and at 90 minutes is great big bundle of fun.Ben Foster is great as is Tony Goldwyn but there is no doubt who is the start.The Mechanic far fetched and a little bit silly at times but you cant help but like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He can do more than just fix cars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Statham plays an assassin named Arthur Bishop who's able to get in and out squeaky clean as he focuses on the job at hand without distraction. His only friend, Harry Mckenna, played by Donald Sutherland, works in the same covert business he does. A hit is put out on Harry and the company they both work for wants Arthur to personally take care of it.The job was successful by making it look like carjackers but came with some suppressed anger afterwards. In the original '72 version Charles Bronson's character gets actively pursued and gives in because he sees a potential companion like himself who can keep up from being a long time loner and introvert. Instead, here, Arthur sticks around to instead help the man's son Steve Mckenna (Ben Foster) learn some responsibility and how to get away with revenge for "those" to blame through the best way he knows how to teach him: as a "mechanic" who covertly kills without a trace being left as to who did it or what really happened. Steve Mckenna in the original didn't pose as much of a threat as he was cocky, unemotional and cared nothing of his father, except here Ben Foster plays the character as an emotional wreck who wants vengeance. If anybody said they would have left the son alone, moved or killed him secretly knowing that you took his father's life and that he's a loose canon, raise your hand. It seems unlikely that a professional like Bishop would leave any loose ends untended and I'm not sure why they changed this important element in the story.His trainee has a lot of work to get to pro status with his bad habits of sabotaging what he has, making impulsive decisions and taking unnecessary risk for no other reason than because he can--everything that Bishop isn't about, as he checks his emotions at the door and goes in with stern-faced calculation. Yet, that doesn't stop the mentor from taking his reckless trainee out on his own jobs possibly as a little pay back to the company for making him kill the closet thing he had to a friend. What ever happened to the trainee's want for revenge for some carjackers, who knows? Again, some of the transitions of the story in the remake were changed and cause this to lose a sense of purpose. In a one in a million chance (more like a cheap writing ploy) Bishop spots someone of interest who has ties to a past mission after escaping from a less than smooth job himself. What a small world we live in that you just sit down at the bus station and so happen to see the one man that's relevant to you without even having to make an effort. Must have been born with a third eye. The company is getting fed up, along with the trainee Steve beginning to put two and two together about who really killed his father if it wasn't inevitable enough. However, this is the Mechanic they're dealing with, you know, that cinematic guy who's faster, smarter and quicker on his feet than anyone or anything.This has a decent amount of over-the-top action and more bullets are managed to be fired than most westerns. The filmmakers were trying to sell the audience that this could be you taken under the wing of a hired gun. It beats the 9 to 5 job, you get drunk, sleep around, fire weapons, go out on high octane missions and, best of all, there are never any cops around and you get away with it. Did I mention all your opponents have terrible aim and you don't get shot despite only a short amount of training? Yep, just that simple. Ben Foster's character has some room to work with but not enough to be on par with "Hostage." It's still more than Jason Statham's role in how it feels like an out-of-the-box version of other modern action films. Not to mention his very own "The Transporter," which holds steady as the superior film with just as basic of a story and probably as much exaggeration, but much more fluidity and no silly deus ex machina writing tricks to distract.This includes jumping off high things, property damage, candid wounds and blood spray--though it's not enough to save it in the end as there's very little that sticks, not even a charismatic villain to remember this by as they're cardboard personalities make it easier to murder them without growing a conscious. As a purely logical movie this remake doesn't entirely work. Check out "From Paris with Love," "Unstoppable" or "Faster" if you need a recent action fix that keeps it basic and unmuddled, while still balancing entertainment. Or just stick with the original '72 version which pans out more fluidly even if it's a more gradual experience. See profile for original review also.

		<shortDescription>Cashing in on the Jason Statham Image. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Mechanic' is a mindless romp. Completely forgettable with not much good to say about it. I'll organize my good and bad thoughts on the film.The Good: -It had Jason Statham. He's pretty cool, right? -There was at least one good fight scene.-Uhhhhh... I guess the movie had some cool cars?The Bad:- Pointless sex scenes just for the sake of having a sex scene. This statement speaks for itself. I see too many movies now-a-days where a sensual situation will be thrown in only for the sake of pleasing the target audience (males ranging from 15-30.)- And the ridiculousness of how those scenes happened were unintentionally hilarious. The two main characters go to this bar or club or whatever it is. Sit down for about a minute. Literally, a minute. Then a beautiful girl comes up to them, out of the blue, full of seduction. Without any dialogue or conversation between the two, they cut to the scene where they're doing it. What??????????? What kind of club is this? And where can I find one? - Lack of action. Now I'm not a big explosion guy. I prefer witty dialogue and an intriguing story compared to noisy action scenes. But when you're dealing with a Jason Statham movie, you expect they're to be non-stop, off the wall fist fights and car cases. This movie fails to deliver. So much so, the first 40 minutes go by without any action at all. You can call it the 'set-up', but a movie like this should give the people what they came to see.- Jason Statham. Yes, I know I labeled him as one of the few decent qualities about this movie. But the fact is this actor has such a one note performance in every single one of his movies (at least that I've seen), it gets to the point where I can't take it. He talks quietly, has that mad look on his face, and always escapes the most dangerous of scenarios completely unharmed.- Ben Foster's character (or whatever his name was.) Didn't belong in the movie at all. Why in the world Statham's character would bring him on board as like a 'hitman's assistant' is never explained. Was it guilt? Was he to be his apprentice? Do I care? - Training results. Many, many, many, many action movies fall to this cliché. It's that only after a short and most likely useless training session (Ben Foster's character shoots shotgun shells at various targets in the woods) he becomes an untouchable killing machine. You're telling me this guy went from a drunk to a weapon in such a short amount of time like that? Hard to believe. . .- The Climax. I won't give it away (not like it would matter anyways) but the final battle has something to do with a large city. Car crashes, explosions, massive gunfire everywhere. But I thought Jason Statham's character was suppose to be this ninja-like assassin who moves in silence and covers up his footsteps? He's causing about as much destruction as you would see in any disaster movie. Did he just say 'screw it, I'm tired off playing it safe'? Conclusion: This movie is garbage. But, what more do you expect from a January movie? I originally gave it a 3/10, but when writing this review realized how bad it really was. So, here it is. My first 1/10 I've given a movie. Congrats!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I said I wasn't sure what to expect from this film I would be lying. Jason Statham as an elusive hit-man.....Yep that's pretty much the jist. However, I am a Statham fan and this has taken ingredients from old-school Action movies and converted them into a high octane and stylish film.The plot is slightly creaky and some aspects seem a little rushed but let's face it we didn't watch this film for breath taking performances and Oscar nominations. We watched it for cool,calm and collective 'Hit' sequences and action.Ben Foster is actually really good as the bad ass, young loose cannon although we don't find out a lot about his characters background. Statham is his usual type of character with an even more cold blooded edge. In summary, worth watching if like me you grew up on the action movies of the late 80's and 90's. Stylish cinematography in places with a good soundtrack. The film has not tried to go too main stream and has not steered away from graphic gore.Downside-predictable....but who cares!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Jason Statham Tour de Force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something akin to a guilty pleasure to watch bad guys get knocked off - DEXTER supplies that on television and now Jason Statham plays it on the screen. Yes, hit men or assassins or mechanics have been the subject matter of many films, but there is something about the manner in which the ultra virile yet heart of gold Arthur is brought to life by Statham that makes us root for his every move. John Lewis Carlino wrote the story and the screenplay for both this (with Richard Wenk) and the original 1972 version of THE MECHANIC and the 40 intervening years have not change the end results much. It still is a film with spiky dialogue and a good mixture of watching bad guys gradually get their deserts. Now it is Arthur (Jason Statham) who is the flawless, perfectionist, leave-no-mess-behind hit man that everyone in the assassination business wants to hire. His methods - the opening sequence as Arthur kills drug cartel leader Jorge Lara (James Logan) is as imaginative as actions such as these come - are impeccable. He is called upon to off an old colleague Harry McKenna (Donald Sutherland) which is a feat in and of itself, but soon after he meets up with McKenna's wild son Steve (Ben Foster) and gradually teaches the lost Steve the role of a mechanic. From then on it is fireworks with Arthur and Steve fulfilling jobs assigned to them by the smarmy Dean (Tony Goldman), with Steve finally taking on a job by himself - killing the bulky 6'7" Burke (Jeff Chase) during an assignation attempt. But things change when Steve realizes the relationship between his father's death and his new 'partner' and this leads to a finely choreographed surprise ending. Simon West knows how to stage action scenes and how to manipulate CGI realistically, and he allows his characters to be sidetracked by worthy wenches just to keep it real. Mark Isham delivers his usual powerpunch musical score (with frequent help from Schubert's Piano Trio No. 2 in E flat major - Arthur's tranquilizer. For those who like action films with strong lead characters this is a movie that will entertain well. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two of my favorite character actors in one movie, great title, "good story"!!! BUT, it was vanilla, bland-it really needed a familiar female love interest or something juicier than two women I didn't recognize. Tony Goldwyn as a villain, perfect, just not enough of him...then again, good storyline (not great). It's a movie you want to like, pulling for it, and I gave it 7 because of the main characters plus Donald Sutherland. Yes, the action sequences and an ending I didn't expect, but made up for some of the "falling asleep" middle. Also, this does resemble Transporter 3 (with Ben Foster)...speaking of Mr. Foster, he once again gets wasted with a character you like but don't know anything really about other than the obvious. Don't get my wrong the flick doesn't suck and is very rent able, I am just like everyone else (tired of vampires, super heroes and horrible remakes of the 80's)</fullReview>

In this time, just a waste of time...As a Jason Statham fan, i expect something better than this. He has such a charisma.

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but also watch the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Only minor spoilage here, I try not to give much away if you haven't seen it yet).I liked the movie, it was certainly entertaining. Statham seems to crank, or rather be cranked out in similar genres (in general action movies). Not bad, although I don't think he is the perfect fit for the role in this movie. As an actor great, but I think physically he's a bit small so doesn't make such an intimidating hit-man. At least not what I might expect in he genre/stereotype anyhow. Seems to me, after so many years of doing this the guy should be much older, have a bit more maturity to him, and be a bit like vintage wine. Also this movie was a big Jame's Bond'ish as he has some kind of impeccable sense of timing and luck. If you want an entertaining movie for your weekend, and you like action movies then give this one a shot.However if you didn't know already this is a remake of a 1972 version with Charles Bronson in the leading role. Bronson seems a lot better fit. He has a darker kind of mysterious look (which also made movies like "Once Upon a Time in the West", "Machine-Gun Kelly", etc).See both this version and the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mechanic isn't anything to get excited for, even for it's action.you can easily continue living your life without the fear of having missed out on a good movie because Mechanic has barely anything to offer.With a lame plot, lame acting, lame script and a very lame ending, the Mechanic is disappointing.Donald Sutherland was easily the best thing about this movie and he was just a minor character who got barely any screen time. Stratham is usually good in his action roles, but for some reason he even seemed lame in this particular movie.I recently watched a similar action movie, "Faster" starring the Rock, in my opinion, it had much better plot, acting and action to offer.The transporter franchises were enjoyable to watch, but not the Mechanic.I give it 4/10 for some good action scenes, but no where near sufficient for an "action" movie, and the rest for Sutherland.You can give this a miss unless you're dying of boredom and have nothing else to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched the movie yesterday at the cinema and was really very disappointed. I had hoped for a fast paced action movie with a clever story after reading some good reviews.Unfortunately the movie does not have a good story and is in addition unnecessary brutal. People are killed with hundreds of bullets. Others are beaten to death and you have to watch it in all details. The first half of the movie does not add much to the story and is rather slow paced.Over the last 30 minutes i hoped all the time that this bastard "heroes" of the movie would be brought to justice and eliminated.In general i would not recommend the movie to anyone, i think the time watching this movie can be spent much more fruitfully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so I had to use up my two remaining movie tickets before their expiry date. Silly Hoyts, they make you buy 10 tickets, but then you have to use them in no time at all. I only rated this movie a 4/10. It could have been higher, but the story reminded me of too many other movies (e.g. The Transporter and Bourne series). There's lots of action, and the acting isn't too bad either, but unfortunately everything is so predictable, including the predictable twist at the very end. I was again flabbergasted when a family came into the cinema with some young kids. I wonder what message these kids will be getting from this movie, but I bet it's something like "cool - let's become a hit-man and kill some people for lots of money, live in an expensive house and drive really fast cars". I guess some people don't understand the logic behind movie ratings and somehow seem to think that their children are somehow 'mature' enough to see and experience it all. Again, the movie isn't bad, but I have seen better stories around hit-man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so dull and predictable that it took me 7 days to watch it. The first time i saw it, I was snoring after 40 minutes and i spent the next two days wondering whether to watch it again or not. Finally, I decided to give it a try and continued from where I last remembered sleeping off. Another 20 minutes and I was bored to another sound sleep. Well I must actually thank them for making such a sedative of a flick that too with Statham in it. And it was due to respect for this man that after 7 days, I finally had the courage to finish it off. But never again am I going to watch a flick just 'cause Mr.Statham is in it. If still you are wondering about the quality of this movie then i will sum it up in these simple words. Take any transporter movie and subtract the cars, the fun, the banter, the script, the characters and everything else you loved about them and you have seen this movie.Q. was this movie produced and directed by a society of Stuntmen..cause that would explain why the only thing good in it are the action sequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How do you like another "Statham-is-superior-badass" movie? Yeah... me too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course, there is a lot worse movies, for example Green Hornet, but this one is awfully boring as well.What's the plot? To cut a long story short: Statham prepare an assassination with Foster, and Foster, of course, f*cked-up. I can't stand Statham and his expression: always the same in all his movies. He should demonstrate muscles, I know, but he can't handle even with it. The script is just to obvious, too predictable to enjoy this story. Even the action scenes are dull. But the worst thing, maybe one of the worse in cinematography of last years is this: Statham go back home after work, and with his gloomy face turn on music. And guess what? It's Classical music! Don't get me wrong, i like classic, but when somebody try to make me believe that Statham likes it too... I don't understand how it's possible to find something interesting in story about character as shallow and one-dimensional as Bishop (Statham). Ben Foster character is even more irritating: in one scene he fight with professional killer, who is 3-times (literally!) bigger then Foster. And our hero win, he kills this pile of muscles with his bare hands. Give me a break!It makes me sad to think of the money producers waste for so uninteresting and simply stupid movie. My advice: just skip it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, the 'Mechanic' isn't very deep or complex, but it does deliver. You have your likable hit-man, some drama, some contracts and endgame. It's not to be taken seriously though... for example, police simply does not exist in this movie. You have 2 killers blowing up a street, a gas station, leaving blood and fingerprints all over the crime scenes, never wearing gloves, dropping people onto street from high-rise building... list goes on.But what's good about it is that all is played out in intense and exciting way, and that's what you expect when picking an action movie, right? Statham plays his ages old role of being bald, grumpy and superhuman, while other guy brings casual human being to the overall set. Even Statham's role justifies 100 minutes well, if you liked Transporter series, Crank, or any other movie of him starring, you get no less.Never seen the original, but I rather enjoyed this movie. It's no movie of the year, but I don't get highly negative ratings given to 'Mechanic'. What the hell did you expect? And why? Just watch it for what it is and don't complain about what it isn't... and never intended to be!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Kick-ass movie with Statham</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me put something straight...I am a great fan of Statham's. I have enjoyed each of his movies, including ''War'' which more or less impressed me, and Crank 2 which basically looks like a disorganized and badly edited movie. Whether it's in Death Race, The Transporter(s), The Expendables, Crank, or any other movie with him in it, it's always awesome to see Statham kicking-ass. The Mechanic is no exception, for it offers a more constructive narrative than most of his other movies, but still offers plenty of action to satisfy any person expecting an action flick. I even saw it twice in theatres, though the second time doesn't really count, for my friend and I switched auditoriums because The Roommate sucked too badly.The Mechanic is, for the most part, pretty intelligent. With the exception of it's brain-dead ending, it's story is actually pretty brilliant over all (yes, I am aware it's a re-make). What makes it so brilliant is how Bishop is always ready for something unexpected to happen, and how he does prepare himself to never get caught unexpectedly. I thought the acting was okay. The Cast know they're not making an Oscar-worthy film. Statham is at his usual self, but Ben Foster literally surprised me. Having seen only a bit of overacting from him in Alpha Dog, I was surprised by how not shabby his acting was. There's one scene in particular near the end, where he questions Bishop about his father's murder (after finding out by himself Bishop was the murderer). The emotion is there, in his face and in his eyes. Sure, I know he won't be nominated at the Oscars, but it was a strong performance indeed.So the Mechanic is pretty much a story about a skilled hit-man named Arthur Bishop (Statham), who is extremely skilled. After a mission that made him kill his best friend, Bishop teaches his skills to the dead man's son, who, in return, tries to find who his father's killer is. THe film itself is brilliant, relying on killing techniques I would never have thought of. The way Arthur plans his missions and all the twists made sure to not let your brain off during the viewing, and the only problem I had was with the brain dead ending. First, no cops intervene in their fight. Next, you get Statham rolling out of a sudden death (those who have seen know what I mean). Killing Statham would have made much more dramatic effect, but I guess this is Statham after all.All in all, I saw it twice in theatres, and I believe this film is worth watching. Great popcorn flick. Surely will buy this movie when it comes out on DVD/Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director Simon West does a much better job then the original's director Gus Van Sant did!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantastic re-telling of the 1972 original starring Charles Bronson as the lead original character Arthur Bishop. only this time this is re told with much more flare and panache which makes it 10 times more cooler then the original. That's what i like, if you are going to redo a classic flick then you better make sure you add your own twist to the tale 'cause let me tell you, nothing is worse then watching a word for word remake for eg; Gus Van Sant's 1998 remake of the original horror classic by Alfred Hitchcock 'Psycho'. Add your own little creative edge to it and i will for sure want to pay money to see it! Arthur Bishop is played with great tenacity by our action hero of today Jason Statham. And the story here is this; after Bishop ( a hired killer ) gets told this his next assignment just happens to be his mentor for many years Harry Mckenna (Donald Sutherland ) he completes the job and during the funeral he meets up with Harry's son Steve (played by the always awesome and intense Ben Foster) Steve pleas with Bishop to take him under his wing so to speak and show him the ropes of contracted killing, so they together can find his father's assassins and take them out! Bishop knows right well who is responsible for the killing but in case of Steve doing something incredibly stupid, he takes him in just basically to keep an eye on him. This leads to the pair taking on a series of hits together all the whilst keeping this secret from Steve. A great action thriller that i was really impressed on how it captivated me from start to finish. Director Simon West did a fantastic job of re-telling Van Sant's original script with adding loads of his own touches to the film which makes it look more of his own then Van Sants.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem i have with this movie that is doesn't have an interesting story. A "brilliant" assassin has to kill a close friend because he is made to believe that this friend, who works for the same company, is a traitor. After the killing he is training the son of his now dead friend to become an assassin and they do some killings together. And that's what happens in the rest of the movie. But it doesn't get interesting. It's more like "oh, i have to do a killing, let's do it together..." Everyone in this movie seems to know where Statham a.k.a Arthur Bishop is living and what he is doing for a living and he doesn't seem to care. For an assassin this doesn't make any sense. Statham plays the same role as in any other movie he is in. It seems like he is not capable of any other facial expression than "cool". Ben Foster is a waste of talent for this boring movie.He is good actor.It's one of those "watch it and forget it" movies. Even if you have nothing else to do don't waste your time with this one. It's like watching the weather channel. I gave it a 2 because the overall 6.5 is way to high. 3.5 is more suitable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Mechanic" kicks off 2011 with the first legitimate action frenzy of the year starring none other than the 21st century action king himself, Jason Statham. His action repertoire ranges back to 200 "The Italian Job" remake to the trilogy that made him famous, "Transporter" and won him a spot in the 2010 action smash hit "The Expendables" among the great action heroes of all time. With this being said, "The Mechanic" was a film with no other purpose than putting Statham in the spotlight. He reprises his generic role as an elite hit-man named Arthur Bishop working as a "mechanic" for a top-secret assassination company. What is a mechanic? Does he just fix up cars and other vehicles? No a mechanic is defined a little differently in this film. Mechanics are people who are specially trained, paid killers who are taught how to kill people and make it look like an accident. The film revolves around Bishop getting a murder assignment targeting an alleged friend in the film named Harry McKenna (Donald Sutherland). After briefly wrestling with the idea of killing him he follows the company's orders once again by murdering him in a way to make it look like a car jacker had killed him. Shortly after he meets and befriends Harry's son Steve McKenna played by Ben Foster ("The Messenger") and without revealing his secret he takes him as his apprentice in the art of the mechanic. Along the way secrets behind the aforementioned murder are revealed leading these two to seek revenge on the company, while Bishop strives to keep his secret about Steve's father hidden.Ben Foster has a decent performance in the film for having to play a very one-dimensional character, however, he will be vastly overlooked because Jason Statham is the star. No matter how you look at it any film that Statham is in has entertainment written all over. The plot may be horrible and the other characters may all be one-dimensional and lack substance, but as long as Jason Statham is in the film it is going to be fun. The bottom line is Jason Statham is a badass. Enough said. Statham receives help from a very good soundtrack that tries to distinguish the film from the rest of the action flick genre. It sets a very interesting and unique tone to undermine the expectations of the otherwise cliché film.The film strays away from relying on Jason Statham's action skills and instead tries to focus too much on creating a mysterious thrilling plot instead of sticking to the basics of action movie delight. This results in a hit and miss plot that tries too hard to throw totally unnecessary twists and turns at the viewer as the film moves towards its inevitable foreseeable conclusion. The fact that the film does not accept that it isn't original only hurts the film by attempting to transform it into something that it isn't.In the end Jason Statham is on top as action star and does not lose any prestige with this slightly above average, lackluster action flick. Statham is at the point in his career where he can single handedly save a movie from complete failure. However, Statham's talents have grown far beyond the golden boy action hero and should bring him back to his "Italian Job" roots because films like "The Mechanic" are entertaining but not worth the hefty theatrical ticket price.</fullReview>

Yes it is an action movie but the original had some quality acting in it by Jan Michael Vincent and Charles Bronson who gave nuanced performances with a certain bonding of the two characters which this one does not. The problem is the leads who are not the best of actors and though i have seen Jason Statham in many flicks he is extremely wooden and has two facial expressions mad and madder and is best when he is not talking. After 2/3th of the way i was hoping for Jan Michael to show up with Airwolf blows these jokers away and with the spirit of the departed Charlie Bronson rewind this movie and put in the original lol.</fullReview>

The boom mic.The boom mic makes many appearances and makes them significant. He Sometimes drops in for a sec, or for about 10 seconds. While brief, it is many times. He sometimes is very steady, but most the time, he vibrates to show his location and impress everyone. The boom mic can completely steal the whole scene, or the whole show. His influence is next to godliness. He is truly inspired throughout this whole film and should be given the proper credit. Awards need do fly in the direction of the boom mic. His hard work has truly made The Mechanic (2011) rise beyond from the print shop and too new great heights. He is an inspiration to us all.In conclusion while The Mechanic (2011) fails on many levels, it at least has the boom mic to save it from being one of the worst movies of the year. The boom mic will continue to inspire us all. All be praised to the sacred boom mic. Amen.</fullReview>

Now call me old fashioned; but if I see a sign that says Jo Bloggs Comedian- if anyone is easily offended please do not attend and I fell into the bracket of easily offended, I wouldn't go. Similarly if I knew the comedian sounded just the same as every other comedian that is currently tapping the boards I wouldn't go. SO it beggars belief that someone says Jason Statham is rubbish and can't act and is one dimensional. SO why are you going to watch him, if you think he's so Great!! Then compare a film to one previously made some years ago with the late Charles Bronson and say it doesn't match up to that. You are already setting yourself up for a fall if you start comparing things. Let's value it as a film, is it entertaining? YES. Does it have a story line, you can follow and understand and get to grips with? YES Is there good action scenes . YES I found the cinematic experience a pleasurable one. Nothing outstanding, it won't be getting any Oscars, I know what to expect when I see Jason Statham and he never lets you down (I think WAR is his best movie- outstanding), Ben Foster plays a good part too and so the supporting cast fulfil there role. I was happy ate my popcorn and drank me Cola, had a big smile went home, Job done- Why people start dissecting it and finding that a paper clip was on a table one minute and not the next I think YOU ARE SAD! Just don't go if you hate Jason Stantham and if you don't like violence and the odd expletive, stay at home and watch the Untouchables or something. Otherwise go and be entertained it will not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Revenge holds the cup to the lips of another but drinks the dregs itself." Josh Billings Don't waste your time cruising the internet for porn because if you see The Mechanic, you'll have all you need: violence as porn that is. Jason Statham stars as a "mechanic" or hit man caught in a tangle of deceit and revenge coming right down the line from his place of employment.Statham,as Arthur Bishop, reprising the role of the granite Charles Bronson in 1972, is indisputably the star, even with partner pro-tem, Steve, being played by the very competent Ben Foster. Statham's scowl, punctuated by a slight smirk now and then, is the industry standard for good bad guy.Early in his career I saw Statham in a café at Sunset Plaza in Hollywood; I knew immediately the Transporter?-scruffy beard, balding dome, and signature scowl.The two hit men, not much like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (though when Statham and Foster jump from a building I couldn't help think of that romantic duo), are connected by the assassination of Steve's father (Donald Sutherland), who was also Bishop's mentor. After a series of barely connected set pieces of explosions and bullets, Steve is ready to deal with his dad's murderer, and Bishop is there to teach and corral the blood-thirsty avenger.Although I enjoy Jason Statham's screen persona, with the lack of originality and a plot even I figured out early on, I am merely amused by this film's formulaic violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mechanic (2011): Dir: Simon West / Cast: Jason Statham, Ben Foster, Donald Sutherland, Tony Goldwyn, Jeff Chase: The title fits its formula structure in this remake about the things that we can and cannot fix. Jason Statham plays a hired assassin whose methods involve murders that appear to be accidents. When he is put in position to kill his employer he is faced with training his son in the art of killing without suspicion. Director Simon West handles the action effectively with numerous explosions. He previously made the intelligent action thriller The General's Daughter as well as the unnecessary remake of When a Stranger Calls that absolutely no one asked for. Statham is fine in familiar ground. His assassin is smart but must deal with his latest victim due to the person's son and the betrayal. Ben Foster steals scenes as Statham's employer's son whose rage enables him to complete a task without obvious casualties. Statham prefers perfected conclusions without future disturbances, while Foster could care less as long as his anger is satisfied. The conclusion is hardly an applause when one factor must cancel out another. Supporting roles are an unfortunate mix of bland writing and actors worthy of better material. Donald Sutherland is wasted as Statham's wheelchair bound boss whom he is betrayed into killing. Tony Goldwyn has the unfortunate job of portraying the cardboard villain who will get his in the end. Pointless action farce that is more about exploiting mindless violence as oppose to dealing with the nature of it. In the end it is a mechanic malfunction. Score: 4 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why a Remake?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because, as with Everest, they can. I approached 2011's The Mechanic with the mindset that it would suck, but I would be fair-minded and accept its suckage with grace.I have a great deal of affection for Michael Winner's 1972 original, despite all its flaws and Winnerisms. Charles Bronson oozed an early 70s action-star ethos and Jan-Michael Vincent was a truly-appealing, sociopathic apprentice. Even the director, an artsy-fartsy hack whose best work seemed to come from him stumbling upon it (and Bronson picking him up and brushing him off) couldn't gum it up too badly.Flash forward to 2011, and sure enough, Hollyshouldn't did. The remake probably got done because of the strength of the basic story, and Simon West stays fairly faithful to it.Yet, we live in unpleasant times, ones that make 1972 look simple and quaint. So, enter the special effects guys and gals, ready to fill a remake with two almost-completely unappealing stars, Jason Statham and Ben Foster, a change of venue (NO, not LA), exploding head-shots, sex, drugs, and the head bad guy--Statham's boss--being a corporate slimer instead of a mafioso. Pack it altogether and you've got a perfectly serviceable modern gore-fest.Which begs the question--did I like it? Yeah, I think I did. I have no idea why Statham is a star (abs simply don't make a performer,anymore than boobs), and I don't even know Ben Foster. The guy who plays the head suit is the same dude--Tony Goldwyn?--who got Patrick Swayze killed in Ghost--yet another typecast actor who's probably a Buddhist pacifist in real-life, but doesn't mind the work. Donald Sutherland once again gets killed off. You would think he would have learned to have a human shield around him after The Italian Job. Sheesh!The Mechanic just isn't bad on its own. It's gory, and I want to stop here to thank USA Network for leaving much of the violence in, muting the cuss words, and pixelating the boobs and butts instead of shredding it for broadcast. I actually find that less intrusive than the looping and lopping you usually have to contend with when watching a movie on TV.After it was over, I was essentially pleased with taking the time to watch The Mechanic. It isn't the original, nor should it be compared. We live in the twenty-teens, not the nineteen-seventies. Even though West's version seems bland, it kept my attention. The ending was predictably different, and there was no wad of wax being squeezed by Statham.He seems so one-dimensional, I fear he wouldn't have been able to deliver his lines while having either of his hands masticating a ball of melted candle goo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't followed Statham's exploits, but expected this to be much worse.It isn't very good even in its milieu, but why it was passable for me is because there is a pretty loose structure, the film is simply not bogged down to an 'epic' trajectory?a superspy guy (a 'mechanic') trains a younger one as possible replacement, there are two preparatory missions, the 'big job' which is not that big in the end, and it goes on to a fatalistic confrontation between the two.The whole background of the killing business is pretty ridiculous, but the action is half-decent and Statham looks pensive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to do this the other way around, but when I ordered the film up through my local library, I got the Jason Statham remake instead of the Bronson original. Not that big a deal I guess. I was up for some action entertainment tonight without too much thought required so this fit the bill OK. But take away a point for credibility when Ben Foster's character transforms from an alcoholic flunkie into an elite assassin in just a couple of short training sessions. I don't care how good a mentor Harry (Donald Sutherland) was to Bishop (Statham), the kid was bad news right from the get go. Taking on that six foot seven gorilla was just a bad idea no matter how you slice it. Best original move of the picture was that opening sequence when Bishop did the swimming pool hit. However anyone who thought Bishop was a goner when Steve blew the car hasn't seen enough of these flicks. All the rest was straight shoot 'em up but unrealistically impossible action. I still want to see Bronson do it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>http://gingermoviereviews.blogspot.com Ahhhh - Jason Statham - He is such an awesome bad ass action movie guy. And he's totally hot. Really really really hot. I greatly valued seeing him with his shirt off in the movie.The actual movie was okay. I wouldn't say it isn't worth seeing, but it's definitely not high on the list of movies you MUST see. The pace of the movie seemed to drag a bit in certain places. There were some really good action sequences though. It was fantastic to see a car just drive into the back of a bus.It was a predictable movie. More so than it should have been. The movie opens with a pool scene that you can fully expect the expected. There weren't a lot of surprises. I think it could have been better with a bit of twists here and there. For some reason, Jason Statham and Donald Sutherland work well in movies together. I wish Donald had a bigger role though - it was like 'The Italian Job' - he wasn't in the movie much. If you're looking for something to watch and have seen most of the movies you want to see, pick this one up. If you're a Jason Statham fan, SEE IT ASAP!Favorite Scene: The cemetery - the production design and music worked well in this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What would you do for revenge? After both losing someone close to them Bishop (Statham) and Steve (Foster) begin the hunt for revenge. When secrets are revealed the stakes get higher. After watching the original a few days ago I knew a little about what to expect with this one. Statham is a very lethal assassin that specializes in "accident-like" killings. When his boss gives him a target he doesn't agree with he begins to uncover a web of lies that changes the way he thinks. This was a pretty typical action movie. A little like "The Transporter" mixed with "Assassins". I was hoping for a better movie, but was not disappointed. Very entertaining with a few slow parts. Not bad, but could have been better. About as good as the original, the ending in the original I liked better though. I give it a B.Would I watch again? - If it was on TV I may watch a little of it.*Also try - Game Of Death &amp; The Mechanic (Original)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film as long as you remain detached from the plot like Arthur does with his victims</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨Victory comes with preparation.¨ The Mechanic is a remake of a 1972 film of the same name staring Charles Bronson in another of his infamous revenge movies. Bronson made at least a dozen of those flicks. I never saw the original one, but I didn't have to because I've seen several films like The Mechanic, action packed and dealing with revenge. Jason Statham was the right choice to play the role Bronson once played in the 70's since in a way he is becoming the Bronson of our generation. Statham has made several films like The Mechanic in the past, The Transporter being perhaps one of his best roles to date. Statham might not be one of the most talented actors in the industry, but he is good at action. He seems to be playing pretty much the same role in all his movies (the tough guy act), but given the right script his films can be entertaining. The script was originally written by Lewis John Carlino for the original Mechanic, and it was adapted by Richard Wenk (16 Blocks) for this newer version. The Mechanic is directed by Simon West, the guy who brought us Con Air, and he's been around action films for a while. This probably won't rank among his best works, but The Mechanic still manages to entertain with all its twist (some more predictable than others), and nonstop action scenes. The Mechanic is a very violent film; it has a lot of blood and raw scenes. The problem with the film is that we've seen this sort of action movie in the past, but Statham still makes it worthwhile.Jason Statham is Arthur Bishop, a ¨mechanic¨, in other words a hit-man, or an elite assassin (whichever you prefer to call it), and he's one of the best in his field. He's quiet, professional, and remains unattached to his victims. He receives his targets via an internet add sent to him by his boss Dean (Tony Goldwyn) and prepares for each job in his quiet bayou, which serves as his hideout. Arthur is a perfectionist, he studies every detail about his victims and if he can he carries the job out as silently as possible. Sometimes you never even know he was there, making the murders appear as natural deaths. Arthur is troubled when he receives his next target because it is Harry McKenna (Donald Sutherland), his friend and the man who taught him everything about being a mechanic. Apparently Harry has betrayed the company and sold out some of the other mechanics. Arthur follows through with his assignment, but when Harry's son, Steve (Ben Foster), wants Arthur to teach him everything he knows about being a hit-man the situation becomes complicated. Arthur has a strict code, he's a perfectionist, and likes to eliminate his targets as clean as possible, but Steve is more volatile and likes to get dirty. Arthur tries to teach Steve how to remain detached from his victims, but things begin to get messy. The situation gets worse when Arthur discovers that he was set up and that Harry never had betrayed the company, it was the other way around. It's time for Arthur to send his company a message for fooling with him.I really liked the opening scene of the film, I thought Arthur's first assignment was well thought out and it helped establish his character. He did his job quietly and clean, and then he headed to his hideout, turned on some classical music and got rid of all the evidence like if nothing had ever happened. The Mechanic begins with clean kills, but then it becomes increasingly more violent as the film progresses. Then the twists begin showing up and several plot holes can be found, but they are numbed down by all the violence. As long as the viewer remains detached to the plot, like Arthur is detached to his victims, then they will have a good time with this action packed film, but if they sit down and analyze it scene by scene then it probably won't be very entertaining at all. The Mechanic isn't a great film, but it still is entertaining thanks to Statham and Foster who are great in the action scenes. It's far from being memorable and I probably won't be seeing it anytime soon, but it's still worth a onetime viewing. This isn't among Statham best films (like Bank Job, or his collaborations with Guy Ritchie), but it is still better than most of his recent movies. Foster and Statham form a deadly partnership and make this movie worth the while. In summary, The Mechanic is a forgettable, but entertaining film.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than I expected, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a great lover of Charles Bronson's seventies flicks, but not the eighties ones, those he made with the infamous Golan Globus Cannon Group productions - the 80's Sam Katzman. No, only the seventies, and of course THE MECHANIC was one of his best ever. Bronson and Michael Winner worked often together: CHATO'S LAND, DEATH WISH 1, 2 and 3, STONE KILLER, and some other Cannon Group crap...Back to this remake, I must admit that I expected far worse than this. The story is nearly exactly the same, except the very ending, some other IMDb users have already spoiled. The characters and the relations between the two of them are interesting, far more than I was afraid of. Statham gives here is best performance since a long time; probably ever. The young killer character is also more fascinating than Statham's one. Really, that's not a masterpiece, but I like it very much. But, I repeat, it's not flawless; and it could have been better, especially concerning the ending. I was here disappointed. Too American for me, and I guess Statham wanted it this way. But maybe I am wrong.One thing surprised me in the other users' comments.NO ONE has mentioned Richard Donner's ASSASSINS - 1995 - starring Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Banderas. It was nearly the same topic - Stallone as the "old killer" and Banderas...But it was a really bad movie compared to the two MECHANICS...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another non-stop action hit with Jason Statham. His name alone equals adrenaline-filled and fast-pumped action. And "The Mechanic" is no exception. Action from start till end.The storyline in "The Mechanic" is very interesting and you quickly get swept up in it and the story keeps you nailed to the seat until the movie ends. There isn't a lot of twists and surprises, but still, the movie managed to come out with a rather good end result.On the cast list are names like Jason Statham (playing Arthur Bishop) duh! And he really is in his ace in a movie like this. Donald Sutherland (playing Harry McKenna) also had a role in the movie, although a fairly small role. I think it was a shame that Sutherland didn't have a longer role and more screen time in this movie. Tony Goldwyn (playing Dean) was really well cast for this particular role; there is just something scheming and secretive about him. Ben Foster (playing Steve McKenna) also did a really good job with his role. And it was a treat to see Jeff Chase (playing Burke) in the role that he had.The movie is filled with action, fighting, speed and thrills from the beginning and up till the very end. And this is what we have come to expect when we see Jason Statham's name billed on a movie poster or cover."The Mechanic" is a movie that has enough value to be watched more than once, and I do believe that I will be making another return to it sometime down the line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'THE MECHANIC': Four Stars (Out of Five) The latest Jason Statham action film, this one is a remake of a 1972 Charles Bronson flick about a veteran hit-man looking to retire (of course). Ben Foster co-stars as an apprentice that Statham's character takes on before calling it quits. The film is directed by Simon West (director of such popular B action films as 'CON AIR' and 'LAURA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER') and written by Richard Wenk and Lewis John Carlino (who also penned the original). The film is far more impressive, at least stylistically speaking, than West's previous efforts. I haven't seen the original but I found this remake to be extremely entertaining and well done.Statham plays Arthur Bishop, an assassin who's an expert at making people disappear. He's flawless at making his murders look like accidents or other acts of random violence. When his friend and old mentor Harry (Donald Sutherland) is killed he has trouble moving on and is ready to close shop. Then Harry's son Steve (Foster) comes into his life, obsessed with revenge. Bishop decides to take Steve under his wing and teach him everything he knows. The two become an odd team taking out targets for Bishop's employers. Then when new evidence surfaces implicating those ultimately responsible for Harry's death the two put their new found team to the test.The film is very dark and gloomy, it's not the 'fun' action film some Statham fans are used to. It's brutally violent and devoid of almost any emotion. The lead characters are the epitome of the flawed anti hero and they're definitely not 'good guys'. Statham and Foster are both excellent in their roles and make for a pretty cool action team. The supporting cast is all fitting, including Tony Goldwyn as a villain, and the writing and directing are impressive for this type of film as well. There's a few dark twists, some of which come pretty early on, and as I mentioned before this is quite a bit more polished and satisfactory than West's other work. I wasn't expecting a lot and therefore was pretty pleasantly surprised. If you like tough action films you're bound to enjoy this.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS7EjRs-tOE</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The MechanicBusiness is business that is the code that Jason Statham goes by, in this action pack action pack tense thriller Directed by Simon west (con air Lara croft). He plays Arthur Bishop a Butt kicking takes no prisoner mechanic/hit man in this 92 minute adaption of the 1972 version that stared Charles Bronson. This also stars Ben foster (30 days of night, 3:10 to Yuma) and Donald Sutherland (Mash, the Italian job and ordinary people)Jason (Arthur) plays a well oiled machine according to his long time mentor and friend Harry McKenna (Donald Sutherland). After one of their regular meetings Arthur is contacted by harry's partner for a assignment. When he goes to meet he tells him the job is harry. Arthur is kind of reluctant because of his history harry, but takes it because business is business. Arthur set up harry in the parking garage of his building. During the conversation he gives Arthur a gun with the saying victory is preparation (keep that quote in mind when you see the movie). Arthur decided to take in Harry's alcoholic jaded son Steve (Ben foster) in the way of the mechanic, after seeing how angry he is over his father death. Jason and Ben have Good on screen chemistry as hit man and apprentice. One of Steve's training sessions involved going to a kennel to adopt a dog. While having a conversation telling Steve what he needs to do Steve tells him you nothing about me. Arthur proceeds to rattle off Steve whole life story in 30 seconds Steve's jaw just dropped. Jason shows some good acting chops in a few scenes with Mr. Sutherland. They had a scene in a dinner talking business and Arthur getting his payment for services render. Harry talks about how Arthur needs to get some companionship once awhile. While in a parking garage Donald discuss about how he understands business is business and didn't want to go out like a pussy, and talked about where he got the gun he had Arthur use on him.This movie works well because of his take on the role of a mechanic; his very serious unshaven look fits the bill for this thriller. I though the directing was exceptional a lot of good action scenes especially towards the end. The use of New Orleans as back drop for the story seemed like an excellent fit. The use of various cars, buses and garbage trucks make for a wild scene when Arthur takes Steve on a big mission. These performances all around in this movie all around was exceptional Jason looked right at home as hit man. Ben foster is rising star in Hollywood, and Mr. Sutherland just adds old time Hollywood class to this well done action drama. A good mechanic treats every assignment and explanation as business is business. I would say make it your business to go see the mechanic. I give it 2 1/2 stars.My link is http://thehollywoodreview.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An okay professional hit men movie, not bad but nothing special either.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) is a 'mechanic' - an elite assassin with a strict code and unique talent for cleanly eliminating targets. It's a job that requires professional perfection and total detachment, and Bishop is the best in the business. But when his mentor and close friend Harry (Donald Sutherland) is murdered, Bishop is anything but detached. His next assignment is self-imposed - he wants those responsible dead. His mission grows complicated when Harry's son Steve (Ben Foster) approaches him with the same vengeful goal and a determination to learn Bishop's trade. Bishop has always acted alone but he can't turn his back on Harry's son. A methodical hit man takes an impulsive student deep into his world and a deadly partnership is born. But while in pursuit of their ultimate mark, deceptions threaten to surface and those hired to fix problems become problems themselves.this movie i was seriously not waiting for it to come and than i will see it, not a Statham fan. did not had any expectations from it but when i saw it i liked it a little bit. i mean it is not a great movie but not bad either. its better than some of the movies of past 2 years, the low budget low profiled one, like last years like say for example FASTER, last year movie which was a bad movie. don't make your expectations too high though.this movie has some good action and fight scenes, over the top explosive action with guns and bullets. the movie is nothing special but the action scenes are intense. story is OK, plot could have been tighter and more interesting, first half is kind of boring and empty. direction was OK, not bad but needed some more work. movie seems stylish in a strange way. characters are clichéd.i can't really talk about acting i mean you know how that would be. it is average or below average. Jason Statham looks good, but he is doing all these same movies with same storyline and same character. i mean that seriously sucks. Ben Foster though was good and they looked good together. but i will say that they never needed to remake that old movie. they ruined it and it is now a typical action film with nothing special. ruined. not on the whole but slightly entertaining. for Jason Statham and these type of typical action thriller fans, watch it.</fullReview>

My one problem with him is his accent. He's English, a cockney no less. So rather than flitting between English and and bad American accents lets just stick to your natural voice.Ben Foster plays a strong role as Stathams trainee/sidekick. I'm just so surprised how he got from grieving son to deadly killer in such a short space of time.As far as the plot and the film go, i enjoyed it. I had visions of a Leon remake but it was far more than that. Much more action than Leon and less pondering. I love Leon but this movie doesn't really compare in that respect. It's better than the Transporter series of movies and it shows that Statham is growing as an actor.All in all a good film and i would highly recommend it.Enjoy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason Statham and that plonker Rodney in a Ronseal movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many years ago (well, 30-odd) Charles Bronson, then one of the major box-office draws in the world, made a movie called The Mechanic in which he was a paid assassin training up an enthusiastic wannabe, played by Jan-Michael Vincent.For Bronson, read Jason Statham and for Vincent, read Ben Foster. Apart from a couple of wrinkles the story stays more or less the same, including (more or less) the ending. But expect a lot more violence, blood, and bad language. In fact, it is so sadistically violent (though not excessively graphically so) that I am surprised that it retained a 15 certificate in the UK, especially when you consider that there is also a nude sex scene in it.I suppose, in fairness, I should report that this is an absolutely bog-standard action crime thriller - it does exactly what it says on the tin, and Staham adds another entry to his list of hard-man protagonists (he does one thing, and he does it well).My big problem is with Ben Foster, who seems to be aiming to make a career out of action/hard men protagonists. I'm afraid I can't take him seriously. Not only is he of diminutive stature (which, I accept, never stopped Tom Cruise) but, without the facial hair which he sports throughout The Mechanic, he looks uncannily like Nicholas Lyndhurst, a British character actor whose long-running character is a gormless twit. Here we have a gormless twit shortarse, and it just doesn't work for me, I'm afraid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A friend sort of dragged me to see this movie, and I expected to hate it. I figured it would be over the top violent, implausible, with impossibly clever "superman" killers...It was all that, but I sort of enjoyed it anyway. I think it was because the acting was pretty decent, and the film made it almost possible to imagine a shadowy organization in the business of killing people who needed to be killed. Don't get me wrong, most the the action scenes were impossibly complex and anything but believable. However, if you can "suspend disbelief" it is a fairly enjoyable action movie.It was noteworthy that in some places the film added a bit of "humanity" to the lives being lost. The victims of the killers were not necessarily impossibly evil sub-humans (well, maybe one was), they were just persons who for whatever reason those in power wanted dead. So maybe I liked the fact that the film had slightly more depth than most movies of this genre.And, there was a lot of action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Statham Shows His Hard Edge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One jumps to the obvious conclusion how this movie is going to play out . Starring Jason Statham who has made a career with in tongue in cheek heist or action adventure movies one would have expected more of the same . Based upon an action thriller from the 1970s originally directed by Michael Winner before he became better known as a restaurant critic THE MECHANIC surpasses all expectations from a Statham star vehicle and it's up to the individual if this is a good thing or a bad thing The original itself was no great shakes telling as it does a tale of a cold hearted and all too effective assassin showing a new kid on the block all the tricks of the trade . Despite being simplistic and low brow it was probably one of Bronson's better films . Here in this remake the structure and feel of the original still remains while at the same time does retain the look of what you're expecting from a Statham movie all the way down to the cinematography having having a yellowish / orange tint and the action scenes being shot in quick edits and close up . There is a major stylistic difference and that is the violence is very mean and brutal . Statham's character Arthur Bishop and his violent understudy Steve McKenna are not afraid to dispatch their targets in a series of violent and cruel ways . You are left with the impression that these hit men enjoy their work a little bit too much to elicit any empathy for them . Likewise the story feels it merely exists to show one graphic dispatch after the other . That said the cold and cruel tone of the film probably works in its favour . Some of the stunts and set-pieces might appear outlandish but the lack of humour stops your attention being drawn as to how unrealistic they may appear in practise , so in some ways this could have ended up being a Roger Moore type James Bond villain but the mean spirited touch means it's more like one featuring Sean Connery , Timothy Dalton or Daniel Craig</fullReview>

People seem to be deliberately searching for flaws instead of trying to enjoy this effort, which is rather hard to fault. There is nothing wrong with the acting, the action scenes are outrageously entertaining and well done, and Statham is what you would expect - ripped. I did wonder a few times about fingerprints, but that apparent blooper is minimal in the overall flow of the movie. Also you might wonder why they get away with many things in broad daylight - try this in the UK and everything would be on camera. ANYWAY forget all that and enjoy what really is a fine action movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Mechanic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Statham has taken on a variety of action roles in his career, equally adept at playing good character roles, evil ones, or anti-heroes. With a vast on screen profession ranging from being The Transporter to one of The Expendables, involved in a Death Race, or working on The Bank Job, and even The Italian Job too, he now becomes The Mechanic. No, not one who works in a garage, but an underground slang for a professional hit-man, and like many of his characters, he's the best of the best at what he does.His modus operandi is to be as meticulous as possible, preferring to stage his kills as accidents that his victims would have seemed to experience, working for an unnamed company who pays good, and has a clientele engaging it to bump off anyone from traffickers to bogus religious preachers. A remake of the 1972 of the same name starring Charles Bronson, this updated one directed by Simon West and written by Richard Wenk and Lewis John Carlino (who also scripted the original) relies heavily on conveniences for the primary character to work. Don't mind me saying, but what I thought was obviously missing here is the element of suspense. Even if you've not been exposed to the original, you are able to keep pace, and go steps ahead even, with how the story progresses, with Statham's Arthur Bishop instructed by his corporation to bump off long time handler Harry McKenna (Donald Sutherland), which of course presents itself as some moral and emotional dilemma, coupled with tremendous guilt that Bishop has to bear. A chance for redemption comes in the form of Harry's son Steve (Ben Foster), who gets taken in by Bishop and trained in the ways of his world, where every man has a price on his head, and only with meticulous planning in crafting a hit comes the opportunity to benefit.To an audience, you'll be waiting for when Steve would find out who had actually bumped off his dad, and leave him in the state that he is. Ben Foster excels here in the drama as a man reckless to get into fights, and approaching danger like a mouse to open cheese, diving headlong and not heeding instructions, just so to get a high from beating up and getting beaten up. Becoming almost like a liability, the development here is that he becomes almost like the professional he's trained to be, and is the consummate Robin type of sidekick to Bishop's Batman, responsible for screw ups that allow the action sequences to be spiced up.Action wise, this film is a mixed bag. Jason Statham's Bishop prefers being low key, so you don't get to see much of Statham getting all physical, and even when he does, it's a pity that Simon West has an issue with framing and filming it properly. Sure he's fast, but filming it into a blur doesn't help. Things improve with the bigger action sequences and thankfully the final big bang piece when they go up against Dean (Tony Goldwyn) and his posse, though short as they were, and so conveniently planned out that our anti-heroes don't even break into a sweat, only of course to highlight the key message in the film that victory favours the prepared.While emoting just isn't Statham's forte, he still struts around in coolness, and the only interesting thing about Bishop is his dilemma in wanting to redeem the wrong he had done against an old friend, and the playing of fire with accepting and training Steve McKenna as his own. Like how master-protégé relationships turn when it sours, this one wasn't really that much of an impact, and provided what I thought was the mother of all laughs in the film. There are always how far fetched a scenario can be, and this one bordered on the unintentionally comical, just you know, to want to wrap things up in a hurry. This mechanic at best delivers only a mediocre service.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thankfully Not in Desperate Need of a Full Overhaul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes (loose or direct) are never inherently bad simply because they belong to that classification, but usually the updated product is simply lazy and bland. Said lack of inspiration obviously has direct links to the fact the new product is based upon past material, but a premise is a premise, not a movie, and if handled correctly a remake can be as original as the filmmaker's agile mind desires.The Mechanic, a relook (let's call it) at the 1972 Charles Bronson hit-man thriller, falls squarely in the middle of proverbial road. The stars do their jobs with aplomb, there are some crisp one-liners, and the blood flows freely. Jason Statham has proved himself an infinitely reliable action staple, and even though his steadily moderate box office receipts have not yet given him the chance to play with the big boys, he is one of the closest things we have to a bonafide action hero these days.When the bullets fly in The Mechanic, the movie is fantastic. Sadly, though, it seems director Simon West (Con Air, Laura Croft: Tomb Raiser) could have used a bigger clip. The down times breaching the action scenes are just that, down times, and though Statham and his co-star Ben Foster's collective burning gaze and discussions on morality and death inch us along to palatable effect, I wanted more bang-bang and less yack-yack.There are three main raucous, gory set pieces initiated by hit men (or "Mechanics" if you will) Arthur Bishop (Statham) and Steve McKenna (Foster) and they deliver on everything you could want from a mindless action romp. The first is during McKenna's first solo hit, which is reminiscent of James Bond's inaugural job in Casino Royale or Kick-Ass's premiere attempt to right some wrongs which, collectively go far from smoothly. The second is a team convert assassination turned lead-laden smack-down in a high rise and finally we have the inevitable final confrontation against the forces to be. These sequences are why you would see The Mechanic. McKenna is the son of Bishop's former boss (and company head played by Donald Sutherland) which the latter had the unpleasant task of dispatching on direct orders for suspicion of betrayal. He takes the troubled young man under his guidance, partly out of loneliness as demanded by his profession and partly out of guilt, all the while a more complex conspiracy unfurls. As I previously iterated, both leads are very solid, I would say especially Foster who is one of those interesting character actors incapable of putting forth a dull effort.The more complex underlinings of the story seem to beg for a more cerebral punch (a la The American), but the jarring cuts from assassinations to exposition left me literally confused, an experience I do not find myself a part of at the movies much anymore. After gradually getting up to speed as the conclusion rolled around you begin to see the inevitable fate of certain characters -- or so I thought. The entire climatic act seemed reversed, as if pages of the script had been placed in the wrong order and the preceding acts and story arcs suffered as a result of the botched wrap-up.The Mechanic is your average Jason Statham movie (take that comment any way you like), better than War and a number of the "Transporter" films though still a far cry from his wildly enjoyable debuts and journeys back to British cinema. As for hit men films, this entry in the genre could have benefited from a few new parts, but is certainly not in desperate need of a full overhaul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Then You Might Expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mechanic, The (2011)** 1/2 (out of 4) Remake of the 1972 Charles Bronson film finds Jason Statham taking over the role of a hit-man who takes a young troubled kid (Ben Foster) under his wing. Soon the hit men finds themselves double crossed and they must try and take out to other bad guys. I really wasn't too sure what to expect from this film as I haven't seen too many Statham films and plus you never know how these remakes are going to go. On the whole I thought THE MECHANIC was entertaining enough as long as you're willing to turn the brain off during the final thirty-minutes. I was surprised to see how serious the first portion of the film was. While it certainly isn't as deep or well-made as the 1972 film it at least tries to be somewhat serious and especially early on when Statham must take out an old friend (Donald Sutherland). I found the conversation between the two men to be handled quite well and it certainly raised the value a little. The action scenes are all pretty good as long as you don't mind CGI blood and the fast paced editing. As you'd expect there are all sorts of shoot outs, fights, broken noses, stabbings and just about everything else. It goes without saying but Statham can certainly handle the action scenes and he's even given a few nice one-liners. Foster is the one who really surprised me. Of course he can handle the darkness of the character but he also did quite good during the action scenes. The two men made for a great team and they certainly helped keep the film moving. Sutherland is good in his few scenes and it's always fun seeing Tony Goldwyn playing a scumbag. The final thirty-minutes of the film pretty much throws all logic out the window as we get one violent action scene after another and this here is certainly what the majority are coming from. There's a very good sequence where the men trying to take out a religious figure and this entire bit is certainly the best moment in the film. There certainly aren't many major surprises along the way but it's pleasant enough entertainment. It still falls quite short of the 1972 version and the one thing that's really lacking here are guts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great beginning to the action flick season!! Statham is still action royalty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had pretty decent expectations for this film because I was ready to see a good solid ol' fashion action flick. The last Statham film I saw was The Expendables and that was just good fun! Anyone going to see this film should fully expect to see another variation of The Transporter because Statham is no different than Stallone or Willis or Schwarzenegger who people go to see to be cool, smooth, bad-ass action stars and he pulls that off flawlessly. Fortunately on top of that the story is solid, and interesting, dramatic with plenty of moments balancing killer action with good intensity. I have not seen the original film and that is surprising given I went though a big Charles Bronson phase back in the nineties. I definitely want to see the original now so I can compare them but I know the big budget explosions and cast will be different than the original. Best of all they kept the film 'R' Rated for adults so the film is chock full of gratuitous violence and an almost laughable sex scene that is literally slapped in there for red blooded males. No this doesn't make a good film but great eighties action films lived and breathed this recipe.Jason Statham sort of came out of nowhere and is quickly and quietly climbing the action star ranks. And you know what? He is darn good at it. He is simply a bad ass. He is unkillable, unstoppable and so incredibly smooth. He is just fun to watch and you know that when the bad guys think they have the drop on him, he has a whole different plan. He has chemistry on screen, and he just makes you want to watch and that makes him good! Ben Foster is a great young actor. He's come a long way and he has such incredible intensity in this role. Him and Statham have sort of good chemistry, not as good as I would like but they sort of clash but they sort of need to for this role. He is unhinged and wild and the polar opposite of Statham's Arthur Bishop. I think Foster has some big things ahead of him. Every time I see Tony Goldwyn I think, that's the guy that got Patrick Swayze killed in ghost (just as a side thought) but he does make a great bad guy. Problem is he is a little underused in the film but he still does make a solid villain for the story and you drool for a final showdown between him and Statham and you definitely get it! If there was a talent meter attached to this film it would go straight through the roof with the addition of a small supporting role by the amazing Donald Sutherland. He is truly great in this movie and puts some real powerful emotions into the role. Him and Statham have terrific chemistry as mentor and student.Here if more evidence of what separates run of the mill action to a good solid action flick that had lasting legs. Simon West, director of Con Air (an action classic by any stretch of the imagination and his first piece of work), The Generals Daughter (a solid thriller), and When A Stranger Calls. West knows what the audience wants to see and makes every location seem exotic and intense. Ignoring all else good about the film, the fact is Jason Statham is just an awesome action hero. In this case he's a bit of an anti-hero but you still want him to be successful in his quest for vengeance. Even when you might feel some sympathy for Foster's character, in the end you want Statham to be victorious. Anyone that loves action, anyone that wants the adrenaline pumping cinema experience must check out this movie!! This one will be in my collection for certain! "If you're reading this, you're dead." 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bronson movie has a better story. Moreover, I like how Bronson made many so called accidents happen. The remake follows close to the original story. Regrettably, the film laps into a few video sequence stunt scenes. Donald Sutherland's and Jason Stratham's charisma and chemistry save The Mechanic. The two actors make a run of the mill action movie stand out. The most memorable scene is when Jason Stratham throws a bad guy through a bus window. Also, the opening pool scene was a surprise too. I did not see that twist coming. Very intense! My wife likes the ending where the apprentice gets what's coming to him. Worth going out on a cold day. I give The Mechanic a 6 or 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Generally, I like to check out reviews on movies before I watch but for The Mechanic I was dying to see an action flick so I went in with no preconceived notions. What I got was an OK action movie with pretty decent fight scenes but a very predictable plot with many holes in it.First, let me commend the casting of Ben Foster in this, I am a big fan of his and it's nice to see him paired up with a well established action star in Statham. Statham was his usual self, he has a quiet confidence and charisma that make you overlook his lack of range. On the flip side, the casting of the villain showed no creativity at all.(this particular actor plays the same role in many movies, he's not bad at it but he's definitely typecast so when you see him pop up in a movie you already know where things are gonna go) So rather than put spoilers in here just know that a lot of things in this movie don't make a whole lot of sense so don't think too much if you want to enjoy yourself.If like me you're craving to see an action movie, by all means check this out but I think most folks are fine waiting to see it at home a few months from now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot is good. At least I fondly remember seeing the original with Charles Bronson as a kid. I did not now this was a remake before the final scene as i was quite young when i saw the Bronson flick.The problem with "the mechanic" (2011) is that the characters and their motivations are very hard to believe. They all act stupid and irrational and are very easy to deceive.Jason Stathams acting is barely reaching Steven Seagal level. In my world thats a bad thing. A stone face some snarls and fast punching is not acting.The only guy that sticks out is Ben Foster, but why did they write him to be so stupid and one dimensional like the rest of the lot? You don't really need complex character building in action movies but then again: this to slow to be an action movie. Just a warning: If you are hung over or for some other just feel like watching some mindless action, then this is not the flick for you. I give it 3 stars. 2 for keeping me interested for about 20 minutes and the final star because IMDb ratings are generally forgiving.Sorry for my English. Its not my 1st language and it's a bit rusty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just like in most of his movies he is assigned to kill and later he kills the big fish, a similar storyline. But this time it is much more fierce, with a lot of adrenaline rush. Just back from the movie and I can still feel the rush.. The Story line was typically a kind of routine, but the taking was amazing. A complete 10 on 10 for his action, extraordinary camera work, and amazing taking, and a 5 on 10 for the story line. Action movie freaks will never regret. Not to forget Ben foster, just another amazing action hero. Bishop(Jason)is a perfect hit-man, one of his target is Harry(Donald Sutherland) his friend and is given false reasons to eliminate him, which is done perfectly by bishop. He meets harry's son Steve(Ben Foster) at Harrys funeral and begins to mentor Steve to become another mechanic. Bishop is given false reasons to kill and feels used, and decides to get revenge. He accompanied by Steve kills boss and on the way back kills Steve as he finds that Steve is trying to kill him. It is a complete one an half hour entertainment..!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mechanic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Simon West (Con Air, The General's Daughter, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, The Expendables 2), I made sure to watch the Charles Bronson original before this modern remake, I expected this one to have a few more explosions, but perhaps not as much focus on story, but I chanced it. Basically elite assassin and occasional mechanic Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) who sticks to his own set of rules and has all the techniques and tricks to get away with the perfect hits on his given targets, including becoming attached from morals, making his kills purely business, and cleaning up after himself, making many of them look like accidents. His latest job though is to kill his mentor and friend Harry McKenna (Donald Sutherland), he on this occasion feels attached, he reluctantly shoots him and makes his death look like a carjacking, he attends the funeral, and it is there that he feels a little more guilty when he meets Harry's son Steve McKenna (Ben Foster). Bishops decides to train the young man to become a mechanic like him, and eventually he escalates to training him as a contract killer like him, and soon enough he gets his first target, another agency mechanic called Burke (Jeff Chase), but he goes for an alternative approach that goes against what his mentor has taught him to kill the man. Bishop's employer Dean (Tony Goldwyn) is not happy with the new young man not being professional, but Bishop ignores this and the pair go together for the next contract, on cult-like church leader Andrew Vaughn (John McConnell), but before they can carry out the job to suffocate or inject him they are discovered by the guards and forced to make a hefty escape. Bishop later discovers that the shooting of Harry was a trick by Dean, and their failed mission was part of a cover up, soon enough other mechanics are coming to kill him and Steve, they kill the ambushers and start to plan how to get back at Dean, and it is while getting ready that Steve finds his father's gun, he realises Bishop was the one who killed him. After killing Dean the pair are at a gas station, Steve pours gas around and then at a distance shoots it to create an explosion and blow up Bishop inside his truck, he returns to Bishop's place to do some last minute things before driving away in the Jaguar, he notices a note left by Bishop saying "Steve, if you're reading this then you're dead!", and moments later the car explodes and he dies, then the house explodes, in fact Bishop wasn't in the truck when it blew up, he disappears. Also starring Mini Anden as Sarah, James Logan as Jorge Lara, Christa Campbell as Kelly, Mark Anthony Nutter as Mr. Finch and Lara Grice as Mrs. Finch. As you would expect Statham does his usual hard stare constantly and is rough and tough when he needs to be, Foster is relatively alright as his counterpart as well, Sutherland could have been on screen longer, this doesn't have the same flair the original has, it is simply an excuse for more guns shooting and a few more explosions, but the violence is not as cool, and the story even though exactly the same doesn't feel convincing or gripping, a lame but maybe watchable once only action thriller. Okay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mechanic - 2.5 Stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Mechanic" is an entirely enjoyable action flick if you've only seen three or four other action movies, which is about equivalent to half a Michael Bay film. It considers the expectations of its audience. Guns are shot, stunts are pulled off, and cars are thrashed all over. But the real joy in movie-watching usually comes from the unexpected, which is a fact that this movie is either too lazy or too ignorant to recognize.The film stars Jason Statham as Arthur Bishop. The more movies he makes, the more I question his versatility as an actor. Like many of his past roles, Statham plays a character who is a "professional" at his field. His line of work must be illegal, because it's more fun that way. Would The Transporter's story be as exciting as it is if Statham delivered pizzas instead of? "packages"?However, Arthur Bishop doesn't deliver any illegal packages. No. He is employed by a secret company that pays him to kill people who are frowned upon by society. Hm. Is this company actually doing the country a favor? During the start, the movie showed signs of a slightly interesting story. It was ready to ask: "Is it, 'less wrong', to commit murder if you do it to the bad guys?" But as it drew longer, it strayed far from that question and closer to the guns, stunts, and cars.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/the-mechanic-movie-review/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jason Statham steps into Charles Bronson's shoes in the remake of the 1972 action thriller The Mechanic. Statham stars as an elite assassin who abides by a strict code. However, when his mentor and friend becomes the next target, her starts to re-evaluate his own code. The remake co-stars Donald Sutherland, Ben Foster and Tony Goldwyn, and is directed by Simon West. The film was released by Millennium Films in February oft his year (2011).Arthur Bishop (Statham) is known as a 'mechanic', a professional assassin that specializes in making hits look like whatever the clients want. When his friend and mentor Harry McKenna (Sutherland) becomes the next target, the agency sends in Bishop to do the dirty job. Bishop does the job, making it look like a car-jacking gone wrong. But things change when McKenna's estranged son starts looking for the killer (s).McKenna's son, Steve (Ben Foster), angered at the death of his father, sets himself as a target for potential car thieves with the aim of killing them as revenge. However, Bishop stops him before he does and, seeing the potential in him, trains him to become a 'mechanic'.Statham is brilliant in 'tough guy with a heart' roles. His character, Lee Christmas in The Expendables had the same characteristics and so did his character in The Transporter, and he has maintained his quirky British accent in all of them ? bravo! It is also good seeing someone bald in such roles. Most action heroes of the 80s and 90s were mandated to have hair (except Bruce Willis). In other words, he has managed to make action heroes look like the average Joe. However, a lead is only as good as his support and Foster also takes this one by the balls.Foster puts a certain energy into his characters that makes them seem too real. The sombre face mask he puts on in this role makes you believe the character he plays and the emotions he portrays. A few minutes into meeting his character Steve and you start to get a feel of the person. The film world can rest assured we will be getting more excellent performances from this actor.The plot in this film is average if you are expecting a complicated storyline with lots of twists and turns. Although there are a few twists in the film, there are always clues hinted in the film that sheds light on what happens next. However, that does not stop this film being a great action flick</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Cold-Blooded Macho Mayhem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have known about Jason Statham as "The Transproter" but I have not actually seen any of those films. The first Jason Statham movie I have seen is "The Expendables" last year. He stole the show there from right under the supposedly bigger star Stallone. That was why I was curious to watch this latest output from Statham.Jason Statham plays the title character "mechanic" or Class-A assassin, Bishop, as calmly and stoically as they come. His friend and mentor Harry McKenna (an ever-reliable Donald Sutherland) was summarily executed in his wheelchair. Bishop was approached by Harry's son Steve (an ever crazy-looking Ben Foster) to accept him as Bishop's apprentice in the assassin trade. Of course there is the head bad guy (an ever- slimy Tony Goldwyn) they both want to kill. Well, I was not going to be disappointed. "The Mechanic" is really a man's action film. It follows the typical macho action film formula of slam-bang fistfights, gunfights, car crashes, explosions, daring stunts, and the sexy girl on the side. No unnecessary chitchat. It even gives us some useful (?) medical information such as "Epinephine is toxic when combined with Adrenaline" or "Ketamine counteracts Adrenaline." Anyway, what the heck, we are not supposed to think in movies like this, right? Just sit back and enjoy all the cold-blooded mayhem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Jason Statham's best action films to date. Really enjoyable fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mechanic stars Jason Statham as a man called Arthur Bishop who is a "mechanic," code word for hit man who fixes problems for those in need. He plans ahead for all his contracts and carries them out to earn money for himself. He always works alone and does jobs for his mentor Harry McKenna (Kiefer Sutherland). One day Bishop gets a call from Dean (Tony Goldwyn) to do another contract of killing his old mentor who Dean believes is bringing down the business due to the fact he botched a contract job in Cape Town, Africa. Reluctantly Bishop agrees and kills Harry though he wants him to (rather than anyone else). Harry's son Steve (Ben Foster) upset over his father's death and determined to find the one responsible for killing his father asks Bishop to train him as a mechanic like him and he agrees where they join forces. Meanwhile some double crossing goes on in terms of Bishop's mentor and both he and Harry take down the man behind it all. Will Harry find out Bishop killed his dad? Well I'm sure you can guess. The story is very predictable and simplistic at best with a typical cliché story of father/mentor to one guy and his actual son who wants revenge. There is little characterisation and you don't really come to care about the characters though for a hit-man it is business. This is more serious than Statham's other films, which had a tongue in cheek edge to it like the Transporter series and the hilariously mad Crank films. The seriousness of Statham's character which surprised me at first, but I think it is a good thing as it is refreshingly different. The film does start off a bit slow as there is little action until about halfway through, but it sets up the story and characters nicely and I never got bored as the pace and tone of the film was generally right. The action was exciting and well choreographed, it was nicely shot and edited with some good music. The reason I gave this a seven rather than say a five or a six as I normally would do for trashy fun films like this was because the script actually wasn't as cheesy as I thought. It was reasonable and had a few surprisingly witty one liners, which I wasn't expecting.The second is the good acting. Ben Foster gets the witty one liners, but shows enough determination in learning on the job for vengeance and feeling distraught at his father's death. Statham though is the best thing in this with a good performance too, with the added fact he really looks the part. In the end this film has it's flaws like most action films, but the acting and the reasonable script with a few sharp one liners rates this above the average. Statham had redeemed himself from the terribleness that was The Expendables last year, which he was bad in. This is one of his best movies to date and as The Mechanic he certainly fixed things well for me to enjoy this movie from beginning to end. Well worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hire the Mechanic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I must say, if you are familiar with Jason Statham, you are familiar with this style of the movie. The action here does not disappoint, as it is filled with mostly stylized and intense fight scene choreography, along with some vehicular stunts and explosives. Not too over-the-top and bound to keep your eyes fixed to the screen. Stealth also comes into play quite nicely with the plot.What I must emphasize specifically with Mechanic is the storyline. It has a solid, satisfying beginning and middle, as you see character development between Statham and his trainee Ben Foster, you can sense some complicated terms of relationship and emotions in them and between them. There is a nice pacing of action and drama going on and interchanging. When it hits around the 2/3 mark of the movie, the pace/plot gets quite repetitive: An assassination is set up?Statham and Foster pursue him, during the pursuit there may be a mistake that results in a fight scene and maybe some guns, but the target gets killed, and the two move on. This cycle repeats?while you're wondering who the general enemy or conflict is, yet they do make that known later. The finale impressed me a little more with some twists and amazing stunts, and then I came out of the theater thinking it was good?overall decent, fun entertainment--but could've been a bit better. However, the action and the characters were still entertaining enough to enjoy the experience--so I say, Hire the Mechanic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A perfectionist. A man excellent in completing his assignments. Absolutely the best in his field, an elite assassin able to make problems disappear without anyone knowing. A day comes when his mentor and best friend is murdered. Furious at his friend's death Arthur Bishop puts out his own contract out on all those responsible for Harry Mckenn's death. In assistance is Harry's son Steve Mckenna. Arthur trains Steve and together they're off on a revengeful rampage. After all when the song stops playing the Fat Lady Sings. My Official 2011 opener for a great Action Movie and a terrific tribute to the original Mechanic of 1972. Over the Top performance from Jason Statham. He didn't wear a safety cable on the roof scene. What a nut. You got a story, dead dumb guys, bullets flying, Jason Statham, Ben Foster, and Donald Sutherland. What more do you want. 4 out 5 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action remake of a far better Charles Bronson Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This new version of the brilliant Charles Bronson original has some of that movie's scenes more or less copied into its plot, but without knowing its a remake, you'd be forgiven for thinking you were watching Transporter 4.Jason Statham is Arthur Bishop, a cold blooded hit-man who makes assassination attempts look like accidents and circumstance. But to look at Statham strutting around fit and tough as nails, he could be playing Frank Martin or Chev Chelios. As far as Action Movie Star is concerned, Hollywood belongs to Statham. But the plot doesn't offer anything new, and Ben Foster struggles to make something of his psycho role despite being great in movies like Hostage and the recent remake of The 3:10 To Yuma.what is good about The Mechanic remake is the action and fight sequences, they are entertaining and thrilling, but afterwards you come away from the cinema with a kind of Seen It All Before attitude. Would Hollywood please stop making rehashes of classic originals?Cal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best remake I've ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Statham has always made his niche in action films. In the remake of "The Mechanic" he put the "A" in action. He plays Bishop, an elite assassin made famous by Charles Bronson. Bishop is a mechanic: a person who fixes other people's problems with methods that make other killers look like amateurs. He meets a man who wants to his son under his wing. Unbeknownst to his son, he calls his father up and shoots him with his own gun. Because of that, he has more secrets than answers. The duo find their targets, and kill them on the spot. From the seedy informant to the cult leader, their kills are very precise. Each one have their excitement outside the assignment. Bishop meets the dancer and have his fun, the son gets his kicks for the first time. The shooting scenes are high octane, and bullets fly non-stop. From the original movie, it was tame and short. For the remake, it was wild and off the hook. The original movie: it was dead even, the remake: Find out for yourself! I'm not saying a word! Except I liked it better than the original. Rating 3 out of 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite entertaining! Jason Statham is a great actor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give this movie an 8, but Jason a 9-10. I am a huge Jason Statham fan. He is a great actor who knows how to entertain! I love his movies, and he is by far one of my favorite actors in Hollywood. He's raw, edgy, athletic and does his own stunts. I hope he stays around for a long time. I went to see this with my female friend, who is also a Jason Statham fanatic. Action/thrill is his game and he's so good at it. Ben foster was a good supporting actor in this, and was quite humorous at certain points. Overall this movie was very entertaining and was worth the trip to the movies. The only cons really was that the females portrayed in this movie were not so gratifying, if not shameful and also the fight scenes I thought, could have been a little better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid action thriller but makes no effort in plotting, development or structure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A hit-man has a friend. He is told that friend betrays the organisation and he accepts the job of taking him out. He then takes on his friend's son as a trainee. Then he gets in a battle with the organisation.That's the plot summary. If it seems very truncated and lacking connection then that is more to do with the film than it is to do with my lack of skill as a writer (although that too plays a part I guess). This remake of the Bronson film (itself no great shakes) wastes no time in getting down to business and we are rapidly introduced to hit-man Arthur. The we are introduced to his only friend (who mentions his son so we know about him too). Then Arthur is instructed to kill his only friend etc etc. You get where it is going and it does have potential but sadly this tick-box rush through the plot does rather rob it of what it could have been. By ripping though events I found that I never had a moment to start to care about the characters or for them to develop in anyway. This may not sound like a big deal (some action fans prefer all-out action) but the lack of any sort of foundation mean that the action is rather uninvolving and, although the action is solid, it is nowhere near good enough or exciting enough to be able to stand up to much if the viewer just doesn't care what happens.This is the case though, the action is only solid ? not brilliant and I did feel strangely detached from the film throughout. It didn't help that it also mostly felt rather mean-spirited. The (poor) CGI blood is part of this but perhaps also too is the lack of excitement and the lack of any sense of "fun". It wasn't the gore that bothered me, it was that the manner of the action seemed to be rather brutal but that the film didn't have any sort of dark heart in terms of substance to justify it. The plot goes along the way you expect until the ending ? which in the original film was one of the few things it got right; here it chickens out of the strong ending and goes the coward's way (maybe a typically unhelpful test audience ? I don't know). It is a shame because the ending just becomes one of many ways in which this film to be forgettable.The cast do the basics but they have little time between events to make things happen. Statham is a great presence and of course we are barely seconds into his first scene before he is out of his shirt. I like his gruff delivery and charisma and he does well enough here. Foster is capable of much (I know him from Six Feet Under) and he does have something of a character here ? shame the film never gives him too much time to do much with it. Goldwyn is OK, Sutherland gets a few days work out of this and everyone else is genre standard. Sex scenes are rolled out for the target audience but even they feel like they just more events being ticked off.At a very base level The Mechanic works well enough to distract. It has some OK action and it goes through the main plot points with a brisk pace as if it has somewhere else it would rather be. The CGI blood is so-so and done without a lot of heart ? much like the majority of the film. It lacks development, plot or meaningful foundation and as a result it never really engaged me in the way I would have liked. Not awful by any means (fans of Statham will enjoy him in it) but I watched it and forgot it ? I never really felt engaged by it or that it really cared whether I was or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Jason Statham movie in years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been sorely disappointed over the past three to five years with Jason Statham's work. Transporter 3, Crank 2, The Expendables, Death Race (not too bad, but still disappointing), Chaos (I liked it but it wasn't that good), and War (you would think based on the premise that it's two of the better martial arts actors in the world that this would have been phenomenal but it just missed on all cylinders). The only movie that I have seen of Mr. Statham's over the past few years that passed my expectations was The Bank Job, and I truly believe that movie flew way too far under the radar because it was better than most critics gave it credit for.That being said, I went to this movie with a pretty remarkable record with being disappointed in the past four Jason Statham movies I had seen, almost as bad as the Cleveland Cavaliers 26 game losing streak. However, this movie is good 'ol kick your buttocks out of the seat, throw your fists in the air, gun slinging, blowing up cars, fun.Statham in this movie is your typical Statham character, in every sense of the saying. He's silent with his words, but speaks out loud with his eyes and when he does say anything it's usually either something that makes you half-heartedly smile or something really meaningful. We all know and love this Statham. Truth be told, this is EXACTLY like his character from The Transporter movies, EXACTLY LIKE IT. He's hired by one person to do a job (usually dirty) that most people don't realize is being done and in one way or another one of his jobs pisses someone else off and things go to heck from there.This is the Statham that we all love (as I said), this is the Statham that I've been wanting back for a really long time. He doesn't strike me as an actor who will be dolling it up on the big screen in a big time dramatic role and have the Oscar buzz about him, so he needs to stick with the roles that will satisfy his fans until the next one. Lets face it, he's never really going to be a world renowned actor for his acting skills, he's going to be known the world over for his kick butt martial arts extreme stunt coordinating movies that get your adrenaline pumping the right way by mixing all those with good story, deep characters (for action flicks), and more and more kick butt-iness. It's just who he is and I for one love him for it. This movie, totally the Statham we've been wanting for a while now.The real story here though is in fact Mr. Ben Foster. Wonderfully talented actor, and the emotional scars he can expose just by that painful expression in his eyes and on his face is evidence of a star just waiting to burst out on to the A-list spotlight. One of these days soon, he's going to be a name everybody knows and loves, much like Joseph Gordon-Levitt is doing now. Ben Foster here has a character similar in the aspect of the pain his character is going through on a regular basis to his character in Alpha Dog. Really good acting here on his part.The story is a typical story of hit men being hired by corporate snobs to take each other out only to find that the stories they have been told MAY have been the same type of lies they feed to the public on a daily basis. So what really did happen in South Africa? You'll find out towards the end of the film. Until then, all we really care about and all we SHOULD care about is how much butt can the combo of Statham/Foster kick in the hour or so between when we first learn what is happening and when we finally find out. The added twist of Ben Foster's father and what happened to him throughout the film is a little bonus that gives the movie a little more heart and a lot more kick down the line. One of my favorite things about this movie is that when most directors usually try to draw a process or conversation out that really doesn't matter, Simon West FLIES through those moments while giving Statham's character a quick cliff-notes style narrative over those particular points in the movie. That's one thing that bothers me about a lot of action movies these days is that they try to hard to explain certain moments and characters believing that it is going to add "depth" to their film when in reality it slows the movie down when it doesn't need to and ultimately takes away from the film as a whole. Great job by Simon West to recognize that and move through those moments painlessly here.This movie is just good 'ol fashion kick butt fun like it was meant to be. Sit down, relax, and pump those fists in the air with every pull of the trigger and explosion on screen, you are in for one helluva fun time at the movies. Don't take it to seriously please, and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Jews On The Mechanic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is directed by Simon West stars Jason Statham as Arthur Bishop, a 'mechanic' - an elite assassin with a strict code and an unique talent for cleanly eliminating targets. It's a job that requires professional perfection and total detachment and Bishop is the best in the business.When he's tricked into killing his close friend and mentor Harry (Donald Sutherland) Bishop's world is very quickly turned upside down. Harry's son, Steve (Ben Foster) approaches Bishop and talks him into mentoring him...He wants Bishop to teach him everything he knows so he can become an assassin and avenge his father's death. He has no clue that Bishop is the man that killed Harry. Against his better judgment Bishop agrees and starts to teach Steve the tricks of the trade. Steve is everything Bishop is not...impulsive and sloppy. But the two men soon form a bond and we follow them as they track down and kill one man after another until they reach their ultimate goal...avenging Harry's death.Tony Goldwyn plays Dean Sanderson, the head of the agency that employs Bishop. 'The Mechanic' is a remake of the 1970's film with the same name that starred Charles Bronson. This is a super violent film. The stunts are good, but it's a story that you've seen many many times before. You can see the twist coming a mile away. It's for that reason, 'The Two Jews On Film' awarded 'The Mechanic' a very low bagel score.Opens in theaters, Friday January 28, 2011.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just another Hollywood action movie which is very predictable and almost routine with the action and formula.Not overly bad, not overly good.Entertaining and amusing but of course, not thought provoking and an easy to watch movie to pass time with.Is it the best action movie ever? No.It's similar to CRANK and The Transporter and others of which Jason Stratham stars in.It's formulaic and because it is, this movie gets the routine average votes - because of the routine average story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mechanic was awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Didn't even know there was a original until I got the theatre, we got free advance screening of the tickets, and they asked who has seen the original only one guy in the packed theatre. We were late so we had front row centre, which was bad as my Husband got motion sickness half way and left the movie because of the shaking camera work.I love action movies and I love Action movies with a good plot these really didn't have much of either. I thought it would be more like transporter 1. The plot half the time I was like WTF and the action some of it was unnecessary brutal and graphic like a Guys Head being Shot off and wasn't skilled fighting either (which I love) I hate when they machine gun the big boss down so no one on one combat.The Main character other than Jason, forget the Actors Name, hated his character he was whiny, ungrateful and when he died I was like good he should have killed him sooner.In the end almost everyone dies and that's that no conclusion really and thank goodness it didn't leave off for a sequel.I was reading the reviews about a lot of swearing but there wasn't that much they seem to substitute Swearing for Nudity and some sexual advances **Beware, there is a few graphic Sex Scenes are are not in the parental advisory, there were no naked chicks that I saw in the club but the one he was having Sex with (lots of close ups) and a graphic Porn scene** Overall I am glad the movie was free, Disappointed though, seems like Movies are just going for the X factor and lost its skill along the way</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a con!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>despite some poor reviews i went into this with an open mind. The story was good (ish) the right actors were in place, the writing was OK ish too.The thing is this was an action movie and I'm sorry to say all the fight scenes were a cheap Hollywood camera trick..... Every time they got into it, you know ripping someones arm off or something the camera moved up close and shook a lot. It's like they can't be bothered to choreograph and film fight scenes anymore and thats a shame because Jstat can really do it well as we saw in transporter. Unfortunately he hasn't been in a good movie since the transporter trilogy.If your a true movie fan don't bother watching this, if your at the movies to play with your girlfriends leg etc then go for it.I think his next film should be called "The pink fluffy gigalo" or something because going by his recent films he cant fight or perhaps holly thinks we don't mind being camera conned??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're looking for a mindless popcorn flick, this is for you. All it is is a Jason Statham movie. It's about a guy who hires professionals "mechanics" (hitmen) to kill criminal lords. Sound familiar? Anyway, as we progress through the movie, it's just shooting and swearing, like the Green Hornet, only much worse. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KID TO THIS MOVIE. JUST SAYING. And you're about to walk out of the theater, BUT WAIT! Oh never mind, it's just a dumb gunfight. Don't see this movie. See the Green Hornet, which is just like this movie, but just a little better. Jason Statham should stop making movies. Death Race, War, The Expendables, Crank? He's only made three good movies in his life (The Bank Job, Transporter 1 and the Italian Job) and this is not one of them. I do not recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give this version of The Mechanic a score of seven out of ten points. I am writing out the full words for numbers instead of just putting the numbers because I hate how we have to type a full ten lines just to get a review approved. Alse it helps that I just wrote all that stuff explaining how I was typing out full words haha just a few more lines to go.Jason Statham does his typical Jason Statham thing and for a fan of his movies like me that is great, he's not as awesome as he was in the Transporter movies etc but is still very good in this movie and it is a less intense movie than those movies were anyway. He is a hit-man and that is all you really need to know. Guys will like this movie a lot but it is less good when you saw the original the Mechanic movie with Charles Bronson which was a very awesome and surprisingly under rated movie masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>** Statham was born the year the Original movie was released **</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Re-makes of movies does not get my special interest. I find the content to be lacking in theme. Some times mindless action seems to be enjoyable to younger viewers. I find that the first "Original" with Charles Bronson was so much better and unexpected. This new version was very predictable. I wish Statham would use some more variation to his talents. This movie could be far more interesting with out the extra fight sequences, He is a hit-man and should be much more sinister. Statham should start making movies with his great fight ability, combined with a story line that is not only based on that strong point. well shall we wait for the next remake !! Gosh where are the ideas. Please don't re-make "Three Days of Condor " my personal favorite</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely awful. All it is, is a another Statham movie. If they really wanted a good remake of the Classic, they should of tried a ageing more intense actor like Mickey Rourke with a director like Walter Hill. They you go, the film sucks. If you love the original, and you like Statham, don't billed yourself up. Try to see this as just a normal movie and not a remake of the Bronson Classic. But for me this is still rubbish, Its no Sly or Arnold, and i'd prefer Van Damme doing this, Statham just doesn't have good qualities. If you like Statham then you'll probably like this.Peace out 0/10</fullReview>
