		<shortDescription>A must see for people who love "mechanics"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another classic Bronson movie and not to be missed. This time Charles is Arthur Bishop, a merciless, unfeeling, uncaring and strictly by the book assassin who is the standard by which all other professional killers are measured. Meticulous to a fault and as calculatingly efficient as can be, Bishop systematically completes his missions and returns to his mansion each night. Soon after eliminating one of his old friends, he becomes attached to the dead man's young and impertinent son Steve (John Michael Vincent), which quickly progresses from friendship to business relationship. Bishop agrees to mentor Steve in the tricks of the trade as an "associate" and after working with him he is free to do as he pleases. However, Bishop quickly discovers that is apt pupil is more nefarious than he appears as Steve has already accepted a contract on Bishop's life. But what Arthur doesn't realize yet is "the organization" to which Bishop belongs now wants him eliminated and will stop at nothing to achieve this goal. Bishop has broken a rule in taking Steve under his wing without first getting approval of "The Man" and is therefore marked for death. This film is filled with action, intrigue, and of course suspense as you continue to wonder the whole time which "mechanic" is gonna get his car fixed first. The ending is quite unpredictable for a 70's Bronson movie but enjoyable to the last second. Also features a cameo by Bronson's late wife Jill Ireland. One of Charles Bronson's better accomplishments on the silver screen I sure was impressed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Bronson film ever and also one of the 70's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They sure don't make them like this anymore: smart, realistic, tough and fascinating. Charles Bronson is in top form here, he plays a hit man with creative and untraceable way methods of killing, he is like a "death doctor" and when he "fix something, it never works again". But things aren't so good for him lately, he suffers from anxiety and collapses in one memorable scene. He then decides to take under his wing the young Steve Mackenna (Jan Michael Vincent in one of his better roles) and teach his the skills of the trade. Director Michael Winner put together a piece of classic cinema with everything seems to work perfectly. The cinematography is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen, especially the final scenes located in Italy. It's a shame that this film is almost unknown to the young generation and is way underrated here. The twisted ending certainly lifts up the already high level of the film. Highly recommended 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The absolute cream of Bronson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are excellent Charles Bronson movies and then there's a huge bunch of Bronson films that are not quite as excellent, so-called b-thrillers - films that only dedicated Bronson freaks love. However "The Mechanic" is certainly one of the best action thrillers he has ever done and definitely the biggest classics of good old Charles.I was thrilled when I watched it as a kid when it came from television and it gives me a very pleasant nostalgic feeling when I watch it nowadays from dvd. For example the motorcycle chase or the surprising ending works every time (although it clearly doesn't come as a surprise today). Bronson is at his element: calm, tough and cool. Very intelligent and enjoyable movie. If you're a fan of 1970's style of filmmaking, you can't pass this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charles Bronson Thriller with a wallop of an ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fascinating film about the life and lifestyle of a professional hit-man, a Mechanic, and how dangerous that lifestyle can be not just for the person that gets "Hit" but also for the "Hitman" himself. Arthur Bishop, Charles Bronson, is the top "Mechanic" in the business and we see in the beginning of the movie how he does his job. Getting his orders through the mail Bishop sets up his victim by casing out his hotel room and then planting an explosive in his bookcase and rigging his gas-range to leak slowly so he wouldn't notice. Then wait hidden ,across the street facing his intended victim's room, until the time is right for him to get off a shot. Not at the victim but at the bookcase to make it look like the he died in a tragic accident instead of an assassins bullet. You see this all happening in the first fifteen minutes of the movie without a single word of dialog but it's done so well that you know exactly what's happening on the screen. The "hit job" that Bishop had at the start of the movie turned out to be a flaming success. One afternoon Bishop gets a call from a old friend "Big" Harry, Keenan Wynn. McKenna about some trouble he's having with the organization and if Bishop can help him out. Being that Bishop's father was one of the founders of the organization "Big" Harry feels he can get whatever trouble he has with it smooths out. Bishop tells "Big" Harry he'll see what he could do. The next morning Bishop gets an envelope in the mail from the organization for his next hit and the person Bishop is contracted to knock off is non other then "Big" Harry. Going through the motions as usual Bishop plans his "Hit" on "Big" Harry with cold calculations and no emotions at all even though he knew "Big" Harry since he was a little boy. Getting "Big" Harry to meet him in a secluded place by the beach Bishop takes a number of shot at him but not trying to kill him but to induce "Big" Harry to have a fatal heart attack which he does. This is doe by Bishop so that the police and maybe even his fellow mobsters wouldn't be suspicious of any foul play in "Big" Harry's death. "Big" Harry's son Steve, Jan-Michael Vincent who Bishop met when he came to see "Big" Harry begins to take a very strong liking to him after his fathers death. It's as if Steve wanted Bishop to be his fathers replacement. Even though at the time when Bishop saw Steve with his father they weren't exactly that close and Steve seemed to have a dislike and resentment for his dad even at his funeral that Bishop attended. It seems that Steve wants to become a "Mechanic" like Bishop and wants to learn the tools of the trade from him, who's the best in the business. Steve likes Bishop's pad in the country and fancy sports car and most of all the danger of his job that is very exciting for the young man who was bored with his life of unending parties. You start to wonder if thats really the reason Steve is so interested to be around Bishop? Does Steve want to get even with Bishop, who Steve seems to know, killed his father? And why does Bishop seem to be so agreeable with Steve in teaching him about the art of killing in secret? Or is Bishop not as naive as he seems to be and is setting Steve up for something? Intelligent film about the dirty business of the assassination game with Charles Bronson and Jan- Michael Vincent very good as cold-blooded killers who show no emotion at what they do. Slow in the action department, for a Charles Bronson movie, at first but better acted and written then most of the movies that he made back then in the 1970's. With an ending that's one of the best and most surprising finals you'll ever see in any movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bronson doing what he does best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The early seventies was a great period for Bronson. Having already reached fifty and a string of classics under his belt as a support player in the sixties, the seventies was his decade. His ice cool tough guy image and immaculate physique made up for his rugged leading man looks and put him more in line ahead of the Redfords and the Newman's for gritty urban thrillers. In Basic terms Bronson could play a ruthless good guy, he had played his fair share of Indians and Mexican Bandits, but never was he better cast than when he portrayed Arthur Bishop, professional hitman for the Mob, The Mechanic.With great locations, exciting outbursts of action and a surprise twist, this is seventies action entertainment at it's best and it was the period where Director Michael Winner's collaboration with Bronson proved to be his best work to date. They went on to make another great urban crime thriller THE STONE KILLER and then DEATH WISH, Bronson's most famous movie.It's a shame that both Bronson and Winner's films and reputations went down hill in the eighties but perhaps age went against the seventies icon, as for Winner he returned to Britain and went back to making dire comedies.But the seventies saw Bronson in many roles that would categorise him as typecast but perhaps he knew his limitations and knew he was never gonna be a romantic lead. Although his late wife, Jill Ireland may have disagreed, she appeared alongside him several times over the space of twenties years, check out a movie entitled FROM NOON TIL THREE, a romantic western that people didn't want to see.Audiences want to see Bronson as tough, cool, calculated and deadly that's why THE MECHANIC is the perfect vehicle for the screen legend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BRONSON at his peak: one of THE action-movies of all time !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The early 70ies were the years, when CHARLES BRONSON as leading man could do nothing wrong. Every single movie he made in those years from 1970's CITTA VIOLENTA to 1975's BREAKHEART PASS was a commercial winner all the way and most of them were artistically successful as well. He worked with the best of western- and action-directors then (Michael Winner, Don Siegel, Terence Young, Tom Gries, Richard Fleischer, John Sturges, Sergio Sollima) and they usually turned out their best efforts with THE MAN starring in the leading role. The movies THE MAN turned out then one after another are now considered among the best of its kind ever made.THE MECHANIC is clearly no exception to this rule. On the contrary, among his superb movies of these (sadly long gone) days, THE MECHANIC shines as one of the best. Some even consider THE MECHANIC to be the best movie Mr. BRONSON ever made! Personally I would no go that far, but it is definitely one of the best five he ever made, the others being HARD TIMES aka THE STREETFIGHTER (please also check my comment there), CHATO'S LAND (again, please check my comment there), of course DEATH WISH I and MR. MAJESTYK.Actually THE MECHANIC is more than just a mere action-flick, it is a socio-economical study of the lives and times of a top-level professional hit-man at the peak of his power and his connections and ultimately fateful troubles with the mafia and mafia-structures. It is a so matter-of-fact-made movie that one can not deny its "documentary-style".BRONSON looks GREAT as the "mechanic", the top-hit-man, the "killer of killers"! He's superbly clothed, always apt to the needs of the scene, wears suits and tie here and there, casual clothes in other occasions and an awesome leather-jacket in other memorable scenes. And the hair-cut is awesome as well (when have you seen a professional hit-man with that long hair?). BRONSON hardly ever looked better. When he left us in 2003, newspapers over here often chose pictures of him in his prime from the early 70ies, some taken from THE MECHANIC, him holding the ultimately fateful glass of wine in his huge hands. Memorable, ain't it? :-)Back to the picture itself: Right from the beginning THE MECHANIC is filled with awesome frames. Just take the first one: one sees just blue sky. Suddenly - seemingly from the nowhere - Bronsons stony face fills the screen (one has to see this on a BIG screen!). Jerry Fieldings superbly fitting music (now on on CD by Intrada) starts right the same second. We see THE MAN entering a building. A short greeting follows (which is the only word spoken in the first app. 15 minutes). Then the professional does his first job, knocks off his first victim, whose murder is disguised as a gas explosion, without emotion, just a job to be done. Then the murder of Harry McKenna follows, where Bishop shows no outward regret for his actions, putting the brutal demands of his job over his friendship to Harry.ARTHUR BISHOP is certainly no average hit-man. He lives in a swell mansion up at Mulholland drive, the paintings on this wall are reproductions of Hironimus Boschs' work, when he plans the best way to do his jobs = killings, he listens to classical music, the furniture is well chosen, he loves a glass of wine after a well-done job. A man with manners and good taste. Not a dumb-ass, a clever hit-man, one with brains. His Dad already worked for the mafia (as a judge, in fact). A man with roots.Emotionless, tough and quiet (but when he says something, then it's well thought-over), he is nevertheless intelligent enough to know, that this ain't a job he can do forever, that he is in the twilight of his career. So he decides to take a companion/apprentice, young J.-M. Vincent (in his best role), to teach him the trade and to have somebody to be able to rely on in dangerous situations. THE MAN ain't that young anymore, a 2nd man could be a needed asset, a backup in dangerous situations.The mafia disapproves of this, but Arthur Bishop is strong-willed ...Bronson and Vincent fill their parts to perfection and these ain't easy parts. Character development, not too usual for this genre, is a strong point of this movie together with a handful of superbly staged action-sequences. At a running-time of a little over 90 minutes, there is more happening in THE MECHANIC than in many other movies, and still you are not watching a hectic movie (like most action flicks today are). As another admirer wrote "'The Mechanic' is a tightly-bound drama that uses everything - dialog, emotion, physical action - with stunning economy. Like a tightly-written novel, the film sheds all unnecessary padding and only gives us what is absolutely important to the storyline."This ain't a lightweight picture, this is prime stuff. Every frame is well-chosen, every scene has its meaning, Mr. Winner clearly put a lot of effort into this one (as well as his other efforts from the early- to mid-70ies - Winner became a slob only later on). There are not many pictures, which one can watch every second year and still be filled with thrill, but THE MECHANIC accomplishes this, it is a movie "that updates itself each time you watch it".Watch it ! :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic Charles Bronson. I've only recently really started getting more into his older films; I'm fluent with the Death Wish series. The Mechanic is one of his best, if not one of THE best action/thriller films I've seen. Very cleverly done, particularly his methods of killing. I also like the term used to describe assassins; that's new to me. The movie had me intrigued throughout, with Bronson playing the part very well; very few people could look as wrong as Bronson. But it's the ending that makes the movie that much better, because it's totally unexpected. I want to 'spoil' it so bad but I won't....although other user reviews here may have already. I'll just say that you'll be completely amped afterwards, your jaw will drop to the floor at how cool and unexpected it is. One of the true classic action films; the rating on here should be higher.***1/2 out of **** stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>15. THE MECHANIC (action, 1972) Arthur Bishop (Charles Bronson) is the mechanic, a hit man hired by the Organization as an assassin. Bishop's contact to the Organization is Harry, a long time confidant of his late father. Bishop is meticulous in his work. He is without feelings or remorse, the consummate professional. Bishop's next target is Harry. He carries the job through without hesitation. Harry's son Steve (Jan-Michael Vincent) lives the life of a dilettante playboy. He suspects Bishop's involvement in his father's death, and tries to find out what his ties to the Organization truly are. Critique: As far as spy and espionage films go 'The Mechanic' is one of the best. Not only for those Charles Bronson aficionados (like myself), but for lovers of well-made action films. Michael Winner's clever direction adds a sparkle to the genre. He sets up interesting insights into an assassin's mode of work. A cut above Death Wish (1974- Bronson's best known film), in both content and script, Bronson's performance is the epitome of cool. He's perfect at playing a character that has been totally detached from the outside world, and a man trapped in a world he can only have created. In the same way that Steve McQueen used his laconic presence to great effect, Winner makes full use of Bronson's craggy features.QUOTE: Bishop: "Murder is killing without a license. Everybody kills."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murder Is Only Killing without a License</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The forty-two year old hit-man Arthur Bishop (Charles Bronson) is frequently hired to kill without a trace and he carefully studies the profiles of his victims to find the perfect and clean way to execute them. When he is hired to kill "Big" Harry McKenna (Keenan Wynn), who was a former friend of his father, Arthur meets his son Steve McKenna (Jan- Michael Vincent) asking money to Harry at home. Later in Harry's funeral, Steve asks for a ride to Arthur and they become very close. Arthur finds potential in the twenty-four year old Steve to become a professional killer and he invites the youngster to form a partnership with him. However his attitude displeases the Powers that Be and Arthur is sent to Naples to kill a mobster. Arthur finds a file about him in a drawer at Steve's house but he invites Steve to travel with him to Italy. Sooner they learn that someone wants them to see Naples and die."The Mechanic" is an engaging film by Michael Winner with another great performance of Charles Bronson in the role of a "mechanic", meaning a hired hit-man that kills his victims without leaving a trace. One of the best lines in this film is when he tells to Steve that murder is only killing without a license. Jan-Michael Vincent has one of his best performances in the role of a youngster that believe that he has learned how to lure an experienced man. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Assassino a Preço Fixo" ("Killer at a Fixed Price")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No, he doesn't fix cars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the numerous tough guy roles played over five decades by Charles Bronson, 'The Mechanic' is a pretty safe bet for the movie that best captures his on-screen persona. While cases can be made for 'Once Upon a Time in the West,' 'Mr. Majestyk,' and 'Death Wish,' Michael Winner's 1972 potboiler not only sketches Bronson as a quiet, almost stealth-like force, but also gives us deep motivations for his character.'The Mechanic' is one of Michael Winner's best efforts as an action director, although it falls somewhat short of the original 'Death Wish,' probably his crowning achievement in this genre. But 'The Mechanic' was a considerable effort for its time, mixing neat action sequences with ongoing character development. This is a far cry from many actioners before or since, which feature men who tear up everything in sight while not undergoing the slightest bit of change internally.In an adaptation by Lewis John Carlino from his own story, Bronson plays Arthur Bishop, a California hit-man who is in the twilight of his career. Bishop is still capable physically, but his work as a cold-hearted assassin is wearing heavily on his nerves and may even be creating guilt deep within him. After performing hits against a nameless felon and his good friend Harry McKenna (Keenan Wynn), he suffers a nervous breakdown and decides that an apprentice would be useful as backup.He discovers his protégé in Steve McKenna (Jan-Michael Vincent), a twenty-ish son of Harry. Bishop finds Steve an ideal candidate, having no clear empathy for the people around him. McKenna is taken under Bishop's wing and taught how to perform assassinations without leaving a trace of evidence. The hiring becomes a mistake, however, as it was made without the permission of Bishop's overseers (called 'the organization') and violates their code of ethics.Falling just shy of 100 minutes in length, 'The Mechanic' is a tightly-bound drama that uses everything - dialogue, emotion, physical action - with stunning economy. Like a tightly-written novel, the film sheds all unnecessary padding and only gives us what is absolutely important to the storyline. The opening 15 minutes present a "day in the life" of Arthur Bishop, when he carries out a murder disguised as a gas explosion. There is no dialogue in this sequence, except for a hotel clerk who offers Bishop his quick hello. The murder of Harry McKenna follows, in which Bishop shows no outward regret for his actions, putting the brutal demands of his job over friendship.The Mechanic's final hour tracks a growing relationship between Bishop and Steve McKenna, who proves even more ruthless than his mentor. Three well-made action sequences take place: a motorcycle chase, a yacht bombing, and a car chase along the mountainsides of Naples. The action sets are primitive by today's standards, but they do have a nostalgic charm that fans of the genre should like. The choppy pacing used by Michael Winner in these scenes more than delivers the goods; Bronson and Jan-Michael Vincent are a sturdy pair in the ensuing gunplay. The supporting cast are all second fiddle to Bronson and Vincent, but help to move this film along. Besides Keenan Wynn, Jill Ireland has a small role as Bishop's high-cost prostitute and a disturbing suicide attempt is carried out by Steve McKenna's girlfriend Louise, played by Linda Ridgeway.It would be easy to write this film off as another shoot-'em-up, but Lewis John Carlino's script offers much more. While the characters are from a way of life unfamiliar to us, they have much to say about how unfeeling ordinary people can be. There is also a deep-lying moral about why certain secrets may be best kept as secrets and why there is a price to be paid for not respecting the feelings of others. Michael Winner is not exactly known for philosophical discourse in his movies, but 'The Mechanic' is about as close as he gets to this area.'The Mechanic' is good but not perfect technically. Winner's trademark camera angles, zooms, and wobbles are used to great effect, backed by sharp cinematography from Richard H. Kline and Robert Paynter (European scenes only). Unfortunately, there is shod editing at times from Frederick Wilson (listed as Freddie Wilson in the credits) and Winner himself (using his pen name of Arnold Crust Jr.). While the gas explosion sequence is finely crafted, the seaside murder of Harry features a change from sunset to pitch-darkness in a single cut and Keenan Wynn's voice is badly dubbed. The final scene is also bungled (in my opinion, anyway) when end credits appear too soon and the film blacks out prematurely.Composer Jerry Fielding, who teamed with Winner on 'Chato's Land,' 'Scorpio,' and 'The Big Sleep' amongst others, wrote a minimalist score that adds tension in the right places. Production values are very good, particularly in the Italian setting, which is to be expected from a United Artists film of thirty years ago. Yes, the early 1970s style is there, with a psychedelic atmosphere and emphasis on bright colors, but I haven't seen a film yet that updates itself each time you watch it.And if there are such films, I wouldn't count on MGM to offer them, especially with how disappointing its DVD presentations of Bronson have been. The 'Mechanic' DVD offers widescreen and standard format, unlike such retails as 'Death Wish 3' and 'Death Wish 4' that are full frame only. English mono and French 'dubbing' are included as audio options, with English, French, and Spanish subtitles. Bronson DVD extras rarely get past the theatrical trailer and MGM's 'Mechanic' disc adds insult to injury by using not the original trailer print, but what looks like a TV spot with the film's alternative title 'Killer of Killers.' 'Death Wish' is mentioned in the ad, which means it was shown no earlier than 1974. Good movie, rotten package by this low-balling Hollywood outfit.*** out of 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Mechanic" is a movie so dirty, so evil, so gleefully wicked and hollow that Hollywood wouldn't- and couldn't- be able to make it today. And I mean that in a great way.Charles Bronson is a contract killer... ice-cold, calculating, patient. He feels not a whit of remorse about what he does and yet, fascinatingly, he doesn't seem to get off on it, either. The fact that this character is the film's protagonist- our hero, ladies and gentleman- makes the entire movie feel like some filthy vicarious thrill: This is what it's like to kill and be free of guilt. Charles Bronson is perfect in the role, under-stated as always, and he is most frightening in the scenes when he brushes the hair out of his eyes to stare at the photos of his next target on the wall of his living room. To him it's better than television.Jan-Michael Vincent shows up as a beady-eyed redneck rich boy nihilist, who feels closer to Bronson than he does his own Father. After spending time together Bronson finally takes the kid under his wing and mentors him in the field of professional killer, but it isn't long before he finds himself the target of his pupil. Now the two have to outwit one another- Father vs. Son, Master vs. Pupil- to see which is the most sociopathic and ruthless, and who will kill who first. They don't make 'em like this anymore.No, today screen gangsters go to psychiatrists and confess their love for animals. Bad guys are never really bad, and even when they are their actions are justified. Our heroes have to be Likable for the benefit of test audiences, and the good guys always finish first- just like in real life! This movie was made at a time when writers, directors and actors were allowed to be amoral, to have their characters question the existence of God or defy the imposed morality of the universe. Charles Bronson's movies are sometimes branded as morally bankrupt, borderline snuff films, but I think it's a lot healthier to indulge your dark side at the movies than to deny it exists and embark on a workplace shooting rampage. Call me nutty-nutty cuckoo...My favorite scene in "The Mechanic" comes when Vincent's ex-girlfriend calls him up and threatens to commit suicide... "Go ahead," he tells her. He and Bronson then sit in her living room while she slits her wrists and bleeds to death. It is a scene so disturbing and cruel that you can't help but be fascinated, and more than a little impressed. Also classic is the scene with Bronson and his "girlfriend." "The Mechanic" moves fast: it is a fun, amoral suspense film that will hook you and keep you absorbed you until the very end, with a great performance by Charles Bronson. See it.GRADE: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a scene in which Bronson, as a wealthy professional hit man, enters his house and finds the glamorous Jill Ireland waiting for him in a robe and ballet slippers. She's missed him terribly, she says breathlessly. Then she reads him a letter she wrote but was reluctant to mail. It's full of lovely prose. She begs him to carry her into the bedroom.Dissolve. It's the next morning and Bronson has just finished dressing while Ireland lies naked under the covers. "It will be an extra hundred this time" she tells him. "The letter took a long time to write." He throws a handful of bills into her jewelry box and leaves. Just another business transaction.The whole movie is about Bronson's dead soul. Some Boschian monstrosities fascinate him. But he cares nothing about women or anything else except living well. He runs into a kindred spirit in the physical form of Jan Michael Vincent -- young, handsome, blond, and as cold-blooded as Bronson himself.Bronson, takes Vincent under his tutelage. "I might need some back up." There is a brutal martial arts lesson. There is a mass murder in an opulent home. (Nobody in this movie is poor.) A couple of car chases ending in exploding fireballs. A shoot out on a yacht in the harbor of Naples. A motorcyclist roaring headlong off a cliff and hitting the bottom of the chasm with an equally impressive fireball.How -- you might ask -- does a motorcycle blow up if it smashes on the rocks? It's a good question.The musical score is fulsome, tinny, and full of ear-aching dissonance. Charles Bronson is the best actor in the movie.I can't imagine why the movie was made. Oh, Bronson can be fun with his striking Pancho Villa mustache but I prefer him as the hero, not as the guy who dumps his victims' bodies into an acid bath and tells Vincent, "By tomorrow morning they'll all be in solution." Most of his movies are dumb in outstanding ways but he's still a better hero than heavy. His villainy is retrograde and reminds us of those 1950s classics like "House of Wax," in which he was REALLY dumb.Beautiful houses, beautiful clothes, no performances worthy of the name, and a story out of Screenplays 101. Nothing much to recommend it.</fullReview>

Good cinematography and some nice subtle touches in amongst the action scenes. This is old school action with a believable lead who looks the part. This was released in 1972 and still feels fresh today. A story of trust or lack thereof and the fleetingness of life.This movie is recommended viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Action Thriller With Surprising Character Scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mechanic is a classic action thriller from Michael Winner on top form, starring Charles Bronson and a young and sexy Jan-Michael Vincent also bringing their best game. Although primarily a thriller about an aging hit-man and the young protégé he takes under his wing, there are also some interesting character scenes and insights into the life of a solitary, private assassin for the mob.I was very impressed with the cold, eerie scene where both Bronson and Vincent are watching a girl friend of Vincent's, who has slit her wrists and they both just watch her without trying to help. So quietly absorbing and disquieting. I also like very much the scene with Jill Ireland as a lover that Charles Bronson has some history and strained relationship with, only for it to be revealed as a deliberate illusion that he pays her for - so incapable of any real human relationship that the hit-man has to pay a prostitute to fake missing him when he's not around! Such scenes certainly stand out as unusual and not the standard talking bits between action in such films (and certainly far beyond what most filmmakers and writers would strive for in action movies today).However, the plot is mainly about Charles Bronson taking on assignments (including Jan-Michael Vincent's father early on) and then agreeing to let Vincent in on his lifestyle after the young man keeps sniffing around and shows a lot of interest. The opening assignment features several minutes without dialog as we see Bronson plan how he's going to set up the kill and then carrying it out and is a memorable opening. Later, the movie includes a thrilling battle in a mansion which turns into a motorcycle cross country taste. Another memorable action scene is a car chase on a narrow winding road which might remind you of a similar location in the Quantum Of Solace opening (except here you can follow what's actually happening much easier). The relationship between Bronson and Vincent is intriguing and leads up to the memorable ending with a nice twist to the proceedings. In a way you get a solid hit-man action movie and an episode of Tales Of The Unexpected wrapped into one. This is a very fun and solid action thriller and is very recommended if, like me, you appreciate the craftsmanship that movies had in the 1960s and 1970s and seem to have lost along the way. If you enjoy a good vintage action thriller and love Charles Bronson then this movie will deliver for you, I'm sure!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch Charles Bronson in his best action role!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the sixties, most of the movies in which I have watched Charles Bronson, he was always the tough guy...gritty man of action...macho man (The Great Escape, Magnificent Seven, Chato's Land, Mr Majestyck, Death Wish I to IV, Family of Cops I to III, Telefon, Murphy's Law, Red Sun, 10 to Midnight, The Evil That Men Do...) except for one, The Sandpiper, in which he played a painter, opposite Richard Burton &amp; Elizabeth Taylor. I have always enjoyed watching his movies.I consider this particular one as the best of his action movies.The storyline is pretty straight-forward, except for an unexpected twist at the end: A contract hit-man, seemingly about to retire, took on a cocky young man as protégé, who eventually turned the table on the master.Charles Bronson, played the contract hit-man (hence, the name, The Mechanic), Arthur Bishop. He was a loner but had expensive tastes. He worked for a sinister group known only as The Organisation, which issued all the contract hits. (It so happened that all the hits were criminals.) He took on Steve McKenna (played menacingly by Jan-Michael Vincent) as his protégé. His mind was cold as ice &amp; apparently twisted. They screwed up one hit assignment while working together, after which The Organisation, was upset &amp; put out a contract on Bishop. Apparently, McKenna took up the contract. The rest of the movie was a battle of wits among the two hit men.What struck me most about the movie was the quiet characterization of a contract hit during the first fifteen minutes or so. No dialog at all,...only a very sober music score. Bishop studied the habits, life-style &amp; schedule of his target, with meticulous observation &amp; detailed planning. Thereafter, the movie went on to show Bishop, working with McKenna, going after different targets - each with different circumstances &amp; each executed differently...ruthlessly, of course. The hot-pursuit action sequences - there were many of them - in the movie were beautifully orchestrated,...really exciting, especially the motor-cycle chase segment.There seemed to be one puzzling part in the movie: McKenna happened to be the son of one of Bishop's hit victims. Bishop knew McKenna's father, Big Harry (played by Keenan Wynn) since he was a kid. In fact, Big Harry was an associate of Bishop's own father, who also happened to be a founding father of The Organisation. I can only conclude this way: hit men have certainly to be cold-blooded animals. Not only that, they have to be calculatingly efficient in their work.The last fifteen minutes of the movie were quite unexpected. I would have preferred a totally different outcome. Go &amp; watch this movie to find out what I meant.On the whole, I find The Mechanic, to be an intelligent action thriller, with Charles Bronson in his best action role!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A majority of 70's film I watch on video have no plot or gaping holes in the story, or just plain unbelievable. Ie like the 70's style film Way of the gun. The true jems of this area really stand out and the Mechanic is a film thats, aged well, and is still showing on TBS. I love this film the story has twists, its believable, and the concept is fresh. A hitman who makes literal accidents happen, hires a apprentice to help himself out. The beginning is done extremely well there is no dialogue in the first 8 minits, and the viewer watches intently at Bronson's actions. There is a few hints about what is going to happen, and twists to keep the story interesting. This a smart action film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charles Bronson gives a splendidly steely and stoical performance as Arthur Bishop, a merciless and meticulous, but stressed-out aging veteran hit-man who lives by his own strict personal moral code. Cocky eager beaver Steve McKenna (excellently played by Jan-Michael Vincent) befriends Bishop. Bishop teaches McKenna the tricks of his lethal trade. But does McKenna have some other nefarious secret agenda concerning Bishop? Tautly directed in a supremely mean'n'lean stripped-down no-nonsense style by Michael ("Death Wish") Winner, with a crafty and ingenious script by Lewis John Carlino, slick cinematography by Robert H. Kline, a superbly shivery'n'spooky score by Jerry Fielding, and several stirring slam-bang action set pieces, this fine film certainly makes the grade as a very tense, exciting and suspenseful crime thriller. Popping up in nifty minor roles are Keenan Wynn as a crusty mob capo and Jill Ireland as an alluring prostitute. From its bravura laconic, virtually wordless first fifteen minutes to its startling double whammy surprise twist ending, this superior favorite never makes a single false step and delivers the immensely satisfying goods with exceptional skill and efficiency.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense and involving, one of Bronson's (and Winner's) best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Mechanic' is a fascinating film for a number of reasons. First of all, (and most importantly) it has Charles Bronson at his peak, doing what Charles Bronson does best. 2nd, the screenplay features Bronson as a protagonist that had not often been done before - the hired killer as a cold-blooded, stoic mercenary. And then it takes the remarkable step of making him almost an admirable and sympathetic character (he kills without anger or hate, he has his own code, he sees himself as fulfilling a need in society, and in spite of his skill and strength, he is starting to shake apart inside). And finally, it takes the premise into unknown territory by becoming almost a 'buddy' flick of sorts, as the master hit-man takes on a partner/apprentice and starts to teach him the secrets of his trade. By halfway into the film, you've learned so much that you almost feel as if you could become a professional killer yourself. We've seen elements of this kind of story in all kinds of places - in gangster films, in Westerns, in psychodramas, in coming of age films....even in foreign films like Sonny Chiba's "Street Fighter". But "the Mechanic" really made a unique blend of these story elements, and mixed them in with a rugged looking he-man lead (Bronson) who had an interesting chemistry with his young partner ( Vincent ) - part admiration, part rivalry, part peril (Bronson kills Vincent's father early in the film, but Vincent doesn't know it...or does he???) On top of that, Winner and his crew managed to imbue the story with a ton of atmosphere - the sound design for the film is brilliant, with long periods of muffled, claustrophobic quiet; the sets and props are lush and expensive and yet barren and comfortless. The dialog (except for Vincent's cocky young man) is clipped, flat and precise. There are all these neat little touches throughout the film to keep the viewer anchored to the protagonist's emotional mood and point of view. There is violence in the film, but it is choreographed with a kind of surgical precision that almost inspires awe and admiration. And did I mention that there is a hell of a lot of suspense in the plot as well? The "hero" is, after all, out to kill a bunch of people who object to his aims, there appears to be some kind of leak or betrayal putting him at risk; and the young apprentice is too cocksure and overconfident for his own good.Anyway, the best part of "The Mechanic" has got to be the ending, a classic payoff involving a voice from beyond the grave that will absolutely knock your socks off when you see it the first time.Even after several viewings, it still makes me whistle with admiration at the heartless precision and fatalistic élan of the Mechanic. Good stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arthur Bishop (Charles Bronson) is a very professional hit man , he is the number one killing people with a bullet whose reputation has caught up with him. Bishop makes his missions of the way more mechanic and perfect, for that reason he is known as ¨The mechanic¨. His last assignment results to be the killing an important business man . Stressed and tired plans to get out after one last job. He always works alone but he takes an apprentice (Jan-Michael Vincent) who learns the criminal lessons from his master, both have innumerable ways to murder. Both of whom form a relentless killer team but Bishop is caught in the middle of treason. As hot-headed Jan-Michael Vincent want to off Bronson and attempts to assume the position of top hit-man.This crime thriller packs intrigue, suspense, noisy action-packed with exciting motorcycle pursuit,explosive excitement, thrills and lots of violence.Bronson with his usual stoic acting displays efficiently his weapons and killing mercilessly his objectives .It's certainly thrilling , though the morality may be questionable , even in this time, as the spectators were clearly on the Bronson's side in spite of being a cruel killer . Bronson as a wealthy murderer for a powerful organization offers the sort of monolithic acting as always. Furthermore, appears a nice secondary cast , as Keenan Wynn , Frank DeKova and brief performance of Jill Ireland, Bronson's wife, as Bishop's love interest, but the romance isn't what this movie is about and director knows his action. It packs atmospheric musical score composed, orchestrated and performed by Jerry Fielding, Sam Peckimpah's usual musician. Colorful cinematography by Richard H. Kline for US filming and Robert Paynter for scenes shot in Napoles where is partially set the action with spectacular scenes of confrontation on road and a yacht. This big hit motion picture is professionally directed by Michael Winner such as the successive films with his main star, Charles Bronson. In the mid-70 Winner had great commercial hit , a box office success he repeated when badly in need of other hit smashes made similar movies, but both, Bronson and Winner teaming again, looked increasingly passionless and mechanical in the later years of their partnership. After directing the successful ¨Death wish¨¨ he made worst sequels in which Bronson-Paul Kersey goes on to torture robbers, all of them inferior and the violence could be deemed excessive, are the following : ¨Death wish II¨ with Jill Ireland and Vincent Gardenia, ¨Death wish III¨ with Ed Lauter and Deborah Raffin. Subsequently Michael Winner career was failed ,alternating some hit as ¨the sentinel¨ and various flops as ¨Firepower,The big sleep,The wicked lady, Appointed with death, A chorus of disapproval, and Bullseye¨.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Winner is not very popular these days. Some see him as a mediocre film maker. I would disagree with that: Winner has made some very good films and some which are not memorable so I would rank him with Val Guest as a very talented director who also works as a craftsman. The Mechanic is a good example of Winner at his best. He tells the story of a lone hit-man who seems to have no feelings at all and operates detached from the outside world almost like a Samurai. However, below that surface we see a very lonely man who pays a hooker to write him love letters and who suffers from depression and anxiety. He is a man of contradictions, a cultivated lover of classical music and fine wine and also ruthless killer. My only misgiving about the film is that I just don't see that degree of being torn between two extremes in Bronson's performance. I wonder what an actor like Clint Eastwood would have made of that role. Anyway, this leads to him adopting a seemingly kindred spirit as an apprentice to murder. Ironically, he is the son of his last victim. That is seen as breaking the rules by the organisation he seemingly freelances for and he realizes that he is not as independent as he thought he was. So both men are hunted and eventually set against each other. Bronson loses but the motive is not revenge, simply the lust to kill. The film then ends with a very twisted ending that makes you wonder whether Bronson's character really committed suicide through a third person. The story is originally and well paced with some spectacular action scenes. So all in all the film is both intelligent as well as full of suspense. Very, very watchable!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bronson's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Winner, Charles Bronson, Jan-Michael Vincent, et al, team up well in this uniquely intellectual and psychological approach to crime drama. Rather than a "Cleveland shooter" (a term used by Bronson in the middle of the film!) type movie, where overt action and mayhem become the modus operandi of the plot line, this movie probes the scientific and detailed approach that our "mechanic" engages in prior to his next hit. For example, note how meticulously he sets up the bomb blast in the flat at the onset of the movie; how painstakingly he photographs, lip reads and goes home to assemble all the relevant data for the next hit in an orderly fashion, accompanied by soothing classical music. Our mechanic does his work in such a monk-like fashion that he elicits our sympathy in an ironic fashion. He's kind of a "good" bad guy in that his hits are on bad guys anyway!But M. Winner shows us the psychological downside here as well, as our mechanic's seemingly comfortable exterior is besieged by demons lurking within his dark interior. J.M. Vincent, in his most intellectually demanding and articulate role, shines as the mechanic's protégé. Their frequent philosophical jousts embellish the psychological tension that M. Winner intends to infuse into the film. In short, you see sides of these two principals that you rarely, if ever, see in their other films. Some movies of this genre concentrate more on the tip of the cinematic iceberg, the overt action, whereas this film focuses more so on that majority of our metaphorical iceberg which lies below the obvious surface. This is a worthy addition to any film lover's collection.</fullReview>

The action scenes are very well made, though they cannot be compared to how things are done today. It makes you think that there may not be need for enormous amounts of of effects and animation to make a film work. More important is a good story, actors who knows how to get the job done and a director who have the ability to create an suspenseful atmosphere. The film has sparse use of dialogue and music.

		<fullReview>"The Mechanic" is based on simple and classic plot elements such as trust and betrayal but the magic that ties it all together is what makes this film stand out as one of my favorites. Both Charles Bronson and Jan Michael Vincent are at their best, aided in large part by an excellent screen play by Lewis Carlino who also penned the 1966 classic "Seconds" and later "The Great Santini" with Robert Duvall and "Resurrection" with Ellen Burstyn. The film has a slightly twisted perspective which, despite the predictable plot elements, leaves you guessing all the way to the end.Directed by Michael Winner, a long time friend of Bronson, at first glance the movie appears to be a typical 70's action film but Winner has taken the time to make it work . I'm not a big fan of Winner, with films like Death Wish being to blame but he did an excellent job with this movie and the character study of Arthur Bishop, in particular. The contrasts between the darkness of a Hitman who is also a trusted Mentor and the admiration of the Apprentice who is deceiving the Master are artfully woven into a film that is far more than the sum of all its parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has always been one of my favourite movies. I'm not the biggest Charles Bronson fan; I've never really been into his other movies, I can take them or leave them, (the Deathwish series, Chino, etc), but The Mechanic has always stood out for me. I think it's probably the storyline which grabs me, and of course the cool, methodical way in which Bronson goes about his business as Mr Bishop.In this picture, he is a one-man hit squad, or "Cleaner", as is the vernacular. He had always worked alone, in a deliberate and reliable fashion, until one day he decides to take on a helper. It's clear that Mr Bishop, should have sought permission before bringing in the new kid, but he obviously thought, mistakenly, that he had more autonomy than he actually did; a bad mis-calculation. It pays to know, or at least to be wary of the people you work for in such circumstances.The movie shows us not only something of what it's like to be in "The business", but also it shows us the heirarchical nature of the employers. They too are cool and methodical, and not about to be underestimated.Bronson gives a great performance here as a highly professional "Mechanic", very organised, taking one step at a time, and studying his prey. So also does Jan Michael Vincent as his apprentice, who perhaps learns too much too quickly. He's young, and that may be his downfall.I enjoy this movie every time I watch it, and the ending IS an absolute Hollywood classic, as many here have said. I only hope that they don't try to do a remake of this classic too, for they surely could not better it !! 9/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A professional assassin known as Arthur Bishop works for some anonymous gangsters, who give him his targets. He works alone, slowly studies his victims in great detail, while listening to classical music, drinking wine and squeezing a ball of wax in his hand. But time is getting to him, plus some company wouldn't go astray and so he comes across an old colleague's young and quite eager son, Steve McKenna, which he believes would be a perfect choice as his apprentice. Steve accepts the offer and so the two complete some hits, although Arthur's bosses don't like the idea.Don't be expecting a fully blown action flick here, as "The Mechanic" delves a little more into the character's motivations and close bonds with the action playing second fiddle to complex (if underdeveloped) characters. Although when it does come to the get-up-and-go, it does let loose rather tautly with some shellacking results, despite its passive frame of mind. It's far from electrifying, the pacing can get a bit sloppy, but it still managed to keep my full interest. Thanks largely to Charles Bronson's stone-like performance of portraying a character who's more complicated than what he appears. The way he goes about his business shows his fine eye for detail to making his hits look like accidents and there are some well thought out plans that are executed. The most interest comes from the infatuation and relationship between Bronson and Vincent's characters. Maybe you can read it as an underling homo-erotic subtext or even a father and son like progression, which I saw it more as. Even what's going in Arthur's head is quite a intriguing device within the film, but its never too clear. Jan-Michael Vincent as the raw, but quite cocky recruit learning the trade, Steve McKenna, is okay, if a little bumpy at times. While, the rest of the so-so cast just simply make up the numbers. The cold direction by Michael Winner is typically conventional, despite a few flashy touches and it being shot by Kline with some verve and intrusiveness. But Winter goes by it rather quietly and indeed briskly without the connection entirely being filled out. On the other hand, on show is a compact score that doesn't restrain itself. The one-note story and marginally wilted script doesn't have much of a base, but more so follows these two protagonists by steadily working every possible avenue, which leads to a spanking conclusion? checkmate.This bittersweet flick could have turned out great, but in the long run it's just a good flick and satisfying enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A killer of a thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mechanic aka Killer of Killers is surprisingly good and, unusually for Winner, also surprisingly well directed. A one-time Cliff Robertson vehicle (which at least explains the pipe Charles Bronson smokes throughout the film) and a clear influence on the Wachowski Brothers later script for Assassins, it sees Charles Bronson as the mob's most assured and ingenious hit-man for some reason taking on an apprentice, attracted perhaps by his sociopathic indifference to death. The first half of the film is so sharp that it's a shame the rest of the movie starts down a more conventional road, but the action is well-handled, with a couple of way above average stunts involving a crashing motorbike and, later on, a car pushed off a mountain road that is more comprehensively trashed on the way down than you've ever seen in a film before or since: this one doesn't need to go up in a fireball to convince it's occupant isn't walking away.Unfortunately the sorcerer's pathological apprentice is played by terminally smug and unpleasant future junkie, drunk and wife-beater Jan Michael Vincent (the man who sued the paramedics who saved his life after a drunken crash for not managing to do so without damaging his vocal cords): ideal casting, perhaps, but he's definitely a below-par Dennis Quaid act as an actor who seems to think he's good looking enough not to have to at least try to act. Equally unfortunately it also features the inevitable Jill Ireland (the star's wife and director's former girlfriend: that must have made for some interesting conversations on the set), albeit only for one scene, and for once there's a rather clever and perfectly valid reason for her bad acting. It doesn't make her big scene any less painful to watch but at least it stops it from doing any real damage to the film. If at times it feels like a more ambitious film may have been lost in rewrites, there's still a pleasingly nasty ending and any film where the first 15 minutes are played without dialogue gets extra points in my book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mechanic has Charles Bronson as an aging professional hit-man who seems to take his orders from an amorphous group known as the syndicate. The only time we ever see a higher up is when Frank DeKova gives Bronson a rush assignment in Italy, that turns out to be a lot more than he bargained for.For reasons that are never explained Bronson gets an assignment to hit Keenan Wynn, an old friend of his father's who was also in the business. And Wynn has a son Jan-Michael Vincent, a really amoral young man who wants to learn the ropes himself.I cannot figure for the life of me why Bronson takes in Vincent and does show him the ropes. Bronson is a loner, but even loners need friends at times. I've always felt there's an undercurrent of homosexuality in the relationship. But Vincent turns out to be quite the user.There's enough shooting and violence for those who like it in The Mechanic. As characters though, I really can't feel too much for either Bronson or Vincent.I will say this, the ending is quite good and quite unique.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hit-man Story is a McGuffin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The crime story of THE MECHANIC is just a front for the real story of a failed father son relationship. Many people who would see this film would probably point out holes in logic of the film, for example when Bishop (Bronson) learns what Steve (Vncent) may be up to, instead of killing him, he still takes him on as his partner.When critics talked about the AUTEUR THEORY (the mistakenly felt that only the director of a film could be the auteur. In this film, the true Autuer is the screenplay writer John Lewis Carlino. The relationship between Arthur Bishop and Steve McKenna is similar in ideas he would explore in his films THE SAILOR WHO FELL FROM GRACE WITH THE SEA, and THE GREAT SANTINI. Michael Winner the director, is almost the book cover printer and presenter of Carlino's vision.In a strange way, Arthur Bishop is rather similar to the recently passed Michael Jackson. Neither had good relationships with their father. They went into the professions that either their fathers where in, or where trying to get them in. Their childhoods were lacking. We sense from Bishop that his father did not give him the love that he so desperately wanted. The places he goes to are places that one might take children, a Wax Museum, an Aquarium, look at the scene where he looks at the window display, which displays to me things a child would want. From what we know about Bishop's father, with story of the fishing boat trip to Canada, this was a very cold man to his son Arthur. As Arthur sadly says, "That was a long time ago". People ask, why would Bishop take the young McKenna under his wings. While their were homosexual underpinnings in the original story, here the underpinning of the Bishop character are his desperation to be something of a father that he never had. Had McKenna been a little boy, he would not have trained him to be a killer, but certainly would have taken him to "the places for children" that he goes to. We see that Steve had a sour relationship with his father Harry (Kennan Wynn) though the father has tried to provide everything for his sons comforts, a son he does not understand. Steve says that he wanted to be like his father, not just a front, and he mentions that his father did not like his friends, and that he is not sure he likes them as well. What Steve does not know, but actually says, is that "Harry was his kind of man". Steve will sadly show, that he to is not such a good friend to Bishop. When Bishop learns of the possibility that Steve will try to kill him, he continues on with him because of his hope that they will have a relationship, though as we will learn, Bishop has plans for Steve if he does betray that relationship. Even when Bishop realizes that he has been poisoned by Steve, and will die,he asks him if he is being killed because Arthur killed his father Harry, I sense that Bishop is hoping for an affirmative response from Steve, hoping that Steve did it for his father, and perhaps before dying would warn Steve about the trap that he set. However, with Steve's callous answer "Oh you killed him, and I just thought he died",Steve has not just betrayed rules, he has betrayed the Father-Son relationship. What LAST TANGO was to Brando, MECHANIC is to Bronson. In his performance we see the pain that Bronson might have felt for the coal mining Father he never knew, and did not get the love from. In the scene with Jill Ireland as the prostitute who puts on an act of love for Arthur Bishop, Bronson shows for the moment before he carries Ireland off to bed, a vulnerable human being, and somewhat shows how much he really loved Jill Ireland, his true life wife.Many critics at the time were frustrated by this film. They somewhat admired it, especially Bronson's performance. They felt that their was a great film in the material. I think they may have not understood it. With the few films that Carlino made, I think many could go back to it like Roger Ebert, and really see it in a new light. Even on Steve Mckenna, the young man of 1972, would now be some ruthless head of a conglomerate today, and shows the failings of our society, people who do not want to live by a set of rules. While Steve McKenna meets his fate in the end, we sadly perhaps today have many Steve McKennas running our country and businesses, people now in their late 50's and early 60's. So much for the cultural revolution of the 60's. The MECHANIC may not be great film, but unlike some "great films", it is rich with ideas, and can be watched over and over again. Also, Charles Bronson was never better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mechanic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mechanic is another collaboration between Michael winner and his favorite actor Charles Bronson who he normally casts in his films and unlike their previous collaborations in such films like the death wish films and many others . Which i cannot be bothered to name this film isn't one of their better achievements the story concerns a veteran hit man Arthur Bishop who is pondering retiring after completing his latest job until he meets the son of a rich millionaire business man introduced to him by his Father played by Keenan Wynn named Steve played by a young and up and coming Jan Michael Vincent who explains to Bishop that he has decided himself that he wants to follow in Bishops foot steps and become a hit man himself Bishop then decides to take him under his wing and train him in preparation for an assignment that they will under take together which will test the limits of their friendship . This is a decidedly slapdash 70s action movie with a distinct lack of action and nothing else really the pacing is slow and lethargic the editing is inconsistent the script is littered with clichés and plot holes bored from thousands of other action movies the acting is OK but the two lead actors Bronson and Vincent are wooden due to the lackluster material they have to work with this could be due not only to the screenplay writers but also due to Michael winners farcical directing . Overall skip this film and go for some of Charles Bronson's other works he has been so much better in other films such as the Death wish franchise , Mr majestic , The great escape , Kinjite . Give this film a pass and go rent those movies instead which showcase his acting talents better than this film does .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Standing outside of it all, dead sure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd not watched this one before enjoying the hell out the Jason Statham / Ben Foster - Simon West remake, that was made a few years back.My exposure to Bronson were his movies in the 60s and the 70s, but I had not watched any recently, other than 'The Great escape', 'Once upon a time in the West', 'The magnificent 7', 'The Dirty Dozen', in all of which he was part of an ensemble cast, and stood out in any case, but the true viewing experience of a stand-along Bronson movie was something I had experienced a decade or so previously, if not more. First off, this flick is sparse in terms of prod design, using the motif, less is more. And how true that is. All the excesses of the remake seemed very loud and pretentious to me, while watching the set-pieces and the planning that went into keeping this simple.I also did not know that director Michael Winner made this with Bronson before they went full-iconic with 'Death Wish'. Nice preparing ground for that.For those who know the plot, knowing that this is set in a world of elite super-assassins that spend time preparing their kills, and report only to uber-businessmen/politician conglomerates, who're never seen and always behind-the-scenes, who're the puppet-masters, so to speak, won't be a surprise, since the largely-seen remake covered similar ground. However, what made this relatively more refreshing and more sane, is the choice this makes in keeping those characters in the background, instead of bringing forth the Tony Goldwyns of the day, for Statham and Foster to 'take care' of at the end.This choice made, seemed respectful of the idea that thrillers should at least try to keep the plot and their characters grounded, in order for the audience to empathize and get on the side of their anti- heroes, which otherwise might be a difficult task, like it is with every mainstream flick one encounters these days.The best part/s? - The 2 chases, one bike chase, and the other by car, sans CGI, pure stunt-work. - The plot, and the grounded-ness of it. - The performances, all alpha. - The tangential turns into meta-weirdness, esp. the scene set in a bungalow. - The chance to compare how inferior the remake is to the original. Sad for the Statham flick, since I thought it was good before watching this. - The fantastic pre-climax ending.I do hope they redeem themselves with the sequel to the remake, but do not have the required confidence that they will, considering West also has not signed back on (that might be a good thing, considering 'Wild card', but who knows).All in all, worth a watch, or maybe even a revisit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A better handled mechanic of movie needed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course, we all remember that explosive end to this film about an aging hit-man, who makes one dire mistake, by taking on a new young protégé, which he shouldn't of. Was it out of loneliness, or has this guy, found out there's no meaning to his life anymore? His pad is unbelievable, it almost made me think of taking this career path. Made just before Death Wish, cragged faced Bronson, does what he does best. The first fifteen minutes, that has Bronson, setting up one hell of a hit, sniper rifle and all, was so impressive, where rigging that guy's apartment, tampering with the gas stove whatever, you really wondered how the hit was gonna go down. In contrast, with this part of the film, being so wowing, it makes the rest of the film look ordinary, amongst some thrilling bits, involving the other hits. Jan Michael Vincent, doesn't give his role enough clout, as the all American nice guy, a hounding and avid learner, where his intentions were clear from the start, such a predictability. The motorcycle chase was the worse one in history, as well as boring and dull, I couldn't wait for it to be over. The young girl suicide scene was absolutely pointless and stupid, where Bronson's and Vincent's indifference to it, made them at that moment, almost unlikeable. Bronson was strong in this, a mixture of good and bad, where his acting partner didn't do him justice, and really two scenes with Jill Ireland, his girl here, were almost forgettable. What The Mechanic serves to do as a film in simplistic plot, is show you shallow the life of a hit-man can be, and what attitudes you have to adapt to, and not let personal issues get in the way. But also it makes you wonder, is it time to get out of this life when the goings good. It's a choice that worries us, concerning Bronson's character. Near the end, the last turning point was exciting to see, who was gonna be gotten to first, where I guess in one sick sense, they both came out even. I have a way good feeling the remake is better and of course, more action packed and exciting, though. It just would of been great if the rest of the movie kept up it's end of bargain, to it's explosive starting, where mostly the rest of the film, sad to say, is just one of ordinary. The "Keeping up the end of the bargain" factor, is a failing that can movies really suck. Even back in 1972.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good bet for Bronson fans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charles Bronson plays Arthur Bishop, an experienced hit man with a real skill at what he does. His work is almost like art - very morbid art, to be sure, but he's not content to merely drop victims with a bullet to the head. Unfortunately, he ends up ordered by his bosses to eliminate his old family friend, Harry McKenna (Keenan Wynn). After reluctantly doing the job, he finds himself drawn to Harry's son Steve (Jan-Michael Vincent), a cheerfully unambitious young man. Arthur decides that he will take on Steve as a partner, a move that will not sit well with the people for whom Arthur works.After their historic first teaming on the Western "Chato's Land", Bronson and director Michael Winner reunited shortly after, for what is essentially a character study. And that character, much like Bronson himself, is fascinating, revealing himself as a careful and precise person and also highly cultured. Not surprisingly, he has little time for such things as relationships (as shown in the scene with Arthur and a lady friend, played by Bronsons' wife Jill Ireland). There are fine action scenes here, to be sure, especially a motorcycle chase, and there are a couple of explosions along the way. But first and foremost, this is a film that takes a clinical look at two fairly icy men. The most telling scene occurs when Arthur and Steve debate how long it will take Steve's suicidal girlfriend (Linda Ridgeway) to succumb to the slashing of her wrists. Originally, screenwriter Lewis John Carlino had intended for the evolving relationship between professional killer and neophyte to be overtly homosexual, with the younger man at odds with his desires, but that idea was nixed, and in order for his script to get filmed, Carlino had to remove almost all of that subtext.Jerry Fielding supplies a terrific score, and the acting is efficient from our two main characters. Bronson is well cast, and Vincent holds his own quite well opposite his veteran co-star. Wynn is wonderful in his brief time on screen.Certainly the double twist ending is effective and "The Mechanic" is all the better for it. In the end, this is a good collaboration between a star and director that carried on to the iconic masterpiece "Death Wish".Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had no idea the Jason Statham film of the same name was a remake, so I thought it was only right I see the original before, and you can definitely see this as a taste of what would come later with the same lead actor and director Michael Winner in Death Wish. Basically ageing professional hit-man and mechanic Arthur Bishop (Charles Bronson) is constantly hired to kill people leaving no traces, carefully studying his victims to get away with the perfect execution, one of his latest targets is 'Big' Harry McKenna (Keenan Wynn), who was formerly a friend of his father, Arthur is planning to retire soon after this job. At the funeral of Harry, Arthur meets Harry's son Steve (Jan-Michael Vincent), the young man asks him for a ride and they get to know each other more, he sees the twenty four year old has potential to become a professional killer, and he suggests they form a partnership, of course he realises as time passes that he is highly narcissistic and ruthless. There also comes a point later where Bishop roots through Steve's belongings and finds files about himself, and when the two are hired for a job in Italy it becomes clear that someone is out to get them, they are the targets, and this turns into a car chase, but the two hit men are able to defeat and kill their would-be assassins. In the end Steve is supposedly ready to become his own professional hit-man, but he poisons Bishop's wine as revenge for him killing his father, he was not acting on someone else's orders, but the final blow comes, literally, when Steve gets in Bishop's Ford Mustang, and Bishop has a left a note with a personal message, ending with "Bang! Your dead.", and that is when the car explodes before he can get out. Also starring Jill Ireland as The Girl/Prostitute, Linda Ridgeway as Louise - Steve McKenna's Girlfriend, Frank DeKova as The Man/Syndicate Head, Lindsay H. Crosby as Policeman and Takayuki Kubota as Yamoto. Bronson is great being the often silent and often deadly killer for hire, the most entertaining parts of the film are of course the assassination sequences and the fast paced chase moments, there are the glossy bits that slow it down slightly, but the explosions and violence more than makes up for it, it is an entertaining enough action thriller. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coldblooded assassin , Charles Bronson, teams up with protégé, Jan Michael Vincent, performing intricate "jobs" for the mafia. Eventually Bronson becomes expendable and the final third of the film is far more exciting than what precedes it. The first two thirds involves some difficult planning in order to make the contracts appear to be accidents. The movie is immediately dated to the 1970s every time Jan Michael Vincent opens his mouth with "dig it" or "hey man", however"The Mechanic" is so unpredictable that you will stay with it, and the conclusion definitely will not disappoint. I rate this higher than any of Bronson's "Death Wish" films. - MERK</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charles Bronson has a tough imagine, image that I find totally boring now, in everything he does,including the Death Wish Films.He strolls quietly and unassuming through his movies to a degree which I find frustrating, yes he gets his man, and yes he is predictable.The Mechanic served up yet another Michael Winner directed movie. This was no different.In its favour there was a twist in the end which I never saw coming.But ultimately this movie was for me a total bore.I want to like Charles Bronson following his superb performances in the Dirty Dozen, and The Great Escape, where he revealed passion and anger and frustration.But for me, since Dirty Dozen, and The Great Escape, Charles Bronson has put all that away in favour of the formula Death Wish films, which Charles Bronson strolls through as though walking in the park. The Mechanic was no exception to that rule.I apologies to all Charles Bronson fans reading this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lonely World of the Professional Assassin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A package comes. In it there is a name and photograph of someone, along with some details about where they live and work. You might know this person, you might not. Either way you study this person's life, where they go, what they like to do in their spare time, who they hang out with until you get a call that simply states something like, "we'd like you to proceed as planed" and then click. You've just been given the green light to take out your target and tale him out you will in the most efficient and cleanest way possible without getting caught because that is your job, you are "The Mechanic". Charles Bronson plays the title character here, Arthur Bishop, and creates one of the best performances of his career. With his trademark quiet but tough demeanor and cold steel eyes, Bronson is able to bring us into the treacherous world of Mr. Bishop, a highly proficient killer working for a shadowy mafia type group who takes pride in his profession and then goes back to his beautiful mansion when the job is done. But living in this world has its costs as Arthur does not have much in the way of friends and suffers from anxiety attacks, which only become worse after he is forced to kill one of the few friends he has, Harry McKeena (played by master character actor Keenan Wynn). Things start to look up a bit when Harry's son, Steve (Jan-Michael Vincent in an early but very competent performance) begins hanging out with Arthur and it doesn't take long before he takes him under his wing as his protégé. But in the world of assassins, sometimes getting close to someone can be more dangerous than the people you hunt. Even though the movie centers around a character that most would characterize as a sociopath, we come to like Arthur and can't help but be fascinated by him as he talks to Steve about his thoughts on killing and about how different societies hold certain people up as great figures of history, despite the fact that they're killers (Genghis Khan, Billy the Kid anyone?). The film is masterly directed by Michael Winner of "Death Wish" fame and is made more in the way of a thriller than it is an action movie. In other words, it's not just about explosions and violence; it's about the story and about the realities of living in an immoral world. You'll find no redemption here, which make this one of the most realistic portrayals of a hit-man ever and all leads up to an ending you won't see coming. If you're fascinated by the shadowy world of hit men and assassins or if you just want a good story, "The Mechanic" is one film you won't regret seeing. Also starring Bronson's real life wife Jill Ireland in a small but memorable role of a prostitute.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A hardened and essentially ruthless contract killer Arthur Bishop (Charles Bronson) deals with death, handing it out clean and preferably in ways which suggest natural causes or suicide. Hence whenever such a specialist 'mechanic' is needed Bishop is there for the job. Unfortunately one of his employs mark his surrogate father figure Harry McKenna (Keenan Wynn). Despite his misgivings and inner turmoil Bishop carries out the hit like a true professional. Nonetheless with the remnants of human emotionality coupled with his heightened anxiety of continuing his profession he decides to take on his son Steve (Jan-Michael Vincent) as his protégé and slowly shows him the tricks of the trade.Admittedly I only came across the Bronson original due to the miserable 2011 remake, which - however poor a picture it was - had an intriguing premise, which instilled a sense of curiosity. "The Mechanic" (1972) may feel crude and sometimes understated by modern standard, whilst various script deficiencies are starkly apparent. Nonetheless the movie is made by the rough sensitivity of Charles Bronson counterpointed by the youthful haphazard exuberance of Vincent. Together they truly interact with half-glances, muffled exchanges and a building tension between the characters. Much more dark and lacking the contrition of the remake, "The Mechanic" feels honest and direct, murky in detail, much like the self-destructive life of the hit-man, whose only solace is that of a paid hooker pretending proximity and feeling. Isolated due to profession he is not quite the empty shell exterior that his profession requires from him, but a troubled individual decreased and no longer capable to further his work. The companionship of Steve offers him respite, whilst teaching him the brutal art of murder he forms a kinship to the boy.Director Michael Winner takes Bronson and delivers a memorable cinematic gem, which despite its narrative flaws wins through the well formed characters. Something that was sadly amiss in the remake.</fullReview>

Next minute he is in a seedy part of down dressed as Bronson typically dresses and living in a dump.The dump has a pretty good view of his target. The target a guy I could kill in two minutes. Yet the kill is so elaborate you may never drink English breakfast tea again.We see that Bishop is a mess and is lonely. He relieves his loneliness by visiting a call girl who acts out a sad fantasy. Bronson is vulnerable in this movie like never before.JMV is great looking and annoying to be the perfect foil. Educated types will tell you this is "the sorcerer's apprentice".

		<fullReview>Even though I remember the ending from seeing it many years ago, I still enjoyed this movie. There were a few things about it that were of minor annoyance - the background music can be cheesy, I don't think this was a high budget affair, and the 70's fashion - well, that went out of fashion for a reason. One thing that time will never change - Jill Ireland (Mrs Charles Bronson) cannot act.**Possible Spoilers ahead** Charles is at his best in the silent, emotionless killer. Getting at the end of his game, he links up with then pretty boy Jan Michael Vincent and teaches him the trade. Crosses and double crosses help keep the tension - the old teaching the young, the need to respect the old ways - or do you? It's an oldie, a golden oldie. Not the best ever, but enjoyable and entertaining, especially for a rental. Am glad I was able to track this one down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And I thought that 'Death Wish' was the best Winner/Bronson collaboration. I was amazed at how well this movie was done for being shot in 1972. Bronson's no remorse character (Arthur Bishop) is played to perfection, a cold killing machine, who owns a beautifully luxurious home I might add. Bronson is a 'Mechanic', a trained, professional hit-man with a host of credentials and skills to prove it. Jan Michael Vincent's character 'Steve' made me really sick of him as a character from the first scene he was in and on. Young, Loud and Cocky, (all the elements that Bronson's character doesn't possess). I found it hard at first to see why Bronson would take him under his wing but after a while the character development definitely made up for that. Not a ton of action scenes, but there is just enough of everything to keep the audience satisfied, the dialogue/action scenes balance themselves out pretty well. The ending has quite a unique twist to it, but in my opinion, the ending couldn't have been done any better. I give Michael Winner a lot of credit for directing this movie, I've been told that he normally didn't get rave reviews for his work in film but The Mechanic certainly has earned a level of high praise from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Super slick entertainment from the knowing hand of director Michael Winner, with a starring part for Bronson that fits like a glove. As a professional hit-man, Bronson's only requirements are to be masterful and fix that cold-eyed squint on anything that moves, cues he learned in his sleep. Pretty-boy Vincent does his best to keep up but lacks the inner steel to be convincing, while the suicidal girl packs all the wallop of a shot of Novocaine. Still, the first twenty minutes amount to a riveting setup, perfectly defining the Bronson character and all that follows. In fact, the Louis John Carlino script comes off as a model of cunning and terseness. The film-makers even manage a judicious use of violence, until the final car chase that unfortunately can't resist the cartoon-like. And get a load of Bronson's super modern bachelor pad looking like something from Kubrick's 2001. All in all, this is one of the handful of films that turned Bronson into a 1970's Eastwood rival and continues to impress, even when projected into the more modest fireworks of today's home video.</fullReview>

(For those who care about that sort of thing, their astrological sun signs, Scorpio and Cancer, are supposed to mesh favorably). Otherwise, it is an above average diversion of the sort. The ending is considerably above average, though some might say it could be anticipated. I am surprised that the quote is not in the memorable quotes portion of the IMDb analysis.

		<fullReview>There is no "good guy" in this movie. Here, we see the deliberate, methodical doings of Arthur Bishop (Bronson), an assassin in the employ of "the organization." Along the way, he meets Steve McKenna (Vincent) who at first tries to find out what Bishop's "action" is all about. The best parts of the movie are those that show Bronson's methodical planning of each hit.There are several twists that will keep your attention, interspersed through all of the dated early '70s lingo.The editing is poor. There are times when Winner's direction is noticed, i.e. an actor running for his life and then suddenly stopping to listen to a yell from Bronson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an early '70s crime/action/thriller, so there aren't going to be an insane amount of edits and the picture is going to be more focused on fleshing out the story than giving motion sickness or temporary epilepsy. It includes some extended shots to make the viewer feel more at home than cutting right to the chase and moving from temporary place to place. There are zoom ins, interconnected shots, bell bottoms and side burns for that contemporary time stamp that it can't escape, though that doesn't take away from it being an effective character driven piece that still holds up today.The audience is introduced to the inner working of a "mechanic": someone who disposes of bad guys by making it look like an accident. Charles Bronson easily sells the part as Arthur Bishop with his rugged and tough looks, as well as a sarcastic and reserved outlook. Like he's perfectly capable of giving out harm at any time, but also has a certain amount of measurement and philosophy to what he does to make a system out of it. Bishop is a loner who doesn't show his emotions, which includes not speaking for the first fifteen minutes of the film and only first to his friend Harry (Keenan Wynn) who's having some trouble with the organization they work for. Harry knew Arthur's father well and he wants him to speak on his behalf to smooth things over, though the organization still makes their final decision by sending him a hit packet on Harry.The arrogant son named Steve (Jan-Michael Vincent) could care less of his father's passing as he was a "pusher, pimp, thief, arsonist" and precedes to be as cocky and spoiled as he was before with raging parties and no sense for responsibility. A close woman called him and said she's going to kill herself for his attention and sympathy, though instead of showing concern he arrives with Arthur to watch with morbid curiosity. This sets up the ground work and with some active pursuit on Steve's part, including doing adrenaline junky type activities together, Arthur sees that he might have it in him to do the impassive line of work he does as a mechanic and takes him under his wing as an associate and possible companion.They patiently study their target's habits and wait it out for the perfect opportunity by finding a hole in their security. They plan one way and the job goes another, leading to the organization being a little worried that Steve is on board without their permission and in turn this leaves a possibility that he might ruin what's supposed to be covert operations in the shadows, not a motocross chase during broad daylight and where witnesses can see. To smooth things over they end up in Rome, Italy to do a "cowboy job," which means their target needs to be immediately taken out at whatever the cost, accident or no accident. From what starts out as a training and character development piece with partnership in the making turns into a climactic finale with a heated shootout with car chases and explosions when the characters get pushed against a wall. If that wasn't enough a twist happens, where one of them has an ulterior motive, but like a calculated game of chess so might the other.The cinematography, music and pacing are all well timed out. More times than not the camera and music are doing more talking and sharing than the players. It gives the film a solid backdrop and a particular atmosphere with extended strings and intermittent piano to make it intriguing and put all the clandestine operations into their respective places. This has some relating factors that include skipping the court system to see deserving bad guys immediately receive justice like "Dirty Harry" ignited just a year prior. It shows someone live the high-life, make their own hours, kill with purpose, sleep with escorts without consequence, though all at a cost of not having a productive social life with some consistency and true relaxation for what's around the next corner. Charles Bronson and Jan-Michael Vincent put on interesting performances though not all of the co-stars are very notable, with some that instead perform like caricatures of their type. There is also some misplaced dry humor when most of the film is rolling with a more serious structure. This has an abrupt ending but then again it's a cold business and closes the curtains more accordingly than, say, "The Italian Job," which ended up in the air.

		<fullReview>Notable film of the excellent director Michael Winner, creator of the masterful movie "Scorpio", trying as in this movie, friendship and rivalry between two professionals, one more disenchanted and the other young and ambitious, run with vigorously, sobriety and an elegant staging as effective as fluid.Hard movie and very violent, controversy in its day by its coldness and indifference perfectly consistent with the imperturbable character of the protagonist, a brilliant personification of Bronson as conscientious "killer" outside any moral dilemma but with a hard professional ethics conflicting the narcissism and the fury of vengeful psychopathic character of Vincent.Anthological sequence pre-credits that during more than 10 minutes and without a single dialog shows the thoroughness of one of the "work" of Bronson and which is worth throughout the film displaying the irrefutable talent wasted of Winner. Topped in addition with a superb end of twisted irony to this authentic classic forgotten the cinema of action as understood in the 1970.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually knew guys who went around squeezing hunks of wax because they had seen Michael Winner's way-better-than-his-average The Mechanic and they wanted to look cool. I haven't been very nice to Winner in my reviews, but The Mechanic is a somewhere-near-great snapshot of early '70s, mechanized killer-thrillers. Winner uses his stars, Charles Bronson and Jan-Michael Vincent very effectively. If you're a guy, the movie is a cold-blooded good time, and the girls will probably find Vincent as charismatic as he is handsome.Now, The Mechanic is somewhat of a chestnut in a thematic sense--it retells the old and slipping professional, training the ambitious-to-a-new-low story and adds very little to this oft-told tale. As always with a Winner film, the production values of film quality and sound vary between acceptable and muddy sludge. What makes The Mechanic work is the sheer animal magnetism of Bronson (and a certain sympathy we feel for him as we find out more and more about his hit-man character, Arthur Bishop) and the Vincent character, who is appealing because he is a glib, handsome sociopath.Even when the movie veers toward parody, there's Bronson, a thoroughly watchable killing machine. He's able to save the movie from abject silliness with his lean and predatory performance.But the best part of the movie is the first sixteen minutes or so of film, when we first meet Arthur Bishop and watch his Mr. Goodwrench approach to killing an elderly mobster, living in a wretched flat in downtown LA, hiding in plain sight.If you've never had any interest in this type of film, watch the start and get hooked. My suggestion is to enjoy the movie, at the very least, for its snapshot into 1972 crime-drama mechanics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charles Bronson's best film ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bronson and Winner at their best. I prefer this production to the subsequent "Stone Killers" Actually, it has more in common with "The Internecine Project", a neglected gem by Ken Hughes starring James Coburn. Bronson is perfect as Bishop, an expert assassin but a very unhappy pilgrim with some serious psychiatric disorders that he barely keeps under control. As the film goes on, Bishop's professional performance starts to deteriorate eventually leading to his own proscription. Jan Michael Vincent is the second lead and very effective as an obnoxious rich-kid villain in contrast to his more usual baby-face and heart-throb castings. Keenan Wynn as "Big Harry" gives his usual impeccable support performance (he also turns up in "The Internecine Project" in a similar character role). As in most of his films, Charles Bronson does not have too much dialog to wrestle with, and so is free to concentrate on just "being Bronson" Of course, Bronson, like the stars of the silent era, doesn't NEED any dialog to make the scenes work. He was always at his best when not forced to overplay his roles. Check out his reaction when hit with a large fee by the prostitute, or his relationship with "The Man" and his pet leopard..... "That was MESSY, Mr Bishop", says "The Man", referring to a gun-down that Bishop and his new apprentice have badly botched up. Bishop may be tough and cool on the job, but he's no loose cannon hoodlum in the Bogart/Cagney tradition. He is very much the corporate cogwheel and he's certainly terrified of "The Man", knowing full well that even top hit men are in no way immune to "tragic accidents".Of the lines Bronson does have, some are short but memorable: "freaks" (when itemizing his apprentice's hobbies) and the classic, "remember, dead right or dead" We are tantalized with a few clues here and there as to how Bishop came to be what he is. A traumatized childhood with a mobster father is alluded to. Like our contemporary screen mob icon Tony Soprano, Bishop desperately needs the services of a head-shrinker. Unlike Tony Soprano, Bishop doesn't last long enough to get any therapy. When given a prescription for tranquilizers after an anxiety attack, Bishop simply throws it away. The same question is posed to the audience as in "The Sopranos"; is killing folks for a living sending the man nuts, or did he get into that unhealthy line of work because he was unbalanced in the first place?Jan Michael Vincent is actually a damned good actor, though you'd never know it from a lot of the trash he has been casted in over the years. Like a great many (most?) actors, I believe he has often sold himself well short, and has payed the price in terms of reputation. "The Mechanic" remains one of his best performances and he should have concentrated on obtaining similar roles.Apparently, this film was made with at least two alternative endings, but I've never seen the "soft" one, and the usual version where Bishop gets it from a glass of poisoned vino and Steve gets vaporised, is entirely appropriate. Homo-erotic connotations have been ascribed to the relationship between Bishop and his apprentice, and Winner tends to leave this to the viewer's interpretation. The point is made but not labored that BOTH men are seriously unbalanced and ultimately are as doomed as their targets.R. B.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Mechanic" obviously differs a lot from the usual Charles Bronson action vehicles and this is made clear immediately during the initial fifteen minutes. Charlie's character Arthur Bishop is a relentless &amp; emotionless hired killer, but simultaneously also the most duty-devoted, patient and concentrated man you've ever seen. The first &amp; completely dialog-free 15 minutes of the film is entirely dedicated to Bishop's assignment to kill an elderly man. Even though he has several possibilities to finish the job quick and dirty, he carefully observes his target's daily rituals and living environment and contemplates about nifty ways to make the eventual hit look like an accident. For one of the very first times, "The Mechanic" breaks through the somewhat stereotypical image of hired assassins and depicts them as meticulous and intelligent professionals. The film continuously remains suspenseful, unusually strange and highly compelling even after the somewhat odd opening sequences and it's probably the only film out of Bronson's heydays that is totally unpredictable and effectively shocking. The story continues with Bishop having to kill a former friend and colleague of the "organisation" he's also a part of. After the funeral Bishop befriends his targets' handsome but nihilistic-minded son Steve and sees in him the ideal associate and future successor for the job. The on screen chemistry between Bronson and Jan-Michael Vincent (cult star of "Damnation Alley" and "White Line Fever" as well as the TV-series "Airwolf") almost feels genuine and it's definitely one of the movie's strongest qualities, along with the spectacularly choreographed chase sequence. Steve's intense training as well as his first real assignment and the duo's mission to Naples are all fascinating to behold, but the most surprisingly terrific scenes are definitely those you don't expect to see in a film like this, like for example the extended part with Steve's suicidal girlfriend (proving his suitability as a hit man) and the bizarre and abrupt meeting between Bishop and a blond girl who acts out a real relationship ritual. Michael Winner's direction is much more stylish and sophisticated than usual, but there's still room for a handful of downright gratuitously violent and tasteless situations, like motorcycle races through garden parties, exploding yachts and deadly bulldozers! The climax isn't as fantastic &amp; unanticipated as most people around here claim (especially not if you're familiar with gritty 70's cinema), but it's highly pleasing and tidy. Recommended big-time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film I hated when I first saw it, because I wasn't really paying attention to what was going on, but when I saw it for the second time, I absolutely loved it! Every time I check out this movie, I'm in awe of how cool Charles Bronson is for being so calm he is no matter what is happening. This movie doesn't take up much time with b.s. scenes that are full of dialog and pointlessness. Instead, this movie gets straight to the point and has a story line that is totally awesome! The direction by Michael Winner is excellent and in my opinion is what should be emulated by current directors because the movie is very suspenseful - if you don't believe me, check out what he does with the opening scene with NO dialog. This is clearly one of Bronson's best films, and one of my favorites. Of course, if I like a movie, you know that it has to be at least kind of good because I hate every movie I see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Bronson Flick with Terrific Opening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mechanic, The (1972) *** (out of 4) Cult action picture about an aging hit-man Arthur Bishop (Charles Bronson) who prefers to work alone but even he knows that nothing lasts forever so he decides to take a young kid (Jan-Michael Vincent) under his wing and teach him the trade. Things start off smoothly until some wise guys find out and they don't appreciate Bishop bringing someone in without their permission. THE MECHANIC isn't the greatest film Bronson made during the 70s but it remains a fairly interesting one and there's no question that it features some nice performances and some very good direction. I think most people will be disappointed if they go into this film expecting a flat out action picture because it pretty much stays away from the predictable standards of the genre and instead tries to tell a real story about these two men as well as their profession. The opening sequence runs over fifteen-minutes and contains some of the best drama of any action movie from this era. There's not a line of dialogue and instead we just see Bronson stalking his target, putting his plan into action and then executing it. Director Winner does a terrific job with this sequence because he not only builds up suspense but he also manages to wink at the viewer because you expect the hit to go a certain way and then we get hit with something else. I thought the relationship between Bronson and Vincent was a pretty good one as both men sell their parts well enough and the screenplay gives them a father-son relationship that really works. Bronson was born to play this type of role and he certainly doesn't disappoint. Vincent is also quite good in his role and we even get Keenan Wynn in a quick bit and Jill Ireland shows up for one scene. Even though the film goes for a lot of drama we still get some excellent action pieces. There's quite a few gun battles and a few excellent explosions. One of the highlights is a scene where a car gets pushed off the cliff, which has to be one of the greatest examples of this from any movie in history. Cars have been going off cliffs since the silent days but the execution here and how they were able to capture it on film is just terrific. Fans of Bronson's Cannon period might be shocked to see this type of action film but it certainly has a European flavor and this works well for the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'' Careful, the student your are teaching, could very well learn too well "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1970's was a decade of drastic changes. Many of the notions we learned were surely, subtly and inexorably changed to our later dismay. The lessons we learned were often those we were warned against making and just as often what we ended up with was not to our liking. This movie " The Mechanic " was perhaps a case in point. Charles Bronson was already a up-and-coming film star and this movie set the stage for things to come. Having completed Chato's Land and The Valachi Papers he moved upwards and onwards. In this story he plays an experienced mob Hit-man named Arthur Bishop who after years of successful scores, decides to take on a brash, self confident upstart named Steve McKenna (Jan-Michael Vincent) and trains him to replace himself when he retires. McKenna learns quickly and soon joins his teacher in the field. With established stars like Keenan Wynn, Frank DeKova and Jill Ireland, the movie is nothing short of Classic drama. Lots of excitement, explosions and familiar guy action makes it a timeless work of art for many Bronson fans. Excellent rendition. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fatal Attraction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a classic 70's Bronson movie, with an added twist. The added twist would be Jan Michael Vincent's stunning and electrifying performance as Bronson's protégé. I rented this initially to see JMV, and you will not be disappointed. This is one of his earlier 70's movies, and he looks good enough to eat. His performance is great as the cold, icy, coolly seductive young man 'Steve' who works his way into Bronson's trust and eventually his profession. You can't help but notice a subtle (or not so subtle!) sexual attraction that weaves its way through the movie. Bronson's character 'Bishop' has a girlfriend he visits once in the first part of the movie. He's a very lonely and detached character. Once he sets eyes on Jan's handsome figure, you can see Bronson's 'Bishop' is hooked. Jan's 'Steve' is very persistent and pursues the lonely hit-man until Bronson finally gives in and reveals his profession. Sexual attraction is really the only explanation for Bronson character to let down his guard like this. He angers the organization who hired him by bringing Jan on board without asking permission. He reveals all his trade secrets. It could also be that he feels guilty for killing 'Steve's' father and tries to take him under his wing. This explanation would be OK, other than Vincent's simply too good looking to overlook the attraction angle. Anyway, after training 'Steve', this protégé eventually turns on Bronson in a chilling and unrepentant 'poisoning' scene at the end. It's hard to figure Jan's motives, other than he's a pure killer. But he disguises his cold-heartedness with overwhelming charm and good looks - everything that could doom the lonely Bronson character. You wonder why Vincent seduces Bronson's character in the first place - just to do him in? To take over his life, or his luxurious home? Maybe to get revenge on the obvious attraction he has for him? He seems to not care that Bronson has killed his father at the beginning of the movie. Many intriguing questions! There is also a classic car-chase scene down an Italian coastline near Naples which is just riveting. Bronson is quiet and actually very sympathetic in this movie. He looks like the classic action star in his black leather jacket, shooting up Italian cars and such! Jan's performance is excellent - using just a slight smile or look of the eyes to draw the audience in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit the main reason why I decided to check this movie out was because of the new 2011 remake of this movie. And for the most part I am glad to have checked this movie out, it's a decent movie about a cold blooded hit-man. Where the hit-man is in danger as much as his victims and he does his job in a manner where it all seems like a accident and not a assassination. In fact the first 15 minutes of it shows the hit-man's method of doing his job and there is no dialogue at all until the job is done, but the set up is done well enough to not need any dialogue for that 15 minutes. Than the movie basically revolves around the hit-man taking one of his victims son under his wings and start teaching him the ways and skills to be a hit-man. The thing is the kid that he takes under his wings just isn't all that likable from his looks to his personality. Thus the parts where the hit-man, real name Arthur Bishop shows him the ropes just wasn't that engaging or all that enjoyable. It also made me wonder why Arthur decided to make him his associate, besides the kid probably has potential. For a hit-man that is cautious and careful in his methods just didn't make much sense. But than there wouldn't be a movie since most of the plot is about a assassin teaching someone else to be a assassin. And another negative aspect of this movie is that it lacks in the action department and the script start to fall short and boring after a while. And the music is more annoying to listen to than it does it's job of building tension. Charles Bronson did a pretty good job playing a hit-man with no remorse and cold blooded as well while doing what he does best. What drives this movie is the motives of both characters, trying to guess and find out what there true intentions are for keeping each other company. It's a enjoyable movie, but didn't seem like it was crafted that well and didn't flow smoothly. Not one of the best in these type of genre but still worth checking out, there is just better films of these type out there. The ending however makes this movie unique and a worthy thriller.6.8/10</fullReview>

Knowing how to be a professional assassin is a must, but learning the secret's of a family member's death proved to be fatal. But when Vincent's character took out his mentor with poison, he should've known better than to double-cross him. At the end of the movie, he learned the hard way after he left the house. 1. He should've checked his car. 2. He should've checked his mentor out more carefully. 3. He got way too cocky for his own good. When he got into the car, and saw the note, BANG YOU'RE DEAD! So they took out each other at the end, at least the professional avenged himself after death. The novice should've been more careful: Revenge is not sweet, only messy!

		<shortDescription>Another Winner with Bronson!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though "The Mechanic" of 1972 is not my personal favorite Micheal Winner / Charles Bronson collaboration from the early 70s (that title would easily have to go to "Death Wish", with "Chato's Land" as a very close second), it is yet another gritty, solid and absolutely bad-ass Bronson flick that cult-cinema lovers should not miss. Michael Winner's films are sometimes accused by critics of being brainless revenge flicks mainly focused on ultra-violence - something that is not a flaw, in my book, but also not true in the case of Winner. This film, for example, is more subtle than your usual Bronson action flick, with a lesser emphasis on explicit violence (though the film IS violent), and a stronger focus on a complex plot and intelligent character-drawing. The almighty Charles Bronson plays hit-man Arthur Bishop (another Bronson role in which nobody else could be imagined), a cold and collected professional who gets his jobs done perfectly. The first fifteen minutes of this film are entirely without dialogue, and merely focus on Bishop preparing a hit. After having to eliminate a fellow mob member, Bishop befriends his client's son Steven McKenna (Jan-Michael Vincent) on the funeral. The ambitious young man is determined to become a hit-man himself, and seems both skilled and unscrupulous enough to become Bishop's pupil... A character played by Bronson inevitably IS Bronson, and no film in which this great man starred could therefore be imagined to be starring anybody else. This is also the case here - I couldn't imagine any other actor to fit the role of Arthur Bishop as Bronson does and, as in most of his films, Bronson is the No. 1 quality of this film. Certainly not the only quality, though, as "The Mechanic" is a gritty and very intelligent killer flick that should be appreciated by anybody who likes 70s cinema. Jan-Michael Vincent also fits very well in the role of Bishop's hit-man apprentice, and Bronson's enchanting real-life wife Jill Ireland has a small role as his girlfriend here. "The Mechanic", which also introduces several intelligent killing-techniques, profits both from a clever script, spectacular action sequences and a great photography alike. The film has some minor faults - it draws a little in the middle, and several other hit-man-films starring Bronson, such as Sergio Sollima's "Citt? Violenta" (1970) were doubtlessly better. While "The Mechanic" isn't one of my favorite Bronson flicks, it certainly is a very good one, and another fine collaboration of Michael Winner as the director and Charles Bronson as... Charles Bronson! My fellow fans of the man can not afford to miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting and often funny 70s action/buddy movie with a nice ending twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two years earlier, Bronson played a completely amoral hit-man in The Mechanic, a first class action/thriller that for the most part lacks any of the troublesome moral questions in the later film - but only because "morality" really isn't part of the equation for Bronson's Arthur Bishop, a high-priced "mechanic" who ends up taking on younger, cockier and too-enthusiastic Steve McKenna (Jan-Michael Vincent, less wooden than usual here) as his protégé shortly after he kills McKenna's father (the always wonderful Keenan Wynn).The best part of this film is the opening set-up as we see Bishop calmly and methodically set up an extremely complicated hit in an apartment building in New York, staging it from across the street. He goes about the job very much as a calm man of business, and one of the neatest aspects of the film to me is that while he never really loses the facade, it's clear that in taking on young McKenna - who he has formed a bond with over a couple of social outings after the older McKenna's funeral - he has allowed a potentially fatal emotional relationship to obscure his clear vision.The film is basically structured as a series of fairly elaborate action set pieces with the developing relationship between the older and younger assassins taking place in between. All of the action sequences are very well put together and play out in some interesting and unexpected ways; after the opening scene my favorite is probably the motorcycle race which comes a little over halfway through the film, fascinating in part because it's Bronson who takes off after the escaping victim and not the expected speed-freak Vincent.I don't want to spoil the ending, which has one of the funnier twists I've seen in any action movie, so I'll just say that I for one never saw the last couple of scenes coming. As noted above in regards to Death Wish, Winner really knows how to plot a simple, linear action piece for all it's worth and without allowing too many distractions to creep in. The music, even more excellent than in the later film, sounded to me like Jerry Goldsmith in experimental-percussive Planet of the Apes mode, but in fact it is by Jerry Fielding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ingredients were there, and the whole thing comes up just short of being a successful picture. That is perhaps the most frustrating scenario for this critic to watch play out before him. Here we had Charles Bronson working as a hit-man, a cocky young stud as his apprentice, and Michael Winner at the helm. Lots of stunts, plenty of carnage, but something is just barely missing. I'm not sure why it didn't completely satisfy me. Perhaps my expectations were just too high after seeing Death Wish so recently....The story centers around Charles Bronson as a resourceful, yet lonely and aging hit man. He is 44, single, no relatives that he speaks to, and really nothing to do except sip wine, admire his fancy home, and kill the occasional man. At first it looks like we are being introduced to his girlfriend in one scene. His wife Jill Ireland warmly greets him when he shows up at her door, and promptly reads him a love letter and then takes him to bed. We find out in the very next scene that she is in fact a high-end prostitute. It was all role-playing. Weird! The actual story gets going after Bronson carries out a hit on a long-time colleague. At the man's funeral, he starts up a conversation with the man's cocky son, and the two soon discover they share the same interests when it comes to murder. The young man, played fairly well by Jan-Michael Vincent, wants to learn to be a hit man himself. And Bronson sees this as an opportunity to perhaps pass on his craft to the son he never had. Or maybe just finally have someone to talk to. Hard to really say.The film has an eye-opening scene where a young lady friend of Vincent's slashes her wrists wide open and tells him she's going to bleed to death unless he helps her. Bronson is also there. She asks him how long it will take. He asks her weight. 110, she tells him. Bronson explains that it will take 2 1/2 to 3 hours for her to die. At first she will begin to feel cold, and then drowsy. Soon after it will be all over. Neither Vincent nor Bronson seem interested in helping her. They kind of sit back with mild curiosity to and see if the young woman has the nerve to do it. The scene kind of cops out and we find out that she doesn't in fact have the nerve. It looks like we are being set up for a nice psychological thriller, perhaps.Unfortunately, once the two men begin working together, the film settles down into a series of rather pedestrian action sequences. This is a damn shame. Even changing the setting to Italy does little to spice things up in the last half hour. After a while we learn that Vincent and Bronson seem to have been hired to kill each other. Or maybe both men are supposed to die. The film does keep you guessing a little, and the conclusion has a nice twist. Imagine that! M. Night Shamalamadingdong didn't invent the "big twist" concept in the 1990s! And HE was supposed to be the "next Spielberg"!!! But I digress. You will probably give the film an extra star or two just for the ending. I know I did. 6 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I never realized that murder of a single criminal required one thousand skills and months of planning.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TM is a somewhat odd action film. The first 15 minutes are without dialogue (not unusual for an action film), which may not surprise given that this is a Charles Bronson movie. After the slow start that ends with a predictable explosion, then we have another murder and then a half hour of almost nothing happening; in this section Bronson and Vincent grow from being vague acquaintances to partners to... lovers. Just kidding... I have no idea why their relationship is so odd, the dialogue being rather weird and pointless much of the time.While Bronson as usual has very good screen presence, Vincent, though essentially somewhat charismatic, disappoints as a total amateur. Some of his line-delivery was like watching a Z-movie. The director must have been sleeping in his chair.Another odd aspect is the overly complicated way Bronson plans his victims' deaths. I've heard of NASA missions to Mars that took less time to develop. Even Kate Moss doesn't take as much time to take in her daily 1000 lines of the white powder up her pretty little nose. And even Orson Welles would finish one of his mammoth luncheons before Bronson would FINALLY find the ideal way to kill his victim. What's with all those photographs? Even the paparazzi don't make as many shots. I guess Bronson's character could have used a lesson or two from the Sopranos: with them it's quick and simple...The ending also baffles me. Why would Bronson allow himself to be poisoned by Vincent when he knew of the latter's intent to kill him? Why didn't he kill him sooner? Or are we supposed to think that Bronson had a secret death-wish, that he wished to die? Hmm...Still, the last third makes up for some of the movie's more pointless scenes, such as Jill Ireland's one - and only - appearance. What was that about? Just to show that Bronson wasn't gay? Her character had no purpose; it was just a way for Bronson to get her into one of his movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Charles Bronson's Classic Movies!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before "Scorpio" director Michael Winner and action star Charles Bronson teamed up to make the classic vigilante thriller "Death Wish," they collaborated on the all-time best professional gun for hire movie "The Mechanic." Actually, "The Mechanic" was their second movie; initially, they worked together on the Spanish-lensed, cowboys versus Indians melodrama "Chato's Land," about a wrongly accused Native American chased by a bigoted posse. Methodical and detail oriented to the hilt best describes the eponymous protagonist that Bronson plays in this contemporary crime classic. Quite simply, Arthur Bishop (Charles Bronson) is a top-notch assassin who analyzes his victims and then devises a means of disposing of them so that their deaths resemble accidents. The most distinctive thing about Bronson's performance is his long hair and his "Charlie's Angel's" way of flipping if off his forehead. This simple gesture speaks volumes about his character.Incredibly enough, the Lewis John Carlino created "The Mechanic" originally as a portrait of two homosexual assassins but nobody wanted to touch the script, including Cliff Robertson or George C. Scott so that by the time that Bronson got his hands on it all traces of homosexuality had been expunged. Had there been the least hint of homosexuality in the narrative, director Michael Winner wrote in his autobiography, Bronson would have shunned starring in this crisply made, white-knuckled suspense film. Hollywood veteran Keenan Wynn and rising star Jan-Michael Vincent co-starred with Bronson. According to Winner, Bronson refused his first choice of Richard Dreyfus as his co-star. Nevertheless, although Bronson approved casting Vincent, neither star liked the other."The Mechanic" opens in Los Angeles as our anti-heroic protagonist cases an individual living in hiding, and he concocts the perfect way to kill the guy without arousing suspicion. Arthur Bishop is the epitome of patience. He watches every move his victim makes and then breaks into his apartment, tampers with the gas-burning stove with a substance that will release the gas into the air, substitutes teabags with a knock-out drug and conceals another substance in a book that he will shoot from the apartment across the street. The victim comes home and brews tea as part to his daily routine. The narcotic in the tea knocks him out while the substance in the stove eats through the piping and gas fills the room. Bishop fires his rifle at the book with the substance in it and an explosion obliterates the apartment!Bishop performs hits for the mafia. He answers his phone and receives his orders from a raspy voice. It seems that Bishop's father organized this criminal syndicate. One of his father's friends?'Big Harry' MacKenna (Keenan Wynn of "The War Wagon")?pleads with Bishop to intercede on his behalf with the mob. When Arthur meets 'Big Harry,' he encounters 'Big Harry's' son, Steve (Jan-Michael Vincent of "Defiance"), an arrogant, unfeeling twentysomething lacking in sympathy. Bishop's efforts don't work and the mob hires him to ice 'Big Harry.' Since he knows 'Big Harry' has a heart condition, Bishop takes him to the beach at dusk for a rendezvous. Suddenly bullets start flying at 'Big Harry' and he thinks the mob and not Bishop is firing the shots. Eventually, 'Big Harry' suffers a heart attack and dies. Later, Bishop runs into Steve at 'Big Harry's' funeral. Unfazed by his father's death or the thought of eternity, Steve quips callously, "I've always been interested in primitive rituals like tucking the dead away." When Steve inquires about Bishop's connection with his late father, Bishop explains that his father and 'Big Harry' were friends. Eventually, Steve bugs Bishop enough that he takes Steve on as an apprentice. At one point, to show our anti-hero's vulnerability, he collapses at an aquarium and an ER doctor diagnoses him with acute anxiety syndrome. Arthur teaches Steve the racket and explains that "everybody has his jelly spot.' They have to kill a guy running cocaine. Something goes wrong and one of the coke villains escapes on a motorcycle and Arthur chases him and inevitably plays an unlikely role in the pusher's death. The mob doesn't like what Arthur has done in taking on Steve, but Arthur insists that they may need another killer. They assign them to kill a guy in Naples. This is the high point of the film as our heroes scuba out to a yacht to blow it up and find it empty. They reach the beach and a careening car chase ensues. The double-header ending at Arthur's motel room and later when Steve arrives back in Los Angeles is dazzling! Despite their dislike for each other, Bronson and Vincent make a good, believable combo. Jerry Fielding's tense music generates lots of atmosphere. Clocking in at a trim 100 minutes, "The Mechanic" never wears out its welcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film starts very slowly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mechanic becomes fairly exciting in the last 15 minutes. Before that, it's a slow burn that is occasionally boring. There is a drab atmosphere that pervades the film and combines with the restrained acting of the leads to give the production a muted feel. Perhaps that was intentional given that their characters are calm, controlled hitmen, but it doesn't necessarily make for interesting viewing. Bronson is given some good lines and is admittedly effective at conveying a man with feelings boiling under the surface. Without using words, he gives the viewer the impression that his aging hitman character is troubled over his past deeds or empty life, and he subtly reveals hints of happiness when he finds a protege. Jan Michel Vincent as the protege shows none of this depth, but his approach is perfectly suited to the shallow, psychopathic brat that he plays. Anyway, most of the film is spent with Bronson as he goes through what have now become run-of-the-mill hitman/crime film cliches like meeting crime bosses in lavish estates, meticulous planning of hits (some of which are clever), and living a lonely lifestyle at home. None of it is truly exceptional (through modern eyes anyway) and the music is straight out of a late 70s or early 80s television mystery show with its sudden, short blasts of horns or bells. Finally, in the last section of the film, they change gears and the viewer is provided with a well-paced and taut action sequence. It's nothing that would amaze a contemporary viewer, but it is well constructed and the strong pacing comes through still after all these years.Overall, The Mechanic is nothing you need to run out and see, but it does have its charms for fans of hitman films or dark thrillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shallow action film is deep on the Bronson touch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE MECHANIC is best noted for Charles Bronson's trademark character as an anti-hero, and an assassin who gets the job done right. Was this Michael Winner's inspiration for DEATH WISH? Perhaps so, because the depth of the story is what counts, but it feels like putting off sensitive action buffs is the easy part. While more action would be a blessing, the best interest lies within Bronson's partnership of Jan-Michael Vincent. There is one simple solution to appreciate this: save your appetite for later. The events that surrounds "The End" will never be the same once you experience it, and it's worth the entire movie all in one piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bronson is Bronson, which is what makes the movie so good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mechanic opens up with one of those practically dialog-free group of scenes that can just floor the willing and attentive viewer. Bronson goes into a small apartment and sets up shop, so to speak, for a contract killing. We see him calmly and with total care break into someone's apartment, rig the gas to go off at a precise moment, and trigger the detonation in a book. Then it's a matter of waiting for the precise moment in the middle of the night, and then the strike, which comes as a BANG that sends a message in the guise of an accident. The Mechanic is a nickname for a hit-man, in this case a highly skilled one like Bronson's character who does a lot of research and back-up. From the opening moments this looks to be like an action movie with a lot of intelligent storytelling behind it (while not without some of the music one expects in a 70s action movie ala Dirty Harry-lite, it does come close to something like the chilly perfection of a Melville film in the opening moments.But, sadly, the rest of the film doesn't quite live up to the fantastic beginning. It soon turns into a mentor/pupil story where Bronson at first befriends and then takes under his wing a young man (Jan Michael Vincent) who's father was once a business associate of Bronson's father who just died. The director, Michael Winner, sets up some nifty and exciting action scenes, particularly with a motorcycle chase that seems timed to the note, and to another chase as the climax set in Italy. And Bronson is Bronson, after all, one of the most unlikely but brutal bad-asses on the planet, who with one look can send chills down grown-men's spines. Jan Michael Vincent, however, is far weaker a figure by comparison, with barely one-note to his performance as the young upstart who, oddly enough, isn't even given much of an explanation by the elder Mechanic as to why he's being taken under tutelage. Maybe it was a whim, or sympathy.It's a professionally crafted picture, very 70s, and it has a good star performing good action and so-so dialog. It's worth your time but it's not a must-see; Mr. Majestyk is more fun, and Death Wish more essential (sure, there's a rubber ball Bronson squishes in this film as his bad-ass prop, but it's no match for a sock-o-quarters).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My view of THE MECHANIC (1972)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw The Mechanic on TV last night. Bronson is at his unsentimental best, as Arthur Bishop. The opening "hit" is fascinating to watch, viewers have no attachment for the victim. (nice to see an American tea drinker!)Jan Michael Vincent gives the film contrast and added appeal. Could he prove even more callous than the master? I liked the shift to Naples, Italy. Some critics seem to find the Mechanic hard to follow. A lack of motivation is a problem: why do these independently wealthy men need to be hired killers! Character development is minimal. Bronson doesn't flinch throughout. Some scenes are certainly exciting, and it's a little reminiscent of 1971's Get Carter. A nasty film in some respects, the final scene gets your motor running!

		<shortDescription>THE MECHANIC (Michael Winner, 1972) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years, I've missed out on this one more than I care to remember. Now that I've caught up with the film, I can't say I was that taken with it! Not that the film has any solid reputation or anything but, given that it was made during Charles Bronson's 1970s heyday and, out of his six collaborations with Winner the one I wasn't yet familiar with, I found it rather underwhelming if still quite watchable in a sub-POINT BLANK (1967) fashion. As a matter of fact, Keenan Wynn plays a similar role here ? although, in this case, he is dispatched very early on by his old pal Bronson. The film tries to inject some meaning into its portrayal of a hit-man's everyday life, but it's nowhere near as compelling as Jean-Pierre Melville's definitive LE SAMOURAI (1967). Still, it does have the required quota of well-handled action sequences including the opening dialogue-free 15 minutes in which Bronson meticulously (and spectacularly) 'executes' one of his victims. Some have also praised the film's double-twist ending, but I wasn't that impressed by it either! On top of it all, most of the time the viewer has also got to contend with the elusive acting abilities of Jan-Michael Vincent who as Bronson's cocky protégé is certainly no match for the latter's quiet authority.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been better ? the Winner effect makes it an average 70's thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aging hitman Bishop takes on Steve McKenna as an apprentice ? although it also helps his loneliness to have someone else around. The two carry out jobs together, however an organisation that doesn't forgive mistakes, greed and a debt of honour bound by murder mean that things don't stay simple for long.The story here is pretty simple, and really nothing new (Vincent has done several films where he plays an apprentice type to an aging expert). However what makes this interesting is the relationship between Bishop and McKenna ? is it a sort of father/son thing, is it a guilt thing or is it just loneliness? However this side of it is lost in lots of slow quiet scenes (that Winner obviously meant to be `tense') and lost of noisy `hits'. This makes it quite run of the mill and it doesn't seem to start moving until the last 20 minutes ? although the ending is quite good (but messed up by the abrupt rolling of the credits).Bronson can do strong/silent in his sleep ? but what he can't do well is emotion. Here he has a lot to work with, he does OK but I felt the character would have been more in someone else's hands. Likewise Vincent is a little too flash, he's good but again you left wanting more from him. For a film so reliant on two men for all the action and story, I expected that they would have done better.For a Winner film this ranks as one of his best, however as a film this is just above average. For many, the lack of character development and lack of tension will prove to be a real disappointment. This suggests it has more to deliver than it actually does.</fullReview>
