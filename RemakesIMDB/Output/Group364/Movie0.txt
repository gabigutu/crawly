		<shortDescription>Pretty Much Perfect for 1967 ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sadly, and quite rudely, leask81 seems to have got it all wrong. The Plank was made in 1967 by some of the finest British comedians of the day - 'poms' or not. His comment was posted in February 2006 so, quite naturally, it would seem out-dated. In fact, any viewing later than 1976 would ... have you tried watching Paul Hogan's early stuff?The sheer enjoyment out of watching the story of this errant plank of wood and its two clumsy handymen is not only a gem of British comedy, but is also a bar over which not many comedy performers since then have managed to clear.A highly enjoyable 'short' and one for the collector.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a Landmark "Best of British" feel-good mini-film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just happened to tape "The Plank" when it was last shown on British terrestrial television (BBC2 5/12/95) and I've held onto this treasure ever since! My family and I love it to bits.We are however die-hard British 50s/60s/and 70/s-silent film fans, e.g. Futtock's End/A Home of Your Own/Rhubarb Rhubarb etc.etc. One of the main appeals of it is that you don't have to listen to it-it's very easy to watch if you've got young kids doing their own thing in the room with you.(they'll look up every now and then and laugh at certain bits). There is now available a DVD of "The Plank" Uncut which comes out at 51 Min's allegedly; this must go some way to outlining it's obvious popularity. I definitely do not prefer the 70's T.V. remake of this as it is so obviously a dumbed down/going through the motions version.The original is the dog's ........! There is however an interesting angle about the re-make and that is several of the original locations have been re-visited so I habitually acknowledge them all each time I view the re-make(Is that sad or good?) Just had to write an uplifting review as the first review doesn't do this justice and is a tad unfair to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very funny, later remade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This short is very reminiscent of the antics of many of the early silent film stars. Eric Sykes remade this piece in 1979, this time with Arthur Lowe (of Dad's Army and Mr. Men fame)in the role of the larger worker. Whichever version you choose to see, both Lowe and Cooper are very funny to watch, so you really can't go wrong no matter which you view.Things like the car doors that must be closed at the same time to prevent the other popping open, and narrowly avoiding hitting people when they swing the plank around are straight from the realm of Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd or even Laurel and Hardy. So if you like classic physical comedy and sight gags, in the vein of the classics, then find a version of The Plank and enjoy with a friend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>British comedy at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a hilarious piece of nonsense from a cast of very talented actors/comedians. Eric Sykes is one of the greatest comedy actors/writers that Britain has produced and this film should not be slated because it seems dated by todays standards (it was made over 40 years ago). The plot is simple, the story is simple, but the simplicity of it is its charm. It is a film purely designed to entertain and to make one laugh, it has no message or underlying agenda, other than to bring a smile to people of all ages and nationality. The cast are all masters of their craft, the pick of the 60's comedians, and all 'proper' comedians, they did not have to resort to shock tactics and foul language to get the audiences attention, unlike todays comics. It seems to have stood the test of time, for few people have never heard of it and it has often been referred to a a 'British Classic' .... and deservedly so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is actually quite good. Eric Sykes and Tommy Cooper are brilliant. But I would say this film is not one I would buy but one that is good to watch on TV.A myriad of stars usually mean a film is rubbish but this film proves wrong. The stars all have funny little cameo roles that keep you going "ooh I know him" and having to go here to look for them!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest British films of the last 50 years, no ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film such as this shows that something can be funny without resorting to swearing to get a laugh. Also showing in the process that you don't even need to speak to have a giggle. Question: What is the most basic joke on the planet? Answer: Someone slips on a banana skin. For if you have no language, then the joke is funny the world over. This is the reason why characters such as Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean and Charlie Chaplin's tramp are universally popular and why performers like Jerry Lewis and Norman Wisdom are so adored in the countries of France and Albania respectively, when they can't speak a word of Albanian or French.The Plank is a master class in comedy from Messrs Sykes and Cooper. The timing is impeccable throughout and their constant fight not only with the legendary plank but also with their car and all manner of obstacles is hilarious.The cameos are never-ending: Jimmy Edwards, Roy Castle, Jimmy Tarbuck, Hattie Jacques, Bill Oddie! The list goes on and on! One major thing to remember is that there was no script. Let me just repeat that. There was no script! Everything you see was translated straight from Eric Sykes's brain onto film. Here is his explanation in an interview on the South Bank Show, talking to Melvyn Bragg: "How can you write a visual gag? You just can't."(Please feel free to correct me as I'm writing the quote from memory and as such I may have paraphrased.)A comedic film is supposed to make you laugh, does The Plank achieve this? Like heck it does! Hilarious! Riotous! Side splitting!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has not stood up well to the test of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had found this one of the most hilarious things I had ever seen when originally viewed in the late-1960s/early-1970s and I had wondered for years why it was not shown more regularly on British TV. Finally got to see it again when it was tucked away at 11.00 pm - midnight on pre-Christmas viewing schedule. Having now re-watched it, I now know why it enjoys so few showings as it just does not cut it any more. Tommy Cooper is still hilarious (as he always was) just through his physical presence and personality and Jim Dale's appearances and the effects of these are also amusing. Otherwise, though, there is very little going for it. Most of the gags are so predictable you can see them coming miles away and the added tinned laughter others have commented on is just ghastly. The main problem, I found, though was that the TIMING was just atrocious to modern eyes. Sykes was very obviously trying to recreate ( could one say milk?) the heritage of classic stars such as Chaplin, Lloyd and, above all, Laurel &amp; Hardy but does not come within five miles of their talent, especially the latter pair. I think any modern audience (of any age) will find more hilarity and deep belly laughs in virtually any Laurel &amp;Hardy short than in this offering, which now really does belong in the museum of British comedy on film and is only really suitable for viewings by scholars of the genre and others like me (hence the rating) looking back on a much more innocent age and stage of their lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old-fashioned comedy short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A short, slapstick British comedy from the late '60s. Be warned that there's also a remake from 1979 with Arthur Lowe in the Tommy Cooper role. The main inspiration behind THE PLANK seems to be the silent comedies of yesterday and the early talkies that followed, particularly the Laurel &amp; Hardy film where they starred as a couple of workmen.THE PLANK is fun, albeit slightly overstated. It doesn't have the feel of a timeless classic to it, and for the most part it goes through the motions with all kinds of predictable humour. Saying that, there are quite a few decent gags, particularly those involving the plank being tied to the top of a car and all the accidents and incidents that ensue.The film is well worth watching for fans of classic British comedy, because the cast is a veritable who's who of famous names. Tommy Cooper, as one of the two central workmen, is by far the best value, essaying a kind of naturalistic humour that never seems force. Beside him, as straight man, Eric Sykes seems almost staid.Look out for Roy Castle in an ill-fitting wig, short cameos for Jim Dale and Hattie Jacques, plus plenty of other notables from the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less Than The Sum Of Its Parts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie at the cinema long ago. In fact, it was so long ago that the main feature still included a B-movie companion. And here 'The Plank' was it. Oddly; I can remember this, but not the A-movie it supported.Eric Sykes' effort included a who's-who of British comedy from the time. Each of them become involved at some stage or another with this plank of wood in a series of banal set-piece gags. Frankly, I found it childishly contrived even then. Which is probably why I remembered it. Some 20 years later I saw it on television and the stunts were quite painful to behold. Sphincter-puckering is the term.It's a sort-of silent movie. It might even pass for surrealism at times. But the idea doesn't quite work. If the French had done this, I suspect the result would have been an absolute scream. But it's not the kind of concept we Brits are particularly good at. And this is the proof.There's the cream of comic talent at the director's disposal. Any one of several could have a theatre rolling in the aisles; but here they, and their unique skills, are each subordinated to Sykes' old-fashioned brand of predictable variety-hall humour, and they are simply wasted.Although it was released in 1967, it represented a simplistic, juvenile 'take' that had pretty-well run its course 10 years earlier. As nice a bloke as he was, Eric Sykes was a comedian who simply couldn't move with the times. If he were in light entertainment even today, this is still the stuff he would be producing. By 1969 came 'Monty Python', with modern comedians and fresh comedy. Both styles observed back-to-back represent two different generations yet separated by just 2 years.As a chance to play 'spot the comedian' this item is a quiz in itself, but as comedic entertainment it's a bit of a disaster, unless you're under 5 years old. I suspect they'll love it in Albania.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two short planks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this British comedy short from the mid-60's. Although just before my time, Tommy Cooper and to a lesser degree Eric Sykes could reasonably make me laugh on their TV variety or sit-com shows plus I came to this piece after watching a rather fawning TV biography of the recently deceased Sykes containing eulogies of praise from the surprising likes of Eddie Izzard, Michael Palin and others. Sykes wrote and directed this off-beat, near-silent short move about two dozy workmen's encounter with a plank of wood and peopled it with friends and colleagues of the time, including the inevitable Hattie Jacques and Jimmy Edwards, but also in small parts if you closely enough the likes of Bill Oddie, Jim Dale and Jimmy Tarbuck. But the humour really is quite dated. Sykes makes reasonable use of running gags but the sketch-like sequences often run on too long and much of the material is somewhat predictable and stilted, even resorting lazily to sexism as a young female hitch-hiker gets manhandled for her trouble.In its favour, the hitch-hiker section notwithstanding, the humour is clean, gentle and inoffensive. I didn't really think Cooper and Sykes gelled together in their roles as two chippies off the old block and while I acknowledge the debt paid to Sykes comedy heroes of the Silent Era, most obviously Laurel and Hardy, there the comparison ends, indeed I was reminded more of Crackerjack's Peter Glaze and Don MacLean (now they were my era!), hapless double-act more than the immortal Stan and Ollie.The film's a nice little document of old-school comedy of a bygone age but sad to say it hasn't aged well and in truth is more a museum piece nowadays than genuine entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It might be dated but it's still silly, harmless fun - 70%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among those of a certain age and era, this is a well-regarded classic comedic short. It's definitely not short of star power as most of Britain's comic talent at the time is in here somewhere. But sadly, it hasn't aged well. Nothing wrong with the actual comedy which is mainly the sort of physical shtick the likes of Tommy Cooper were perfect at. No, it's more to do with the feel of the film which comes across as very old fashioned. This may put modern viewers off but there are plenty of simple laughs to be had.Cooper and writer/director Eric Sykes play a couple of workmen who are trying to place floorboards down. Needing just one more plank to complete the job, they head off in their unreliable van to collect one and bring it back to the building site. Sounds simple enough but chaos ensues when the plank causes all manner of misunderstandings with the locals as well as attracting the attention of the local constabulary (Jimmy Edwards).While not a truly silent movie, "The Plank" is a mostly dialogue-free tribute to the likes of Laurel &amp; Hardy, Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton. It certainly feels like a traditional silent movie and the comedy is very reminiscent of those types of films. But "The Plank" makes a couple of errors - a dated recording of "Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush" is repeated often and doesn't do the film any favours. And while the film makes the most of its premise, it does feel predictable and the visual gags can be seen coming a mile off. There are genuinely funny moments such as Sykes trying to close the van's troublesome door and "The Plank" deserves credit for trying to be something different. But it is very much of its time and it is worth remembering that when watching it. It might not be the classic it was once hailed as but you'd be a plank not to give it a try. In fact, you can even watch it for free on this very website...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Plankful of Trouble</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Plank is a slap stick short featuring Eric Sykes and Tommy Cooper. Sykes wrote and directed this nearly silent short film and managed to get an all star cast. Keep you eyes peeled for Stratford Johns, Roy Castle, Jim Dale, Jimmy Tarbuck, Hattie Jacques, Graham Stark, Jimmy Edwards, John Junkin and other familiar faces of the 1960s and 1970s.Sykes and Cooper are two workmen, when one of them uses the last floorboard for heating and they go out to buy a replacement. They return to the house with the plank on top of a van, but the journey is fraught with unexpected difficulties. The short film is a series of slapstick routines involving the plank and featured guest stars.However some of the scenes do not quiet work and go on for too long such as driving around and trying to get out of the timber yard. Also the scenes with the female hitchhiker in the truck now looks distasteful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched this film many times now and it still makes me laugh.the main thing i like is that it has no swearing in it....well lets be true here....there is not much talk at all.i have loved both Sykes and coopers work for many years and this is not the best but they both seem to be enjoying what they are doing.i love the film from the start with the laughter in the timber yard right up to the end as they both pull up the floor boards they just put in.you will have to see the rest to know what happens.the cast list is impressive even for today.about 20 comic names to boot.and the story is so simple that a child of 3 could get it (i know my youngest son has watched it too and has laughed) yes it is showing its age but if you just let that go you have a very good "silent?" movie that will offend nobody</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People should know there are 2 versions of The Plank</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Plank by Eric Sykes is one of my favourite Comedy Shorts so I was very glad when I found that a DVD version was available - that is until I actually bought one with the intention of replacing my ageing copy of The Plank on VHS tape.Unfortunately I found the DVD was not the version I had gotten used to and despite having Eric Sykes and Jimmy Edwards repeating their TV roles, this DVD seems to be aimed at a cinema audience with an IQ of zero since the film Tittles are accompanied by a stupid laughter sound track which is both overbearing and unnecessary but seems to have been added in case people didn't know they were about to watch a comedy.The DVD is clearly based on the the same script as the TV version available on VHS Cassette but there are many small changes which somehow conspire to cause most of the jokes, which are very funny with the VHS cast, to fall flat and as mentioned before, the sound track irritates rather than complements.I find the VHS version to be extremely funny and if you like British Humour and enjoy trying to name all the people involved, you will find the VHS tape is packed with well known faces from TV, Film and Sport.For me the highlight is Charlie Drake failing to deliver a cake but it's also fun to see Diana Dors sending herself up - as she used to in later life when she lost her slender shape - in fact I just cannot watch this film without getting a very broad grin on my face.It was very disappointing to find this DVD was NOT of the TV production and in my opinion it is an unsympathetic production. Though similar in content to the Charlie Drake version it just doesn't manage to rise to the same level of comedy and the sounds over tittles on the DVD makes me cringe and want to turn it off without even watching it.I genuinely urge anyone who has only known this DVD to try and see the VHS version before concluding that The Plank is not a very funny film indeed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just recently found a copy of "The Plank" I didn't know I had, I watched it and discovered that, yes, as one reviewer as wrote, it was good for it's time. The gags are slightly hammered home a little, but it does have it's place as a british short, describing: What times were like back then, in reality and as a movie industry. Eric Sykes is a clever comic actor whose timing is quite nice to watch, but here Tommy Cooper is more or less wasted. The colour and look of the film, give the impression that it was done by a die-hard Jacques Tati fan. Overall, innocent, good for it's time and (without patronizing) worth a look if your elderly relatives want a giggle if you can't find your Mr Bean Tapes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, this isn't a new starring vehicle for Keanu Reeves; it's a chirpy, cheesy British homage to the slapstick era.Though quite admirable for it's time, thirty-three years later The Plank has dated somewhat. This is the sort of comedy where you hear breaking window sound effects (though don't get to see the cracked window) and comedy music, cute cats and yapping dogs take a part. Tommy Cooper was a very amusing man who knew how to time a joke, so it's perhaps a waste of his ability to cast him in a nearly silent role.One pleasant thing about the film is that it is, apart from one or two light examples of sexism, entirely innocent, and can be watched by all ages. (Though look out for the newspaper advertisement for The News of the World, not covered up, which reads: "Pop Stars and Drugs"). Perhaps another example of this dated style is that the three black cast members all play dustbinmen.This was probably highly amusing stuff at the time, but looked back upon it doesn't really stand up. Seeing men jumping with rage till their false teeth fall out, or a man being pulled along by a car isn't that funny anymore. In fact, I remembered this film being a hell of a lot funnier than it patently is, and had my memory jogged by the IMDb: it turns out this is the first time I've actually seen the film, and I was thinking of Sykes' work for television in the late seventies/early eighties, which included Rhubarb, Rhubarb and a TV remake of this film starring Harry H.Corbett and Charlie Drake. Maybe that's why I was so disappointed as the '79 version obviously brought this tired format up to date, and, by all accounts, halved the overlong run-time.Ultimately The Plank can only be watched in it's own era. If you wanted the greatest silent comedy then you'd look to the more professional standards of the 20s and 30s (sound dubbing is quite poor here). And if you wanted to laugh at Eric Sykes holding a plank, then you'd watch the remake with it's laughter track half-way convincing you it's funny. For the '67 version there's the feeling that all of its heavily signposted gags don't have the pay-off they deserve, or that the pace isn't quite right. This was a time when The Beatles, The Stones and Dylan were redefining music. In the meantime, Jimmy Edwards was getting excited at young girls in miniskirts. But nevertheless, as a historical document, it's okay, one for a rainy afternoon when there's nothing else on. 5/10.</fullReview>
