		<shortDescription>Immensely enjoyable caper with sympathetic as well as adventurer kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young girl (Kristen Stewart) and her two teen friends pull off a bank heist for obtaining the cash needed for the operating her ill daddy (Sam Robards) where their mild-mannered mummy (Jennifer Beals) works as a security agent . They encounter complications with a humorous and botcher pair agents (James LeGros) in a robbery developed with imposing tension and intrigue ; it's , of course , the highlight and great climax of the movie . Thus , during the burgle the teens confront perils and risks as high-tech systems , vigilance dogs and she will raise a vault suspended many feet above ground (similar to Tom Cruise in Mission impossible) with the aim to take million of dollars from the safe .The picture displays comedy , action , enjoyable humor and continuous entertainment . Besides , galore kart chases with impressive velocities and pursuits by police cars . The film is a crossover of ¨Topkapi¨ caper, ¨Ocean's eleven¨ heist pirouette and ¨Italian job¨ races but wrapped in adolescent style . Likable acting from Kristen Stewart , Jennifer Beals and Max Thieriot's film debut . The picture contains a lively and jolly musical score by George S. Clinton . The movie was regularly directed by Bart Freudlich and turned out to be a remake of a Danish hit smash titled Klatret?sen . It's a great stuff for schoolboys of all ages though especially for kids and teenagers .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I recommend this movie as a fun and touching movie for the whole family to see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catch That Kid, an enjoyable movie for the whole family? I think so. The story is about a young girl named Maddy, a tomboy who loves climbing. Her parents, however, have forbidden her to climb due to an accident her father had had which seriously injured his back. Though he had apparently recovered, something goes wrong which leaves him paralyzed from the neck down. Maddy's mother Molly does everything she can to find the money needed - $250,000 - for an opperation to save him. But there is nothing she can do. Maddy, still determined to save her dad, sees robbing the bank at which her mother is setting up a security system as her only option. She quickly enlists the help of her two best friends - Gus, a go-cart mechanic and Austin, a computer geek - who both happen to be in puppy love with her. What ensues as they make their plan to rob the bank and begin to carry it out is funny, incredibly unrealistic, and touching.Most of the humor comes from the two boys' crush on Maddy, the wannabe actor who works at the bank, and later the fact that Maddy is left in charge of her little brother at the last minute and decides to take him with her to the robbery. I would have liked to see more humor, and the slapstick comedy from the security officer was not very funny. Nevertheless, the movie overall was fun.The movie is unrealistic, but I like it that way, because in reality life is complicated and hard, but in movies everything is possible. I also enjoyed the hi-tech security measures employed at the bank, very nifty.The touching scenes come in where Maddy shows her deep love for her father and learns how very deep her mother's love is for her.The movie did not, however, teach any real moral values. That is, of course, easily remedied by talking to your children about right and wrong and the real consequences of choosing actions you know are wrong.I recommend this movie as a fun movie for the whole family to see together, if only because the kids will definitely love it, but I think the adults will enjoy it too. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Catch That Kid"- 8/10. Good movie for the family to enjoy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catch That Kid (2004)When this film was released I knew it would get criticism, either by the premise of stealing money, or by it's similarities between Spy Kids and Agent Cody Banks. I do not agree that it is like Spy Kids, "Catch That Kid" is a lot better.The movie is about Maddy Phillips (Kristen Stewart- The Panic Room, Cold Creek Manor), who loves to climb. After an accident on Mt. Everest, her Dad becomes paralyzed, and he can get an operation in Denmark for $250,000- but insurance doesn't pay for it. So, Maddy recruits her two best friends, Austin and Gus, to help her rob a high security bank whose security system her mother created. The safe is suspended 100 feet high, and Maddy must overcome her fear of climbing too high, so that she can save her father's life.This movie had some really neat climbing sequences, good action, but it lacked a few laughs. Bart Fruendlich manages the security and heist scenes well, and the film has some pretty odd security devices for the bank.Kristen Stewart is great, she gives a good performance, and her two best friends are also good. The parents are a bit one dimensional, but it doesn't really matter to the kids, which is the audience most likely to be attracted to this movie. When seeing this with your kids, just let them know robbing a bank isn't a good thing, and that it's just a movie. Don't let them take it too seriously, but hey, they're kids. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Teen heist come fantasy/adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A U.S. remake of the Danish film Klatretosen (2002), Catch that Kid is a teen heist film, in a nutshell. When Maddy's (Kristen Stewart) dad needs an expensive operation, she plans a heist to get the money to pay for it, enlisting the help of her two equally inventive friends, Austin (Corbin Bleu) and Gus (Max Thieriot). Catch that Kid is a lot of fun, but viewers who are only looking for "realistic" fare may be disappointed. As a teen heist film, Catch that Kid is heavy on the fantasy aspects, which are frequently more cartoonish than realistic. Whether you'll like it will largely depend on whether you don't mind, or even prefer (as I do), fantasy instead of reality in films. And unlike traditional heist films, Catch that Kid has an overarching "warm and fuzzy" message, with a predictable climax and denouement. Even though it is heavy on fantasy elements, the three stars, Stewart, Bleu and Thieriot, are very believable, in context, in their roles. The film is interesting that in spite of being a heist film, it is also constructed like a more traditional fantasy/adventure story. In this interpretation, the bank is as a castle, presided over by an evil ruler. Our heroes must enter the castle stealthily, foiling the court jesters/castle guards, evading the magical beasts to scale the inner sanctum, retrieve the sacred token, escape on horseback and save the true King. That the plot can work in both the modern heist setting and the traditional fantasy/adventure setting gives in more depth and more unconscious resonance with audiences amenable to less realistic tales. Comparisons can easily be made to other recent films such as the Spy Kids series, the Cody Banks series, or even animated fare such as Kim Possible, but each has its particular niche, and Catch that Kid was just as entertaining to me (a middle-aged male) as any heist film for grown-ups. Finally, in a different tone, let me repeat the rant I gave in my review of The Grudge (2004): It is ridiculous that U.S. distributors and studios feel that we need remakes of foreign films to make them appropriate for consumption. The original versions of these films should just be playing in U.S. theaters in wide release. There is no need to present an almost identical film but just substituting white American actors for non-white or foreign actors. Yes, Catch that Kid is a fine film, but ultimately, I'd rather see something original using this talent, and be treated to the latest foreign films--not just European, but Asian, African, etc.--at my multiplex. In the hope that someone with some pull at the studios reads this, it is also more cost-effective to do this, as (1) you can completely avoid production costs, and simply make domestic distribution deals from which you receive profit, and (2) you can make money off of fans like myself who otherwise pick up the foreign film DVDs in foreign manufactured or even bootleg versions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As long as you don't apply any real caper rules to this then it's fun.The idea of kids robbing a bank and using their ingenuity to do it has to be immensely appealing to young teenagers, and the results on that basis are fine.The back story - robbing the bank to pay for the father's surgery - is well handled, and overall it is a positive movie for girls - Kristen Stewart, who plays Maddy is definitely the leader and for this alone it makes it a better than normal teen movie.Your kids can watch this without being corrupted; it's just a fun heist / caper movie that will keep the whole family entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weaned On Heist Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm noting that Catch That Kid was based on a popular Danish film, Klatretosen that only came out a few years ago. There had to be another motivation for what these three enterprising juveniles did because Denmark unlike the USA has socialized medicine and the problem that the kids need the money for wouldn't exist there.What that problem is that Kristen Stewart's dad John Carroll Lynch has aggravated an old spinal injury that has left him bedridden and paralyzed. The only hope of a treatment is an experimental procedure that our insurance won't pay and will cost $250,000.00 for the operation. So Kristen enlists her two friends, Max Thierot and Corbin Bleu to do a bank robbery.Getting inside information is easy because Kristen's mom, Jennifer Beals runs a security company and on a take your daughter to work day she accompanies mom and pays very close attention to the procedures installed in the bank that Beal's is contracted to work for. Although they don't say so, it's pretty obvious these kids were weaned on heist films like To Catch A Thief and The Asphalt Jungle. Cary Grant never pulled off a neater robbery than this trio. Catch That Kid is a nice enough film that might send a wrong message out there to younger viewers. Truth be told these kids are almost caught, but get some help from an unexpected source. They never should have gotten as far as they did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New low in irresponsible film making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even most adult heist films show that there are consequences for lying, stealing, and endangering the lives of others. But when 12-year-old Maddy engages in all these thing and more in order to rob a bank (for which her mom designed the security system), the slow-witted adults around her are admiring and awed by her nobility. The entire plot premise - Maddy's family can't afford an expensive operation for her dad - is cheap enough to be insulting. Your kids need to see this movie if you want them to learn that: *All authority is bad (not to mention idiotic). *Cops are evil - don't trust them. *It's okay to lie to your parents. *It's okay to lie to your friends. *You're never to young to use sex as a tool to get what you want. *Putting the toddlers you babysit in deadly danger is funny. *All of these are admirable if you come up with the cash. On the positive side, this movie is very entertaining on an 8-year-old level, and I'm sure most children will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Those playful young scamps.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An American remake of Danish 2002 film Klatret?sen, Catch That Kid is undemanding family fare for the, well, undemanding. Plot sees Kristen Stewart as Maddy, whose father is rendered paralysed from an old mountaineering accident. Unable to raise the $250,000 needed for the potential life changing operation, Maddy and her mother are at a dead end. But Maddy hits upon the idea of robbing the bank where her mother has been the security consultant, so enlisting the help of her two young pals, she sets about committing the perfect robbery.Plot suggests it is what it is, kiddie friendly fodder that's as preposterous as it gets. But it's still a likable enough tale, stitched together competently enough by director Bart Freundlich, and the actual robbery itself is well crafted and not without genuine tension. The child actors, led by future Twilight star Stewart, don't annoy, and the writers even plant the strains of puppy love on the edges of the narrative. It's all heading to an obvious conclusion, one that is very It's A Wonderful Life in intent, but it does it's job well enough and closes off with a smugness that's hard to get mad at.An easy enough time filler to watch with the kids or to do your ironing too. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In fact, I like the original version "Klatret?sen (2002)" better. I first saw the story played on the screen which was "Klatret?sen (2002)" on TV couple years ago. And I saw the USA version last year on TV. To tell the truth, I don't think the USA version is better than the original "Klatret?sen." Some ideas of the movie or mode of stealing method were changed, maybe more technological and electronic on the equipments....the kids' gears and outfits were more fancy....IDK....but there are just something that can't reason me down. I recommend whoever are or aren't Kristen Stewart fans (actually I delight in Kristen Stewart's performance) to see the original version "Klatret?sen (2002)" if u can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is gonna take some explaining, but here we go: There's a girl right? She is training herself to be just as good a climber as her dad, an ex-mountaineer. Her two best friends are, in short: a computer geek and an adrenaline junkie. Her mother has just finished installing a security system at a bank, but it isn't properly tested yet. Despite all this, the arrogant manager of the branch decides to go ahead with a party he had planned. Meanwhile, The girl's dad collapses one night due to the effects of an injury he acquired while on the peaks. The diagnosis isn't good: He will be paralysed for life unless his family can raise 250'000 dollars for a trip to Copenhagen and a mobility restoring operation. Seeing as their attempts at borrowing the cash lead to nought, the kids decide to plan a little heist on mummy's bank the night of the manager's big do. With the young lady's climbing ability, the nerd's technical know-how and the adrenaline guy's habit of getting out of a tight spot, they make a perfect team! In fact, so perfect it could only be dreamed up in a movie screenplay! But forget my cynicism, let's check in on them as they start their raid!And what a bank this is! All you need to sneak in is dress in formal dinner wear, even if you look only 14 years old! Plus to protect.. oh what was it now.. 18 million bullion?.. the institution hires.. you guessed it. Two of the most retarded guards you'll ever likely to meet, one just fresh out of college with no experience and the other a complete psychopath who is in serious need of a dose of Ritalin. Ah, but that's not all! They also have to deal with.. two rottweilers! Scary stuff! Apart from that, there's also the motion detector cameras, the hidden laser that sets off the alarm, the huge drop while our wannabe climber girl is scaling up to the vault.. and yet they pass these tests with ease! if only robbing Lloyd's TSB was this easy! I'd do it myself! I'll tell you what would have made it more interesting.. if the children had run into a gang of REAL policemen while executing their plan other than those two boobs. Would they have accidentally zapped themselves with tazers in the corridor or staged fake sword fights when they're supposed to watching their monitors? No, they probably would have opened fire there and then on what could be for all they know an armed gang. I know, I know, I'm being over the top, but this seriously is one of the most ridiculous scenarios I've ever seen.Oh wait! I haven't even mentioned the getaway on go-carts. Somehow the brats evade two (Yes TWO) panda cars AND a chopper on almost deserted streets, all while low on fuel and ducking under trucks all the way. This is an amazing accomplishment for the young actors, and anyone who accuses the director of having short stuntmen under those helmets is quite patently wrong. Then, when they get to the hospital to take daddy to Denmark, he wants to know where his little precious got all the moolah. Not to worry, Mommy is quickly on the scene with an explanation that will save her daughter from having to break rocks for the next four years. Only problem is, its not a very good one. Only an idiot would believe it. Fortunately though, that sums up 100% of the adults in this film.. they buy it hook, line and sinker. So everything works out fine: Father's gets his operation, Mother saves her job and the Tomboy still gets hang around with her two best mates on the racetrack. The only question remaining is.. which of them does she.. you know.. like LIKE?! Stay tuned to the gripping conclusion to find out. Or maybe not.. 3/10 P.S Oops I got so worked up over the unbelievable plot I forgot to tell what I actually thought of it. Yeah, it sucked like an over zealous vacuum cleaner. And anyone else want to kill that stupid baby? Talk about overdoing the cute! Anyway, tune in next time my wonderful viewers!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadly... not impressed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been wanting to watch this film forever. I saw the Danish original "Klatret?sen" when I was 10 years old and still like it very much. However, this remake left me quite disappointed. I've watched a couple of American remakes of Danish films - "Catch that Kid", "The First Time/Love at First Hiccup", the latter being one of my favorite (Danish) films ever.However, the American remakes tend to turn way too cliché for my taste. Lame humor, downright horrible line-delivery, the inability to stay true to the mood in the originals. It seems that lots of key elements are lost in translation. Wouldn't watch either this or "The First Time" again; I would however recommend viewers (and especially non-Danes) to check out the originals.</fullReview>

Her father Tom Phillips (Sam Robards) suffers a paralysis from an old climbing injury that requires $250k for treatment. Her mother Molly (Jennifer Beals) works at the bank but the bank president Donald Brisbane refuses to lend her the money. Maddy decides to rob the bank with the help of her young friends despite the fact that her mother is the security chief.The kids are all photogenic and they are good young actors. However there is nothing actually funny. It's too stupid to be real and too real to be fun. There isn't any joy in this kids movie. They even try a love triangle for them.

		<fullReview>This is a good movie of Kristen S. but i'll say this movie is OK or not the best. I used to watch this often, but not anymore. This is a good movie for younger people/kids. I'll appreciate this title. This is a good suggestion if kids or younger adult like crime/action movie that involves young people. ANYWAY, this is a OK movie, but you should watch it. It is not the best or the worst, this is just my opinion. Spoiler ALERT: By the way, this is a Disney movie about 3 friends who group up to rob money for Abby's (Not sure if it is the correct name) who Kristen S. is playing as, father. He have serious injuries or disease and the family need money to heal him. At the end, the cops catched the group of kids, so the kids collects money from where they work (race kart place or something).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only a fluff of a kids movie, it is fun to see Kristen Steward at 13, before she became famous.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kristen Stewart is Maddy and outdoors type that we used to call a "tomboy" when I was younger. In particular she enjoyed climbing outdoors with her dad. But things get rough for the family when dad is injured and they cannot afford the expensive surgery. So, she hatches a plan, to rob the bank that her mom is the security agent for.Sam Robards is her dad, Tom, and Jennifer Beals is her mom, Molly. She has a couple of neighbor kids, friends of hers, help.Most of the movie involves the elaborate and tricky breaking in to get the highly secure money in the vault. None of it is possible, of course, but it makes for a good kids movie.SPOILERS: They actually get money, $250,000 worth, and escape at night on go-carts. They make it to dad's hospital room with the cash, followed closely by mom and then the cops and the bank president. Mom has a bright idea, to protect the kids she claims they were under her direction (a lie!) to expose the security vulnerability. They then raise some money, not nearly enough, until the bank president comes forward with a $50,000 check, "consulting fees", which allowed dad to get his surgery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Catch that Kid" is a great Kids movie that deals with emotions that regular kids go through as adolescents. I actually watched the movie last night and found myself laughing at parts in the movie and I'm 15-years-old and I really enjoyed it. The movie is about a young girl named Maddy (Kristen Stewart) and her two best friends Gus and Austin and how they plot to steal money from a high-tec bank with a high-tec system of security developed by her mom. The trio plans to do this because they need to collect 250,000 dollars for Maddy's hurt father. The movie also deals with Gus competing with Austin over the love of Maddy...I thought it was weird how she ended up dealing with them two...But over all this movie is AWESOME!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[beware of spoilers]Catch That Kid is not without its good points. For children, it's fun, humorous, and full of adventure. If you watch it just on the surface, it can be quite entertaining.However, the film is very unbelievable. First of all, how is it possible that a bunch of kids can rob what's supposed to be a high-tech bank, even if the security systems aren't fully ready? Secondly, could a bank official really be so sloppy as to let a kid see him type the password? And thirdly, how could Maddy's father be perfectly fine one minute, then suddenly fall down paralyzed?The many unbelievable events pale in comparison to the unbelievable heroine, Maddy. She lies, manipulates, and steals to get what she wants. Even if her overall intentions are good, the ends do not justify the means. Kids who watch this movie may think it's okay to lie if you have to, which is simply not true.So in conclusion, the sheer idiocy makes it so this movie can only be enjoyed by little kids who don't know better and their half-asleep parents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catch That Kid is your typical kid's movie. It's above average for the genre, I suppose.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catch That Kid passed the time adequately for me. It's good natured, with a lot of good kid actors, at this point in time. The main attraction for me, was of course Kristen Stewart. She often carries this film, with her charisma, and likability. Corbin Bleu and Max Thieriot add great support with Kristin to make a likable trio, but the film is much too limited to fully work. The movie can only go as far as it's plot can take it. For a kid's movie, it's a lot better then most. The subplot with Max and Corbin fighting for Kristen's love, was a bit silly though, and took away some of the enjoyment of the film for me. I mean Her dad was in bad health, and all those two cared about was having her love? it seemed rather selfish to me. There is one decent action scene, where the boys race away from the cops on go carts. For a Kid's film, I have to say that was pretty impressive. The Main beef I had with this movie though, is that it's often very bland. Adults like me, won't find a lot appealing, and it will only do enough to just get you by with the movie.Performances. Kristen Stewart proves once more, why she deserves her status as one of Hollywood's top actresses now. The charisma she induces for her age, is absolutely remarkable. She carried this film, and made me believe in her. Corbin Bleu and Max Theriot provide likable support to Kristen. The Three made a good team, and made the film a lot better then it should have been. Jennifer Beals and Sam Robards made for likable parents. John Carroll Lynch is the comic relief, he had some amusing scenes.Bottom Line. Catch That Kid is better then it has any right to be. It falls flat overall, when all is said and done. There is still a fair amount of enjoyment to be had, Kids will love it, and adults won't be as tortured as they thought they would be.5 1/2 10</fullReview>

The film is about 3 Kids, Maddy,Gus and Austin and they have to steal a bank to pay for there dad's leg injury. This film is fast-paced and you really wonder whats going to be around the corner. At times you are on the edge of your seat! Brilliant! Corbin Bleu ( off High School Musical) stars and he really acts well even though he was only young then. I thought because this film was only a pg that it wasn't going to be action-packed and intense, but i was completely wrong, it contains lots of action violence and rude humour! Overall 9/10 for one of the best spy-family movies since Agent Cody Banks! I Hope This Helped!</fullReview>

Even though it went to robbing a bank the movie still showed how important family and friends are to have.

		<shortDescription>Funny and Exciting, but Negative Moral Themes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, at the start, was interesting enough. It's very funny, to say the least - the humor was in the same mold as Home Alone. It was filled with excitement, thrilling chases, and tense moments.The film's premise about the kids robbing the bank to save Maddy's dad was, to say the least, disappointing. It had it's upsides, but the filmmakers seemed to forget the fact that this movie is all about something illegal and wrong, robbing a bank, and add to that the fact that Maddy lies to her friends to convince them to help her.Throughout the entire film I was waiting for a redeeming quality; for them to get punished somehow, such as always happened in Shakespeare's plays. In his plays, such as Macbeth, Macbeth kills the king and ends up dying later on as a consequence for murder. There were several times in the film where it made you think they would get caught, but they got away with it and, at the end, just got a slap on the hand. Overall, the film was funny and exciting, but the moral themes just weren't right. It's movies like this that make you appreciate Shakespeare so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this just to see how stupid it really was. It was very bad. The two things that made me laugh were the part about Austin putting nitrous oxide into the go-carts. Those go-carts would be blown up if the used any of it while driving. Also the part about the contents of the safe. The safe was supposed to contain a lot of money in gold bullion which isn't cash. When Maddy gets to the safe it was full of cash not gold. If you are thinking of getting it, don't. It was pretty much a waste of time. One other part that was really weird is that in any high security area all the codes would be different instead of the sane code for all the doors. One last thing was even when the mom said that the kids were part of a test they would still be responsible for dumping the tacks or whatever they were on the ground. One more thing was the kids never have gotten away from the dogs and they wouldn't have cornered them they would have attacked because they are attack dogs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Minor Spoilers Ahead-'Catch That Kid' is not a bad film for a younger (pre-13) audience. The three kids are all pleasant and competent-Kristen Stewart (a younger and shorter Portman/Knightley type), Corbin Bleu, and Max Thieriot are all talented kids. However beware-the screenplay is VERY weak in the credibility department. But if you can accept the idea of three kids robbing a super-secure bank vault then you can probably overlook the obvious plot flaw-how they will explain where they got the $250,000 for her father's operation. The problem is that the kids are played as far too intelligent to overlook such an obvious issue. Then you get into the moral/ethical dilemma of stealing-the scriptwriters try (unconvincingly) to solve this by having Stewart's character say that she will pay it all back. Bottom line-be prepared to buy into a moronically contrived story (at least 'The Perfect Score' had a solid story foundation).Director Bart Freundlich and Director of Photography Julio Macat should take a look at some 'Saddle Club' episodes before they make another film targeted toward this age group. Hey guys-it is all about kids in the audience bonding with the kids in the production. 'Saddle Club' does that with mega close-ups and extreme close-ups. Almost every shot in 'Catch That Kid' should have been tighter (wide shots should have been close-ups, close-ups should have been extreme close-ups, etc. etc.). Watch the DVD with the zoom switch activated and you will see how it should have been shot. Also turn on the actors' commentary which is quite unaffected and really adds to the charm of the film.Finally be sure to watch the 'Gone Nutty' short on the DVD-great animation!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is great for the whole family! It contains a few rude jokes, but they are altogether funny, and don't have anything that parents would cringe to hear. So what if some of the facts of this movie aren't real, it's all fictional! It is technically impossible for three 12 year olds to rob a bank, let alone get past a high-tech security system, but it is all in fun! The first time I saw this movie, I didn't want to miss a thing. If you like movies, with a bit of spy business, police chases, and bank robberies, and you're a kid at heart (I sure am still!), you'll just love this movie! I don't want to give away any spoilers, so you'll have to see for yourself how good this movie is!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The above line, which is actually spoken in "Catch That Kid", should be enough for you to decide whether this is your type of film or (hopefully) not, but let me just add a few more details. They say that when a music score calls attention to itself it's either very good or very bad. The score of "Catch That Kid" falls into the latter category: it's an insultingly over empathetic piece of work that is constantly telling you what you're supposed to be feeling (awe, danger, joy, mysticism). Apart from that, the story is dull, since you always know that everything will turn out all right in the end, and the baby is way too cute - its "assistance" in the climax is a real groaner. All this film has going for it are some dangerous and well-performed physical stunts. Where to begin. This is a horrible family film, very unrealistic. The original was an excellent Danish family movie, it had values. "Oh, it's OK to steal if it's for the right reasons, mommy!". Believe me, there are much better family films out there. But they were made in the '90s, when film-makers actually spent good money on talent and excellent scripting with values. I agree, people who make kid's movie have now realized kids will watch anything, no matter how low quality and terrible it is and what untalented actors star in it. Once again the entertainment industry has totally botched an opportunity to make a wonderful and heart-warming film about a beloved and extremely popular Danish movie. I should have known better. It was wishful thinking on my part that just this once, they would get it right. I only hope that this movie does not deter viewers from watching the wonderful Danish movie, which actually had some morals. If you have seen this movie, I am very sorry. I sat through this terrible film one afternoon and wound up actually kicking myself for it. The acting is bad, but what do you expect from a young girl and 2 young boys. The script was just awful, and there was absolutely no excitement or value whatsoever to this film. The events are both predictable, and highly unlikely. The worst part about it is there aren't even any laughable aspects as in other terrible movies such as Troll 2 or Future War. If you haven't seen this movie, don't go out of your way to see it. Actually, do everything you can to avoid seeing it. What a waste of 5 hours...what's that? the movie was only an hour and a half?! Huh??? This movie drags and drags, and has well, about 0 good qualities. I was literally kicking myself for having wasted my time to view this atrocious mess of the cinema. The plot is lame and very forced, the acting is bad at best, and the story is quite predictable. I understand that this was no attempt to make another Citizen Kane or anything, but oh man, this is seriously painful to watch! If you are looking for good "family" entertainment there are tons of other options. However, if you are looking to torture yourself and/or others, then check this movie out...it's something that you'll never forget, though more than likely you'll wish you could. Kristen Stewart gives an awful, horrible, terrible performance. Her delivery of lines were terrible and she was extremely over the top. While I do appreciate her talents in other films like Speak and Panic Room, she's just awful here but I guess I can't blame her since it's the dumb ass director's fault, he gets her to totally overact in every scene. As I am sure everyone knows Ms. Tylor is like a big kid sometimes and really enjoys watching the wholesome family films like Alaska, Fly Away Home etc. So very needless to say I was looking forward to Kristen Stewart's new movie Catch That Kid. So on Friday afternoon, opening day I went to see Catch That Kid. The movie is about an adventurous 12-year-old girl named Maddy Phillips (Kristen Stewart), who is an excellent mountain climber. Unfortunately, her father, Tom (Sam Robards), was severely injured on Mount Everest and requires costly surgery to repair his spine. With the help of her friends (Max Thieriot and Corbin Bleu) and her climbing skills, Maddy develops a plan to rob a bank in order to finance her father's medical bills. Also starring Jennifer Beals as Maddy's mother, Molly, who happens to be the security chief at the bank. . Well a confusing bad scripted film ensues but luckily Kristen Stewart, who's pretty bad uses her charm to manage to save the film from totally sucking.The two main characters in the film were decent. The highlight character of course is Kristen Stewart's character Madeline. You can kinda enjoy the character. Also Max Thieriot's character Gus is also decent but then when you get into the supporting cast that is where is gets bad. I mean Corbin Bleu's performance, as Austin was so poor, it seemed as though he just fell out of acting class. John Carroll Lynch who played Mr. Hartman was nothing short of annoying in the film. So the casting was so/so.Michael Grant who wrote the awful movie 2 Fast 2 Furious wrote this movie. Yes I said that right 2 Fast 2 Furious. Maybe that's why the script sucked so badly. I was expecting a totally different movie from what the trailer led me to believe. I thought I was watching a movie about a girl who loved climbing things and her dad gets an operation is how the film did start out but then got really involved with this stupid I have to go to get this money *evil gleam in eyes* which then basically became the entire film. The movie then ended with the climbing thing that seemed to be the point of the film when it first started. The problem here to me was they tried to take two ideas and mesh them together and it failed. I would have rather seen the movie about a girl who wanted to get an operation with actual values over a film about 1 girl and 2 boys who wanted to steal the money for their dad's expensive operation. It's just not interesting enough. But if you do hold through until the end it tries to make things better but by that time your already disappointed with the film.The director, Bart Freundlich, didn't do much to help the film out. He directed four films before this, which I never heard of. I have to blame the director for this film because he read the script and he should have made changes. I enjoyed how the film started. I liked his view of the racing track and I liked how he imaged Maddy to be. I liked that but when it came to become a film about robbing a bank because that's where she should have said wait cut isn't this about a girl who is dreaming of becoming a climbing with real family values but no she let it go and that's why it turned out the way it did. Also the whole ending of the film felt rushed. They rushed in all four songs and a whole play at the end in less than 5 minutes.I may be sounding kind of mean but the film wasn't all that bad in the end. It had that wholesome touch and was OK at some points. Sadly in the end this movie was disappointing to me. I wanted to give the film a 6/10 but I can't give it that anymore. I have to give it a 3/10 or maybe a 4/10 just because of the great soundtrack. I was overall disappointed though with the film. I really wanted to enjoy myself here but instead I was let down. I only hope that Kristen Stewart's new film Speak is better than this one. I think it will because it's at Sundance. So I eagerly await its release. Kristen proves though that she has enough talent to pull her way through even poorly written films. This movie truly makes me sick. With cheesy teenybopper lines coming out of the mouths NOT teenyboppers. "Oh, it's OK to steal for the right reasons!". What the hell kind of moral is THAT?? Kids should not watch this garbage.</fullReview>

Stop underestimating their level of intelligence. The scenes seem formulaic to the point of exhaustion. The beginning seems rushed. The bank manager was one dimensional (c'mon, who's THAT mean?) as were the security guards (who's that STUPID?).

		<fullReview>The unplausible plot and the stretch of material makes this kiddy movie difficult to even define. Definitely not in the same league as any Spy Kid though the trailer is suggestive of some hi-tech gimmicks. Overall this movie is a big let down for misleading advertising leading one to expect one type of movie only to lose itself in another kind of movie. The somewhat decent ending can't save this slow, overly thin movie that includes even a dumb security guard that's even dumber than the one in Mannequin. From go-carts, to saving father, to bank robberies, to the unlikely set of three kids without super abilities makes for a lame movie that plods along, stitched together by a script that holds together only through one scene to another scene. Not recommended. Four out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Catch That Kid is a great movie, and everyone who says it is a rip off are wrong. I could honestly say this is one of my favorite movies ever. I was drawn to it because of the rock climbing part of it, being a climber myself, and there are some scenes like that have wonderful climbing elements portrayed, like when Maddy is hanging of the safe suspended 100 feet in the air. But the movie is not about climbing, but about three friends, (Maddy, Gus, and Austin)who form a plan to rob a high security bank in order to save Maddy's dying father. This is an excellent movie and I definitely recommend seeing it. It is also quite funny, an example is how the two boys both have a crush on Maddy and often fight over her. Also the wannabe actor that the kids secretly use in their heist without him knowing it. Overall an excellent movie.</fullReview>

The Police chasing the go carts were really done well.The thing about this film is the storyline. It was poor.In Summary a girls fathers old climbing injury acts up making him unable to walk. a experimental surgery is is only hope. Problem it costs $250,000 dollars. His daughter Maddy(Miss Steward) and her two best friends, two boys, plan to rob the bank her mom is doing the security computer for, for the money.They should have come up with a better reason for the robbery than above and a different thing they are going after.It seems of late the Movie/TV industry does not recornize a poor story when they see read it.Miss Stewards playing Maddy is stiff. She should have played it more relaxed. showed more emotion. Granted maybe the producers/Directors wanted it played that way. If so it will not help them get jobs.In one point the guys get mad at her because she tells them after they ask that she just wants to be friends not either of there's girlfriend. Unknown to the other she tells them she loves them to get them to continue to help her with the robbery. This should have not been in the movie at all. A poor sub plot. This sub plot was badly done. The thing that makes this a C movie is the storyline. Better story it would have been a good movie.Good premise badly done.Just wait till it comes on a movie channel like HBO or on network TV to see it. It really is not worth paying money to see just this movie.I think this could be a cult classic because of the storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Catch That Kid is an adorable film about three kids (Maddy, Gus, and Austin) who go on a mission to rob a bank in order to save Maddy's ailing father. The actors are great, and there is a kid everyone can relate to...Maddy is a rock climber, Gus a mechanic, and Austin a computer whiz...and each has their own unique style and personality. It's a fun, comedic, action-packed film for kids and a great movie for family viewing. If you're a parent or a babysitter, this film is perfectly appropriate for kids of all ages and there's something in it for everyone (I'm 17 and I loved it). So, next time you're looking for a great family flick or something to take babysitting, or even if your a teenager like me and you're bored...Catch that Kid is fun for everyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a dumbed down Spy Kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catch That Kid: a Dumbed Down Spy Kids Yeah, this is a kid's show; so how seriously should I take it? I suppose I should relax a little on my critique-ness but I still had to sit through the thing. I figure the studios have finally realized that kids will watch anything no matter how bad it is- Lilo &amp; Stitch proved that. So rather than spend a lot of money on original scripts and good talent, they release things like this. After watching the preview for 5 seconds the first thing that comes to mind is, 'gee, Spy Kids rip-off maybe?'. As you leave the theatre after this film the first thing that comes to mind is, 'even Spy Kids 3-D wasn't that bad'. But here it is nonetheless; and will do pretty well at the box office like all kids movies do, no matter what quality they are. The movie has a mix of Spy Kids like action, with Power Rangers type characters. Here is the plot: Maddy, played by Kristen Stewart (Panic Room, Cold Creek Manor) is a young girl who has a joy of climbing things. Her father is an ex-climber who made it up Mt. Everest but sustained a near death accident as he fell over 100 feet on his decent. Maddy has two friends, Austin- the computer expert, and Gus- the racer/mechanic expert. One day Maddy's father collapses under some trauma sustained from his climbing injury. Faced with probable paralysis with the only cure being an alternative surgery performed only in Europe to the chime of $250,000, Maddy begins to plot. Her mother works as a security expert who is installing high-tech security system at a large bank. So Maddy and her two friends get the brilliant idea to rob the bank her mom works at and thus save her dad. What then follows is a very weak set up with farcical characters that seemed grossly out of place. Whereas the kids are in a semi serious mode, several of the supporting characters seem like something out of a Laurel &amp; Hardy sketch. The over the top antics of a megalomaniac banker and the Mutt and Jeff stupidity of a pair of security guards take the film in a different and unpleasant direction. Too many of the films weak plot points seemed extremely random and served no apparent purpose. In order to infiltrate the office building the kids need to get through a formal office party taking place on the first floor. Maddy declares they need 'to blend in'. The next shot is a slow motion pan up, a la The Right Stuff, of the three twelve-year olds in formal wear. Like that's going to blend in with the party of 30-60 year old. Much of the movie is in that vein; the suspension of disbelief is suspended too long and finally just snaps and falls. If you have some kids you need to keep quiet for an hour and half that's fine. But if you expect any real entertainment value out of this, save your time and money. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maddy (Kristen Stewart) is a 12-year old girl who loves to climb. Her father has climbed Mount Everest, so it runs in the family. Several years earlier Maddy's father fell more than 100 feet during a climb, and because her parents are afraid she might hurt herself, they have ordered Maddy not to climb. Maddy's father had some internal injuries from that earlier fall, which he didn't know, and now the injury has paralyzed him from the neck down. There is an experimental operation, costing $250,000, which can save Maddy's father. Insurance won't pay for the operation, and the family doesn't have the money. Maddy and two friends break into a high-tech bank vault, designed by Maddy's mother, to get the money. The vault is suspended 100 feet above the ground, and Maddy must use her climbing skills to get to the safe. Her friends use their computer and mechanical skills to defeat the bank's high-tech security. This is a kid's version of Mission Impossible. Kids will like the movie, but adults will just have to endure it with their children. (20th Century Fox, Run Time 1:32, Rated PG) (4/10)</fullReview>

The last half of the movie is the heist which is really entertaining &amp; a lot of fun is well done &amp; really cool. Anyone under the age of 14 won't care that the whole thing about the dad dying is unbelieveable. They'll just enjoy it for the heist. The kids will want to see this on the big screen.

Plus, this movie showed excellent storyline and some key morals. Sure there were a couple of plot holes. But there was humor to make up for that flaw. I think anyone who calls this film a spy-kids wanna-be is just looking for an excuse to criticize this film. Critics only look for flaws in movies. And people who see movies based on critical reviews should see the film for themselves before making a decision on how good a movie is.

Even though i like it in some movies, not really in this one,again that is my opinion and i don't mean to offend anyone or anything but i just like action. I like romance in other movies though, just not really for this...... But in the end they all did a very well job and i think this movie should be rated at least a 9 because they really showed hard work and determination and everything that goes along with making a movie.....-shalaila :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slight but entertaining action films for the kids about a bunch of young teens that pull of a bank robbery. Has enough action and thrills, while hitting all the basics of the heist film. The kid angle actually works to a point.. The kids will love it, the adults will at least not be bored. GRADE: C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would Never Happen, but Still AWESOME!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All of the actors and actresses were absolutely amazing! All of the teen actors produced adult quality, even Max Thieriot, even though this was his first movie! I love how they balanced out all of the different types of movies this was, to make it all just roll together. I have watched this movie numerous times, and yet I still absolutely adore it! The emotional scenes are just fantastic, and when i saw this in theaters I was just amazed at how good all of the acting was done. It has some parts that could really happen, and some that would never happen, but that is normally just what movies are usually lacking. I would most definitely recommend this movie to practically anybody, and I am almost absolutely sure that they would love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel the movie got a pretty low rating on this site because most of the people on IMDb are older and take movie pretty seriously. They rated it according to its cinematic. I find this movie to be very amusing than most kid movie.Brief: Unless she could come up with the money her father is slipping away into being paralyzed from neck downward permanently. Desperate, Maddy and two other friends set up a heist to rob the bank with the best security system.I think the story is pretty smart and tight though it might start out very slow. The script has been written pretty well for this genre of movie. All the three children characters are balancing in the film very well. And I really like how each character contribute to the movie equally. And the sub-plot is also very neat and is the thing I enjoy the most, love triangle between them; really is amusing.The casting is brilliant, Kristen is giving a good performance compare to girls her age, Max is good looking and Corbin is talented and believable. Just because it is a kid flick I feel people are pigeonhole the movie, I in the other hand find it to be much better than Ocean 11, Spy Kids nor Agent Cody Banks.Lastly: the acting, score, directing isn't bad at all. I enjoy the movie almost every part of it; it is fun. I didn't feel rip-off, the story though make believe it was good and solid. And it is very much a re-watchable film. Entertaining enough to make me forget how many flaws it has.Reason To Watch: Love Triangle Was Amusing, The Movie is Very Entertaining.Reason Not To: If You Do Not Like Kids Movie, Don't Watch It And Complain About It Later.Recommendation: Yes, Rent It Today!! Rating: 7/10 (Grade: B-).Please Rate Y/N After Read, Thanks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Catch That Kid' is 'Ocean's Eleven' for the pre-pubescent set. It is also the second film this year to feature a group of youngsters masterminding a complex heist. In the first, 'The Perfect Score,' the prized goal was the answer sheet to the SAT test. In 'Catch That Kid,' the target is $250,000 ensconced in the spanking new vault of a bank where a young girl's mother works as head of security. The girl, Maddy, has come up with the plan as a means of raising funds for her crippled father who needs an expensive operation in Denmark if he hopes ever to walk again. Laudable as that goal may be, the premise is still an odd and dubious one for a film aimed at pre- and early-teen audiences. What a comfort it is to learn that kids can make just as effective bank robbers as adults.Actually, 'Catch That Kid' might have been more offensive were it not so poorly and ineptly made. As it is, it's so utterly innocuous that it barely registers a blip on our consciousness while we're watching it. The movie provides virtually no imagination, no humor and no excitement even for its target audience who will find it rather slow-paced and chintzy compared with the kinds of high tech, high-powered action films they are more accustomed to watching. Anyone old enough to watch this film is old enough to watch a real heist film like 'Rafifi' or 'Topkapi.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought Catch That Kid was awesome! Much better than Spy Kids anyway. I do believe people under the age of 40 would like it better than others because I was one of the youngest ones in the theater and the only one laughing besides my eleven year old little brother. Now that's really saying something. But besides that, it's a really good movie and I may be wrong and everyone may enjoy it! Take the whole family to see it! It's a really great movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Remake of "Klatretosen"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original movie "Klatretosen" yet but after seeing "Catch That Kid", now I am curious as to what the original is like.I had seen Kristen Stewart playing Jodi Foster's daughter in "Panic Room" and enjoyed her work, so I wanted to check her out in this movie and was rather impressed."Catch That Kid" was a great movie I took my two nephews to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a disappointment. I believe it should not be credited at all. It is a simpler version of Oceans 11, which by the way is an awesome movie. The plot line was simple, it could have been harder for them to get into the bank or something serious could have gone wrong where it was hard for them to adapt. It was very sad to watch and not "boo hoo" sad, just plain sad. The dumbest part of it was the part when she tricks the guys into helping her. That was stupid and didn't need to be there. They could have gotten rid of that part and added more technical parts in the bank scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kid heist movie can't catch audience's attention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catch That Kid (2004) Kristen Stewart, Corbin Bleu, Max Thieriot, Jennifer Beals, Sam Robards, John Carroll Lynch, James Le Gros, Michael Des Barres, D: Bart Freundlich. Dull, dispiriting high-tech kid caper about a 12-year-old girl who enlists her two best guy pals, the one a go-kart mechanic and the other a computer geek, to help her steal money from her mom's high-security bank to pay for her father's medical operation. Young target audience will get caught up in the unlikely premise's action (especially a go-kart chase by the police) and get a kick out of all the silly gas-related, crotch-related jokes taken up by two knucklehead security guards; adults may find this an opportunity to catch a nap. Remake of a 2002 Danish film, KLATRETOSEN. Running Time: 92 minutes and rated PG for some language, thematic elements, and rude humor. **</fullReview>
