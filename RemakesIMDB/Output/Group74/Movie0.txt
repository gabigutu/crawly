		<shortDescription>Absolutely the best action movie for children !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the absolutely perfect way to explain what a good movie is. It is a movie both for children and parents, and it is "timeless". I saw this movie before Ocean's Eleven and must admit that the actors in OE has class in advance, but the play of Klatret?sen is much more down-to-earth and moving. Why i say Ocean's Eleven, is the fact that these 2 movies has many things in common and Klatret?sen is THAT good ! that it can bear comparison with OE. The 3 youngsters play their part in a perfect way not to believe, compared to what we are used to in Denmark. The different cases of impossible acts, is handled in a way that you wouldn't belive from many young actors (and sometimes not even from the "old boys"). The story ? again it has things in common with Ocean's Eleven except for the reason of stealing the money and in Klatret?sen they need to climb up to the strongroom. The part in which the young people has to take care of Ida's younger brother, gives a fine element in the movie. Try to imagine how to rob a bank with a 2 year child with a nappy, on your arm :-).This movie can bear comparison with most "grown up" movie like MI2 and Ocean's Eleven. Yes i do believe it is THAT good. It is best to see it in a theater, as all the children in the room comments the movie and these comments will stay in your hearts forever :-).Regards Klavs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mission Possible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie at the Berlin Film Festival's Children's Program and it just killed me (and pretty much everyone else in the audience)! And make no mistake about it, this film belongs into the all-time-250! Let me tell you that I'm in no way associated with the creators of this film if that's what you come to believe reading this. No, but this actually is IT! Nevermind the "kid's-film" label on it, "Klatretösen" ("Climber Girl") is on almost every account a classic (as in "biblical")! The story concerns 12-year old Ida (magnetic: Julie Zangenberg), who is devastated to learn of her daddy's terminal illness. Special surgery in the US would cost 1.5 million and of course, nobody could afford that. So Ida and her friends Jonas and Sebastian do what every good kid would - and burglarize a bank! Sounds corny? Don't forget: This is not America and "Klatretösen" is by no means the tear-jerking Robin-Williams-multiplex-plat-du-jour nobody takes seriously anyway. Director Fabian Wullenweber set out to make a big-budget-action-comedy for kids and, boy, did he succeed! Let me put it this way: This film rocks like no kid-film and few others did before. And there's a whole lot more to it than just the "action". After about 20 minutes of by-the-numbers-exposition (well, granted) it accelerates into a monster that:- effortlessly puts "mission impossible" to shame (the numerous action sequences are masterfully staged and look real expensive - take that, mummy!)- dwarves almost every other movie suspense-wise ( no easy-they're-only-kids-antics here )- easily laces a dense story with enough laughs to make jim carrey look for career alternatives- nods to both damon runyon and karate kid within the same seconds- comes up with so much wicked humor that side of p.c. that I can hear the American ratings board wet their pants from over here- manages to actually be tender and serious and sexy at the same time (ohmygod, what am I saying?? they're kids! they're kids! - nevermind, watch that last scene!)- stars Stafan Pagels Anderson, who since last years "Mirakel" is everybody's favourite kid actorWhat a ride!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Youth movie since 'Fly Away Home'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I am sentimental, and yes, I love movies where kids are the better humans. True, Klatret?sen does have some logical or even plot shortcomings. These are more than compensated by the kids' great acting (Julias first movie role at all!) and the charm of a Dogma film (I liked this kind of cinematografic art long before the Dogma; ever since Herzog's 'Herz aus Glas'). Well, I cried through the last fifteen minutes which is a higher tear factor than bambi or Fly away home had for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kids commit bank burglar despair to save Father</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ida's Father has known to be a good climber, but in one event he fell down. A long period he has had no injuries of the fall, but suddenly he collapses and is hospitalized. He needs expensive surgery, but the Danish state does not pay for this kind of surgery. Ida, with her 2 pals Sebastian and Jonas sneak into a bank and try to steal money for the surgery. This is a heist film for children; although the 3 kids break into a bank, which is of course illegal, they act out of despair to prevent Ida's father from dying. The American remake "catch that kid" is not as good as this movie. Catch that kid is in my opinion a bad remake and my preference lies with this movie. This is original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe my expectations were too high...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankly, I was disappointed. The storyline was farfetched, the dialogue was entirely artificial, and the direction and camera work certainly did not live up to the trailer. Too centered around 'grown-up' themes for the kids, but aimed too much at teens to be a hit with the parents. The basic flaw, I think, is that 13-year-olds are too narrow a target audience. But it probably pleased the older part of Bubber's audience.</fullReview>
