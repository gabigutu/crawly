		<shortDescription>Way ahead of its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Way ahead of its time in both style and substance. The Front Page is a comic look at the underbelly of the newspaper business as well as a tough commentary on the times. In a press room outside the city jail, a group of newspaper reporters idly await the execution of a communist sympathizer accused of murder. Once the story heats up though, the press room becomes an absolute madhouse. The hilariously cynical script adapted from the play by Ben Hecht pulls no punches. Politics, the justice system, communist hysteria, love and marriage are all targets for the biting wit of the author. The script is complemented by a good ensemble cast. Pat O'Brien gives a good performance as Hildy Johnson, the star reporter for The Post, who is leaving his job for marriage. Adolphe Menjou steals the show, however, as Walter Burns, the conniving editor who will do anything to keep Johnson on the job. The rest of the news hounds are all expertly played, striking us as fun loving jokers one minute, but becoming downright violent the moment they smell a story. The movie also has a rare artistic style unequaled in most films. Though most of the movie takes place in the same location, the cinematography is done so well that we never feel we are watching a stage play. The cameras constantly move around the room, effectively putting us in the middle of the action. Pretty much everything about this film is done well. It is funny, edgy, artistic and thought provoking. Movies that can do all of that are few and far in between.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A+ A visionary masterpiece!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The camera-work on this underrated beauty is breathtaking - one of the panning shots in the newsroom precedes Woody Allen's restaurant pan shot in Hannah and Her Sisters by over half a century! It is so organic, yet so breezy and alive. Don't miss the clever panning action with the gun sequence, and the mirrored room with the man getting off the elevator, which is also a throw-away gem. The actors are some of the finest character and bit players ever assembled on screen and the lightning dialog and clever editing is really quite modern in its speed and ingenuity.I too am a devoted fan of His Girl Friday, but these are two very different films. Front Page is a masterpiece of old school ensemble character acting, and without it to break new ground, I don't believe His Girl Friday would have had nearly the breakneck pacing and out of the bottle genius that it is rightfully remembered for. The Front Page should take an esteemed place in film history for being the fertile breeding ground of screwball comedy in general and many of its masterpieces, including His Girl Friday, in particular. A must see for 1930's film buffs and screwball comedy fanatics!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior to Lemmon-Matthau version and "His Girl Friday"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This picture, of astronomical quality compared to other films of its era, represents, by and large, a photographic, if sanitized, record of the Hecht-MacArthur classic Broadway hit depicting yellow journalism, the "Red Anarchist Scare", and political corruption in 1928 Chicago. Being intimately familiar with the original stage production, this picture represents the play more faithfully than any subsequent remake (except for the rampant profanity in the original stage work); "His Girl Friday" being an inverted rework of the original, and the 1974 version merely a caricature of the original concept - with superfluous "madcap" elements added. Let's hope an intact negative can soon be found and restored - The viewing public and the memory of the artists and makers of this film deserve as much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Version of the Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If it weren't for the even better Howard Hawks remake, "The Front Page" would probably be much more well-remembered today. It's entertaining in its own right, with a slightly different feel from the remake, and it is better than most movies of its own era in at least a couple of important respects. While you can still tell at times that it is from the very early sound era, it does use sound and dialogue more smoothly and constructively (that is, rather than as a mere novelty) than do most early 30's movies.Adolphe Menjou has the role of Walter Burns, and he is a good fit, giving the character just a slightly different turn from the way that Cary Grant would later play it. The role of Hildy Johnson is somewhat bland in this one - it was the genius of Hawks in changing this role into a more worthy foil for Burns that made "His Girl Friday" so outstanding - but in compensation, some of the other reporters get more to do here. The supporting cast has a number of good character actors, especially Edward Everett Horton as the fussy Bensinger, and it's good that they were given some worthwhile moments of their own. Certainly the great remake deserves its own reputation, but this version deserves to be remembered as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Granddaddy of all newspaper films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Howard Hawks gave The Front Page a different twist by making Hildy Johnson a woman and giving her a romantic involvement with editor Walter Burns, The Front Page still holds up well today for its biting wit.All the clichés about newspapers as portrayed on film originate with this work. Lewis Milestone assembled a great cast of character actors as the gang in the press room and the lines they toss back and forth at each other are priceless. Even better were some of the lines at the expense of the self important political and law enforcement figures they cover.I suppose it's the nature of the job that makes newsmen cynical. But this group takes it to an exponential level. Frank Capra did something very similar in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. When newly appointed interim Senator James Stewart arrives in town and they make him out a buffoon, Stewart goes around punching out all of them he can find. When he does reach the Capitol Press Room, the whole group of them Thomas Mitchell, Jack Carson, Charles Lane, etc. bring him up quite short. That group of correspondents could easily have been in the press room in The Front Page. I have no doubt that Capra was inspired by Milestone's work in The Front Page.The casting of the leads is quite a story. Pat O'Brien had played Walter Burns on stage and someone in the Howard Hughes organization got their wires crossed and signed him for Hildy Johnson. O'Brien made the switch effortlessly though. Lewis Milestone originally wanted Louis Wolheim with whom he'd worked the year before in All Quiet on the Western Front. But then Wolheim died suddenly right before filming was to start. Adolphe Menjou was hurriedly substituted and he proved to be an inspired choice.When The Front Page was done on the Broadway stage the roles of Johnson and Burns were played by Lee Tracy and Osgood Perkins. I could see either of them in their respective parts. Both got to Hollywood, but too late to do either part for the screen.The two female roles of note were Johnson's fiancé Peggy and the streetwalker who had befriended convicted killer George E. Stone who's execution the reporters are covering. Mae Clarke as the prostitute is just fine. A tough year for Mae, she jumps through a window here and gets slugged with a grapefruit later on in Public Enemy.Mary Brian is the fiancé and in an underwritten part, she's dull as dishwater. Not her fault because the film is about the guys. But seeing this, no wonder Howard Hawks got the inspired idea to eliminate her, create THE Ralph Bellamy part and make Hildy Johnson a woman for His Girl Friday.Of course The Front Page has the look and feel of the era that birthed it. But the portrait of newspapermen is still fresh and the issues raised about crooked politicians running on "law and order" platforms is probably even more relevant today than back then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Newspaperman Hildy Johnson (Pat O'Brien) is quitting the business and getting married to Peggy (Mary Brian). But his unscrupulous boss Walter Burns(Adolphe Menjou) doesn't want him to quit. Also an innocent man is about to be hanged and Burns will do anything to make sure Johnson works on that story.Fast and funny--the first cinematic version of this story. It shows its age at times and some of it is wildly overacted but O'Brien and Menjou are both just great in their roles. Also director Lewis Milestone uses some very unusual camera tricks to keep the story moving and there's lots of action and running around which is unusual for an early talkie.This was remade in 1940 with a sex change making Johnson a woman. That was "His Girl Friday" with Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant. That one is better than this but this is better than the 1974 version (that had Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau) and 1988 remake called "Switching Channels" (with Kathleen Turner and Burt Reynolds). They're all good to varying degrees but this one came first. Worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Acting, Noble Motives but Who's the Girl?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the staging was limited, the acting was believable and the camera work was great for the technology available. After watching "Front Page" again after watching "Girl Friday", I was struck by the original's emphasis on the role of the newspaper in revealing political corruption. But, the question remains, who's the girl? Not the actress but the girl in the picture hanging on the wall in back of Adolph Menjou's head during the final scenes... Since the movie was released in 1931, it can't be Jane Russell. She's to busty to be Katherine Hepburn (Howard Hughes' friend). The only reason I noticed it was that she appears nude and Howard Hughes probably put it there to see if the 'censors' would notice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you see this movie first or My Girl Friday first, see one or the other or BOTH! This is what movies are all about! Great Acting. Great Action. Steady rhythm of dialog and a little romance doesn't hurt a bit. I especially enjoyed Frank McHugh (eh ha). These are some of the finest actors of the time. Adolph Menjou and Pat O'Brien were perfect partners in newspaper heaven. One of the early best sassy comedies with a bite to it. Be it that the visuals are not quality, the backbone makes you forget it was made in 1931. The beginning is unique with a newspaper flare! Sit back and enjoy this finely performed movie and it's earliest best!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore Camera Obscura's criticism!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remarks by Camera Obscura do an injustice to this film and reveal a true absence of aesthetics governing the writer's appreciation for camera technique, acting, directing and pace. While I am an enormous fan of the subsequent remake, "His Girl Friday," by Howard Hawks, Lewis Milestone's direction of the original is invigorating and sets a pace that Hawks had to match before he began to trump it with his own use of crackling overlapping dialog. Way ahead of its time, the camera explores the set, and Milestone and his editor know how to use editing to create pace. This is not merely a filmed play. It is faithful to the play and excellently exploits the camera's ability to go to closeups, long shots, etc. The acting, particularly by Adolphe Menjou, is as good as in any version. I am also distressed by the comments of Eye 3 who agrees with Obscura that the dialog is shouted in order to be picked up by the microphones! The actors are shouting because their characters are excited - the rapid fire dialog coupled with shouting is an element of farce and is beautifully done, and in the televised version I just watched on TCM, entirely understandable! I do wish someone would restore this early gem to a print with a cleaned up picture and sound, but given its age, it is a remarkable treasure of early sound cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great, fun time - needs a better DVD though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first film adaptation of the famous Hecht-MacArthur play about Chicago newspapermen in the late 1920s.A death-row inmate, thought to be insane, is, through inept policing and quack doctoring able to escape.The character of "Professor Max J. Engelhoffer" is a funny parody of Dr. Freud and others like him. The fact that he wants to reenact the crime with an actual, loaded pistol is hilarious, even more hilarious is his surprise at being shot. Gustav von Seyffertitz went un-credited in his role but he is one of the more memorable performers in this farce.And Adolphe Menjou as the newspaper company owner is terrific. His relationship with Pat O'Brien is not simply an angry boss bullying his reporter; these men are friends and have been through a lot. This is reflected in their performances, especially in Menjou's.The only DVD of this movie is from Madacy Entertainment's "Hollywood Classics Collection". This film transfer is horrible and has no more quality than a poor videotape. The picture is bad, but the sound is really a problem. Hearing what a character says is crucial in the understanding of any movie. This could have easily been cleaned up, like so many other movies of the 1930s and earlier are when they are put on DVD.Madacy's DVD does have a few interesting extras, such as some newsreels (not from the 1930s, however) from Pathe News, Inc.I call for a new DVD of this great classic with a pristine transfer of both picture and sound. More people would watch this movie and enjoy this movie if they could hear what the actor's are saying.In any event, I really did like this film a lot. Please see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It doesn't have to rhyme"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the biggest problems facing filmmakers in the early sound era was not a technical one, but one of what form the stories should take. Now that the spoken word was a means of expression, stage plays became a prime source for movie material. The only trouble was that, while the theatre is not necessarily an inferior medium, if you shoot a play simply as it is, no matter how good it would be in the theatre, on the screen it becomes static and dull. There are ways round this problem, and they demonstrate how much of a difference it makes the way in which a movie is filmed.The Front Page's director, Lewis Milestone, was an ostentatious attention-grabber who liked to make every use of the technology at hand. But all his showing-off was for a purpose. As oppose to the limited dimensions of the stage, Milestone is always staging things in extremes of width and depth, especially when introducing major characters. A really neat manoeuvre is when a cop visits the newsroom during a game of poker. The camera sits on the middle of the small table and pans round as each reporter is harangued in turn. A man walking round a table is a fairly low-key bit of business, but this technique makes it simply whirl. There is only one point where I feel it's too much, when the camera "bounces" up and down on the faces of the reporters as they sing a taunting song. But the great thing is Milestone also knows when to tone it down and let the players shine. He often uses a long, still take for a key scene, such as Pat O'Brien and Adolphe Menjou's talk at the bar.But an equally important contribution is the sense of realistic camaraderie between the principle members of the cast. The atmosphere in the newsroom straddles comedic exuberance and realistic banter, and as such is absolutely in the spirit of Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's original work. Adolphe Menjou shows impeccable control, with movements that are almost cartoonish, such as the little backward lean into his stride off after announcing "I'll kill him!" It's a fresh approach, but one that would catch on, being very much the vein of Clark Gable's Oscar-winning performance in It Happened One Night (1934). Lead man Pat O'Brien is at his most extrovert and, in the process, his most likable. Walter Catlett is unflappably brilliant, and there is also a chance to see Edward Everett Horton honing the persona that would make him a fixture throughout the next decade.The result is probably the most vibrant and effective stage adaptation of the early talkies, and it set the tone of much of what was to come, straddling the gap between the wild farce of the Marx Brothers and the sophisticated comedies like Dinner at Eight. Later directors (George Cukor, most notably) would learn to tone down Milestone's approach and create stage-to-screen adaptations that flowed smoothly and were purely cinematic, but The Front Page was nevertheless an important jolt to an industry still trying to find its way, and a lesson in how to make a script low on action and confined in space into something dynamic and brassy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE FRONT PAGE (United Artists, 1931), presented by Howard Hughes, directed by Lewis Milestone, ventures into the mad world of journalism. Taken from the 1928 play by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, set mostly in a press room in a single night where cigar smoking, card playing, tough-talking reporters await for the latest news coverage for their latest scoop for the front page, the final edition goes to its managing editor and his ace reporter, who are the best of friends in spite of their constant feuding."The story is laid in a Mythical Kingdom" where reporters of the Chicago Tribune gather together in the press room of the Criminal Court's Building awaiting to cover the upcoming execution of convicted killer, Earl Williams. Editor Walter Burns (Adolphe Menjou) trusts only Hildebrand "Hildy" Johnson (Pat O'Brien) to cover the story, but Hildy has other plans. He intends leaving the newspaper game to marry Peggy Grant(Mary Brian) where they can live happily ever after in New York. Through tricks and deceit, Walter does everything in his power keeping Hildy from quitting, going to extremes such as hiring "Diamond Louie" (Maurice Black), a notorious gangster, to abduct Hildy's future mother-in-law (Effie Ellsler) as well as separating him from Peggy. Only after Williams (George E. Stone) shoots his way out from the county jail seeking refuge in the press room does Hildy find himself getting the biggest story of his 15-year career, plus an interview with Molly Malloy (Mae Clarke), a streetwalker who believes Earl innocent. Hildy has his work cut out for him keeping both police and reporters from locating Williams, who's hiding in a roll-top desk, and joining forces with Walter as they battle political corruption with Sheriff Hartman (Clarence Wilson) and the Mayor (James Gordon) after learning how they prevented messenger, Irving Pincus (Slim Summerville), from delivering a reprieve for Williams. Stop the Presses!!!! Taking part in the exclusive story are Edward Everett Horton as the germ conscious Roy Bensinger; Walter L. Catlett and Frank McHugh as wisecracking reporters, Murphy and McCue; Matt Moore as the banjo playing Kruger;Dorothea Wolbert as Jenny, the cleaning lady; and Gustav Von Seyffertitz appearing briefly as the psychiatrist. For being a United Artists release, THE FRONT PAGE looks very much like a Warner Brothers production, especially with future Warners stock players, O'Brien and McHugh, in the cast. Regardless of Menjou's star billing and Academy Award nomination for his limited performance, the byline rightfully belongs to O'Brien, in his feature film debut.The success of this Academy Award nominated production, THE FRONT PAGE brought forth notable remakes: HIS GIRL Friday (Columbia, 1940) starring Cary Grant (Walter Burns) and Rosalind Russell (the female Hildy Johnson); THE THRILL OF BRAZIL (Columbia, 1946) with Evelyn Keyes and Keenan Wynn, a musical that borrows portions from HIS GIRL Friday; THE FRONT PAGE (Universal, 1974) starring Walter Matthau (Walter Burns) and Jack Lemmon (Hildy Johnson); and an updated version borrowing from HIS GIRL Friday retitled SWITCHING CHANNELS (Tri-Star, 1988), set in a TV station, with Burt Reynolds, Kathleen Turner and Christopher Reeve. There was even a now forgotten 1970 TV movie of THE FRONT PAGE that featured Robert Ryan.Out of circulation for many years, it wasn't until 1979 when this 1931 original began circulating on television, followed by availability on home video and A&amp;E cable TV broadcasts during the 1980s. Because THE FRONT PAGE is a public domain title, many VHS and DVD transfers have ranged from satisfactory to inferior. To date, the best available print appears on Turner Classic Movies where THE FRONT PAGE has been showing since 2002.Very much a guy movie that may also appeal to women, THE FRONT PAGE does contain lines and situations that may cause any outraged person to write a "letter to the editor." Watch how Menjou gets by in saying "Son of a ... " without having that scene going through censor problems. In spite of its age and 101 minute length, THE FRONT PAGE has enough speed, lively dialog (with serious overtones) and camera movement to rank this one of the finer newspaper stories in circulation today.

		<shortDescription>Brilliant...but also very hard to find a watchable copy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tried watching THE FRONT PAGE at least three different times. However, the first two times the copies I had were unwatchable--with very, very poor sound and washed out prints. The first was a videotape, the second was a DVD. Only when I saw a cleaner print on Turner Classic Movies was I able to enjoy the film. This is because apparently this is a public domain film--and so many of the versions out there are in horrid condition.The reason I wanted to see the film so badly is that it's remake from 1940 (HIS GIRL Friday) is one of the best films of the decade and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Well, now I am glad that I did finally see THE FRONT PAGE because I enjoyed this film almost as much as its remake. This is rare for me because I almost always hate remakes and I can't think of a single example where I liked BOTH about equally.For the most part, the plot and much of the dialog is identical in the two films. However, there are some major changes. First, Hildy Johnson was a man in THE FRONT PAGE but in HIS GIRL Friday there was a sex change! Now Rosalind Russell took on the role originally played by Pat O'Brien and both did great jobs. Additionally, as THE FRONT PAGE was a crude film even by the Pre-Code standards of 1931, you may be surprised to hear some cursing, a scene where a reporter gives the mayor the middle finger and the final crude line of the film (though it is obscured by the loud noise, he's clearly saying a rather foul line). Even by today's very relaxed standards, this is a rather adult film--not better or worse but certainly more realistic because of this.As for the plot, it's already been explained by other reviewers, so I won't "beat a dead horse". However, the film truly excels mostly because of its very cynical and dark writing. The dialog is simply wonderful and the characters are amazingly dark as well. While the actors all did a good job, they couldn't help it due to the play by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur! The only minus, and it didn't bother me in the least, is that in 1931, films were much quieter because incidental music was almost always absent--and this is no exception. However, I actually think it works just fine and makes the film seem a bit more realistic and gritty.Overall, any person who prides themselves on being a student of film should watch this film--it is a classic in the same league as its much more famous cousin, HIS GIRL Friday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as Good as the 1940 Remake, But Has Good Moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the fans of the Hecht - MacArthur stage play THE FRONT PAGE probably think that the 1940 version with Cary Grant, Rosalind Russell, and Ralph Bellamy is the best. It certainly has a spunky approach that is due to the sexual tension of the the female lead with her two male partners. But the play originally had the role of "Hildy Johnson" as a man (played here by Pat O'Brien, and in the later Billy Wilder version by Jack Lemmon) and so those two versions actually are closer to the actual play. Still one of the best lines of the play does not appear in this version. When Molly (Mae Clarke), the streetwalker who befriends Earl Williams (George E. Stone), confronts the reporters as a bunch of lying jackals she is shoved out of the press room by Murphy the reporter (Walter Catlett here). But although her words sear the men (as we see once Catlett shuts the door on her), the same scene in 1940 was handled better by Howard Hughes and Rosalind Russell. Russell led the actress playing Molly out of the room, shuts the door behind them, and then re-enters facing the men who are all shame faced. Quietly, and with dignified disgust, Russell says, "Gentlemen of the Press!" to summarize how they have mangled Williams and Molly Molloy by their lying. As I said, that line is in the play, spoken by Hildy.This version was produced by Howard Hughes, and directed by Lewis Milestone. Milestone's use of a moving camera is obvious in several scenes where we see reporters and characters moving in the reporter's room at the city prison around the central table. This is obvious to counter the fact that much of the play is static - it's a one set play. But the movement reminds one of how Milestone used a moving camera a year earlier in ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT in the sequences showing doomed charges against machine gun emplacements.While not comparable to Cary Grant's Burns in 1940, Adolphe Menjou does make the editor a figure of silent control. He shows up suddenly at the reporters room (after sending several phone calls earlier) while everyone is facing the opposite direction, making his entry properly silent and sinister in its way. Grant was more pompous in the role, while Menjou is a master of psychological approach when he wants (watch how he plays O'Brien to get him to type his news report). Menjou is also seen breaking a law (setting off a fire alarm box to force O'Brien to come into the street).Bits and pieces of business are shown that did not appear in later versions. Slim Summerfield's Mr. Pincus (a nice performance but nothing like that immortal example of kindly befuddlement, Billy Gilbert's Mr. Pettibone in 1940) is seen not only dropping off the pardon from the governor, but seen descending in an elevator. Edward Everett Horton, believing he's going to a better job, is seen trying to get a cab, and finding that he has gone into Mary Brian's by accident. Molly is taken (after injuring herself) to a hospital cell and the reporters are there waiting to see if they can question her. The shooting of Dr. Englehofer (Gustav Von Seyfertitz) with the Warden's (Clarence Wilson's) gun is actually shown here (with the idiot psychiatrist declaring the stunned Williams "dementia praecox".The performances (besides Menjou's) are good. O'Brien is certainly at odds with himself as he sees how much he loves his career, and how much he loves Brian. O'Brien is more aware of her newspaper rival (personified by Menjou) than Bellamy was in the 1940 film. The newspapermen are an interesting mixed bunch, best being Catlett, Frank McHugh (oddly enough his character's name is McCue), and Horton. Horton is quite the hypochondriac fussbudget (Ernest Truex was not quite like this in the 1940 version), constantly spraying against germs, and gargling with Listerine - Catlett, in disgust, asks if Horton can stop stinking up the room with disinfectants! It lacks the surer touch of Hawks, who again and again knew how to make successful film comedies. Milestone usually directed dramas, and while he is not ham handed one misses Hawks better control. Still this 1931 film is a good version, and won't disappoint the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hilarious farce that lives up to its remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE FRONT PAGE (1931) is a snappy, quick-witted comedy about a newspaper man trying to leave the business and get married while his peers scramble to cover the story of the year. The movie is based on a stage play, and the same story was adapted (with some tweaks) in 1940 for Howard Hawks's brilliant HIS GIRL_FRIDAY, starring Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell.I absolutely love HIS GIRL_FRIDAY and wasn't expecting much from this earlier and lesser-known version. But I must say that THE FRONT PAGE is itself a terrific film that, though slightly different (but mostly similar), is just as great as HIS GIRL_FRIDAY. (The wonderful humor must be inherent in the original play.)The ensemble cast is superb, including Pat O'Brien as the soon-to-be-married star reporter, Adolphe Menjou as his big shot editor, Clarence Wilson as the harassed sheriff, George E. Stone as a condemned man, and a roomful of reporters including Frank McHugh, Walter Catlett, and Edward Everett Horton.Made in 1931, early on in the sound era, the movie certainly looks pretty old. But I thought it was great. The script is very witty and the direction (by Oscar-winner Lewis Milestone) is good. I particularly enjoyed the direction in the pressroom scenes, with all of the reporters and all of the phones and the various snippets of conversation.Also, being a "pre-code" comedy, there are some bits that might have been deemed too vulgar had the film been made only a few years later. There are some allusions to promiscuity, some almost swear words, and even a brief instance of "flipping the bird".HIS GIRL_FRIDAY (1940) is an all-time classic screwball comedy. But if you enjoyed that film, you're sure to love THE FRONT PAGE (1931). The story is basically the same (there's less of a romantic angle as the star reporter is a man in this version), but a lot of the jokes are fresh. And this version offers wonderful performances by Menjou, Catlett, Horton, et al. Both movies are delightful comedies, and it's too bad that this earlier version isn't as well remembered as its remake.THE FRONT PAGE is a classic in its own right, and was nominated for three big Academy Awards: Best Actor, Best Director, and Best Picture. I'd definitely recommend checking it out whenever you can find it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the classic rendition filmed in 1931 titled ¨The Front Page¨ by Lewis Milestone with big cast as Adolph Menjou , Edward Everett Horton , Mae Clark and Pat O'Brien in his film debut . Acceptable version about known story in which a reporter wants to marry a beautiful woman but his mean editor impedes it . Rip-roaring vintage newspaper comedy ¨The Front Page¨ and subsequently , 1940 , the best retelling titled ¨His girl friend¨ and acceptable acting from everyone . Cynical editor named Walter Burns (Louis Wolheim was originally cast to play him , but Adolphe Menjou got the part when Wolheim died suddenly , this character was based on a famed editor) wants to get a big scoop on an execution which involves convincing star reporter Hildy Johnson (Pat O'Brien , whose role was based on the real-life a notorious reporter) to come back to work and put off her marriage to handsome millionaire Peggy Grant (Mary Brian) . Walter tries to keep him in town and break up her upcoming marriage takes place against the backdrop of a botched death row . Hildy can't resist covering some good news , even when it mean helping a condemned man getaway the law as she attempts to help an innocent man is about to be executed . And the escaped convicted murderer offers the journalist an exclusive interview . Other reporters also give hilarious acting in this breathless pursuit of an exclusive with the escaped death row inmate .Great cast gives powerful performances as Adolphe Menjou as a scheming publisher and Pat O'Brien as a convincing as well as incautious journalist . Agreeable play and screenplay from Ben Hecht , Charles MacArthur about a cunning managing editor of a known newspaper and his ambitious reporter . The journalists are all based on actual reporters who were Chicago colleagues of authors Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, with most working alongside them at the courthouse ; the real names were only slightly changed . Bartlett Cormack Charles Lederer's brilliantly tart dialogue overlaps story to carry the black farce along the roller-coasted speed . Attractive performance from Pat O'Brien as ace journalist who wants to quit the business and get married and likable Adolphe Menjou as an editor who finds out his main reporter wants to leave him and gets in the way . Inventive and furious screen combats in which Adolphe Menjou and Pat O'Brien are given equal footing with staccato dialog and sparkling interpretations . Phenomenal playing from everyone , including a top-notch secondary cast such as Edward Everett Horton , George Stone , Mae Clarke , Slim Summerville and Matt Moore . Mediocre cinematography by cinematographer Hal Mohr who replaced Tony Gaudio , being necessary an alright remastering because of film copy is worn-out and suffers the public domain . Professional direction by Lewis Milestone render more funny than usual , and achieved success enough . Rating : 6,5 . Worthwhile watching . Other versions about this this frequent-told story are the followings : The play "The Front Page" opened at the Times Square Theater on August 14, 1929, and ran for 276 performances . As Osgood Perkins , Anthony Perkins's father , created the role of Walter Burns on the Broadway stage . And "Academy Award Theater" broadcast a 30 minute radio adaptation of the movie on June 22, 1946 with Adolphe Menjou and Pat O'Brien reprising their film roles . In cinema a classic adaptation titled ¨His Girl Friday ¨ 1940 , it makes some memorable exchanges , directed by Howard Hawks with Gary Grant , Ralph Bellamy and Rosalind Russell with the pivotal character assigned to a woman instead a man ; and do't miss this stunning adaptation ¨The front page¨ by the great Billy Wilder with Jack Lemmon as journalist , Walter Matthaw as managing editor and Carol Burnett . And 1988 new recounting , a modernized fourth remake titled ¨Switching Channels¨ in which an attractive TV anchorwoman want to marry tycoon but his mean ex-husband impedes it , starred by Burt Reynolds , Kathleen Turner , and Christopher Reeve , being directed by Ted Kotcheff .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>His Man Friday</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bustling Chicago press-room is about to lose top "Examiner" writer Pat O'Brien (as Hildy Johnson), who wants to quit reporting after fifteen years, to marry Mary Brian (as Peggy Grant). But, managing editor Adolphe Menjou (as Walter Burns) wants Mr. O'Brien to stay, and cover stories like the execution by hanging of George E. Stone (as Earl Williams). The plot thickens when Mr. Williams escapes from jail, and tightens when O'Brien meets the convicted killer."The Front Page" was held in high regard for the way director Lewis Milestone made a staid, one-room stage play really MOVE on the big screen. There were "Academy Award" nominations for "Best Picture", "Best Director", and "Best Actor". The later went to Mr. Menjou, although O'Brien is arguably the film's leading actor. Menjou had taken over the role when Louis Wolheim died; either man would have been up for a "Supporting Actor" award, had they been given."This story is laid in a mythical kingdom," by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, the writers who deserved "The Front Page" award.******* The Front Page (3/19/31) Lewis Milestone ~ Pat O'Brien, Adolphe Menjou, Mary Brian, Edward Everett Horton</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty press of the past stars in this comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1931 movie is the first made from the Broadway smash hit by the same name that opened in 1928. The author of the play, Ben Hecht, was the principal screenwriter for this United Artists film. This version probably sticks closest to the original script of the stage play. The setting is perfect for transition from stage to silver screen. It needed only one major set and a couple of smaller ones. Even though it's a comedy, "The Front Page" is a gritty portrayal of the working press of the day. Some of it is undoubtedly tongue-in- cheek. But the portrayal of the sensationalism among the reporters and papers, to the point of fiction and manufacturing stories is a realistic picture of the culture of the time. The press held considerable clout in those days, and news stories could get public officials in trouble. Especially if those articles were real "stories" ? with more opinion and fabrication than fact. At the same time, many ? mostly men -- working within the press had no scruples about embellishing stories or garnishing the facts and truth. The whole drive was to make splashy headlines and sensational stories. That's what sold newspapers. So, this film is a good portrayal of the big city press of the day. And the cast consists of actors who play the parts of reporters very well, and of an unscrupulous managing editor in another. The latter is Walter Burns, played superbly by Adolphe Menjou. He's a perfect picture of a hardened, driving editor. He's been on the beat and on the streets. He know all the tricks of the trade. His ace reporter is Hildy Johnson, played very well but it seems to me a bit tamely by Pat O'Brien. Mary Brian plays Peggy Grant, Hildy's fiancé. Among the rival reporters in the jailhouse or courthouse press room are Edward Everett Horton as Bensinger, Walter Catlett as Murphy and Frank McHugh as McCue. The film also castigates in comedy and buffoonery the local politics of the time. In this case that's the locally elected sheriff and the mayor. Clarence Wilson plays Sheriff Hartman and James Gordon is the mayor. The other major characters are Earl Williams and Molly. Earl is the convicted murderer who is set to be hanged the next day. Molly is a street woman who has befriended Earl. George Stone and Mae Clarke play their roles superbly.With the overtones of criminal justice, political corruption, inept public servants facing an election, and seeming indifferent attitudes of reporters about justice and a man's life, the story is a battle of wits between Burns and Johnson. For the moment, it's about getting a sensational front page story out. But in the long run, Burns is conniving to get Johnson to stay on his staff instead of leaving the city to marry Peggy. This story has been filmed a few times, and has been revived on Broadway. It's a popular story and play among actors and the public. This original film version does the best to capture the sense of the times and culture in which the story takes place. It's more realistic with its grittiness. Another version is my favorite for the comedy. The quality of this film that I watched on DVD was not very good. It was not a remastered or cleaned up copy, but was an old scratchy and blotchy film similar to what we used to see on late night TV back in 1950s and 1960s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iconic Play.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewing it now is like looking at a cinematic coelacanth, a thing long extinct, now coming to the surface unexpectedly in semi-fossilized form. It's easy to see why there have been so many versions of the play by Hecht and MacArthur. It's risqué, cynical, fast paced, and it sweeps you up in the characters and the story.This one was directed by Lewis Milestone. It's not the funniest or the fastest version but it has a few gags the others lack, and Milestone does some inexplicable tricks with the camera. If the half dozen men in the press room are laughing, Milestone gives us a second-long shot of the first. The camera tilts upward to the ceiling, then down to the second reporter for another moment, then the ceiling, then the third reporter. Cuts would have been quicker but I suppose, given the nature of the early sound equipment, when the cameras were enclosed in dirigibles the size of the Hindenburg, it must have seemed like a novel idea. In another shot, a reporter is speaking (or yelling) into the phone in medium shot. From the side of the screen, somebody's crossed legs intrude, with one shod foot bouncing up and down.I don't want to get too technical here because, after all, I don't know what I'm talking about, but I'm assuming a certain familiarity with the plot. There are a few unobtrusive gags that I haven't noticed in the other versions. The scene shows the press room interior. A door opens in the far right and a reporter dashes in, handing his coat to Pat O'Brien, who immediately tosses it on the floor behind him. It's not as marked as it is in the Marx Brothers' movie, but for that reason it's just as funny. Another example. O'Brien needs to pass through a crowded knot of reporters. Instead of roughly pushing his way through, he turns sideways and does a little ballet leap a la seconde, a waiter steering a tray full of plates through a crowded room. It just takes a moment, but then everything in the movie just takes a moment.Well, one more. Dr. Egglehoffer is brought in to examine the prisoner and in the course of "reenacting dzah crime", the prisoner shoots Egglehoffer in the belly. The doctor wavers back and forth a bit before pointing an accusing finger at his patient and shouting, "Dementia PRAECOX!", then falls forward like a mannequin.There's a lot of social commentary lurking behind the gags. These were pre politically correct days. It's not a polemic though. Only enough material to twit your conscience about self-righteousness, corruption, racism, and violence.As editor Walter Burns, we see less of Adolph Menjou than I'd expected. The focal point is Pat O'Brien's Hildebrand Johnson. The press room is full of the usual colorful characters. Of the three versions I'm familiar with, I'd put Howard Hawks' first and Billy Wilder's second. However, I'd give this version a bonus point because it was the first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Birth of the Screwball Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Early Talkie from the Legendary Journalist and Author of the Play, Ben Hecht, the Original Work has had at Least Four Remakes. While Everyone Swoons Over His Girl Friday (1940), Without this there would not have been that. The Director does Everything He Can but Cinematically the Restraints of the Time were Somewhat Confining. He Uses Swirling Techniques and some Trickery to keep the Movie from having a Stage-Woozy Stagnation. The Dialog comes Fast and Furious Developing what would Become Known as the Screwball Comedy. It is a Cynical and at times Rather Racist Rant from Crusty Journalists that Today would be Called Nerds.There is much to Enjoy in this Relic and like a Fine Antique Shows its Age with a Certain Worn Beauty. The Cast is Spot On and it is a Madcap Movie Inviting Sound Comedy to take its Place among the Silents. It Succeeds and in This the Words Literally Prick the Pictures with an an Overwhelming and Manic Urgency that seems to Say..."We were here first."Beware Inferior Public Domain Prints that are Unwatchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We have come a long way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was watching this movie, and I thought, parts of this plot seemed familiar. Then I remembered there was a remake in 1974 with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau that was not great, but at least had some good laughs.This is a very old movie, and it shows. The dialogue is muffled. The actors talk very fast as the running gag. It is hard to catch much of the dialogue. It is boring boring boring. Even the scene when they hide the escaped convict in the desk is wooden.It is mostly about a group of old newspaper men sitting around a table being rude to each other with insults that don't make much sense.The actors take turns mugging silently for the camera. It is so amateurish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Filmed Play more than a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They pretty much shot the stageplay plus some exteriors. Some interesting and camera angles.The story itself is great in all its incarnations. To see in it in its original is an education in stage and movie play; also, the pre-Hayes code movies could be pretty raunchy in subject and language.The actors bellow their lines here because a) that was the stage technique of the time - no sound systems in the theaters in 1931, and b) the sound systems of the movies of 1931 weren't much better than the silents.I wish only that someone find the negative - if it hasn't already dissolved - and clean it up via the computer. Were it not for the 1974 re-make (my favorite) I would have had no idea what the actors were shouting in this version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting material, just awfully executed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the Hecht-MacArthur play, a newspaper editor and his ace reporter battle each other while fighting civic corruption in Chicago. You better be in good shape if you wanna survive this one. Is it just me or did I miss something here? Nearly two hours of badly recorded shouting in this early talkie with barely intelligible dialog, absolutely exhausting. But perhaps it's just the bad transfer on the DVD.The fact that this film received three academy award nominations, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Picture, is illustrative for the difficulties regarding sound in the these early stages of sound in film-making. These technical deficiencies came with the period and might be easily forgiven, if there was something of cinematic interest to be found, but this is not film-making. It's a filmed play and a bad one at that. Badly shot, badly lit and the stagy acting style doesn't help either, with just about everyone shouting their lines to the ceiling or the windows, wherever the microphones are hidden. I guess the material is OK, based on the later adaptations of he piece, but it's almost impossible to figure it out, so distracted is the viewer by the constant clamoring. I know it's an early talkie but that's no reason to ignore the far too many shortcomings of this film. If you like the material, remade infinitely better by Howard Hawks as HIS GIRL Friday (1940), better but not brilliant by Billy Wilder as THE FRONT PAGE (1974) and yet again as SWITCHING CHANNELS (1988) with Kathleen Turner and Christopher Reeve. Save yourself a headache and watch these instead.Camera Obscura --- 3/10</fullReview>
