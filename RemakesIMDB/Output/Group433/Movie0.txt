		<shortDescription>Slapstick comedy that moves faster than the speed of laughter...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This screen adaptation of the Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur play "The Front Page" was adapted for the talents of Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell -- there is no such character as Hildy Johnson (Russell) in that play.Director Howard Hawks wanted to show the whirlwind pace of the newsroom in the criminal courts system so he had his actors overlap their lines -- so much so that at times it seems as though everyone is talking at once; it even gets difficult to understand all that is going on.He also had the cast move FAST so the film looks totally frenetic from scene to scene with no respite -- either from the laughs or from the action.There are two really good "inside" jokes in the script: The first is where Walter Burns (Grant) is describing Hildy's fiancee and says that "he looks like that guy in the movies -- Bellamy," Well, it WAS Ralph Bellamy playing that part!The other is when Burns says something about someone he once knew named "Archie Leach" which just happens to be Cary Grant's real name.This is one of the true gems of Hollywood's most prolific era. It has incredible pacing, acting, photography and an authentic gritty feeling that would be associated with hard-boiled, "anything for a story" newspaper people.It has long been one of my favorite films and deserves to be watched over and over again -- just for all the dialogue and great acting that may have gone by so fast you missed it the first time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a gem!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching the DVD of this first-class, semi-Screwball comedy in Columbia Classics beautiful transfer, and it absolutely made my day! What a movie! What a screenplay! The dialogue is better - more modern - in fact, than a in lot of contemporary movies. It's incredibly funny, too, and my teenage sons kept laughing right along with me at the smart come-backs. Cary Grant is, of course, as good (if not better) than ever, and I've never seen Rosalind Russel in a role that suited her more perfectly. And that's just for starters: The timing of the thing is still awe- inspiring after sixty-odd years; the supporting actors, down to the bit-players, are all memorable, convincing and hilarious; the camera work (this IS the forties, though) is inventive and the editing superb. I can safely confess now that I hadn't ever seen it before, but that's no reason for you to make the same mistake: Go buy/rent it NOW! Hats off to the great Howard Hawks, his cast and crew for pulling this comedy masterpiece off. And thank you, thank you, thank you Columbia Pictures, formaking it possible for me to watch it in such pristine condition! (I've got the 2002 edition, and from what I've heard you should beware of earlier DVD issues).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Her Guy Walter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charles McArthur and Ben Hecht met when both were reporters in Chicago during the 1920s. They created two of the funniest farces in American drama, TWENTIETH CENTURY (about theater people) and THE FRONT PAGE. The latter was based on their experiences as news reporters in those crazy days in Chicago, where the newspapers concentrated on sensationalism and the politics was thoroughly corrupt. The resulting play is hysterically funny and yet remains timely. For all the exaggeration of how Walter Burns and Hildy Johnson manipulate police, politicians, reporters, and civilians to get their scoop, the story remains relevant for several reasons. The political balance in a big Mayoralty election is precarious due to the Earl Williams case. Williams has shot a policeman who is African-American, a big local voting block, and they want him punished. The corrupt Mayor and his idiot jail warden are willing to execute him for the votes needed to stay in office, but the Governor (who is from the rival party) believes the killer is insane (or at least mentally deficient). So already (as you see) race, politics, and the validity of the death penalty get pulled in. Soon we also see examples of nepotism and corruption in the police, and City Hall, cynical politics based on a man's life, and questions about privacy and a free press. For a play from 1931 this one still has relevance.There had been an earlier version of the play in the 1930s called THE FRONT PAGE, starring Adolphe Menjou as the conniving and devious Walter Burns, and Pat O'Brien as ace reporter Hildy Johnson. It is a good version, and both stars do well with their parts (and both have the verbal speed necessary for the dialog to flow over the ears of the audience). But when the film was remade in 1940, Howard Hawks decided to redraw Hildy Johnson into a female reporter (and previous wife) of Burns. His casting of Cary Grant was radically different too. Burns is a nasty, conniving s.o.b. who would kill for a good story. Menjou was somewhat dapper (he was usually dapper) in the role, but the hardness under the presentable shell was there. And by changing Hildy from a guy to a gal, and Walter's former wife, you had to make Walter look more interesting. So Walter is turned into Cary Grant. There was a search for Hildy, involving Jean Arthur and Irene Dunne as possibilities. Neither ended up playing him. Instead it went to Rosalind Russell.It has to be admitted Russell had the vocal abilities to push the dialog at the proper clip. Possibly Jean Arthur could have done that just as well, but Arthur did not have the apparent physical strength behind the stylishness that Russell showed. She really does balance well (in this film) with Grant, given their characters.Motivation changes a little. This Walter Burns still wants to get his scoops, but there are moments of fragility when he realizes he may forever lose Hildy to her fiancé Bruce (the ever helpless Ralph Bellamy). And they oddly work (Hawks manages to keep them under control). Also, as the story is now twelve years older than the original play, certain changes occur in Walter's political views. He does dislike the gang (led by Clarence Kolb and Gene Lockhart) running the city, and points out to Hildy that they have a chance to help give the city the sort of government New York City has under La Guardia. This does not end his joy at scooping the opposition, but it does suggest that Burns has more depth.It is now generally believed that this is the best of the film versions of THE FRONT PAGE, and one of the funniest films ever made. The entire cast shines (look at the scene where Helen Mack confronts the reporters who have made her look like a tramp, and have told lies about John Qualen (Williams) - she is in a state when Russell takes her out of the press room, and the reporters are thoroughly ashamed of herself - and Russell comes back looking at Regis Toomey, Porter Hall, and the others, and says "Gentlemen of the Press!" with heavy cynical irony). And also note Billy Gilbert's immortal Joe Pettibone, the most hopeless monument of total befuddlement in movies. It is one of the few film comedies of that period that retains it's laughs one viewing following another.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Front Page remade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This gloriously funny romp by Howard Hawks is rightly remembered as one of the fastest-talking movies ever made. Originally done as 'The Front Page', the play by Hecht and McArthur takes on new life here as the character of Hildy Johnson metamorphoses in this version to be a sparky woman (played by Rosalind Russell), former wife of the harassed columnist Walter Burns (played with characteristic bewilderment and charm by Cary Grant). Hildy is about to marry again, to the nice but dull Bruce Baldwin (played by Ralph Bellamy as a character so boring he 'is like Ralph Bellamy' - how Hollywood liked its in-jokes).With that fire-cracking script, a sizable amount of sparks between Grant and Russell, and good support from Bellamy and a cast which includes Gene Lockhart, Cliff Edwards, Clarence Kolb, and Regis Toomey, 'His Girl Friday' is one of those classic gems which never age and which remain hugely entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roz Russell Is on the Case</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every good thing you've heard about this movie is true. It may very well be the fastest paced movie I've ever seen. Jerry Bruckheimer's most hyperbolic action movie ain't got nothing' on this one.Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell were a brilliant screen pair (indeed, it seems that no one was bad casting when paired with Cary Grant) as rival reporters in a furiously paced news office. Russell is the odd man, or should I say odd girl, out, due to her lack of a penis, but she proves herself more than capable of holding her own with the boys.Russell charges across the screen and never loses momentum for a second. She's goofy, sexy and hysterical. The funniest moment in the film comes when she's chasing a man down the street (I won't go into details) and dive tackles him to the ground.One of the first films from the 40s and a highlight of the decade.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real screamer (knowing journalists from firsthand experience)!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be one of the most wickedly funny films there is, and I think it's much better than the earlier version with Adolphe Menjou and Pat O'Brien (even though that was funny too). The fact that the boss and employee were ex-husband and wife battling it out made it funnier than simply an employer trying to keep a friend and employee.Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant really clicked in this, and it's a shame they never worked together again. And as one who worked in journalism for 20 plus years, (the legitimate version I hope), there really are characters out there carrying tape recorders and microphones who'd do anything for a story. I laughed so hard because I could remember certain "gentlemen and gentlewomen" in the business slitting each other's throats (figuratively speaking) to get the story first, whether accurate or not.The dialogue was crisp and the movie is very fast paced, and all the supporting actors shone and added to the overall success of the film. And as always, you've got to love the happy ending! Give it giga-stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As close to perfection as any film could hope for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As if creating one comedic masterpiece with 1938's BRINGING UP BABY was not enough, director Howard Hawks returned to the same genre a scant two years later - and he somehow managed to rival even his own previous masterwork. Nominally a reworking Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's play THE FRONT PAGE, HIS GIRL Friday manages to surpass it's classic source material and emerge as one of the screen's finest comedies. The film is also perhaps the perfect example of Hawks' trademarked rapid-fire, overlapping dialogue, which has never been as fast nor as furious anywhere else before or since. This is certainly one of the fastest moving comedies ever filmed, and the whole cast never misses a beat.Walter Burns, the conniving, self-serving newspaper editor, is a character that could have easily come off as a tyrannical jerk. As portrayed by the suave Cary Grant, however, the pompous, arrogant Burns actually becomes (gasp!) likable! It is a difficult balancing act that Grant must perform as teetering between the two extremes of the character, and he is arguably the only actor imaginable with the skill and charisma to pull such a tricky characterization off this successfully. And the one-and-only Rosalind Russell is every bit his match - full of verve and aplomb, Russell's Hildy is an independent career woman, brimming with intelligence and class, that impressively pre-dates the major feminist movement of the mid-sixties by a good 25 years.The film's supporting cast is no less impressive, with every single role cast to perfection. This is particularly true of Ralph Bellamy, who (along with his Oscar-nominated performance in 1937's THE AWFUL TRUTH) proves once again that he is the ultimate straight man. The film contains some grim subject matter that may seem like unlikely fodder for a screwball comedy (murder, attempted suicide, and public execution are all touched upon), although the film somehow manages to deal with such topics respectfully and without sacrificing any laughs. In the end, HIS GIRL Friday is an absolutely unbeatable romantic comedy that remains wildly hilarious and comes as close to sheer perfection as any motion picture could ever hope to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Man Will Do For Love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If BRINGING UP BABY has rapid-fire dialogue and one crazy scene after the other, HIS GIRL Friday goes even faster and is 10 minutes shorter. A story not that un-similar to THE PHILADELPHIA STORY which deletes the scatterbrained socialites in favor for a gritty, urban setting, Cary Grant is fantastic in his role as Walter Burns as he tries to win back his wife Hildy Johnson (an equally brilliant Rosalind Russell in full comic mode) by literally throwing her back into what she -- deep down -- loves best: reporting and the breakneck lifestyle that comes with being in front of the news. These two are on camera often, and their dialogue together is like a frenzied waltz: trying to follow every exact word, gesture, and snarl is quite a task, boy, does it sizzle! What a shame that this wasn't up for any awards, as this could have easily won in acting categories. Completely ahead of its times, this is an interesting view on feminism thirty years before the term became public knowledge, and if one listens closely, a study in verbal sexual interplay. Which shows that making Hildy Johnson a woman was the best decision a director could ever do to enhance a story.A remake of an earlier film (THE FRONT PAGE, 1931), itself a film version of a 1928 play, HIS GIRL Friday was remade again as THE FRONT PAGE in 1976 and yet again in 1988 as SWITCHING CHANNELS, with Kathleen Turner nicely holding up in her portrayal of the role that cemented Rosalind Russell as a skilled comedienne, this time set in media TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Unseen Power That Protects The Morning Post</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whoever had the bright idea to turn the Ben Hecht-Charles MacArthur play, The Front Page into a boy and girl comedy ought to get a Nobel Prize for comedy if such an award had been available at the time. Of course it helps when one of your two main characters has an ambiguous first name like Hildy. Short for Hildreth when Pat O'Brien plays it, Rosalind Russell is all female in this one. Russell bites off a huge chunk of Katherine Hepburn career woman territory here and she digests it well. She's the best reporter on the staff of the Morning Post and her editor Cary Grant doesn't want to lose her no way. At one time he even married her, but that didn't take. They're divorced now and Russell is fed up and decides she wants a home and children and security and Ralph Bellamy is going to give her all of that. Plus a home with his mother Alma Kruger for a year in Albany.As her friendly rival reporter Regis Toomey says, there ain't no way that Russell could ever leave the newspaper game. She proves it when she goes to work on that one last assignment to cover an execution at the state penitentiary.Even though Howard Hawks did add a romance into The Front Page he did not sacrifice one iota of the biting satire from Hecht and MacArthur. If you watch the either The Front Page or His Girl Friday or even the remake from the eighties Broadcast News you will swear the world is made up of boobs and nitwits and the only smart people around are journalists. Too often however that's proved to be the case.Poor meek John Qualen who was listening to some radicals speaking and got caught up in the moment and accidentally shot a black police officer. Back then ethnic politics were played to the hilt and a law and order mayor, Clarence Kolb, wants to see Qualen executed. His brother-in-law, sheriff Gene Lockhart means to see the sentence is done.Cary Grant's paper is against capital punishment at least for this poor schnook. Of course when Qualen escapes all kinds of complication arise and Russell's on the job to report them.As he was in The Awful Truth, Ralph Bellamy is there to be the slightly befuddled doofus who loses the girl to fast talking Cary. Bellamy's performance is a brilliant piece of work itself. He's so funny because he plays the part absolutely straight and the humor falls around him.Howard Hawks assembles a really grand cast of memorable character actors. My favorite however, brief though his scenes are is Billy Gilbert who is a messenger from the governor who is delivering a sentence commutation. The poor man gets waylaid and involved in all kinds of intrigue that is all going on over his head. You have to see him to believe how funny he is and he does it without a sneeze.His Girl Friday successfully combines screwball romantic comedy with biting satire and no seams show it all in the stitching. It's a blueprint on how to do successful cinema comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another version of "The Front Page" starring Grant and Russell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell make great sparring partners in "His Girl Friday," a remake of "The Front Page." Grant plays the conniving newspaper publisher Walter Johnson, and Rosalind Russell is the reporter Hildy Johnson, a woman this time, and Johnson's ex-wife. She's trying to get remarried, move to Albany, and quit the newspaper business, but Walter can't bear it. He cons her into helping out with a controversial death row case and then makes sure her fiancée (Ralph Bellamy) suffers a series of mishaps - arrest for stealing a watch, arrest for "mashing," arrest for counterfeiting, and the theft of his wallet. This all happens while Hildy interviews Earl Williams, a man due to be hung the next day... and then hides him in a roll-top desk in the courthouse press room when he escapes during a psychiatric evaluation.It's madcap, all right, and there are no two better people to carry it off than Grant and Russell, who make a great team. It's a hilarious story, with the most rapid-fire, non-stop dialog ever heard anywhere, often with several conversations going on at once. It's exhausting trying to keep up with it.Strangely, without computers and cell phones, the story of journalists working on a story holds up because the emotions and activities are realistic and still go on. It's as Hildy describes - no set schedule, no normal meals, and long hours. Nothing much has changed.This is a frenetic comedy, and while the impending hanging of Earl Williams is certainly serious, this plot is more of an excuse to observe the machinations of Hildy and Walter - it's a subplot, though it drives the main story."The Front Page" is a favorite of Hollywood's, remade many times - three versions under its original title, a TV series, two TV productions, plus the film "Switching Channels." And of course, "His Girl Friday," possibly the best of all of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"His Gal Friday" is Howard Hawks' tribute to the brilliant play in which this film is based. Charles McGraw and Ben Hecht, two of the best writers of the era, paid tribute to the journalists that wrote for the American newspapers of the thirties. This movie has some of the fastest dialogs in memory.The incredible combination of Cary Grant, Rosalind Russell, and Ralph Bellamy in the main roles is what made this movie a favorite. Mr. Grant as Walter Burns, the unscrupulous newspaper editor, is the perfect foil for Rosalind Russell's, Hildy Johnson, a role that is played by a male in the original play and in the other film versions.The best moment of the film is the moment when Cary Grant speaking so fast, that some what he says goes over the viewer's heads, refers as to Ralph Bellamy by name as not having a chance and cites in the same breadth his real name Archibald Leach. It's hard to imagine anyone but Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell playing Walter and Hildy. Ralph Bellamy is perfect as Hildy's fiancé, Bruce Baldwin. Gene Lockhart is perfect as the sheriff Pinky Hartwell. The ensemble of actors that play the reporters following the possible execution of Earl Williams, are perfect.An excellent comedy thanks to the genius of Howard Hawks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loud, fast and annoying.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know this is considered a classic and all but I couldn't find myself liking it all that much. I don't know but lots of people talking loudly at the same time over each others lines is just not my idea of something funny.On top of that the movie doesn't really feature any good likable main characters. Despite the fact that I like Cary Grant and he was always able to play a likable scoundrel, his character in this movie just didn't worked out to me. He was more a very selfish character than a funny one really and more annoying than amusing. Same goes for Rosalind Russell, who basically plays the same sort of character as Grant. They really deserved each other.The movie entirely goes for its screwball comedy elements but it forgets basically everything else. It forgets it has a story with also some romantic as well as dramatic elements in it. Because of this none of the romance and more serious intended moments within the movie just didn't ever worked out.To be honest, I quite liked the movie in the beginning and in general I'm also fond of these type of movies, especially when they star Cary Grant but about halve way through the movie totally started to loose track and the movie became an huge fast going mess. It's pace becomes incredibly high and lots of character constantly show up and are going away again just as fast as they came. The movie at that point basically becomes more of an annoying one to watch and it doesn't get any more better when it heads toward its ending.It's not like I hated watching this movie and it certainly does has its moments but for a movie that is considered a true genre classic, it's definitely a disappointing one.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** This review may contain spoilers *** His Girl Friday starts out strong with witty banter exchanged by Cary Grant as Walter Burns and Rosalind Russell as Hildy Johnson. Cary and Rosalind had a lot of chemistry in this film. Walter Burns is a blunt, impatient, controlling, man. I started out with a bit of sympathy for Hildy, who plays a woman who just wants a normal life away from journalism. Both characters turn out to be manipulative,unsympathetic, and very similar. The plot loses steam and is not very interesting, and is full of annoying characters. Everyone seems really corrupt. The movie started off really interesting, but couldn't sustain itself.</fullReview>

(Not quite a dream class since the essays were difficult) When asked by my professor, I said out loud "I didn't like it." I cared more about the fiancée then all others characters combined. He was treated like dirt and I did not find humor in it. The film does glorify the two main characters and their rude personalities. And that's the point of the film. Their dialog is very witty, though (of course) scripted. In compliment of the film, it did keep my attention.

		<shortDescription>Fast Dialogue only savior for unsympathetic characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I learned about Howard Hawkes screwball comedy "His Girl Friday," one of the biggest attractions, I was told, was the fast-paced/overlapping dialogue. During this time in Hollywood, dialogue would only be spoken by one person at a time. "His Girl Friday" was one of the first films to have characters speaking at the same time, often over one another; this would create an environment that was more realistic, especially in a place such as a newspaper room. Well, if that's what Hawkes was going for, he certainly achieved it.The best thing about the film IS the dialogue. Characters speak at a break-neck speed, throwing witticisms left and right as if they were candy. Many times, while one is laughing at one joke, they would miss another right after it. That is how quickly the jokes are thrown out in the film. Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are great at spilling lines out seemingly without any problem. It's a real testament to how professional these two were (along with the rest of the cast) with the amount of verbal meat they had to chew; I can't think of an actor today that could possibly pull of the kind of dialogue that was given in this film.The problem that I had with the film was that the dialogue was the ONLY great thing about it. Unfortunately, the characters and situations presented in the film had little sympathy and lack of any kind of real depth. The situation with the falsely accused murderer was handled poorly given the context of his predicament; instead of really caring about this person and really trying to help him become cleared of charges, the Grant and Rosalind characters instead used him for their own purposes in getting "the big scoop." Now, of course one can argue that that WAS the reason they treated him the way they did, my issue is that such a serious subject was handled in a supposed "comedic" fashion; as if it was OK that this falsely accused person can be treated in such a horrible way, simply because it handled comedically. The last-second deus ex machina that sealed this person's fate supports the idea that his story wasn't really handled with any kind of importance.The thing the really hurt the film was the love triangle between the Grant and Rosalind characters, and the Rosalind's character's fiancé. We are told in the beginning of the film that Grant and Rosalind are divorcees, and Rosalind is set to marry her fiancé the very next day in Albany. Of course, in a film like this, we are supposed to root for the Grant and Rosalind characters to get together at the end. the problem is, the Grant character is such a manipulative creep that at the end of the film I found myself actually rooting for the fiancé to the win the girl. Three times in the movie, the Grant character manipulates the situation, causing the fiancé to be thrown in jail, and preventing the would-be married couple from leaving the city. This in turn gives the Grant character enough time to convince Rosalind that she will always be "a newspaperman." The Rosalind character isn't much better either. Throughout the beginning of the film, she keeps explaining to others that she is through with the newspaper business, that she wants to settle down, raise a family, and not have to deal with the daily grind of hunting down a story. Well, does settling down and having a family sound like a bad thing to you? I didn't think so. Every time she tries to leave, she gets bogged down and distracted by the story (many times through the very fault of the Grant character). It gets so bad, that when the fiancé comes to her, begging her to leave with him, she brushes him off like a fly, barely acknowledging him. Even worse, when the fiancé's mother comes into play, the Rosalind character actually ALLOWS Grant to have her kidnapped and taken away! "His Girl Friday" would've worked if the filmmakers had cared enough about the characters than they did about the dialogue. The actor playing the fiancé did a thankless job; without much to work with, he actually created a character we cared about more so than the two leads. Sure he was a little simple, but that's a lot more than can be said about the other two. At the end of the film, I thought to myself "these two characters were divorced before the film started. Based on all the manipulative actions these two had throughout the story, is there any evidence that they'll stay together once the movie is over?" Maybe they deserve each other, because they certainly don't deserve anyone else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ace in the Hole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"'His Girl Friday' represents one of the major paradoxes of American narrative cinema ? Hollywood's ability to incorporate images of social change into films that ultimately deny and frustrate the possibility of such change." - Tom PowersBefore Wilder's "Ace in the Hole" and Mackendrick's "Sweet Smell of Success" there was "His Girl Friday", Howard Hawks' motor-mouthed screwball comedy and light-hearted satire of both journalism and Chicago politics.The film is based on a 1928 play by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, but it was Hawks who came up with the idea of making the lead a woman. "Write em as a guy and cast em as a broad," was Hawks' motto, a technique which resulted in a filmography filled with strong, masculine, bawdy women. This time around our heroine is Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell), a star reporter who has recently divorced Walter Burns (Cary Grant), editor at the Morning Post.Like most screwballs, "His Girl Friday" finds Walter and Hildy engaged in a battle of wits. They can't stand each another, but Walter nevertheless spends the entire film scheming to repair his relationship with Hildy. When the film's couple aren't cracking wise, Hawks engages in an altogether different affair, excoriating conniving journalists, newspaper editors and the political/media machinery of Chicago.At the heart of this criss-crossing satire is a character called Earl Williams, scheduled to be publicly executed for the shooting (and killing) of a black police officer. Every subset of the city, the film goes on to show, wants Williams executed for different reasons, the Mayor chasing African American votes, and the news desks itching for good ink. Their detachment is chilling; death reduced to filling column spaces. No better is Hildy's desire to twist Williams' story into a weapon to be used against the Mayor's local policies. Make Williams a scapegoat and damn the Mayor, she thinks.By the film's end, Williams has became a pawn in an ugly chess game in which everyone is wrong. Meanwhile, the news desks, politicians and police are all busy over-pyschoanalysing Williams. Each group hires "experts" to offer "expert opinions" on Williams' motivations. These "experts" are geared not toward finding the truth, but creating rationalizations, and therefore ammunition, for already held opinions, plans or policies.Hawks' films have always been amoral, dark and cynical, but "His Girl Friday" is particularly bleak. It's a film filled with sharks, leaches and back-stabbers, though a century of cynical films about newspaper men have rendered its satire impotent (even the cutting edge "The Wire", in its final season, can't get away from these clichés). Likewise, modern viewers may find Hawks' once novel screwball antics somewhat dulled by a diet of TV sitcoms. Aesthetically the film is typical of Hawks, packed with rapid-fire banter, overlapping dialogue, virtually no dead air and snappy, fluid camera work. Hawks captures the energy and buzz of newsrooms. His film spits like a machine gun.Incidentally, upon release "Friday" was praised for "promoting" social change. Namely that of marriages being based on equality rather than exploitation, the notion that women might be economically independent, intelligent and self sufficient, and that new possibilities lay ahead in the roles of the sexes. In reality, however, the film boils down to rigid, old, gender roles. Men operate in a sphere of violence and corruption, a stance Hildy must herself adopt - her price of admission into their all-male world - in order to escape the world of female entrapment and domesticity. This domesticity, Hildy then decides, is not worth the effort leaving. In other words: play the game, be a ruthless man, or shut up and stay at home.8/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am mystified by the 8.2 rating this movie has here at imdb. Perhaps only its fans have voted.The machine-gun dialogue would be fun for stretches, but when it spews non-stop for an hour, it becomes VERY annoying. And that leaves another half hour to go.Hildy's "dream" of giving up being a top reporter/writer to become a housewife to a dullard is STUPID. And completely unbelievable as presented here.Cary Grant's character is AWFUL, and when Hildy makes her inevitable (in a romantic comedy) end choice, it makes NO SENSE WHATSOEVER. Nothing is shown to indicate even the tiniest reason for her to change her mind about a finalized DIVORCE. Cary Grant is completely and criminally unsympathetic, and that is bad news for the lead in a romantic comedy.Tone problems. It's a comedy with dramatic moments that aren't the least bit funny. The suicide attempt. The gallows shots. Every word that comes out of the killer's mouth. And his dialogue is perhaps the worst I've ever heard for a "disturbed" killer in a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny But Cold-Hearted Screwball Classic Of Ace Reporter Girl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hildy Johnson is an ace reporter who has decided to throw in the sleazy newspaper game for a decent life. But when she comes to break the news to Walter Burns, her boss and ex-husband, he manages to drag her back into a fast-breaking story.If you like fast dialogue, this is the movie for you. The actors speak so fast you'll wonder if it's physiologically possible to do so. Based on Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's hit play The Front Page, it's an incredibly cynical but extremely funny story. Nobody is very interested in Williams the killer or the details of his crime, only in its context as relates to them. The reporters want a scoop, the Mayor and Chief want the black vote, the Governor wants to be popular, the girlfriend wants to be noticed, Hildy wants the rush from beating out everyone else. From my viewpoint it's a stinging indictment of newshounds (and as relevant as ever today) but Hawks was a pragmatist and he plays it as a nutty comedy as everyone scrambles over everyone else fishing for the best angle. Screwball comedies of sexual dynamics and goofy situations were big in the late thirties and early forties, with films like It Happened One Night, Bringing Up Baby or The Philadelphia Story, and stars like Grant, Katharine Hepburn and Carole Lombard made their reputations with them. If they have one major attraction, it's the leading ladies' potential to let rip and Russell does not disappoint, with a fantastic ear-chewing swaggering tour-de-force performance as she out-shouts and out-mugs a very funny Grant, a sort of acting equivalent of a headbanging hard rock guitar solo. Bellamy, as the hopelessly out-of-his-depth nice guy, heads a great support cast full of nutjobs (such as Billy Gilbert as the doofus delivering the pardon), all of whom are obviously having a whale of a time. And for me that's kind of the problem with this movie - they had so much of a blast making it, they didn't think what if the audience doesn't understand the plot and can't hear half the cracks. It's hilarious, but like Burns it's also so full of itself it doesn't know when to quit. Rhythm is key in movies and while ninety-miles-an-hour from start to finish is fun, for me it doesn't quite work. It's an unmissable classic though, if only to see Russell go at it and hear screenwriter Charles Lederer's crazy dialogue. There are several other film versions of this plot, notably the 1974 Billy Wilder straight adaptation of the play (in which the Hildy character is male), but this is the best and one of the sassiest comedies of its era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a 92 minute running time, this film has more than enough dialogue for a 3+ hour film. It's certainly emphasized here that screwball comedies focused on the conflict for women in deciding between love/marriage and professional careers. This film doesn't work for me on many different levels. While I can certainly appreciate extended dialogue, this film is overkill. The dialogue is absolutely blistering. It has many plot swings that are equally as painful, but the biggest reason I simply didn't enjoy this movie was because I just don't care whether or not Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell wind up together, largely because neither character is particularly likable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vastly overrated headache factory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently Howard Hawks must've assumed that Cary Grant could carry off even the most abrasive of lead roles. Sure, Grant specialized in snappy banter with a caustic touch, but it was usually balanced with self-deprication and an unrealistic modesty. Unfortunately, none of that humanity is present here, just endless, overlapping sniping, arguing and scheming, at ninety miles a minute. How anyone can muster any sympathy for Grant's character is beyond me. The crossfire dialogue is occasionally relieved by stretches of tedium. Rosalind Russell is charming and bright, and Ralph Bellamy does the best he can with what he's given. While there may be occasional touches of wit and good characterizations from the actors, His Girl Friday is one of the most irritating of Howard Hawks' films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing and pleasing second rendition based on the famous play from Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a classic adaptation titled ¨His Girl Friday ¨ 1940 , it makes some memorable exchanges from original play , perfectly directed by Howard Hawks including all-star-cast such as Gary Grant , Ralph Bellamy and Rosalind Russell with the pivotal character assigned to a woman instead a man ; dealing with a newspaper editor uses every trick in the book to keep his ace reporter ex-wife from remarrying . And being voted #10 in Total Film's 100 Greatest Movies Of All Time list . Very good recounting about known story in which a beautiful woman reporter (Rosalind Russell , though Katherine Hepburn ,Carole Lombard, Joan Crawford , Ginger Rogers, Claudette Colbert , Irene Dunne turned down the character and whose role was based on the real-life a notorious reporter) wants to marry a young (Ralph Bellamy) but his mean editor (sympathetic and charming Gary Grant) impedes it . Rip-roaring vintage newspaper slapstick comedy and subsequently remade by Billy Wilder titled ¨The Front Page¨; this 1940 retelling is the best one titled ¨His girl friend¨ and with awesome acting from everyone . Cynical editor named Walter Burns (Gary Grant) wants to get a big scoop on an execution which involves convincing star reporter Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell who resented the fact that she wasn't the first choice to play Hildy for director and she then showed up to the audition with her hair wet from swimming) to come back to work and put off her marriage to handsome executive . Walter tries to keep him in town and break up her upcoming marriage takes place against the backdrop of a botched death row . Hildy can't resist covering some good news , even when it mean helping a condemned man (John Qualen) getaway the law as she attempts to help an innocent man is about to be executed . And the escaped convicted murderer offers the journalist an exclusive interview . Other reporters also give hilarious acting in this breathless pursuit of an exclusive with the escaped death row inmate .Great cast gives powerful performances as Gary Grant as a scheming publisher , Rosalind Russell as a convincing as well as impulsive journalist and Ralph Bellamy as an incautious boyfriend . Enjoyable play and screenplay from Ben Hecht , Charles MacArthur about a cunning managing editor of a known newspaper and his ambitious reporter . The journalists are all based on actual reporters who were Chicago colleagues of authors Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, with most working alongside them at the courthouse ; the real names were only slightly changed . Ben Hetch's brilliantly tart dialogue overlaps story to carry the black farce along the roller-coasted speed . Agreeable performance from attractive Rosalind Russell as ace journalist who wants to quit the business and get married , though Jean Arthur, the first choice by studio head Harry Cohn, turned down the role of Hildy Johnson because she and Howard Hawks had been cool to each other during the filming of Only angels have wings (1939) the year before . Likable Gary Grant as an editor who finds out his main reporter wants to leave him and gets in the way , though many critics in 1940 felt that Cary Grant was badly miscast as Walter Burns, and that Clark Gable would have been much better in the part . Inventive and furious screen combats in which Gary Grant and Rosalind Russell are given equal footing with staccato dialog and sparkling interpretations . Phenomenal playing from everyone , including a top-notch secondary cast such as Gene Lockhart , Porter Hall , Cliff Edwards , Regis Toomey , Abner Biberman , John Qualen and Helen Mack . Adequate photography by cinematographer Joseph Walker , being necessary an right remastering because of the film copy is worn-out and suffers the public domain . The only music is in the first and last two minutes of the film . Stunning direction by Howard Hawks renders more funny than usual , and achieved success enough . Rating : 7,5/10 . Worthwhile watching and premiere voted this movie as one of "The 50 Greatest Comedies Of All Time" in 2006. Other versions about this this frequent-told story are the followings : The play "The Front Page" opened at the Times Square Theater on August 14, 1929, and ran for 276 performances . As Osgood Perkins , Anthony Perkins's father , created the role of Walter Burns on the Broadway stage . And "Academy Award Theater" broadcast a 30 minute radio adaptation of the movie on June 22, 1946 with Adolphe Menjou and Pat O'Brien reprising their film roles . The ancient rendition filmed in 1931 titled ¨The Front Page¨ by Lewis Milestone with big cast as Adolph Menjou , Edward Everett Horton , Mae Clark and Pat O'Brien in his film debut ; and do't miss this stunning adaptation ¨The front page¨ by the great Billy Wilder with Jack Lemmon as journalist , Walter Matthaw as managing editor and Carol Burnett . And 1988 new recounting , a modernized fourth remake titled ¨Switching Channels¨ in which an attractive TV anchorwoman wants to marry tycoon but his mean ex-husband impedes it , starred by Burt Reynolds , Kathleen Turner and Christopher Reeve , being directed by Ted Kotcheff .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful and witty at warp speed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>His Girl Friday has long been one of my favourite films ? a frantic and frenetic hour and a half of in turns nasty cynicism and corny schmaltz and almost endless talking. I haven't seen the 1931 Front Page for over 30 years now but I can't remember it being anywhere near as good as this, even with the standard snappy Warners newspaper delivery. I hadn't seen this for about 10 years until tonight but remembered all the peppy back-chat perfectly ? the effect a truly Great film has on me.Feisty female journalist Hildy Johnson refreshingly played by Rosalind Russell is trying to leave town to go to Albany with her future staid husband, who looked like Ralph Bellamy, gets ambushed by her ex-husband/editor Walter Burns on the trail of a hot crime story and hammed up for all he was worth by Cary Grant. Over the course of the film we realise even if she doesn't that she still has the fire of investigative journalism in her blood, so the outcome should be pretty obvious to all. The dialogue is breakneck, witty, cynical, and clever. Would it be remade now with everyone feverishly texting or bellowing into their mobiles? Favourite bits: the marvellous opening 14 minute section story-setting interchange in the Tribune's offices between Russell and Grant ? a masterclass; Bellamy's face at the police station reporting he'd been accused of "mashing"; the peremptory treatment by Louis of Mother in the press-room; so many others it's impossible to separate all the quick-fire one-liners. Two slight downers though: usually nice guy John Qualen hiding in the bureaux (surely not it's intended production for use?) slowed it down and introduced a clownish element to the proceedings; also the film's treatment of him and his problems seemed as cavalier and callous as was the newspapermen's ? literally no one except Mollie cared. Mayor Kolb &amp; Sheriff Lockhart actively promoting his murder was laughed off. I never knew why Hugh Herbert's face had been drawn on the wall above the bureaux ? by a really bored newspaperman I suppose.The film takes no sides on the utter cynicism and corruption shown and it also helps me realise that phone hacking for information by journalists must have been standard practice for decades by now. A fantastic production for use, showing how good olde Hollywood could be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, I expected this movie to be different from how it was. The beginning started out well, I was interesting and I was following it. Then it went into another direction entirely. Suddenly there were a dozen characters and I could barely keep up with names or who was who. The entire movie seemed to just be people shouting over the top of everyone else, so I could barely understand information and sort it out in my mind. It probably didn't help anything that even though I was in a quiet area with my volume up, the sound in the copy of the movie I saw was very low. Another thing was the way jokes were peppered into the conversation, but the characters were speaking a mile a minute. So really, I was only able to get the real gist of the plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This fast paced whirlwind comedy is unforgettable. Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell steal the show. The story revolves around Russell's character Hildy Johnson who has divorced Grant's character Walter Burns, and is set on leaving him and their fast paced lives as newspaper reporters in her rearview mirror. Burns doesn't want to let Hildy go and pulls every trick he has out of his hat to keep her from getting remarried. All of this is taking place the day before the controversial execution of an innocent man. The fast paced dialogue is non stop in this film with the newsroom, and press room at city hall serving as perfect backdrops. The script is tailored perfectly to show off Cary Grant's charm and presence, as well as Rosalind Russells perfect amount of sass and vulnerability. As the film advances and the stakes get higher in the storyline the characters and actors are all at their very best. Grant's swagger and Russell's ability to steal every scene make this one of the best comedy/caper movies I have ever seen.</fullReview>

As a divorced couple, they are just fabulous as he tries to prevent her at any cost from remarrying so that she can continue to be his ace reporter on his newspaper staff.As always, when Ralph Bellamy wasn't playing FDR, he portrays the guy who never can quite get the girl by any film's end. This picture is no exception.We see cronyism, nepotism and corruption in city government. Grant and Russell are superb because of their comic timing and their delivery. They go at each other with sarcastic wit, charm and that's what you would expect from a recently divorced couple who should never have untied the knot to begin with.</fullReview>

Like all screwball comedies, this film relies on witty dialog and sarcasm, but I have never seen it pulled off so fluidly and quick as this. Whereas some screwball comedies rely on making social critiques to give their films an edge, such as "My Man Godfrey", "His Girl Friday" wins the audience with top notch comedy and wit. The setting of a newspaper publisher is perfect for the frantic speed and tone of the whole movie, and the relationship between Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell is all the film needs to drive it forward and is premise everyone can relate to. This is by far my favorite screwball comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chemistry is enjoyable, while actual story lags</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before viewing "His Girl Friday" (1940) I was unaware that it was known for its "rabid-fire dialogue" between Grant and Russell but that is what I ended up noticing and enjoying the most. The story is not exactly and ingenious one, so it is really the charisma and obvious chemistry between the two leads that makes it run smoothly, and what made it a worthwhile viewing. My only true qualm with the movie, besides its rather dull story line was that Grant's character remains pretty one-dimensional. Right to the end he remains the hard yet charming "newspaperman" dedicated to a story over everything else. While the Russell's character does a 180 from a strong female lead, to one ready to fall into the arms of her obnoxious ex-husband; who in all honesty has done nothing to actually earn her affections.</fullReview>

I had to think long and hard before I realized what it was: I've seen this movie... and only maybe a month or two ago!For the life of me, I could hardly remember the film. I mostly recall that I watched it late one night when, I think, my wife and kids were visiting relatives out of town. It was only as I read through the reviews and descriptions of others that the details began to come back.Now when you remember the context in which you watched a movie better than you remember the movie itself, that's UN-memorable. And that's how unmemorable this movie is. I also remember that I felt a bit sorry for the murderer in the film. He was a pathetic character, but the director's only interest in him was for a gag. The whole thing just didn't compute. Still doesn't.Life has its mysteries. This movie's rank of 23rd best comedy ever is one of them. Still, there are much worse films.

		<fullReview>I always thought that most viewers would agree that His Girl Friday was not only a very funny film, but one that made some serious comments on the faulty U.S. justice system, lax prison administration and the prevalence of a "jobs for the boys" philosophy in all governmental undertakings including courts and prisons. Newspapers get a good drubbing too. In fact, the movie proposes that there is not a single newspaper in the whole country that you could trust to tell the truth. Deception rules the day right down from the publisher's office, through the editor's re-write department and then right down to the unprincipled reporters themselves. Directed at a furiously fast pace by Howard Hawks, His Girl Friday is an absolute must-see movie not only for fans of its stars (Rosalind Russell is absolutely perfect) but particularly for those who enjoy the work of the minor characters such as John Qualen and Helen Mack, Roscoe Karns and Clarence Kolb, Gene Lockhart and Abner Biberman.

		<shortDescription>Hold the front page</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen several of the remakes but I only recently viewed the original adaptation of the stage play, The Front Page.Howard Hawks has directed the classic fast talking screwball comedy which has serious political undertones that ranges from police incompetence and corruption, political corruption, the role of women in society and ethics of journalism.Walter (Cary Grant) is the ruthless, cynical, quick witted newspaper editor. His ace reporter is also his ex wife, Hildy (Rosalind Russell) who has turned up with her new intended Bruce (Ralph Bellamy) a lowly, kindhearted but a bit of a doofus insurance salesman from Albany. Hildy wants to settle down as a housewife away from the rat race of journalism.Walter does not want to let her go either professionally or privately and resorts to all sorts of chicanery to stop her from leaving with Bruce. However a prisoner in death row could be just the story that pulls back Hildy to cover one last big story.The film is daring for its time with its political overtones, the newspaper which Walter edits is Democrat leaning, anti capital punishment and dislikes the Republican Mayor and Governor widely hinted as being crooked and holding back the city.The film is also self deprecating, when Walter is asked to describe Bruce, he replies a bit like Ralph Bellamy! Walter also mentions that incident involving Archie Leach.The film goes at a cracking place and stays that way, it gets convoluted as the prisoner from death row escapes and Hildy's life gets increasing frantic as Bruce keeps getting arrested for incidents set up by Walter.Cary Grant does well to make the conniving Walter almost likable but and charming you do think that the man is as corrupt and self serving as the Mayor, Governor and the police chief he so despises.Hildy on the other hand is a born and bred journalist mixing it in the tough male dominated world (the so called 'wage slaves') of crime journalism and scoops. You do wonder what she exactly sees in Bruce and why does she want a quiet life?The film hangs well over seven decades later and is rightly regarded as a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really funny, but underneath lies a dark movie.Everybody loves how deliciously FAST this movie is. The plot head-snaps in every scene. Wit and pacing are tops, particularly when they are on the phone, two different conversations going at once. But the best parts are when it slows down and stops. Such as when Walter (Cary Grant) admits to Hildy (Rosalind Russell) that she "took the wind out of my sails" -- that never happens! Or when Hildy says "nevermind..." and just leaves it there.Hildy owns this show; Rosalind Russell upstages Cary Grant, likely the only time that occurred in any of his movies. She says intensely biting things about journalists -- basically that they are nobody's friend. At one point she demonstrates this to a room full of them, and they are caught speechless. Yet the excitement of getting the next story is something she cannot deny.Kudos to the supporting players. The speed of the dialogue would be insufferable without the slow-talking straight man Bruce (Ralph Belamy) and "innocent" hapless murderer (Porter Hall), who wait their turn to speak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Traditional guy, but not traditional woman.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts with Hildy walking into the press room looking very confidence. She asks the secretary where the boss (her ex-husband) is, once the secretary said do you want me to get him for you, she said no, I'll let him know myself. So right from the beginning of the film you get that this woman is in charge. Also having a female protagonist, itself was rare for the times. Statistically is rare now days also. But not as bad as before. As she was about to go meet with her ex-husband, Bruce, her now romantic lover offered his protection to her if things get rough. But she down played it by saying "oh? I'll come running". As if she is a damsel in distress. But this was in a sarcastic way and the audience gets it right away. Once she gets to meet with her ex-husband, we quickly find out that she was the one who divorced him. Yet another indicator that she is the decision maker in the relationship. And later at the lunch scene we find out that the reason for her leaving him was probably because he slapped her. Thus the reason she chooses to end the relationship. After that the first incident or luck as one might put it, took place. Sweeney (a writer at the press room) was having a baby and this caused Walter (ex-husband) and the head of the new paper, to ask Hildy to stay and do the story for him. This is when we finally find out, why Hildy is there. This is the most important part in the movie, because Hildy is there with an agenda as we find out later in the film. Her decision to let Walter know that she is engaged, about to get married and leaving town tomorrow, sets in motions the events that follow. Once we put one and two together based on her actions towards Walter and Bruce, we quickly find out that she is trying to get Walter jealous. She still has feeling for Walter, but Walter is not the guy she can trust. Thus she uses Bruce, a well-rounded gentleman, to pull the strings and play with Walter's emotion. So as you can see, Hildy is in charge during the entire film based on her calculated decisions. A couple of seen that come to mind that was empowering for women were; when Hildy was being referred to as "newspaper man" meaning she is as good as any men or equal. When Hildy walked into a press-room with guys playing poker and calling them ladies and telling one of the guys that he could be her bridesmaid. And finally the scene where she tackled the guy to the ground. These were very empowering scenes considering the times. The character development in the film is also interesting. Hildy wants a traditional guy but she is not a traditional woman herself, nor is Walter. Thus at the end of the movie she finally goes to the honeymoon that she never had, but with some compromises.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the Hawks goes habitually a little too far. His goal is to make chaos. However, it turns out that in the "slop" people enjoy. HIS GIRL Friday, the romantic screwball comedy based on the revised script and great dialogue. What first strikes the eye is the explosion of conversation. Improvisation is obvious, especially in areas in which characters fall into each other's word. Hawks played wisely and the result is more than good.In addition to the dynamic directing and economical narrative, the most important features of this masterpiece are fast and extremely witty replicas among picturesque and perfectly molded figures.Cary Grant as Walter Burns is executive editor of the Chicago tabloid, talkative, slightly broken and sleek man, followed by a failed marriage. Of course, Grant's ex-husband and was again excellent. Tired of it or not, he is in the role of ex-husbands excellent. Despite the fact that Rosalind Russell reluctantly accepted the role, just after this role will remain unknown. Attractive and energetic reporter Hildy Johnson. Ralph Bellamy as Bruce Baldwin is quiet and withdrawn fiancé and "good chance" with which every little undercutting farce. With the advent of the bridegroom mother's things become hilarious.This is a crazy press comedy, full of plot and excitement. The rapid pace, direction in which the story goes, and excellent acting are refreshing.</fullReview>

Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell were perfect for their roles as Walter Burns and Hildy Johnson, respectively, and Ralph Bellamy is great as the dimwit Bruce Baldwin who rivals Grant's character in his search for Hildy's affections. What really made this movie stand out was its fast-paced dialogue and action, which the fantastic cast pulled off perfectly. The dialogue was so fast that the characters often spoke over each other. This was a fantastic choice by director Howard Hawks that is reflective of the ever-changing newsroom environment to which Hildy and Walter belong. The fast and well-written dialogue also makes the film a great slapstick comedy; Grant and Russell are able to deliver lines quickly but hilariously. This movie is a must see for anyone who loves slapstick comedy, and one that I thoroughly enjoyed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This screwball comedy by Howard Hawks is mixed with slapstick comedy. This isn't my favorite old comedy movie but still kept my attention and was pretty humorous. This comedy is very fast paced and I thought it was hard to keep up with it at points throughout the movie. Cary Grant (Walter Burns) and Rosalind Russell (Hildy Johnson) do make a great pair in this movie as rival reporters. Rosalind Russel never loses drive and keeps up with the other reporters who are mostly men. She is funny throughout and my favorite scene involving her was when she tackled the man when she was running down the street. Overall I wouldn't give it an 8/10 but a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"His girl Friday" gets a Sunday review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1940 "His girl Friday" (Howard Hawks) is so fun to watch. its fast paced, witty dialogue is incredibly amusing and fuels the development of our two protagonists Hildy(Rosalind Russell) and Mr. burns(Cary grant). two of which are wildly funny especially while bickering and following each others antics. Rivals or partners with Hildy and Walter its very hard to tell and might as well be both. they take there work and each other very personally which I believe is what caused many of the issues which transpired through out the film and made for a suspenseful story line. this film must of influenced the paper business for years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a fast paced film that gave you exactly what you would expect from a screwball comedy. Cary Grant gave a great performance, the casting overall was spot on. The film was dialogue heavy, but that's what added to the fast paced action and comedy. The plot was entertaining as we get to see Russell's character get swept back into the environment she is trying to abandon. It's an interesting take on a love story as well as domestic life versus life in the workforce. Although there were many of the stereotypes you would expect from the 1940s, it was refreshing to see a female character excel in her field of work. This film is definitely what I think of when I hear the words "screwball comedy", and would recommend it to anyone who wants to become familiar with the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many of the other films in it's genre, the label of "Screwball Comedy" very accurately describes the film and it's objectives. It is designed not necessarily to convey a serious message but to provide the viewers with an enjoyable viewing experience and maybe even make them laugh. In addition to making people laugh, this particular screwball comedy incorporates some of the classic love scenes and some makes the viewers nervous at some points for the safety of their favorite main characters. The cinematography in this film is definitely one of it's assets and really allows for the viewers to focus on the action that they are supposed to be instead of being distracted by other things that may be happening in a particular scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>His Girl Friday is a screw ball comedy in which the comedic elements draw on the protagonists attempt to keep his ex wife from ending up with a new man. The film's dialogue is quick and has a punchy element to it. This is interesting to me, as I am a stand up comic...and one piece of simple advice for delivery, given by Jerry Seinfeld, "loud and fast." He says this is 80% of funny. And this film utilizes this concept all dialogue makes you WANT to laugh. Though I must admit, some of the dialogue itself didn't necessarily translate over the times...though for some people it may have, it is a very subjective idea, humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>These screwball comedies continue to make me laugh. This makes my idea that absurdity is funny no matter what the time period is. The dialog between the two main characters is real quick which makes it more exciting. The pace makes you look back and forth between characters as they speak. When they are having the conversation in the office about divorce is just an amusing conversation. Then she calls him a stinker which made me laugh because I found it funny that that used to be an actual insult. I love how he continues to let doors fly in her face and when the main character is going to me his ex-wife's new husband he assumes its the oldest man he can find. Movies like this are always enjoyable and this one in particular feels like more than just screw ball the fast paced talking is really well done and keeps you interested the entire film. I highly recommend this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, i am not very interested in old comedy movie, but for this one i think it's not bad. This comedy is one of those considered one of the best within the screwball department, and for good reason. The movie is all about Walter and Hildy, a divorced couple whose relationship really never worked out for them and now Hildy is going to get married again to man named Bruce Baldwin. In the file, the dialogue is lightning paced and flows quickly from one character to the next without a break in between. I wanna say this is a classic of madcap rom-coms, featuring some of the funniest, fastest dialogue ever written, and Cary Grant's performance is just genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought His Girl Friday was a romantic movie about a man trying to keep his ex-wife to stay at the job that they're working at together and also attempting to make her get back together with him. They divorce because he wanted her to become always work and stay the hard worker that she is and that isn't something that she wanted. After discovering that she is engaged to someone else, he does everything that he can to try to make her change her mind. I thought this was a romantic movie about a man trying very hard to put together something that he had lost not so long ago.

		<fullReview>A comedy with Grant, Rosalind Russell and Bellamy; Helen Mack and Toomey have supporting roles. It's rightly revered by some, and ignored by others, and both attitudes have their basis of truth, as I can understand there's something to be enjoyed, in terms of movie-making, and something to be ignored. Hawks could be very unpretentious about the dramatic quality of the scripts, and this modified Ben Hecht play is an instance.The movie is masterly, zestfully crafted, the scenes are genuinely funny; the plot is but a heartless, astringent satire by Ben Hecht. It's boulevard theater. The fact that, in terms of acting, I sided with the petty bourgeois played by Bellamy testifies to the script's efficiency. Hildy reminded me of Doug's wife from 'King of Queens'.The main characters haven't been written as a couple (the story of the cast is known), and are essentially cardboard; if the romantic screwball seems trite and uninspiring, it's because it never has been in the stage play, but was an improvement suggested by the actress. The play is a satire, with bourgeois wit, urban wit, and it's heartless and dry, unromantic, without any romance. The witty mercilessness isn't feigned; the empathy is. I have found the satire bombastic and pungent, and insincere, in the sense that the satirist belongs fully to the world he thrashes, and his awareness is cheap (and if it's meant to be socially conclusive, it comes across as hypocritically self-critical). Hecht's play belongs with other works of socialist novelists and satirists from the 1st half of the past century.I can see why some would shortlist Hawks' movie as one of the best (?) movies, while others wouldn't. For me, it was too unromantic, too heartless, too cheaply sarcastic (people are scum, let's laugh; but I did laugh at many scenes ?). The play is very dry. Dry not as in discretion, but as in crassness. Reporters are hyenas. Who cares whether the girl cares about the excitement of her job, or the streetwise ability of her manipulative boss, or both? This, like other comedies of that age, was the superior form of the mystery comedies.The satire as such is not only demoralizing, but useless and cheap. A satirist such as this has the right to care. He hasn't the right to be indignant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film. I liked how fast paced the entire film was, something was always happening. And even though we didn't necessarily see the action through our own eyes, we heard everything play by play from the reporters. I really liked how intense they made everything seem- like everything was life or death, no in-between. I also really enjoyed Hildy's character; her actions and her words totally contradicted each other but you could see it in her eyes where her true passion laid; the paper. Nothing could keep her from it, even her fiancé being in jail...she cared more about the paper than getting him out. And although that may seem selfish, it shows that maybe she wasn't as in love with him as she would like to believe. I also loved the interaction between Walter and Hildy...they had something special and it continued to carry over even after their divorce...things have a way of coming back to you if they are meant to be and I really liked taking that away from the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With this movie I wasn't sure what to expect from it. At first I thought that this was meant to be a romantic film where Cary Grant would try to win back the love of his ex wife. But I was so wrong. Instead, every scene is filled with comedy and then you realize that this isn't meant to be a serious film. The one thing that bothered me though is that the film seems like there is a very strong presence of gray colors. There are hardly ever any other colors but it seems that everything is just so bland. Plus another small thing that I was bothered by was the fact that dialogue would be spoken so quickly that you have a hard time understanding what was said. Either way, by the end of it the movie was better than what I expected. It's right on the same plain as any other screwball comedy. And if you have the time definitely check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was not much of a set in this movie. It was very simple and stayed with 3 main sets which kept it easy to follow. Even though this movie was made over 50 years ago, I still found the comedy to be funny, I caught myself laughing more than I thought I would. Howard Hawks used short and quick humor to his benefit. Cary Grant starred in this movie and he did a great job just like he always does; Rosalind Russell also did her part to make this film a classic. Both of them carried themselves in a recognizable comedic manner. A bit about the movie, Walter and Hildy are a divorced couple that can not work together. Walter wants to be back with her but she already has another man. Walter wants Hildy to work for her again and write a story on a murder case but she keeps denying him. This gets the two into a hilarious and entertaining pickle. I was very pleased by this movie and urge people to see it, This movie is a classic for a reason, to have people from all generations watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A screwball classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This comedy is one of those considered one of the best within the screwball department, and for good reason. The movie is all about Walter and Hildy, a divorced couple whose relationship really never worked out for them and now Hildy is going to get married again to man named Bruce Baldwin. Hildy used to work on the newspaper that Burns is editor of but has since realised the journalist's world is not for her and she wants to settle down in Albany with her new husband. Of course the plot never quite goes smoothly, Walter wants Hildy back on the job being his star reporter but she simply doesn't want to go back and not even a murder case where the accused may be innocent will tempt her back in when Walter first asks. The movie is a great mix of fast humour and wit, sarcasm but also just generally great characters and although some are pretty unlikeable, they are well acted throughout the movie.The two big stars of this are Cary Grant (Walter) and Rosalind Russell (Hildy) and they bring with them an expert class of acting that really makes this comedy come alive. The film even suffers slightly when we don't have say Grant in the picture for a little while, for me he is the stand out and some of the lines he is given are delivered with incredible style. The whole cast are pretty good to be fair too, Ralph Bellamy as Bruce is good and plays ever so well when the film see's Walter basically mocking the man without his knowing. The character of Earl Williams is very strangely funny, just his voice works to get most of the jokes out well and another character too Mr Pettibone adds to the speedy plot that never stops for breath.Howard Hawks brings the film in nice style to the screen and really brings the most out the actors at his disposal. It is Hawks who gets the film really going fast and also he that sets up this busy style film where everyone seems to rush in and out of a room in a split second. The adaption of the play "The Front Page" comes out funny on the big screen I mean this movie is never laugh out loud funny not really but it is the true intelligence of all involved that makes it really good. I think if anything stops it from being perfect then it is the fact that the middle and end can feel a little flimsy but all in all never breaks up, the actual end scene is very very fast and ends the movie is a way you probably won't be expecting.So His Girl Friday is just a real classic and one I couldn't recommend more to people, I know some will think they will not like it but I watched this twice in two days not because I loved it so much but because after the first viewing I knew I had missed many gags and knew it was better than I thought it was. Some could say this movie is also one of the very best in the careers of Grant and Russell, both give stunning performances so much so that after viewing this film and researching it I expected them to have taken some awards home for this but no. So anyway a screwball comedy that really makes you laugh but it is also really interesting as well, the kind of movie that if watched right, you won't take your eyes off it for a second.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Cary Grant Re-marriage Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always interesting to watch classic films that have a very different tone and feel to anything that comes out in today's world. His Girl Friday is very much a screwball comedy, and that genre in itself is a product of its time. It still holds up 70 some odd years later, but films just aren't made this way anymore. It's a fast talking and dialogue driven film about a man who is willing to do whatever it takes to keep his ex-wife and former reporter from marrying an insurance man.Cary Grant plays Walter Burns, the editor of the Morning Post., while Rosalind Russell plays his ex-wife and reporter Hildegard 'Hildy' Johnson. It's based on a play, but Howard Hawks, the director, made one bold but brilliant move by switching the sex of the Hildy character. I'm not sure how the play was written, but the dynamic between Hildy and Walter creates not only immensely funny moments, but also a relationship you root for in a film. Normally, it's not easy to root for a character who wishes to break up a soon- to-be marriage, but Grant brought a great sense vulnerability that proved to make it easier to feel for his character. It doesn't hurt that Cary Grant is one of the most charismatic actors of all time. What I found most impressive wasn't the acting or the notably funny script, it was the direction of Howard Hawks. I had seen a few of his films in the past including The Big Sleep and one of my favorite films of all time, Bringing up Baby, but it was his direction here that caught my attention the most. It's very difficult to keep an audience's attention without any real action or a ton of physical comedy like his other films, but Hawks uses these dialogue driven scenes in a way that doesn't feel overwhelming, instead, it proved to be very entertaining. I understand that the invention multi- track recording wasn't developed yet, so he told the sound mixing crew to turn the overhead microphones on and off throughout the film to create the final product. It's that dedication and attention to detail that makes Hawks one of the most celebrated filmmakers of all time.As I said before, this film is a product of its time in the way it's made. If you look at the editing for films that come out today, it's smoother and the cuts aren't usually very noticeable. In His Girl Friday, you can tell that the technology wasn't available for them to make each cut appear as seamless as they should be. It doesn't necessarily dampen the film's greatness, it's just a way of telling when it was made. In comparison to other comedies close to its release, such as The Philadelphia Story, another one of Grant's remarriage films, I think His Girl Friday has a much lighter tone. The sub- genre of screwball comedies known as the 'comedy of remarriage' has turned out some great entries like Holiday and Bringing up Baby. The ladder being far more like a Chaplin comedy than this film was in its humor. But His Girl Friday proves to be lighter, wittier, and probably aesthetically more important for its significance historically.The narrative focuses a lot on getting a 'scoop' as most of its main characters are writers of some sort. While newspapers are nowhere near as popular as they were during that time, I think the days of getting 'scoops' have returned. Whether it's breaking the latest in a political race, what the Kardashians have been up to, or dropping the latest scoop on the next superhero movie, the media is still obsessed with being first at something, except now it's on social media. So in a way, that's an argument against that His Girl Friday is a product of its time and more so proof that this film is important and should be taught today.The film is brilliant with its comedic timing. Whether it's the delayed reactions between each of the fast talking characters, or the insane and hectic phone conversations the writers are having throughout the picture, His Girl Friday has plenty of entertainment. You can definitely tell that it's based off of a play through the line delivery and its far-fetched plot, but everything works. It did a lot for films at the time as well. Hawks' big change from the play was the decision to make Hildy a woman. Not many films did something like that, if at all. Even today, you see far too little female roles on screen and His Girl Friday was one of the few films to change the story and add a female because it makes the plot far better. It's that type of progressive work that makes His Girl Friday a very important film then and now.+Grant is perfect+Witty+Phone conversations8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Easily one of my favorite screwball comedies I've seen. This film had me chuckling harder than I have at a screwball. The impressive part is that while being funny to watch, it depicted a rather serious question for women, be a housewife, or focus on your career? To be honest, this question is still around for some women. The fact that Hildy divorced her boss,Walter, was pretty laughable. While trying to win her back from her new infatuation with Bruce, who she claims she is going to marry, Walter tempts her with a big story on an execution of a murder...something he knew that she would struggle to turn down. The inner battle she faces is fun to follow along with. The attitude Walter has is identical to that of any big shot reporter, and it was easy to relate to people we know in his profession. Overall, the cast was well put together, nobody seemed out of character. This was very close to perfect as a screwball comedy could get. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys old comedies.</fullReview>

As smart as Hildy is, she let Walter walk all over her, when she walked all over Bruce. I guess that shows that Walter and Hildy are pretty alike. The film all in all didn't make much of an impression on me. I found myself getting bored a few times. However, it was not bad. I was interested to see what exactly Hildy would do, even though it was pretty easy to guess that she'd end up with Walter. It was also interesting to see where the "criminal" would end up, and I was not expecting the girl to throw herself out of a window.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A convincing, satirical comedy on the power of the press.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Howard Hawks, cinematic pioneer of screwball comedy and machine gun, rapid fire dialogue, created an enduring classic whose influence continues to be felt even today. This wasn't the first film to marry romance and newspapers, nor the last, with the likes of Capra and Cukor concocting their own tabloid funny pictures. But the play "Front Page" by Hecht and MacArthur came out years before, and Hawks's film superbly captures the atmospheric mania and chaos of paper journalism. The chatter of reporters relaying the big scoop into their telephones is handled brilliantly through complex, overlapping dialogue that was painstakingly captured by the sound mixing team. The romantic quips between ex husband and wife Walter Burns and Hilde Johnson (Grant and Russell) are entertaining enough, as is the subplot with her hapless fiancé, but it's the hysterics of seeing the characters holding conversations between, say, two candlestick phones and a coworker that provides the real physical and situational gags. You feel the urgency as an inmate is on death row for shooting a cop, only for him to escape, as the myriad of journalists all scramble for a story. The complex plot becomes even more intricately fast paced the further the characters become entangled in the escapades, as political intrigue, a love triangle, and a thrilling manhunt all conflict to create unbridled bedlam. At times it's easy to lose yourself in keeping track of the details but that becomes part of the film's charm; making sense of all the pandemonium is half the fun! But beneath the humour is a sardonic poke at the callous influence of the media, something that affects everyone from innocent bystanders to those who hold office. The story makes a darker subtlety about the manipulation of truth although the satire is softened by the romance inserted by the scriptwriters. Luckily this only means that the film has something to offer for everyone.It's a real pioneering work, and its impact on cinema can be felt all the way to contemporaries like Aaron Sorkin and Quentin Tarantino (of who the film is a personal favorite). Just be prepared to feel as the characters do; trying to catch onto the story amidst all the madness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>His Girl Friday (1940): Dir: Howard Hawks / Cast: Rosalind Russell, Cary Grant, Ralph Bellamy, Gene Lockhart, John Qualen: Amusing screwball comedy about the lifestyles we cannot pull ourselves away from. "His" points at either a newspaper tycoon played by Cary Grant or an insurance agent played by Ralph Bellamy with Rosalind Russell as Friday, Grant's ex-wife torn between the two. Hilarious situations follow where Grant creates obstacles that prevent the couple from making their train. Russell realizes that grant is the reason her fiancée has been arrested three times but she cannot turn down a big story of a cop shooting and a suspect on death row. Directed by Howard Hawks as a worthy followup to his hilarious Bringing Up Baby. The production is too stagy and the conclusion is somewhat sour when figuring one factor tampers with the affairs of another. Russell is terrific as a woman wanting to settle down yet motivated by her career. Grant is on target with fast talk and faster thinking. Bellamy is a great foil, bewildered as to the predicaments he is thrust within. Gene Lockhart plays an airhead Sheriff. John Qualen plays a convict up for murder and Friday is doing one last story on this individual. Qualen eventually escapes but turns up during the comedic climax. It regards direction and knowing oneself both personally and professionally. Not that there are any professionals here. Score: 6 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>His Girl Friday was released in 1940 and was directed by Howard Hawks. Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell have great chemistry on screen and do a fantastic job at making the crazy relationship between Walter Burns and Hildy Johnson a reality. The fast pace of the film makes the hour and half fly by, although the insanity between Burns and Johnson does get a little tiring after a while. It becomes obvious after a short period of time Johnson divorced Burns, but his antics makes him a lovable fool. The script writing is fantastic! The jokes range from witty puns to very clever political cracks. The costume design was good. The only notable costume pieces were Burns' suits and Johnsons hats. Overall the film is a successful screwball comedy, but I could have done with less shouting and people talking over the top of each other. It made the film difficult to understand at times and took away from the films quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Howard Hanks, director of His Girl Friday created this wonderfully funny screwball comedy that would be one to watch. The different plot used to create this movie was wonderfully genius. No movie is like this one, with regard to how it was set up. They typical comedic genius behind the script that made it entertaining to all audiences. The unlikely duo of a newspaper editor with his ex-wife calls for some hilarious goofs that make for an entertaining light-hearted watch. Although there is not any real underlying content to this movie, the movie itself is still entertaining and enjoyable. As for the actors Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, their on-screen chemistry is what really brings the whole film together. No other actors could play this role as effortlessly and wittily as these two have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of two reporters who recently divorced come together again as the story of a death row prisoner unfolds. Hildy, played by Rosalind Russell arrives to tell her ex husband Walter, played by Cary Grant that she is done with the newspaper business and is getting re married. Desperate to keep Hildy around Walter invites her and her fiancé Bruce out to lunch. Through the manipulative touch of Walter, Hildy begs to interview the prisoner who shot a "colored" police officer who was trying to calm him down, in the hopes of getting him a reprieve from the governor. Bruce reluctantly agrees since they were scheduled to take the afternoon train to Albany, along with his mother and he gives Hildy all their money. Hildy bribes the guard to let her talk to the prisoner, Earl Williams, who is scheduled to hang the next morning. During the interview Hildy discovers that Williams shot the police officer because he had just listened to a soap box speaker talking about "production for use". He said he had never had a gun in his hand before and that was the reason he shot the cop. Hildy returns to the press room to type up her interview when Bruce calls to say he is in jail. He's been set up by the ever clever Walter. Hildy bails out Bruce and leaves him waiting in a cab while she returns to the press room where her story is being ridiculed by the reporters who are there. She tears up the story, calls Walter and tells him she's leaving "in twenty minutes" and he can forget about the story. As she's getting her coat on gun shots ring out, all hell breaks lose and Hildy finds out that the prisoner has escaped. She forgets about leaving, calls Walter and promises him an exclusive for $450 which she wants right away. Meanwhile, Walter gets Bruce arrested again, this time for consorting with a prostitute. Hildy needs the $450 to bail Bruce out and Walter's henchman, Diamond shows up and hands her $450 worth of counterfeit money (which gets Bruce in trouble again). After Diamond leaves, Earl Williams appears outside the press room window and Hildy hides him in the roll top desk. Walter shows up next and soon after all the press show up. Williams stays hidden in the desk until Walter raps on the desk and Williams bangs back. Finally, Hildy cannot refuse her love for the scoop or for Walter any longer and Bruce and his mother go back to Albany without her. Throughout the film, the characters are constantly talking over each other, Walter is cleverly manipulating the situation to keep Hildy in town, the Mayor and Sheriff should win awards for stupidity and Walter and Hildy's constant back and forth make for some great comic relief. Underlying all the humor however is the underlying decision that women of the 1940's were forced to make; home and family or a career. It was unheard of at the time for a woman to have both. Hildy chose her career which no doubt surprised many women of the time but it was a courageous decision that many women would have loved to make.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Screwball Comedy Starring Grant and Russell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At times the dialog moves so fast that it seems sped-up. I will have to see it on TCM next time, to check that out. The story is very simple. Cary Grant (Walter) is the newspaper editor and "His Girl Friday" just came back from Reno and got a "quikee" divorce from him. In the course of this story, he resorts to everything from pickpocketing to kidnapping to counterfeiting just to keep his ex-marriage alive. Rosalind (Hildy) is going to marry Bruce (Ralph Bellamy) the insurance salesman from Albany,NY and settle down to a quiet "housewife life", but you just know it's never going to happen. After the plot of the "crazy nervous gunman and his girl friend" takes off, the movie switches into high gear. The action and dialog is so fast-paced, it takes your breath away. Every cliché in the world is here: The blonde "bombshell", the sneaky assistant, the dishonest mayor and police commissioner, the obnoxious mother-in-law (to be). It all works perfectly. Thanks to a few cable channels for still running black and white movies. As old as I am, I have never seem most of these before. Cary Grant was a great comic actor, and I now own several of his 1940-1950 movies, all black and white. (It all started with "The Bishop's Wife" and "Bringing Up Baby".)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's so much fast-talking dialogue in this brilliant Howard Hawks movie that you almost need two sets of ears to keep up. There's plenty of plot too though as Hawks mixes his mastery of the screwball comedy with an escaped prisoner, newspaper machinations, political corruption and of course, a twisted, barbed love story into one heady, breathless mix.The film is famous for its overlapping dialogue and even when it's not it's delivered lightning fast demanding perfect timing from its lead actors in the main. Enter Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell as editor and top reporter, ex-husband and wife and on-going sparring partners, both happily on top form as they go at each other hammer and tongs before the inevitable conclusion is reached at the end of the film.Only when the humour takes in the character of the portly court messenger delivering the governor's pardon does the humour become weak and forced, otherwise it's pacey, racy and at times risqué especially when Grant is in full-flow as only he can. I loved the insertion of the in-joke on Ralph Bellamy and wonder if it was an improvisation which the director liked and kept in. I also picked up on references to a number of topical subjects such as the European War the US hadn't yet entered and the gangster-crime of the day, highlighted when Grant in a phone call to his paper rejects potential lead stories one-by- one, to make way for Hildy's scoop covering the condemned prisoner's break-out.Set-bound as it is, perhaps unwittingly betraying its theatrical originals, Hawks' fast-moving direction ensures the viewer's attention is held from start to finish and in Grant and Russell, he had the perfect actors to make his film fly.This is classic Golden Age Hollywood film-making of the top-rank and although other versions of this story have been made down the years, this has to be the definitive version, I'd wager.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film came out of the screwball era of Hollywood, therefore it is exactly that. I mean, what type of film can't be seen as funny when it involves a man who is trying to ruin the plans of his ex-wives marriage. Typically this type of plot line is seen with women being the executors of the evil plot to ruin the marriage of their ex, and I think that that is what makes this film work. Not to mention that it stars, Cary Grant,who is the Brad Pitt of his day. This film also works because of the casting of the main characters of Hildy and Walter: Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant respectively. Another thing that should be noted about this film, is that even though it was filmed in 1940, you would never know based upon the pace of the film.</fullReview>

Grant plays the role as newspaper editor Walter Burns who is trying to stop his ex-wife and former reporter Hildy Johnson(Russell) from getting re-married to insurance agent Bruce Baldwin. it was hilarious to watch how Burns consistently gets Baldwin arrested over and over again. I liked the scheme he used to try to keep Johnson from marrying Baldwin.This was definitely an entertaining film. I'm actually torn between the two screwball movies that I have watched so far, this one and that of the one we watched in class. I would definitely recommend both to others.</fullReview>

The women in this film spoke so fast barely letting the other finish there line. This was comically done well though , these women were spot on. this movie was packed with dialog because of how fast the actors were speaking.

		<fullReview>It honestly took me two weeks to watch this movie. For some odd reason I just could not get into it. I believe this was because the film stared off slow and when some of the scenes became hectic, it was just too much going on for me. There was so much chaos and I get it. I mean they are the press trying to get a story after all but it just seemed to be a little too much. But I did like the main character Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell). She had this presence about herself that was great. She could command a room when needed be. The film had surprising comedy, I didn't expect it to be as funny as it was. With the man hiding in the desk to the crazy amount of phone calls that left the press room, I thought it was funny at times. Cary Grant's character Walter Burns was such a jerk. He made it nearly impossible for Johnson to escape the paper man business and he did succeed. It was a sad ending to her and Bruce's relationship. It was interesting to see a character try to commit suicide I think it was the first time that I've seen something of that nature in a black &amp; white film...especially with the "code" being set in place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The comedy used in "His Girl Friday" still holds up today. Cary Grant's quick delivery and wit is a big reason that he's my favorite actor from this era. The way he delivers his lines so quickly while acknowledging everything that's happening in the room is masterful.Billy Gilbert's performance sort of steals the show in this film. While he's only on the screen for about five minutes, those five minutes are some of the funniest of the film. The way he looks at the other actors and how he lets everything go over is head is amazing. He really deserved more screen time in the film.The final scene of the film is great. Every actor in the film pops up in this scene. Once again Grant was a master. The way he talked on the phones really made one believe that he was having three conversations at the same time. The conversation he has with the woman on the phone is my favorite moment of the whole film. The comedic timing when he says "What did i say?" after she hangs up is gold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film His Girl Friday directed by Howard Hawks was not my favorite film. I thought that it dragged on and it was slower. I did not like the constant back and forth between the characters, and when there was multiple people talking at one time. This was verrrrry annoying to listen to and it made me not want to continue watching the movie. While watching the movie I felt like it seemed like it should have been a play. I feel like it was too constructed and a little too dramatic. Another aspect of the movie that I didn't like was the part when the prisoner ran away, came through the window, and held the reporter at gun point. I felt like this was way to staged, it did not feel real at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Newspaper editor Cary Grant learns that his ex-wife and star reporter Rosalind Russell is about to remarry and become a housewife. Not wanting to lose her, professionally or personally, Grant gives her a huge story he knows she can't resistA rare case of the remake being better than the original. In this case the original being The Front Page, a great movie in its own right. This is a classic from Howard Hawks with a terrific script and an exceptional cast. Sparkling chemistry between Grant and Russell. The comedy is perfectly timed and executed but there's more to this film than just being very funny. There's a smart script full of wonderful dialogue that seamlessly interweaves the dramatic with the comedic. Great acting, not just from the leads, but an excellent supporting cast that includes Ralph Bellamy, Gene Lockhart, Alma Kruger, Clarence Kolb, John Qualen, and many other fine actors. It's a timeless film from one of Hollywood's best directors. Easily my favorite Rosalind Russell movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fine comedy that's engaging and has some wonderful lines.Though most of the dialog revolves around the relationship or how this young man Walter Burns (Cary Grant) tries to woo his girlfriend Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) back, it makes a satire through the underlying journalism that's so very well embedded in the film. Howard Hawks who directed this was a great director who has made some fine movies, even great movies and this is a great movie.Interesting is the setup and it's a relationship between an editor and journalist, and how they converse. Now this journalist Hildy is engaged to her fiancé Bruce Baldwin (ralph Bellamy) and editor Walter wants her back. To be right, Hildy is the ex-wife of Walter. Noteworthy is the audio graph of the film, I have seen through this film that right in 1940 people were having such an overlapping tone and the conversations were so free flowing. The sound was so realistic that at times I was amazed considering that in 1940 there was such technology put into use. Hats off for this, to the makers and to Hawks specifically who got every note of the dialog pitch perfect. I am say that most of the dialog was mellifluous.Also admirable is the pace of the film, in 90 odd minutes, so much was happening in an editor's office. And each time I heard them speak, I was mostly smiling. It brings smiles to us, and that's what this very film did. Most of the time, I was happy and I love it coz it made me happy. The art direction, the cinematography just seem to be complementing the vision of the director, the expression and dialog of actor so well that I was struck to it in admiration. I so very wish that we make more such movies in Hollywood than some crap action and comedy pieces. If today's comedy is either sleazy or slapstick, this genre was called screwball comedy because a few balls of the audience were screwed by the laughter it brought out. It did not make me laugh out loud though but made so very happy. Thanks to Hawks for taking this up and making a fine film from a wonderful premise. The acting by each one is apt, in-fact the enunciation, the body language, the expression all are in sync with what is needed for the scene. And that's the hallmark of great director, who can extract some great performances. Hawks certainly did extract some memorable performances. I am going with 4/5 for this wonderful fine gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old news? Who Cares! His Girl Friday is still an interest dark screwball comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This just in--- I like this movie. Directed by Howard Hawks, the movie is most famous for its clever fast-track dialogue, inside jokes, dark humor, and crafty one-liners/comebacks. This was really unheard of, from most 1940s film industry that was still kinda unsure in people wanted to see talkies or silent films. Indeed, it's one of the first, if not the first, films to have characters talk over the lines of other characters, for a more realistic sound. Prior to this, movie characters completed their lines before the next lines were started. It's in a rapid fire machine gun talking. I find it astonishing that human beings can talk this fast! The movie had lot of spontaneity and ad-libbing, and you really do see it. Honestly, if you take away much of the dialogue, you only got like 10 minutes of footage. There were some scenes that went a little too long in the pacing department, but it seem like it went fast, most of the time. The movie is adaptation by Charles Lederer, Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur of the play The Front Page by Hecht and MacArthur. The major change in this version, introduced by Hawks, is that the role of Hildy Johnson now played by female actress, Rosalind Russell. When director Howard Hawks was planning to make the film, he was going to cast a man for the part. While auditioning actors, a female secretary would read the lines belonging to that man part. Hawks loved the words coming from a woman so much, they decided to rewrite the part for a woman. Honestly, it's great to see a women actor in a more commanding equal role. It's also nice to see women, outside of the roles that normally you find in films from the 1940s that portray them as housewife, young unwed-daughters, or rich socialite. Honestly, I think this is one of the first movies that portray a newswoman. It shows that women are just as good in, gathering up the news, in what was once deem as a male's club only profession. Rosalind Russell is just as good as her co-star, Cary Grant, as Walter Burn, her ex-husband and ex-business partner. She indeed pretty much, carry the second half of the film, despite being Hawk's last choice to play Hildy. Yes, she did had help writing clever dialogue, by her brother. Still, she gave one-hell of a performance. One of Rosalind Russell's many gifts as an accomplished actress was her ability to act by not only words but by using great body language and amazing facial expressions. You see it, here. Cary Grant is just charming and funny as Walter Burns. It's odd to hear that 1940s critics thought he was badly miscast as Walter and Clark Gable would made a better choice. In my opinion, I do believe that, if you put Cary Grant in this movie against Clark Gable in 1934's It Happen One Night, you can see Cary Grant channeling his inner Clark Gable impression. No matter, what. Cary Grant was great in the role. There was still a bit of things that he did that was a bit unlikeable, but for the most part, he seem right man to play the wise cracking, always get what he wants, Walter Burns. In all cases, the adaptation stay close to the basic outline: Hildy Johnson, reporter, wants to quit the business and get married. Walter Burns, editor, doesn't want to lose her star. In the background, there are a convicted man, a hangman's scaffold, a courthouse newsroom full of cynical reporters, and an incompetent and corrupt sheriff and mayor that needs to be reported on. There were a few other different, as Walter does everything he can to keep Hildy from leaving, including setting up Hildy's soon to be husband, Bruce Baldwin, (Ralph Bellamy) with trumped up charges to get arrested over and over again. I felt this was bit too crude. After all, Bruce wasn't a bad guy. Walter even got his henchman to kidnaps Hildy's stern mother-in-law-to-be (Alma Kruger), all for mashing. How wasn't that not illegal? The man is really going all dark in his attempts and manipulation to win her heart. It's a bit disturbing. It's also a bit upsetting how both character mistreat the characters of the murder trials to the point, that one of them jump out a window. The character plead with the newspapermen to tell the truth and help him is heart-wrenching, and they lied to her face. That's really crude for a comedy. They ain't human. I know; they're newspaper men. Another fault is that the movie has no conclusion. It was all for nothing. They still dealing with the same old problem that both reporters character dealt with in the beginning. Nothing is learn. Other minor complains is the lack of music. Since the producers fail to renew the film's copyright. The movie falls into public domain, meaning that virtually anyone could duplicate and sell a VHS/DVD copy of the film. Therefore, many of the versions of this film available on the market are severely or badly edited or of poor quality, having been duped from second- or third-generation copies of the film. You can probably find a copy on the internet. Good copies are out there. Even with the movie way over 70 years now. There are still things worth watching that you probably didn't notice before, like the short scene of "Stairway Sam". Even the Hayes office seem to not to notice that. If you can't find this movie, watch 1931 Lewis Milestone's film, and 1974's Billy Wilder's film, The Front Page. Both are good watch, as well. Overall: His Girl Friday is a great satire of political corruption, the callousness of the pressmen, and how cold the news media is. No wonder why this film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. It's that good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was actually quite funny, I think what made it so was the great personas that were displayed on screen. Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell did a great job together, their back and forth was so natural. The story itself was great too, especially how they managed to add so many little things to make the story more interesting. The time crunch that they had, the murder, Hildy and Walter's previous relationship, Hildy's impending marriage to another man. This is screwball at it's finest. Perhaps my favorite part was seeing Hildy kick her new beau to the curb when she realized he just wasn't as important to her. He was obviously not right for her and she was just using him to get over Walter. Walter's meddling ways were definitely an asset to the story and the comedy particularly when he was using them to mess up Hildy's plans to leave and sending her fiancée to jail several times in the process. Great story, great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The battle of the sexes takes on new meaning with this newspaper classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Utilizing one of the greatest screenplays ever written for a film, this update of "The Front Page" takes on a feminine twist as the male "Hildy" of the play becomes the ex-wife of fellow reporter Walter, quitting to go get married to the boring insurance salesman in Albany of all places. All Manhattan newspaper offices should be located between a jailhouse yard with a hanging platform right outside the window, with a schoolhouse appropriately placed on the other side. Just the thought of this sends off a ton of cynical laughs in the hard-brittle world of journalism which almost 90 years after the original play still remains as intense and biting as it did back in the late 1920's. Hildy is Rosalind Russell, the tough-talking journalist who has a true knack for getting the story, and her ex-husband Walter is the fast- talking Cary Grant. If you gave him a nickle for every scheme he succeeded in to either get a story or get a reporter to do what he wanted them to do, he could retire from the business. Here, he's not amused to find out that his wife is getting out of the business to settle down with the staid Ralph Bellamy. Grant gets on his high horse extremely fast in order to prevent the two from leaving town, and in one call, amusingly describes Bellamy's mild-mannered Bruce Baldwin as looking like a certain movie actor. Even more amusing is his first meeting with Russell's fiancée, whom he pretends to assume to be a very old man at their pending introduction.Every detail of this screenplay is A+++. The gentlemen of the press are all preparing for the upcoming execution of Earl Williams (a marvelous John Qualen), the pathetic out-of-work milquetoast who got a little too excited and accidentally killed a cop. Grant wants Russell to get Qualen's last interview, and through various means of manipulation, manages to succeed. This, he knows, will get Russell's journalistic juices flowing and will prevent her from leaving either his employ or as he hopes, his bedside. Veteran actress Helen Mack plays the tough-as-nails Mollie who showed off a heart of gold when she allowed Qualen into her room one night and did nothing but listen to him repeat his sob story to her. Now, she's got a reputation, and as the time for Qualen's execution approaches, wants to get her last word in with the reporters whom she accuses of manipulating the situation just to get a good story.While the story definitely has its tragic moments, there's a cynical edge of comedy here, and the writers are obviously utilizing this as an attack on the power of the press which is still often abused. Grant hysterically demands that that pesky war in Europe be taken off the front page for the newest developments in the Earl Williams case which is now a bed of a political battle between the local sheriff (Gene Lockhart), the mayor (Clarence Kolb) and the unseen governor. A veteran cast of famous character performers fill out the parts of the other reporters, from Porter Hall and Cliff Edwards, to Alma Kruger as Bellamy's outraged mother. Billy Gilbert is a riot as a messenger from the governor's office, and Marion Martin is fun as one of the elements of Grant's schemes against the engaged couple.So few films hit pure and absolute perfection, and "His Girl Friday" is one that comes out to be even better than its excellent original, filmed ten years before with an all-star cast equivalent to this one. Remakes of both versions (one updated to a television newsroom) weren't bad, but placid when compared to these two films. As social comedy with elements of drama and tragedy involved, this hasn't been beaten, even by Frank Capra at his finest. Grant and Russell are as outstanding a movie couple as there ever has been, and Bellamy, who has had his share of leads, has never been better here as he is as the mild-mannered clod who has no idea of what he's up against. The excellent direction by Howard Hawks helps keep everything together and he is aided by excellent work by the photography and editing team.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the Definitive Screwball Comedy, But Still Enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cary Grant is head of a newspaper business, and was previously married to Rosalind Russell, who now wants to leave her business job to marry nerdy Ralph Bellamy. Grant wants Russell to come back to him, and deliberately devises schemes to eliminate Bellamy from Russell during the most insane (and mostly false) news story in the history of news stories.The film has been described by many fans as "the definitive screwball comedy." But is it really? There's some really insane comedic moments in the film that make the film fun as it is, such as the brilliant chemistry between Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell and the insane, super fast talking used throughout the picture, but it's not a perfect film. I didn't care too much for the behind the scenes frame-up news story that plays a major part in a film. It just seemed too forced in what's supposed to be a comedy. Another scene where a character commits suicide also seems out of place in a comedy. But like with other flawed films, when Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are on screen together, sparks fly and the film's extremely fun to watch.It may not be the greatest screwball comedy ever made (I have a higher preference for Bringing Up Baby and You Can't Take it With You), but Howard Hawks delivers in making an enjoyable film nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed watching His Girl Friday. It was a great movie that I would watch again just for pleasure and not as a requirement for class. Also considered to be a screw ball comedy like My Man Godfrey, they were made 4 years apart and in the Golden Age of making movies and both were excellent not only as comedies but also just in the film sense. His Girl Friday was funny from start to finish, had comedy, betrayal, rekindling, drama and anything else you could think of happening in a movie. I thought the acting of Cary Grant was phenomenal in every way. He really made me want to continue to watch the movie and not miss anything. Even trying to be the bad guy he is a good guy and i really enjoyed watching his acting as well as Rosalind Russell. Both were superb. I would recommend this to everyone as a classic 1930's screwball comedy but also just as great movie that you can watch over and over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rosalind Russell dominates this film because she is in it all the way through, from fade in to final fade out. One wonders if leading man Cary Grant disappears for about twenty or twenty-five minutes in the middle, because it would put the picture over budget, or because he is busy swimming up in Malibu.I know a lot of people are bowled over by the rapid-fire dialogue (director Howard Hawks and his team are compressing a two hour movie into the space of ninety minutes); but the exchanges work between the main characters because their relationship is as believable as a story of this nature allows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Analysis for His Girl Friday (1940)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was a really good one, and it has been impressing people a lot since it was first released. It was funny, heartwarming, and really energetic at the same time. The film was so good that I found it interesting. When I first heard of comedies like this, it really got me getting into some laughs. I remember a lot of moments when Walter and Hildebrand (a.k.a. "Hildy") were together, and that was when I knew that something was going to happen. It really got me into laughing at a lot of what they do. It seems that people have been loving comedies, whether they're shows or movies, and people would want to see them again. It will keep saying, "Watch me again!" in my mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>His Girl Friday is a mix between a normal screwball comedy and an early form of romantic comedy, and it is one of the best ones I have seen. Right from the beginning the fast paced dialog draws you in, and you are determined to not miss a beat. There is a bunch of overlapping lines that give the film a realistic feel to the arguing that is going on. The one liners in this film are also gold. It is written so well and will keep you laughing the whole way through. The chemistry between the cast is also a key figure to the greatness of the film. They all seem to mix so well together, even during arguments, that it feels real. If you want to laugh, this is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast paced comedy satire screwball at its best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Hecht and Charles Mc Arthur's "tribute' to newspaper reporters working the police blotter was already a successful stage play and a sound film when director Howard Hawks decided to tinker with the story's basic recipe and substitute a female (Rosalind Russell) in the role of Hildy Johnson an ace reporter that plans to leave the game in order to get married much to the objection of editor and in another twist former husband Walter Burns (Cary Grant). Hawks gamble pays off in spades with as fine of an example of screwball comedy in film history to be found this side of Preston Sturgis.Cop killer Earl Williams is about to be executed but the governor is having second thoughts. Both the mayor and sheriff want him executed to improve their re-election bids. Hildy drops by the press room at the jail to bid fond farewell but Walter wants to keep her on the job as well as have second thoughts about leaving her so he concocts a plan to get her fiancé arrested repeatedly while he keeps Hildy on the job.In one of the truly great pairings in comedy film history Russell and Grant are sharp as tacks spitting benign venom at each other as Walter connives and pushes buttons to drive Hildy on to do her job and away from the arms of the haplessly perfect and put upon Ralph Bellamy as the fiancé.As a cynical Greek chorus (Roscoe Karns, Regis Toomey among others) the newsroom boys chip in another fine performance en masse as they wax acerbic Hecht and Mc Arthur's biting dialogue. Clarence Kolb as the mayor attempting to stay on point bribing an official with double talk is another highlight as well in a film that never stops to catch its breath as Hawks masterfully keeps the energy level high from start to finish smoothly intermingling both of Burns ulterior motives to make Hildy stay put while making wry commentary about political corruption and the death penalty. Few in film have re-tooled a proved winner and come up with a better version. Going from Front Page to Friday merely turned it into a film classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Verbal Machineguns in Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie reminds me of WWI, with machine-gun dialogue flying faster than proverbial bullets across a no-man's land. There're more lines crammed into a 30-second spot here than there are in most 2-hour movies. Thank goodness most of them are funny. My guess is Grant and Russell went home at night, took out their tongues, and massaged them. So, can editor Walter (Grant) rescue reporter Hildy (Russell) from entering a conventional life with the agreeably dull Bruce (Bellamy). Walter's doing his best, by fair means or foul, mostly foul. Poor Bruce, it's like he's trapped in a jail cell revolving door thanks to the endlessly conniving Walter. Then there's the luckless Williams (Qualen), headed for the hangman's noose, and sounding like a communist when spouting such suspicious slogans as "Production for use". Looks like it's either the gallows or spending the rest of his life locked up in a desk. No wonder reporters are flocking around like flies on a carcass.This is madcap at its maddest, and I would guess signature roles for both Grant and Russell. Their pairing here turned into a casting coup for director Hawks, who specialized in rapid- fire, overlapping dialogue. The lines themselves are from the stellar writing team of Lederer and Hecht, so the humor comes legitimately. All in all, the movie's a genuine classic. But my advice is that if you're hearing impaired like me, be alert to the verbal rounds as they fly by. It's worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedic Writing at its Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) marches into the newsroom to tell her ex-husband Walter Burns (Cary Grant) that she is quitting the paper and marrying a reliable, earnest, mild-mannered and relatively dull insurance salesman, Bruce (Ralph Bellamy) and moving to Albany to live a saner life. Walter still loves her and does not want to lose his best reporter, so he sets out to undermine her decision and keep her on staff.The real star of this film is the writing. Throughout most of His Girl Friday the dialogue moves along at breakneck page. Take a look at the first scene in Walter's office, where the ex-spouses are bantering back and forth. You have to wonder how long it took to get that one film. Great work by the two actors to remember those lines and spit them out so quickly while retaining the intent of the lines.This is a multi-layered comedy. Where most comedies employ only one or two elements of comedy, HGF layers many elements and achieves success with each. Note the use of physical comedy (as when Walter lifts his shorter minion high enough to look through the glass into his office). The script is filled with inside jokes, which are more fun if left to the viewer to discover. The dialogue moves so quickly that you might miss some of the wordplay, but even on first viewing you can pick up more than enough to dazzle. A running gag is the dueling phone conversations, displays of great timing and, probably, much rehearsal. Speaking of timing, certain scenes are classic farce.Through all the fun and games, HGF also manages to comment on some serious issues. The politicians and the journalists sometimes battle, but they both are shown to be unscrupulous and unconcerned with truth. Another reviewer called HGF a "tribute to journalists", but I say it excoriates the trade--depicted in this film as exponents of yellow journalism.A reviewer also said that it is difficult to imagine anyone else playing the leads in this film. I often feel that way about a film, but not in this case. When you read about all the actors who turned down the roles or who were passed over, I can imagine most of them playing these parts. Clark Gable as Walter? Absolutely. Ginger Rogers or Irene Dunn or Jean Arthur as Hildy? Sure. The writing is so good that it rises above the actors who inhabit these roles. That is not to say that I didn't appreciate Rosalind Russel's ability to play a believable reporter who hangs out with and competes with the boys. I like the way she uses her ambling walk when Hildy is in her reporter mode. And Cary Grant really captures the shrewdness of Walter--a man who can change strategies or personalities on a dime. He is the real salesman, not Bruce. In the scene were he treats Hildy and Bruce to lunch, try to imagine Grouch Marx in the role of Walter. The writing is so good, it can mold itself to the comedy stylings of many actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hilarious breakneck dialogue via Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant's genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are several reasons His Girl Friday is so brilliant ? so much funnier than any other version of the Ben Hecht / Charles MacArthur stage comedy "The Front Page" ? and has gone down in history as the smartest, funniest, fastest movie comedy of the forties.The story and plot are classic. By the climax, an accused criminal is hiding in a desk in the courthouse press room to avoid a hasty hanging, with a retiring reporter and her boss helping him. But this version offers so much more.There's Cary Grant. In any other version of The Front Page ? like the previous one with Adolph Menjou ? before long you're filling with contempt for scheming, unscrupulous, self-centered news publisher Walter Burns. But when Cary Grant plays Burns doing those same things, we cheer him and love him for it. The gender change for Hildy was key: it works so much better that Burns' unstated goal is to get back with his sharp-tongued, perfectly matched ex-wife - not just to scam his paper's best reporter into staying on. Grant lets us in on every motivation and joke - he practically winks at the camera when he cracks wise at Hildy's boyfriend Ralph Bellamy's expense, with zingers only his dear ex-wife will get.How could we like someone who pays a thug to rough up an old lady? Someone who flatters and even hires a rival paper's reporter, just to get control of his desk ? a minute later giving the order to "kick him down the stairs" when he reports for work? No other actor could get away with any of this, not remotely. In the last line of the movie there's Hildy, in love again and struggling to balance a suitcase over her head as they rush down the stairs. As Grant helpfully asks without breaking stride, "Why don't you carry that in your hand?" we forgive him one more time in exchange for that laugh.Even more important, there's Rosalind Russell ? not the character she plays ? the actress. Russell was so determined her Hildy must have as many great zingers as Grant's Walter Burns, she started quietly paying writers to add hilarious Hildy comebacks throughout every conversation. She delivers them without a breath or a pause, and ? impossibly ? without making the scene any longer. In other words, she interrupts and talks over Walter whenever she can and comes off as the sharpest wit in a story brimming with sarcastic reporters. When critics caught their breath, some credited director Howard Hawks with an innovation: uniquely naturalistic dialogue, with people talking over each other as they do in real life. This movie is full of genius from its writers - the acclaimed Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur were news reporters in the corrupt Chicago they depict, while Charles Lederer was known for making dialogue spark. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Howard Hawks directed this rapid-fire comedy that sees Cary Grant playing Chicago newspaper editor Walter Burns, who is desperately trying to prevent his ex-wife and ace reporter Hildy Johnson(played by Rosalind Russell) from marrying an insurance salesman(played by Ralph Bellamy). There is a big story involving an impending execution going on, and Walter wants Hildy to cover it, which makes a most convenient excuse to stop them getting married! Of course, complications ensue when the man about to be executed escapes... Well acted and witty film is reasonably funny, but does come close to being obnoxious at times, but lead characters are at least tolerable, and film breathlessly paced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rosalind Russell's character, rarity that it is, keeps the film from becoming a mechanical farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nearly no mainstream films, pitched as they are to the infamous "key demo" of young dudes and bros, have female leading roles one-tenth so funny and fully-realized as reporter Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell). She is "His Girl Friday," the focus of nearly every scene. Alone among the screwballs that populate this rather cynical comedy, she is someone real enough to like and to root for. Her ambitions and values reach beyond the immediate demands of the story, and her skills as a writer and investigator are compelling. Her ex-husband, who is also the editor of her paper, is funny because he's so perfectly passive-aggressive and because he is played by Cary Grant, master deliverer of cutting remarks. By himself, though, the character would make a poor protagonist. Hildy's current fiancé, hopelessly dense and dull, would be even worse. Only she can pull off the combination of physical comedy (running through traffic to tackle a source for a big scoop), rapid-fire barbs ("Now get this, you double-crossing chimpanzee. There ain't gonna be any interview and there ain't gonna be any story... I wouldn't cover the burning of Rome for you if they were just lighting it up"), and self-serving schemes (obstructing justice and manipulating suspects for the sake of a front-page byline) without losing the relatability that makes the movie more than mechanical farce.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid comedy and a terrific movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very pleasant surprise (and never boring), "His Girl Friday" is a movie with such a crackling script that you kinda feel dizzy at the end after keeping up with the lightning-quick dialogue. This is my first Cary Grant movie (never too late to start, right?), and his leading man hair and dimpled chin star power ably support his foray into such a screwball comedy. His character is so amoral that the guy's just ... he's damn likable. But the real star of this movie (at least, to me) is Rosalind Russell. I know nothing of the play on which this is based, but I wouldn't be surprised if her character was originally a man. She trades jabs with the other newsboys like a fellow man. But this is hardly a complaint; it makes Russell and her character a thrill to watch. She's the fulcrum on which the story pivots and it's heartening to see her go toe-to-toe with any other male character. Poor Ralph Bellamy's naive character has to play straight-man to the others' chicanery, but he's at least the beneficiary of one of the movie's best lines (and a bit of meta humor that directly references himself as an actor). What's really surprising is just how many laughs come from the supporting players. A fine movie, at that.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't realize how much I love screwball comedies until watching "My Man Godfrey" in film class, but then I couldn't wait to watch another (and more!). "His Girl Friday" was a great pick?I love Rosalind Russell and she gives such great life into Hildy's character. The fast pace of the entire flick kept my constant attention (and honestly felt like sitting around the table at holidays with family?everyone talking at once!). The subtle jokes could easily be missed if one wasn't paying attention, like the mention of Bellamy's character looking like "that guy from the movies, Bellamy." Ha! Of course Cary Grant is wonderful as ever in using his facial expressions to convey what he's really thinking for the audience even if other characters aren't meant to notice. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs an introduction into the genre.</fullReview>

I thought it wasn't a very strong story line and I got bored with it very easily. Maybe it just moved too fast for my taste but it was hard to follow and uninteresting. Though, Cary Grant is an amazing actor, I think he played his part very well in this film. I think for its time though, it was ambitious for the director to have a woman play such a role like this in a film. HIldy (the main female character) was one of the best writers at her former newspaper job, which is normally dominated by the male gender.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>breathless and magnificent comedy; one of Hawks's very best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The kind of work executed in His Girl Friday is no shorter than masterful; it should be a frenzy, a fiasco of dialog going and overlapping and reverberating and the pacing clocking in at ridiculous amounts at times (other times, oddly enough, it slows down just enough for us and the actors to catch respective breath). But Howard Hawks and his screenwriter Charles Lederer have the material down to a T. The film brilliantly interweaves a newspaper story that unfolds over the course of a day and night around a man who's to be (wrongfully) sentenced to death, and a love-triangle played out between Walter (Grant), Hildy (Russell) and Bruce (Bellamy), as Walter can't stand that his ex-wife is not only leaving the paper- which she's wildly amazing at as a writer and reporter- but for Albany insurance man Bruce Baldwin as new husband. He constructs an ingenious lot of tricks, mostly to put Bruce in jail, so that he can play on Hildy's ego to come back to the paper and, maybe, to him too. But it won't be easy.Hawks overcomes what could have been stagey picture- since it is based on a play, and feels it at times with its main set at the newspaper office- with what is first a true intuition to how to tell the story without getting in the way of a good conversation; sometimes going in three directions! It's not exactly a movie that brings out a whole lot of belly laughs; rather it's the accumulation of just solid chuckles, guffaws, and the occasional fall-on-the-floor moment that hit the best with characterization, behavior, mannerisms, manners. Matter of fact, it's extremely, keenly observed about how every character is who he/she is, and is fairly stuck in their ways, from the headstrong Hildy, the good but flabbergasted Bruce, his old mother, the "I'm innocent!" pleading man on death row, the Sheriff, the Mayor, the bunch of gruff and grizzled and card-playing newspaper men. But everyone's about as close to being, if not incredibly, fully realized, and there's barely a scene where someone doesn't say something, or repeat something, or refer or make some quip that doesn't get a laugh. This is how it's done, basically, in the best "screwball" style.Even Hildy, who seems to be completely set upon leaving the newspaper biz, isn't without moments of vulnerability that crack through her tough, Hawksian-exterior. And Russell, I should add, comes off a lot of the screen time stealing the show. While Grant is no sleepwalker and puts to work his skills at being charming and amusing while also playing a conniving persona, Russell puts everything she's got into a character that is probably far stronger than Bruce can take and is just about an even match for Walter Burns's double-crossing. Hell, she can even do a dramatic scene here or there, or make it so that she's right on the level with another actor (i.e. the one playing the death-row guy) so that comedy and drama come and go depending on the beat of the scene. It's breathtaking to watch her work, and it's likely her best performance (Grant, too, comes away with much of his screen time).Just make no mistake, this isn't a comedy that is based on the actors for most of the support. It's a wild combination of the pacing of the story, of the rat-tat-tat-tat style of overlapping and interweaving dialog (the likes of which one might see today on the TV show Gilmore Girls or, more cinematically, Altman) and that it never comes along as too rushed within the suspenseful narrative. And it floored me as being somewhat unique, and it only takes itself so much seriously in the world its set in so that it's always entertaining. If you're tuned into His Girl Friday, Hawks won't bore you for a second, and it's a mighty achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious re-make of "Front Page"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"His Girl Friday" is described in one newspaper review as "fast, fast, fast." That is an understatement. You have to see this one several times in order to get all the priceless dialogue, some of which overlaps, a phenomenon that hardly ever happens in movies from this era. Grant, Russell, and company are still funny sixty years later. This classic is one of the reasons I so often choose witty comedies over slapstick, ie, the Marx Brothers over Jerry Lewis.One of the little things I picked up on after repeated viewings is how Billy Gilbert, playing the guy with the governor's reprieve for Earl Williams, steals both scenes he is in. Gilbert can be seen in dozens of other movies in which he blows his stack, especially when he is working with Laurel and Hardy. Here, though, he hardly raises his voice at all, yet you watch his expressions when he is on screen with the other actors, and he becomes the center of attention without speaking a lot of dialogue.</fullReview>

I figured that with that many people rating it favorably, it was bound to be a good movie. Wrong again! I found it to be incredibly stupid and completely unfunny, plus the rapid-fire dialog where everybody constantly talks over everybody else was extremely annoying. The Cary Grant character was a very mean person. I saw right away that he was what I would describe as a certain word that they probably won't let me say here but it begins with an a. The Grant character was dishonest and manipulative, and he did bad things. In real life, I would have had nothing to do with a person like this. Yet he is the one that we are supposed to think of favorably. Why? What does he have to recommend him? Absolutely nothing. He is a first-class jerk. I saw reviews calling this movie "hilarious" and "incredibly funny." There was absolutely nothing funny about this movie, let alone hilarious. I guess some people think that a person doing mean things to an innocent person and trying to manipulate someone to do things to benefit him are hilarious. I happen to think that cruelty and injustice are not funny in the least. And things were done that made no sense. I couldn't understand why these people would do these things which in real life nobody would do. I watched the whole film, but I sure wish I hadn't wasted my life in so doing. Apparently there's no point in going by ratings. This movie got a higher rating than any other movie in the schedule, and yet it was awful. I watched several other movies rated around two points lower and enjoyed them a lot more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So where exactly were the jokes?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>His Girl Friday is a screwball "comedy" about a talented newspaper reported named Hildy Johnson trying to escape the newspaper business and her duplicitous taint of an ex-husband Walter Burns. Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant play our leading actors, and actually do a very good job. They move at a fast pace, turn their roles into unique feeling characters, and do, for the most part, have a good chemistry (until the very ending). The film is generally well acted all around, but this is where my praise of the film will be coming to a screeching halt. This film has left me fairly confused, and that confusion has turned into a chafing irritation the more I look back and contemplate what exactly I had watched. The root of my confusion stems from the genre this film is labeled under. According to everything I've seen this is a screwball comedy, but I don't understand how a film should qualify as a comedy just because we have an odd couple butting heads throughout what is in all other aspects a crime drama. Despite the way this relationship clashes with the narrative of the film, it does manage some good moments. About 1/3rd of the way into the film we follow Hildy as she covers the story of a man facing the death penalty for the of shooting a police officer. She visits the jail where he's being held to interview him through the bars of his cell in a way I found very reminiscent of the interview scenes in Capote. She meets with a women grief stricken over her friend's impending execution, and cleverly records her lamenting of the situation. This aspect of the film progresses in a very enjoyable way, and if it was separated from the sort of broken love triangle type deal we have to suffer through otherwise it would have been very good, but it deals a pretty devastating blow to the screwball comedy aspect of the film by becoming far too dark and dramatic. It ends in a suicide and the capture of the man accused, who will now certainly be facing an execution. How does this have any place in a comedy? It really doesn't at all. This brings us to the odd couple/screwball aspect of the film. The parts that really dragged this film into a deep, dark grave for me. This portion of the narrative centers around Hildy's impending marriage to an all around nice, trusting man named Bruce Baldwin, played by Ralph Bellamy. A guy that could very easily give Hildy exactly what she claims to really want out of life after her plan to leave reporting for good. Upon hearing of her engagement, Walter immediately starts scheming, lying, stealing, cheating, and tormenting his way into their lives in the hopes of splitting them up. He tells Hildy all about how much he wishes they could get re- married, but she quickly rebukes him with all of the many valid complaints she had about his treatment of her as his wife. Throughout the course of the film Walter ends up getting Bruce arrested and sent to jail on three separate occasions, and Hildy really has very little problem with all of this, and in the end, Hildy goes from being engaged to Bruce one minute to planning her re-marriage to Walter, her complete scumbag of an ex, the very next. This movie has to have one of the absolute worst, most ridiculous and completely forced endings I've ever seen. It sloppily ties (most) of the loose ends from the crime drama narrative together in a crusty meat sack of an abomination unto film in the very last two minutes, then has Hildy and Walter holding each other tenderly and planning their coming honeymoon only for it to devolve into exactly what caused them to divorce in the first place. I get that this is supposed to be outlandish and funny, but it is so completely straight out of left field and absurd that it just becomes insulting. Why would Hildy ever agree to this, let alone think it's a good idea? The world will never know. And how did I miss every single laugh in this film? Because they didn't exist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I seem to find myself coming under the "Yes, but..." camp on this one; yes, I enjoyed the film, but I didn't love it. Nor would it find a place in my personal pantheon of classics.Part of my problem is that Walter Burns is apparently intended to be secretly attractive by dint merely of being played by Cary Grant -- at least, he never does or says anything in the course of the screenplay that would otherwise give him any appeal. Burns will lie, cheat, double-cross and murder (at least, shrug off the supposed death of an old lady without a qualm) in order not merely to get a 'story' but simply to get his own way, and by the end of the film I was hoping for nothing so much as to see him get what was coming to him; no such luck. In the original "The Front Page" (which, like this, was good but not superlative), the no-holds-barred relationship between (male) Hildy and Burns made sense in the rougher male-bonding context; seemingly, I'm the only viewer who finds it rather less credible transplanted into the context of a love affair. I can't swallow the psychology of the ending at all -- it seems to come out of nowhere, or rather, out of arbitrary movie convention.But then, that's screwball comedy, which I suspect is the other part of my problem with the film. Screwball comedy has always struck me as the verbal equivalent of slapstick: personally, if Katherine Hepburn were to smash the dinosaur skeleton I'd just spent months reconstructing, I wouldn't find that a rationale for falling in love with her either...It's interesting seeing this picture after seeing "The Front Page" first. Although I wouldn't have said I had any clear visual recollection of the earlier film, certain setups -- such as the press-room overlooking the courtyard -- are instantly familiar. And "His Girl Friday" very clearly shows their joint stage origins in the way that almost all the actual action takes place off-screen; characters rush in and start telling each other all about what's just happened, or start delivering exposition over the telephone, but the entire story more or less takes place on three indoor sets, and the vast majority of it in a single room.Rosalind Russell makes a credible female news-hound (although the way that her middle-aged male counterparts treat her exactly as they treated male Hildy is a little incongruous -- 'one of the boys' or not, they don't even seem to notice she's female), and she displays an impressive range in the course of this film. The unmistakable features of Cliff Edwards can be spotted among her fellow reporters, and Helen Mack brings a darker note with her hectic portrayal of Mollie Malloy, victim of tabloid journalism. I'm not a tremendous fan of Cary Grant, and I was less impressed with him here that I have been elsewhere. The weak and corrupt elected officials, however, were beautifully judged, and Billy Gilbert shines as the emissary too stupid to be effectively bribed.The film is a fast-talking black satire on journalism and the US justice system, and thus far it admirably succeeds. It's also trying to be a screwball romantic comedy, and this aspect I find less convincing.My IMDb rating: seven. Worth seeing, worth recommending; not worth putting yourself to discomfort for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most over rated films of all time. I love plenty of Hawks, and Russell is great here, but Grant is rather one notish. He is much better in Notorious, but here to me seems just without any range, his circus skills coming through and that's about all. The final scene is fantastic however, and is all Russell's. When she breaks down and starts to cry it is amazing. As for the rest of the film, nope, sorry, not a single scene I would ever want to see again...well, not quite. The opening bit when she comes into the office is quite good, even though even there I find a little of Grant going a long way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>His Girl Friday</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cary Grant is doing what he does best in His Girl Friday--gruff-but-witty comedy. The realistic dialogue between him and Rosalind Russell as they play ex-spouses Walter and Hildy adds a lot to the sincerity of the comedy in the film. In fact, it's so fast-paced that the jokes alone seem to be moving the story along. When the other noise factors are considered, including (near constantly) ringing phones and the like, it can get almost overwhelming.Sound as an emotional tool is something that I'd find more typical of a dramatic film. But the stressful, fast-paced, noise-filled aspects of this movie (that permeate what would normally be portrayed as some simple, straight-forward situations or conversations) has a lot to tell about Walter's personality, Hildy's true nature, and the often morally ambiguous (or often just corrupt) life and career of "newspaper men" that the film warns the audience about right in the beginning. It was completely effective in doing so, but it honestly made me very anxious, which took away from some of the jokes.The jokes themselves, while witty, were sometimes quite topical, and I felt it aged the movie a bit. The story of things getting exploited and spun out of proportion by the press however, is fairly ageless.The cinematography itself was very straightforward. Visually, there weren't too many artful decisions. Not in costumes, framing, light, etc. This was not exactly disappointing, however, as it is a straightforward comedy and to expect a ton more seems unfair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts out with individuals speaking over one another and people coming in and out of the picture. It hard to follow with whom is supposed to have what role from the extras within the film.From the beginning of the movie you can feel the love of the two characters Hildy (Rosalind Russell) and Bruce (Ralph Bellamy). Hildy tells Walter that she is engaged and wants to get married and quit the newspaper business. Walter doesn't like what he hears. Walter Burns played by Cary Grant decides to let nothing in his way stop him from allowing his ex-wife to remarry.This show seemed more like a drama rather than a comedy. When Hildy is explaining the reenactment of the crime over the telephone, Walter sends a woman to the cab to try to win over Bruce while Hildy is waiting for Bruce to pay her. He is trying to sabotage the wedding. Walter has Bruce arrested a couple of times while setting him up but Hildy knows what is going on.The movie to me was very chaotic and wasn't pleasant for me to watch. I didn't enjoy the film and it was hard to keep my interest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A not so comedic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>His Girl Friday (1940) from Howard Hawksis an intriguing comedy. The film is humerus while the plot leaves most of the story to the imagination. The antagonist is a strong woman named Hildy Johnson played by Rosalind Russell. It is great to see an independent woman in a film taking place in the 1940s. The dialog starts off incredibly fast and stays that way. I feel that much of the humor is created by confusion. The film slows towards the middle. The press room scenes (where most of the film took place) had me falling asleep. I found some topics not so funny such as suicide. The film lacks the silliness that is found in other screwball comedies, it is not worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"His Girl Friday" is definitely a great comedy for not only its time but for today as well. There was such a great chemistry between Hildy and Walter that really made the movie. The movie definitely would not have work as well if they didn't have the great dynamic. It makes you wonder that if this is how they are being divorced, how was it when they were married. I have to also give credit to Bruce (Ralph Bellamy) for being kind of oblivious to being constantly pushed around by the dynamic duo. There was just great humor throughout the film that helped keep me hooked. And even through the whole movie took place in only a few sets, you could barely notice thanks to the constant humor that the two bickering divorcees made. Maybe not my favorite screwball comedy but definitely a pretty good one at that.</fullReview>

Rosalind Russel was beautiful and made great use of her eyes and oval face and you could tell that they were all having great fun. I thought some of the really wacky over-the-top scenes were wonderfully staged and funny, it was full of laughs at every corner.

There are so many little jokes in this movie, if you are not paying attention for a couple of seconds you are going to miss the humor. I had to re-watch this movie 2 times to fully understand every part in it. I was happy that I watched this movie 2 more times because I missed a lot of the little funny humor that is in it. This is an excellent screwball comedy for the Great Depression Era, you can see how most of the characters are middle class while Hildy is Extremely Wealthy. My favirote character was Bruce. Bruce is so nice but he gets played and used so many times by Hildey and Walter which is hilarious. Bruce doesn't understand that he is just being pushed around.

		<shortDescription>A classic in the world of comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although screwball comedies were a thing of the 1930's around the Great Depression, they can still entertain just as well today as they did back then.In Howard Hawks' classic "His Girl Friday" a newspaper editor (Cary Grant) tries to win back his ex (Rosalind Russell) before she decides to settle down with another man (Ralph Bellamy) and leave her old life behind her.Hawks' is undoubtedly a great director. For it's time, the film was an entertaining marvel. Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are irresistible and really the strong points of this movie. Their chemistry and fast paced responses keep the film moving.Because the newspaper industry is prevalent in the film, many of the characters are affected by this and thus, the actors have a tendency to speak rather quickly. This works for comedic effect but some viewers may be turned off by this fast paced dialog.Ironically, the film felt slow for me at certain points. I believe however that this just might be a personal fault, as I'm used to watching so many modern films.Overall however, this is a great film for those who are fans of the screwball comedy genre. The rest of us will enjoy it just as much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utilizing media literacy skills to construct a reflection of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Once upon a time?" usually acts as a precursor to fairy tales and other fictional stories. Though beginning with this phrase, His Girl Friday presents no fairytale to the audience, but rather a romantic comedy sopping with farcical reporters, bickering, and trickery. Cary Grant's somewhat stiff physique relays a slight emotional distance from his costar, Rosalind Russell, but through other effects, such as parallelism, their film consortium rekindles. Hildy Johnson (Russell) and Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy), when juxtaposed to Hildy and Walter Burns (Grant), relate a safe, lackluster relationship. Hildy and Walter possess similar qualities that draw them closer chaotic scene after chaotic scene; they both smoke, express assertion, and lust for current news. Early in the film, when Walter treats Bruce and Hildy to a multi-intentioned lunch, opposites clarify as the men battle for Hildy's attention. Bruce chooses not to smoke but Hildy and Walter do; this emphasizes merely one of the various differences between the two men in Hildy's life. Mother's boy Bruce seems light-years away from independent Walter. Through the dynamic grouping of Hildy and Walter throughout the film, His Girl Friday foreshadows that they will end up together. This technique of grouping can provide the inclination or extrapolation to audiences of possible outcomes; and I find it beneficial to the plot of the film because relationships in my own life could be better if I find similarities within them. Puffing smoke will not save the relationship on its own, but the parallelism launches the plot and pulls the hard-hitting journalists together for their whirlwind of a chase.Hildy's dynamite of a character certainly asserts herself and stays one step ahead of all the shenanigans Walter tries to pull on na?ve Bruce. Intelligent, independent Hildy portrays a more masculine woman, especially set in the forties, as she presents herself as career-oriented firecracker. Her souped up outfits complete with suits and fedoras flashes her personality as she works alongside men. Gender tension commonly appears in 1940s films, and His Girl Friday presents this with Hildy acting out of social norms, especially as a female reporter. Though Hildy contradicts many common characteristics of her time, she still gleams as the leading lady vulnerable to love. In the end, her heart goes to the man that closely reflects her qualities and fits into her intense personality best.Constant ringing of telephones, uneven window shades, and, at times, bustling reporters allude to chaotic undertones of the film; tumultuous conversing ensues as light-hearted murder looms. Layered banter and verbal sparring transform the film into a dialog-driven story, and much of the film contains scenes of confabulation rather than imagery and action. The scene at the very beginning of the film where Hildy tries to communicate to Walter that she will marry Bruce the next day works effectively within the plot because of its realistic nature. I also find that in conversation trying to explain myself and not knowing how to deliver my message quickly and to the point can further delay the inevitable. Especially evident through Mollie Malloy (Helen Mack) and her accusatory complaints, the film portrays journalists as cynical, hyperbolizing people, nearly dehumanizing them. Thus another chaotic-like facet of the film emerges through the façade of the journalists.Altogether the film presents a stream of laughs in an ocean of words as the characters juggle a murderer on the loose and controlling local officials.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is it possible not to love Cary Grant?...Well, the answer is definitely NO! "His girl Friday" proves the unique talent of this gifted actor.I don't think that any other choice for the role of Walter Burns could be more suitable and I don't think that anybody could doubt that easily.The film is a classic story that focuses on the battle of the sexes in an absolutely clever way using as a vehicle for this cause "the battle of the two exes"!! Walter Burns is the big editor of a newspaper and has less than 24 hours in order stop the departure and the imminent marriage of one of his best reporters who ...by the way...happens to be his adorable ex-wife!In order to do that he invents every possible trick in order to keep her by convincing her,in the first place, just to postpone her departure for a couple of hours in order to cover a scoop..but that is just the beginning...!Rosalind Russell is absolutely perfect on the role of Hildy Johnson, Walter's ace reporter and ex-wife, using sophisticated and hilarious lines in order to outsmart Grant's intelligence and she proves to be an equal opponent on this perfect and romantic battle.In my opinion,the battle of the sexes can turn out to be an excellent way to unfold a love story under the condition that is promoted in a clever way and "His girl Friday" is just one of the best examples.The chemistry of Grant and Russell is radiant and depicts perfectly the electricity between the two exes who are too proud to admit their feelings to each other!One of the best of screwball comedies ever made ,"His Girl Friday", definitely deserves 10/10. The speed of the delivery of the lines is so quick that at some points it resembles a tennis match, where the audience can't see the ball!!But that's what makes this film that special DON'T MISS IT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Front Page Turns for Rosalind Russell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>New York metropolitan area reporter Rosalind Russell (as Hildegard "Hildy" Johnson) arrives in the bustling office of "The Morning Post" to tell ex-husband and editor Cary Grant (as Walter Burns) she's leaving the business to marry insurance salesman Ralph Bellamy (as Bruce Baldwin). The couple plans to move up to the state capitol of Albany, where Ms. Russell wants to keep house and have Mr. Bellamy's children. Russell rejects Mr. Grant's offer to re-marry and remain a reporter. Sensing Russell really loves him and wants to continue her assignments, Grant maneuvers to have her cover the recent shooting of a "colored" policeman, by troubled bookkeeper John Qualen (as Earl Williams)...This re-make of Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's "The Front Page" most notably swaps the gender of the roles played by Russell and Bellamy, which gives everything a lift. Russell plays a strong "Hildy" but succumbs to some stereotypes by the end; still, we believe she will manage to asset herself in the future. The pace is breakneck and the script fast, with overlapping dialogue spilling out of the newsroom. Double-takes include the "pickaninny" story (carried over from the original) and the way Bellamy's character is described by Grant, "He looks like that fellow in the movies - Ralph Bellamy." Director Howard Hawks knows when to leave a take alone, and walk-ons like Billy Gilbert are great.******** His Girl Friday (1/11/40) Howard Hawks ~ Rosalind Russell, Cary Grant, Ralph Bellamy, John Qualen</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There were a lot of so-called women's pictures around this time, typically romantic dramas, and pretty much the only movies of that era with female protagonists. His Girl Friday is an oddity in that it began life as a Ben Hecht/Charles MacArthur play with a male lead. Somewhere in pre-production the decision was made to turn the hero of what was originally called The Front Page from Hildebrand to Hildegard. But this did not simply make it another women's picture.You see, although the title now reflects the gender-swap and the lines have even been re-jiggled to make Walter Burns the hero's ex-husband as well as ex-boss, this is still very much the same story as before. It's as if the female Hildy was there in potentia all along, with the familiar, quarrelsome relationship between journalist and editor having been very much like antagonistic ex-lovers all along. It's significant because this makes her a strong, professional character, as opposed to the floppy, flimsy females that screenwriters usually came out with in this era.The new Hildy is magnificently brought to life by Rosalind Russell. Russell is fluent in sarcasm, and the knowing, world-weary tone she brings to her lines is exquisite. She seems totally at ease amid the boys' club atmosphere of the newsroom, and more than able to carry the movie and match up to her exuberant co-star Cary Grant. Grant shows a touch of Ned Sparksism in his performance, and it is easy to see Burns as the sort of pompous grouch that Sparks would normally play. By and large though this is prime Cary, with plenty of ridiculous exclamations and indignant gestures, best of which is a dismissive flick of the hand as he tells everyone to "get out". There are plenty of fine supporting players too. Ralph Bellamy is perfect as Hildy's would-be husband Bruce, Bellamy being an intelligent man who is good at acting a buffoon.The action is overseen by ace director Howard Hawks. Hawks is brilliant at handling smooth switches between the general and the specific. The movie begins with a lengthy tracking shot (or rather two shots, but the blend is disguised) going right-to-left, showing off the indistinct business and bustle of the newsroom, before coming to rest on a slightly more empty end. Then Rosalind Russell enters, and we follow her with another tracking shot left-to-right. It's a great way of introducing the character. This second tracking shot is ostensibly a reversal of the one before it, but the first one is a broad picture of a place and the second has its focus on one person. Throughout, Hawks encourages not only the oft-praised overlapping dialogue, but also punchy visual collages of tense and hasty movements. Whenever the gaggle of reporters are in the room there's always one chewing gum or shifting his balance. His Girl Friday begins at high speed and from then on barely pauses for breath.Of course, not all the genuine women's pictures of the 30s and 40s were poorly-written, and in fact a lot of them I enjoy immensely. But seeing His Girl Friday, a woman's movie that became one almost by accident, is a breath of fresh air when one compares it to the stereotyped imagery that was actually pitched and presented to women. It also happens to be a fun, witty and nicely-made movie.</fullReview>

They were deliberately told to be as fast as possible for effect. The pacing is probably one of the best parts of this film, as it matches the stereotypical "news reporter" quickness.

		<shortDescription>Fast-paced comedy that portrays journalism in an unfavorable but hilarious light</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Morally objectionable journalism practices instigate absurd high jinks in Howard Hawks' "His Girl Friday," based on the play "The Front Page" by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur. The only thing more over the top than the rapid dialogue would be Hawks' portrayal of the newspaper business during an era where the press became part of the story rather than covering it objectively from the outside. Either way, it makes for good fun from an audience perspective.Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell star as Walter Burns and Hildy Johnson, ex husband and wife, the former the editor of a major New York City paper and the latter his ace reporter, one who intends to quit her job (and the profession for good) and remarry with a nice insurance salesman (Ralph Bellamy) in Albany. As a man on the losing of a divorce settlement who hardly has any scruples to begin with, Walter doesn't take kindly to the news and pulls the necessary strings to turn keep Hildy within his grasp. Apparently, that even means exaggerating the story of a man expected to be hanged for shooting a police officer to make it so juicy that Hildy can't stand to lose the scoop.The two have an excellent chemistry, but a kind much different than most films of that era. For one, the speaking lines are rattled off faster than usual and the banter much more hectic as a result. In ways this ups the humor because you barely have time to catch your breath in between the jokes, but at times it requires more focus than usual for a comedy. Hawks' likely desired to capture the hectic nature of 'the biz,' but it really just makes the film more ridiculous. Grant surprisingly thrives as Walter, a rather despicable role and Russell really stands out amongst the boys. It's hard to believe her character was male in the original play; she adds so much dimension and character to the film.Goofy would aptly describe "His Girl Friday" in a number of instances. It makes very light of some serious subject matters to suggest a satire of journalism in some regards, but it's mostly just insanely witty slapstick in fast motion. The character dynamic between Grant and Russell carries the first act until the goofiness takes over into a farcical second act. Although at breakneck speed, it's amusing to watch the reporters call up their news desks the second events change and start giving exaggerated accounts of everything."His Girl Friday" is not the iconic romantic comedy of the Golden Age, but then again, it was never intended to be a romantic film in any regard. Unusual for that time as well, it would probably require a second viewing to be most enjoyed as not having to figure out what's coming next would free up some time to truly listen and ingest Grant and Russell's terrific lines.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

The movie has hysterical moments in the beginning such as when Walter purposely shakes the old man's hand pretending that he is his ex-wife's fiancé. Walter was also very clever in the ways he set up for Bruce, (Hildy's fiancé,) to get arrested three times in one day. I also enjoyed how Hildy, (Walter's ex-wife) was a tough girl. She would always give her opinion right back to Walter. The only time she acted like a normal "in-love" woman was at the end when she decided she really did love Walter, and they started talking about the honeymoon they would now take.This movie starts off strong, with a lot of humor, but by the end it seems somewhat dragged out. The whole time Earl Wilson (the murder) was hiding in the desk just seemed much dragged out. The effects of when Earl escaped were very realistic. The gun shots and all the police cars running down the road, you feel like you are really there.</fullReview>

Though at some parts the pace was fast, you could still hear and point out the comedy laced within the lines.The storyline laced with the comedy made the movie enjoyable even though it was about a serious situation. The idea of the the characters being a part of the press also made the comedy even more enjoyable even with the limited use of settings.The setting, sound and acting was on the same level of greatness as it is today and made it fully enjoyable to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film, Great Actors!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always thought that Cary Grant and Rosilind Russell were great actors but when I saw "His Girl Friday" I was simply blown away by the chemistry between them. In this film they both truly shined and worked so well together, Grant played Walter Burns, a big time editor for a major newspaper called the Morning Post and Russell played his former star reporter and also his ex-wife!. Hildy Johnson (Russell) is about to marry Bruce, an insurance man, and they are planning on moving to Albany NY to live a quiet and peaceful life. Walter (Grant) isn't too pleased with the idea and talks Hildy into writing one last article for the paper, as she was the star reporter. The three characters get involved in many different situations mostly revolving around Walter's fear of letting Hildy go, some funny and some pretty serious with a twist. All in all this movie was really great and it was great to hear of a local place (Albany) in a big time film such as this. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a good comedy with an edge because of many factors including the amazing actors and the story line itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best comedies that I've ever seen. This is definitely an upbeat, fast paced comedy. It's one of those don't blink or you'll miss something kind of dialog. The movie has many scenes where two or more people are talking at the same time, which adds to the comedy of the scene, and you need to pay attention to what each person is talking about to get the story of the movie.Since there is a lot of dialog going on continuously over other conversations, it is important to get actors that can not only keep a straight face, but also who can get the dialog out for everyone to hear. Both Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell do a great job achieving this. Along with the acting, the idea of having a newly divorced couple attempting to work together is something that people can, in a way, relate to and the writing and directing for this movie was superb.</fullReview>

I feel that this was a very fast paced movie things happened really quick. I guess thats where there get screwball comedy from. It was really funny though. especially when Mr. Butler does everything possible to get his wife back. He comes up with fake money and lies about everything to get his ex wife and soon to be new husband to not make it to Albany to marry.

		<fullReview>His Girl Friday is held up by many as one of the best screwball comedies ever made and it's not hard to see why. Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are, respectively, a newspaper editor and a star reporter. They are also a divorced couple trying to quickly use each other before moving on to different aims (Russell's aim is to move on with her fiancé, played by Ralp Bellamy, while Grant's aim is to get a great story written by his ex-wife before/or at the same time somehow rekindling their relationship). Things move along at a rapid pace on the same day that a poor man looks set to be hung for an act of temporary insanity that deserves some inkling of lenience from those in power but is instead handled for political gain.Will Grant get Russell to print the best story for all concerned, possibly saving a salvageable soul and boosting circulation in the process? Will Russell get the better of Grant before quickly heading away to settle down and wed her fiancé? And will you keep up with the witticisms and one-liners as they stream across the screen, machine-gun style in an impressive display of verbal dexterity and brilliant wordplay? I really enjoyed this movie and that's in no small part due to the leads involved (Russell, Grant AND Bellamy). Everyone handles their material well and that's extremely important when dealing with the kind of rapid delivery that the "screwball comedy" utilised the most. Acting aside, the storyline is fun and packed with little strands that weave together beautifully, creating both a great comedy and a great background/developing tension FOR the comedy. In fact, my only complaints regarding this film are the sudden conclusions forced upon everyone in a brief final act that feels rather like it's shortchanging us after all that's gone before and the lack of genuine emotion from anyone in the film.But those minor flaws are easy to forget when the film contains so much sparkle, not to mention two of my favourite in-jokes ever (one involving a description of Ralph Bellamy and the other one that doesn't bode well for Archie Leach). Just a delight.See this if you like: Bringing Up Baby, Cary Grant, The Hudsucker Proxy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>deft, clever, classy and smart -- no wonder His Girl Friday is a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not much more can be said about His Girl Friday that hasn't been said before, except to note that the kind of class and style it represents seems so inappropriate nowadays, given our contemporary penchant for sadism, nihilism and paranoia (sometimes euphemistically called 'doom and gloom.') None of these will be found in this light, breezy, witty film, justly famed for its dialog, which features just the right amount of jibes at petty bureaucrats, government officials, political bosses and capital punishment. Director Howard Hawkes' camera flits around the claustrophobic set (entirely in the Press Room of the local police precinct where unjustly condemned prisoner Williams has been bound over for 'justice'to the corrupt Mayor and his henchmen) creating heightened tension which finds release in the barbed wit (Sample: "Say, I hear you're consorting with Stalin now?" "Yeah, they say you wear red underwear" -- would anyone under age 30 even catch the reference to 'red,' an early (and pejorative) term for Communist -- from the red of the former USSR's flag)? But never mind -- there are few dated references; most of the dialog is as fresh and clever today as it was in 1940. And the plot -- as newspaperman Grant tries to woo back ex-wife Rosalind Russell -- unfolds as easy on the eye as on the ear, with quick-reflex performances from the leads and rollicking assistance from Hawkes' impeccable style and deftness with the camera. A film easy to watch and a delight to contemplate, His Girl Friday deserves a paraphrase of the Earl of Southwell -- "Easy film-watching's darn hard film-making."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, Not Hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hawks' rendition of "The Front Page" is a fast and furious comedy about a newspaper editor trying to woo back his ex-wife, who is engaged to be married to someone else. The dialog comes at a rapid-fire pace and much of it is funny, including some inside jokes: Grant refers to a fellow named Archie Leach (Grant's real name) and describes Russell's fiancé as looking like "that movie actor, Ralph Bellamy." Grant is in his element and Russell has the role of her career. It loses some steam towards the latter part and the comedy is not sustained as well as the great screwballs of the era, including Hawks' earlier "Bringing Up Baby," but it's generally fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One would be hard pressed to point out a bigger con man in film than Cary Grant's character in "His Girl Friday", but pitted as he is against Rosalind Russell, I'd say he's more than met his match. In fact, as a newspaper reporter, Hildy Johnson shows her own seamy side as she leads convicted killer Earl Williams (John Qualen) down a questionable path with her line of inquiry. That whole 'production for use' business left me more than a little confused.For her part, Russell reminded me a little of Martha Raye from that frenzied scene when she was getting ready to take off on her honeymoon with Bob Hope in "Never Say Die'. Here you've got Hildy all full of vim and vinegar ready to charge after that jail break story, with Williams' life hanging in the balance. In the mean time, fiancée Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy) falls victim to all of Walter Burns' (Grant) machinations, which you know he's done time and time again with other poor schleps. Can you imagine if Burns had ambition in law or politics - he would have easily eclipsed those two paragons of incompetence, Sheriff Hartwell (Gene Lockhart) and Mayor Fred (Clarence Kolb). By the way, when did New York City ever have a sheriff?If you're paying too much attention to the story, you might be put off by the whole 'colored cop killing' that's making the 'Morning Post' headlines in the story. Team that up with Molly Molloy's (Helen Mack) suicide leap and you have a queasy denouement that makes the story something of a downer. Kind of makes you wish the paper were covering something a little more upbeat.If you like the kind of energy the movie generates, it would probably be worthwhile to take in a second viewing for all the lines that whizzed by the first time around. In my case, I missed the 'Archie Leach' reference. But give Columbia Pictures credit for allowing one of the funniest lines to remain in the picture. When Walter has small time hood Louie's moll tail Baldwin, she asks him what he looks like. The response - "He looks like, uh, that fella in the movies - you know, uh, Ralph Bellamy." - Beautiful!!</fullReview>

At times I felt like it was hard to understand what the actors and actresses were saying. I also thought the story was going to be more interesting but I found it quite dull. The actors and actresses in the story didn't entertain me as much as some of the other screwball comedies I've seen from this time period. Their punch lines weren't delivered very well and weren't effective. I wouldn't recommend other people go out of there way to see this movie.

		<fullReview>What I liked about this movie was the background plot-they are trying to get the story of the convicted man who is about to be executed. They appear to be a bit callous toward him, more interested in getting the story than whether he was innocent or deserved to be hung. But it also pointed out how politicians could influence the outcome and wanted the hanging done to garner votes without regard to the innocence or guilt of the man. But it did lend a certain seriousness to the movie that neither Bringing up Baby or It Happened One Night had. There was also some excitement with the gun fight and the police cars speeding about Rosalind Russell. I started to get a little annoyed and tired of the bickering between her and Cary Grant after while, but in the beginning it was quite fun. There was also seriousness when the convict's girlfriend jumped out the window. I can see that Howard Hawks directed both this and Bringing up Baby as they have the same witty, fast conversation and movement, however I thought Bringing up Baby the more superior and funnier movie. I also liked how, like Hepburn's character, Russell's character was an intelligent, independent woman who fit it among the men.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unscrupulous editor plots to keep his star reporter and ex-wife from remarrying.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this second film version of the hit play by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur The Front Page, New York newspaper reporter Hildy Johnson (played by Pat O'Brien in 1931) is now a sassy, confident woman (Rosalind Russell). Hildy has had enough of the newspaper life and is going to quit and marry dependable (boring) Bruce Baldwin (never-gets-the-girl Ralph Bellamy) and move to Albany. The thing is, her editor and ex-husband Walter Burns Cary Grant) doesn't want either thing to happen and tricks Hildy into covering just one more story ? that of a deluded radical charged with murder. What follows is a super-charged side-splitting satire of the headline-hungry newspaper business and of course, a bit of romance.Howard Hawks directs his stars and a brilliant cast of supporting players (Billy Gilbert, a real scene-stealing stand-out) at a breathless pace, using overlapping dialog to increase the feeling of frenzy. You'll want to watch this one again and again to catch all of the terrific dialog. Some of those witty lines (at least as legend has it) were improvised, such as when Grant describes Bruce Baldwin, saying that he "looks like that film actor, Ralph Bellamy." Later, during a rapid-fire telephone exchange, Grant responds to another actor's line with "The last person to say that to me was Archibald Leach just before he cut his throat!" (Archibald Leach of course, being Grant's real name.) Named to the National Film Registry in 1993.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dizzying dialogue and surprising cynicism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"His Girl Friday" is one of the most famous, fastest, and funniest of the "comedies of remarriage" popular in the 1930s and '40s. In it, newspaperman Walter Burns (Cary Grant) tries any means necessary to get back his ex-wife and ace reporter Hildy (Rosalind Russell) before she marries a mild-mannered insurance salesman (Ralph Bellamy) the next day.I had seen the first scene of "His Girl Friday" in a film class as an example of screwball comedy dialogue: Hildy comes into Walter's office to announce her upcoming marriage, but it turns into nearly ten minutes of reminiscing, bickering, and talking circles around each other. And they speak as fast as they can spit the words out! Grant and Russell obviously have a lot of fun playing off of one another, and their scenes made me almost dizzy with delight--marveling at the writing, the acting, and the sheer speed of it all! But, while I knew to expect a love-triangle plot and fast-paced dialogue from "His Girl Friday," I wasn't expecting it to be such a cynical and tough-minded look into the newspaper business. More than just a romantic comedy, it has an exciting subplot centered on serious issues like the death penalty and political corruption. An escaped prisoner points a gun at Hildy; Walter conspires with lowlifes to get Hildy's fiancé arrested. Both Hildy and Walter are pretty unscrupulous in pursuit of a good story, but this serves to humanize them--they're real people with big desires, not just machines spouting rat-a-tat dialogue. So above all, I loved how "His Girl Friday" maintains a balance between the down-and-dirty newspaper world and the ethereal giddiness of great comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moral center to the maelstrom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the late 20's Hecht and MacArthur were using Broadway (then Hollywood) to portray Chicago (...and by implication, national) politics in a much more cynical accurate way than audiences had been shown; in this case not only allowing some poor schmoe to be sent to the gallows, but hustling it along to meet an election deadline.Hawks improved on the original by noting a sexual tension between the characters Hildy and Walter and switching the gender of Hildy. I agree with everyone else; this is a stroke of genius. (And I'm very familiar with the original.) While I don't dislike Cary Grant, I'm not in the "He's so classy and talented" crew. But he has some damned funny scenes in this.By the time Grant and Russell are alone in the pressroom making phonecalls and shouting a lot, you may have reached your limit. It's pitched a little too frantic and loud, like the entire movie Arsenic and Old Lace did (also a Grant pic). But it's a small flaw.In comparing this movie to a similar movie concerning a little man, Capra's Meet John Doe is such a treacly, less honest, more conniving take on the topic. You may forget at certain points through all the cynicism that HGF supports a form of activist and advocate journalism. And that even if the leads are externally hard-bitten they are trying to save the life of an innocent man; the moral center of the movie.There are still rubes who believe that a president is exactly whom he presents himself to be. This movie shows that they're only 90 years behind the times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just this morning, as I was flicking absent-mindedly through the television channels, I accidentally clicked my way onto Channel 31 (Australia), which, I hazard to venture, is not generally known for its quality programming. Luckily, my eye was momentarily caught by a young and sharp-looking Cary Grant, and I immediately identified the film to be 1940's 'His Girl Friday,' which I had been meaning to watch for some months. Just like Frank Capra's holiday favourite 'It's A Wonderful Life,' the film has fallen into the public domain, and so television stations are completely free to air it whenever they want. This also means that any company is allowed to throw a poor-quality print onto DVD at practically no cost to them, so this is something to be wary of. Unfortunately, I missed a few minutes of the beginning of the film, but I was too hooked into the story to worry about that until later.For his remake of the 1931 film 'The Front Page' (which was directed by Lewis Milestone and starred Adolphe Menjou), Howard Hawks took the story ? complete with all its witty, rapid-fire dialogue ? and changed the male character of Hildebrand 'Hildy' Johnson to a female ? Hildegaard 'Hildy' Johnson (Rosalind Russell) ? and also the ex-wife of the newspaper editor, Walter Burns (Cary Grant). When Hildy expresses her intentions of quitting the newspaper business and marrying Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy) in Albany, Walter takes every precaution possible to prevent her from boarding that train. With a convicted cop-killer, Earl Williams (John Qualen), set to be hanged in the morning, the press-room at the prison is abuzz with vulturous reporters scavenging about for a good story. Rather than simply admitting his continuing love for Hildy, Walter uses the great lengths to which he will go to stop her leaving to tell her how he still feels about her. Also, along the way, Hildy discovers ? as the night gradually becomes more and more exciting ? that she is a reporter at heart, and will never be able to rid herself of the desire to uncover that perfect story.The jokes come thick and fast, with the talented cast delivering the clever dialogue faster than you can register it, barely giving you any time to laugh. Especially in screwball comedies such as these, actor confidence is absolutely essential, and everybody involved here performs admirably. In addition to the entertaining and often-heated banter between Walter and Hildy, other excellent characters include Bruce Baldwin (the unfortunate would-be future husband whose is arrested on no less than three occasions, and whose mother is kidnapped), the bumbling Sheriff Peter B. Hartwell (Gene Lockhart), Walter's sneaky henchman, Diamond Louie (Abner Biberman), the governor's clueless delivery-man, Joe Pettibone (Billy Gilbert) and a long line of newspaper reporters, each of whom witnesses the same event and yet still reports it in a completely different and entirely inaccurate manner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"His Girl Friday" is another of a long line of movie adaptations of one of the mainstays of comedy. There's a reason for this. The script is just simply hilarious. The characters could all come from a Marx Brothers or Monty Python movie, so don't look for depth, but they aren't one dimensional either. In fact, for a slapstick, down and out laugh-o-rama, this movie tries to instill a lot of depth into their characters. The plot is about the distinguished journalists of the era, and pokes fun at what they were really like. Everyone is out for a scoop, and will do anything to get it. Corrupt officials and an escaped soft spoken murderer make this even easier for the reporters. Cary Grant, of course, leads the stellar cast. He could make "Equus" look exciting, so give him a great screenplay, and he comes through. Of course all the movie versions were hilarious. It might depend on whether you prefer Grant or Mattheau. They don't make comedies like this any more. You know, funny ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"His Girl Friday" is just slightly overrated but still one of the most delightful film comedies ever made. First the bad. There is so much going on at once in the screwball script it can occasionally become confusing. Also, having the character of Molly Malloy awkwardly stops the film dead in its tracks from its lighthearted tone. These are just minor complaints however as the film is so cleverly written it hardly matters. The jokes come a mile-a-minute and are always hilarious and quotable. This is some of the best dialog ever caught on camera. As usual, Howard Hawks' direction is quite good and this is one of the first films to feel completely comfortable with the advent of sound (an innovation that had been around for over a decade by that point).In addition to the great screenplay, the actors are all perfect. Cary Grant commits so many despicable and dishonest actions throughout to win back his ex-wife yet remains lovable throughout. I guess its because hes Grant and is always charming no matter what the role is. Rosalind Russell is also great as the fiercely independent female trying to leave behind her corrupt reporter position to a more normal family life. Both actors have more chemistry than ten recent so-called "romantic" comedy couplings combined. The romance is strong but never becomes sappy, and the film manages to balance many more serious themes (such as political and media corruption) with consistent humor. The pace is breakneck and overall this is one of the most entertaining films from the classic Hollywood era. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell star opposite each other in the classic Howard Hawks 1940 comedy 'His Girl Friday'. This film is remarkable for it's pace and snappy dialogue.Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell,in a superb performance) is an ace news reporter preparing for her second marriage. She loves her job, but her sweet yet boring insurance salesman fiancé Bruce (Ralph Bellamy) would prefer her to be a housewife, not a career woman. Hildy warms to the idea, and goes to the office to tell her editor Walter Burns (Cary Grant, great as usual)she's through with the newspaper game and ready for the quieter side of life. Trouble is, Walter hates the thought of losing his star reporter and ex-wife to another man and cooks up a series of schemes to get Bruce out of the picture and Hildy to stay on the job! He's still in love with her of course, and convinces her to cover one last big story about murderer Earl Williams, who is on death row. Will he get her back or will Hildy's last hurrah satisfy her? Poor Ralph Bellamy. In both this and 'The Awful Truth' he has to play the poor sap to the witty, urbane Grant. Ros Russell matches Grant with every line, and it is amazing how fast she could deliver her lines. Grant was the undisputed king of comedy and fast-pacing, yet Ros almost tops him in this one! They are marvellous together, and ooze sophistication. The funniest moments in this film definitely come from the Grant-Russell teaming, and Grant's series of pranks to get rid of Bellamy. There is rarely a gag that fails to deliver. My only query about the film is, surprisingly, the dialogue. There's nothing wrong with it, it's just delivered so fast that some words are missed completely in the speed of it all.'His Girl Friday' is also a great satire of the newspaper industry and the length reporters will go to to cover a story. Catch the inside jokes about Ralph Bellamy and 'Archie Leach'- pure wit and cheek! 9/10.</fullReview>

Billy Gilbert's only other film roles that even came close to this one were when he played opposite Laurel and Hardy in "County Hospital" and "The Music Box." It's a shame that Cary Grant never received an Oscar (except for the 1970 Honorary Oscar). He certainly deserved one for "His Girl Friday." This is also a shining role for Rosalind Russell. The many supporting players match the leads in their adroitness. Though this movie has been remade several times and was itself a remake to some extent, none of the copies come close to a match. Watch and savor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A farce with a live, beating heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made as disposable entertainment in its time has later become a classic screwball comedy throughout succeeding generations. Howard Hawks' 'His Girl Friday' (1940) is a film that all comedies should aspire to, not plagiarize, in one way or another. For in it do we get a hyper-real, deliriously delicious blend of ludicrous situation, pitch-perfect acting and, most importantly, ingenious dialogue. What's also important is that we don't think for one second that there's the slightest measure of implausibility in this film. That's because these characters are essentially human ? we get a peek at both their glorious and vulnerable moments.Hildy Johnson is the girl Friday ace journalist for the newspaper run by the conceited, incorrigible corrupter of news items Walter Burns. She wants out. Bruce Baldwin, the clueless insurance salesman, is the chute out of the fast life that she'll ride. Early in the film Hildy approaches Walter in order to tell him that she's quitting the newspaper business in order to fulfill her natural role as a female by getting married to a buttoned-down, decent, and unambitious man and pushing out some pups with him. Well, this troubles Walter and he barely lets us, the audience, know this ? all we see is a back going rigid and hear a voice silenced. Cary Grant as Walter Burns is uncannily good as a bloodless newspaper hound. He applaudingly defeats his romantic, man-of-every-woman's-dreams persona with this nasty, in-the-media-dirt being (we relievingly don't see him in a tux for a change!). The rest of the film depicts the underhanded travails and sadistic maneuverings of this conniving, yet affable beast of a human being.Granted, we are needlessly subjected to cheap, dollar-book Freudianism but we don't care ? our adrenaline more than compensates for it.'His Girl Friday' repays repeated viewings for several reasons, but I'll only mention one: the film is overstuffed with jokes and lyrical, well-timed dialogue. I'd rather not give any for-instances because that'd be unfair ? only the actors are deserving of delivering.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a wonderful old B&amp;W comedy with Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'His Girl Friday' deserves its place in film history. Cary Grant plays a rascal, a quick-thinking publisher and ex-husband of crack reporter played by Rosalind Russell. The whole charm of the movie is the smart dialog between the two of them. The rest of the story is there to make it a 90-minute movie instead of just 30 minutes. It has a 'stage' feel to it, the exaggerated gestures of the characters and the 'stage' delivery of lines. The restored version on DVD is very nice, and includes a very interesting 28-minute 'extra' on Cary Grant's career, including clips from many of his most popular roles.SPOILERS follow for my own recollection -- he has not seen her in about 4 months, still longs for her, finds out she is about to marry an honest but dull insurance salesman from Albany, NY. Intent on spoiling the wedding and winning her back, he throws in several deceptions, including a hooker and some counterfeit cash, both of which land the intended groom temporarily in jail. Meanwhile she is doing an interview and article on a convicted murderer who claims he is innocent, a jail-break occurs, they hide the convict in the roll-top desk, police show up, but a pardon is granted, and in the end Grant and Russell plan to get married again, and take a real honeymoon, to Niagra Falls.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since the 40's, there were significant technological developments in the journalism world, but the nature of journalism hasn't changed at all, including the journalists themselves.This film presents a very intensive day in the world of crime reporters. Although it seems the film criticizes these guys, it is a mild and humorous criticism. It's quite obvious that the writers admire these guys, although don't always agree with their methods.To my opinion the plot is not too sophisticated, but the dialogues are sharp and funny.

		<shortDescription>Talk fast, listen hard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell star as Walter Burns and Hildy Johnson respectively in one of the fastest-talking screwball comedies--make that movies--ever made. HIS GIRL FRIDAY is a clever script teeming with fab dialogue, delivered by a top-notch cast, and captured by one of the best directors of Hollywood's Golden Age, Howard Hawks. It makes you care about the characters, and about what happens to them; it makes you think and listen hard; in short, it makes you as a viewer do and feel things so many modern movies just can't be bothered with. If I have any kind of complaint about this movie at all, it's that there just wasn't enough screen-time for Cary Grant. (Is there ever?) He gives one of his best performances here--his Walter is fast-talking, cheating and conniving, with hardly any redeeming qualities... except that undeniable and inescapable charm Grant lends to all his characters. A fine and perfectly respectable way to spend a couple of hours. Watch this with someone--it might turn them onto classic movies, just as it did some people in the cinema with me today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very, very funny movie, this rapid-fire farce combines a terrific cast, a great script, and a plot that lends itself wonderfully both to comedy and satire. There are more funny lines and good gags than you can count, even when you've already seen it a few times.Cary Grant is excellent at this kind of manic comedy, and Rosalind Russell gives what had to be one of her very best performances, as a worthy foil for Grant's domineering character. Ralph Bellamy is also ideal as the naive insurance salesman, and they are backed up by a cast filled with fine comic character actors. Some of the supporting cast do a terrific job of getting laughs with very limited screen time. They all get great material to work with, too. The dialogue is just amazing, with funny, creative lines coming constantly - sometimes literally on top of each other. The setting and the plot create hilarious situations and some great opportunities to satirize politicians and the news media. If anything, the satire is even funnier and more appropriate as regards today's institutions than it was in 1940."His Girl Friday" is absolutely hilarious, a classic comedy that you can watch and enjoy over and over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real rarity - a comedy that's actually funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There really aren't any good comedies around at the moment. Within the past five years or so, there have been only two that have really stood out; There's Something About Mary, and The Castle. If you don't like Jim Carrey, lazy spoofs, or the gross-out 80s teen revival, you're not going to find many laughs in the cinema.There seems to be an increasing reliance on cross-genre films, that describe themselves as comedy-drama to excuse their lack of laughs. One good joke every half hour is the usual average, and the TV sitcom has overtaken cinema as the most reliable joke-teller. It's frustrating that there are a few laughs every minute in a 22 minute episode of Seinfeld or Roseanne, but a movie sets its sights so low that you're lucky to find one memorable line in the whole thing.It's refreshing, then, to go back to when comedies were actually funny, and funny for their intelligent dialogue as opposed to second rate sarcasm, and funny for their inventive slapstick as opposed to someone just slipping on a puddle of vomit and falling on his arse. The speed and intelligence of His Girl Friday puts modern comedies to shame.Every Cary Grant movie has charm just from his being cast, and he is matched here by Rosalind Russell. They combine to bring one of the funniest partnerships in film, and their extraordinary chemistry lends credibility to the obvious ending. It's predictability comes not from being such a clichéd plot device, but from their attraction being obvious and genuine from the outset. The venomous insults from Russell and the devious flirting from Grant are just perfect.The pace of the film is mentioned in every review, and it has to be mentioned again here. It's simply breathtaking, and shows supreme confidence in getting more jokes out in one scene than most movies manage in their entire running time. There are moments when it gets frustrating because laughter from one joke drowns out the next, and without the rewind button half the script would go unheard. The quality and concentration of the jokes guarantee that this is one to watch over and over.Beyond the manic pace and endless one-liners, there are serious points that give the film a greater depth. It has much to say about career politicians, who care only for their ambitions, and the role of the press, who care only about their story. There is a surprising cynicism that translates perfectly to a modern audience, and Grant's idea that `divorce doesn't mean anything nowadays' is wonderfully cutting and more relevant now than back then. It is equally modern in its presentation of Russell, who is acknowledged as the best of the reporters. Surprising for a film of such age, her character is never patronised, and never treated as a gimmick. Indeed, the only things that date it at all are the few references to Hitler and the `European War'.It's hard to write a review that does justice to such a great comedy without quoting half of it, but the jokes deserve to be seen in context and delivered by the cast itself. But I have to mention the great in-jokes, of Cary Grant describing Russell's fiancé as looking `like that actor Ralph Bellamy', and then making a quick reference to Archie Leach.His Girl Friday is one of the funniest, fastest comedies ever made, and when you next come back from the cinema in a bad mood after seeing the latest non-comedy, stop by a video store and rent this to remind yourself that some films can actually make you laugh.</fullReview>

The chemistry between these two masterful actors is simply glorious. I'd happily watch them mouthing-off and getting clever with each other for two hours without a plot.

		<fullReview>You are in good company when you watch this film -Howard Hawks knows what he is doing, and YOU know it too! He has also got on screen two of the finest comic performances from two of the finest light-comedy actors ever. Rosalind Russell is a rare blend of determination, cool-headed excitement and compassion, and is a formative female protagonist in an otherwise totally male film. Her performance appeals to our sense of fairness as well as our sense of humour, and we both share her desire to escape the newspaper world and see that such a dynamic soul will never be truely happy in the secure but dull arms of Ralph Bellamy's character. Cary Grant is the perfect antagonist, and the perfect opposite to Bellamy. Despite the fact that so many of the qualities Grant displays are morally dubious, we delight totally in his unscrupulous machinations, and have very little sympathy for the morally correct character that Bellamy plays. This is a fascinating observation on the way screen sympathies defy normal day-to-day behaviour. Cary Grant gave many fine performances during a particularly dignified career, but this is in my opinion one of his best, and is certainly my own favourite. There is something of the Falstaff mentality in him -both can lie and exagerate without compuction, and we love them for it even though we are horrified too. And yet there is always a little glimpse of something more in his character than the flippant rogue. The machine-gun retorts, the scheming and the suave "performance" all mask something -though we never learn enough about him to know what. Thus the part is ideally suited to Grant, whose charming screen persona was in many ways a cover for a more introverted psyche. The film cannot lose with these two and the script, and the way Hawks allows his actors to "cover" a scene. Look at some of those scenes and you will see how many of them are done in one shot. The dialogue and the chemisty between Grant and Russell is really allowed to sparkle because of this, and the scenes are very slick in their dynamics. Fortunately the supporting cast are marvellous too, and the scenes in the newsroom at the jail have an intrinsic comic quality of their own which marry very nicely with the "main" body of the comedy in the action between Grant and Russell. There is an invasion of this world when Grant arrives there towards the end of the movie. The pace quickens there as soon as he appears, and it is as if the story goes into a different key -more intense and electric, and it stays like this until the end. HIS GIRL FRIDAY is a movie that demands multiple viewing, and which will continue to delight each time. If you get tired of the plot or the script, just enjoy the performances and note the countless nuances, or take a moment to admire the stylish ease of Grant's suits against Bellamy's awkward costume, or indeed the photography, the lighting, the editing...or if (God forbid) you finds it really boring after a hundred viewings, try counting how many words are said in the first scene between Russell and Grant!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie has a very witty script! The situation comedy is just hilarious!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most interesting thing about those old movies to me is how much action can happen in so little space. Same thing happened in "Key Largo." The most fascinating thing is how fast those people talk, how fast they move, how fast they talk and move, but they really don't go anywhere. Low budget and an action packed!!! Leonard Maltin points out that this movie is a remake of a movie "The Front Page." I thought the script was all new, since the movie is so old. Well one cannot assume anything as far as Hollywood goes, seldom one sees a brand new script. One should never take for granted a new script. That however, does not take anything away from this funny comedy. I liked the movie, and I must confess that sometimes even the natives have problems understanding such fast paced English. That is a clever idea because the audience feels that many facts are happening, when in reality no one is going anywhere, and what we are seeing is just a very witty script. I recommend it, and I believe that most people would enjoy it! I also love those 1940's dresses that Rosalind Russell wore in the movie. My favorite scenes": Walter Burns" Cary Grant (Father Goose, An Affair to Remember) framing the other guy "Bruce Baldwin" Ralph Bellamy (Trading Places, and 133 other movies) getting him into trouble all the time. The way "Hildy Johnson," Rosalind Russell, (Auntie Mame, Gypsy) will be at Walter's by Friday. The situation comedy is just hilarious! Favorite Quotes: Hildy Johnson: "Walter, you're wonderful, in a loathsome sort of way." Bruce Baldwin: "Nice little town, Albany. They've got a state capital there, you know." Bruce Baldwin: " He's got a lot of charm." Hildy Johnson: "Yes, it comes naturally; his grandfather was a snake." This movie is a classic. It is so much fun! I recommend it. After you watch try to talk as fast as they did in this movie, ha!</fullReview>

Not a car chase, mind you, but a high-heel chase.I mean, of course, Roz Russell's sprint after the buffoon of a sheriff in "His Girl Friday," as she literally pursues her story. Watch her gain speed like an Olympian -- in four-inch platform heels and a knee-length skirt. Watch the glorious climax, as she tackles him to the ground and pins him until he gives her the scoop.Hildy Johnson is far and away the most intelligent, sophisticated, accomplished and admired reporter of the many presented in this film -- and she is openly acknowledged as such. Not bad for a working girl in 1940.Something that might get lost in the film's sizzling dialogue and 80-mph pace is the news story that sets the plot into place -- the imminent hanging of Earl Williams. "His Girl Friday" has some interesting, subversive things to say about the death penalty. Not bad for a Hollywood comedy circa 1940.See this one, folks. Roz deserves it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Girl Worth Seeing On Columbia Tri-Star's Remastered DVD!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"His Girl Friday" is Howard Hawk's inspired remake of the award-winning Broadway play and previous movie release of "The Front Page". It's the story of a rapid fire newspaper editor, Walter (Cary Grant) and his star reporter and ex-wife, Hildie Johnston. Hildie has decided to retire to the country with her soon to be new husband (Ralph Belamy). But when a prison break captures the imagination of a troupe of cutthroat reporters, all rabid for the scoop, Hildie sets aside marital bliss for one last hurrah behind the desk as a cub reporter. THE TRANSFER: BEWARE THIS DVD! There are no less than 12 bootlegged versions of "His Girl Friday" circulating through various vendors on DVD. In all but one case the image quality looks as though the entire print had been fed through a meat grinder. The version you want is the one from Columbia Tri-Star Home Video. Its packaging features a disclaimer that reads "mastered from the original camera negative." This version of "His Girl Friday" exhibits ?in short ? exemplary video quality. The B&amp;W picture has been completely restored. Age related artifacts are nonexistent. The gray scale, black and contrast levels are perfectly realized. Fine detail will astound. There are no digital anomalies. The audio is mono but very nicely cleaned up.EXTRAS: This version also includes some very nice ? if all too brief ? featurettes on the careers of its stars Rosiland Russell and Cary Grant and the making of the film. There's also the original theatrical trailer.BOTTOM LINE: This girl is worth seeking out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What did I treat you like? A water buffalo?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few weeks ago I reviewed one of Grant's earlier projects with director Howard Hawks called Bringing Up Baby and completely despised it. It was annoying, unfunny, and the timing was completely moldy. Well, maybe Hawks learned from his mistakes because His Girl Friday was the direct opposite. While in Baby I thought that Grant and Hepburn made a horrific team whom couldn't play off each other, in this film Grant's chemistry with Rosalind Russell is impeccable. They both know timing and they both are able to keep up with each other. Both have their characters developed and understood so even if there was some ad lib mixed in with the script, we wouldn't know because they are able to playfully compete with each other on screen. The story is rather dark, surprisingly, which keeps the viewer attracted to the themes and plot, which unfolds with lightning speed in front of us. You have the sensation that Hawks felt comfortable with this film, the challenges and the actors unlike the outcome of Bringing Up Baby. Everyone involved seems to be on top of their game providing yet another memorable chapter in "screwball comedy" history.I must say that originally my impression of Cary Grant was not a desirable one. My first film viewed in which he stars did not leave a great taste in my mouth, but thankfully he was able to counter with this film. Grant seemed born to play Burns, and I wonder if it wasn't more comforting for him. He seemed relaxed in this role, familiar with his mannerisms, and completely in control. His ability to be constantly above 100% in each scene we watch was impressive, but what I found most enjoyable was Rosalind Russell's performance. She matched what Grant had and raised it even higher. You could not keep your eyes off her as she controlled every scene she was involved with. Her ability to be stronger than the male characters, and honestly smarter, was impressive for a film made in the 1940s. This was a strong woman doing a man's job, and I wouldn't be surprised if Hawks wasn't trying to tell us something here. While the ending of the film didn't seem to fit as well as the rest of the film with Russell, she was so charismatic, so charming, and so innocent, that you could not help but root for her during the entire run. She captured you and never let you go! While the characters did create this film and keep you laughing constantly, the story wasn't shabby either. It was actually a very dark story, darker than I anticipated a film starring Cary Grant would be. Here you have a newspaper conglomerate that has the power to sway the decisions of Governors, to take sides in public matters, to cohort with evildoers and still remain at the top of their game. While I do believe Hawks was trying to recreate the reality of such a fast paced work environment, I couldn't help but wonder if he wasn't speaking even on broader terms. Did he hold some animosity towards the media? Did Hawks think that perhaps the media was swaying the public's image away from the truth? One scene that I thought was sheer brilliance was when Molly Malloy (Helen Mack) arrived in the press room frantically yelling about how the newsmen smeared the truth throughout the paper. It was so bad that she herself couldn't remember what really happened. It seemed that every word that came from Molly's mouth was twisted into a new, far-fetched story. It was similar to a game of telephone. The truth may be staring you in the face, but when it reaches the end of the line, it may be something completely different. I think Hawks was trying to tell us something. Even when Molly finally reaches her climactic scene, you cannot help but wonder if she doesn't represent a part of Hawks, or the entertainment industry, or anyone hurt by the media. Inside this "screwball comedy" was something deeper and very disturbing.Overall, I was impressed with this film. I loved the language of the characters. I love the way that Cary Grant embodied this manipulative man who got everything he reached out for. Beware those thinking that this is a feminist film, while there may be a very strong central female character, the smarter Grant constantly undermines her. The ending was the only part of this film that I had trouble dealing with. While Hawks was trying desperately to drive a point home, it just seemed choppier than the rest of the film. The ending felt rushed and completely bland. I needed a stronger structure, but was extremely happy with the rest of the film. This was an amazing feature, for both the creative and charismatic characters that were painted onto the screen, but also with the hidden themes that Hawks threw in between jokes. I found myself laughing and thinking at the same time. This truly was one of those films that was released well before its time.Grade: **** out of *****</fullReview>

I haven't seen much of her earlier work, and always thought of her as the Mother Superior in "The Trouble With Angels". She was quite beautiful here, and played her role with the feistiness it required. But the whole thing left me a bit cold, and not for the reasons mentioned by others (overrunning dialog, insensitive plot elements like suicide and execution, politically incorrect references to black folks). Interestingly, I felt the same way when I saw Billy Wilder's version with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matheau. With the cast and directors of both films among my favorites, I'm at a bit of a loss as to why I didn't care all that much for these films. I suppose that I simply wouldn't have cared for the original play, and all dissatisfaction stems from that</fullReview>

This movie is worthy of all the praise it gets. One thing I realized while watching this film, a lot of the classic comedies are founded on good witty dialogue.

		<fullReview>Howard Hawks, as Pauline Kael claims, may not have invented rapid crossfire dialogue (his source material, the play `The Front Page' probably accounts for that and screwball comedies like `It Happened One Night' can also be cited) but he was a master of it and `His Girl Friday' pins its humor on cynical wit delivered with speed. Cary Grant is absolutely charming as newspaper editor Walter Burns, a rogue with tunnel vision focused only on scooping the competition. With an execution about to take place, he calls upon his ace reporter, Hildy Johnson (a smooth but vulnerable Rosalind Russell), who just happens to be Burns' ex-wife and who is planning to retire and settle down with creampuff insurance agent Bruce Baldwin (the ever-likable Ralph Bellamy). The action shows its stage roots, confined mostly to several indoor sets and the pace flags a bit toward the end but overall the film is a sharp undertaking, a sardonic comedy with dark currents of Depression-era despair embedded in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I finally caught this movie on AMC. It was just hilarious. For an 18 year old to be saying that about a movie made 41 years before his time is something. This is a fast-paced movie that just does not let you rest, let alone laugh. I was too busy listening to laugh much, but I smiled throughout, not wanting to miss a word, which I did anyways. Some of the dialogues caught me at a surprise, and made me laugh, and the rest made me want to laugh. A movie must be good to keep me from laughing, but making me want to. Russell and Grant rip into each other faster than you can say quick quip. Bellamy plays an effective sap "Burns is such a nice fellow," and the rest of the roles go off without much of a problem. See this movie if you haven't. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rosalind Russell At Her Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is my personal most favorite movie starring Rosalind Russell. Many may choose her "Mame" or "Gypsy" as her very best, but I think for her comedic talent "His Gal Friday" is her very best. Whenever she shared the screen with Cary Grant there was a fast-paced banter that magically makes me cackle. Grant is suave as always and just look at the sharp 40's style suits that Russell is dressed in. Love the hats. Have you ever heard anyone put so many words into a sentence without drawing a breath as when she finally for the umpteenth time tells Walter Burns (Grant) that she's out of the news business while tearing up her last interview? And then, maybe predictably, as the latest news breaks right in front of her, she automatically turns into a relentless news hound! This is a smart movie, it has plenty of plot and character development, it has great strong characters, it makes commentary on the newsbusiness then that is relevant to the newsbusiness today and sarcastically shares the modern view of government I think, as well. This is a classic movie that is perhaps timeless. See it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By far the best version of "The Front Page"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Front Page" (or variations thereupon) has been filmed many times, but Howard Hawks's gender-altering take on the classic newspaper comedy is far and away the fastest, funniest, and most memorable. It's "gender-altering" because Hildy Johnson, here played by Rosalind Russell, was a man in the stage version (and Pat O'Brien in Lewis Milestone's 1931 filming). Luckily Hawks resisted the urge to turn Hildy into one of his strangely glib and yielding heroines (see assorted Hawks dames played by Lauren Bacall and Joanne Dru), and Russell's witty and tough-minded Hildy has (or should have) served as a primary role model for several generations of working women."His Girl Friday" is loaded with great "in" jokes about Archie Leach (Grant's original moniker) and how the Ralph Bellamy character resembles Ralph Bellamy, and it has a wonderfully spontaneous quality that was very rare in '40's films. The only thing I'd quibble with is that at moments, at least in the raucous context of the rest of the story, the Grant-Russell romance feels a wee bit mushy and out of place.Note to the next (inevitable) guy who's thinking of redoing "The Front Page": Why not go back to Milestone's Ur-version (no romance, no sentimentality) and keep Hawks's inspired sex change?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A triumph for Rosalind Russell...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rewrite of "The Front Page" has unscrupulous New York newspaper editor attempting to woo away his former star-reporter--and ex-wife--from her new beau just so he can get a juicy lead column out of her regarding a poor schnook who's about to be executed for shooting a policeman ("A colored policeman...and the colored vote is very important in this town!"). Trenchant comedy about the news-biz seems tailored to stars Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, yet only Russell is really convincing in this madcap scenario. Grant, very young and perhaps a bit over-eager, gives Russell someone to bounce off of, but she's the one to watch. This black-and-white film, directed by the esteemed Howard Hawks, is an eyesore to look at, with flat, standard shots and dull set-ups. However, the editing keeps it fresh and, though the plot itself isn't worked out satisfactorily, the star-charisma does make it enjoyable. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those comedies where, if you are a fan of movies like What's Up Doc, you'll love it. If you like simple, yet funny movies where you don't need to listen to every single word that comes out of the actor's mouth, this is not for you. Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell star in this fast talking comedy, His Girl Friday. Although Russell is the star of this film, it is Cary Grant that gets the top credits. He spends most of the movie walking in and out of the office to talk on the phone. It is Russell, who sadly is a dime a dozen for today's standards, who the movie is really about. Some racist moments that are far from funny for today, if you look close, you can see a "black face" painted for the newspaper story in the background. Kind of like the white guy who was portraying a black guy in Birth of a Nation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute and somewhat funny, but not as great as I thought it would be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching `His Girl Friday' I could see why it is widely thought of as a good film and a clear representative of the screwball comedy/fast-talking dame genre, (and a still of Rosalind Russell from this movie is indeed the cover of the book, `Fast Talking Dames') but after it ended I wondered why it was this film that has widely been deemed as the personification of, or even the best of this genre as opposed to its contemporaries. Remade several times, (and in fact, this was a remake itself) `His Girl Friday' is about Hildy Johnson (Russell), an intrepid reporter who decides to leave the journalist life and marry Bruce (Ralph Bellamy), a boring and bland man who is direct contrast to her conniving and charming ex-husband (and former editor) Walter (Cary Grant). During the course of the film, Hildy finds herself sucked back into `just one more story' and mayhem ensues. There is nothing wrong with the acting in the film, it is all quite good; and the script is also fairly funny, if a little dead at times, but I guess my expectations were higher since it was in a fairly high position on the IMDB 250 list. I'm sure that popularity and exposure is the answer to my question, but I found myself comparing other films from the same time that I thought were much better, (notably, Preston Sturges' `Unfaithfully Yours' which is an absolute scream) and wondered what made this film more highly regarded. Certainly, star power is another factor, and Cary Grant had it in spades.There isn't a lot that I can specifically criticize the film for, and while it certainly didn't raise my ire up like a lot of films I dislike, it instilled a feeling in me that is almost worse ? ambivalence. I'm glad I saw it finally, but there was nothing exciting about it to deem a repeat viewing anytime in the future.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Screwball Comedy Masterpiece by Craftsmanship of Hawks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due to its artistic merit and positive mentality, which must have provided a relief to the American audience during the difficult wartime, the screwball comedy is one of the greatest achievements of the American cinema in its early days. Because the genre tends to carry various aspects of life in one story, making a Screwball Comedy masterpiece requires the craftsmanship of writers and directors. A struggle to balance one's professional life and private one, a positively depicted battle of sexes, an energetic journalism scene and its people--the director Howard Hawks masterfully interweaves these ingredients in His Girl Friday. In addition, the contribution of the celebrated actors can never be appreciated enough. For example, Cary Grant gains the viewers' laughter by his distinguished acting, while nowadays actors in numerous mediocre rom-coms can only do it with situations and deadpan humors.One small drawback is that some side characters, including Bruce Baldwin (the new fiance of Rosalind Russell's Hildy Johnson), Earl Williams (a guy who would be executed), and his girlfriend Molly Malloy, are treated dreadfully, as if they were props.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not normally a fan of Hawks, but he's done some very clever engineering here. And I'm not a Grant enthusiast, though I appreciate his sense of timing. Here, he's completely out of his element. His strength is in a laconic delay. In this case, the presentation is dependent on a crackling speed, a rush, a pushed delivery with overlapping snappy dialog. So he feels stilted, worrying too much about his delivery to be comfortable. Russell is perfect.The overlapping is in several dimensions, and that's the charm. One dimension is the overlapping dialog and intent. Another is the story (the film) about the story (the report) about the story (the murder).It is a now common trick: make three layers instead of the normal two: in this case a passionately made story about a passionately made story. Then the more the characters invest in getting into their story, the more we invest into getting into ours. That's why we dig ourself into this freight train.Be aware that there is an offensive racist joke.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>His Girl Friday is a fast talking and fast moving film on romance and journalism. Although its a hilarious screwball comedy I also felt like the film made some interesting commentary on journalism and maybe on the passions of life. The film really brings the feeling of a news room with constant rapid dialogue, always cutting each other off in a way that feels realistic, but also pushes the film forward and makes it feel much faster than it is. Although the romance is a main point of the film it does so without pushing it and having only one real sappy moment quickly pushed aside by Walter in a way that is brilliant, but also shows how nothing has really changed and Hildy has simply returned to her roots. Overall I thought the entire film was hilarious and perfectly paced to keep the film moving throughout its duration. This film may have turned me on to screwball comedies as a whole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hildy Johnson makes quite the spunky female character: independent, boisterous, take-charge. She really livens the movie up. There are some scenes to this movie which are really far-fetched. There's the scene where the lady jumps two stories to the streets below. How is she still alive? Then, there's the final scene with the murderer, where they hide him inside a desk to avoid his detection. How he managed to survive that long without air is beyond me, and even more bizarre is that when they pull him out, he's still alive, too. I would have liked to see the wedding between Hildy and her former ex-husband at the end of the movie; I can't believe he didn't take her on a Honeymoon the first time around.... Overall, well put together movie, but not without its flaws.</fullReview>

Anyway, this movie had great fluidity although at times it seemed like too much was going on. I enjoyed the characters, they give you a good idea of how newspaper journalists used to work back in the day. You learn things about the past and how things used to be through old movies such as these. The plot was great and it had several twists that you never see coming. I feel bad for the main character a little but later you learn that everything works out well. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and recommend it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was tough to follow at first because of all the dialogue but soon enough i was into it and did actually enjoy watching the whacked out relationship Walter and Hildy had. The movie is very fast paced so it wouldn't be recommended for younger viewers because the story might get confusing and the jokes might not make sense to them. Both the acting and directing of this film are both top notch work and really help pull everything together in the plot. I found it interesting that a comedy movie could dip it's toes in touchy subject matter (murder, execution, suicide) and still be funny from started to finish especially in the 1940's. The nice mixture of romantic comedy and satire help the flow of the film as do the supporting roles. Another great screwball comedy from a golden era of movie making. If you are thinking of seeing this movie stop debating on what to watch and let Howard Hanks work his magic. I almost wish Walter and Hildy had worked things out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'His Girl Friday' is a screwball comedy from 1940 directed by Howard Hawks. Based on the play 'The Front Page',Cary Grant plays Walter Burns, a completely self-absorbed newspaper editor whose primary mission is to get the story ? and get it first! The film opens with Burns having a surprise visit to the newsroom by his recent ex-wife, and ex-star reporter, Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell). With her new beau in tow, Hildy is announcing to Walter her intent to re-marry.The film then covers this one day, as the plot moves from Hildy's pending marriage, to the planned execution of a convict. As the execution nears, Burns slowly manipulates Hildy into becoming the star reporter yet again. Will Hildy's new beau survive the day? The movie is known for its crisp, rapid fire dialog, Grant and Russell often talking over each other to simulate the real-life bickering of a divorced couple. Ralph Bellamy is marvelous as Hildy's new beau, oblivious to the real plans that Burns has for Hildy. Bellamy's misfortunes add much humor to the movie as well as the stars' dialog.There are a few minor bloopers, including an unexpected costume change by Russell. Most of the filming scenes take place within newsrooms, but sets were designed based on the original play, so at times appear flat in the movie. The runtime of 92 minutes is perfect, with the dialog providing many chuckles throughout the story.</fullReview>

He also does everything he can to keep Hildy from leaving, including setting Bruce up so he gets arrested over and over again. I say this movie can almost be compared to My Man Godfery. However, this is a very fast paced film with quick lines and plenty of excitement. My favorite part is when she runs down the man in the street.

		<shortDescription>Fast-paced comedy from Howard Hawks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"His Girl Friday" is actually a remake of the 1931 film "The Front Page", which was based on a hit stage play of the same name. However, for this version the filmmakers changed the character of star reporter Hildy Johnson to a female (Rosalind Russell) and made her the ex-wife of editor Walter Burns (Cary Grant).The story opens with Johnson announcing to Burns that she intends to remarry and is leaving town with her fiancée in a matter of hours. Burns doubts that she's really serious about settling down so he lures her into covering one last story under the pretence of aiding a wrongfully condemned man.The screenplay is fast-paced and chock full of incisive wit. However, I have to take issue with the change made to the character of Hildy Johnson. To me, the romantic element seemed to be somewhat tacked on and lost in the shuffle. Then again, the unfolding of the big newspaper story didn't really do much for me either.The cast is a good one, though. Rosalind Russell is the best of the lot and she should've been nominated for an Oscar. Cary Grant's up to his usual standard and Ralph Bellamy contributed a good performance as well. Meanwhile, the remainder of the cast is well chosen and uniformly capable.In the end, the movie delivers everything I'd expect from a Howard Hawks film but the end product seems to be less than the sum of its parts. The breathless pace merely serves to mask an uninteresting plot. It has some strong points but, as a screwball comedy, it's certainly no match for "Bringing Up Baby".</fullReview>

Some pretty crazy things happened with the mans ex-wife and including Bruce getting arrested all to get him to stop his wife from leaving. Definitely a screwball comedy you don't wanna miss.

The story started to drag a little in the middle of the film, and I will admit that I started to get a little bored. Regardless, I continued to watch and there were more laughs to come at the end of the film.Overall, it is worth watching and is a fantastic film for its time.

		<shortDescription>A slice of classic screwball comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comedy just isn't done quite like this anymore. Back in the days of classic actors like Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell comedy was a much more respectable genre. In a time of such war and peril comedy was looked to as the most important film genre as it let people escape the horrors of real life, if only just for a couple of hours. Of course here I am in 2011 watching the film, so that aspect doesn't really affect me, but that's beside the point. His Girl Friday is a fun and charming story about the newspaper industry. Cary Grant plays Walter Burns who is trying to prevent his ex-wife Hildy Johnson, played by Rosaslind Russell, from remarrying. He gets his opportunity when a huge story about a falsely accused man on death row lands. He prolongs her departure from journalism allowing for all sorts of screwball antics. It's a movie you can't regret watching whether you like it or not.I should point out that I'm not the biggest fan of older comedies like this. I'm not a huge fan of comedies anyways. But I can't deny that this is a very well made film that has a lot going for it. First off, the way the dialouge works is masterful and it's something that is all but absent from modern day comedies. All the dialouge is delivered very fast and articulate. It has a very natural nonstop cadence to it. These actors deliver their lines with the utmost flawlessness, never stopping for a breath and never missing a beat. Cary Grant is obviously one of the all time greatest actors and in His Girl Friday he proves what he's worth and displays himself as a master fast talker. The other actors do just as well in their articulate delivery and it gives this film's cast an ensemble stature, and all of their talent brilliantly culminates into one magnificent final product.Today we very rarely see comedies with a point. Your average idiot comedy is good for nothing more than a chuckle so that afterwards you completely forget you ever saw the film. Back in the old days where comedy flourished, comedies had a point. His Girl Friday is not only an entertaining comedy but it serves as an interesting look into the politics and ethics of journalism. There is all sorts of lying, backstabbing, and double crossing going on in this film. It's all tongue-in-cheek of course but it is very prevalent. In some ways this film could be considered a satire of the newspaper industry. Amazingly enough, the things this film parodies are still relevant today. Scary right? And for what it's worth the story in His Girl Friday is much smarter than you would expect. It has a plethora of characters and plenty of twists and turns to keep the whole story interesting.To those who like this kind of genre in this time period this is an absolute classic. To people like me who aren't quite as interested in it, it is enjoyable but not something I would watch again. I don't regret watching the film and was mildly amused for an hour and a half, but that's the extent of it. I would highly recommend this film to anybody who likes classic cinema, screwball comedies, or Cary Grant. To those who don't, why would you consider watching this anyways?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Howard Hawks made the perfect screen comedy with 1940's "His Girl Friday", as it re-tells the tale told on stage and screen as "The Front Page". Walter Burns is a manipulative, yet charming newspaper man with an important story about to explode about an innocent man on the eve of execution. Walter's sharp-tongued and highly independent ex-wife, Hildy Johnson, has since quit the news business, but has dropped by to let him know she is remarrying the following day. The clock is ticking on the innocent man's life, as well as Walter's presumed second chance with Hildy, so what are a couple of fine talents like Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell to do but spew out their inspired and quotable dialogue out twice as fast. Equally fast-paced is the story, and the steadily building screwball chaos. This one epitomizes the title 'classic'. Highly recommend watching this one with a girlfriend or boyfriend, I did, and got lots of laughs!</fullReview>

The story is engaging with a great black comedy situation, and the script is wonderful even after about half an hour after watching you still have a smile on your face, you are quoting the dialogue and you are even laughing. The sets are limited to just two, but this limitation works, I personally think otherwise it would have distracted too much. The music is memorable too, while the direction and pacing are spot on. The acting is marvellous, for me Cary Grant has never been better and I have yet to see a movie where Rosalind Russell was as tough as she was here. All in all, brilliant film that works primarily due to the wonderful script and the amazing interplay between the leads. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is absolutely fantastic. I'm not big into Cary Grant with his romantic roles, but as Walter Burns he is pretty great. Rosalind Russell may not be a well-known actress today, but her Hildy Johnson steals the show. And Ralph Bellamy's Bruce Baldwin is also quite nice.What makes this film great? Well, besides being a good story, it is full of in-jokes and back-and-forth lines so fast it is almost hard to hear them all. When Grant refers to Baldwin as looking like Ralph Bellamy, that is hilarious. Or references to Archie Leach (his real name), among others.Russell talks so fast that she could sell Micro Machines. The way her and Grant go back and forth is just funny by itself, in the way the dialogue is delivered. Maybe not as witty as the Marx Brothers, but the pace evokes their humor.I was a bit surprised to find this is one of Quentin Tarantino's favorite films (he has lifted lines from it in "True Romance" and "Kill Bill"), but after watching it I find it hard to believe that anyone could not consider this to be a masterpiece of its era, if not still today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Front Page!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Screwball comedy is a genre, which was born in 1930's and it is one of the most interesting genres of the American film history. For those who are unfamiliar with the genre, screwballs were about fast-word persons, marriages, divorces and getting married again. To quote Andre Bazin: "Screwball is like a sex comedy without sex." That sentence has actually become the most famous description of the particular genre. Frank Capra and Howard Hawks have often seen as the pioneers of screwball. It's an endless fight, which one gets the title as the first screwball Capra's It Happened One Night (1934) and Hawks' Twentieth Century (1934). But many historians and critics tend to choose It Happened One Night as the pioneer. Frank Capra most certainly didn't stop at that he continued making several screwballs such as Mr Deeds Goes to Town (1936) and Arsenic and Old Lace (1944). But so did Howard Hawks with Bringing Up Baby (1938) and His Girl Friday (1940). It was a real fortune that this unique genre got so many brilliant stars in its films such as Gary Cooper, Cary Grant and Clark Gable.Wiring the front page was a very familiar subject for screwballs and films built around that have been made so many times that I've lost count: Mr Deeds Goes to Town, It Happened One Night etc. But His Girl Friday is truly one of the greatest. It tells the story of a newspaper editor (Grant), whose ex-wife (Russell) is getting re-married. Screwballs were always filled with sharp and fast dialog, immorality and ruthlessness. In His Girl Friday Grant's character tries the every possible trick to keep his ex-wife by his side in the middle of the case of the century.The criticism for media is an interesting thing for one to look in the history of cinema. Screwballs loved to criticize media and make fun out of it. But more "serious" film did it too for instance Scandal (1950) by Akira Kurosawa, which also deals with the postwar Japan. In His Girl Friday Hawks shows the people that they shouldn't always believe what the papers tell them. They lie, exaggerate, make things up, do the most ruthless things one could imagine and are just trying to make a living. He doesn't show reporters as inhumane monsters, but just shows the flip side of the exciting stories.His Girl Friday is a very entertaining film, it is an important part of the screwball genre, but it is also historically interesting. It was made in 1940 when WWII was going on in Europe, but the economy, politics and film industry was running wild in the States. The film could easily work as an allegory for the disregard of America, but when knowing the thoughts of Howard Hawks the possibility of that is weak, but it is an interesting perspective to approach the film. In any case it is clear that His Girl Friday is a screwball about the ruthlessness in politics and the good old marriage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>so much dialogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good film. Its not particularly well shot and its choppily edited but that doesn't matter because this is not a visual film. This is a movie that is all about the dialogue. The dialogue is so fast it pummels the viewer. Every actors timing in this had to be perfect other wise the jokes would lose their impact. Its really hard to catch everything that is said because it comes at you so fast. The story is really well done, it starts off simple enough only to take some drastic turns and venture into serious territory only to swing right back into comedy and then take a few more twists leading up to one hell of a climax. This is a film that just builds and builds, there's so much going on in every scene, its never boring. The story also tackles some heavy issues which were prevalent at the time, things like the red scare. Cary Grant plays such a delightful scumbag who's trying to con everyone into doing what he wants while Rosalind Russell plays off of Grant perfectly matching his sleazy reporter with her sarcastic witty tough girl. Ralph Bellamy is a good straight man, he really isn't given too much to do and its a rather stiff character but he does very well with what he has. The only complaints that people may have with this movie will be a few instances of mildly racist dialogue and if you are from Albany you might not take too kindly to hearing it ripped on by Cary Grant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of His Girl Friday</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was brilliant, and hilarious. Beautifully written to provide lots of humor, sparks between the characters, and wit. It is a film that will never go out of style. This film proves the continual advancements in technology for film making. The cinematography is wonderful, as the camera enhances the story line. The story line is a little fast past, if you get up for just a couple minutes you might miss something good. Delving deeper into the script, I think it was a little bit risky to portray a woman who was recently divorced, and getting married very soon after the divorce. During the 1940's, this was not as socially accepted as it is now. However, I think incorporating something like this in a film helped to strengthen women's role in society. Overall the film was just remarkable, it keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat waiting for the next witty punch line, and Walter's (Cary Grant) behavior trying to get his wife back was spectacular. Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell clearly exhibit why they are still well renowned today, their skills in front of the camera are a huge part of why the film is so great. They seem natural and comfortable, it's easy to imagine yourself in the film with them. You really couldn't ask for more in a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>His Girl Friday</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie considerably. The movie's fasted passed comedy and plot held my attention through the whole thing. Even though ninety percent of the movie takes place in the same room, His Girl Friday never gets boring. The film is hilarious. I loved how the characters spoke in the film, especially Walter. They all spoke really fast, made really witty remarks, and all spoke at the same time. It was like organized chaos and all of the actors had impeccable timing. I think my absolute favorite thing in the movie was the guy who showed up to deliver the reprieve. Everything he said was completely hilarious and was totally my style of comedy. The film is considered a screwball comedy, and rightly so, but it also has a great deal of suspense; the whole fiasco with Wilson's escape, his hiding in the desk, and everything that happens while Walter and Hildy try to get the story for themselves. As hilarious as these events are, they're also super exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat. The film also has a gripping love story. The relationship between Walter and Hildy and the love triangle with Bruce, Hildy's current fiancée, makes the film all the more fun to watch. At the end when Hildy starts to cry I at first thought she was crying from sadness at losing her fiancée, but really she was sobbing from happiness because she had learned that Walter still loved her as much as he ever did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An impeccable screwball comedy; fast-paced, witty and excellent rapid-fire dialogue. Hildy(Rosalind Russell)is an ace reporter that has divorced her ex-husband editor Walter Burns(Cary Grant)and he tries to put her back on the job to help the tabloid free a condemned man(John Qualen)from the long arm or the law. Hildy has only returned to the office to announce her whirlwind engagement to an insurance salesman(Ralph Bellamy). Burns does his best to convince Hildy to write a front-page story about the innocent man who is about to hang. Walter doesn't hide the fact he wants his ex-wife back in his arms...and oh yes, back on her old job.Director Howard Hawks is faultless in his version of the 1931 play "The Front Page". Its a hilarious slap-stick battle of the sexes. The supporting cast includes: Regis Toomey, Porter Hall, Helen Mack, Frank Jenks and Gene Lockhart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the great classics of all time. The dialog is fast, funny and smart. Plus, the gender treatment is fascinating, and not dated in the slightest. I think the movie still shows a lot of resemblance to the press today. they are all fighting and scheming to get the best story. The best part of the movie is when capture Earl Williams because each reporter has a different version of the story. Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell did a fantastic job acting in this movie. It was very fast paced, but their dialogue was quick and witty. The dialogue had to be fast because life in a newsroom is always going at 100 miles per hour. The only thing i did not care for about this movie is that you never really get to know much about the characters, you don't get inside their heads, but I think it's all part of the screwball comedy aspect of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy of Remarriage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen "The Front Page", the stage play on which "His Girl Friday" was based, or either of the two filmed versions of it from 1931 and 1974. I understand, however, that in those versions of the story the character of Hildy Johnson was male, and that when Howard Hawks made this version he originally intended to follow the original play in this respect. He eventually, however, changed his mind and made Hildy female. (At this period a "girl Friday" was a junior female office assistant; the application of the term to Hildy, an experienced journalist, is presumably ironic).Like many of the screwball comedies of this period, this one is a "comedy of remarriage". (In the same year, 1940, Cary Grant made two other films of this type, "My Favourite Wife" and "The Philadelphia Story"). The normal plot line is that the male and female leads are a divorced or separated couple who end up rediscovering their love for one another, and the attraction of this sort of story for filmmakers was that it allowed them to deal with the theme of divorce, then considered very daring and sophisticated, while providing a happy ending which would please even the most hardened moralist by showing the triumph of conjugal love. (Although the heyday of comedies of remarriage was in the thirties and forties, they have never gone away; "Bird on a Wire" and "Sweet Home Alabama" are two more recent examples).Grant here stars as Walter Burns, a newspaper editor. Hildy (in this version it's short for Hildegard) is not only his former star reporter but also his former wife. Their marriage and their business relationship have now come to an end and Hildy intends to settle down to a quiet life of domesticity with her new fiancé Bruce Baldwin, a rather dull (and none too intelligent) insurance salesman. Walter, however, asks Hildy to cover one last story for him, the execution of convicted murderer Earl Williams, and she accepts, less as a favour to her ex-husband than because she wants to help save the life of a man she believes to be innocent. Which leads to many further complications, including the inevitable discovery that Walter and Hildy are still in love with one another.Although "His Girl Friday" is primarily a romantic comedy, it does contain some satirical barbs aimed at the American newspaper industry; Hildy's idealism and concern for accuracy set her apart from most of her colleagues in the press room, who are only concerned with landing a spectacular scoop which may or may not bear any relation to the truth. On a more serious level the film also has some things to say about the death penalty and about political interference in the judicial process; the city's corrupt mayor and sheriff are anxious, for political reasons, to see Williams executed so do all they can to bring this about, even trying to bribe the messenger bringing a reprieve from the governor to go away.The film is noted for its quick- fire dialogue, particularly in the "battle of the sexes" exchanges between Walter and Hildy. It manages to pack a large amount of verbal material into a relatively short running time. One notable innovation is the use of overlapping dialogue with one character speaking before another finishes. (This technique has also been used by a number of more recent directors, such as Robert Aldrich). This development not only has the effect of making conversations sound more realistic, it also adds a greater sense of pace and rapid movement.The film also plays games with a well-worn movie convention, the convention that nobody ever notices the resemblance between a fictional character and the actor playing that character. Normally all films starring (for example) Cary Grant take place in a parallel universe in which the actor Cary Grant does not exist. Here, however, Walter describes Baldwin by saying "He looks like that fellow in the movies, you know...Ralph Bellamy!" Bellamy was, of course, the actor playing Baldwin. (This line was, apparently, an ad lib on Grant's part, but the director Howard Hawks liked it and allowed it to remain). Another film which plays a similar game is the more recent "Ocean's Twelve" in which Julia Roberts plays a character who is pretending to be Julia Roberts "because everyone says I look like her".Cary Grant had a natural gift for screwball comedy which made him the obvious choice to play Walter; Hawks had two years earlier directed him in another famous screwball, "Bringing Up Baby". Rosalind Russell, however, was not the first choice to play Hildy; that was Carole Lombard, but the studio could not afford her. Nor was she the second choice; that was Katharine Hepburn, Grant's co-star in "Bringing up Baby" and "The Philadelphia Story", but she turned the part down, as did several other actresses. Russell, however, makes the part so completely her own that it is difficult to imagine anyone else in the role, and combines well with Grant in a two-person comedy team. (I was not previously particularly familiar with Russell's work, except as the stage mother from hell in "Gypsy", so I was interested to see another side to her).I would not rank "His Girl Friday" quite as highly as "The Philadelphia Story", one of the best comedies of the period, but it is certainly better than "My Favourite Wife", a dated, sentimental film which today comes across as more cornball than screwball. It is a fast-moving, witty comedy which still stands up well today. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the Greatest of the Screwball Comedies: Possible Spoiler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the 1930's and '40s Hollywood produced a number of what came to be called "screwball comedies," farcical plots with snappy dialog executed at lightning speed. "His Girl Friday," derived from a play by Hecht and McArthur called "The Front Page," is one of the pinnacles of the genre, and Howard Hawks, the director, is among the greatest practitioners. Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are perfect in the roles of Walter Burns, the unscrupulous editor, and Hildy Johnson, his ex-wife and star reporter, reluctantly seduced into covering a pending execution gone wildly wrong. Ralph Bellamy has the role of Hildy's intended husband who "looks like Ralph Bellamy," tricked by Burns into letting her take on this "story of a lifetime." It is impossible to imagine anyone other than Grant and Russell in these parts. Each is in top form. And the result is a masterpiece of a genre that ought to be revived since it outclasses any comedies currently on display. For anyone in doubt: Grant, not Bellamy, gets the girl.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love how Howard Hawkes directed such a variety of films during his career and this was probably the funniest one. Cary Grant gives a great performance as Walter and will do whatever it takes to stop the wedding of his ex-wife. I didn't expect this film to be this funny especially since I had only seen Cary Grant in one other movie and it was a suspense film. This film is one of the concluding films for the screwball comedy genre which would eventually end in the early 1940's but as the genre expanded all of the films got funnier. This film is a must see for todays comedy fan and it is great to watch Cary Grant give a great performance in the middle of his acting career.</fullReview>

But then way towards the end I could tell that he really did care about Rosalind's character Hildy and was the only one who could handle her. When those two got into it with each other there was no stopping them. And poor Bruce he had no idea what he had gotten himself into with Hildy. And John Qualen who plays Earl William is one odd fellow in this movie. I still don't know if he committed the crime or not, he seems to sweet but then he shot a man to escape. The whole part where he was hiding in the desk was priceless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>His Girl Friday</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Howard Hawk's film His Girl Friday focuses on the wacky relationship between a woman and her ex-husband. Cary Grant, who plays Walter Burns, has an unbelievable wit and Rosalind Russell, plays Grant's ex-wife, Hildy matches this. The duologue between these two throughout the entire film is so fast paced and smart it's almost hard to keep up. It's as if each actor is always one step ahead of the other. Along with the acting, the storyline itself moves along rather quickly and doesn't give the audience time to become bored or disinterested. At first it seemed as if the plot would be solely centered around Walter breaking up Hildy's new marriage, but as it progresses a entirely different story is included in the film. The filmmakers did a wonderful job tieing the story of Earl Williams to Walter and Hildy's rocky relationship. The Earl Williams case brought a level of seriousness to the film which I think brought it to completely new level. In the beginning of the film the banter between Grant and Russell is quite funny but as the Earl Williams case is weaved in you begin to see a more serious turn to the movie. There are multiple scenes where the filmmakers tie comedy in with a bit of drama, for example at one point the sheriff is given news of Willaims reprieve by a bumbling assistant and the next scene is of Hildy being held at gun point by Earl Williams. The sets were also very well done, although most of the film is shot indoors the sets were so intricate and believable that I hadn't even noticed until the end of the film. Overall this film was very well done and each aspect whether it was the acting, directing or set design brought the film together very well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hildy is a beautiful, spunky, newspaper journalist that longs to have a normal life and get away from all the the newspaper business and her ex- husband. Hildy was set in her ways in the beginning, but throughout the movie became more involved in the hot murder story of Earl William. This film and Hildy's life is great for the audience to watch and experience because many people have become torn between two things in their life whether it had to do with two possible love interest or two job opportunities. If she would have chosen Bruce she would of possibly had a lot easier life, stress free normal life, but let face it sometimes we the audience don't want that life. As far as the film,their wasn't much movement of change in the types of shots, but it did well for with the action that was going on and felt as if you were there in the room along with them. The anxiety towards the end when Bruce is trying to get Hildy's attention was a great scene because of the amount of rambling and typewriting going on. The scenes felt cleverly put together and easy to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Howard Hawkes creates a free for all frenzy of Love and Comedy upon The viewer and has you crying in your seat for the length of the movie. He does this by using fast-paced dialogue and constant change of character which is truly impressive for it's time. The match of Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell meshed so well that you fall in love with what's going on in the movie. Hawkes draws you in by using all the surroundings to keep your mind consistently flowing from scene to scene and uses different characters to bring about different feelings and emotions that fill you up with ideas about what my just happen next. The best way Hawke showed this was when Hildy came back to the news office and told Walter she would be quitting the business and settling down with some handsome lad. This causes Burns to take action and sets off a firestorm of events that leads to an unpredictable turn of events.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grant and Russell Shine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A splendid remake of the play, The Front Page, but significantly altered. It stars a snarky newspaper man in Walter Burns (played by Cary Grant), and the woman in question now being played by Rosalind Russell, as Hildy. Burns wants his old wife Hildy back, and will do anything to stop her new wedding from happening.This is what sets off the rest of the movie. It paints Russell's character Hildy as strong and self-serving, something not normally seen in that era of movies. She does however have the typical "moment of breakdown" however it lasts briefly and its at the end of the movie. She has undeniable chemistry with Grant's character, and it shows in any scene they have together. Especially with the director apparently promoting ad-libbing, them being able to play off of each other for their snappy, back-and-forth deliveries gives some of the best comedy in the movie.The film itself bends gender stereotypes, even though Hildy pushes Grant's jackass of a character (but somehow charming) away the entire movie, but Burns still pulls her back in at the end. After all, all the girls want to end up with the bad boys. The movie starts Hildy's perceived need to settle down, but the hustle and bustle of the old journalistic lifestyle keeps calling her back, and Burns' undeniable charm, plus a shared experience always creates some sort of spark, for instance, being arrested together.Meanwhile, her future husband Baldwin is painted as a dolt caught in another man's old desires, and is constantly being harassed in some form or another, being arrested twice. It's supposed to be funny, but it actually comes off more tragic because all this guy wanted was to get married to Hildy. A funny, snappy movie, but muddled in a dystopian message.</fullReview>

Walter does whatever he can to keep Hildy to write on the paper even though she is suppose to be getting married. But by him doing this it makes her realize how much she loves writing for the paper. I like that at the end of the movie they almost end up going to jail because they were hiding a fugitive. But as this happens they find out that the mayor and sheriff were suppose to let this man go cause they got papers that said so and they didn't want anything to do with it. So they end up not going to jail but at the end they had a great story to write about in the paper. Hildy ends up getting back with Walter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Okay Film to Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody loves a film that's constantly filled with suspense,romance, adventure, and drama. Romantic couples are constantly finding new ways to fall in love with their loved ones or their ex partners,such as playing tricks on their partner's other romantic lover just to get their original partner to fall in love with them again.Sometimes,the male or the female would have to go out of their way to make sure that their partner don't have any feelings for anybody else so that way, they can keep their romantic life to themselves. Lies and tricks are horrible ways to get people to like or dislike you or put people in slander. Only when the truth comes out does romance and friendship become pure and faithful, and the couple will like each other for who they are.The filming and lighting in this film had gotten more advanced and better in 1940. There were a lot more panning in and out of the main characters with dramatic lighting on their faces that would create suspense and dramatize the scene. There was more cast shadows and reflected lights that almost looked as if they were created by real natural light on the wall, in a few scenes. The movement from scene to scene was more fluid and moved at a fast pace to give the film a more dramatic feel and make it more frantic and conveying the urgency of the character's actions and motives in the film, especially the news that was being shown throughout the movie within the narrative. The comedy was brought to a standstill throughout most of the film, except for a few awkward scenes with Grant, Johnson, and Baldwin.The comedy that was briefly showed flowed well through the film in a dialogue realistic manner. The acting in this movie was excellent. The narrative and plot of the film jumped around too much between the romance issues, the lying, and the main focus of the story that needed to be simplified into one main narrative that could have been easier to follow.Either than that, it was an okay film to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the fastest moving films I have ever seen, His Girl Friday is relentless in its action and pace, yet never feels to rushed or contrived for its own advantage. Adapted from a play by the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, director Howard Hawks changed the second lead to a female, centered the story more on the hustle and bustle of journalism and a success was born.Of course it helps that the two stars were Cary Grant, arguably the greatest of all comedic actors in early Hollywood, and Rosalind Russell, an actress borrowed from another studio but may very well be the only one who could have pulled this part off. The dialog also works as something of true genius. Charles Lederer adapted the play, but it is really Hawks that deserves the credit as he was open to allowing virtually any type of spontaneous idea or improvisation to further improve the story. Here, I am sure there were countless instances and it works seemingly every time.Here is a film that is a great success and it isn't all just one person. Hawks directs furiously and paces so well, fitting in just what we need to understand exactly what is going on, Grant and Russell have wonderful chemistry and can handle the rapid-fire dialog, and all the supporting characters pitch in as well and do a marvelous job, particularly Ralph Bellamy as the boring fiancé who even allows an in-joke at his expense. This is a modern comedy without the unnecessary vulgar and obscene language or crude jokes. It is people talking as fast as they can trying to get their opinion in. It is a great experience and an ageless comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once in a while you see a movie that's so jaw-droppingly perfect in all departments that just reminiscing about it drives tears of happiness to your eyes. Howard Hawks's black comedy "His Girl Friday" is part of that pantheon.Never again was a Hollywood mainstream comedy bleaker and more cynical in its characterizations (without resorting to condescension and moralizing), never again was (party overlapping) comedy dialogue so brilliantly written and delivered with such speed, never again was a comedy plot (with tragic overtones) told with such economy and perfect timing, never again were Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant (and the whole bunch of great supporting actors and actresses) funnier and wittier. Never ever will a timeless masterpiece such as this be outclassed.Sorry, I have to go and watch it again while drying my eyes.10 out of 10 unscrupulous headlines</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious film that deserves a watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rather than posting a bit of the synopsis, although I might reference some scenes and such, I just want to say: ANYONE WHO ADORES COMEDIES, PARTICULARLY SCREWBALLS SHOULD WATCH THIS. I really loved it although I'm not sure if there was much chemistry between Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell. Like most screwballs I've watched, this one also sets place in a newspaper publisher (The Morning Post), which already sets up the stage for people talking over each other and quick dialogue. Russell is Hildegaard (Hildy), the ex-wife of Grant, who is Walter Burns the editor of The Morning Post, and of course, it's obvious that Walter is going to try to get Hildy back. And like most screwballs, Hildy already has another man! While the story is quite predictable, it's the acting on Russell's end and sometimes Grant's that makes this film great. I knew what was going to happen, but the quick dialogue is what kept me watching. I could have cared less about the whole newspaper story, but I couldn't keep my eyes off of Russell. Grant had some great moments when he would make these weird groaning/moaning noises that were perfect for the scene. Ralph Bellamy plays Bruce, and of course, he is the guy Hildy is going to marry, but if you've watched some screwballs, you probably know what happens to Bruce in the end. There was a great line when Walter tells one of his assistants to find Bruce and when he describes Bruce, he says, "He looks like that fellow in the movies - Ralph Bellamy." I should be on the look out for more movie references in screwballs since I noticed one in Bringing Up Baby as well. It was nice to see Ralph Bellamy again since I saw him in The Awful Truth as well and he pretty much played the same character, which made me chuckle a bit. And how could I not mention Howard Hawks in this post, right? For those who don't know, Hawks is a well-known director by film buffs and has directed numerous famous films. Maybe you know him as the director of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (you know, the film with Marilyn Monroe singing "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"!) but let me tell you, he has never disappointed me with any of his films. I loved how he used some subtleties like in a scene when Hildy, Bruce, and Walter are at a restaurant and with the things they ordered and their actions, it was as if it was foreshadowing the ending of this film. First it starts with Walter deciding what he'll get and Hildy simply saying that she'll get the same, and Bruce kind of goes with it as well. Then both Hildy and Walter take out cigarettes and when Hildy lights a match, Walter simply drags Hildy's match over to his cigarette and Hildy gives him a look of annoyance and then lights her own cigarette. I noticed that Bruce didn't smoke in the scene and then Walter orders coffee with rum and Hildy gets the same thing, but Bruce says that he doesn't want it. After watching the film, I realized that the scene (the one I just mentioned) was the film in a nutshell. At the beginning, it all appears to be that the three characters are on an equal plane, yet it is Walter who orders first in a forceful voice and when Hildy orders the same in a simple manner, it was as if ordering the roast beef sandwich was something they usually did and was nothing new to her. Then when they both start smoking and Walter doing the thing he does with the match, it's like bringing Walter and Hildy together and finally with the coffee, it is solidifying the bond between Walter and Hildy while Bruce is in the outskirts. Well, that's just my interpretations of things, but I thought that Hawks directed that scene and the rest of the film incredibly well. I highly suggest that you watch this film if you're up for a good laugh. The DVD I had was by some company called D3K or something and the transfer was HORRIBLE so if you plan to buy the DVD, don't buy the one from them.FILM BLOG - http://sachlichkeit.net</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think there are three versions of this play kicking around out there and this one is the best, not to mention the fastest.The director, Howard Hawks, was always good at light comedy, improvising gags on the spot and taking all sorts of liberties with the script. Sometimes the plot got lost along the way ("The Big Sleep") but he was always a superb story teller.Hildy Johnson, Rosalind Russell, is an ace reporter about to marry a dull insurance salesman, Ralph Bellamy, but her editor wants to keep her on the paper. Cary Grant couldn't have been a better choice for the role of Walter Burns, Hildy Johnson's editor. He's handsome and roguish and lies with every breath he takes.Hawks rewrote the play. In the original, Hildy was a man but Hawks, who never quite got his gender roles straight, heard a talk-through and decided it would be more interesting if Hildy were a woman. And that enabled the writers to introduce the jealousy element, which wouldn't have fit the original story unless we're talking homoeroticism.I felt kind of sorry for Ralph Bellamy's character. Even his name -- Bruce Baldwin -- sounds like the noise a foot might make when it's being pulled from sludge. The poor guy is earnest, sincere, highly principled, and lives with his mother in Albany. He's the kind of man that every woman in the 1930s wanted to build a home with -- a beastly impulse in itself -- only they'd have to get rid of mother first. Ground glass in the Pablum perhaps.That mother is a real pain in the neck too. She's supposed to accompany them on the overnight train to Albany and travel with them on their honeymoon. Burns traps the feisty old lady into some contretemps and tells his goon, Louie, "Take her down to Polack Mike's and tell the cops she was plastered," or something like that.Try putting a line like that into a politically correct movie today. Polack Mike's. Notwithstanding the fact that the Polish word for Polish people is "polaki." The movie rises into the surreal once in a while. The assembled reporters, when they're not playing poker in the press room, speak in headlines. They call their editors with stories that can't possibly be printed. If additional guards will be placed around the scaffold during Earl Williams' hanging, the lead is "Sheriff just adds new family members to city payroll." Roger Ebert, a Chicago newsman himself, took some pleasure in seeing how much things had changed since the 1920s, but the change was to be expected. The eternal verities aren't very eternal when you get right down to it. When I was a kid, every car looked like it had been made in 1939, the mass was said in Latin, and you could supposedly look up girls' dresses by covertly glancing at their patent leather shoes. Now -- it's all changed. And where did it go? (Sob.) Kleenex, please. Thank you.What an enjoyable and funny movie this is. Oh, it creaks at the joints, but that's to be expected because it's so old. It's like Cary Grant talking Ralph Bellamy into writing out Grant's insurance policy with Rosalind Russel as the beneficiary. Bellamy objects a bit because he wants to provide for her all by himself. But what if he can't? "Can't you just imagine Hildy when you're gone? Sitting on the porch swing? Old lace and lavender?" Bellamy says dreamily, "Yes, I can." Grant stands back and snaps, "She's OOOOLD, isn't she!" I can't stop laughing at the irreverence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Quintessential Slapstick Classic Extraordinarily Comfortable In Its Own Skin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This guy here loves His Girl Friday. The reason is because it is extraordinarily comfortable in its own skin: Howard Hawks and the characters are all operators. They can't sit still, all the time determined to gel the wheels of their countless devices and schemes into action. This has to be the most urbane film of the classic screwball comedies, Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, both in their very top comic form, playing a tough, cynical editor and a star reporter with their ears forever to the ground and their fingers on the pulse of fashionable social drifts and developments. The ideal insiders, they gain access to whatever scene, privileged or specialized that occur to their whims: Russell forming chummy alliances, Grant ringleading, and ever living by their own arrays of convention. They have the souls and mouths of a Dashiell Hammett or an Allen Ginsberg from an older generation, so they have gravitated toward media-driven vocations, those steeped in the commercial exchange of ideas, which brings them into contact with an ever-revolving cast of characters. In scarce flashes of downtime, they still pine for activity, painting the town red with cliquey associations.Hawks can step to one side and psychologically react to things from both slants at once. He grasps impressions and information, simultaneously conveying his own messages and agenda. Interaction is what it's all about for Hawks, a master of commerce, communication, and all such exchange.Russell traverses a thin edge between inherent liability and an uncompromising need to claim her own agenda both professionally and in her personal life. She is very conscious of her womanly charm, utilizing them to her best benefit, playing coy or bright so as to win the affection of men and win position. No other woman around her generates more commotion. Russell does not play a laid-back or even very considerate character, her presence running entirely on nervous energy. She's able to gain the greatest triumphs on top of finding herself in the severest predicaments. She puts everything into keeping count of any ambition.I'm stunned to find that Russell herself is not as iconic as this character of hers, if not cyclonic: She leaves every situation, and every person involved, tainted following her involvement. When it comes to her regretted past marriage to Grant, she had thrown herself into the situation the same way she does with all of them, out of an alternating need to indulge desire and impose dominance, letting herself be swept away by curiosity. Now however, much to the chagrin of Grant, she is touching down and planning to settle into an accepting marriage with Ralph Bellamy, as always playing a meek, bland cornball romantic, with whom she may safely swing between her two distinct personalities, helpless baby doll and ruthless boss.Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, who wrote the original play, and more immediately the screenwriter Charles Lederer, are acutely cognizant of mental mechanics. They think, and they are masters of mind games, for the sake of our amusement as well as putting the wheels of the lightning-paced plot in motion and pulling out all the stops too, but the incidental appearance of a hilariously reactive and zealous fat man. His Girl Friday is undoubtedly one of the greatest comedies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than Most Comedies Today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>His Girl Friday is a classic that still holds water today. Howard Hawks delivers an adaptation of Ben Hecht's play, The Front Page, that is funnier and more fine tuned than most comedies today. This film's influence is still felt today with movies like Clerks and Pulp Fiction with their quick and witty dialogue.From the beginning, this film will hypnotize you with its ultra fast dialogue. The exchanges seems so meticulously rehearsed and prepared. Characters hit their lines with complete perfection and air-tight pace. There is probably ten seconds in the whole film where nothing is being said. This masterful use of dialogue can easily be credited to director Hawks, but it is the performance of Cary Grant that drives this film. He plays a corrupt, immoral, and unethical newspaper editor who forces us to like him. The entire film shows us how evil a newspaper can be but it shows us from their point of view. This enables us to empathize with Cary Grant and his staff. They lie to and set up Bruce Baldwin. That should make us dislike them and position them as the villains of the film. However, Cary Grant's performance is so engaging that we end up admiring the level of power he has and the intelligence he displays. He takes what would be a villain in most movies and makes him likable. He almost acts as a lawyer or politician with how slick he is. His upbeat delivery of lines and dry humor show the dialogue in another light, from his point of view. His intentions are to serve his newspaper and his ex-wife, Hildy. This film should be re-released today so people can see what real comedy is. Not just some random and pointless comment that makes no sense we can't help but laugh. That seems to be what comedy is today (Family Guy, Dane Cook, Seth Rogen, etc.). His Girl Friday is a smart comedy with relevant jokes that build character.Go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just simply one of the best comedies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell), a newspaper reporter, is quitting her job at the paper to get married to nice, sweet but dull Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy). He ex-husband, and head of the paper, Walter Burns (Cary Grant) doesn't want her to go. She's the best reporter they have and he'll do anything to keep her.VERY quick and absolutely hilarious comedy. One-liners fly fast and furious and the story moves like lightning. Russell and Grant play very well off each other and are at their peak. Bellamy is given a thankless role but is as good as he can be. The rest of the cast are made up of character actors from the era who are just great. Director Howard Hawks always keeps the camera moving. This was originally a stage play (called "The Front Page") but he opens it up. This was based on a play in which Hildy was a man but they change him into a her and it works. This has been filmed multiple times but this remains the best version. Quick, funny and just great. A must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite possibly, the funniest film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter Burns (Cary Grant) is a smooth (and fast)-talking, amoral newspaper reporter who will do literally anything for a story. Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) is Walter's snappy ex-wife, who is threatening to retire from the newspaper business and settle down with Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy), a well-meaning, mild-mannered sap. Walter's quest to prevent Hildy from leaving the paper reaches ridiculous extremes, as death row inmate Earl Williams (John Qualen) breaks out of prison. As the police hunt Williams, Walter draws Hildy back into the business - leaving poor Bruce taking the fall for everything. It all builds, of course, to a ridiculous, over-the-top, feverish climax, as Walter and Hildy are hiding Williams from the police, the Mayor (Clarence Kolb), and, perhaps more importantly, from their fellow journalists."His Girl Friday" is the epitome of the screwball comedy - the genre of rapid-fire dialog and misunderstandings which snowball to gigantic proportions. And what a film it is. A fabulous cast and amazing script propel this flick to stratospheric heights. Its amazingly fast-paced jokes, lovable cynicism, fabulous cast, and overall outrageousness make for a hilarious combination. I can't think of a single comedy I've enjoyed more than this film.The film contains an extremely cynical outlook on the world. The depiction of journalism is either flattering or damning, depending on your point of view. On the one hand, we see journalists depicted as scheming, conniving, amoral jerks, who will literally do anything to get a story - including manipulating and trampling everyone else. Walter of course devotes everything he has to winning Hildy back - including legally dubious methods - and get the big scoop, which for once may be complimentary motives. The murderer, Earl Williams, and his alleged "sweetheart" Molly are used as pawns by everyone - the journalists eager for a story, and the politicians hoping to get re-election. This isn't even to mention poor hopeless Bruce, who finds himself the butt of everything that's going on. On the other hand... can we really fault them? After all, Cary Grant and Rosalind Russel are so witty, snappy, and sexy that it's impossible to side against them. And hey, the politicians are doing it too - and who can side with the ineffectual Sheriff or the scheming Mayor, with an even more callous disregard for human life? It's a dog-eat-dog world, and when everybody is a jack-off (or a helpless loser), side with the cool guys.Hawks' direction is marvelous; the film isn't visually astounding, although the use of shadows in the jail and courtyard scenes are effective, but his handling of the actors and story are extraordinary. Hawks and writer Charles Lederer also make a great improvement over the source material (the play "The Front Page" by Charles MacArthur and Ben Hecht) by making Hildy a woman. This seems like a minor difference at first, but it unquestionably enhances the chemistry and relationship between the two actors, making Walter's manipulation of Hildy more urgent and endearing. All other considerations aside, you have to give His Girl Friday at least one point: This is undoubtedly THE fastest-talking movie of all time. Charles Lederer's script is filled with endless zingers, comebacks, and wit - along with amusing ad-libs (mostly by Cary Grant - you know the ones). And the actors are absolute naturals at it. This kind of humor makes modern comedies like "The 40 Year Old Virgin", "Meet the Parents", and even "The West Wing" (its closest modern counter-part) look lame in comparison.Cary Grant is an old hand at this genre (Arsenic and Old Lace, Bringing Up Baby) and his Walter Burns is a wonderful character, obnoxious yet charming throughout. His motives would be sweet if it weren't for the situation - and the methods. Rosalind Russel matches him quip for quip as the extremely sexy "modern woman" Hildy. The whole supporting cast is fabulous. Ralph Bellamy makes the sad-sack Bruce an endearingly honest fall guy. John Qualen as the criminal and Helen Mack as his "girlfriend" contribute amusing characters, who find themselves trapped in the ridiculous webs of journalism and politics. The whole supporting cast - Gene Lockhart as the inept Sheriff, Abner Biberman as Walter's pickpocket buddy, Martha Kern as Bruce's beleaguered mother, and Porter Hall, Ernest Truex, and Cliff Edwards (among others) as journalists - are fabulous. If even one actor were off their game, this film wouldn't work - but everyone down to the extras is fabulous.In conclusion... what more can there be to say? His Girl Friday is perhaps THE greatest comedy of all time. See it, laugh your ass off, lather, rinse, repeat. You won't regret it.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sex Change for 'Hildy' and Rapid Fire, the Step Over Dialogue ratcheting the Laughs higher and more frequent, even!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1928-29 season on Broadway, the Ben Hecht-Charles MacArthur collaboration of THE FRONT PAGE was performed for 276 times. Soon thereafter, Hollywood Beckoned and the movie houses were doing a good business in the filmed version of THE FRONT PAGE (Caddo Company/United Artists, 1931). The film has a quite distinguished pedigree; what with Producer Howard Hughes, Director Lewis Milestone and co-stars Adolph Menjou, Pat O'Brien, Mary Brian, Edward Everett Horton, Mae Clark, George E. Stone and a fine group all turning in excellent and properly cynical, yet humorous performances. This was not to be the only version, though, as Tinsel Town would return to the well frequently.Once again as THE FRONT PAGE (Universal, 1974), the story was filmed; but this time it was the creative team of Director Billy Wilder and "the Odd Couple" of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. Additionally, no less than four times (Count 'em folks, 4!); it was adapted for the TV audience. The small screen brought us versions in 1945, 1948, 1949 (As a TV Series, yet!) and in 1970.But the story has much more to it. A reworking of the Premise from being about the Newspaper Racket to the running of a Central American Banana Plantation was the basis for TORRID ZONE (Warner Brothers, 1940); which co-starred James Cagney, Anne Sheridan and Pat O'Brien. This time it was Pat in Walter Burns-type boss role, instead of his being the patsy.A "modern" and updated version transforms the whole scene to the Electronic Media, substituting a Cable News Channel for the "STOP THE PRESSES" Newsprint world in SWITCHING CHANNELS (Tri-Star Pictures, 1988); which Starred Kathleen Turner, Burt Reynolds and Christopher Reeve. This version was Directed by Ted Kocheff. It was different media; but the same old stuff.Now as to Today's Featured Feature Film Festivities, we present, the Star of the Show, Director Howard Hawks' HIS GIRL Friday (Columbia, 1940); which many consider to be the best FRONT PAGE filmed version or adaptation. The story is essentially the same; but there are a couple of major roadblocks thrown in just to make things interesting. Quite simply, they made 'Hildy' a nickname for Hildagard, instead of Hildebrand; then they made the Walter Burns and Hildy Johnson characters into Man &amp; Wife, or more precisely newly divorced Ex-spouses! The rest of the plot is the same. Managing Editor Walter Burns (Mr. Grant) tries to prevent his best reporter, Hildy Johnson (Miss Russell) into staying on to cover the top story of the day. And that story would be the pending execution of an apparently mentally disturbed Cop Killer, one Earl Williams (John Qualen). The seemingly simple premise becomes a most fast moving, breathtakingly paced farce as seen on the Silver Screen.The outstanding performances in the film, and they are many, should be recognized at this time; so then we shall. Beside the Co Stars of Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell we must consider Ralph Bellamy (Bruce Baldwin), Gene Lockhart (Sherriff Peter Hartwell), Frank Orth (Editor Duffy), Helen Mack (Mollie Molloy) and Abner Biberman ("Diamond Louie") all turn in true character performances. Clarence Kolb (the Mayor) and Billy Gilbert (Joe Pettibone, Reprieve Currier) provide the sort of interplay that one would expect from a pair of top-flight Vaudevillians; which, of course, they were! Rounding out this little "Recognition Ceremony" of ours is the group who portrayed "the Gentlemen of the Press", that is the guys camped out in the Press Room at the Jail who await the execution of Earl Williams. That great little group of fast-talking', wise-crackin' men of literature was made up of Ernest Truex (Bensinger), Porter Hall (Murphy), Cliff Edwards (Endicott), Roscoe Karns (McCue) and Regis Toomey (Sanders).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Howard Hawks made the perfect screen comedy with 1940's "His Girl Friday", as it re-tells the tale told on stage and screen as "The Front Page". Walter Burns is a manipulative, yet charming newspaper man with an important story about to explode about an innocent man on the eve of execution. Walter's sharp-tongued and highly independent ex-wife, Hildy Johnson, has since quit the news business, but has dropped by to let him know she is remarrying the following day. The clock is ticking on the innocent man's life, as well as Walter's presumed second chance with Hildy, so what are a couple of fine talents like Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell to do but spew out their inspired and quotable dialogue out twice as fast. Equally fast-paced is the story, and the steadily building screwball chaos. This one epitomizes the title 'classic'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the very best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually hate "remakes," particularly remakes that screw around with the story. MacArthur and Hecht wrote their play, "The Front Page," about a newspaperMAN, Hildebrandt Johnson, and his relationship with his BOSS. Turning "Hildy," into "Hilda," and throwing into the reporter-editor relationship the complication that they are ex-spouses who are still in love (sort of), seems sappy.Yet, this is the exception. Having seen several versions of the original "Front Page," including the Pat O'Brien/Adolphe Menjou film and the later Jack Lemmon/Walter Matthau movie, I feel that the Rosalind Russell/Cary Grant "His Girl Friday" edition is in fact a huge improvement. The romantic subplot doesn't distract, it truly enhances the fun, and wit, and cynical sharpness, and allows Ralph Bellamy (the would-be new husband) to really get to join the comedy. Of all the adaptations of the play, this one is truly the wittiest, quickest, most rollicking, without losing the moments of darkness that do show up in the play.Don't miss the tiny gems: Cary Grant referring to a story about a suicide, Archie Leach (Grant's birth name); Grant telling "Bruce" that he looks like "that fellow, what's his name, Ralph Bellamy"; Billy Gilbert, John Qualen, and Gene Lockhart (as Sheriff Peter "pinky" "B for Brains" Hartwell) turning in perfect little performances in lesser parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We have recently begun to view movies made before we were born. What a pleasant surprise. I had no idea how present-centric we were. There are so many delightful movies from the 40's and 50's. I would give anything to see a current movie with the kind of snappy dialogue that His Girl Friday had. It is also interesting to note the cultural norms of the day. Rosiland Russell plays a no nonsense reporter who is the equal of her former husband and newspaper editor, Cary Grant. The movie is interesting for the use of a "battle of the sexes" theme that is actually a courtship ritual for a woman who is a independent as Russell. But I was amazed at the use of the term picaninny to describe a black child. I was incredulous that there was absolutely no music to heighten the emotional scenes. Says a lot about directing and writing in those days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of the greatest films are converted plays, and this is no exception. Probably the greatest example of cynical dialog ever filmed. The writing is superb, masterfully crafting a battle of jibes between two great actors. The other characters of the play, the story and setting, all seem of little importance to the rapid fire exchange between Grant and Russell. The speed, timing, and wit of the film are first rate. The speed of delivery is enough to make the dialog in West Wing seem like a slow tugboat ride to China. If you are in the film or theater biz you need to buy it, trust me. It amazing how casually the actors pull off the comic timing, you'll find yourself watching it again many times just to catch all the hyper-speed jokes. It definitely deserves a place in the top 50 films of our history if not the top twenty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Howard Hawks directs this fast-paced screwball comedy at a such a brisk, breath-taking pace that it's a wonder the actors related so intimately to all the dialog. But they do--and ROSALIND RUSSELL, CARY GRANT and RALPH BELLAMY are about as perfectly cast as they ever have been in this sort of romp.The plot has Grant doing everything within his power to keep Russell on his newspaper as his top reporter and also everything he can to break up the romance between Bellamy and Russell when he finds out she's about to marry the screen's favorite "other man". At one point in the screenplay, he tells a blonde moll to look for the man in the taxicab who looks like that movie actor--you know, Ralph Bellamy. Another quip has him bringing up the name of Archibald Leach, another inside joke for those in the know.Russell is the mistress of fast dialog and has a role that is way over the top, a parody of a fast-talking newspaper woman if ever there was one. She, Grant and Bellamy have a delicious scene early in the film where Grant is treating them to lunch after she breaks the news of her engagement. The interaction between these three stars as they prepare to lunch together is the ultimate in timing and comic interplay between three pros.As screwball comedies go, this is one of the best. The overlapping dialog may be a bit too much at times, but still the concept works because of the impeccable acting credentials of the entire cast.Well worth watching for the performances alone. Cary and Roz and Ralph are at their comic peak.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is way too much dialogue for this film. That is certainly not a bad thing. There is enough dialog for films 4 times as long, and yet all of it fits perfectly into this film because of Hawks' precision direction and the fabulous acting. Hawks finds a way to include all the dialog without making it confusing or tedious. He establishes a very tight flow for all that is going on. I almost felt out of breath at the conclusion. The actors do a superb job of not merely reciting their lines, but reacting to each other, vocally and physically. One could almost watch this movie without sound and still follow the interplay. The subtle body language and facial expressions are as perfectly timed and choreography as anything else. I really enjoyed that this wasn't just a wacky comedy. Underneath the flashy surface is a very direct satirical commentary. This film makes a strong statement on the cutthroat mentality of the press and their skewed method of reporting the "facts". The reporters don't actually deal with facts; they spew out opinions disguised as facts. The state of the press is not much different today. None of the characters are very appealing. They are either jackals or pansies. It is easy to forget that with all the witty banter. I think this is a highly entertaining, very insightful film. Top notch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie does move really fast, and I'm a fan of that kind of movie. It's hilarious and Clark Gable is amazing. Plus I love some of the things the movie says about society with its criminal, boring husband from Albany, and dumb police force. I watched this for an American cinema class and thoroughly enjoyed it, and while it's not for those who can;t take a fast paced movie, it's not a bad movie in the least and might even deserve to be rated higher in my opinion.And the race issue...isn't really that big of a deal in this movie. Comparing this to Birth of a Nation is like comparing Plan 9 to Star Wars...they aren't that similar. I didn't even notice the black face, and I'm one who tends to notice such things.All things told, it's a pretty good film. I'd highly recommend it, especially to Gable and Noir lovers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and dive in. From beginning to end, this film never lets up, shaking, rattling and rolling the viewer as each member of the cast tries to get their two cents into the mix before someone shouts them down. For once Grant is the conniver, not the connivee and how he does plot. No matter the setbacks to his ambitions, he has an answer to his desire to avoid losing his Hildy, and getting the story at the same time. Russell is his complete equal, barking back at him in spades, drowning him out at times. What a pair. Ralph Bellamy never has a chance. And the self-references: Grant noting that the last man who said something to him was Archibald Leach, or sending Louis out to look for Bruce, who looks like Ralph Bellamy.Reading on this board, I see many object to the humor of a man jumping out a window, or heading for the electric chair, but compared to modern use of cartoon violence, such as in Get Shorty, these episodes do not change the tone of the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>His Girl Friday: Howard Hawks direction is close to perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to a book, Hawks was a director who narrated in simple strait forward pictures without getting advanced or complicated. However, as the case with "The Big Sleep", Hawks shows in "His Girl Friday" that he is a superb director, easy and uncomplicated story-telling/ narration or not. The first scene is done with an amazing camera work and a cutting in the dialogs that still isn't surpassed. Rating: 8 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cary Grant stars in this film. Is there anything else that needs to be said? Grant plays the former husband of newspaper reporter Russell. It is of course a romantic comedy, but one that is hilarious even today. The chemistry and dialogue between Grant and Russell rings genuine. Besides the romance, and the comedy, is the commentary the film makes about newspaper reporting and reporters. The key to this film is listening. This is not a popcorn picture where you can make comments to your viewing companions. If you talk you'll miss half of the jokes. So keep quiet and enjoy. Also Grant makes references to himself in a typically funny scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Too bad I got a really old video of this one. The picture quality was fuzzy and the sound kept going up and down and up and down. Well, at least I could hear a majority of the dialogue, cheifly Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant's witty repartee, smoothly carried out amid all the lunacy, and all sorts of breakneck, snappy one-liners emitting from said lunacy. There must have been more in between, only I was too busy laughing and trying to figure everything out. After a while, everything goes so fast you hardly remember a bit of it; in fact, you hardly remember hearing most of the details in the story that everyone keeps talking about. But it's still funny! In fact, it keeps you at the edge of your seat in some spots! How a movie can do that, I will never figure out. Sure, it's a classic. Doesn't quite match Howard Hawks' other screwball comedy, Bringing Up Baby, which also has Cary Grant and lunacy, but it sure comes close! I just hope it's been re-released on a much-better quality video and DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The combination of Grant, Russell, Bellamy and Hawks produces one of the alltime classic comedies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is perhaps Cary Grant's funniest film (I'd rank it a hair behind "Arsenic and Old Lace") The rat-a-tat dialogue has rarely been so perfectly timed as between he and Rosalind Russell, who delivers the definitive caricature of a 1930's career gal. And Ralph Bellamy's hamhanded nice guy was so effective that his name became synonymous with that type of role. Amazing that he was ever taken seriously afterwards. The writing is superb, better than most any dialogue you'll hear today. And Howard Hawks directs the whole shebang at just the right pace and tone to keep it all together.The story is pretty simple. Russell is Grant's ex, and she's come back to see him at the newspaper he edits and she used to write for to inform him that she's getting remarried (to Bellamy) Whew! Meanwhile, Grant decides to win her back at the last minute, sucking her back into the newspaper game by tricking her into covering the last day of a man on death row. Can't tell you what happens, you'll have to watch for yourself.If this all sounds a bit familiar, but you know you haven't seen it, there were several other filmed versions of the play this was based on, "The Front Page". The Matthau/Lemon version was okay, but avoid the painfully unfunny 80's version, "Switching Channels" with Kathleen Turner and that Superman fella.Veddy veddy funny. It makea me laugh. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

The film comedy was elevated to new heights with Howard Hawks outstanding direction. Based on the classic play "The Front Page", Hawks gives it a delightful twist by presenting Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant as an estranged couple of newspaper journalists who haven't quite written the final line of their love story. Ralph Bellamy is great as the beleaguered as strait-laced Bruce Baldwin who is the perfect comic victim of Grant's devious deals to get Russell back. Everyone who has ever enjoyed a comedy from "Airplane" to "Blazing Saddles" owes a debt to this movie.It's an AMC cable channel staple, and rightfully so. It's a 9 1/2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was great! It showed a different style of comedy than most of the screwball comedies out there. The actors were more sarcastic and quick witted than in other movies I had seen in this category before. Not only did I love the quick smart remarks between the newly divorced couple, I found it great at the pace that the movie moved at. It was fast but perfect at the same time because the audience was still able to follow along with ease.What was different about this movie, in which I found interesting, was they showed women in a more dominant, independent light. Movies previously to this portrayed women in a damsel in distress and less independent light. For instance, Hildy's character is always shown taking charge of every situation she gets in, calling the shots and not letting men walk all over her. Though she is still sexy and classy it's more powerful and more positive for women.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pefect movie, top to bottom, sideways, and beyond the gallows...AMAZING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>His Girl Friday (1940)This is, in a way, another great 1939 film, filmed and copyrighted that year but not released until January 1940. But never mind that, His Girl Friday is maybe the best of that very cinematic genre, the screwball comedy. Oh, there are other great ones--My Man Godfrey and Bringing Up Baby, certainly, and two slightly less zany ones, Philadelphia Story and of course the one that started it all, It Happened One Night. But just listen to the perfect pitch writing and the even more perfect delivery by the two leads, the always astonishing Cary Grant and the even more astonishing Rosalind Russell. But wait, every single actor is on target here, and the delivery of every hilarious line is so compacted and intense, yet so brilliantly ordered and edited, you end up bowing down before the man pulling this all together, none other than Howard Hawks. Even the camera-work is fast and makes this chaos look completely reasonable, from the first scenes in the complicated newsroom to the later swirling scenes in the press room at the criminal building. Watch. And listen. If you can keep up.It probably helped just a little that the bugs were worked out of the screenplay here by the fact this began as a 1928 Ben Hecht stage play called The Front Page (in fact, one of the turning points has to do with soapbox politics that sound a decade out of date by 1939). This is also already a remake of the same play, under the original title (and this 1931 screwball prototype is quite amazing, too, though second fiddle to the Hawks version). Hawks and his screenwriter Charles Lederer updated the writing in other ways, though, mentioning the war in Europe, Hitler, and, for a big laugh, Grant's dimple. But if Cary Grant is already appreciated, Rosalind Russell needs to be remembered better. She had a number of terrific films, and she plays the smart strong woman perfectly. It's almost as though that kind of character became unpopular after the War, strong women taking the form of the mature Bette Davis or Joan Crawford instead, or any number of femme fatales (who are, you have to admit, strong). But Russell (see her Sister Kenny for starters) is fast, physically adroit, coy, and willing to take a joke.You'll probably want to see this movie twice, either twice in a row and again very soon. And you'll be amazed what you missed the first time, the kicks under the table (several), or the innuendoes (straight and gay both), and the straight up funny comebacks. Hold on to your hats!</fullReview>

I remember watching this about 35 years ago and it still stands up - from start to finish.You feel like a fly on the wall watching some inner secret organization called "The News." It is so good that although there are many talented supporting actors, Rosalind Russell is the pivotal character. With her all things stand. Cary Grant is brilliant as always but Ms. Russell is so good and so dominant (without being overbearing) that the movie is like a 1 woman show.The unfortunate thing is that it has nothing to do with today's so-called "media." I was a freelance photojournalist for a few years in NYC and I can tell you that things are very different from this movie. Don't idolize news reporters b/c this species has hit the latte' cafe' and they ain't turnin' back.Regardless, see it and you will know what real total unmitigated non-agenda plain old fashioned ENTERTAINMENT is all about. 10+/10.-Zafoid</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The classic 30s comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the finest examples of 1930s comedy, and an excellent adaptation of a story that has been told many times, *His Girl Friday* is Hollywood at its best. Perfectly pairing Grant and Russell with an excellent script by Charles Lederer, based on Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's 1931 play, *The Front Page*, it is the kind of studio magic that could occur when the powers-that-be assigned the best work to the best candidates. Grant, whom I found arrogant and repellant later in his career ? not to mention redundant ? is at his suave-and-smooth best here as Walter Burns, newspaper editor,, with the perfect foil in Rosiland Russell. As Hildy Johnson, Burns' ex-wife, Russell plays was in the process of cutting her teeth developing characters like this. Hildy is the archetype that gave Russell her reputation as a fast-talking dame, with machine gun delivery, and a smart-mouthed answer for everything. Hildy is off to marry Bruce, played by Bellamy, but her ex, Walter, still needs her to be his star reporter and cover the execution of a convicted killer. Every early journalistic stereotype is in full force ? from reporters who would stop at nothing to get their story, to the city editor with a visor and sleeve-garters. Gene Lockhart, Ernest Truex and Clarence Kolb are all in fine form, but even the finest supporting performances pale against Grant and Russell. They are both delightful in this stylish slapstick farce that had previously been filmed as *The Front Page* (and later, again as *The Front Page* in 1974, and as *Switching Channels*). It also spawned a slew of imitators, not the least of which was TV's *Moonlighting*. Screenwriter Lederer's scripts have a freshness even today ? 1995 saw a remake of his script *Kiss Of Death* and 2001 brings us *Ocean's Eleven*, which Lederer wrote the script for in 1960.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Howard Hawks was completely on top of his game when he shot this film. It is an enduring, eternal film classic.He took an already popular story, "The Front Page", and fixed it by creating the female Hildy. This came about during a party, at which Hawks, holding forth, was going to have the party goers read "The Front Page" for a lark. So he hands around the scripts, and discovers there aren't enough men. A woman gets the Hildy part.And the rest, movie-lovers, is Cinema History. What a master stroke!Great casting! Great acting! Great direction, and photography! Great screenplay that nicely serves up Big City Corruption and dances around the unscrupulous abuse of 1st Amendment freedoms by the Press.All with taste, artistic and noble.

		<fullReview>Grant and Russell are comedy gold in this picture. They have an excellent comedic chemistry. Russell deliver's Hildy's lines so naturally it was as though MacArthur and Hecht wrote that dialog for her, specifically. and still maintained the grit of the original.I've never been a big fan of Ralph Bellamy but he plays the bright-eyed innocent with zest. And Grant is deliciously reprehensible as Walter Burns. I have trouble seeing what Hildy saw in him during their first marriage and that's as it should be.My only quibble is the inevitable 'woman gives up her own life for a man' scenario that is so much a part of 30's, 40's and 50's cinema post-code. Hildy is most alive when she's chasing the story and Russell looks a touch uncomfortable playing the 'little woman' moments. Less believable.All in all the best of the film versions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are two of my favourite screen personalities, but this movie's being 100% about the dialogue annoyed me, and the speed of the dialogue just made me anxious!If you don't like words and dialogue - don't see this. It is 100% dialogue. The words are all it is. The leads are just mouthpieces, the stagings very stagey and studio-based - what it has in abundance is words words words, a hundred miles and hour till they grate on your skull, itch at your skin and come out your mouth as you tell it "enough, stop!" This is what Stroheim feared movies would become - all talk, no cinema.Interestingly, the reason the talk grated on me was half how rushed and urgent it was, half the fact that i could only half hear it because it was a cheapie DVD with bad sound. The insight it afforded me was to point out to you all that the words are the artifice that this film consists of. There are many movies in this world that you could turn the sound off and not only still understand it, but have a ball of a time watching them: Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Touch of Evil (1958), The Searchers (1955) and 2001 (1968) spring to mind - but there are heaps of them. The best movies combine dialogue with pictures for a terrific experience (Citizen Kane, 1941 is one of the best).Everything cinematic was forgotten in this film, though, and Stroheim's worst fears for the end of silence and the coming of sound were proved true.If I can stand properly hearing the dialogue, i'll probably watch this again some time - but i did not enjoy it at all.2/5.</fullReview>

It creates this dynamic relationship that is realistic to real life?talking loud, talking over each other, and all. I also liked the whole energetic world of journalism and how it seemed to parallel the fast-paced dialog. "His Girl Friday" depicts an entertaining battle of the sexes that is very enjoyable for the viewer.I didn't think the movie's attempt at drama was a good decision. It's a comedy so don't include suicide attempts, gallows, and killers unless they are comedic. This whole part fell flat for me. The movie was also fairly predictable, but the back and forth between the main characters kept it interesting and enjoyable.All and all, the acting was excellent and the chemistry between the characters was spot on. The writing, in regards to the fast-paced dialog, was also a strong suit. Watch this and then go watch "Gilmore Girls" if you like the machine-gun style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"His Girl Friday is a fast past hilarious screw ball comedy. If you enjoy face paced movies, then this is a perfect fit for you. I don't believe that there is one slow scene in the whole movie with plenty of twist and turns.The main characters Walter Burns and Hildy Johnson, played by Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell absolute steal the show. If the entire movie only involved those too characters I probably would have enjoy. If you blink or sneeze during this film you'll probably miss one of Walter or Hildy brilliant lines. The few things I didn't enjoy in this movie were, I felt that the crazed man Earl Williams who was accused of killing a cop, just wasn't crazy enough for me. I wanted to see a real lunatic but he just seemed like a normal guy. I also felt that his "girl friend" Mollie Malloy jump out the window was too extreme of a scene for this comedy. It kinda took a dark theme for a moment even though she didn't die.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>screwball funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me the movie was a little ordinary . The dialogue seemed more jokes then ever. Kind of corny to me, it made it a little to simple. The couple was very energetic, I did like the actors that played the main parts in this film. The did talk a little to fast for my likening. But still performed their best. I liked that the movie was a screwball comedy but I didn't like how the ending was. It was like you knew what was already going to happen. The sound was great. The busy office, the sounds of the city lifestyles. I didn't think it was really realistic, not a lot of people get divorce and back together. That hardly happens now, let alone in 1940s. That wasn't really allowed then. I thought the black and white really made things pop out. If it was in color, really don't think i would enjoy it as much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>His Girl Friday</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Howard Hawks (Bringing Up Baby, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes), I knew this film's leading actor and that it featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I just watched it. Basically Hildegaard 'Hildy' Johnson (Rosalind Russell) divorced her husband, and the editor of the newspaper she works for, Walter Burns (Cary Grant), and being engaged to a new man, insurance salesman Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy). But Walter finds a way to make her stay to write one last big story, about murderer Earl Williams (John Qualen) and useless Sheriff Peter B.'Pinky' Hartwell (Gene Lockhart). Also getting caught in the web of Walter's craftiness and Hildy forced to get all the facts are the crooked Mayor (Clarence Kolb) and Bruce's Mother (Alma Kruger), all eventually brought together for the conclusion. Grant is charismatic and charming, Russell is likable as his former spouse, the scenes of them together create sparks too, and the film is filled with witty dialogue, a pretty funny "screwball" comedy classic. Cary Grant number 10 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 19 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 4 on Britain's Finest Actors, he was number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 23 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 19 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as it gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"His Girl Friday" is essential viewing, perhaps the best of the screwball comedies, or at least one of the ones modern audiences will find the most reliably funny. The comedy comes from the famous fast-talking reporters trampling over some some truly hilarious dimwit characters, but also from the visual gags, the hilarious dialogue, and the ever-increasing absurdity of the situation the characters find themselves in.As brilliant as the script is, this would have been a bomb without the perfect casting and career performances by Grant and Russell, as well as the stellar character actors who provide truly perfect foils for them at every stage of the film.Unfortunately, comedies that rely on gross-outs and awkwardness have basically forced movies like this into the cinematic history books. Thank goodness for DVD!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an incredibly fast-paced comedy, which in the typical screwball mode, pits newspaper editor Cary Grant against his star reporter, ex-wife Rosalind Russell, whom he wants to cover the execution of an anarchist before she goes off to marry Ralph Bellamy. Cary Grant--Rosalind Russell--Ralph Bellamy. I really don't need to say more. If you like this, check out "His Favorite Wife" and "The Awful Truth".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>His Girl Friday is a classic comedy directed by Howard Hawks and starring Cary Grant. This team is responsible for Bringing Up Baby &amp; I Was A Male War Bride. All of these movies rank among the funniest ever made.Grant runs a newspaper and Rosalind Russell is his ex-wife and a top reporter. She is remarrying and Grant is determined to stop it from happening. As you'd expect from a Hawks comedy, alot of wild things start happening. This is a hilarious movie with great performances by Grant and Russell. There is a great line, ad-libbed by Grant when his secretary asks him how she'll identify the character played by Ralph Bellamy.His Girl Friday is quite entertaining, one of the best comedies Holllywood has ever produced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>about as perfect a film as you can find</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This and ARSENIC AND OLD LACE are my two favorite Cary Grant movies. Both are nearly perfect and, for once, I have NO CRITICISMS WHATSOEVER about either film.Well, HIS GIRL Friday is a remake of the fine film THE FRONT PAGE. However, bucking a general trend, this film is definitely better than the original, as it is jam packed full of energy and snappy dialog. Just listening to the dialog between Grant and Russell is something to behold! I really think if they slowed down the film to normal speed, it would last about 30 minutes longer! But, despite its blistering speed, it works great. Watch and laugh--it just doesn't get much better than this.By the way, there are several wonderful inside jokes in the film. The first, and the funniest, is when Cary is describing his ex-wife's boyfriend to someone. He's at a loss for how to describe him and finally says that the guy "looks like that actor,...Ralph Bellamy"--and the guy playing the boyfriend IS Bellamy!! Then later, Cary is talking about a guy he knew named "Arichie Leach". Archie Leech is Cary Grant's REAL name! Cute touches like this, combined with the lightning-fast pacing, wonderfully overlapping dialog and general kookiness make this a MUST-SEE. Amazingly enough, Grant's comedies BRINGING UP BABY and ARSENIC AND OLD LACE are even better--if it's possible!!! See them all--you deserve it!!By the way, IF you can find a decent copy of THE FRONT PAGE (1931), it is well worth seeing and almost as good as HIS GIRL Friday. However, be forewarned that many DVD and videotapes are public domain copies that are unwatchable due to serious volume and print problems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hilarious Motion Pictures Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>His Girl Friday*Spoilers*I was required to watch this film for my senior film class and I barely shown any interests in it. It wasn't until 2 years later when many people debate His Girl Friday is very fast paced and funniest film they ever had seen. That make me wonder a lot so I just order the DVD off internet and I got pretty good copy. To my surprise, it is very great entertainment and just hilarious film.Cary Grant is at his best when he play Walter Burns when he tried to lured his ex-wife Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) back to work at newspaper office for big story about convicted murderer. It's just amazing how they talk very rapidly and I just had to laughing throughout the film constantly, which is very rare treat for me since modern comedies are kinda iffy.Ralph Bellamy is just amazing as Russell's finace Bruce, who kept get in trouble with law and send to jail numerous of times. That's very hilarious part since Louie, Grant's errand boy, kept get Bellamy in trouble with law. It is amazing to me that Howard Hawks, the director of His Girl Friday, would allowed someone to use their real name to identify one of the actor in film, which is case with Ralph Bellamy when prostitute ask Grant what does Russell's fiancee look like. It's so fast paced that you just had to watch it over and over to understand specific things like how did newspapermen flipped out in newsroom? It averaged about 220-240 words per minute compared to modern film averaged about 100 words per minute, which is amazing feat. I strongly recommend it you to watch this film because it's sheer amazing!****/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FAST, SNAPPY Dialog. Well written, Well acted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most entertaining; The way Cary's character connives to trick Friday to stay on the story is navitete. Roz is hooked, but refuses to see the trap. By being drawn into the escape and subsequent hiding of the prisoner,she has unknowingly sent herself back into the arms of the man who refused to pop the question. Excellent acting accomplished by the prisoner (hiding in the roll top desk) and his girlfriend throwing herself out the window to distract the press pool located in the very same second story room. Reminds me of " Bringing up Baby " with a role reversal for Cary Grant. Whereas Kathryn Hepburn plays the trickster. For pure Fun, they're both must see films while humped up in the house with your wife/husband cold beer and popcorn.` Turn down the lights and ENJOY Hollywood at its best!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's difficult to dislike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When people tell me that classical Hollywood films do not appeal to them, I understand it. Except for Citizen Kane, that is. It's hard to argue in any case with that film. But if someone says "I don't like Casablanca," I can understand that. Not that I don't like Casablanca. I like it quite a lot. It's just that, well, as much as I like Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart, I just don't think that their skills as actors are very high (well, Bergman's good, while I would pick any number of actresses from foreign films or silent films or more modern films). This is because I do not think true acting, at least for the American talkies, came about until the likes of James Dean and Marlon Brando. Acting before seems only to have been born from the style of acting you see in the theater. I have never been a huge fan of the theater because of this same reason. Actors act only with their voices. They have to get what they are saying heard, so nothing ever sounds sincere. There are so few silent moments.His Girl Friday is a great example of this. There is not a second where people aren't talking a mile a minute. Even when the dialogue is great, it starts to grate on your patience. But this is just a small criticism of mine. Although I would completely sympathize with someone disliking this film, I liked it a lot. Even if the dialogue does grate, it is still great. And the actors, even if they do act as if they're on a stage and not as if they were human beings, are very good. Cary Grant is always great to watch. His abilities are effortless. I could never imagine him in a serious role (I'm sure he had to have had a few; my only other Cary Grant experiences are two of his Hitchcock films: To Catch a Thief and North By Northwest). He's a lot like Bogart, and any number of other stars (as opposed to actors), whose persona is so fun that we go along with him wherever he goes. Rosalind Russel is an actress I've never seen before. If I ever do, I won't be able to see much beyond the persona she establishes as Hildy Johnson. She may have been a very popular actress, for all I know, but even if this were her first film, she holds her own with Grant. The supporting character actors, especially the other newsmen, the gangster, the sheriff, the mayor, etc, are all very good. My only other complaint is that the few dramatic moments in the film tend to work against the overall comedic mood of the picture. The entire execution part of the plot seems almost as if it is from another movie. And especially the suicide attempt of Molly Malloy (what a terrible name, by the way) hurts the film. In fact, the rest of the movie is so good, that it almost cancels out these creaks. Almost. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I &#x2665; Cary Grant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since I saw Cary Grant in one of his later films Charade with Audrey Hepburn, I have just loved him in every other role I have seen him in and His Girl Friday was no exception. This was a highly entertaining screwball comedy starred Cary Grant as the Morning Post Editor, Walter Burns and his ex-wife Hildy Johnson who was played by the lovely Rosalind Russell. Their bickering as ex-husband and wife was funny to watch and they had good chemistry. Only a former husband who still cared for his ex that much would go as far as burns did constantly throughout the movie getting Hildy's new husband to be thrown in jail and getting her to cover one last news story before she leaves the newspaper behind to become a housewife.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most annoying movies I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that people who loved good cinema would all have similar tastes, boy was I wrong. I had to sit through this P.O.S. in my film class. If I hadn't been in class I would have turned it off after the first 20 minutes (and a movie has to be REALLY bad to make me do that). I kept waiting for the characters to go somewhere or do something. I can watch David Lynch movies about nothing and enjoy them, but this was just aweful. After about an hour I realized that the whole movie was going to be the same. After the movie was over I realized that I had lost 2 hours of my life that I can never get back. As far as comedies go I put it right up there with Caddyshack 2... aweful. No good music, no good cinematography, no characters that I like or care about(mean characters that put an innocent man in jail), and not a single funny moment.To each their own!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not only a horrible comedy - but an anti-death-penalty propaganda film, as well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As mind-numbingly bad as "Front Page". One of the worst movies ever made. This annoying, unfunny left-wing trash has absolutely nothing going for it.It isn't a comedy with an anti-capital punishment sub-plot. It is an anti-capital punishment movie which pretends to be a comedy. It's merely leftist Hollywood propaganda with a moronic plot, unlikable characters (except Bellamy's), and unfunny machine-gun-style line delivery; it would appear that the cast competed not in who would be funnier but who would say their lines fastest, resulting in a series of tediously fast "blab-blab-blab" verbal exchanges that are pathetically short on laughs.Then there are the numerous idiotic plot-devices, and various one-sided attempts to hammer in the point about the injustice of capital punishment. Bellamy getting repeatedly framed isn't funny: it's dull and stupid. The killer's girlfriend jumping out of the window is a mind-bogglingly dumb event, and only further proves that this is a political propaganda movie, first and foremost. And what's with the journalists all being middle-aged, bald, card-playing little weasels, with Russell sticking out ridiculously? Dumb, dumb, dumb. Typical old-movie nonsense.The writer's disdain for capitalism and authority is so strong that he didn't even give the killer a single line in which he expresses sorrow over having taken the life of another man; but because the victim is a cop we are supposed to not care about the "accidental" killing! Cary Grant has never been so unsympathetic as a character who was meant to be likable! The second half, in particular, is literally unwatchable.The film was made in the 40s, before McCarthy joined the celluloid fun and cleaned the house a bit. (And no, it wasn't a "witch-hunt" because witches do not exist, and Communists do; this dumb leftist analogy will never cease to amaze me.) The fact that every movie catalogs gives this crap-o-rama full marks more than ANYTHING ELSE proves what politically biased left-wing malarkey this is. Just how bad does a left-wing movie have to get before leftist critics start rating it objectively? I guess that even Ed Wood would have been praised - ultra-excessively - had he made left-wing movies.Leonard Maltin placed this piece of garbage in his all-time 10 best list. Just like a bird-brained nerd to laugh at this sort of "humour".Please punish me hard, VERY HARD, by clicking "no" below. That'll teach me...</fullReview>
