		<shortDescription>The True Nature of Sacrifice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prior to this release, Neil LaBute had this to say about the 1973 original: "It's surprising how many people say it's their favorite soundtrack. I'm like, come on! You may not like the new one, but if that's your favorite soundtrack, I don't know if I *want* you to like my film." Neil, a word. You might want to sit down for this too; as Lord Summerisle says, shocks are so much better absorbed with the knees bent. See, Neil, the thing about the original, is that Paul Giovanni's soundtrack is one of the most celebrated things about it. The filmmakers themselves consider it a virtual musical. Along with Richard and Danny Thompson, and Bert Jansch, it practically kick-started the 1970s Folk New Wave. To undermine it is akin to imagining Jaws without John Williams. Or The Buddy Holly Story without Buddy Holly. The result's one of the most breathtakingly arrogant, pointless remake of a British cult classic since Sly Stallone's Get Carter.The original had apparently left Nicolas Cage "disturbed for about two weeks." So disturbed, during that fortnight's window, that he pitched the idea of re-imagining one of the most nuanced films about inter-faith struggle ever devised to a writer-director previously known for his wholly unsubtle depictions of male chauvinism. It's like some parlor game: what would you get if Sam Peckinpah took on Bambi? Or Gaspar "Irreversible" Noe remade Love, Actually?(Actually, I'd quite like to see that). Unfortunately, someone took this parlor game seriously: All LaBute's succeeded in doing is ripping out the original's guts while saddling it with his own gormless Sex War preoccupations.After failing to rescue a little girl and her mum from a fatal car crash, Cage's highway patrolman spirals into a medicated torpor. Then he receives a letter from ex-fiancée Willow Woodward (this one trades on name-homages for kudos), now living on the private island community of Summersisle ? that extra 's' stands for 'superfluous' ? and wants Edward to help locate missing daughter Rowan.Summersisle, it transpires, is a female-dominated joint, conceived as a haven for oppressed womenfolk and refugees from the Salem witch trials. Here, the matriarchs observe the Olde ways, and the few males are near-mute breed-mules. It's like Lilith Fair on a grand scale. Summersisle's main export is honey ? a symbolic and literal headache for Edward, as he's allergic to bees. "Beekeepers!" cries Edward. "They seem to be everywhere on this island!" Well, that's probably because Summersisle's main export is honey.While making his investigations, Edward overhears of an oncoming Mayday ritual called "the time of death and rebirth". He discovers the previous year's crop failed; nearly dies from bee stings; and eventually comes to the conclusion (a conclusion which admittedly couldn't be more obvious if the locals had tattooed a timetable of events on the back of his hands) that Rowan will be burnt alive in a pagan rite to ensure a bountiful harvest. He also meets the Queen Bee of the hive, Sister Summersisle (Burstyn), who has her own plans for him involving the eponymous Wicker Man: "The drone must die." First, the good news: any concerns Cage would be airlifted from the Wicker Man's flaming jaws at the last minute by a fleet of black CIA helicopters can be laid to rest: he toast. That's about it for the good news. "This is a story whose chapters were carefully written" intones Burstyn with sublime irony. Though retaining the basic cat-and-mouse premise (and credits typography), what's left subjects the original to a scorched-earth policy.Crucial to Shaffer's original screenplay was that his Christian copper, in accordance with ritual, came to the island of his own free will ? and most importantly, was a virgin; the perfect sacrifice. In reducing matters to a sexual, as opposed to a religious power-struggle, LaBute presents the flimsiest of qualifiers for a harvest sacrifice. By the time Cage has worked out he was the bait, you honestly couldn't care less.And Cage is one of the very worst things in this; a lumbering, drawling donkey ? an arsewit whose tongue seems just slightly too big for his mouth. "Goddamit" he moans after he hallucinates a drowned Rowan, with all the mental torment of a man who's set his morning alarm clock half-an-hour too early. One hopes it's his character's frequent reliance on pills that has reduced him to this state ? alternately fatigued, then full of preppy, overbearing vim. If so, it's a fine portrayal of an undistinguished IQ addled with anti-depressants. If not?it doesn't bear thinking about. As Willow, the saucer-eyed Beahan is similarly dreadful, presenting her lines as if in competition with Cage for the?most?half-hearted?delivery. While Burstyn entirely lacks the mercurial menace to convince. Who's afraid of Naomi Wolf? Every element that made the original great ? the lovingly detailed depictions of folk customs, the ingenious score, the dialogue (Lord Summerisle's majestic "You did it beautifully!" has been replaced with the rather less attractive "You did it excellently!" Whoah, dude!) ? have been substituted for a meandering battle-of-the-sexes thriller with occasional crash-bang wallop. Namely, walloping women; this is a LaBute flick, after all. Cage's Sister Beech bashing is just one of the more embarrassing episodes; impotent little men will be hooting with glee at how them uppity hippie chicks finally got what was comin' to 'em, hyuk hyuk.The closing coda sees the whole rotten mess collapsing under the weight of genre cliché: in a bar, two guys run into a couple of Summersisle maidens on shore leave, flirty-fishing for fresh martyrs. At the moment of their successful pick-up, you half expect the women to turn round and give an exaggerated wink and a thumbs up to the camera.One more thing: keen credit watchers may have noticed that films sporting an unusually high producer count (anything up to 10) tend to be Not Much Cop. The Wicker Man has 18 producers in total.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Movie I've EVER Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars that I've spent in a very, very long time. If you knew how often I went to the movies you'd probably say, that's hard to imagine, but never-the-less, it's true! After seeing the trailer for this movie, I knew that I had to see it! If you're a fan of horror, mystery, and suspense, why wouldn't you? The trailer is nothing less than intriguing and exciting; unfortunately, the movie is none of these.From the cinematography, to the script, to the acting, this movie is a complete flop. If you're reading this, planning to go to the movie expecting some thrills, mystery, action, horror, or anything other than a waste of an hour and forty-five minutes I'm afraid you are in for disappointment."Why is it so bad," you might be asking yourself. Let me tell you. The movie was neither mysterious nor suspenseful. Nothing about the movie made me the least bit "on edge," frightened, or curious. The script was at best laughable. There were numerous times throughout the film where the dialogue was just so ridiculous I began to write it off as comic relief only to find out a few seconds later that it wasn't. The acting was absolutely dreadful. I like Nicholas Cage but this was a miss. Without exception, every performance in this movie was incredibly below average. The cinematography was awful with not one moment of suspense or mystique. Finally, the story is completely transparent. You can see the end of this movie coming a mile away.I am not usually a very harsh critic. Frankly, when I go to see a comedy I want to laugh and when I go to see a mystery/suspense/horror, I just want to be surprised. This movie was boring, poorly acted, poorly written, and an overwhelming disappointment. Do yourself a favor and go see something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wicker Man. I am so angry that I cannot write a proper comment about this movie.The plot was ridiculous, thinly tied together, and altogether-just lame. Nicolas Cage...shame on you! I assumed that since you were in it, that it would be at least decent. It was not.I felt like huge parts of the movie had been left on the cutting room floor, and even if it's complete-the movie was just outlandish and silly.At the end you're left mouth agape, mind befuddled and good taste offended. I have never heard so many people leave a theater on opening day with so much hatred. People were complaining about it in small groups in the mall, four floors down from the theater near the entrance. It's that bad.I heard it compared to : Glitter, American Werewolf in Paris and Gigli. My boyfriend was so mad he wouldn't even talk about it.Grrrr!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, this movie does no credit whatsoever to the original. Nicholas Cage, fairly wooden as far as actors go, imbues the screen with a range of skill from, non-plussed to over the top. The supporting cast is no better.The plot stays much the same as the original in terms of scene progression but is far worse. Not enough detail is given to allow the audience to by into what is being sold. It turns out it's just a bill of poor goods. Disbelief cannot be suspended, nor can a befit of a doubt be given. The only saving aspect of this film is that it is highly visual, as the medium requires, and whomever scouted the location should be commended.There was much laughter in the audience and multiple boos, literally, at the end.Disappointed! Wait for the original to come on television, pour a whiskey and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original, but just wanted to drop a quick note to anyone who happens to scroll down this far: Wicker Man is the worst movie I've seen this year. Maybe even in two years. I wish I could ask the theater for my money back or turn back time to warn myself not to see it.I'll give it two positive nods: The sarcasm of Cage's character at least got some laughs from me and the scenery of the island was beautiful. Sorry, that's it. Here come the jeers. The movie's plot is only propelled forward because other characters won't give Cage any straight answers--and he puts up with this!!! How this could go on for over an hour of my time(much less days in the movie) is beyond me. Not to mention that the plot is full of holes. You leave the theater with enough unanswered questions to fill a library. How anyone could read this script and think, "Yes, people should pay $11 to see this shady outline of what a film should look like" is beyond me.Do not go see this flick. Or even rent it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone not aware of the 1973 original British Lion movie ' The Wicker Man' would,no doubt, have left the cinema with the impression 'Poor' and 'Peurile'.As a devotee of the original I left with the impression Purely Poor.From the grim reality of haggle toothed inbreds drawing the force of law and order into a web of paganistic barbaric ritual on a remote Scottish island, named Summerisle(the original) to a near Amazon-ic colony off the Maine coast of the US, named Summersisle, the remake hardly hits the spot.This is, quite sadly, a case of what 'could' have been a classic remake of a classic being tampered with to cater for a simple minded public. NOTHING MORE AND NOTHING LESS. Gentlemen (or given the reworked context of the film) Ladies involved ... hang your heads in shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How this film could miss so many of the fascinating, complex and mysterious aspects of the original story or the original movie is truly remarkable. An unbelievably thin and unengaging plot, ankle-deep characterisation/motivation and a really awful soundtrack (replacing tension with vast swathes of noise, replacing the arcane musical references of the original for digitised crashes and roars. Then there are the specific references to the original which are merely "plastered on" over the cracks... Dreadful. In a world where gormless, brain-dead Amerikan remakes of The Italian Job (a tear appears), Get Carter (sobs uncontrollably) and Alfie have desecrated our screens recently, this one takes the proverbial biscuit. Execrable nonsense. How Ellen Burstyn ever got involved is a wonder... Rubbish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst films I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the worst fillums I've ever seen and I've seen a few. It is slow, boring, amateurish - not even consistent within its own simplistic reading of the plot. The actors do not act. I can't blame them - they have been given a script of such utter banality all they can do is trudge through it with a pain behind their eyes which has nothing to do with the evil goings on in SummersIsle.There is not one moment in this film that rings true - not an honest line nor a single instant where one is moved. The Nicholas Cage character is so badly drawn that one feels not a smidgeon of compassion for him through all his tribulations. I have no doubt that I was seeing a suffering man up there but it was Nicholas Cage fully aware of the fact that he was in the worst movie of his entire career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>what ever you do do not waste your time on this pointless. movie. A remake that did not need to be retold. Everyone coming out of the theater had the same comments. Worst movie I ever saw. Save your time and money!!!Nicgolas Cage was biking down hills, swimming in murky water and rolling down hills while being attacked by bees but yet his suit was still perfectly pressed and shirt crisp white until the very last scene.Although a good cast with Ellen Bernstein and Cage the acting was just as unbelievable as the movie itself. It is amazing how good actors can do such bad movies. Don't they get a copy of the script first. If you still have any interest at all in seeing the movie at the very least wait for it to come out on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful, barely coherent, vague rehash of an all-time classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was terrible. OK, my favourite film is 'The Wicker Man' (1973), so I was always bound to be a little biased. The plot rambles along, throwing out enough of the key elements of the original to make the term 'remake' highly dubious. (He's not a virgin, but IS allergic to bees. WOW!) So many things happen that make no sense and are unexplained, which I'm afraid Mr LaBute does not a horror movie make. (How are two people we clearly saw blown up in a car at the start alive and well at the end of the film?) Cage looks haggard and bewildered throughout, and his character is prone to calling out "Rowan!?" at the slightest noise. The 'nods' to the original are irritating as they come off as tacky rather than as intelligent homage. For example, certain incidents mirror the original (The girl falling out of a cupboard pretending to be dead when Woodward/Cage is searching the island) and several lines of dialogue are plucked straight from Anthony Schaffers original screenplay and shoehorned in.I'm sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis than this, I really can't be bothered to write any more about this film. It lacks any kind of substance. Throw it on the scrap heap with all the other remakes that have sullied the good names of the films they were 'based' on (in this case very loosely).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't let the premise fool you--this was one funny movie. The problem--it wasn't supposed to be a comedy. The story sets you up nicely for an ending that never comes. Even worse, the set-up is NEVER explained. You will leave the theater asking "Is that it?" I rate it a 2 simply because there were a few brief moments of promise, but the finish leaves you completely flat. Nicholas Cage did as good a job as can be expected in the role, but he had very little to work with. There are odd quirks, and interesting turns everywhere, which had absolutely nothing to do with the movie. Let this one come out on video before wasting your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neil Labute should have his member slathered in honey and laced with bees (Spolier Alert)....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone else who has commented negatively about this film have done excellent analysis as to why this film is so bloody awful. I wasn't going to comment, but the film just bugs me so much, and the writer/director in particular. So I must toss in my hat to join the naysayers.I saw the original "Wicker Man" and really loved the cornucopia of music, sensuality, paganism in a modern world, and the clash of theological beliefs. This said, I am not part of the crowd that thinks remakes of great movies shouldn't be done. For example, I liked the original 1950's "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", but equally enjoyed the 1978 remake. Both films can stand on their own. Another example is "The Thing". The original, as campy as it looks compared to today's standards, has a lot to be proud of in the 1982 remake with Kurt Russell (my all time favorite horror movie). So that small minority of people who like "The Wicker Man" re-make can not accuse me of dissing this piece of crap just because it's a re-make.This film solidified for me Neil LaBute's sexism and misogynistic tendencies. It also made me wonder how executives, wanting to make a serious thriller, would green light a product that is so anti-female. There are too many scenes of Cage hitting women just because he's frustrated with them thwarting his investigation of a missing girl. would he react like this off the island in other cases where suspects aren't forthcoming? The original created a society in which men and women are equal participants in a Goddess based religion. The threat to the main character came from everyone, male and female. There was no sexual hierarchy.The metaphor of bees, drones etc was a bit heavy handed and convenient ("The drone must die!"), especially when Cage's character has bee allergies. I kept wondering why the men on the island didn't fight back and use mere physicality to stop these women from treating them like grunts. These were not women with special supernatural powers, and half of them seemed to be pregnant, the other half old and fat, and the rest girls and thin blonde waifs, so if the men really wanted to escape they could do what most men do when they hate women. Physically dominate them. There didn't seem to be any guns or weapons beyond cutting tools to hold them if they were unhappy. But if they were content being drones, why make them unable to speak? They could be used as a threat to Cage because they will defend the community. They are drones because Neil LaBute seems to believe that a society ran by women would leave men castrated. (That movie was made already. "The Stepford Wives" anyone?) Classic symptoms from men who are afraid of what may happen if women got their sh*t together and were truly equal citizens.The problem with the man-hating female society is that it makes uninteresting movie viewing and creates unintentional humor when Cage starts knocking women out. I belief LaBute should've left the society an egalitarian one, kept the sexuality and uninhibited lasciviousness, and pushed buttons of discomfort in regards to the children on that island. No one likes pedophiles or children to be sexually exploited. So how would a cop react if he saw lewd acts performed by adults with children around? There would be a logical mental leap that these children are abused, thus, an urgency created to save the missing child and get help for all the children. LaBute has said he created the fiancé and daughter story thread to give Cage's character an incentive to search. I don't think you need that. Any child abused will make an adult react to save them. The irony of course would be that the child Cage "saves" ultimately brings him death.The dialogue was contrived and campy. The whole third act was hilarious. The audience I saw it with guffawed (and later booed at the end). I just thought the movie started off wrong when the letter arrived written in the fancy handwriting and all the flashbacks cutting into to show how wounded Cage is. We don't need that. Just show him arriving on the island for an investigation of a missing child. Most of us in America have seen "Law &amp; Order" and other cop procedurals. We come into the movie as if we are Cage's partner solving a mystery.So much potential...wasted. Neil LaBute, stick to talking head pictures for people who enjoy your male angst-ridden plays and flicks of that sort. Stay with your own company of men. Leave the thrillers for people who understand thrillers. Here is your jar of honey. I'll watch that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilariously Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A phenomenal achievement in awfulness. It's actually hilariously awful.First off...Nicholas Cage must now have made it to the finals in the Over-Emoting Category in his acting class. Wearing new hair plugs and with a face that has been lifted so many times his pinned back ears seem to be straining to touch in the back he oozes not only a sick smarmiess but creates a "hero" character that you have no vested interest in.I don't know what it is with Neil Labute and female characters. He makes females out to be totally deviant and evil...and pays them back by having Cage punch several of them directly in the face and call them all "b****es" a few times too. I've enjoyed LaBute's early films and a few of his plays...but it's a strange fascination he has.I'd give this film a 2 out of 10 solely based on Ellen Burstyn's performance. By the time she finally makes her appearance (bravely soldiering through her scenes with her wig line clearly visible on her forehead) it seems like all hope may be lost. She deserves an Oscar right here and now for saying her lines with a straight face and when she appears wearing a white mumu and blue, white, and gold face paint booming about The Wicker Man you know that working with Scorcese and Friedkin really prepped her for this role dang well.This movie is so wrong-headed and cuckoo that is has to be seen to be believed.Highlights include: Nicholas Cage running away from a swarm of bees and then falling down a hill.Nicholas Cage stealing a bicycle and looking like Ms. Gulch from The Wizard of Oz riding around on it.Nicholas Cage running around the island kicking down doors looking for the missing girl.Leelee Sobieski PLUMMETING from a once-promising acting career in a "brawl" with Cage.Ellen Burstyn dancing around in a said while mumu.Nicholas Cage screaming "Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it?Who burned it?Who burned it?Who burned it?" for no reason.Nicholas Cage in a bear costume (I'm not kidding) running through the woods, taking off the costume (but leaving the bear feet on) and then doing some karate moves to some villains.And you haven't lived until you have seen the final 15 minutes of the movie and its dreadful epilogue that looked like it was shot yesterday in your cousin's basement.Needless to say, if you can make it through this film without laughing out loud then you deserve a medal. There was actually a point in the movie where I stopped snickering to wonder if maybe this wasn't an elaborate send-up of "hysteria" films...only to be reminded when Cage would scream/shout/whisper his dialogue that he really was taking himself quite seriously.I think this one is destined to be a cult film all over again...just because it's so dreadful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most painful cinema experiences.. ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so I am an original Wicker Man fan and I usually don't like British films remade by Americans, so why oh why did I put myself through the most painful cinema experiences ever? I am not a Nicolas Cage fan and I had some kind of moment of madness perhaps? The film was appalling! The bit at the beginning with the crash/fire had no relevance to the film at all and the female cop knew where Edward was going, so the bit at the end with the two girls visiting the mainland, well it wouldn't have happened as the whole thing would have been investigated. The history behind the wicker man wasn't really explored - and I guess being set in America didn't really help the whole pagan theme. This film was slow and contained no atmosphere or suspense. I must say that the best bit was right at the end, when Nicolas Cage goes up in flames! I am in such desperate need to see the original again now, in order to cleanse my disappointed soul. I really can't stress how disappointing this film is, please don't see it if you:A) Don't like American re-makes of British Films B) Are a fan of the original C) Hate Nicolas Cage</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wicker Man vs The Lilith Fair Rejects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wicker Man Has Done The Impossible! It replaced Cat Woman as the worst recent movie in my steel trap cinema mind. YES it's really that bad. So bad that when sitting down to write this review I thought to myself "If I had a choice to either see this movie again or to have red hot needles shoved in my eyes" I might actually go for the red hot needles.Neil LaBute created a rare movie where Joel Schumacher could sit back and say with comfort and a guilt free mind "Yeah that's some bad direction right there".I think the first clue for myself should have been the tag line: "Some Sacrifices Must Be Made". Sure it might sound sort of cheeky ominous line to intrigue you but the sacrifice will be all on the audience side of the screen. Trust me on this the people responsible for this movie should be charged with a hate crime..or at least fraud for trying to pass this off as anything resembling entertainment. Seriously! The movie is about an island where men are just there for breeding and I would still rather with be stuck on Gilligans Island with only pictures of Condoleezza Rice then find myself stranded there.The most entertaining part about this movie was the guy who ripped the loudest fart I've ever heard in a movie theater. That's not a joke nor is it fictional. I've never been to a "thriller" and heard so much laughter through out the entire film. I can't tell you with an certainty if the laughs were intentional in some effort to lighten the cinematic tension or if they just really thought this crud would actual fly. I honestly found myself routing for a power outage or a perhaps a fight to break out in the movie theater, anything to make this more interesting which is pretty sad since Deez, Powder and I pounded 2 beers each before the film just for a little mental anesthesia (soon to be a law before all Nic Cage films, write to your congressman today, don't delay). At one point I actually thought perhaps this movie is really a spoof and Anna Ferris is going to show up?oh how I wish.Nic Cage throws out so much ham per frame I'm thinking of having a cholesterol test done today. To think that I ever thought Sean Penn was a d*ck for slamming Nic's acting, oh he's still a d*ck just lesser of one?yes Sean Penn's d*ck was lessened because of this film. Do us all a favor Nic play your strengths and stick to being pathetic losers and drunks. You cannot play superman you do not get to play strong hunky roles go straight to jail do not pass go do not collect 200 dollars. His best moments in this film are when he finally comes unhinged and actually punches out a burly woman to steal her bear suit (like the fart, not a joke or a functional moment during this review) then proceeds to run amok like Conan O'Brian's masturbating bear, but with half the hilarity of a bear knocking his junk around. Thankfully he meets his end shortly after when it turns out he's to be a sacrifice to the crowd at the new tour hybrid show of Burning Man and Lilith Fair. Yes!!!! I just spoiled the ending for you?and if you knew any better you'd build statues of me in worship and sing songs of my legend. I sat through this crap-fest so you don't have to.About half way through this little misadventure I kept thinking to myself Jack Bauer would have wrapped this case up in 20 minutes of real time..OK 35 minutes if Kim gets attacked by a mountain lion first. Even Steve Martin as Inspector Clouseau could have figured this out in under an hour?and you Sir are no Inspector Clouseau.If for some reason you are taken captive and you have a choice to see this film or take a bullet, take the bullet.Somewhere Uwe Boll is laughing at us all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, finally got to see the remake last night in London, unintentionally hilarious, sexless and devoid of any real humour. I don't really know where to start, whilst I was entertained by this strange homage, it didn't really move me. The acting is screamingly hammy, there is no original music, the costumes are far too 'Disney' there is a ridiculous 'six months later' insert after the burning of Nic Cage (which didn't come soon enough for my liking) The bit with Cage in the bear suit had the audience suppressing mirth as did the comedy punching out of various 'baddies' on the island. It's such a weird remake that I cant quite believe I saw it, it reminded me of something that The Comic Strip presents would have done in the eighties, a bit like their Hollywood interpretation of the Miner's Strike, very strange!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are there no good horror/mystery/thrillers being made any longer?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen the 1973, older highly rated version. I am a Nicholas Cage fan (by the way, fine acting as usual). This movie probably took all of five minutes to hammer out the whole plot (I can see it being done on a cocktail napkin at a dinner party), if you can't figure out the ending of this drool in the first thirty minutes you will probably find this movie entertaining. This is, of late, the terrible rut that Hollywood seems to have dug for itself with the horror/mystery/thriller genre, unable to give the audience enough credit and write a fresh, smart, and tantalizing screenplay, they dish out some creepy music and throw in a couple of things to make you jump a little and then send the final print off to your local theater. At least, it didn't have the jiggling hand-held camera syndrome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha Wow this remake SUCKS!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes laughter in the middle of a horror film is a signal of its greatness. I remember the nervous laughter from the audience in the re-release of The Excorcist? really nervous laughter. It punctuated just how freaked out we all were watching the voice of Satan coming out of a 12 year old girl. In the case of the 2006 remake of the 1972 cult classic The Wicker Man however, it made me think that this new Wickerman is about as scary as the South Park character, Scuzzlebut, the friendly forest monster with TV's Patrick Duffy for a leg and a celery stalk for an arm who's favorite hobby is weaving wicker baskets.3 years ago a friend of mine in Hollywood told me that he heard that Nicolas Cage was going to do a remake of the film. I started laughing and my friend (Keith) got mad at me touting Nicolas Cage as a great actor. I just didn't think that he could pull it off and unfortunately for moviegoers I was right. Gone is the realness, the outstanding original music, the originality, the creepiness and the wonderfully powerful dialogue. Instead we have horror movie clichés, affected acting and changes to the storyline that make any believability fall apart. Like many of the countless Hollywood remakes we have been inundated with lately this feels like we are watching 4th graders on a playground "playing Wickerman".The original film takes place on a remote Scottish Isle where a Scottish police officer is lured there to find a missing young girl named Rowan Morrison. In the new spin a California cop (Cage) is lured to an island of the coast of Washington state by his ex-girlfriend to find her missing daughter. She sends a photo and the missing daughter looks exactly like a young girl he tried to save in a fiery crash not long ago. The crash still haunts him in part because the girl's body was never found. Yet even after he gets a letter with her picture in it that connection is completely cast aside as he heads north, alone, to help his ex-girlfriend find her daughter. He arrives to find an island full of actors pretending to be the descendants of Wiccans, many of whom seem like they didn't get call backs for roles in The Village. And like The Village it isn't long before you realize there is nothing to be afraid of here. Not even the cloudy eyed blind sisters who speak in unison.I think that the opportunity in Hollywood to make great amounts of money on a film often comes at great expense to the artistry. I think someone like Nicolas Cage who is in so many films these days loses touch with the magic that film can be when it gets to the point where he has a personal chef on the set preparing his snacks. We needed a bad re-make of the Wickerman like we needed yet another '9-11' movie. I'm starting to wonder if Nicolas changed his surname from Coppola because he wanted to or because he was pleaded with to do so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They shouldn't have sacrificed the script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wicker Man is a horror movie by virtue of the fact that it occasionally jumps out at you, is dark, and wants to disturb you with its strange imagery. Horror movies are not always scary, but mostly because audiences have become desensitized to the tricks and traps of filmmakers over the years trying to give us the willies. That said, The Wicker Man is one of the most unintentionally hilarious movies of the year and well worth your time, if only to be mocked.Officer Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) finds himself in the middle of a drug-addled bender after failing to save an atypically creepy horror movie child from an exploding car. He grieves and pops pills, probably because he wasn't harmed in the blast, despite having his head in the car window. Then, he receives a letter from his ex-girlfriend, Willow (Kate Beahan). It seems Willow is living on a private island now and her child is missing, possibly secreted away by the very people she is living with! As an audience, we already know that the daughter belongs to Cage, since such a thing would be far more dramatic and give him ample reason to turn Summerisle upside down. But Edward Malus does not realize this. Perhaps he is too busy being distracted by the Neo-Pagan Amish community that lives on the island, where men are kept submissive by the powerful female Sisters that run the place. Or it could be he is preoccupied by all of the bee hives around the island, since the Sisters of Summerisle deem it to be their most important crop. Are we surprised that Malus has an allergy to bees? It never really is explained how the people of Summerisle sustain themselves on just honey.Whatever the reason, Malus bumbles around the island, growing increasingly more and more horrified by the events transpiring around him. A feminist bitch teaching an English class about the atrocities of men? Clearly this island is the bastion of Satan himself. Ah, but we find a clue here. Despite the fact that all of the residents of the island insist that there is no girl, there is a single unoccupied desk in the middle of class. Cage then opens the desk, only to be startled by a crow and screams "What?!" At that point, we are thinking along the same lines.But hold on: these are the best parts of the film. Up until now, the plot hasn't started to collapse in on itself, though we can see the stress fractures running along the edges. Malus spots a girl in the distance after popping some more pills in the middle of the night and gives chase into a nearby barn, where he barely escapes death and completely fails to thrill us. Undaunted, he continues to be lied to by everyone on the island, including his ex-girlfriend, who seems to watch everything transpire like a deer in the headlights. We know she is up to no good, though she could at least pretend to care.Finally, we have some revelations. It seems young, misplaced Rowan was born during a harvest year when the crops failed. Dear god, they are going to sacrifice her to save their honey! Based on this hunch, Malus then punches out an Innkeeper, karate chops Leelee Sobieski into submission, ducks into a bear costume, and sneaks into the ceremony to save the little girl that may or may not be the subject of a sacrifice. But then, we stopped taking The Wicker Man seriously a long time ago. Perhaps it would be easier to take the movie as seriously as it does if Nicolas Cage wasn't flailing around like a drunk in half of his scenes. Or maybe the movie is just bad by default.I wouldn't dream of giving the ending away, but it is far less effective than that of the original movie, which I decided to watch after seeing this. It almost feels as though this version of The Wicker Man was pulled together through vague recollections of the original after a long night of alcohol abuse. It's not necessarily a bad thing to try out new stuff with old material, but the minute your hero comes to the rescue dressed as a bear, you should know something has gone horribly awry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We were drawn to this movie by the quality actors starring - Nicholas Cage and Ellen Burstyn. Now that we wasted our $19 to see it, we can't imagine what they were thinking when they signed up to be included in this drivel. There was no suspense, no redeeming qualities whatsoever.The worst part was hanging around till the end, hoping all along that there was a reason worth staying for, only to find out that there was none. And the girl who played willow had a few too many collagen injections in her lips.At the end of the movie, we felt like we and all the others in the theater had been had and a demeaning joke played on us all. If you are reading this after having seen the movie, you have our sympathies...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Classic" for the wrong reasons!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a horror movie, its a 1 out of 10, but as a Comedy, its at least an 8 out of 10. Nicolas Cage's character had me in stitches in so many places, because his acting in this movie is SO bad its hilarious! The last 30 minutes of the movie is pure gold! He punches women constantly, can't figure out people are lying to him, threatens kids, attacks in a bear suit, and has so many unintentionally funny one-liner quotes its just ridiculous, such as "HOWDIDITGETBURNED", "NO! NOT THE BEES!", and "Killing me won't bring back your goddamn honey!". Hell, even the ending of the movie was funny somehow! I saw this at the cinema too, and the audience were laughing as well! It's totally worth buying on DVD as its dirt cheap now.Ironically though, the "Director's Cut" is supposed to make it more horror-like, but it actually makes the movie even funnier! In conclusion, its a 'classic' for the wrong reasons!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I managed to get into a screening of the remake of the wicker man the other day, and have to say that i was pretty entertained by it. Being a life time horror movie fan, and having (obviously) seen the original, I was interested to see what this new school would bring to the story. From what I can see on the message boards, it looks like not many of the die-hard wicker fans are too enthused by the idea of a remake, but for the most part their fears can be put to rest (if they will allow). The remake DEFINITELY retains AND even ADDS to the the atmospheric slowly boiling sense of dread and and wonder (I.E. WHAT THE F**K!?!?), leading up to the inevitable ending which left me with a much more haunted feeling that even seeing the original for the first time. I do have to warn you that if you are not a Nicholas Cage fan, this will not be a role to win you over- there are parts where it is painful to watch him. Everything else is relatively flawless though- if you let yourself get into the movie, you honestly feel as if you are on an isolated island where the "old ways" are still very relevant to society, something that even the original couldn't seem to do if you looked closely enough. The story is definitely fleshed out a bit, and if you're open to a new take on the story I think you'll have a great movie-going experience. I think that the important thing to remember here is that it's a movie- a brief distraction from real life whose purpose is to entertain- NOT a commentary on paganism.This "remake" actually manages to stand on it's own as a new entry into the horror archives. Does it have its problems? of course it does, what movie doesn't? remake or not. It reminded me of the differences between the original Ringu and the Naomi Watts/ Gore Verbinski version- i think both are outstanding entries into the horror world, both offering many different things. Of course there is always the one that came first, but sometimes the "original" can be re-tooled and have new life breathed into it. As a side-note- even if you HATE what they've done with the story/actors they chose- the cinematography is absolutely otherworldly here, with very little emphasis on special effects, and much more creative uses of natural landscapes and tricks of light- i give THAT a 15!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A low point in cinema history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At this point in entertainment history saleability has become the leading factor in determining a project's go ahead. Every successful film of the last 40 years (even those of Asia and Europe)is being remade and mostly with disastrous results. Of all the hideous reinterpretations of recent years The Wicker Man takes the prize for the worst. The original 1973 film is a believable masterpiece with a setting, although a fantasy, that has an authenticity due to it having drawn on a real history. The re-make is a misguided attempt to relocate this historically founded story to a country that isn't old enough to have had such beliefs. The entire symbolism of the original is lost. Blind faith, virginity, ignorance, self-righteousness and temptation lead the original cop through the maze of experience to prove his worthiness. Nicholas Cage has none of these traits and is just a pawn in a ludicrous plot. The only good thing about this film is it has rekindled people's desire to see the original again and experience it's hypnotic charm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No, not the bees!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite hearing nothing but negative reviews, I had to see this film for myself. So I waited until the backlash had died down a little and went into it with an open mind. Hell, I might even enjoy it, I thought. What followed was to be quite possibly the dullest 2 hours of my life I have ever spent in front of the TV. It was bad. But unfortunately did not fall within the 'so bad it's good' category.At first it was hard to pinpoint exactly where the problems lie. The film looks gorgeous; there's no faulting the cinematography or mise-en-scene. The storyline is essentially the same as the original, which I enjoyed and continue to enjoy, so what exactly is wrong with this 2006 version? WHY is it so dull? The reasons being the following: a flat, dire performance from Cage, and from everyone else involved (including Burstyn, who appears non-committal and uninterested); a slow, pondering narrative that desperately wants to be taken as thoughtful and philosophical; 'action' set pieces that verge on the ridiculously mundane (bee's anyone?); and, maybe more importantly than anything else - Cage rushing around on a bicycle. How very quaint.Unfortunately, being a remake, comparisons are going to be drawn. Everything that made the original a brilliant film is missing here - the creepy atmosphere, the performances, the songs, the eroticism (Willow's song being a highlight). But at least it's got the same ending, right? Well, yes and no. It has an ending where the same thing happens but, this being the noughties, a little extra has to be added to make it all more 'disturbing'.********************SPOILERS**************************************Hobbling? Bees? Okay, maybe a nice pair of additions for some, but Cage's cries of 'No, not the bees!' was the only moment of unintentional entertainment for me in this dull, lifeless mockery of a film.I don't normally vote a score of 1 for anything, as I usually see some merit in everything I see. Yes, the cinematography was excellent, but it is not enough to save this film from being a relentless 2 hours of drudgery.Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reaction after watching this movie: Wow!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My reaction shortly after watching the movie is, WOW!There are three types of good movies. Ones based on: plot, message, both. After watching this thing, I was really angry. Not so much at the movie, but at myself for obviously having somehow missed something in the movie that would explain everything and tie the whole thing (either the plot or the message) together in some way...then I glanced at the reviews of critics and other viewers; it finally settled in. My subconscious suspicions were correct. This is no message. There is no plot. One sometimes comes across movies that have obviously been padded with extra material, to lengthen the movie. This material usually does not tie in into the story in any way. This movie definitely has a lot of padding, but it appears that the producers forgot to insert the actual movie to go along with the padding. It feels like the entire movie is actually a spliced version of all of the Deleted Scenes of another bad movie.*Spoiler warning (although I am not sure how this would spoil anything)* Things that do not make any sense or whose purpose is never explained: 1. Motivational Tape 2. The whole accident in the beginning 3. Hallucinations of the cop thereafter 4. The awkward visit of the female cop 5. ANY of the unnatural phenomenon that happens on the island (weird looking man in the bed, woman with a whole bunch of bees on her, etc) 6. The whole allergy thing (what is the point of even mentioning that?) 7. The stupidity of the main character and his inability to ask the most obvious questions of those he "interviews" 8. The complexity of the entire scheme to get Edward to the field at the end 8. Although the above pretty much covers the entire 102 minutes, there is something else that does not tie in at all; Every other scene in the movie. Really.I am guessing that the climax of the movie was supposed to be the death of the protagonist; however, his stupidity and annoying nature make the viewer care very little about his ultimate demise. There is no climax in this movie. Things just...happen - for no reason. I would have felt more sorry if the little girl fell and bruised her leg on her way to burn him. Actually, I probably wouldn't care either. This movie would actually get two stars from me if it had Jim Carrie play the main character and have a few bad jokes thrown in here and there. At least we would then have some hint that the director was trying to make things look bad on purpose.What is so sad about this movie is that the acting was rather bad as well. The reason why this is unfortunate is because there are a few really good actors in this movie (Nicolas Cage obviously being the most apparent). Unfortunately, because of the stupidity of the movie they had absolutely no chance in ever getting into character. Mr. Cage would have a better chance portraying a Russian Birch tree than playing this character. At least the tree has physical characteristics, nonsense does not.THE PROS: The "quality" of the post-production effects and cinematography. Basically, the quality of the way things look is better than that of raw footage.P.S. I honestly believe that those who say that they see something in this movie are the same people who stare at unoriginal abstract paintings painted by an uncreative child. The people realize that the painting is crap, but they do not wish to look odd or not intelligent enough in front of those who are wondering and saying the same thing. Let me put your peoples' minds at rest -- there is really nothing to this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An utter waste of time and effort.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edward Malus (Nic Cage) is a cop traumatised after he witness an accident in which a mother and daughter are killed. While on leave he receives a letter from an old flame who's daughter has gone missing. Travelling to Summersisle to try and find the missing girl he finds himself among an isolated community where things clearly aren't what they seem. As his investigation starts he finds age old practises have been unearthed, including human sacrifice on the isolated island. Rapidly finding himself out of his depth he begins to lose control of his situation with devastating consequences.Anyone who loved the original Wicker Man like I do should steer well clear of this awful mess. While this is an interesting (to start with) psychological drama with some interesting twists it rapidly drops into farce. At several points I found myself, along with almost all the rest of the audience, laughing out loud. Not what you should be doing in a film billed as a horror/thriller.Cage is okay as the weirded out cop with a past. Kate Beahan as Sister Willow, his lost love, is striking but a character you want to slap every time she's on screen. The rest of the assembled weirdo's you can distrust right from the start. The outstanding cast member (and not for the right reasons) is Ellen Burstyn as Sister Summersisle. What a waste of talent. A veteran of films including The Exorcist, she's one of the most laughable villains in recent years.Why a 5/10 then? Sadly it does entertain for all the wrong reasons.Avoid like the plague or wait until it hits the rental shops.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misguided rethink of a classic horror story is destined to be forgotten and a major misstep in the careers of most involved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoilers ahead) Neil LaBute continues his misogynistic ways with a retelling of Anthony Shaffer's classic horror story. The story of a policeman called to a remote island to investigate the disappearance of a little girl, only to find that there is more afoot has been re-imagined as the tale of a lost soul trying to find redemption in a matriarchal community.The changes LaBute has made have destroyed most of the thematic elements and under currents that have made the original resonate still 30 years after it was first produced. In place of the originals battle between Christianity and paganism we have a nightmare of clever woman doing terrible things to a man who wants to get his soul back. LaBute has made one of the ultimate women are evil films of all time. Some have found the changes empowering, I find them misogynistic since it clearly shows why he's made a career out of abusing women in his films: women will toy with you before destroying you. Its an ugly message.LaBute also made changes to the story that hobble it in the telling. One of the key changes is that the young girl maybe Nicholas Cages'. While this may give Nicholas Cage a reason to go, it creates some rather odd exchanges between Cage and the mother of the missing girl. Very little of what passes between them makes any sense at all. Its a mess, but then the restructuring of the society diminishes much of the tension because we are clearly somewhere else; its not, as in the original film a place that could almost be anywhere, until you peal off the layers. There IS a tension, but that comes from clearly being in a place one shouldn't. Granted the change does create a bit more fear at times (since the monster is clearly in view and we are waiting for it to strike), but it never achieves the real horror of the original which explodes at the end as not only the mystery is stripped away but also the beliefs of the central character. (And lets not even talk about the need for the 6 month later ending) As if the script wasn't bad enough the film is also badly acted. Nicholas Cage at times gives a performance that ranks among his worst, which is not an easy task since he is one of Hollywood best and worst actors of all time. Cage had me in tears of embarrassed laughter at times, so much so that I can end any discussion of the rest of the cast here since as bad as some of them are, they aren't that bad.On the plus side there are some striking images and some unease, due no doubt to the stories inherent power and to LaBute's refashioning the story to put monster front and center.Pluses or no this film is a major misfire. Its a really bad bad (unfun) movie that should be avoided. Its more proof that some times people who know better do bad things, not that anyone should have to go looking for more proof.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Wicker Man" is not a good movie. There, now that that's out of the way, I can tell you that this movie is certainly worth seeing. Not in the way you would think of it, however, because "The Wicker Man" is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I would rank it up there with "Airplane!" and "Monty Python and the Holy Grail." What's the best part about this? This film is supposed to be a horror movie. I wasn't scared at all. In fact, I couldn't be scared, or even shocked, because there were parts where I couldn't stop laughing. The acting is terrible. Nicolas Cage is an incredibly wooden actor, delivering almost all of his lines in the same monotone voice, (although the more memorable parts of this movie are when he gets angry). The plot...? What plot, this movie makes no sense at all. And when the point of the movie is to scare the audience, this movie fails miserably. The music also sometime seems incredibly inappropriate, even laughable.So if you can stand the bad parts of this movie, and enjoy it as it should be watched, you may find yourself a "Wicker Man" fan.

		<shortDescription>Why even try? This movie should never be remade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some films that are classics and should never ever be remade, no matter who doe sit or stars in it. Casablanca is one, the Wicker Man is another. In 1973 an amazing film came out that was timeless in its execution and became an example of great film making using subtle psychology and a weaving plot line that culminated in a sublime piece of work. In 2006 a piece of crap was slapped onto the silver screen and tainted the name and memory of that classic. not only wa sit an unnecessary remake it was a horrible remake. Contrived plot twists tried to pay homage (if defecating on the hand of the one you wish to pay respect to is "homage") to a classic and continuously made not so subtle references to the superior original. it was crap, it took a bad idea and made it worse. Don't even see this one for free on a dare. It is just plane awful in every way. the convoluted resolution of character relationships place an unbelievable Nic Cage as not only the victim of the towns need to sacrifice for a poor honey yield (bees? really? god I want to vomit just remembering) with forced twists it is reveled not only is he the estranged father of Rowan, but the girls mother is responsible for the unlikely chain of events that lead Nic to his doom with the Wickerman. Not only should Nic have been burned, all prints should have been burned, and all those responsible for this POS film need to be sacrificed as an apology for disrespecting the original classic.

I must warn anyone who has yet to see the 1973 classic that there are prints with about 12 minutes cut floating around, so be sure and get a copy that runs 100 minutes! Last but not least, the remake is hilarious and inspired all these equally hilarious reviews. I just spent the last hour laughing so hard my jaws and ribs hurt.

		<shortDescription>Among The Most God-Awful Films I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is good to, every now and then, come across a film that reminds us what exactly the bottom of the barrel looks like. And sometimes the films that do this can be surprising. I never thought a film starring Nicholas Cage would do it; but it does. This film is not just the bottom of the barrel. It's below the bottom of the barrel. It's underneath the dirt under the bottom of the barrel. It's underneath the worms in the dirt under the bottom of the barrel. This film reminds me why it is sometimes appropriate that film and filth begin with the same three letters. Nicholas Cage stars in this monstrosity as Officer Edward Malus who is searching for a girl named Rowan Woodward (hold on: Edward? Woodward? Wasn't Edward Woodward the name of the lead actor from the original film?) who lived on an island before mysteriously vanishing. But, if I lived on that island, I would mysteriously vanish too. This island is full of idiots and ridiculously silly actors and customs, all of which culminates in some of the most ludicrously outlandish traditions I've ever heard of. And I do mean that *every* *single* actor in this movie is god-awful. In fact, by comparison with some of the ridiculous actors and actresses he has to share the screen with, by the middle of the movie, Nicholas Cages's nonsensical, confusingly bad acting started to look like Robert DeNiro.But, to be fair, I cannot blame these actors for their awful acting. This screenplay was terrible. It was one of the top three most dreadfully awful screenplays I've ever heard in my life. And I have a theory for this. I think the writer of this screenplay only spoke a little bit of broken English but had seen the original Wicker Man and decided to throw in some of the lines to make it seem the same. Because there are a lot of the same lines that were in the original film in this one, but without any of the intelligence.And I don't think I've ever seen a movie full of so many plot holes; not since Battlefield Earth (never a good comparison). I found myself asking questions like "Why did they kill the pilot that brought Edward to the island if they wanted him brought to the island? Why does Malus come across the beehives so easily when they were in plain sight and he knew he was allergic? Why were all of the four dream sequences important? Where were they keeping Rowan throughout the movie? How come no one can act? How come Malus didn't ask about why that woman was covered from head to toe in bees? Is the movie seriously not going to address that?"And a lot of times, these scenes got really stupid really fast. For instance, Malus (god that's a stupid name) walks into a classroom and pleasantly says "Wow. School's changed since I was a kid." The teacher screams--literally screams--at him "Why are you frightening my students!?!" I'm sorry, why was what he said frightening? Did I miss something here?Yes, this movie's greatest sacrifice was the logic. There was no logic. People started yelling at each other for no reason. The movie was full of plot holes. It was just plain stupid. And the dream sequences! I cannot stand dream sequences in movies, and this movie had way too many of them that didn't go anywhere! Nothing makes me angrier than pointless dream sequences!And this music! I was sick of this music. It's not that it was bad music; it was that the music did not belong in the movie. There was far too much of it that was trying to make the movie feel spooky. In the original film, they never tried to make it feel spooky. We didn't feel spooked until the end, and the contrast worked beautifully. Here, we just get sick of the music.The Wicker Man is among the most god-awful films I've ever seen. The dialogue sucks, the acting is dreadfully bad, the logic is nonexistent, it's full of plot holes, and even the effects, when there were any, were ridiculously awful. This whole movie was ridiculously awful. It has no redeeming qualities.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1/3 fun-bad movie, 2/3 just... boring, poorly acted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neil La Bute should hang his head in shame for this remake of the 1973 cult film The Wicker Man. While I've not seen all of the original Anthony Shaffer scripted film starring Christopher Lee (I can't remember it very well, but certain images and the overall manic Scottish-folk aspect stick out in my mind), I could imagine it at least being a somewhat original story. This new version, however, is cluttered with boring procedural business that is made all the more yawn-like (or befuddling, take your pick) by how Nicolas Cage's character- a cop who has no jurisdiction in this enclave of SummerIsle he's at- bungles from one place to the next looking for a little girl.And what does Neil LaBute do to make it more accessible to audience's today, those who might have found the original film too Scottish or weird or done practically as a witch-gazing musical? He amps it up with misogyny, which was not really in the Shaffer script, with Cage as the lone man against an entire colony of brainwashed "B-words" who have it coming to them when Cage lays the smack-down on them. Granted, there is something unintentionally hilarious seeing Nicolas Cage- at this stage in his long and lustrous career- punching out a woman while in a bear costume. But a lot of it is just... cruel, kind of, which apparently has been running around in LaBute's catalog of work (while not as strong in Nurse Betty, In the Company of Men has been charged with it).One might consider it too ridiculous to seriously critique as nothing more than a below-average Hollywood-ized remake of another movie that fans hold so dear the only way to pay it tribute is to spend millions on a piece of quality, mediocre BS. But it's also from a director of certain prestige like LaBute, starring a bona-fide star like Cage, with supporting parts filled in by the likes of Ellen Burstyn, and it just all adds up to the embarrassment level. So much of this is just procedural crap, stuff of asking boring questions and boring (or just befuddling) scenes of inquiry or 'wacky' peril involving the bees, which by the (alternate) ending becomes the whole reason to see the movie.Certainly it's not for Cage, who doesn't even have the good graces to make it an awesomely-bad ride like he did with Ghost Rider. He grimaces and does non-emoting better (or worse) than anyone out there, and he's starting to go down peg after peg with his career of total duds (i.e. this, Ghost Rider, Next, Bangkok Dangerous) or safe hits (National Treasure). He needs something else of a challenge, not refashioned and almost worthless stuff like the Wicker Man to chew on, since he isn't untalented. Maybe a trip back to re-work the obvious plastic surgery and the hair-piece would do the trick as a *middle-aged man*.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a freakin' joke! The 1973 version of The Wicker Man is a true classic and one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen. The final scenes have lost nothing and remain as strong today as they were over 30 years ago. The 2006 version of The Wicker Man manages to take most everything that made the original such a wonderfully compelling piece of cinema and chuck it out the window. How you can take out the religious and sexual aspects that were a focus of the original story and still call it The Wicker Man? And what do you use to replace the religious and sexual aspects so key to understanding the central character? Bees! Yes, that's right ? bees, for God's sake! What an insult! There's a story that the original negatives of the 1973 film were buried in a landfill under a roadway in England. Why couldn't it have been the 2006 abomination?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Next year, Neil LaBute.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of the original Wicker Man. I found it darkly delightful and wholly original. LaBute has adapted that gem of a screenplay into this appalling train wreck. In order to manage this, he had to make every conceivably wrong decision during the adaptation. It is as if he carefully analyzed the original to identify the elements that made it work so well, and then dislodged every single one of them.The policeman is no longer devoutly religious, smugly "just the facts" and virginal. Instead he is so traumatized by an incident in his past that he sees visions every fifteen minutes. The island and its people are no longer sunny and joyful in their oddity. Instead they all act as if they had just stepped off the cover of a Black Sabbath album. The islanders are no longer focused on fertility and abundance (despite their language);Their culture is now all about matriarchal rule, an element that serves the story in no way whatsoever. Finally, and most inexplicably, the film is PG-13, robbing it of the ability to portray in any effective way key aspects of the islanders' beliefs that in the original went a long way toward unhinging the policeman.That LaBute has so completely destroyed a great story is something of an improbable accomplishment. While I concur with the many other reviewers that just about every aspect of this film sucks, the majority of the credit must be reserved for Neil LaBute. Burdened by this screenplay, the rest of the cast and crew did not stand a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RenFest Feminazi Hobbits Go Wilding On World's Worst Actor!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The worst actor of our generation, the male Elizabeth Berkley (Showgirls), Nicholas Cage, walks out in the middle of the road to pick up a brat's doll, causing an 18 wheeler to swerve and hit the car the girl is in. The girl and the mother die. Serves them both right, that little monster would be riding in a pet kennel if I was the mommy.So of course he's tragic over it. We know this because he constantly pops pills out of this one regular sized medicine bottle. He pops them so much that obviously they aren't strong enough because if they were he would have been dead from an OD already and there is no way the pill bottle could hold that many pills, as often as he pops them. And I do mean POP. He moves like a sloth, except when he's got some pills in his hand. Then it's like a boa constrictor on a mouse.He receives an unpostmarked letter (the only plausible thing in this movie, since the USPS is so AFU) from his ex, her daughter has gone missing. The letter is written in very pretty, neat calligraphy, or as I call it, HobbitFont. He goes up to some island in Washington, complete with bad CGI waves, and barges in to look for her.Firstly, let it be said that I'm not homophobic. In fact, I'm a big ole Ikea-shopping, Hillary-loving fudge packer. But as soon as he sets foot on the island, he encounters every female PE teacher that has ever lived, if you catch my drift. I think I saw Large Marge in there. The stereotypes were so broadly drawn that I am truly surprised there wasn't a WNBA game at some point in this movie. And their clothing! They're all dressed like something out of a Renaissance Festival, or the Lord of the Rings, or one of those planets that Star Trek The Next Generation was always landing on. Same difference. You just know that none of them shave their armpits. And they cackle this hysterically funny evil witches' laugh. I can only imagine how many tries it took to get the entire cast to laugh like that on cue without cracking up. And the only 2 men on the island are mute. And the young females are ALL pregnant. Work it Amish Pimps!So our Nic informs everyone, loudly, he is a police officer and is looking for a missing girl. But he is a policeman from California in Washington on private property, it is pointed out by the barkeep, who serves mead. MEAD? When is Gollum going to pop out? Nic does find his precious, she's this Fiona Apple look alike who is always crying and seems to have some form of autism preventing her from speaking complete or coherent sentences. But to her advantage, she's got this waif hobbit-chic thing going on and her pits are shaved and she looks adorable.Cut to spoilers: Her daughter is missing and is on the island and is Nic's daughter, but he's sooooo completely oblivious to the weirdness going on, he just keeps yelling louder and louder and flashing his badge and obviously these diesels are getting irritated. I can understand why, the worlds loudest, stupidest man is ordering them around. One moment, he's deathly allergic to bee stings. The next time he's stung, he lives. Come to find out, Fiona went out into the world to get knocked up, and then had daddy Nic come back to the island so they could sacrifice him in a pagan ritual (they need a blood connection), so their honey harvest would be better next year. (Oh I forgot to mention, this is a commune that produces honey for a living. I'm sure Whole Foods sells it. I would buy their honey just for what they do to Nicholas Cage, keep reading.) They get the pagan feminazi thing SOOO incredibly wrong that I can see Jerry Falwell using this movie around the next election to terrify his Sheepublicans into voting against that dangerous womyn Hillary. The movie ends on a very satisfying note however, with them breaking his kneecaps, then hoisting him up to the top of the Burning Man dude, and then burning him alive. Set it and forget it! But since Ghost Man just came out, it wasn't real, unfortunately they didn't actually crisp out Nicholas Cage. Well damn.Other highlights: 1. Leelee Sobriety or whatever her name is, jumping on Nic and screeching and pulling his hair. He knocks her out by throwing her against the wall, and her face shot as she loses consciousness had me howling. There is no way she did this movie for anything but the money.2. Nicholas Cage in a bear suit. Don't ask me how or why. In fact, everyone in masks and animal costumes. And dancing Renfest / LOTR maidens. Maidens! Furries! Were the Flaming Lips shooting a video on the island at the same time? 3. Ellen Burstyn having fun with her ridiculous role in an awful movie. She's such a brilliant actress, and part of being a good actor is knowing when you're in a turkey bomb of a movie so it's OK if you just go wild and do your absolute worst, and you still get paid.4. "Step AWAY from the bike!"5. "OH NO THE BEESAAAAAAAAHOHMYGODDDD BEES IN MY EYES!"This movie is Showgirls bad, which is ultimately a compliment. It's so bad it's funny. If you want a good laugh and are, like me, a connoisseur of unintentional camp and really terrible movies, then rent it and grab a bottle of tequila on the way home. Yes it's true, of all the bad movies in 2006, we were blessed with one so awful that you can turn it into a drinking game.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst and funniest movie I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is an inadvertently amusing romp through the potential for disasters in Hollywood remakes. Initially I thought it might be an intelligent spoof. About 20 minutes in all hope of this level of self-awareness is dashed, as you realise that the film-makers are actually *serious*.The brilliant subtlety in the development of Howie's character in the original is completely lost here. Cage comes in screaming, he screams and flails about the whole way through, adding punching women randomly to his repertoire as the film progresses. There's none of the clever thematic development, or the twists and turns of the original. We learn nothing of the equivalent parts of Lord Summerisle, May Morrison or the Innkeeper.Nonetheless, the remake is *extremely* amusing, and I'd recommend it on that basis. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard at a film's denouement. Just be sure to retain your sense of humor.</fullReview>

To be fair, both the plot (an over-complimentary term in this case) and the dialogue (I've seen better in a Desperate Dan comic) were abysmally bad, but Cage obviously decided to cope with their deficiencies by simply shouting as loud as he could. The rest of the cast didn't do any better, and the direction was formulaic; a *big* mistake in a remake of one of the most original and seminal films of the seventies.Anthony Shaffer and Robin Hardy can rest easy, this turkey won't be remembered for more than five minutes, and only that long because of how truly awful it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet ANOTHER horror-film remake. This one is really quite bad. It has taken over the nonsense from the 1973 original ? minus the great music and the atmosphere. So what are we left with here? With dull, badly acted garbage, with silly dialogues and even some unintentionally unfunny moments! The premise could be labeled more-or-less original ? if only this weren't just a remake ? but it is also a silly premise. The story is full of gaping holes in logic, there are many inconsistencies, the characters are not believable, and the director has failed to create a mood ? which is essential for this kind of story to work on the screen. Cage is dull and uninteresting, and his character's detective work shoddy and even laughable. The rest of the cast isn't much better, but then again, they didn't have much to work with here. Check out Ellen Burstyn: she is barely recognizable, what with a half-dozen face-lifts that have turned her into something quite weird. Strictly for die-hard Cage fans, and people who are shipwrecked on an island, with only one movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Five reasons to watch The Wicker Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wicker Man, starring Nicolas Cage, is by no means a good movie, but I can't really say it's one I regret watching. I could go on and on about the negative aspects of the movie, like the terrible acting and the lengthy scenes where Cage is looking for the girl, has a hallucination, followed by another hallucination, followed by a dream sequence- with a hallucination, etc., but it's just not worth dwelling on when it comes to a movie like this. Instead, here's five reasons why you SHOULD watch The Wicker Man, even though it's bad: 5. It's hard to deny that it has some genuinely creepy ideas to it, the only problem is in its cheesy, unintentionally funny execution. If nothing else, this is a movie that may inspire you to see the original 1973 film, or even read the short story on which it is based.4. For a cheesy horror/thriller, it is really aesthetically pleasing. It's pretty obvious that it was filmed on location instead of using green screen or elaborate sets, so we get to see some very great scenery. There are also many nicely composed shots. It is a very good looking movie.3. Nicolas Cage is not so much an actor as he is a force of nature. Whether you're a fan of his or not, it seems as if it's impossible for Cage to play a "normal guy". There is always some kind of eccentricity or nerdiness he brings to the characters he plays, and personally, I am always fascinated by watching him in any movie he does. Whether Nicolas Cage is great or terrible, he always brings his unique energy into play, and he is never boring to watch. He is terrible in The Wicker Man, but in the most wonderful kind of way.2. A student could probably write a hell of a paper on this movie, as it seems to be the strongest anti-feminist movie ever made. "See?" you could write, "this is what happens when women are allowed to run a society!" Also, the similarities between this "Summersisle" society and a bee colony are pretty interesting and worth noting.1. If you're reading this, there's probably a good chance you may have seen a YouTube video that has become very popular: a collection of "highlights" from the movie, including Cage running around in a bear suit, and of course, the infamous "AAGHH!! THE BEES!! MY EYES!!!" line. These scenes are hilarious out of context, and they are still fairly funny while watching them in the film's entirety.I bought the used DVD at Blockbuster for about 5 dollars...when you work that out, it's about a dollar per reason. It's a pretty good deal.NOTE: The Unrated version of the movie is the best to watch, and it's better to watch the Theatrical version just for its little added on epilogue, which features a cameo from James Franco.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't build a house out of this "Wicker"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the recent vogue of remaking movies at a fair clip, writer-director Neil Labute has decided to turn his eye to the early 1970s minor cult classic The Wicker Man. The original has developed a following over the years and is generally well regarded. Unfortunately, the remake will probably be held in the same company. While not a terrible film, The Wicker Man is nevertheless not great by any imagination, occasionally sliding into the realm of unintentional self-parody.The film opens on police officer Edward Malus (Nicholas Cage), a motorcycle cop who is witness to a horrific traffic accident involving a young girl and her mother. Unable to shake the experience, Malus goes on an extended leave and then ends up receiving a letter from his ex-fiancée, Willow (Kate Beahan), that her daughter is missing and she needs his help to locate her. Malus travels to the remote island of Summersisle, a private commune that has developed a matriarchal hierarchy, where men are little better than pack mules. Malus is reunited with Willow and begins his investigation of the island, discovering a number of unusual habits and strange goings-on. None of the inhabitants acknowledge the existence of Rowan, Willow's daughter, even the leader of the group, Sister Summersisle (Ellen Burstyn). After some investigation, Malus becomes more and more convinced that not only is Rowan still on the island, but she may be the eventual subject of a ritualistic sacrifice to the naturalistic gods the people worship.The Wicker Man falls apart in a number of different ways, but no more detrimental than in the performance of Nicholas Cage. Cage, an effective actor in other films, has been known for his somewhat unorthodox style at times, and here he turns in what may be one of his worst performances ever. He overacts the role of Edward Malus to the extreme, often bordering on the ridiculous. It is difficult to not hold back giggles at times in some of his more "emotional" moments as he pushes the bounds of seriousness almost beyond their breaking point. It is difficult to say whether this is all Cage's fault or if some of the blame lay at the feet of director Labute, but either way, Cage's performance is a serious hindrance to the success of the film.Cage isn't the only one in the film that is not quite up to par in the performance category. Many of the actors overplay their parts, seemingly to increase the "weirdness" factor of the film, but again causing little but bewilderment for the audience. The word subtlety is not to be found in the vocabulary of this film. The only semi-decent performance on record is that of Burstyn in the role of Sister Summersisle. She is low-key and effective in the role of the leader who has what appears to be ulterior motives to her actions.Aside from the acting missteps, The Wicker Man lacks much in the way of any real suspense. There is little in the film to raise the hairs on your neck, although the film seems to want to try every so often. A few scenes try to head in this direction, but they almost all fail to pay off. Also, when the twists and turns are finally alluded to, you find yourself questioning some of the significant leaps of logic the script makes. A few of its "revelations" are so difficult to swallow that it is hard to even believe the whole of the structure of the film.Even so, The Wicker Man has a sometimes atmospheric setting , there are some occasional bits of creepiness and the ending will most likely leave you a bit taken aback. If Labute had dealt with some of the performance issues and ironed out some of the logic in The Wicker Man, it may have been a decent little thriller. But, in the end, it just turns out to be just another forgettable remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What was I expecting? It was a pointless remake of a classic British film starring Nicholas Cage and re set in the States.The first question I find myself asking is why did I watch this? Curiosity I think.It really is quite simply terrible. Nicholas Cage when given free reign is a destructive influence to a film. Here he out loons even himself in one of the strangest performances I have ever seen.Even writing about this film hurts. It's so utterly bad, I started doing the ironing to distract me. On a Sunday night.The Original film is slowburn with a quirky offbeat kinda feel.With a remake, all of the unknown plot points and twists from the first film would be apparent to the audience, so surely the impact would need to be replaced and the tension built through another means?Wells sadly in this film having Nic Cage run around punching women in the face whilst dressed as a bear is about as tense as it gets.Yes, that's right - he punches women whilst dressed as a bear.Dear me.Avoid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a horror film evokes more laughs than scares you know the film is in troubled waters. This remake starring Nicholas Cage is bad. Very bad. Let me explain why.The script is uninspired and lacking in psychological or physical scares. Rather it evokes unintentional laughter through crass lines and silly scenes. He is a police officer who can't tell the difference in weight between a loaded gun and an unloaded gun. He runs around in a bear costume at one point to blend in with the local celebration. You'd be forgiven for thinking this was Scooby Doo.The film lacks tension and logic. After the film you're left wondering why the islanders didn't just knock him out when his back was turned rather than continue the elaborate missing girl plan until the very end.The only enjoyment I took away from this was how unintentionally funny some scenes were. The aforementioned bear scene, Nicholas Cage pointing his gun at an unarmed woman to apprehend her bike and telling her to "step away from the bike", the villagers and their cuckoo ways, it all adds up to some comedy gold.But make no mistake. This is poor stuff. You gotta wonder why Nicholas Cage agreed to appear in this. Maybe he thought there was potential. It evokes the 1998 Psycho as another pointless poor remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull remake of Brit classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Maiden wrote a track based on the movie and it is superb. So something good has come out from the wicker man in recent years.When I heard that Neil Labute was going to make a remake of the 1970s cult pagan classic I was mystified. LaBute has not attempted to make a horror movie before. Why try it now? I really felt watching this movie LaBute wanted to make the same battle of the sex's movie he always makes. He has had three successes under his belt in the form of "In the company of men, Your friends and neighbours and the Shape of things" so how would he fair with this classic. We should all know the plot of this movie after all the front cover gives the game away on the original DVD. Man goes into closed society on the search for a missing girl. Everyone says she is dead, never lived there or are just unhelpful. Eventually the awful truth becomes apparent. Is it too late for Niccy Cage???This movie was a mess, the original subject matter was a well thought out piece about the inter meshing of paganism and modern day British culture. This movie plays like a re imagining more than a remake. LaBute has added his own ideas about a Celtic cult where the men are subservient to the women (this is one of his tried and trusted themes and in this movie it is an absolute failure). There is some stuff about bees that reminded me of the candy-man. Most ofit is has been set in a small island off the cost of America. This is another one of his ideas that does not work. The Island would have to be huge to have all the plant life that he has in it. I really wanted to like this movie but ended up hating it all the more for the way Labute completely misunderstood the characters. Woodward played the original character brilliantly with him being embarrassed by sex. Cage is a full red blooded American who has procreated and it is the fruit of his loins that it the object of his desire in this movie. Where could that pesky kid have got to? We all know but Cage appears not to know about the subject matter and plays it like he is John Wayne. The funniest parts of the movie are when he starts beating up of the women of the island.All in all I found this movie to be a dull pointless remake of a 1970s classic. Cage is terrible and very wooden throughout. The rest of the characters are not fleshed out and this makes the movie very hollow. This movie is a duffer that never should have been remade. 1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One poor re-imagination of the original pagan tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually came to watch this film with quite an open mind. I'm a big admirer of the original and have watched it more than once, and found the whole package quite exceptional. Sadly remakes are quite the fashion nowadays and in rare cases they can exceed or match the original. This one doesn't! They have re-written the original from its "Christian v Pagan" theme to some extreme feminist cult based in north-west USA. The acting is poor and Nicholas Cage is just annoying in the lead role (very unsuited to the part). The story is surprisingly boring and doesn't have the same creepy factor the original did.The settings are undeniably incredibly beautiful, but apart from that there is nothing of note in this film. It's dreadfully poor and even removes a number of the greatest aspects of the original.I'd tell you to give this a miss, but you might enjoy it for a laugh as one of those so bad it's worth watching for a laugh!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a dreadful attempt to remake Robin Hardy's The Wicker Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Giving this farrago 1 point is being generous. Even if you're not familiar with the original Wicker Man, this is poor stuff.I don't think Nicholas Cage is much of an actor at the best of times, but here he is really plumbing the depths. (I don't want to be rude to the man - but isn't he beginning to look like Frankie Howerd just before he started wearing a hairpiece?) Kate Beahan is even worse than him, and Ellen Burstyn can't save anything from the carnage. La Bute's buddy Aaron Eckhart does the best thing he can in the circumstances - he says his one line... and then vanishes, never to reappear.The film has no real mystery or tension about it; the opening scene (Nicholas Cage on a wretched motorbike yet again!) involving the car crash is never properly explained. The 'community' is unconvincing in the extreme, much less so than in, for instance, 'The Village.' Cage blundering through a field full of beehives batting off a bunch of angry bees is truly risible; by the time he's donning a bear costume, you'll be laughing your head off.One question: does Neil La Bute have a thing against men? He shows 1) how crass and sexist they are (In The Company of Men) 2) how easily they can be tricked and made fools of by women (The Shape Of Things) and 3) come to their just rewards in a world where women call all the shots. Conclusion: a bore, and a misconceived project in the first place. Watch the original first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Nick Cage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leave it to Nick Cage to star in a terrible re-make of one of my favorite horror/thriller movies of all time. Oh boy were to start,well first thing is that the acting was terrible. I mean I don't understand how you can have such an amazing actress such as Ellen Burstyn who was spectacular in Requiem for a Dream and still have such flat boring acting. Besides the acting they threw in some stupid plot lines that I don't recall being in the original.Then I get to my biggest problem, why in gods name is Nick Cage still being hired to star in movies. Nick Cage is the same character in every single movie the only actor in my eyes that is worse then Cage is Megan Fox and at least she is attractive and not a 40 something year old actor with fading talent. All in all I would not recommend this film to anyone unless your the kind of person who enjoys crappy re-makes of good movies and I know there are some of you out there. -S.o.t93</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wicker Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has been a lot of talk around this movie, most of all about its famous scenes with Nicolas Cage at his worst. I watched a Youtube-video with the "highlights" of this train wreck and it sounded like a lot of unintentional fun. Sadly, only a small part of the movie is like that. For the most time you're left with a very boring film and wonder yourself why the hell you decided to watch this movie. (Exception: You're watching it with the rifftrax, because than it is a really hilarious film)A cop named Edward is traumatized after he couldn't save a little girl from a car accident and as he receives a letter from his ex-girlfriend asking for help, he sees his chance for atonement. So he goes to Summersilse looking for his ex-girlfriend's daughter, but not everything is as it seems...The director for this film apparently wanted to give it a melancholy and deep touch, but he fails miserably and instead the movie just seems boring. The dialog isn't doing a lot to grab your interest either and something to lighten the mode only happens very rarely. Nicolas Cage is here at his craziest and even though he isn't very good in this movie, is the only saving grace. His madness was the only thing that kept me watching, because I was sure there would be another mad line of his. The other actors are pretty colorless and will be forgotten soon after.It's not the worst film I've ever seen (Manos, Red Zone Cuba &amp; others are way worse), but it's still quiet bad. Nicolas Cage delivers a few hilariously bad lines to save the movie from being rated worse</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In "The Wicker Man," Nicolas Cage travels to a commune on a far-away island (even though its in Washington) to find a missing girl that his old fiancé told him was missing.Of course, things aren't that simple, and as he tries to find answers from the dominantly female population, he's led in circles and is being fed false truths, which all cumulates to a climactic ending which involves Nicolas Cage in a bear costume.Yea, a bear costume."The Wicker Man" would be good if it wasn't for the fact that it sucked. The story made no sense, and the repetitiveness of the silence of the women on the island was just irritating...maybe it was the director's way of connecting Cage's irritation to that of the audience, but if that was the case, all he succeeded in was making the audience totally ticked off, especially at the end.</fullReview>

Despite my passion for movies, this is actually my first one. The Wicker Man is something I was prepared to not only type a review over, but register into IMDb 3AM in the morning, while under influenza.

		<shortDescription>Insultingly rubbish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bad movie is a bad movie but a bad remake is something else entirely. This film doesn't just do a bad job of retelling the original story it takes everything that was good about it and replaces it with a witless and disjointed story.Nicolas Cage is well cast as a man addicted to some kind of over the counter drugs. I was sick to death of his muttering and dopey face within about five minutes, you might find his routine wearing thin a little faster or slower depending on your tolerance. I think he might have done a little too much preparation for his role. Watching Nicolas Cage mumble his way through the script is quite painful at times, like seeing an elderly dog trying to chase a postman on arthritic legs and not understanding why he can't quite do it anymore.The original story was quite chilling but here it's all kind of a joke. There's something really repulsive about a director remaking a film when they clearly haven't taken the time to understand the original. The plot is weaker than you would believe without seeing it and the whole war of the sexes thing is just not interesting. The director of this film should be forcibly prevented from remaking any more films, this film is a big fat insult to a classic movie and a sign of how cynical and artless Hollywood has become. Sad times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>INVASION OF THE BEE GIRLS Was Scarier Than Neil LaBute's Misbegotten Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the 2006 remake of THE WICKER MAN (TWMv2) was released, the newspaper ads ballyhooed the "shocking ending." Well, the ending wasn't the least bit shocking to those of us who've seen and loved the original film; for us, what's shocking is the waste of celluloid and great acting talent in LaBute's ham-fisted, wrongheaded remake. I wouldn't mind the changes if they'd resulted in an intriguing story, but LaBute and company only succeed in replacing intelligent dialogue and suspenseful situations with laughable dialogue and plot "improvements" that the gang at MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 would have had a field day with.True to LaBute's usual story lines full of hysterical (in more ways than one) hostility to women, he turns the pagan society of Summersisle (the extra "s" in the middle is never explained. My husband quipped that obviously Lord Summerisle refused to give LaBute permission to use his name :-)) into a society of beekeepers on a Puget Sound island, with Summersisle's big export being honey instead of fruit. In this version, the islanders are all women, except for a few males who seem to exist only for the occasional bit of heavy lifting. Get this: when they want to create new little Summersislers -- and get themselves a new batch of potential sacrifices in case the bees fall down on the job -- they send the younger, prettier girls to the mainland to pick up guys and get themselves knocked up. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't have minded the concept of a society of women up to no good if it had been done with anything even remotely resembling intelligence, wit, or suspense, but the way it's done here, it's just plain dopey! Summersisle is described as a pagan society, but the only remotely pagan elements besides the sacrifice are the costumes worn during the climactic festival, and even those become ridiculous thanks to the bee motif. The playful yet unsettling pagan costumes from the original WICKER MAN become unintentionally hilarious when adapted to LaBute's beehive gimmick for TWMv2! If the sight of kiddies wearing bee costumes a la The Not Ready For Prime Time Players in Saturday NIGHT LIVE's first season doesn't make you double over laughing, the sight of Nicolas Cage overpowering the Amazonian Diane Delano (best known in our household as "Mountain Girl" in the Coen Brothers' hilarious 2004 remake of THE LADYKILLERS) so he can go undercover in her bear costume will. And don't get me started on the face-painting that's supposed to make the women look fierce during that "shocking ending," but instead makes them look like they wandered in from some sporting event.The stiff-necked but capable Sgt. Howie of the original is now American motorcycle cop Edward Malus (pronounced "may-liss," although all I felt was mal-us towards all concerned), played by Cage in the scenery-chomping mode he all too often resorts to in dramas. He's better in comedies, particularly intentional comedies like RAISING ARIZONA and HONEYMOON IN VEGAS, as opposed to unintentional comedies like, well, TWMv2! Anyway, Edward becomes a haunted, nervous wreck after failing to rescue a mother and daughter from a violent car crash that's never explained, not to mention poorly acted by the actresses playing the mother and child. Now it's Willow Woodward (OK, so at least LaBute tried to throw a bone to fans of the original by clumsily invoking Edward Woodward's name in two different characters) who summons the cop protagonist to the island to look for Rowan, who's now a tiny tyke instead of a 12-year-old. Willow is Edward's former flame (apparently they were really in love and Edward wasn't just another pickup), and Rowan turns out to be the daughter Edward didn't know he had. Willow's character has been changed from a saucy, wall-banging temptress to a frightened, one-note damsel-in-distress type, played by pretty Aussie actress Kate Beahan (doing a convincing American accent) as if she's about to burst into tears any minute.The rest of the cast, including, among others, Ellen Burstyn as Mistress Summersisle, Molly Parker as Miss Rose, and Frances Conroy as Dr. Moss, do the best they can to lend conviction to their ill-conceived characters. They've got their work cut out for them, though, with accidentally funny bits like Edward holding a gun on Miss Rose, screaming, "Step away from the bicycle!" and such lame plot points as Edward being allergic to bees. Don't get me wrong; as the mother of a child with a severe peanut allergy, I know all too well how terrifying and deadly an allergic reaction can be, but somehow it's hard to portray it in a scary way in a movie, especially when it's rendered as ineptly as it is here. It doesn't help that LaBute apparently figured all he had to do to shock the audience was to occasionally show women covered in live, squirming bees, a tactic which gets surprisingly old surprisingly fast. Ugh! Save the 2006 version for a DIY MST3K party with your friends, and watch the 1973 cult classic if you want to see an intelligent, thought-provoking suspense film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You sit through the intensely boring parts to laugh whole-heartedly at everything else. A real winner, in an ironic way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I hate to admit it, this film is one of those that are so good, because they are so bad. A common thing to say about a truly awful film is that you can laugh AT it, but never really mean it, this film however, had me roaring with laughter, and I didn't see it whilst drinking with a room full of friends either, I saw it alone in the middle of the night!Nicholas Cage stars as an unintentionally slow minded, drawling, trundling behemoth of a character who mumbles some things and yells everything else in no particular pattern. The acting in this film, staggers along without confidence or the vaguest amount of skill, it's a sad sight really.Anyway he plays a copper who pulls over a mother and young daughter to the side of the road, after he steps away from the car and looks back a huge truck comes and smashes into the front of it for no reason (I say no reason because, this truck must've been driving NEXT to the road AND going the wrong way) Cage immediately runs to the back of the car and begins smashing away at the rear window to save the completely unharmed and surprisingly apathetic looking young child. Needless to say the car is soon to explode and chooses to do so as Cage is halfway leaned right inside the car. The car goes BANG obliterating the mother and child and just gently shoves Cage out the back of the car leaving him without a scratch. Well we're told Cage has a hard time coming to terms with this and spends, i dunno, an hour or so off-work to grieve at home. At this point he receives a letter asking him to come to some secluded island to find the whereabouts of his ex-girlfriend's missing daughter. So he goes there, aaaaaand the place is full of strange culty weirdos (run entirely by women, the men are mindless zombies. Wouldn't want to appear misogynistic you see)The ferry-ride over contains one of the more funny parts of the film. He sees a little girl out on the deck from inside, and a truck FLIES out of the sky and runs her over! we're even treated to a crushing, splatting sound. Brilliant. Later on he's lying in bed and has a flash-back, but not of the little girl in the car who was killed, but of the same girl in the ferry being killed by his own daydream!The original Wicker Man is an incredible film (as are the two songs based on it) and remake really is an abomination. The music of the original is one of it's finest, most important points, to which the director of the remake (whose name I don't care to learn) says is 'poor' music, and the fans of which he doesn't WANT enjoying his remake. In other words, this remake is made by someone who didn't like, or even GET the original.They also got rid of the Christian themes (wouldn't want to appear anti-Christian) which was another of the driving forces behind the original The nudity in the original was also something that had a god point to it and made a good impact, which was something else the remake avoided (wouldn't want to appear too liberal) The sensible malice of Christopher Lee's Lord Summerisle has been replaced by some frail, dottering old woman, who cares? In short, ALL the originality, ALL the power, ALL the character, ALL the music, ALL the emotion, ALL messages and ALL the interest the original garnered has been replaced by...well, nothing really.Still, I advise you do rent this and do sit it through for the funny parts, favourites include:Nicholas Cage charging around in a bear suit yelling at people (Imagine if you just walk into the room when this scene starts)Nicholas Cage (the cop) beating up helpless women out of sheer anger and being hailed as a hero for it (so much for no appearing misogynistic)Nicholas Cage fighting his way through loads of bees ("they're in, my, EYES!")Nicholas Cage yelling "how did it get burned!? how did it get burned!? howdiditgetburned!?HOWDIDITGETBURNED!?!?"*********SPOILERS AHEAD***********Thought I'd best add this too, probably my favourite scene in any movie ever:Nicholas Cage being caught by the cultists and yelling "BITCHES!! YOU BITCHES!!" and "Killing me won't bring back you're GOD DAMN HONEY!!"Finishing with the SIDE-SPLITTINGLY hilarious sounds of him being beaten up, like the Will Ferrel skit from Austin Powers "I don't want to die! *CRACK* ...I don't believe in your gods!! *CRACK* ......AAaaaarrrggghhhh!! MY LEGS!!!"Hahaha! He actually yells "AArrrgghh!!! My legs!!"*********END SPOILERS*********Yeah so, I reeeaaally wouldn't bother with this if you're after something of high quality. Go and rent Apocalypse Now or something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New version about one of the most unusual British films and with unsettling acting from Nicolas Cage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake deals about a depressed patrolman(Nicolas Cage, role of Edward Woodward)affected by a car accident. He receives a letter from ex-girlfriend(Kate Beaham) asking help for her disappeared daughter. Then he goes to a lonely island, located in state of Washington. There lives a strange matriarchal community, an Amish-alike, whose denizens(Molly Parker,Leelee Sobiesky,Diane Delano, in former version were Diane Cilento,Britt Ekland,Christopher Lee,Lindsay Kemp among others) practice rare pagan rituals and pre-Celtics customs and ruled by a chief sister(Ellen Burstyn).This new version from British classic by Robin Hardy contains suspense, mystery, occult terror without gratuitous gore and spectacular outdoors shot in Vancouver. Very persuasively script written by Neal LaBute, differs on the original -by playwright Anthony Shaffer, author of 'Sleuth' -in various issues, previous adaptation is set in a Scottish offshore island with a community practicing bizarre pagan sexual rites, here is in State of Washington with a matriarchal society and without sexual situations. Besides first version the community cultivated apples, while this one are bees with drones represented by men and a Bee Queen well incarnated by Ellen Burstyn. The film displays a very good cinematography by Paul Sarossy and unsettling musical score by Angelo Badalamenti, author of Twin Peaks soundtrack. The motion picture is professionally directed by Neal LaBute, though with no originally. The movie is dedicated to Johnny Ramone memory, recently deceased. Furthermore there is a final alternative, only available in DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicholas Cage should be ashamed of himself for acting AND producing such as lousy movie. The ending made the entire movie pointless and irrelevant. The on;y redeeming feature was the scenery. From the one dimensional characters to the lame plot the "hero" is driven on the flimsiest "evidence" never questioning anyone longer than it takes to get out a cliché. This movie annoyed and aggrevated me, you saw the ending coming after 20 mins and still cannot believe they actually did it. Like spoof horror movie, the "hero" constantly takes action that you know will get him trapped or killed. Better writing and a more positive ending could have saved this movie but it did not happen. Avoid this movie and do not rent the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The remake of The Wicker Man is as bad as the original is good. The original is one of my favourite films, maybe my very favourite. So, no, I didn't go into the remake with a very open mind. But I simply didn't expect it to be as bad as it was. As a remake it was all wrong, with the themes and style of the original film completely destroyed.However, more than that, just taken by itself as a modern horror/thriller movie it's awful. It doesn't make sense. Characters come and go with no reason or explanation. Nicolas Cage spends the entire movie looking as if he's trying to work out whether or not he's just soiled himself. Events just... happen, seemingly at random. Scenes just... occur. It's a complete mess. Something went horribly, horribly wrong here.It's genuinely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's up there with Romance, Boxing Helena and Batman &amp; Robin.And it's probably put people off seeing the original, which is just completely criminal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Very Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I imagine that watching this movie is like getting a vodka enema: Largely pointless and quite painful.Quite honestly it is hard to put into words just how bad this movie is. Nicholas Cage is just about as wooden as it gets. Like Tom Cruise in War of the Worlds, his character is so tedious one can't help but be ambivalent as to their fate.The movie trundles from one tedious scene to another in a story that makes very little sense and does nothing to capture the imagination. I was watching the movie at a friends house and it was honestly so bad I changed my mind about being the designated driver just so I could drink more. I had hoped that drinking more wine would make the movie more palatable. Sadly, it did not. Although it did make the movie pass slightly quicker which is a blessing. It's bad enough wasting two hours of your life, but it's far worse when those two hours seem like ten.By the time I had started on my second bottle of red wine I began to laugh at some of the ridiculous scenes towards the end of the movie. But I can't help but think that the wine made the scenes more amusing than they really are. In reality the amusement came from caustic remarks from the others who were being subjected to this drivel as opposed to anything specific in the movie.If you are planing to watch this movie, I suggest you do so at a friends house. That way you don't have to pay for it. I also strongly suggest a serious amount of alcohol to numb the pain.This movie is a raspberry shaped turkey that actually makes Face Off and Battlefield Earth seem like half decent movies. Unless you are really in the mood for a terrible movie and have a sincere desire to squander two hours of your life, give this one a miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Step away from the bike. Mmm.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen anyone run around aimlessly in a film quite as much as Nicholas Cage does in the Wicker Man. Most of the film seemed to consist of him sprinting from one location to another, either shouting at women or knocking them unconscious. At least he got a rest at the end of the movie when they carried him off to the Wicker Man.There are a lot of irrelevant parts to the film, the bees and even the car crash at the beginning seemed to have no real significance to anything that actually happened in the film. Also the fact the men were so subservient they couldn't utter a word was unbelievable.In the 1973 original Edward Woodward's character investigated in such a way that it gave some understanding as to why a sacrifice was being made and explored a conflict of beliefs between the pagans and the Christian policeman. The remake does not touch on this subject or give any real reason for his sacrifice other than the fact they were trying to "get one over on him".The "step away from the bike" line though, is a classic and there are quite a few similar unintentionally funny moments in the film.The scenery was probably the best part of the film but overall the movie lacked cohesion and credibility and could only be recommended for the "unintentional comedy moments" and to see how bad it really is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not the best movie Cage has ever made. The story starts off with quite a heavy and brutal car accident and that is about the only interesting scene in the whole movie. It's Cage that has to do all of the acting. The other actors don't seem to care much about it. Also there is a constant flashback throughout the movie of the car accident in the first sense of the film but at the end of the flick I couldn't quite see the connection to the other events that go on.I also find it totally unbelievable that Cage starts the investigation on the island all by himself. He isn't even a detective so he has no jurisdiction to be wandering around, questioning people and sneaking around in their houses.Even though the ending is quite surprising and might shock the viewer a bit, it still doesn't make up for the 90 minutes of rubbish that already struck you.Summary: The trailers and posters of the "The wicker man" are just like an image of a MC Donalds Big Mac on a billboard.

		<fullReview>Firstly, I would like to say I have never been so moved by the complete stupidity of movie to actually submit a comment online.This script was terrible. Why would so many fairly respectable actors take part in a disaster with such a preposterous plot line? Not withstanding the fact that it was obvious half way through the film he was the intended victim. Why, why, why would these people go through such an elaborate ruse to claim their victim when they merely could have bonked him over the head or something the second he stepped onto their farcical little island. At least the movie would have only been 15 minutes long that way and I wouldn't have felt I had wasted two hours of my life on this P.O.S.I can't even describe the silly dialogue. The entire audience was laughing at lines that were intended to heighten the suspense. Speaking of which, not much in the way of suspense to divvy about either.I was so fed up with Nicolas Cage's character (how stupid is this guy? You're being set-up.... duh? Isn't he supposed to be a cop?) that I was actually glad to see him go up in flames.How ridiculous was that bear suit scene, huh? I thought the movie had suddenly turned into comedy. That seen would have played wonderfully for the Wayans brothers.P.S. who's the woman hater anyway? This Neil LaBute guy must really have had some bad experiences to portray women in such a way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumb Remake Of A Dumb Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely hated the original version of THE WICKER MAN down to the absolute ridiculous plot holes but to give Neil LaBute credit he does at least try to bring credibility to this remake by setting up the story via a policeman receiving a letter from a woman he knew at the community he grew up in many years ago . Compare this to the completely idiotic way the story is set up in the original and some respect to also trying to rid the original screenplay of its other plot holes like confining the number of crop failures to a mere one in this version I'm afraid that there will be no more praise for LaBute in this short review because managing to salvage something out of a remake of a very poor film is like trying to find something bad to say about Adolph Hitler because this is still a very tedious , poor thriller . It's maybe not as bad as many people have said but that's hardly strong praise from me is it ? Nicholas Cage seems to have appeared in many films spliffed out of his mind and this is the worst performance of his idiosyncratic style . No offence but if you're casting a film is it not essential that your leading man is fully conscious in a starring role ? Honestly Cage gives a whole new meaning to sleepwalking . Having said that the painfully overlong shot length hasn't helped proceedings and I could hardly stay awake watching this because everything is written and shot at a snail's pace and while LaBute has written out many plot holes he has clumsily introduced some of his own like a mobile phone failing to work when the story demands it . Wouldn't it have been better to have set the story in a region where mobile's don't work due to their remote location instead of the hero suddenly getting a phone call on his mobile ? No doubt many of the more critical reviewers will scream " IGNORE THIS RUBBISH AND WATCH THE ORIGINAL " My advice to the neutral observer would be ignore both versions and do something more interesting like watching paint dry or grass grow instead</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Teeters between boring and hilariously awful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any movie-goer who has ever watched a movie critic at any point has probably heard of this movie. Wicker Man joins the ranks of films such as The Room, Troll 2, and Battlefield Earth as a hilarious accident that is lightning in a bottle. First of all, I don't know why this remake exists. The original is a cult classic that had some genuinely great moments. I guess that made it a prime target for Hollywood, so here it is. All of the dialog in this movie, and I mean EVERY. SINGLE. LINE. is hilariously bad or just awkward, or sometimes both. The acting is just awful. Nick Cage turns the scenery chewing up to eleven, and everyone else is either not talented enough or trying too hard to act. Really the strongest parts of this movie are act one and act three. Most of the classic terrible lines (NOT THE BEES! HOW'D IT GET BURNED? What's in the bag, a shark or something?) are in those acts, and enough is happening to keep you entertained. However, the second act where the actual investigating is occurring is just boring. It is incredibly repetitive and turns into just a generic boring investigation flick. I realize that there isn't a film out there that is hilariously terrible for the entire running time, but this one tries. If you can find it for a dollar, and want to see Hollywood gone oh so wrong, give this a try. If you like bad movies, you've seen this already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth seeing but for all the wrong reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I forgot the fact that I didn't do a review on this movie. If I hadn't seen the original a couple of days ago, it would have probably stayed that way. This movie is... weird. But unlike the original, which the weirdness in that adds to the film's strange qualities about it, this one does weirdness in such a way that makes it enjoyable to watch, just not in the way the director intended.So the plot, a cop troubled with the death of a mother and child via truck that he was partly responsible for, he is sent a letter by an ex-girlfriend that reports her missing child on the island she lives (kind of outside his jurisdiction, really) that may or may not be his. So when he gets there he finds that it's run by some kind of neo-pagan cult that's entirely made up of women and men are a minority to do work or some crap.This movie is awful. Nicholas Cage spends most of the movie just fumbling around barely doing anything. When asking someone if he's seen the lost child and they don't answer - he just changes the subject and we're supposed to believe his intentions are sincere after that. The reason why the original does this better is that the remake pads out him not having any luck in finding the child to questioning whether he cares.Although... This movie gets hilarious. Do I even need to tell you about the "Not the bees!" scene, the "How did it get burned?!" or even Nicholas Cage in a bear suit punching people. And this was meant to be serious? Well, there are scenes like this that, thanks to Nicholas Cage mainly - just become funny.Aside from that there isn't anything else to comment on. I'd say don't see it if you're a fan of the original or anything like that, see it if you're a Nicholas Cage fan. This movie showcases his all-out craziness like no other movie I've seen him do. There is just so much reasoning to see it if you're a Nick Cage fan that it's well worth the watch. Everyone else... You won't enjoy this.</fullReview>

This one earned its four points out of guilty pleasure: it is truly bad, truly bad, to a degree that very few films manage to reach and thus becomes almost great in its badness. There are many youtube videos documenting the badness of the movie showing the various (non- intentionally) hilarious scenes. These scenes which endows the film with a certain quality that is lacking in other bad movies. The fact that it has one of the greatest actors ever (Nicolas Cage) add to the quality of the movie in making the horrible lines of dialogue being delivered with absolute conviction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The '73 classic - A cultural and religious clash and a witty social commentary, skillfully blended into a cozy thriller mystery. Fun, bold, stylish, beautifully directed, scored and featuring a mind-blowing ending.The '06 remake - I'd rather watch Jason Takes Over Manhattan, thank you. Nothing to see here, it's basically an inferior product. Even as a stand-alone movie, the plot is trite and badly laid-out, the acting wooden, the scares... well, there are none.The horror fails even more glamorously than in the original, that was labeled as a horror just to boost the sales, when it was, in fact, a classic murder mystery. The remake is far from the worst movie ever (an honor reserved for Plan 9 and its ilk) but there is nothing to praise from the technical aspect. Everything from direction to screenplay is bland, boring, uninspired and unfulfilling.I'm still kinda puzzled as to why it needed a remake in the first place. Was there something missing? If I remember correctly, the original was one of the most polished movies I've ever seen. This was just unnecessary.</fullReview>

Worse than that, it is actually consistent within itself and doesn't rely on shaking first person camera shots. Unacceptable! But seriously, 3.5 out of 10? This movie is a 6.x to 7.x movie. Nicholas Cage was well cast and did a great job. The no-name actors are very convincing, and were a lot stronger than many female leads in other movies.This leaves just one complaint vector -- the remake is not as good as the original (or doesn't slavishly follow the book). Who cares? Why is that an issue? Thomas Crown two is very different from TC1 -- and both are great movies.Book readers, get over yourself. By your "logic", The Shawshank Redemption is unfit for human consumption. Create iBOOKdb.com and be done with it.This movie is for people who don't want to watch blood and guts horror movies. Those who prefer The Green Mile to Carrie. And it works just fine, thank you very much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's so sad that the plot was so outrageously retarded, because the value of production and cinematography and sound and budget was so high. Wicker Man is shot so well but virtually impossible to sit through because of the mindless plot and dialogue. But it is hilarious in the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 sort of way. So to explain my 4 stars it was for the cinematography and sound cause they are both great. The digital effects are good but really out of place. Everything else is terrible. The magic of movie making was lost 25 minutes into the film and in the beginning of the "third act" LaBute (the director, really?) just gives up trying to keep the viewer scared or emotionally invested at all. BUT IT IS SO DAMN FUNNY SOMETIMES. i don't want to give anything away but it is one of the funniest (clearly unintentional) movies i've seen in a while. Especially when Nick Cage just starts randomly throwing knockout haymakers at every woman he sees. O and he's in a bear suit for that part, for no apparent reason. Overall... pretty bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First this movie was not that bad.It was entertaining...at least to me for probably all the wrong reasons. I have never seen the original so can't compare the two.This movie reminded me of that weird Christopher Reeve movie Village of the Damned. THe two movies have different plots, but that creepy disgusted feeling and unwanted comedy exist in both.The wicker man is suppose to be a mystery/thriller/men please don't anger the women movie. I don't know the whole pagan thing and sacrifice was a little off.Nicholas Cage, his glorious bad self goes to a secluded Island called Summerisle when he receives a letter in calligraphy from his long lost fiancée who claims her daughter has been taken and hidden by fellow islanders. Cage is a police officer and being the weary policeman he is he goes to the semi uncharted island leaving no word of his whereabouts to anyone who is located in the real world. Stupid.Things get weirder when the large Amish-esquire women who populate the island snarl at him and lie about the whereabouts of the missing girl. His fiancée is no help who seems to be elusive and weary the whole time. Cage stays on the Island when he learns that the missing girl is his daughter and he is the lucky man tricked to come to this island as a sacrificial victim during the islands sick harvest festival.In this movie males do not fare so well. A sick twisted display of feminism? I found the movie laughable at times particularly when cage punches some women and runs around in a bear suit. I think there were too many potholes in this movie. I find the whole concept of angry women secluding themselves on an island without any care for males quite entertaining, but the way it was portrayed in this movie was just weird. While most women have had some jerk hurt and anger them this is clearly a form of sexism. I would have turned the movie off in disgust if the roles were reversed. This movie is something to watch maybe just once or twice. It is NOT a thriller it should be categorized as just strange.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is suppose to be a mysterious, serious thriller about a man looking for a missing girl. However, 30 minutes into the movie, it turns into a funny, unrealistic story with annoying characters and random scenes. I can't imagine anyone not laughing when Cage randomly Karate kicks that blonde girl or when he "bear" punches that old lady. The lines, characters, and acting are all poorly done from the get-go. I've always liked Nicolas Cage as an actor, but he has made some terrible movies this year; this being by far the worst one (yet...).I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch an intense story-gripping thriller. If you really want to enjoy this story, go rent the original. However, if you intend on watching it, get ready to laugh at some of the lines and end scenes rather than taking them seriously; that's the only way you enjoy this film.</fullReview>

He is traumatized over this and is seen popping pills. A mysterious letter turns up from an old girlfriend asking for help in finding her missing daughter. So Ed travels to an island commune of mainly woman. They don't like outsiders. A lot of filler is with Ed shown looking around town for the girl. That made the movie too long. It finally gets a little better toward the end when we learn of the crazy rituals the woman perform and finally of the sinister plan in store for Edward.Overall, not a well written story and too long.

He's the fellow that no matter how stupid, lame, and incomprehensibly dull a film is, he says "Gee, I don't know why everyone hated it, I found it intriguing." He's the kind of guy who finds the scent of dog poop intriguing. Especially when he smears it in the shape of a Hitler mustache on his upper lip and marches about the house ranting about the brilliance of science fiction that features thinly veiled references to Greek mythology.

		<fullReview>The original Wicker Man is a true masterpiece, a cult classic and maybe the best film ever made in Britain. The reason its a good film is because it has a good script, good acting and a daringly original plot. The remake, unfortunately, lacks all of these things strongly. The only similarities with the original is the name of the island. Thats it. Even if it wasn't dubbed as a remake it would still be a horrible individual film. All the rest of the film is, is juts feeding us the same old crap we've been watching from Hollywood over the past five years. Its filled with cheap special effects, and jump scenes to make sure the audience stays awake. The acting is cringe worthy, and half the time the local townspeople look embarrassed to be in such a bad film, and I have to say I don't blame them.A few of my favorite quotes which show how truly awful this movie is would include: Edward Malus: (a "crack" sound) "Ahhh, my legs!" Edward Malus: (Pointing gun at Rose) "Step away from the bike! " Edward Malus: "Oh no, not the bees! Not the bees! Ahhhhhh! All over my eyes! Eyes! Blaaaarghhh!

It was really the Christian public expressing their fear of paganism. If you dig deeper into it it also makes comments on life but I don't want to go into details, just, simply put, if you were disappointed and you'd like to know what it SHOULD look like, feel free to watch the 70s version, a little dated, but A lot better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>America's retake on old Scottish pagan tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christopher Lee once called 'The Wickerman' the best film he had ever done. It was said that when he heard there was a remake on the cards, he could not see the point of it. Quite a few of the audience who have seen it probably agreed with him.Alas, Lee's wonderful Lord Summerisle is not present in this rather inferior effort. He has been replaced by Sister Summersisle (note the new spelling) in a tale about American cop in remote island community tragedy. Taking Edward Woodward's place is Nicholas Cage, an actor who has made some brilliant films in the last few years but seems to have some trouble with this. Cage swops Woodward's Christian puritan cop for a tortured American 'IAAAAM here to investigate a disappearance of ahhh missing girl' type cop. This is a man who tries desperately to drown out the effects of a botched rescue attempt with pills and finds himself carrying out a missing person cause on a remote island community.But this is no ordinary island community. This is one where the women have literally taken over the island, the men having been relegated to heavy lifting type jobs and quietly talking among themselves. And the women have found a new religion to occupy their energies: that of mother earth paganism. Headed by their high priestess, the women re-enact old pagan rituals to try and improve their harvest.The film, however, is very flawed. Little of the charm of the original remains, such as the fine folk music and mischief of the villagers as they delight in taunting Howie in the original. This film is also very mixed up with the Wickerman in the film merely without meaning as if the director had to put a wickerman in the film because that was what the title was about. There is also a subplot about bees and how the whole community is somehow like that of a colony or hive. Even Burstyn's 'Kill the Drone' chant at the end, replacing Lee's folk song marks out this film as different from the older movie as it is possible to be.There is far too much violence as well. Quite why Labute had to have Cage punching and kicking three women in a film is beyond me but nothing good comes of it.In my view, a nice, if somewhat pointless try.</fullReview>

Sister Rose: "Rose, sister rose." (who does she think she is, miss bond)Edward: "Get off the bike! Get off the bike! (gets out gun) Step away from the bike."Simply the idea of having a California officer riding a bike just does not feel right, even if it is an isolated island, it just didn't feel right.His tough guy and waving guns around and swearing act just didn't work in this place and the film is no patch on the original. The end scenes were fine except for Nick cage not making us feel as sorry for his character as Edward Woodward did with his cries and prayers as he burns and we needed no leg breaking for us to feel that. Just acting. And why was there an added on bit which paves the way for a sequel. Please no. this was insult enough. This was a terrible remake and should never have been touched. The original had a feeling at the time that doesn't come across well in 2006 in America.I missed all the focus on the Pagan religion, the may day festival dance and the fertility song and felt that the replacement of most of this with the other storyline about bees weakened what could have a been great remake if they stuck to the original material. As they didn't it lost what made it such a scary film back in the 70's and 80's I may be biased as a British person but I really believe they could have done better.i really like Ellen Burstyn and she is a great actress and she does a good job but i also think it was a bad move to change the character of Lord Summerisle into a woman. some films really do not need a remake and this was one.I'm sorry but I really did not enjoy this remake and there are only a few that I have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glad I only lost $3 on a video rental. Lousy film, otherwise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film reminds me of a specific scene from the James Bond film, "Goldfinger." The scene involves a meeting called by Goldfinger where he invites a number of people who, in theory, will invest money to back his criminal takeover of Fort Knox. In one sub-scene, one of the potential investors at the meeting decides not to be involved. And while Goldfinger appears to be letting him go his own way, he's actually instructed his henchman, Odd Job, to kill him and dispose of his body in a nasty way.For the rest of the meeting attendees, he gives an elaborate presentation to persuade them to invest. And after the presentation, guess what he does? Yup, he kills them, too ... making the theatrics of his presentation absolutely meaningless. In short, he could have just lured them all into the meeting room, left the room, and gassed them to death as he ultimately did WITHOUT the presentation.-----*****-----S P O I L E R____A L E R T-----*****----- Nicolas Cage's fate was sealed the moment he set foot on the island. And the lies and half-truths he encountered while searching for the little girl were an elaborate "presentation" that had no meaning. In short, the island residents could have just tied him up (or drugged him) and proceeded with their plans WITHOUT the elaborate presentation.So many things about this film bothered me. Presentation without purpose was the biggie. But, the dialogue between Cage and his former fiancée was plodding and, when I rented the DVD, started to make me nod off during the first viewing. And on the DVD end of things, three problems.First, look at the DVD cover. It implies that a little girl with evil eyes has a central role in the film. Far from it. You don't even see her until near the end of the film - and she has the sweetest face and eyes (and no dialogue). And the only evil thing she does is start a bonfire with a torch, no magic required. Hoop-de-doo.Secondly, the DVD has an "unrated" version on one side and the theatrical version on the other. Usually, when unrated versions are released, it implies more carnal nastiness than the ordinary version. Not even close. Both versions are identical with 3 exceptions:1) The unrated version shows Cage having his legs broken at the kneecaps using a trick stolen from the Stephen King film, "Misery." In "Misery," however, the ankles were broken, not the kneecaps. But certainly, this is nothing to be "unrated" about.2) The unrated version shows Cage having a cage-mask put on his head - with angry bees poured into the mask. No blood or gore, though, and I saw more frightening scenes in the film, "Poltergeist." Again, this scene is nothing to be "unrated" about.3) The unrated version deletes the last scene showing two of the island "sisters" going to the mainland to find new "recruits" for their sacrifice ritual ... and "removing" an implied sexual situation from a film makes it less likely to be considered "unrated."Finally, remember that Cage didn't know the girl was HIS daughter when his former fiancée contacted him by letter. Privately owned or not, that island was in the territory of Washington state - and Cage was a California cop. Had I been Cage's character, I would have gone to the island, too -- but only as an observer. My first stop would be the offices of the Washington State Patrol. And being a missing child, I'd have insisted on being accompanied by legally empowered state investigators to investigate this "properly" as a missing-persons report should be ... as well as a volunteer search and rescue team that is usually dispatched in Washington state when a child goes missing in a remote area (I used to live in Washington and that's what they do). When looking for a missing child in a remote area, 100 pairs of eyes are better than one ... and as a cop, Cage should have known and appreciated that.The only reason I gave this film 2 stars (one star above "awful") is because it's one of the few films that at least attempts to present a matriarchal society ... a society where women rule. If you take away the ritualistic witchcraft in this film, a society like theirs actually exists in a remote corner of China - where women practice what they call a "walking marriage" - using men only for personal pleasure and procreation purposes while excluding them from any power or control within their society. If you're curious about this culture, visit this URL:http://tinyurl.com/v3jgvYou might even consider renting Michael Palin's "Himalaya" DVD set to see these people up close. For sure, it would be time and money better spent than if you'd spent them watching "Wicker Man."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shape of the Wicker Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit, I had high hopes for this film. I'm a huge fan of the original and I thought it would be an interesting remake. These days people are more aware of their spirituality and alternative religious beliefs than they were in 1973 when the original came out. Secondly I was excited about Neil Labute directing given that I just saw The Shape of Things and loved it. I wasn't excited but not thrilled about the cast. The first 15 minutes were horrid, everything from the Everything's OK tapes (why did they take them anyways?)to Officer Ed picking up the doll on his speeding bike (I turned to my buddy and we both let out a unanimous 'you got to be *beep* me'). I liked that the film wasn't a scene for scene remake like Psycho, or The Omen. I did like some of the changes that were made, Cage's character having a relationship with Willow, in the original Willow is the landlord's daughter and temptress of the town and has no connection to Sgt. Howie other than her attempt to seduce him. In the original the society is pagan, replaced with a feminist society, female empowerment. Which I thought okay, I see where there going with this. The way I understand the Pentagram in the Pagan beliefs(not the pentacle) is it's shape and points of the stars refer to elements, fire ,water, earth, etc. but also has a strong connotation femininity and strength. I'm not an expert but this is what I've gathered from research and readings. Unfortuanately, a really interesting concept wasn't even explored in the film, the connections were there but poorly explained and vague. Also the bees? Cage's character is allergic and the island happens to be rich in bee hives for it's their main crop and I'm guessing it had something to do with female empowerment, queen bee things like that but once again, really fricking vague! It seems like Niel Labute really hates women and the whole movie is trying to point out how women are manipulating and evil creatures, men are just their minions. It's why I dubbed this film 'The Shape of the Wicker Man', see The Shape of Things and you'll know what I mean. The thing that I hated most about the film was how the entire film is changed and modernized and what not but the ending is still the same as the original! The ending is not at all consistent with the rest of the film! So instead of being shocking, eerie and effective like the classic 73 film, it's just preposterous and riddiculus, not to mention the 6 month later scenario, just absurd. The thing that made the movie as bad as it was is how unintentionaly funny it was, I was laughing so hard which is unfortuanate because the film is supposed to be a drama. Nick Cage wearing a bear suit and decking an old lady has to be the funniest thing I've ever seen, not to mention the line 'Killing me won't bring back your God Damn honey!' I think the whole audience was holding it's side from lauging so hard. I guess I'm glad I saw it just to cure my curiosity but it's an insult to the original film and one of the worst films I saw this summer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a horror film, it fails completely, and I mean completely. However, as a piece of comedy, this film is a real joy. For instance, there is a dream-within-a-dream sequence that missed the mark so spectacularly that I burst out laughing in utter shock. Funnier than that however is Nicolas Cage, whose lines 'How'd it get burned?!', 'What's in the bag, a shark or something?' and 'Oh no! Not the bees! Aghhhh!' deserve to be in the AFI Top 100 Quotes thanks mainly to Cage's, shall we say, 'Cageseque' delivery. The terrific script is laced with unintentionally funny lines, another notable moment being when Cage turns the acquiring of a bicycle into a serious police procedure - *draws gun* "Step away from the bike." Merely quoting these lines here does not do them justice, you have to see it to appreciate it. As you may know, the film's direction was so markedly ill-judged that the aforementioned scenes have now become legendary in the online community. Cage's battles with the maddeningly brainwashed women of Summersisle are also a joy to watch, as there are no holds barred when things get physical. Cage lays down the law with a combination of thundering punches to the face, kicks to the chest and stern Cagesque shouting, and there are times where he does all of this whilst dressed as a grizzly bear. I suspect my enjoyment was significantly compounded by the HD copy that I watched, so I would recommend that, as the filming locations are quite pretty. Overall I think this film is firmly within the 'so bad it's good' category, it's impossible to take it seriously - it really is entertainingly poor.www.hawkensian.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2006's Worst Remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man was i truly uninspired by this remake. I mean seriously, I thought to myself, with Nicholas Cage and maybe a faithful adaptation of the original it shouldn't be that bad. I mean how bad could it really be since I loved the original so much???? Well, everything the original had fails when this unfaithful 2006 film of the 1973 classic came to the silver screen. I mean this was just complete bull. What makes it so low.... Well sit back to read another horror review.- The whole concept of the Sergeant now being a detective and having an ex-girlfriend who is a resident on the island is ruined. Even the fact that the little girl is his daughter didn't do anything. It made matters worse. They ruined it totally.- There were many pointless, silly and PG like scenes which I have no idea why they tossed in there.- The acting is cheap and bland. Really didn't work for me at all. Nicolas Cage however is an exception though because I think he tried to make his character realistic, working with the stuff the director gave him.- You could already tell that the residents were awful and mean-spirited and not very nice. Instead here they are played out as evil beings who have no remorse. Lame!- The music is the only other exception. Not creepy but just OK-aish. It's better when the wicker man doesn't have music, because it creates more tension and builds on the key moments and suspense plots. However that didn't even save the films next major downfalls.- The mystery and fear is totally lost in this film and the director misses the concept of the story, scenes, suspense, mystery, plot and the point of the whole film. He also loses many key scene which made the original spectacular to watch.- Violence in the wicker man!? That's got to be a joke. It's unnecessary. In the original there is none except for the end. In this film, it's really cheesy. Comical punching, a torture scene bah!? Annoys me!This film is a waste of time and anyone who watches this will soon get bored easily and not really care for the characters or the film itself. And also what the heck was that scene from the start, where the mother and kid get killed and then he has continuous flash backs!? Silly! I won't be watching this film ever again. I should have listened to IMDb this time, but I had a strong feeling this film would be excellent.It's a 3/10 for me. Avoid at all COSTS!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>poor remake/update of a classic that required neither re-making or up-dating. very disappointing, as i loved the original and was genuinely expecting a film that would at least show some reverence for the material.NOPE! just your typical American trashy nonsense. to be fair, it did hold my attention, and there are some nice visuals, but that really doesn't justify its existence. Cage's performance is unremarkable... but that's no surprise. his continuing success in Hollywood is baffling - he steadfastly refuses to elicit anything other than ridicule from everyone i know. standard exchange with my amigos concerning cage's output runs thusly:"new film out, looks alright" - "yeah, who's in it?" - "ha... nicolas cage" - "cage..." (chuckle and rueful head shaking ensues all round)OVERALL, COMPLETELY UNECCESSARY AND TOTALLY BANAL!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The other night, I was trying to think of the worst movie I've seen in my life. No easy task, to be sure, as I like to think that every movie made has some redeeming quality. Even if a movie has horrible acting, that's not the writer's fault. That would be the fault of those casting the film, or the director. If there are plot holes, that could be the writer's fault, or it could the person doing the editing. However, when the movie makes no sense, has terrible acting, and leaves you feeling angry after watching it, then the question becomes - whose fault is it? Maybe everyone involved in the project royally screwed up. Or maybe it's my fault for watching it.It was funny to see that the main review spoke of people being "angry" after watching this movie. I'm not sure what it was, but I have never been so infuriated after watching a film. My girlfriend (who slept through it) was surprised by my visceral reaction - but it appears that I was not alone!This movie is absolutely terrible. It is made even more so by the fact that it has no reason to be, in that it cannot blame a lack of a budget on such things as bad costumes or acting."The Wicker Man" very well might be the winner of the "Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen" contest. Bravo, Nick Cage, bravo. Bravi, bravi, bravissimi!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will make this short, as most reviewers have summed this bag of sh1te up already! Have to say, if I was reviewing a comedy, it would've done pretty well! Both the script and the acting is appalling, nothing short of insulting to the original. And where do I start? Too many questions.. 1 - how come when Cage gets to meet the Sister Summersisle, he has been in the water, rolled down hills and run away from bees, yet his suit looks perfectly pressed?2 - How come he offered to help the mute man put a couple of logs back on his cart, yet when the rest fell off, Cage walked away cos the man happened to be mute?3 - Why did he have a major allergic reaction to the bees, and nearly died, yet when talking to the Sister, as the bees were flying into him, it didn't have any reaction?4 - why did the pregnant women he encountered walking in the wood, look like they had hidden jumpers up their dresses?5 - why does he show no sign of hypothermia or weakness after getting out of a full of water well he has just spent hours?6 - why does he shout continuously lines like "how did it get burned?" repeatedly6 - Why is he so thick and exceedingly stupid?Far too many more to list. And in all honesty, at least for those who love the original, we had some empathy for Edward Woodward's character - but actually i couldn't care less what happened to Nic's character because he was so awful and unlikeable, with a real arrogant attitude and a clear hatred of womenTerrible - 1 out of 10 for sticking to the original font on the title, nothing else</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A man gets tricked into going to an island controlled by women who had a bad bee honey harvest and set him up to be a human sacrifice, and they burn him to death in the end to insure a good harvest in the following year. Duh! I gave this movie two stars because Nicholas Cage did his usual good acting. The idea was sort of OK, but I figured out it was a set up about half way through the film.I kept thinking "What would Jack do!". That's how I rate these kinds of movies nowadays. Jack would have kicked one of those bitches in a chair, tied her up and made her squeal like a pig in the first five minutes. End of the game right there.But the thing that really makes this movie ludicrous it that the director expects the audience to believe that a pilot who delivers goods to the island everyday can be killed, have his airplane sunk (with the tip of the wing still sticking out of the water) and no one on the mainland is going to miss him. Duh! Like an airplane and pilot disappear and nobody is going to try to find out what happened to the pilot or the plane when the pilot must buy supplies, get gas, have relatives and do about a hundred other everyday things that suddenly stop happening. Gee, we must be in Russia or North Korea or maybe on another planet if you think that is going to happen. Even a little airplane like that has to file a flight plan.So, eventually when the investigation really begins (after someone finally says "Hmm, ole Jeb's been missing 10 years now,should we send out a search party" how are the Amazons going to explain a dead pilot, sunk airplane, and the fact that the airplane's radio has been shredded? Aliens? Also, After Nicholas Cage finds the airplane with the radio ripped out, he does nothing. Duh! I guess he figured that was normal since he didn't even mention it to anyone.You would think that after finding the plane with no pilot (before it was sunk) and the radio ripped out he would have given some kind of indication that there was something extremely bad happening there besides a bunch of wackos running around acting like they're in a Greek tragedy. (I guess we are just supposed to suspend our ability to think at this point). But no, he just saunters around the island like that was an everyday occurrence. Maybe he thought the pilot was having a tall cool one up at the "inn". Nicholas Cage later finds the pilot dead near the beach and still takes no action against anyone. I don't mind ludicrous movies as long as they are believable and people who are intelligent act with intelligence which it seems like a lot of the directors nowadays don't have. But to suddenly have Nicholas Cage act like a dummy is going to far. It's disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wicker Man: Demoralisingly Hideous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The horror genre, at least in modern times, seems primarily hinged upon a number of fundamental tendencies. Of these, perhaps the most prevalent is the remake mentality, spawning an apparently incessant flow of reboots and rehashes of the successful horrors of times gone by. Many will argue for the justification of such remakes on the basis that the original films are now little known to the public en masse, a criterion arguably well-applied to The Wicker Man, its combined statuses as Scottish, cult, and from the 1970s making it ripe for a modern updating.Summoned by his ex-fiancé to the remote Washington island of Summersisle in order to search for her missing daughter, Edward Malus finds the task complicated by the unhelpful villagers, their unusual beliefs in a feministic paganism angling them against his intrusive inquisitions.An argument frequently put forward against the remake culture which dominates contemporary mainstream horror is that it is only films which originally failed that should be remade, their flaws addressed and remedied through new ideas and technologies. The term classic is employed for a reason, the films therewith identified revered precisely for their few problems, leaving little to improve upon. This is certainly the side of the argument which grows ever more convincing when watching the 2006 take on The Wicker Man. Where in 1973 we were met with the ardent fervour of Edward Woodward, here we are given instead the errant histrionics of Nicolas Cage, a man now almost unanimously accepted to be poisonous to the good name of cinema. Apparently unsure of which of his two stock personalities to call upon?those being his dull, near-comatose "dramatic" and his absurd over-the-top action persona?Cage flitters blindingly between both, producing a performance that is staggering in its lunacy. Whether commandeering a bicycle at gunpoint or punching a woman in the face whilst masquerading as a bear, every moment we are subjected to his untamed hysteria is wince- inducingly awful. It should come as no surprise, considering the above described events in the film's narrative, that the script is little better than the efforts of those hired to interpret it. In its original form, The Wicker Man was a wonderfully strange and hypnotic exploration of the despotism and oppressiveness of religiously-oriented society expressed primarily through the interactions of the Christian policeman and the pagan lord. Interestingly, much of these characters' dialogue is preserved for the remake, though in the mouths of Cage and Ellen Burstyn ?Christopher Lee's counterpart, bizarrely?it has none of the wit or dramatic resonance. What is uninteresting, and the final disheartening straw, is that the description "Christian policeman" no longer applies, Malus' religion never discussed whatsoever, leaving the clash of cultures and ideologies absent entirely, and thereby adding theme, purpose, and any kind of meaning to the list of items in which this film lacks. Without subtext, and with a notably fatuous and feeble plot, what remains in this story? Here's a hint: it starts with "no", and ends with "thing".Lacking in even the cheap scares many of its fellow horror remakes offer, The Wicker Man is simply dreadful in every way imaginable. A film this demoralisingly hideous is one thing, but to be so in attempting to recreate the magisterial splendour of a true genre great is a cinematic atrocity. If ever there was proof of the foolishness of remaking classics, this is it: definitive evidence that there is no facet as great as originality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An abomination of a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jesus suffering flashbacks, this is so mind-crushingly appalling I very nearly hurt myself. I was watching this travesty whilst eating a plate of pasta, and had to fight the almost overpowering urge to jab the fork I was using into the delicate tissues of my eyeballs, to spare me the trauma of the movie. Well, against the odds I managed to resist, if only to allow me to write this review as a warning to others.Under no circumstances watch this movie. Ever.No matter the temptation, no matter the curiosity aroused by the majesty of the source material, no matter that cynic in your head assuring you that, despite what everyone else says, it can't be that bad. It is that bad, and so much more besides.The most incredible part is that the bare bones of the story remain in tact, as Nicholas Cage (I'll get on to him shortly) goes to a remote island known as Summerslsle (sic) to investigate the apparent disappearance of one of the island's children, Rowan. What he discovers upon arrival is an isolated community practicing Pagan rituals, and locals who are none too cooperative with his investigation.Some scenes even survive all but intact: the arrival by water plane, the announcement in the pub, the unusual teachings in class, but there any similarities cease.Nicholas Cage is reputed to have recommended this remake, so affected was he by the original so it is astounding that he and the director should choose to strip all of the things that made the original such a masterpiece. The most glaring and shameful omission is the soundtrack, with LaBute alleged to have stated that he would not want anyone who likes the original soundtrack to watch his movie, anyway.What an insufferable flap of useless skin.Gone too is the British location, as well as the concept of temptation, as Cage's Edward Malus has no Christian values to defend. The whole point of the original is that Woodward's character is a devout man and, by resisting the pleasures of the flesh presented in the form of Britt Ekland, he proves himself to be truly righteous. Such subtleties are dispensed with here.And as for Nic Cage, this is a performance so lacklustre you genuinely question whether this could truly be a professional actor. For a man who gets paid rather handsomely for his services, his abilities seem to be draining away with every passing year.It's been a while since a movie angered me so - you have to go back to Transformers for that - so do yourself a favour: avoid this like the plague.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose that if you've never seen the 1973 version then you might get something out of this - there is, after all, a tolerable sense of unworldliness about the location, and a sense of wrongness about the strange community into which Cage's cop intrudes.But, considering how much this remake lifts from the original, it is absolutely astonishing how much it gets wrong. There is a wholly unnecessary backstory which means the film takes 20 minutes to get to where the original started. The ending should be one of the most shocking endings ever: it isn't, because it is so thoroughly telegraphed in advance, and then so risibly overstated when it gets there, not to mention being followed up by a totally unnecessary postscript. Cage is just awful. His character lacks any of the subtext of Woodward's Howie, and he ends up being a gung-ho, door kicking thug. I could g on. Others have.Save your money - watch the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wicker Man One Of The Worst Movies Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wicker Man is one of the worst movies ever made. No offense to Nicolas Cage who is a talented actor and everyone else involved in making this movie. But is really was that bad. The Wicker Man is another remake in a long line of films (Friday The 13, Halloween, and My Blood Valentine which wasn't that bad to name a few) being re-imagined these days. The Wicker Man offers nothing new and is just a weird movie unfortunately not in a good way from start to finish. Nicolas Cage who can show he's a gifted actor even feels like he's on autopilot through the whole movie. The rest of the supporting cast including some wasted cameos are okay in their roles but no one stands out. So I say skip The Wicker Man because it's not that very good. But if you want to see an entertaining horror film instead of a movie that disguises itself as one I suggest you go rent 30 Days Of Night or My Bloody Valentine. At least those are somewhat entertanining movies because The Wicker Man isn't unfortunately. The talents of Nicolas Cage and the rest of the cast are wasted in a movie that should never have been remade in the first place. Who's dumb idea was it to make this anyway? Because The Wicker Man is nothing more than a lame attempt at a remake. Save yourself the time and money. Don't see it. You won't be missing much at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of the original film, I was suspect of this remake. However, it is a cool plot, Nick Cage and Ellen Burstyn seemed suitable for their respected roles, and maybe it would spark an interest in a new audience to check out the original, so I gave this film the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, none of the above was accurate.The plot is slightly different, but every actor and actress in this film was mediocre at best. Cage and Burstyn were stale. Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee should be insulted. In fact the whole film looks like it was done in one take! Finally, if Kate Beahan does not win a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress, it shall be deemed the biggest injustice in cinematic history! So for those who are curious to see The Wicker Man, please heed this advice: Avoid the theatre and rent the original (try to find the extended version, though rare to locate). It has a superior cast and, quite simply, is miles upon miles more intense and disturbing than the remake could possibly try to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this some kind of joke?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some film projects should never be allowed to get passed the idea stage. This includes remakes, but if the people involved have actually come up with an interesting way of retelling the story then why try and stop them? Neil LaBute found success as first a playwright and eventually an acclaimed filmmaker. When it was announced that he would both write and direct Robin Hardy's 1973 Horror classic 'The Wicker Man,' people jumped out of windows. But since many of LaBute's prior works had done well and the remake's cast is made up of some great talents, how could it possibly miss? No one knew just what they were in for going into this film, but after it came out it quickly became one of the most laughed at fiascoes of recent years. Maybe LaBute had good intentions and really wanted to make something that would be remembered and boy did he succeed there, but that's not exactly a good thing.Pros: Great cast that does it's best, especially Ellen Burstyn who makes the most of her minimal screen time. Beautiful scenery. Awesome score, better than this film deserves. Some disturbing imagery. Fast-paced and unintentionally humorous final act.Cons: Lousy writing, including some really poor dialogue. Pretty dull and uneventful for most of it's running time. Lacking in real suspense. Nicholas Cage goes way over-the-top in the final third and it's painful to watch. Dream sequences that serve no other purpose than to be filler. Plot holes big enough to drive a truck through. Replacing the paganism vs. Christianity of the original with a New Age mysticism was an interesting change, but it ends up being a wasted opportunity.Final thoughts: In a perfect world this movie would be just a bad dream, but unfortunately it really exists and many have suffered through it. Who exactly was this ill-conceived remake made for anyway? It looks good, has a wonderful cast, and a director who has proved he has great talent, but this is a mess of epic proportions. After watching it I don't blame Robin Hardy for not wanting anything to do with this. Do yourself a favor and watch the original again, or for the first time if you've yet to see it, and use the disc for this remake as a coaster.My rating: 1.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely among the leaders for Worst Remake Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The folks responsible for this remake should be more ashamed of themselves than the people who make bestiality porn. Not only have they taken a minor classic of the horror genre and crapped all over it, but they made a PG-13 version of the story and let Neil LaBute waste more of the public's time with his tiresome misogyny. So this movie is not just bad. It's also insulting pointless and socially offensive, but not in the good way horror films are supposed to be socially offensive.Edward Malus (Nicholas Cage) is a California motorcycle cop. While on patrol one day, he sees a toy fall out of the window of a passing station wagon. He picks up the toy and pulls the vehicle over to return it to the little girl who dropped it. Then a semi runs into the station wagon and sets it on fire. Edward tries to save the little girl, who doesn't appear to be bothered at all by the crash or the flames, but the car explodes and the bodies of the girl and her mother are never found. I'm gonna tell you right now that nothing in this scene really has anything to do with the rest of the story. I'm telling you this because on the off chance to make the mistake of renting the remake of The Wicker Man, you'll spend the rest of the movie wondering how this opening scene is going to connect to something later on in the film. It never does, so don't waste your time doing what I did and wondering how the little girl in the station wagon relates to the other little girl in the story because she aggravatingly doesn't.While on leave recovering from the station wagon incident, Edward receives a letter from his ex-fiancée. Writing in astonishingly good handwriting that looks like it came by time warp from the 1880s, his former love Willow (Kate Beahan) asks Edward to help her find her missing daughter. Rather than contact the local authorities, Edward travels to the private island off the coast of Washington state where Willow is living. When he arrives on Summersisle, Edward discovers a matriarchal village living like people back in the 1880s where no one will acknowledge Willow even having a daughter, let alone that anything happened to the girl. Edward continues his investigation, which stupidly doesn't seem to involve asking Willow any relevant questions about her daughter's disappearance, and uncovers signs that the island villagers are involved in some sort of pagan cult that may have sacrificed Willow's daughter to appease their gods. But after a whole bunch of contrived and manufactured scenes of Edward going hither and yon all over the island, where it's definitively proved that a guy wearing a suit and riding a bike looks like doofus no matter how dramatic the situation is supposed to be, Edward finds out the real plans of the villagers for the little girl and for himself.Oh, this is a stupidly written movie. It's even much, much worse than your average stupidly written movie. That's because it sticks fairly closely to the plot of the original The Wicker Man and that was a relatively well written film. So, writer/director Neil LaBute started out with all the elements of a smartly written story. He then proceeded to remove almost all of the intelligent bits of the script and insert a bunch of truly dumb stuff. Imagine taking your mom's recipe for apple pie and substituting dog turds for apples. That's pretty much what Neil LaBute did with The Wicker Man.Now, all movies require some suspension of disbelief, especially those dealing with fantastic subject matter. But suspension of disbelief does not mean accepting any idiotic thing thrown at you. The original film used a great deal of care and time to clearly explain and justify the pagan existence on the island. It gave you reasons for why the things that happened in the story happened the way they did. Suspension of disbelief is when you choose to accept the reasons a story gives you instead of questioning or trying to undermine them. The remake doesn't really give you any reasons for anything, so you can't help but notice how stupid and ridiculous the story is and how none of the characters act like real people.The most significant addition to the script is that instead of being generic pagans who worship all nature, Neil LaBute turned them into a matriarchal cult of Gaia worshippers. The villagers are overwhelmingly female and the few men on the island are essentially reduced to subhuman laborers. If you don't know anything about Neil LaBute's previous films, you might just think it's something odd that doesn't make a lot of sense. But when you connect it with his other movies and how they regarded women, you can't deny that LaBute has some very serious problems when it comes to the female of the species. The original movie was about the conflict between Christianity/modernity and paganism. This movie is about Man's justifiable fear and hatred of Woman. 1973's The Wicker Man was an argument against primitive superstition. 2006's The Wicker man is an argument against letting women vote or ever having any power or authority.Outside of the single F-word all PG-13 films seem to have, this remake has no nudity, less sex, less violence and less overall frightening stuff than the original. Now, there are a lot of movies that get remade for very questionable reasons. But what could possibly be the purpose for remaking a horror film and making a tamer, less shocking version of it?If you haven't seen the original version of The Wicker Man, go out and rent it today. Do not, under any circumstances, watch the remake.</fullReview>

It seems with the script unfolding, everyone on the set, actors and crew alike, was infected by the same virus Cage actually seemed to be carrying(he was not asked anymore to play the confused dope addict, he gradually turned into one).

		<fullReview>The motivation behind remakes has changed recently. It used to be "we're remaking this as we want to pay homage to the original" whereas now its "the original sucked. Our version has got to be better.". Well, the Nicholas Cage 'Wicker Man' is not in any way superior to Robin Hardy's 1973 classic. It tells the same story ( more or less ) with a cop arriving at a secluded island to investigate a complaint about a missing child, but the spooky atmosphere of the original is totally absent. What's with the bees? I thought I was watching a remake of 'The Swarm' instead. Ellen Burstyn does the best she can, but the end result is like a bad made-for-television movie ( 'The Dark Secret Of Harvest Home' starring Bette Davis did a similar idea but better ). Thank goodness the ending is intact. I was half expecting a platoon of marines to storm the island and rescue Malus before the wicker man burned up. Even so this is yet another pointless remake of a '70's classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a travesty. This is the worst remake of a classic English movie that I have ever seen. Why don't these guys leave things alone if they don't have the skills to make at least a half decent version. I will definitely be looking out for the Directors name with a HUGE AVOID written against it. Thanks for wasting my time.... At least the TV station that played it had the good sense to show the Edward Woodward version after it. I still cannot understand how people get the money or the nerve to remake movies that have an obvious Strong Following by people with equally strong opinions. The director does no one, especially himself any favors by butchering such films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>California police officer is summoned to an isolated island to investigate the disappearance of a girl and instead discovers that the bizarre islanders are harboring some dark secrets.The Wicker Man 2006 is one of the most unnecessary remakes to ever be thrown onto a movie screen. Like Gus Van Sant's 1998 remake of Psycho, The Wicker Man is such a classic that the films plot is common knowledge and a remake that produces no twists on the original storyline is just useless. The entire film never manages to create any suspense or surprise, and the plot just meanders along for 100 minutes never picking up speed. Then, of course, comes the 'shocking' conclusion that we've seen coming since 1973! This remake is just a waste of money that could have gone to make a better film. The cast is OK, alas they have little to work with here. The only thing that saves me from completely BOMBing this turgid remake was the unintentionally hilarious scene where Nicholas Cage karate kicks Leelee Sobieski in the face! That's definitely the highlight of the movie, unfortunately it's over in three seconds. Shame.* 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good grief, a real mixed bag this one. I had heard so many bad things that I was expecting a huge dino-turd of a movie. I guess, from the comments here and the reviews elsewhere, many people will think the same thing before viewing this movie.And then it started and it started, as far as I was concerned, reasonably well. The introduction of Nic Cage's character and the trauma he has been through is nicely sketched in, as is his arrival at Summersisle and his initial introduction to the peculiar ways of the locals and their matriarchal society ruled over by Ellen Burstyn (most people should already be aware that this sticks closely to the original idea of an outsider arriving to try and find a missing child, but all is not as it seems).In fact, up until the familiar classroom scene I was actually quite enjoying this movie. Astounding as that may sound. A few nice references and familiar characters certainly helped in that regard, a brave move from people remaking such a revered cult classic.And then the bees start dominating proceedings because OH Summersisle has a lot of bees and Nicolas Cage is ALLERGIC to bee stings (hmmmmmm, you think that might crop up again later???). Things start sliding downhill. FAST!!! I cannot begin to describe how laughably bad things get, and how drastically they do deteriorate once things unravel. Things build up to a completely mediocre climax that retains not even a shadow of the power shown by the original, and it doesn't help that Cage really has very little passion in his protests fired at the locals who seem to be conspiring against him.Forgive the ambiguity, I AM trying to still keep things relatively spoiler free here for those who have yet to see any version of the story. If you haven't then I highly suggest that you give the original a try, at the very least, before subjecting yourself to this nonsense.Anyway, things start off at about 4/10 so that's what I gave as my rating but they certainly dip to 3/10 at most by the finale. It's a bit of a shame because, despite the overwhelming negatives throughout, there are a few shining moments of wit and intelligence that make you think those involved did actually care about what they were doing. It's just a shame that they didn't seem to care enough to realise the second half of the film was completely useless and should have been started over from scratch.See this if you like: Down AKA The Shaft, Nicolas Cage, bees on film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless and bad remake of an excellent original movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I do need to make it clear that I am a huge fan of the original movie, so I came to watch this remake with deep reservations. The trailers and commercials I saw before actually seeing the movie suggested to me that this would be bad. But it was worse than I thought. The whole basis of the original story was that the Pagan cult living on the island needed a pure sacrifice to atone for whatever wrongs they had done that caused a bad harvest the year before. Sgt. Howie (a great performance by Edward Woodward)in the original movie was a virginal fundamentalist Christian with deep religious convictions and a strong sense of duty. Cage's character is simply a stock guilt-ridden Nicholas Cage character that we have seen in god knows how many movies previously. Sgt. Howie is outraged and offended by the paganism of the island and in particular its overtly sexual practices. Cage is offended because the island is run by women who appear to enslave men and use them only for heavy lifting and breeding. This last thing is one of the things that irritated me most. The original Summerisle was ruled feudal fashion by Lord Summerisle, the deliciously suave and malevolent Christopher Lee. The men were willing and equal partners with the women of the island in all of their practices and there is a nice little scene in the schoolhouse of the girls being taught to worship penises.The remake has stolen ideas from the old made for TV movie Dark Secret of Harvest Home, (some of the mutilation scenes are straight out of Harvest Home) and made the men irrelevant for the most part. Was this only so that Cage could shout out at the end "You bitches!!"? Cage's outrage in the movie seems strongly related to the matriarchal culture there, and I sense a strong thread of misogyny throughout the movie. There is no real development of the pagan culture here, unlike the original movie. There are just the stock clichés that make the whole thing seem ridiculous as opposed to frightening. This is a horror movie for those who need everything explained to them. You are not permitted to slowly develop the dawning realization that there is something really bad going on here - everything has to be explained. Cage also needs everything explained. And if he can't find people to answer his questions, he conveniently finds a book that tells him what he needs to know. Really dumb stuff: 1. The missing girl becomes his daughter in the remake thus changing his motivation from that of a dedicated police officer to that of a father. 2. He waves his gun around and threatens people with it but the only time it would have really been useful to him he does not use it. 3. The missing girl's last name is changed to Woodward. As Cage's character's name is Edward, was this some sort of homage to Edward Woodward? 4. The women's names are all changed to add "Sister" in front of them, "Miss Rose" becomes "Sister Rose" etc. 5. The island's name is changed to "Summersisle" - with the addition of an "s" - probably because there is a real Summer Isle, and they wanted nothing to do with this botched up remake. One good thing about the movie is that they did not change the ending. I really worried that they would and Cage would run off with his new wife and child to live happily forever after. But still, the ending has none of the creepy power of the original with the whole village joining hands and singing "Summer is a-comin' in" while poor Sgt. Howie is praying to God and reciting biblical verses. (Parenthetically, when I showed the original to my older sister a few years ago, she was outraged at the ending and accused me of having no morals for enjoying a movie where a decent god-fearing man was burnt to death.) Sadly,I doubt whether or not an American movie could be made in these days where a deeply fundamentalist Christian could be killed off by pagans, and that is really too bad, because losing the element of the conflict between belief systems really weakens this movie. Plus, it eliminates the whole sexual element that underlay the original movie so effectively. The only reason I gave this film a 3 rather than a 1 was because it was professionally done with good production values and I suppose that has to count for something. The actors did what they could with a really bad script. I don't mind Nicholas Cage but he really should just retire if he plans on playing the same guy in every movie from now until the end of his career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I have to be honest and say that this needless remake wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Of course, we really didn't need a new version of The Wicker Man, but in it's own right; this 2006 version is an ineptly hilarious take on Robin Hardy's original and if nothing else, I'm sure that even die hard fans of the original would have to admit that seeing Nicholas Cage running around in a bear suit beating women up is funny. Of course, it would have been a lot funnier if he wasn't doing it under the title of The Wicker Man. Naturally, the film has been Americanized and the action has moved from a Scottish island to one in the Pacific. Nicholas Cage's copper, Edward Malus, witnesses a horrific traffic accident and is then invited to the island after finding out that he has a daughter on there and she has gone missing. However, when he gets there it would seem that things aren't quite right with the island. All the authority figures are women for a start, and everyone pretends not to have heard of the girl, despite evidence to the contrary...There were two principal things that made the original great; the character of Sergeant Howie and the mysterious atmosphere. This film lacks both elements, as Cage's copper is too ridiculous and pathetic to be likable, while the atmosphere is replaced by a series of odd events that don't really hold much interest. Christopher Lee's Lord Summerisle has been replaced by Ellen Burstyn's Sister Summersisle, and somehow we don't get the same effect. There is a whole load of ridiculous dialogue and stupid goings on in this film, and its great fun to watch. Seeing Cage go round forcing all the children to take off their masks and kicking one of the sisters in the face really is hilarious, and it's hard to believe that the people involved in this film were really taking it seriously. This is the first film I've seen from Neil LaBute, but I've heard he's a credible director so I'm guessing he got paid well. Cage also has a producer's credit for this film, however, so it would seem that this remake is more his show than LaBute's. The ending is intact, but rather than being horrifying as it was in the original; this time it's just a way for the film to end. The Wicker Man remake is not a good film, but I actually had fun watching it. Recommended if you want a good laugh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lazy production that is short on thrills and suspense but high on laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage), a California highway patrol officer, finds himself on the reclusive island of Summerisle looking for a lost girl after receiving a mysterious letter from a woman from his past (Kate Beahan). Nothing on the island appears to be quite what it seems and as his search hits dead end after dead end he grows more and more desperate.While watching The Wicker Man, I thought it was supposed to be a thriller with some comical elements thrown in since the film attempted to be scary and it was pretty funny. To my infinite amusement, the four genres listed on IMDb are drama, horror, thriller and mystery. I can't believe that a filmmaker (save Uwe Boll and Ed Wood) could fail so horribly at creating a horror film but Neil LaBute does just that. Well, I haven't seen the original but I'm willing to bet that some thought went into that production although I can't say the same thing here. The screenplay was awful, filled with horrible dialog and a bunch of silly sequences that will encourage laughter more than anything else. The story itself was interesting but the way they played it out was just silly and obvious.After a fast introduction of Cage's character, things quickly go downhill when he actually lands on the island. The residents are awful at lying and watching them interact with Cage's character was just annoying. So, the audience spends about an hour watching Cage search the island for clues and it's quite unexciting since it's really just him scaring himself and interacting with badly written characters. I really have no idea what the director was trying to accomplish here. He portrayed the women of Summerisle as all men hating, hard working and distant freaks. He portrayed Cage as a sturdy policeman but he wasn't able to see through them. Neil did have a good filming location and that island was pretty creepy since it had that fear of isolation and being unable to communicate with other people that weren't on the island. Besides for that, Neil pretty much threw in the towel on everything else.The acting was awful and the absurdity of the dialog messed up all of the performances. Nicolas Cage was just terrible in the leading role. His facial reactions were over the top and his line delivery was very non convincing. Kate Beahan just had this wide eye look on her face throughout the entire thing and she easily gave the worst performance. Ellen Burstyn was shockingly horrible and this is one film she should not be remembered for. I used to like Leelee Sobieski but her performance here was pretty bad especially during her fight scene with Cage. Everyone else was bad but the previous four stand out as the worst of the bunch. Overall, The Wicker Man failed on many levels and it's not worth watching. Rating 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Step Away From The Bike!" --- Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wicker Man" (2006) Directed By: Neil LaBute Starring: Nicolas Cage, Ellen Burstyn, Kate Beahan, Frances Conroy, Molly Parker, Leelee Sobieski, &amp; Diane Delano MPAA Rating: "PG-13" (for disturbing images and violence, language and thematic issues) I am going to be open and completely honest with you. I have never seen "The Wicker Man" (1973) and, in all honesty, had never even heard about it until this remake was announced. Before I saw the remake, I did a little research on the original?and, immediately, I knew that the filmmakers behind this project had made a grave mistake. "The Wicker Man" (1973) has a very strong fan base and it features Christopher Lee as the main villain--yes, the Christopher Lee. Who could they possibly find to replace him? However, I was intrigued by the casting. Nicolas Cage signed on as our main character and, I'll be honest, I'm a fan of his. And Ellen Burstyn agreed to take over the role made infamous by Lee (the role was changed from male to female). I don't know about you, but Burstyn can do no wrong in my book. She's a fantastic actress. Still, I didn't expect anything new from this remake, especially after critics practically buried it alive and my fellow IMDb users wasted very little time in sinking its rating to the bottom of the barrel. Then, a video surfaced on the internet, featuring a few select scenes extracted from the film. I watched it and the small slice of hope I had for this was obliterated. The scenes looked horrible. They were so serious?yet so comical. Nothing in them worked. But, did "The Wicker Man" (2006) work better as a whole?or was it just as bad as these scenes suggested.Edward Malus (Cage) is a Californian police officer, who is summoned by his ex-fiancé, Willow (Beahan), to Summersisle, a remote and private island off of the coast of Washington. Willow tells him that her daughter recently vanished and that she still must be on the island, as she was too young to leave by herself. Willow suspects that someone on the island may be doing horrible things to her child and desperately needs Edward to come and launch an investigation. Edward complies and travels to the island?only to find that it is home to a secretive, neo-pagan cult led by the dominating Sister Summersisle (Burstyn). No one on the island wants to cooperate, all claiming that the little girl either never existed or was burned alive accidentally. Edward continues to dig deeper into the cult's haunting past and learns off all of their rituals--including sacrifice to appease their goddess. But, nothing can prepare him for the shocking truth that will lead to the exposure of the Wicker Man?and its chilling purpose for being built. This plot is very similar to the original, even down to the names of its characters (there are a few changes). So, really, what is the point? This was my biggest complaint for "The Omen" (2006), but this movie seems to be desperate to embarrass the name of the original whereas "The Omen" (2006) actually worked as a nice companion to its predecessor.The performances in "The Wicker Man" (2006) are surprisingly terrible. I never thought that this would be a complaint I had with this remake, but it most certainly is. The entire cast seems so bored and so lifeless that you cannot feel for any of the characters. Nicolas Cage gives, in my brutally honest opinion, the worst performance of the year. He is bland and painfully laughable. He did not even try to make his role any better than it was. It was embarrassing to watch him hang his head and give up on this film. Ellen Burstyn has done wrong?I know, the actress who "can do no wrong in my book" actually can do wrong and she did here. Her performance was over-the-top and comical, not working in any particular way. She doesn't come off as a particularly evil villain, but she doesn't appear to be a religious-fanatic bent on purifying her followers either. She just looks and acts like a nut the entire movie. Kate Beahan looked sleepy the entire movie and collected her paycheck. I don't have any complaints about Frances Conroy. She delivered her dialog with ample conviction, though she was instantly forgettable. I can't necessarily blame the cast for not being good, because they were given nothing to do and no substance to work with. They, like the rest of the filmmakers behind this movie, were obviously here for the paycheck.When "Scary Movie 5" is made (and you know that it will eventually happen), I don't expect to see "The Wicker Man" (2006) on its list of movies to be spoofed. No, not because it flopped (grossing approximately $23.6 million domestically on a $40 million budget), but because this movie is a comedy in itself. "The Wicker Man" (2006) is an unintentionally comical film. It could have been the best comedy of the year, had it actually meant to make us laugh. But no, the movie wanted to be a bleak, dark, and depressing thriller that disturbed its audience and left them feeling weak and down on life. I should never have laughed and yet I found my sides hurting from all of the laughter I was experiencing. This is ultimately an embarrassing, disastrous remake that should be forgotten altogether except when people are making their "Bottom 10" lists. Avoid this at all costs. I leave you with the most memorable quote in this movie screamed by Edward as he is tortured with bees: "Oh no, not the bees! Not the bees! All over my eyes!"! Final Thought: I laughed more than I screamed?and that is a bad thing.Overall Rating: 2/10 (C-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was it necessary to remake The wicker man(1973)?The original film is an excellent film and a very little quantity of people saw it but...Is it valid to destroy a real art film with the intention that more people get access to the story?No,by my point of view.The wicker man(2006)is an unnecessary and very mediocre remake made by the acclaimed director and screenwriter Neil LaBute.If you saw the original film from 1973,do not see this film.LaBute does not give nothing good to the story and the additions he did are clichés from horror movies(What was that noise?I'll investigate...Oh!,It was a bird).But,having said that,I have to say LaBute gave a good atmosphere to the movie.Nicolas Cage does a good work as the main character but it's easy to note his absence of conviction on some occasions.On this movie,this actor almost always fails because he does not show conviction.Ellen Burstyn,Molly Parker and Frances Conroy do not act bad on this movie but,here,they cannot show all the talent they have.The wicker man(2006)is a mediocre and unnecessary remake with a lot of clichés.I totally recommend the original movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had seen both the original, with Christopher Lee, and the new one. I liked them both. They may not necessarily be your "Average" horror movies, but both are amazingly deep in their subject matter. Looking past whatever arguments other posters have to say about these movies the plot is rich and full and keep the viewer guessing until the end. The first one was much better at keeping the viewer guessing because Christopher Lee is such a good actor and movie goers expected to have to think when they went and saw a movie.The new movie was "dumbed down" quite a bit because modern movie-goers seem to want everything spelled out to them, which is why I think movies in general are going down the tubes. There is no more critical thinking or discussion about movies anymore. Everything is spelled out and explained to the fullest extent so no one has to come up with their own opinions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake guaranteed to upset the purists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in a while a remake of a classic film actually manages to improve on the original. This isn't one of those films. Like many remakes, this is a film that didn't need to be made. Neil La Bute has taken Robin Hardy's 1973 original and updated Anthony Shaffer's script and added several new elements which are both unnecessary and serve to dilute the original ingredients that remain. A masterpiece of British Cinema has been toned down and turned into an anti-feminist tract. Those that complained that the original dwelt somewhat lasciviously on the bodies of the various naked women on display would be surprised to discover that although the nudity has been dispensed with this time round, the film manages to be even more offensive to women (especially in its several scenes of violence against women by its leading male character).Summerisle has now become Summersisle, a commune on an island dominated almost entirely by women and headed by Sister Summersisle (Ellen Burstyn). The presence of men is tolerated only for the purposes of breeding and the number of pregnant women attests to the potency of its few male inhabitants in stark contrast to the failure of the recent crop of honey that is the island's lifeblood. As a result, Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) is lured to the island on the pretext of searching for the missing daughter of an ex-fiancée (the fact it never occurs to him to ask his ex-fiancée right at the beginning if the missing girl could be his daughter is one of the many logical improbabilities that La Bute saddles himself with in making changes to Anthony Shaffer's original screenplay).Malus is a tortured character, suffering from nightmares after a traffic accident at the beginning of the film which means we are bludgeoned over the head with constant flashbacks to the accident to remind us that this is a man seeking redemption. We get it, even though the accident is clearly that and not the result of a character defect on Malus's part that requires him to make amends (unless you consider doing a good deed as a character defect). If the story really needed to be about a man seeking redemption (which Anthony Shaffer clearly thought it didn't), then Cage's character should have made some form of mistake for which he feels the need to atone. The reason that La Bute presents us with doesn't cut it and if the character motivation doesn't work, then the whole plot doesn't work (and it doesn't).La Bute manages to botch the ending that was so powerful in the original. In order to get a 12A (PG-13 in the U.S.), not only has all the nudity gone (which was relevant in the original in order to highlight Woodward's distaste at the sexually free world in which he found himself), the violence has had to be toned down as well. Which means that the moment in which Cage has his legs broken is done to a black screen with Cage screaming "Aaarggh, my legs!", so we know what has happened. This renders the scene laughable and ruins any tension which has built up. Completely unnecessary since Anthony Shaffer did not see the need to make Woodward's character suffer the same fate in the original.Still, it's not all bad. Leelee Sobieski is a welcome presence in any film and the very last scene in the film is a neat conceit even though it is another of La Bute's additions. And the few in-jokes are amusing enough (a photograph on the wall in the police station shows Edward Woodward as he looked in the original underneath the caption "Wanted". Plus the fact that Cage's character's first name is Edward and the surname of his fiancée and daughter is Woodward). Nevetheless, this is yet another pointless remake (not as bad as "Rollerball" perhaps, but that's not saying much). Still I have high hopes for the recently announced remake of "The Dambusters". With Peter Jackson at the helm, I think this film may do the subject justice and be at least one remake good enough to take its place alongside the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting premise, ridiculous ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie started out with an interesting plot. Dished out bits of information slowly, upping the suspense in a slow but steady way. Beautiful scenery. I'd love to live in a place like that. Without all the freaks, of course. But what a stupid ending. I kept expecting Cage's character to wake up and find out he'd been given the wrong medicine and was having really bad hallucinations. That would have been a better ending, in my humble opinion. The ending was one of those twists just for the shock value. No good reason for it to end that way. Frankly, it was a let down. I felt cheated as a viewer. I actually paid to see this movie, and I came away completely unsatisfied. There were things unexplained, like the accident. Was that somehow orchestrated by the freaks? And why was he having the hallucinations? Were the freaks giving him drugs? It wasn't explained, and it should have been.I liked Nicholas Cage's character, but boy did I despise the character of Willow. She seemed retarded, or high on drugs or something. And her expression never changed throughout the whole movie. Not even at the end when her evil deed was made known. I suppose that was to make her a sympathetic character, just doing as she was told to do, but I didn't buy it. She was just as evil as all the rest of them. I would have liked to see the burning wicker man fall on top of them and kill them all. Or at least another failed honey crop. Or then, that there might have been one bullet left...to kill either Willow or her evil mother with. I think the writer just didn't know how else to end it. The worse is to think that money was spent to make this movie...twice!! Gah!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of the very WORST movies I have ever seen. From Nicholas Cage's Hysterics to the boorish "mystery" of the plot. It makes "Night of the Lepus" look like a Academy Award Winner. I bet the Porn industry knockoff "Evening of the Dicker Man" makes more money that this. On a sad note... What the heck was Neil Labute thinking! They must have kidnapped his poodle and threatened to send the cute little pooch to Iraq to get him to make this film. Another promising artist ruined by a certain producers need ( I groaned with dread when I saw his name in the opening credits... BUT... at least you might see some hot babes. What a foolish presumption that turned out to be) need to churn out cheap schlock hoping a name actor could fool enough rubes into spending a chunk of their teeny tiny paychecks in the hope they will be able to forgot about being poor. Ohh Mr Producer darling.... You have an Island full of hot Wiccan Pagen babes and not ONE of them gets naked!!! A festival celebrating fertility with NO SEX!!! By the end of this travesty I would have begged to see Ellen Burstyn nude just to relieve the assault on my psyche.Would someone let me know if a class action suit is filed to get our money back? Thanks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was fairly good until the end completely spoils the entire thing. DON'T see this movie if you want to feel good at all after. I have never felt as bad about an ending to a movie as this film. Everything else wasn't bad, in fact was rather suspenseful , however the ending (which I am trying to not divulge) is horrendous). Please take my advice as a Nicholas Cage fan, don't go see it. I really am sorry for the time I spent watching it. I now wonder if the first Wicker Man was as badly ended as this edition. Again try and avoid this if you don't want to be angry. Having second thoughts abut writing this piece because ten lines is way to many to have to explain that the ending of the movie was totally inadequate. In summation I would say don't go see this movie. Summary: Don't see it! How many times do I have to say IN SUMMATION I would not recommend this movie? That is the summation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't waste your money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never before been compelled to write a review on a movie that was bad. UNTIL NOW. I mean was this movie supposed to be about witchcraft or cults or women in power or was it just SUPPOSED to be a thriller? It was never clear, but it was never any of these. It started out great - for about 10 minutes and went straight downhill. I went with 2 friends - girls night out and all 3 of us were extremely disappointed.HERE's the spoiler - This movie had so many ridiculously unrelated and stupid parts. What was in the burlap bag that was bleeding everywhere. Someone help me here... did that ever play out? The biggest one was killing the float boat pilot. I guess the idea was to make you think that these STRANGE women didn't want anyone to come to their island so the float boat captain that brought this stranger here was being punished. Then you find out the whole reason for the movie was to bring the stranger to the island and yet they kill the float boat boat pilot who presumably was the person who was bringing all of the supplies to the island. I cannot express here how TRULY disappointed I was by this movie and am really wondering what in the work Nicolas Cage was thinking when he took this role. Is this the best that Hollywood can do? Come on - I'm going to stop WASTING my money. This movie wasn't even good enough to waste your money on renting, let alone the outrageous price of a ticket and popcorn at the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My opinion on "The Wicker Man."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of horror/suspense films. I went to the theatres with my friends, and we decided to see "The Wicker Man." And oh boy, that was a mistake.It was obvious that the movie was an attempt at some sort of a "scary movie." It was also painfully clear, half way through, that it had failed horribly in it's attempts to thrill me. I'm not that hard to scare, seeing as the movie "Darkness" made me jump in my seat.The plot was poorly constructed: the beginning of the movie bored me extensively, and the end half made me laugh until my stomach hurt. Admittingly, there were several short moments that were placed in the movie for comic relief, but they weren't enough to make up for the impression I had. There was one climax, at the end of the movie; barely any resolution. The last five minutes was supposed to be a cliffhanger. It made absolutely no sense. The only way you would understand the short ending, was if you had spent 10 minutes thinking up theories. However, I was left with too bad of an impression to even think twice about what it could have meant.I could tell that I wasn't the only one who thought this. The rest of the audience laughed at the "scary" scenes, as well. Not only were jokes made, but chatter could be heard in the theatre throughout the movie.In compensation, this would be a delightful movie to you if you're looking for something to laugh at.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so awful! It is not "scary" - little children in the theater were laughing out loud. Burstyn and Cage must have owed someone or some company a very big favor that made them agree to appear in this dog. There is no character development; there are many questions left unasked and unanswered. When Cage meets up with his old flame, there is nothing about them together that suggests chemistry, now or ever. The story comes across as misogynistic AND misanthropic, as well as anti-law and order. The island society's reasons for holding onto these beliefs is baffling; somehow these beliefs are connected to the successful raising of bees. Hunh...! It is a waste of time and money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insipid, pointless - I want my money back!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been an avid fan of the original for years. I was one of the people who petitioned Anchor Bay to release it on DVD. That being said, Nicholas Cage has single-handedly done the biggest blasphemy to any film I've ever witnessed. SPOILERS I walked out of this "remake" last night so utterly appalled that I nearly demanded my money back. Everything about it was terrible. Cage's acting couldn't have been worse. Here's my rant about the story and characters: The original: Willow McGregor is the Landlord's Daughter (the man who runs the Green Man Inn) who is seen as a goddess (portrayed by Britt Eckland). The remake: Willow Woodward (I'm assuming the last name is an homage to Edward Woodward who portrayed Neil Howie, the police officer in the original) is somehow the ex-love of Cage's police officer character who now has a daughter who is missing that he must find. The original character is somehow taken over by a less-than-enthusiastic Leelee Sobiesky. The original: Rowan Morrison is the girl who is missing, she is the daughter of May Morrison who runs the local sweet shop/post office. The remake: it's the bees/honey crop that fails. The original: it's the apple crop that fails. The remake: set on an island off Pugit Sound called Summersisle (they added an "s), a neo-pagan "sisterhood" of women rules. Sister Summersisle is played by Ellen Burstyn. The original: set on a small Scottish island of Summerisle, a neo-pagan community rules. Lord Summerisle is played by Christopher Lee. The remake: the maypole outside the school is shown but not used, and the teacher is a complete b****. The original: the maypole has a whole song and dance dedicated to it and the teacher offers a lot of information on their society. The remake: Ellen Burstyn is a whispy ruler who is almost too nice at times and lives in a weird bee mansion. The original: Chrisopher Lee is pleasant but rules with an iron fist and lives in a classic Scottish/British mansion. The remake: Nicholas Cage turns in a horrid performance as an out-of-luck police officer who tries to find his daughter and ends up in a trap in which he becomes the sacrifice. The original: Edward Woodward turns in a tour-de-force performance as a Christian officer dealing with Pagans and genuinely interested in helping the girl who has supposedly been kidnapped. He suffers the same fate, burned alive in the Wicker Man. The remake: the whole community is in on the plot, but they are more into creeping Cage out than offering him any real insight into their culture. The original: the whole community is in on the plot, but they're doing it as a classic festival in celebration of the Celtic god of the orchard and goddess of the field. The original ends with the Wicker Man crumbling and the villagers singing the folk song "Summer Is A-Cumin' In." The remake ends after the Wicker Man tumbles and then Leelee Sobiesky and Willow end up recruiting more men for their little plot. There are many more, but I don't feel like going on an even bigger tirade. This is a testament of why movies should NOT be remade. Nicholas Cage should be ashamed of himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless, stupefying thriller...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>California policeman, recovering from a roadside accident in which he apparently failed to save two lives, is summoned to a remote island near Pugent Sound by an ex-girlfriend who says her young daughter is missing. Misguided remake of an acclaimed 1973 British thriller gives star Nicolas Cage an ungainly role, that of cop/detective/hero/target, in which he is resolutely miscast (Cage also co-produced the film). The illogical, muddled narrative is full of false leads, false scares, red herrings and a twist finish that really isn't. The picture doesn't seem to have much of a point beyond equating power with sadism, or sexual preeminence with the ultimate religious fanaticism, but that lunkhead combination of proto-feminism with pagan worship results in nothing more than a ridiculous bait-and-switch. The island location is intriguing, and the film is well-made, but Cage strikes some ludicrous notes, and his character (a born chump) is far from a smart creation. * from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not having the privilege of seeing the original, I still think this movie was an absolute waste of time not to mention wasting my money to see it. Too bad there wasn't a satisfaction guarantee, because I would have taken them up on that one.They spent more time orchestrating the preview than the actual movie. The story line was so chopped up it left you wondering what in the world was going on. The humor they attempted was not funny, but ridiculous and out of place, however, it was a relief to actually understand something in the overall movie. This actually prompted the audience to start talking during the movie and make comments about what happened or what was about to happen. I have to admit that the movie was very suspenseful....it held you in suspense waiting for something to actually happen! Nicolas Cage constantly had a dumb look on his face as did all the other supporting actresses. The whole movie seemed as though they slapped it together just to get it done. Everyone in the movie, including Cage, had no personality at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE WICKER MAN of the 70's was the cult film of the 20th century. It gripped audiences with its terrifying themes and golden cast, including Christopher Lee as the mysterious Lord Summerisle, who appears so kind and helpful... but is the stepping stone which leads the dumbfounded lead Edward Woodward to his appointment with the Wicker Man.The 2006 remake is an awful step back from what the original film had in it. It's tacky and unbelievable as a film. The horror of the original was that it played with your mind by luring you into the possibility that the events of the film could happen... The American remake is just stupid, and the only thing that grips you is your hands around your neck as you try to strangle yourself just to get away from Cage's wooden acting.As an American, I can fairly say that British classics have to be left alone. Avoid this nightmare at all costs... I recommend this only to the die-hard Wicker Man fans and the British, and that's only because it'll give them a chance to throw the heads back and laugh at what a joke Hollywood have made of their beloved British classic.I salute you, British film makers! Hollywood have tried to better you and failed miserably.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie, having seen the original and quite curious as to what might have become of it. I anticipated a horrendous piece of cinema, unfit for film of any kind. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was right, but wrong at the same time.The 2006 version of The Wicker Man was absolutely atrocious, but in a way that made it absolutely hilarious. Much like chop-socky or MST3K, the film's flaws are so outrageous that they end up being silly rather than painful.Take for example, the scene towards the end where Cage is being led to the Wicker Man. He is screaming and yelling as the procession carries him forward. A loud THWACK sound is heard, followed by Cage screaming, "AHH MY LEG!!!" Or when he's in the head of the Wicker Man and Rowan is running toward it, holding a lit torch. Cage responds by saying something along the lines of, "Sweetie, drop the stick! Drop the stick, honey!" Nobody can act, the dramatic elements and suspense of the original are cut out, and the end result is a terrible piece of silliness. I recommend you see it in a few weeks, when theaters are empty and you and your friends can heckle it to your heart's content.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the heck did I just watch?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie for free at the local premiere along with a packed theater. The movie starts out very strong and draws the audience in immediately. I was very intrigued to see more, the plot seemed interesting and began to lure the audience in more when Nicolas Cage reached the island of Summersisle and threw even more twists. Then suddenly the plot went completely haywire and the movie turned into a spoof. The comic relief was witty at first, then took over the movie and turned into an unintentional laughfest. I found myself laughing more at this than I did at some comedy movies that I've seen! First off, this movie is NOT a horror film. I'm tired of these movies being advertised to appear as horror only to disappoint the viewer. This usually is reserved for M. Night Shyamalan films, but now appears to have expanded to others. The film is never scary a single time. Are these advertisers doing this on purpose in order to get money from the fans of the horror genre? Was Cage's dialogue SUPPOSED to be so funny? Toward the end when he's being hauled off by the island residents he begins screaming like a madman and tossing out comments that made the entire audience erupt in laughter. When he snapped earlier and began punching out female islanders the movie seemed to lose control. He even has a fistfight with one that should have lasted about 2 seconds, but instead was turned into a drawn out scene. What was even more hilarious was watching the woman he'd just knocked unconscious begin to overact and have wild facial expressions. I began to wonder if William Shatner had helped coach the actors.This movie was worthy of Mystery Science Theater 3000. I felt almost betrayed. I was actually drawn to care about the lead character before the script seemed to run out of ideas and drop dead. Why were so many plot lines given that went nowhere? This movie had more dead ends than a ghost town. Was there any point to the whole bee analogy? The opening scene was great, but what the heck did it have to do with the rest of the movie? It made no sense at all! Why was the teacher given some odd twin that served no purpose? What was the deal with the old woman twins who talked in unison the entire time? Why did they keep going back to the stupid cell phone that had no service, and why did they have it ring toward the end? Did they just need to fill time? Toward the end why was Ellen Burnstyn painted up like Mel Gibson in Braveheart? I kept waiting for her to shout "FREEDOM!" Finally, when they showed what the wicker man really was I wanted to faint. It looked like a Lego Wishnick Troll. I couldn't believe how fast this movie had deteriorated into a b-grade comedy. By the time the women were all chanting "The drone must die" I wanted to die myself. What a ridiculous and unintentionally funny scene.For your own sake, skip this movie! I saw it for free and even I felt ripped off. If you really feel that you have to see it, wait for it to be on cable or borrow the DVD from some Nicolas Cage fan.</fullReview>

I am a real Nic Cage fan...he rarely makes a misstep when choosing scripts, (notice I didn't say NEVER, I said RARELY) but this time he should have passed. Every "twist" I saw coming a mile away, including the ending. I knew he was being set up from the get-go and I knew that Leelee Sobieski was going to walk into that bar in the end. Even the acting was overwrought and as a woman, I resented the fact that when we actually see a society ruled by women, they are nothing more than a bunch of backwards, superstitious, man-hating loony tunes, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I have nothing against paganism, in fact I consider myself to be somewhat of a pagan, as I am not a fan of organized religion and believe that there is merit in herbal medicine and natural remedies. But these chicks belonged somewhere with upholstered walls, wearing those lovely jackets with the wrap-around arms. And his character deserved to be there as well for listening to his ex-fiancée, who acted like the female version of Rain Man. This movie was not worth the free ticket I used to see it.</fullReview>

One would ask why was Cage seeing so much illusions? was he high on drugs or medication? Many events in the movies are outright extraneous because they adds to the barage of confusion that the plot instills into the story already. Why and when his gun was unloaded of the bullets, and why would he not notice that if he already checked his clip once in the film? contradiction? Were not the antagonists in the final climax of the film not disabled by Cage? how did they show up at the end? and what's the point of the last part of the movie; to add to the insult the film producer has already done to viewers like me? Cage's performance was awful also, he acted like how he acted in every other film; I'd put Cage in the same category of actor as Keanu.

I do not criticise people who have seen and enjoyed this movie. Everybody has a different taste in film and this is only one opinion.One of the first failings it undertook was the fact that a remake cannot be made if the original is a cult classic. It is only a reason for Hollywood to show that they want to ruin a perfectly good film because they had no part in it being made.The second failing was if they were not going to change the plot, to give it a slightly different twist and to make it 'new', what point is there on watching it. People who have seen the original won't have anything to look forward to.My advice is, watch the original. Enjoy the original.

		<fullReview>Although the sets were beautiful and interesting, and the locale lush and serene, the rest of the movie just stunk. It's really too bad - the plot starts off intriguing, but early on you feel as though there's just ... something missing somehow, and that's usually a bad sign. I kept waiting for this movie to save itself somehow, but it all just became too predictable, and there wasn't enough done to paint the 'baddies' of the film in a truly menacing or deeply sinister light, surprising indeed given what the actual plot turns out to be -- I never really felt intimidated by them; I just thought they were odd.It wasn't the fault of the actors or actresses who all gave wonderful performances (although Nicolas Cage is somewhat controversial in this regard according to the forums for this film, I have always enjoyed watching him, though this one wasn't one of his best films). Instead, I lay blame to the screenwriter and the editor - sometimes no matter how much talent you have working on a project, if an editor pieces a film together poorly, there's nothing that can save it, and that's what seems to have happened in this case, which also explains why viewers feel much is missing from the film.It's worth a look on DVD, perhaps, at least because the plot is somewhat interesting for a good part of the movie. Ultimately, though, save your cash and stay far away from this stinker. Why oh why can't someone make a truly great horror / suspense film anymore??</fullReview>

This movie is Neil LaBute's first thriller ever and maybe he should leave it this way because this film is at no time at all even the slightest bit thrilling. The few shocking moments the film does contain are rubbish too. It really is a shame that an actor such as Nicolas Cage manages to get himself such a (excuse the language) crappy role.

The Wicker Man is comedic gold, it's one of the funniest movies of 2006, although it's a pity that it wasn't intended to be a comedy, had it been intended to be a comedy, then it probably would have been a smash hit. Everything from Nicholas Cage's over the top performance to the script has got loads of laughs in it. All throughout the course of the movie, I kept saying things like: "This is supposed to be scary?" or "This is supposed to be a horror movie?" Because judging from all of the unintentionally hysterical moments that occurred in this movie, I honestly believe that they made a mistake by marketing this movie as a horror movie. However, the unintentional hilarious values do make this movie worth watching, although it's not good as a horror movie, it does succeed at being an unintentional comedy. Want a good comedy? Simply watch this movie, you'll get your laughs out of it.Hands down, Nicholas Cage did the best acting in the film, as far as the laughs went. One scene in particular, he asks Kate Beahan about a doll: "How'd it get burned? How it get burned?! HOW'D IT GET BURNED?! HOW'D IT GET BURNED?!" She replies: "I DON'T KNOW!" Then there is a hilarious scene in which Cage goes around punching women in a bear suit, and it all cumulates with the infamous: "NOT THE BEES!" Scene. I have never seen Nicholas Cage overact so much before in any movie. Then again, I wouldn't be surprised if he knew that this movie was going to be bad, and so he decided to overact on purpose. However, I do give praise to Nicholas Cage for his results in bringing out comedy, which he definitely succeeds in doing, too bad that the movie was supposed to be a horror movie. And not to mention that Neil LaBute did a bad job with the directing and the screen writing, but the way he handles the unintentional funny stuff, priceless.If you decide to watch this remake of the original 1970's movie, then don't watch it expecting it to be a scary movie, as it is anything but that. Instead, when you watch it, you should be expecting to see it as something along the lines of an unintentional comedy. On a scale from one to ten with one being the absolute worst and ten being the absolute best, I'll give this movie a rating of five stars. That rating means that this movie is half and half, it gets no stars for being a horror movie, but it gets five stars for being an unintentional comedy. So if you do decide to give this movie ago, then all I can say is this: be prepared to laugh, because the way that most of the scenes are handled is so overdone, that you won't find them scary or frightening, you will find them laughable.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ham sandwich with extra cheese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This updated Wicker Man is mostly entertaining misguided nonsense for a good portion of its running time, before going completely off the rails by the finale. Nic Cage goes to a small mysterious island in search of a missing girl, where some truly ham fisted plotting and dialogue play out as this island of mostly women give him the runaround. Leelee Sobieski is introduced as she sinisterly bites into an apple and that's about as nuanced and subtle as any performances get here. There's plenty of laughs with some truly bizarre plot detours and Nic Cage loosing his cool with these women. Neil LaBute is an odd choice to write and direct this material and the results are insanely loopy. The last act ups the bizarre and truly is a sight to behold. From the absurd image of a woman sitting in a room wearing a beard of bees, to Ellen Burstyn prancing about with half her face painted blue, The Wicker Man turns into a show stopping display of incompetent filmmaking and camp. The truncated theatrical version omits the now famous "not the bees!" bit and a quick scene of torture that certainly gets some laughs, but has a tacked on ending 'six months later' that is thankfully deleted in the extended version. No film with Cage dressed in a bear costume kicking the crap out of a bunch of crazed women should be considered a film with no merit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't make the mistake of confusing this 2006 remake with the original 1973 version, which is excellent -- as a horror movie, that is, since neither film shows much understanding of actual paganism, ancient or modern. (For those who don't know, the plot of both film's is about the horrifying fate of an investigator who stumbles on to a pagan cult community on a remote island.) This 2006 Nicolas Cage/Ellen Burstyn remake is only notable as one of the worst major films ever made. It wasn't so bad that it was unwatchable, and the film-making was adequately professional, but that's about all that can be said for it. Some gory scenes make it unsuitable for children, but basically it doesn't even succeed in being very scary. The Warner Home Video DVD is of OK quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I discovered that Nicolas Cage was the star of this remake I didn't hold out too much hope.(By the way,what's happened to his teeth? He's developed a speech Impediment and should demand a refund from his dental surgeon)! This pathetic load of boring garbage Is an Insult to the unique,strange,scary and deep original. I would urge anyone to see the original version first - try to get the uncut one - and then compare the two. Of course,there IS no comparison In reality.....this Is a pathetic and very weak 'version' and,even If I'd not seen the original,I don't think I'd have changed my vote.As for the budget of ?40,000,000,where did It go?On what was this huge sum spent? Like the ?63,000,000 spent on the 'thrilling'(NOT!)World trade centre,one can only assume that most of It went Into the pocket of Mr.Nicolas Kim Coppola(erm,sorry,I mean Mr.Nicolas Cage!) Avoid at all costs - It's a waste of time and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the original 70's Wickerman and If you've just seen this and decided that its absolute crap and you wouldn't bother watching the original, don't! The original Wickerman is a brilliant film, they should have just left it as it was instead of remaking it. I'm usually easily pleased when it comes to film, but this was just stupid! Maybe it was because the original was so good that it made this seem worse, I didn't enjoy it anyway. Watch both and compare, Nicholas Cage isn't a terrible actor, but he was rubbish in this. I don't get the whole women thing either. And why was Willow so boring? The original Willow was awesome! Her dancing and singing naked was one of the best bits of the film, and this remake has completely destroyed her character! Watch the original!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Take: Unintentionally laughable when not ridiculously boring.With a silly script and an over-the-top performance from Nicolas Cage, I was actually interested to see Niel LaBute's update of THE WICKER MAN, even if I knew I was gonna laugh at the whole affair. True enough, the scene with Nic Cage's character repeatedly yells "How'd it get burned!" cracked me up, but then I also forgot one other thing everyone hated about the movie: It was tedious.THE WICKER MAN might have been an unintentional comedy, but seeing that the film was supposed to be scary and taken seriously, the film is still slow and tedious, with not an ounce of scares or tension. The original material it was based on (which was also adapted into a popular 1973 film) was interesting and completely original. This 2006 adaptation is just ludicrous, laughable even with Cage giving the most over-the-top performance of his career as Edward Malus, a detective sent on the lonely island of Summersisle, which thrives upon harvesting honey and ruled upon by Queen bee-like Sister Summerslsle (Ellen Burstyn). He's in search of his daughter from his ex-wife (Kate Beahan) who has gone missing, and discovers something deeper behind it all. What is it? That this film was intended as a comedy.Unless you can stand much of the film's running time to see Nic Cage at the edge of losing his career to a scene where he runs around in a bear suit, THE WICKER MAN is a remake that proves that all is well when you leave well enough alone.Rating: *1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pathetic Excuse for a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me tell you something right now. "The Wicker Man" is by far the worst film I have ever seen. Despite the fact that Nicholas Cage gives a brilliant performance in the lead role the movie is still awful. The movies sets itself up to be a good thriller but falls way too short.There are several interesting elements to the film that could have turned it into something good but it doesn't. The story doesn't really have any sense of direction. The plot is consistent until the vary end where a twist seems to be pulled out from nowhere. When this twist happens you feel as if though you have been abandoned from all means of good story telling. "The Wicker Man" is a pathetic excuse of a movie and deserves never to be watched again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to the video store to rent this and took the DVD box to the front counter, the girl behind the counter told me, "I think I should warn you - this is a terrible movie." I told her that I had heard that, but that I had heard that Nicholas Cage gave an unintentionally funny performance. Another reason why I decided to rent it was that it was a Millennium Pictures movie, and their movies at the very least have high production values. But I told the girl that I would prepare myself for the worst.She was right.In fairness to the movie, it does look good. The island scenery looks nice, and you do feel like the characters are stuck on a remote island. Also... uh... ah... that's about all I can think of that's genuinely positive about this movie.The biggest sins the movie makes is that it is both slow and dumb. There are absolutely no surprises in the movie. Even if you haven't seen the original "Wicker Man", you'll be able to guess the so-called twists the movie throws forth. Cage's character is incredibly dumb; he can't figure out (unlike us) who the father is of the missing girl he's seeking. It's frustrating seeing his investigation, and what makes it worse is that Cage's performance at times is pretty bad. Oh, sometimes I laughed at his shouting, and there is the occasional other unintentional humorous moment (like the bear suit scene). But overall this movie is a chore to sit through.</fullReview>

Looks like neither because lines like "How did it get burned ? HOW DID IT GET BURNED ?!?!??!?!?" and don't forget the infamous "Get off the bike". This is easily one of the worst remakes ever but if you want to have a laugh with somebody, i suggest you get this movie.

		<fullReview>It needs it for this one, I think a 1 out of 10 is too generous. This movie is now ancient, so no one will read through the ample list of bashing comments, but sometimes it is true that a movie is so bad that one just *HAS* to spit out one's feelings.I remember watching the original, and you have to love Edward Woodward. Nicky Cage, as it's been said, can either play a very convincing drunk or loser or nutjob, but other stuff where's he's supposed to act like a normal one of "us", is not his forte.OK, a couple of minor points:I'll admit I didn't watch the beginning of this. It came by on HBO when I was channeling surfing, and I could not convince my wife not to turn the channel; she likes Cage for some reason. (maybe the new hair?) So I missed all the set-ups on why he came to the island with the dead girl flashbacks. I can tell you this: while it may be a good plot element to help flesh out a complex character (not him in this movie, regardless) they way overdid them in the parts that I saw, and when they dropped them into the plot seemed to make no sense.I had to watch the end to see if he was going to make some miracle escape. It almost had me rooting for him and could have paved the way for an even more ridiculous ending than the "6 mo. later" that they used. (yawn, and obvious, too. I can't believe the comments of someone who said they didn't get it???) I guess thats what punching out a broad with a bear suit on will do to you. (femminists flame on)Ellen just annoyed me. When he found out at the end he had no bullets in his gun, I would have just charged her and strangled her with my bare hands. Isn't that what cops are supposed to do?I also think killing the "queen" would have maybe knocked the wind out of the hive? Or possibly not, don't bees just "create" a new queen when theirs dies?The main point is: what kind of idiot cop does not check his weapon, at least to see how many rounds are in it? Do you have to assume Mr. Director, that I'm that stupid? Obviously, the answer is yes.Come On, at least overpower your ex-girlfriend when she shows you the bullets in her hand! You could have knocked them down and at least grabbed one of them and ran. Then you could have just put the gun up to your head and saved the lovely ending that you got.His ruining of the final scenes (not that they pretty much weren't *ALL* ruined) by the stupid yelling. "...Ow, my legs!, Ow, Ow, Ow!!!..." just continued to detract from any salvageable horror you might have mustered when you find out that it's him, and not the girl to be sacrificed, and he's been horribly (OK, not really for any thinking person) duped. That's what good horror movies often end with: a horrible realization that always comes too late.....And please, do you have to laugh or not when the girl comes forward with the torch and he's yelling to her "..please don't honey, daddy says that's bad, etc, etc) I'm still chuckling at that inane naiveté.And they were dragging him up by the feet (must have hurt, with the supposedly broken legs), which is where I would have left him. At the end, just break out, dammit, it's only f_ckin' wicker! His arms didn't look broken to me. Just spread open the damn wicker bars. Sure, you'd fall to your death probably, but that would have been a tad more merciful that what happened to you. And you'd have screwed up the pagan witches' plan a wee bit. I know you couldn't run away; I still say you could have made a solid break for it when you realized the gun was empty, or at least taken out Burnstyn and a couple of the others. When you've (finally) reached the conclusion that these people of capable of sacrificing a little girl, then you realize that it's really going to be you, one should pull out all the stops immediately, and not wait for them to grab you. At least bring some of them down with you. He also could have spit into her face, instead of bawling.</fullReview>

I am quite sure "ever" isn't long enough. Not scary. Not funny. Not well acted. It was like "Return to Eden" meets "Children of the Corn" meets "Wonder Woman." Horrible. If I never hear the word "Rowan" again it will be too soon. He must have said the little girls name about 700x in a row. Ellen Burstyn was so great in "Requiem for a Dream" that I wonder how she even entertained taking this script. Maybe it was a favor.

This film fits the theme, as the "hero" sucker punches an older lady who is not threatening him.Dumb, awkward, misogynist story. Great cast given comically bad lines to say. Also demonizes people whose religious beliefs are different than one's own, but we can thank the (far superior) source material for that.I hope that by puking this stuff up onto the screen--with his hero carried off screaming "Bitches!

		<shortDescription>Disappointing and unspectacular remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wicker Man" is an incredibly flawed and uninspiring remake.**SPOILERS**Haunted by a tragic accident, Detective Edward Malus, (Nicholas Cage) leaves the police force to comprehend the tragedy. Sent a letter by his ex Willow Woodward, (Kate Beahan) she claims her daughter Rowan, (Erika-Shaye Gair) is missing and asks him to come investigate. Arriving on the isolated Summers Isle, the habitants' strange rituals and ceremonies start to infuriate him. Not getting anywhere in the investigation, as every lead turns out false, he begins to get more irritated and tries harder than ever to solve the case. After finally finding a real clue, he sets off and manages to see what the real reason was for the ceremony, which haunts him to his very soul.The Good News: This gets very little right. One of them is that the opening really works for the film. The everyday normality it opens to is expertly shattered with a brutal and shocking crash, and the eventual race before the fire burns everything is handled with some nice amounts of suspense. This has a really good tendency to stick to quick shots of whatever to derive it's scares, and several work. Opening a room where one is covered with bees or looking down to discover a dead victim are such examples of this. The search at times can be quite fun, as there's some really good scenes in here that are derived from that. It gets considerably more so towards the end, and especially after the sequence where he gets stuck in the underground cavern. That is a nicely suspenseful scene, and along with the others, constitutes the film's only good points.The Bad News: This has a few considerable flaws going for it. One of them is that there's way too much insistence on the aforementioned jump cuts. There's a large amount of them, and while some work for their visual impact or shock effect, they're at most really a distraction. There's so many that it can become blasé after a point. It can become deadening if there's too many of them, which this one has. There's even a problem with the way the investigation is handled. At the very end, he starts going around and throwing his weight around to make up for all the lies that were told to him. This really seems like an act which should've been done sooner, especially after the reception received. It might've worked better and had better results if done somewhat sooner. Another pretty big flaw is that there's no real surprises to be had from this. It plays out exactly as it originally did, and all the surprises and fun to be had from that one are gone because it is so familiar. Even the plot twist doesn't surprise, which is the greatest flaw in the film. This is built up to a twist that has none of the fear and dread that it featured in the original, and since there's a lot of talk about what's going to happen before it gets there, it effectively ruins all the momentum it would've had going into it the same. Even the tagged-on epilogue is a failure, as the movie should've ended with the twist rather than the lame gag given here. These here all keep the film down considerably.The Final Verdict: While not a complete waste of time, this one isn't that spectacular and doesn't even come close to the iconic original. That leaves this one mainly for those who tend to enjoy these harmless remakes only, while hardcore horror fans are urged to use extreme caution with it.Rated PG-13: Language and Violence</fullReview>

I regret not watching this movie earlier, it was superior to the original and Cage did a fine job.Both movies had extremely horrific endings and the humor was a way for the audience to swallow the bitterness of the end. I believe many in the American audience misunderstood the black comedy of this film and gave low ratings.The funniest part of the film was Cage being a motorcycle traffic cop and coming to the island as a detective. Seems most of the humor was based upon a knowledge of the original Wickerman.Well worth watching, don't believe the negative reviews on here.

		<shortDescription>A wasted opportunity...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Hardy's 1973 cult film, "The Wicker Man", is definitely one of the most interesting films ever made, and one of the best horror movies in cinema history. Written by Anthony Shaffer, it is a film that through a thrilling story of mystery and suspense, raised interesting questions about faith, philosophy and human psychology. The clashes between extreme ideologies and its disastrous consequences were the main theme of the film, and its eerie atmosphere, ambiguous subject and original score turned the movie into a revered cult classic. To remake a movie like "The Wicker Man" is definitely not an easy task, but certainly a very interesting project to make, as the source offered countless possibilities to explore. Director and writer Neil LaBute, famed for the interesting takes on human nature he makes in his films and plays, seemed like an ideal choice to make a reinvention of a classic, but sadly, I must say that this project ended up as another wasted opportunity.In this version, Edward Malus (Nicholas Cage) is a Californian patrolman taking some days off as he is recovering from the shock of a tragic accident on the road. While recovering, Malus receives a letter from his former fianceé Willow (Kate Beahan), telling him that her daughter has disappeared and asking him for help. Confused about the fact that Willow has contacted him after she left him many years ago, Malus decides to travel to the private island of Summersisle, where Willow lives now as a member of a community dedicated to the production of honey. In the island, Malus starts the investigations, but the population is suspiciously very uncooperative and of a very strange behavior. Soon Edward discovers that Rowan is kept hidden in the island and that there is something bigger going on in Summersile.Neil LaBute's take on the original is certainly a bold spin on the themes: instead of religion being the main theme, LaBute makes extreme sexism the focus of the movie. Under this theme, Summersile is now a matriarchy where females rule and males are oppressed, and the film's "hero" is an unbalanced man with a deep disdain for females. In all fairness, it is an interesting and ambitious spin, and it's clear that LaBute really understood that "The Wicker Man" was more than the tale of a missing kid; however, he fails to develop this subtext through the story and ends up with a very weak background to the core plot, leaving his "Wicker Man" as just another typical thriller. While on previous occasions LaBute has successfully pulled off interesting takes on the many forms of sexism, his work on "The Wicker Man" feels really weak, and ultimately disappointing.Unlike his writing, his direction of the movie is effective and during the first part of the movie, almost matches the original in terms of atmospheric horror and overall eeriness. Sadly, it takes an enormous effort to transform a lousy script into a good movie, and LaBute simply can't make it this time. While the movie moves at a nice pace and has some very good cinematography, the problems of the script become quickly too apparent and by the second half the movie becomes a series of well-directed scenes that have not logic or serve no purpose. LaBute is a good director, but the badly developed script finally damages the whole movie and good talent gets wasted with lousy dialogs and silly situations. Nicholas Cage's performance as Edward Malus is probably one of the worst roles of his career, and not really because his performance is completely bad, but because the character is horribly written. Ellen Burstyn is another wasted talent as Sister Summersile, the matriarch of the island and main "antagonist" of the film. Burstyn delivers her lines with dignity, but as Cage, can't do much to save a script doomed since its conception. Kate Beahan is definitely the worst actress of the cast, making her character look even worse than what it is (an accomplishment in itself, as Willow is one of the worst written ones). Leelee Sobieski appears in a completely unnecessary (and underused) role and definitely only Molly Parker escapes untainted by the film.In the end, the debacle of "The Wicker Man" can be summarized in two words: bad script. LaBute's idea of using sexism as main theme is good and quite original, but he betrays the original's spirit (and in many ways LaBute's own ideas) by the oversimplification of the characters. While Sister Summersile becomes the embodiment of evil, officer Malus appears as a weak and naive man, taking out the whole clash of believes from the picture in favor of cheap sympathies for the character. This change proves to be a mistake as Malus victimization becomes a joke that in the end makes the whole finale feel utterly pointless. The many plot holes and silly lines of dialog are just the tip of the iceberg of a doomed screenplay.In the end, "The Wicker Man" is a horrible disappointment, not only to fans of the original, but also to fans of Neil LaBute, as the movie is nowhere near his previous success and feels as a cheap made for TV thriller. I'm not against remakes, as I like to see different versions of a story, but this update to "The Wicker Man" is a movie to be left forgotten as soon as possible. True, it's good looking trash, but trash after all. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie is not all that horrible.. it's the last 15 minutes that's obnoxious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched the movie after reading all these reviews and it's not as bad as so many people are saying it is. The movie was pretty good until the last 15 minutes or so. It was weird, interesting and also had me on the edge of my seat because, I had no idea (along with the main character) what was going on sometimes because that is the nature of the story. OK... the ending sure seemed like they cut a lot of corners in the story telling and the finale leaves a bitter taste for antagonists in the story.It didn't make any statements about Pagans or religion for that matter in my opinion, but did involve a matriarchial cult (meaning made up of women). It was entertaining and I think falls into the psychological thriller genre, that left me sitting in my seat... dumbfounded at the end and saying to myself... "These women are really evil." and "why do I now fear islands near Washington state?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, what to say...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a movie critic, don't pupport to be and don't aspire to be. However, what i will say is i like movies, REAL movies, with real stories, real plot-lines, and real actors. The original Wicker Man is all of these things. Any remake of an original classic, possibly 'cult' film will never EVER come close to capturing the feeling of the first and best original. Why does Hollywood feel the need to to try and recapture something which cannot possibly be re-captured? Easy money? Riding on the back of previous winners? Who knows. All i know is, leave the originals alone. Promote them, re-release them, whatever. Just never, EVER re-make them. True movie lovers who know and appreciate the originals will scythe you down. And the general movie-going public will listen to what the seasoned film lover says. And even if they don't, they have eyes. If they liked or dis-liked the re-make, they will search out the original and be astounded at how wrong film-makers now-adays can ruin what is a truly awesome film (and I'm generalising, not talking about this film in particular.) Hope this helps? :o)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So......terrible. But God help me it was funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is horrible, the sexism on the island is unbelievable, the story makes no sense whatsoever and this is supposed to be a horror movie, right? Well it's not, it's actually a comedy starring the king of overacting "Nicolas Cage" as our main character Edward. The film also stars Kate Beahan as Cage's old flame and Ellen Burstyn as The Lady who runs the island of Honey and Feminism (as I call it.) The plot revolves around Cage, who is called to an island to search for a missing girl who is Cage's and Willow (Crackhead's) daughter. Kate Beahan is awful as hell in this movie, I swear every time she forgets her lines and never finishes her sentences. Nic Cage is himself in this with multiple bizarre scenes of overacting yet no eye-bulging. The Feminist island has an elaborate and very stupid plan to sacrifice Cage to bring back their honey crop (whoopty do). If that's the case, why'd they try to kill him before the sacrifice? There are plenty of recurring dreams for Cage but it's irrelevant to the plot, making a lot of it pointless. The movie itself is a joke, it's terribly written beyond belief, the characters are morons but it's funny as hell. If you need a bad movie for a good laugh, check this movie out. Just don't expect to be engaged in horror story. All hail Cage the Bear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Freaking Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Literally.... Culturally...Terribly....Completely, the worst movie i have ever seen. Absolutely terrible. Never watch this, unless if maybe your high or something. Which even in that case i doubt you will enjoy it. This is the kind of movie that you buy for someone who you want to commit suicide. The worst ending in history. It starts out as a kind of decent suspenseful horror movie that builds up a weird kind of tension based on the fact that the community in this movie is absolutely bizarre in every way you never want to see. Nicolas Cage's acting is absolutely despicable and irritating. The movie just digresses further and further into a pile of ashes while you are learning more and more weird and disturbing things about the people on the island, until you do not even care what happens, you do not care about anything, and the only part of the movie that has your disgusted attention in the latter half of the movie is the ending, Which is the kind of material that makes you want to jump off a bridge and live with the fishes. I can't go into detail since i don't want to spoil this terrible movie for you, But i'm just warning you, It is inevitable that anyone will be completely disappointed when they see this movie for the first time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh no not The Wicker Man!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon my unfortunate viewing of this abomination known as "The Wicker Man," It had been foretold, at least in my perspective, that this was a film of great unintentional humor; the kind of film that one partakes in laughing their jolly mouths off at the utter ridiculousness of the movie. However after seeing this trash known as "The Wicker Man" I recall my reaction to the film to be most horrified. This wretchedness might be the worst film I have ever seen in my life, and I shall tell you why.Firstly the writing in this flick is some of the most pointless and appalling dialogue I ever heard. There are many examples of useless dialogue exchanged from character to character, and yet it never is related to the story material at hand. Plus, along with the dialogue, there are multiple scenes in the film that NEVER serve any purpose to the story whatsoever. For instance at the beginning while Cage is patrolling on his motorcycle, he retrieves a doll to a family who is moving out of state. While he carries on to return the doll, a big rig literally drives through the car where the family is parked and kills them, just like that, and yet there is no mentioning of the incident again! Now you could make the argument that the wreck later haunted his dreams throughout the film, but why did it have to be a wreck, and couldn't his fear for his missing daughter be a better nightmare fuel? To say that there is a great immense of under acting in his role is an understatement. Nicolas Cage is CLEARLY winging this thing like its a huge pile of nothing (can't blame him.) Plus it does not help that his character has, well, NO CHARACTER! In fact every role in this film is under developed and under acted, which leads to a band of misfits that you care less about than a Facebook update about your sister's "girls night out." But most importantly the film is the very definition of jumbled. It seems like the film is trying to portray it's story, but it chooses pointless and out-of-context scenes to do so. The entire structure is deeply flawed. In conclusion, The Wicker Man is a dreadfully disarranged film of a story that takes us nowhere, acting that makes the mortuary service at Ben Stein's funeral look exciting, and a terribly misguided directorial job that could not simply handle the material at hand. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! See Full Review at theoguyproductions at BlogSpot</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"How did it get produced? How did it get produced!!1?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You probably know "The Wicker Man" remake, even if you haven't seen it completely. After all, this is the age of the internet, where every so-called "fail" makes it to Youtube ? and few films have failed harder than "The Wicker Man".We don't know what led director Neil LaBute to the realization that he was the man to remake one of the most iconic horror-films of all times. However, I'm tempted to believe that he must have been pondering the options to remake either "The Wicker Man" or "The Rocky Horror Picture Show". Possibly consuming a ham-sandwich at this time, he opted to cast Nicolas Cage as protagonist either which way. Or maybe he flipped a coin, imagining Cate Blanchett as Riff Raff, in case the decision fell on RHPC (which would have been produced without a soundtrack, by the way). But the coin fell on "The Wicker Man" side.So he went on to produce "The Wicker Man", took out all the elements that made the original brilliant, instead filling it with putrid acting, one of the most improbable storyline in cinema's history and plenty (unintentional) humor."The Wicker Man" would have deserved to become a flop and an obscure footnote in cinema history. However, the gods of cinema must have been as little amused as the fans and bestowed a fate much worst on the remake. It became a cinematic joke: a testament to the inability of a director and evidence that Cage had spent all his talent in "Leaving Las Vegas", all that's left of him being an empty, grimacing shell of an actor. Like John Tavolta's "Battlefield Earth" and the latest works of M. Night Shyamalan, it became an epitome of fail and the butt of jokes on many mocking, fan-made Youtube-videos.Sure I recommend that people and especially the fans of the one-and-only "Wicker Man" watch this train-wreck of a movie. Watch it and have a good laugh at the expense of everybody involved. Make it a "Rocky Horror Picture Show"-like event and when Cage holds up a charred dolls to the screen, screeching "how did it get burned?", reply whole-heartedly: "With fire!!!" It get's the same number of points that a remake of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" as supernatural thriller, featuring Nicolas Cage as Frank N. Furter (and without music) would have gotten ? plus the mandatory point from IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible remake of a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm probably not saying anything new here that somebody already hasn't said in a review but I just got done watching this and the only reason being was to see how bad it actually was. First major gripe I had with it was the writing and the dialogue are awful. The writers didn't think a lot through. There were so many loose ends and things that went unexplained. They were just waiting for their next paycheck. Second gripe I had with it was that the acting is terrible. I've never been much of a Cage fan and the rest of the cast weren't any better either. A good rule of thumb I go by is that if you can tell they are acting they aren't doing a good job. Good actors sell their roles and convince you. Needless to say I wasn't convinced. I'm not a very harsh critic and if a movie entertains me it did its job but when a movie is this blatantly bad it can make anybody a harsh critic. Overall, a poor movie. Just don't see it. Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a bad film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this recently with my girlfriend for a laugh. Its bad. Really bad. In the trailer you see a child being hit by a truck. This is in the film for about 20 minutes then completely forgot about! The film has SO many unneeded scenes and so many loose ends. I will say the ending is actually not bad though stupid and careless. Also for anyone who's watched it (not a spoiler) he looses his "Everythings OK" Cd's in the film he makes an effort to find it then never questions his belongings being tampered with. I really wanna know where his CD is! Id say give it a watch its quite funny to mock. Id like to see remake of this film because the story is strong just cut the loose ends and get better actors! Mr. Cage although i liked you in "National Treasure" i do not like you as an actor your acting is somewhat boring and i just cant actually see you in the part of anything. What i mean is you look like a man with a family a dog and i lovely wife not some cop who goes looking for some girl who's missing. Im not sure if anyone else agrees but my girlfriend also made this point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stay away from this island</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take a horror classic from the early 1970s starring the wonderful Christopher Lee,remake it as a vehicle for the largely wooden Nic Cage, and you have 2006's WICKER MAN. While the remake follows the original's plot, it is missing any suspense and consists mostly of Cage as a cop frantically chasing and biking around a mysterious island where he believes his daughter is being held captive. The islanders are nature-worshiping pagans, so we know where this is going.It's the same plot as Shirley Jackson's THE LOTTERY, which has been filmed under various titles over the years.Cage is awful, and Ellen Burstyn as the head of the pagans is a long way from her role as the mom in THE EXORCIST.In fact, she gets to deliver the worst dialog in the movie. The film is downright laughable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laughable but not always</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK first off watch the original, the acting is far better and so is the storyline. Anyway onto the review I watched this film once alone and never again. Nicolas Cage is awful in this, he has two emotions throughout the entire film; dull and angry. He mumbles his lines most of the time (except when he's shouting) so it's kinda hard to tell what he's saying though that may not be a bad thing. They've messed with the storyline a bit though I don't know why. In the beginning SPOILERS he sees a woman and her daughter die in a car crash (he's a policeman who pulls them over, the girl throws her doll he goes to get it and they are hit by a truck) he is then comforted by his friend a female officer. I bring this up because apparently all three of them are in on the plan to get him to the island (the girl and the mother didn't die) what part they played I couldn't tell and this twist just really really complicated things. In the films defence there were some laugh out loud moments, unintentional though they were, just saying how'd it get burned causes me and my friends to burst out laughing. However there aren't enough so- bad-it's-funny moments to save the film. My advice; watch the film with some friends, having other people laugh with you always makes a film more enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so bad....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, to Murraydeschot of the Netherlands - the island was off of the coast of Washington State, which is also consistent with the cult's trek to the west! Try not to compare remakes with the original as they are inevitably panned as they are not exactly the same!Overall, I found the film OK. I haven't seen the original British version, so I can't compare them. The plan (or plot) as it was stated, required quite a few coincidental events. If Edward had reacted differently, things wouldn't have worked out....- He never left a message with anyone about where he was going. - He could have rented a boat to get to the island. - When he went to rescue (or so he thought) Rowan, he never checked his weapon and was surprised when it didn't fire! - There was fishing gear -- including lobster traps -- on the dock. There was probably a boat around somewhere. Once he realised how weird everything was, he should have looked for a boat to get off the island and find help.It would have been interesting if they had explored the cult a bit more and it's connection to Salem to flesh out the story. The self-proclaimed pagans who commented on this film shouldn't fear as I do not believe anyone would seriously believe they are burning people in giant wicker structures.I preferred the alternate ending where you get to see his legs broken. The way the mallet crunched those femurs was cringe worthy. Although, I'm pretty sure he would have lost consciousness from bleeding out in his thighs from the fractures!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite possibly the worst remake ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was my intention to review this title as an independent film and avoid mentioning the original. It's impossible, because much of the mental and physical pain this movie causes somehow traces back to the fact that it's supposed to be a "remake".Remakes are usually not a very good idea in general. You really need to have a new perspective on the story to justify a remake. If you bring something new to the table while holding true to the original version, then you've succeeded, whether or not the quality of your work compares to the original.The world and story of the original Wicker Man were so well thought of that virtually no logical inconsistencies remain in the movie. The world view and the way of thinking of a heathen culture and their collision with the Christian values is plausibly depicted from the beginning to the end, and in the end no questions remain. All the characters and their motives are treated with equal consideration and respect. The end result is as much a study on religion in general as it is a movie. There are several perspectives to choose from, and whichever you choose, you can still relate to the movie and agree that it's a fine piece of work.To bring something new to that is a gigantic task and should only be attempted after a very critical evaluation of the idea you have for the remake. But here, there is no perspective whatsoever. There's just a horrible mishmash of poorly executed direct loans from the original, and erratic changes for whatever god awful reason. Honestly, I don't have a clue what they were thinking. It's like they threw away the consideration, consistency and plausibility of the original, made an 8-year old rewrite the script and brought in Nicholas Cage to punch (and kick) women in the face.Now, I wholeheartedly agree that violence towards women can be an element in a film, but just like any other form of violence, it needs to make sense from the viewpoint of the story. The character doing it needs to have a reason for behaving violently, and we the viewers need to know what that reason is. Nicholas Cage delivers the punches, but he doesn't deliver the reasons for them, or any other sort of emotion for that matter. When his character finds out that he is in fact a father and his daughter is in grave danger, he reacts as if someone just told him that the price of a beer just went up by 5 cents in the bar around the corner. Tommy Wiseau's performance in "The Room" is more vivid and plausible. I'm 100% serious about this.Everything that's remotely good about this sorry excuse of a "remake" comes straight from the original, and even that means individual lines of dialogue and not much more. Every single change that has been made is disastrous or worse. The soul and spirit of the original movie has been brutalized, and they still dare call this a remake.If I had never ever even heard that the original existed, I might, just might have given this 2/10, because then I would've been fooled into thinking that they had a pretty original idea that they just miserably failed to execute. The acting is horrible, the directing is horrible, the production is horrible, everything about this movie is horrible and appalling and will haunt me to my grave and beyond. Avoid like the plague.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For those not familiar with the 1973 original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're someone not familiar with the 1973 original film and might be interested in seeing it as a stand alone feature, then I'd best tell you, you will be disappointed either way, because I decided to do so since I only read comments comparing it to the original and I am also not familiar with it.To start off, the film with its elements, does absolutely nothing, it does nothing to build any kind of tension or suspense, it has this orchestra type soundtrack that just sounds a collection of classical tunes which also does nothing to help the film build any tension etc. and the acting is very much what you would expect from a B movie, which in a lot of ways it made me think of this as B movie featuring Nicolas Cage, the storyline itself has big enough holes to build tunnels in them.From another standpoint the film seems like a waste, I don't just mean that its total crap, I am referring to the fact that director Neil LaBute had so much footage cut from it in order to secure a PG-13 rating, (a lot of it are not even featured in the unrated version) you have this large amount of footage that wasn't going to be used in the film and no one is ever going see them, what was the point of shooting the film to begin with? Sure aim for a broader audience but you still have all that unused footage and what about the time spent shooting all that footage? If you reckon you want a film to have a PG-13 rating, then make the film to suit the standards needed, don't turn it into sushi.</fullReview>

It is reflected in this film a lot if I closed my eyes i could easily believe that I was watching National Treasure 2. His actor screaming is also incredibly off putting and made me want to laugh.I really thought that the idea of the film was good hence why I have gave it 3 stars. I especially liked how the women scared the men with there brains insead of violence.I didn't want it to end when it did either I really thought the complete opposite would have happened.Great twist at the ending!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of 2006's Biggest Disappointments; Could Have Been Much Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people were disappointed with this movie who hadn't actually seen the original film. After all, you have an otherwise good director, Neil Labute, who made other brilliant films such as "Nurse Betty" and "Your Friends and Neighbors", and you had Academy Award winners Nicholas Cage and Ellen Burstyn. Plus, Burstyn was brilliant in the best horror film of all time, "The Exorcist" (1973). With this impressive roster of talent (and that's not even the whole list), this remake should have been really good.For people who had seen the original movie, like me, this remake came as an even larger disappointment. After all, the original 1973 film was a brilliant movie. The reason it was so scary was because there could easily have been a separate island like Summerisle in real life, and human sacrifices could, and probably do, still take place in some countries. However, if the original movie had weaknesses, it was in the surprising number of plot holes that could have been explained but weren't. Going into this movie, I thought if the American remake would do anything right, it would at least patch up some of those plot holes.Needless to say, for every plot hole the American remake tried to cover up, at least two more opened up in the form of faulty logic and further unexplained events. For instance, why were there twins on the island? And if there was no electricity on the island, how did Summerisle have their own web page? Why didn't the male inhabitants ever talk? And last but not least, what was the significance of the car crash in the beginning of the film which supposedly cost the life of the jaded girl in the car? Those are just a few of the events that remained unexplained even after the film's conclusion.Additionally, Nicholas Cage's character didn't seem to be very logical himself. In a failed attempt to make this film into a suspense/action thriller, they had him do stupid things like diving into water to retrieve a body that's obviously dead, or wandering into a dark barn when he thinks he heard someone wandering around. Cage's character lacks both healthy fear and common sense, and it makes this film unintentionally campy.Without giving too much away, the ending was surprisingly disappointing as well. All I will say is that it ended in a similar fashion to the original, which is good because I initially thought it would have a happy, cop-out ending. But the #1 thing that made the original Wicker Man ending scary was absolutely ignored in this movie. The original ending to the 1973 movie was made scarier because of the townspeople's reaction to the Wicker Man burning. In this movie, they seem far more jaded, and the scary effect doesn't work at all.In fact, this movie was so flawed, that when I went to see it opening weekend at the movie theater, the audience was laughing all the way through it. It's unfortunate too, because you can't take this movie seriously when Cage punches a woman in the face, then steals her bear suit. This movie has proved itself to be more unintentionally funny than "Mommie Dearest".This version of "The Wicker Man" could have been a whole lot better in so many ways. It's unfortunate too, because I really like Nicholas Cage. If you don't want to be too disappointed, see the original "Wicker Man" first. The plus side to this movie coming out is that the original is no longer so hard to find on DVD. Now you can find that version in most stores. As for this version, well, I think most of the people involved in making this film know how much better they could have done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nic Cage comedies rule</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was pretty much a horrible film, but that is neither here nor there. This movie demands to be watched for having some of the most earnest, unintentional, hilarious comedy I have ever seen. I can only assume the jokes were unintentional, but whatever the case I was rolling. Allow me to share some highlights.- Nic Cage, at home, disturbed, moody and medicated, gets a mysterious letter from his ex written with some amazing calligraphy. And then a phone call. He answers "Hello?" but there is silence...and then...and then...wait for it...dial tone! Nic lunges away from the phone as though the devil himself were giving him a wet willy. Lord, that dial tone is frightening.- Nic discovers a burnt doll in a grave. But...how'd it get burned? How'd it get burned? How'ditgetburned? HOW'DITGETBURNED?!?!?!?!?! -Desperately searching for Ellen Burstyn, Nic Cage ransacks her home. As you might expect of Ellen Burstyn, she has a room where a one eyed old man covered in creepy bumps and bee stings sits shirtless in a bed.-But wait! It's not just one eyed old men. It's naked girls covered in bees. For some reason.-Dressed in a full body bear costume, Nicolas Cage (filmed in a nice long shot) runs straight up a hill while the entire population of the island watches, and punches out some random woman. And he's dressed as a bear.- Fed up with the island's insanity, and fresh from punching out a woman (not the aforementioned woman on a hill) Nic is attacked by Leelee Sobieski. After a brief scuffle, it becomes clear what Nic Cage must do. He must kung-fu kick her right into a wall.-The children of the island are little liars. You little liars. And your teacher is the biggest liar of all. And who the hell put a bird in that desk? Why would you do something sick like that???? -Killing Nicolas Cage will not bring back your goddamn honey harvest.-Nic Cage hates it when you smash his legs. Or whatever you do to them off screen. He hates is so bad he'll scream about it long and hard.-Man, there are a lot of beekeepers on this island.-When Nic Cage gets bored on a dock, then sees a body under the dock, he will channel the same kung-fu he uses to beat down Leelee Sobieski and do some manner of US Olympic gymnastics team flip right into the water.-Little girls chanting "phallic symbol phallic symbol" is so funny,even Nic Cage, possibly struggling to believe he's in this movie, will laugh at it.-For no reason that will ever be explained, upon arriving on the island, the first thing someone does is steal Nic Cage's self-help "Everything's OK" book on tape.-Nic Cage will steal your bicycle at gunpoint if he has to. So you better step away from the bike.-Nic Cage is not above screaming the word "bitches" repeatedly. Because he knows you'll get the message soon enough. Probably.In short, this movie is like a Mel Brook's production of old. This is comedy gold. Love it. Love it!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not against remakes, in fact I'd go as far to say that I thought the Dawn of the Dead remake is better than the original. If they'd have just stuck to the original story they may have done a bit better on this, but as it stands... well, inconsistent in pretty much everything.The characters are the worst part, and I'm going to blame the director on this as Nic Cage is a good actor, but there are scenes where he just completely changes his personalty without a seconds hesitation.The whole bee-sting allergy was just odd. The set up for it was ridiculous, Nic wonders through a large open expanse looking up into the sky for no apparent reason and bumps directly into a bee hive, but he's in the middle of 100's of hive. Oh noes !! Seriously, c'mon - he must have really been looking at the sky very intently to get into that situation.The female lead was also woeful - how can you not pick up on her suspicious behaviour or her paper-thin attempts at lying.Awful.. that said I saw the score on IMDb and wanted to watch it to see if it was that bad.

		<fullReview>Contains some spoilers. Be warned.My first review. This movie deserves a much higher score and I'm going to try and explain why. Hitchcock said something like "I like to scare people and while making them smile". That is exactly what this movie does. It has mysticism that builds up while also getting more and more comical and not in a slap-stick sort of way, but in a subtle, absurd one, which is my favorite kind of humor. It's not funny if you know it's for fun. If you feel the same way, you'll enjoy this movie.I just love "my god? Oh, my GOD!" when Cage is introduced to the wooden statue and "NOT THE BEES!" and all the slapping and the bear costume. That and the thick mystic atmosphere makes a lovely recipe of a movie if you ask me. A mixing of genres. It is not a thriller and it is not a comedy, it's something rare which is both engaging and comic.I've read some of the reviews here and would like to address the issue people tend to have on Cage's acting. I though it was superb. One must have in mind that his character is suffering from lots of trauma and medication and that it is a rare genre. Despite this I though his character was deep and dynamic, with lots of layers that might confuse people expecting a B-thriller and one-dimensional leads. I love the way he approaches Willow that I think every hurt/love-sick man can identify with. Lots of layers there. Impressive. One must also consider the fact that he is not a "good guy", but a just a man with issues and possibly quite anti-feminist.Don't have much to add to the other actors, but would like to point out that they are not bad actors, but are portraying complex characters and seen from Cage's perspective, whom himself is delusional and mentally ill and it all adds to the mysticism and they're all doing a good job.I think the problem many people have with this movie and its characters is that it enters an alien world with alien people in it. You need someone to cling on to and that would be Cage. Only problem is that he turns even worse than the others? I on the other hand like it and want to see more of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unnecessary remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original version of 'The Wicker Man' has become a cult classic but I don't think this remake has any chance of achieving such a status, gone is the constant sense than something is very wrong and in its place is a bunch of slightly strange women. Whereas Edward Woodward portrayed a devout police sergeant looking for a missing girl he is unconnected to Nicolas Cage plays a policeman who has received a letter from his former fiancée claiming that her daughter has gone missing making his task a personal matter.Before receiving the letter he is involved in a strange accident where he tries to rescue a young girl and her mother from a burning car; he fails but strangely no bodies are found. Once he hears from his ex he heads to the mysterious Summer's Isle in Puget Sound. Here he finds a less than warm welcome from the islands women and silence from the men. As he investigates everybody denies any knowledge of the missing girl but when he finds evidence of her existence he is told that she died. He starts to suspect that she was sacrificed as part of the island's harvest rituals but when he finds no body in her supposed grave he believes that she is still alive but being kept hidden for this years sacrifice. As the time of the ritual he searches everywhere for her and eventually finds her only to learn the terrifying truth about why he was invited to the island.I wouldn't say this was a terrible film; it passed the time well enough and I wasn't bored, unfortunately I didn't find it particularly scary either which is a bit of a weakness in a horror film. Nicolas Cage is a decent actor but his portrayal of the policeman wasn't a patch on Edward Woodward's. This may be down to the changes in the story that made the character far less innocent. There are some nice touches; I liked how Nicolas Cage's character was called Edward and is ex-fiancée's surname was Woodward in a nod to the star of the original and the 'stand away from the bicycle' scene earned a laugh.Overall I wouldn't recommend going out of ones way to see this but if it is on television it passes the time well enough and even provides some unintentional laughs. If you are thinking of buying 'The Wicker Man' on DVD I'd get the 1973 original though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rate this a 2 out of 10 because this movie in no way lived up to its promises of of thrills, scares, and intrigue. I've seen telly-tubby episodes that have been scarier than this movie. However, I'd rate it an 8-10 on my own personal favorite movie scale- whoever you are, I urge you to watch this movie- it will surely brighten your day. This movie took itself so seriously that the unintentional humor in it gave me stitches from laughing so hard. I had some friends watch it with me and they all swore that they never laughed so hard in their lives. From Cage's horrendous acting and classic lines like "how'd it get burned?!", this is true (though unintentional) comic genius. Watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes it's a bad movie, this review is focused on why</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't realize until reading one of the other viewer's reviews that this was a remake. Having said that, upon watching the movie, I immediately recognized that LaBute was striving for that 1970s genre that I enjoyed so much growing up. Other movies in this genre, that I grew up watching annually on TV, to give you an idea were THE PEOPLE, THE SPELL, AUDREY ROSE, THE REINCARNATION OF PETER PROUD, and there was one with Leonard Nimoy, BAFFLED! and another, the name escapes me about a woman in a new town, but she's having reoccurring dreams of having been tortured as a Salem witch.But the problem with Neil LaBute's THE WICKER MAN is all in the writing and editing.I don't agree with the other reviews about the acting. I have my master's in acting and I believe myself to be a pretty critical judge in that department. The acting only looked bad because of what they had to work with. But everyone was fine, everyone except the actress who played Willow. I thought she was very poor. And I was distracted by her lips which looked overly injected with collagen. However Nick Cage, Ellen Burstyn, Leelee Sobieski and the actresses who played Sisters Beech and Rose were all very good. They have no control over the words and the editing,--and the directing--and that's wherein the problem lies.I thought about the movie afterward and decided that the movie would have been fine if two actions had been done: 1. completely taken out the whole mother-daughter car scene in the beginning, and all the hallucinations with those characters throughout the movie.Between trying to figure out the meaning of the missing bodies in that car, and watching Nick Cage pop pills and seeing those people over and over in his present reality, AND relive the car scene over and over, I was sure that that experience and those characters were going to have to come back in the movie sometime, and they did not.and 2. fixed the choppy editing. One minute Nick Cage is running here, then he's running there, then he's under water, then he's running through Sister Summerisle's house, then after looking in two rooms he can't find her so he leaves, then he's marching with the group and he's wearing a bear suit, etc.Because of the choppiness of the editing I could only assume that this was in connection with the pills Cage's character is popping throughout the movie and it's got to turn out to be "this was all a hallucination" stirred on by the trauma the character went through having seen the girl burn up in the car and not being able to save her. I would have been disappointed, but at least it would have made the whole film cohesive.In addition, there were some other scenes that should have been cut because they were just confusing, such as Cage running into a room and seeing Sobieski covered in bees, and the scene when Cage sees a woman in the field and says, "Aren't you Sister Rose? Didn't I just speak with you?" and she says no. I didn't even think it was the same actress. And if it was, what the hell did that mean? This movie needed to be kept much more simple and systematic. Then, step by step we would have seen Cage's character, the "fly" if you will, being led and ultimately caught in the spider's web. We would not have understood what was happening until the end, but then at the end we would be able to look back on the whole thing and it would all make sense. The plot is complex enough. It would have shone through, if everything else in the film was kept simple.And if I were to substitute the beginning car inferno scene with something, it would have been some history and perhaps flashbacks of Cage's character with Willow, so that we had something to connect with when he travels all the way there to help her.Sometimes it is fun to see a badly made movie and pick it apart. If you agree, then go see THE WICKER MAN.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worth it, but not god-awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My friend Pat and I, after watching this film, had to sit in the theatre and figure out exactly what we hated about it. She: Nicholas Cage, everything else; me: the feeling that some significant elements were lost in translation from the original.OK, that wasn't ALL I hated, but I like to be specific.First, I didn't find the movie UNWATCHABLE. Watch it for free, and you will TOTALLY get your money's worth.The first HUGE thing I found annoying was - in the original, a police officer goes to a small insular island community on an anonymous tip that a small girl has gone missing. The town/island of Summerisle, however, is fairly NORMAL (normal for Scotland in the early 1970s, anyway). It has a pub. It has a castle. It doesn't get many visitors, or want many visitors, but it is pretty average, if a little behind the times. In the remake, the island/town is just plain WEIRD. Rather than "behind the times" or "hick-ish" it's practically Amish - well, OK, it looks like something from around 1900-1917 - and women are in charge, and men don't talk.The problem I had is this: "creepy things happening in a normal setting is MUCH MORE creepy". Once you're in a weird town, finding weird things seems normal. In a "regular" town, finding weird things is eerie. You wouldn't expect a drag queen in full showgirl regalia on the streets of Des Moines Iowa (apologies to any Iowan drag queens if I am wrong), but wouldn't look twice at one in Las Vegas.The second thing was belief. In the original, the Laird of Summerisle basically admitted (whether truthfully or not) to the cop that he himself didn't actually believe any of the old religion, it was just a way to keep his people happy. Which makes it MUCH MORE creepy that the Laird would condone, and in fact take part in, the final ritual. You may not agree with true believers, but at least you can figure they are passionate about what they do - an opportunist, however, that's creepy.OK, and the whole bee thing was weird - plus they didn't get it right. Males shouldn't have been working at all, since the only "bee males" are drones and don't do any work. Sigh.OH, and I think in the future I will stay away from any movie set in the San Juan islands which involves a church or church ruin. Apparently Summersisle is just across the channel from the Isla De Muerte (from House of the Dead). ...shuddder...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has the phrase "completely unnecessary" written all over it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1973 film for me while slightly missing out on the classic status was very effective and well done, very bizarre and disturbing when it needed to be and elevated by a brilliant Christopher Lee especially. Anyway that is enough, for I am not going to try comparing the film to this dross. Both this and the Psycho remakes were completely unnecessary and awful on their own terms, but if I had to edge out which was worse, Psycho but that is not saying much.This remake of The Wicker Man may be glossy, it may be expensive, but guess what? In my opinion, it was completely and utterly pointless as well. It was hilarious but for all the wrong reasons, whether it is the meaningless plot change about Nicolas Cage's character being allergic to bees or the finale, which was way overdone in the sense I couldn't stop laughing.The film certainly looks glossy and expensive, but that's the thing, they overdo it with the visuals as well so it all looks flashy with no sense of melancholy or menace underneath. And I can't count the number of scenes that were dumbed or dulled down, even the pagan May Day rituals weren't that convincing, not to mention the plot, dull, thin and meandering. The script is sorely lacking as well the dialogue at worst was absolutely laughable, as is the direction, and I was not impressed by the acting either. Nicolas Cage is an uninspired lead literally sleepwalking through his role, while Kate Beahan and Ellen Burstyn(who was so brilliant in Requiem for a Dream) can't do anything with their characters, no surprise seeing as the script leaves them little to work with.Overall, a real mess of a remake with next to no redeeming qualities. The bottom line is give it a pass and watch the far superior original instead. 1/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How did THIS masterpiece go overlooked? Such a great movie. It's one of those movie for movie buffs really, but I'm sure even the broader mainstream audience will pick on its genius. That's what this is: sheer genius.It might be unintentionally so, but how many times do you see a --Bear Suit-- in the final act of a film being pulled out with such nonchalant bravery? The beginning might leave you a little confused, but the moment you catch that horrible acting delivered by the police buddy you get a hint of what's to come: a lot of laugh-out-loud moments. Many lines of dialog are sure to become cult classic, such as "Phallic symbols, phallic symbols", "The bees are in my eyes", "How'd it get burned? X 4", "Step away from the bike" and many others.It could use a little trimming in the editing, but the slow moments are crucial to enhance the precision with which it walks on the fine line that separates farce from tragedy. Highly recommended to any film fan or to anybody looking for some (many) laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm The Wicker Man !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not a comedy; despite how funny Cage seemed in the bear suit, burning up, screaming repeatedly?Oh Boy! It's not a thriller; otherwise it's the longest, most incomprehensible, one. And it's not a horror, since I've been searching all the time for something horrific, else that script, to not find any. It's simply?a "bad" movie. And frankly, as a bad movie it is so watchable since its badness hit a unique level ! It looked like a never-ending and so stupid X File. True that there are many many thrilling moments, but the abundance of them, without any mind to control the plot or clear it up, made the whole thing as perfectly implausible and weary. Don't dare to ask what was the fact behind the blind twin sisters?, the silence of the men?, the meaning of the dead people that the lead finds in the palace?, what was in the bloody bag?, why the teacher locked up the crow?, or the reason why they didn't kill the lead since the start; as long as the whole thing is about killing him anyway ??!! (Well, that was for selling the air to us !). The wise advice here is: don't even think, as this movie didn't in the first place ! Matters like remembering the first scene in different dreams, or recalling certain memories in variable ways were all parts of the movie's plan to fill not to fulfill. The script feels as meat without bones. Just actions without one action or one step ahead. Instead of leading a live mysterious horror, it kept padding pointless images one after another till it killed the thrill, transforming the movie into a swollen stuffed animal. That's why the way of making it; is more appalling than whatever it presents, since you wonder; what kind of movie that has no drama, one solid storyline, ascending.. etc ?! The no effort to make a story, the absurdness of everything, and underrating the viewer's mentality to this extent represent a real horror for me ! Thus, with none other than empty circles round and round foolishly on screen, the eventual outcome was absolute drivel. Actually discovering that, at the end, was highly painful. At that point I was amazed, not out of the movie's hoax, but out of the movie's fact as hoax ! So why they remade it ?? Again, it's to fill. Fill the cinemas out there. The studio needed a movie, so why not to follow the very easy style lately; make new one by remaking already present another. The thing is that prevailing style, rather epidemic, has its famous symptom; THE IDIOT SCRIPT. And if the writer were that smart from the start, then they would have fulfilled whether good remakes or original movies (The most missed 2 things in Hollywood of today!).I think no re-editing could fix it to be meaningful or at least no monster. Its producers themselves, after watching it, got no guts to screen it for critics. And we read that Edward Woodward, star of the original movie, has said that while he was offered a part in the remake and declined, he nevertheless was "surprisingly impressed by the quality of the script" ??!! So, he's maybe courteous, hypocrite, or has a shitty taste !What's good then ? I loved only one moment in which Nick punches the fat woman in her face. I needed this punch to unchain my negative emotions towards the silliness of this woman and this movie. Moreover, after seeing Connery in a bear suit during the infamous (The Avengers), then Nick in the same suit during this one, I learned that wearing a bear suit in any movie must be a sign for being awful! And finally, you've got to respect the principles of the movie's makers; they believed in their work (faith), got the nerve to release it (boldness), and made something rarely bad (the desire of superiority) ! As long as the wicker man is someone who goes through worldly inferno, being tricked by evil people who burn him in fire for no crime he committed, then I'm, as the viewer of this movie, The True Wicker Man, with every poor one watched it too !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just seen the Remake of The Wicker Man this evening, and found it to be nothing like the original 1973 version. Only some parts of the film contained the same storyline. The story is about a patrolman called Edward Malus who is recovering from a tragic accident on the road, he gets a letter from his former fiancée Willow, who left him years ago without any explanation, telling that her daughter Rowan is missing. So Edward travels to the private island of Summerisle, where Willow lives which is in an odd community that happen to plant fruits, she reveals that Rowan is their daughter. Edward starts an investigation into what has happened. along the way he meets the locals who are hostile and unhelpful Edward finds out that the locals are pagans, practising old rituals to improve their harvest,and believes that Rowan is still probably alive and is being prepared to be sacrificed. I found that the story did not fit very well like the original version of the film. VERY DISAPPOINTED.</fullReview>

Then later we see he is recovering and a fellow officer brings him his mail and out of the blue he says, "Did they ever find the bodies?" WOW! Mystery on top of excitement. This is going to be a great movie!! Then the bottom dropped out. No more is said about the accident that had me so enthralled. No more about the missing people in the car. Now we start out on a completely different story but surely we will return to the first and tie it all together. The second story is a puzzle because I'm waiting (still waiting) to see what became of the people in the highway wreck. So now we meet the colorful folks on the island. And then we finally see the Wicker Man. Oh, now I get it. Cage is going to wind up in his hospital room after the auto wreck, it's all been a dream. The biggest mystery: Did Ellen Burstyn (my favorite actress from "The Exorcist") really need the money that bad, to appear in this turkey?</fullReview>

The brilliant Christopher Lee is replaced with a harmless old lady. There are, unnecessarily, bees instead of fruit, and, inexplicably, the islanders bathe in. The.

The very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic. This film doesn't fall under any of those and just remains dumb.I just kept watching the movie hoping it would get interesting at some point , but it never does.

The original was brilliantly scripted and other than the appalling miscasting of Britt Ekland as Willow, well cast. Nicolas Cage is an excellent actor but he could not bring this one off.My advice to all would be to save your time and your money and get a copy on VHS or DVD. The original cut is on an old VHS cassette. There are various DVD versions ranging from a butchered 88 minute version to a 102 minute. Go for the 95 min or 102 min versions if you can.By the way, the original soundtrack is great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It begs the question: why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything that I thought after watching this film centred around the word 'why':Why was this film necessary? Why have they made pointless, irrelevant changes to the original? Why is Nicholas Cage still cast in anything? Why have I just paid ?4.50 to see this futile rubbish?I just can't comprehend why Neil LaBute felt he needed to change every single thing about the original that made it a classic. Unlike a lot of people, I actually saw the original after I saw this remake, and I was baffled as to what the point in the new one is.Once in a blue moon, there is a good remake of an old film. Peter Jackson's 'King Kong' is an example of this - it didn't undermine the original at all and yet was still a superbly made film. But LeBute is no Peter Jackson, and there was nothing in this film to bring it to life. Cage was simply dull and the way his voice tails off towards the end of the sentence is one of those little things that will probably annoy you throughout the entirety of this film. I can't think of what the demographic was for this film. Perhaps unsighted fools like me. Fans of the original will hate it for how unfaithful it is to Anthony Shaffer's original screenplay. People who haven't seen the original will dislike it for the fact that it is... well... boring. There is no explanation as to how they get from one scene to another which makes it feel far too long, and there is no tension at all - you know that whenever anyone opens a box a bat will fly out.***SPOILERS START HERE***The ending is probably the worst part of the film (quite an achievement). The sight of the Wickerman burning the Cage to death (although it may make you cheer given that you are made to intensely dislike his character. Either that or you will just dislike him) could be made poignant and shocking - it certainly was when Seargant Howie was burnt in the original. So why did you need to see what happened 6 months later? It was completely unnecessary.In the words of Alan Hansen, it was diabolical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bizarre island hard to reach and even harder to leave.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>California cop Edward Malus(Nicolas Cage)takes some time off after a woman and her small daughter die in a fiery crash. It happened so fast all he could do is watch and his rescue attempts failed. Still recovering from this traumatic tragedy, Malus receives a call from his former girlfriend Willow(Kate Beahan), who asks him to come to a private island off of Washington state to help find her daughter Rowan(Erika-Shaye Gair). Malus arrives on Summersisle and finds the occupants are a bit bizarre. The community is under the iron fist rule of Sister Summersisle(Ellen Burstyn). The island is populated by women who treat men as second-class citizens and take part in ancient rituals and human sacrifice. Malus has no idea what he is getting into as he desperately hunts for the lost little girl.This film seems too contrived and the acting is pretty damn stale. There is absolutely no chemistry between Cage and his leading lady Beahan. Burstyn is eerie as the clan's matriarch. Other cast members: Leelee Sobieski, Frances Conroy, Diane Delano and Molly Parker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neil Howie would be spinning in his grave.... if he wasn't a Summerisle apple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read reviews of this in the past and I knew that it wouldn't be great, but I decided to buy a copy off ebay for a laugh.When watching it i began to get quite bored at the start, I didn't really care to much of the car crash and the depression that resulted after that. When Malus arrived on the island things slowly began to pick up, but when the people on the island began talking to him I knew they wouldn't be as sinister or interesting as in the original. When Malus entered the Tavern I thought to myself how dull and when he got talking to Willow I though oooooooo something exciting, wrong!!! Eventually as we all know Malus meets Sister Summersisle and a similar conversation to the original (however not as fascinating)results.However by the end of the film I was quite keen to see how the precession would be handled. Besides the fact that Sister Summersisle looked like brave heart and also that the villagers were not really into what was happening, I knew to expect little. At the conclusion when Malus pulled his gun I thought how cliché and crap we all knew it would be empty and the stinging of the bees, rubbish.I actually watched the unrated and the released version and I felt that the released versions ending was crap. I believe in the movie as like the original the bees and honey failed so thats why they had to sacrifice Malus to bring the bees and honey back to life, and burning him in the Wicker Man would solve their problems as it would please the Gods, however at the end Willow and a friend are picking up new victims obviously for their next sacrifice, which in a way discounts the whole notion of the movie on Pagan rituals, that a sacrifice will make the crops thrive, so I found that utterly stupid.When comparing this to the original, the actors in this were terrible especially Burnstyn, Cage and the one who played Willow as she seemed very indecisive about everything. The music was unoriginal compared to the original, nothing was explained very well in the remake, like their way of life, and the ideas of the animal costumes and going deep into their religion and its beliefs. I also didn't like the slight hints at rip off from other films ie don't look now (the girl in the red dress leading the man to his death) and village of the dammed (most of the kids in bland clothes and with blonde hair).Overall I was disappointed I think if I hadn't seen the original I might have given it 5 out of 10, but as their were little shocks and little interest for all involved, only watch if you have time to kill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought there would be a better ending to this movie. Since I am a big fan of Nicolas Cage's work I was excited to rent this movie &amp; watch it since I missed it in the theaters. Good Lord I am glad I waited and only paid a few dollars to rent it, this movie was pathetic. I think the build up to the ending was pretty good, it kept me shaking my head in wonder at what was going to be revealed at the end but the end was just pathetic. I don't know any other way of describing it. Just the burning of Cage and that was it. So what the heck was the entire story for? Just to show that he got some weirdo chick pregnant and he was drug to the island to be burned? It was a very unsatisfying ending and I was not a happy camper. I am not one to be pissy but damn Nic, can't you find better things to do? They could have wrapped it up a lot better than they did. He must have needed the money, I was bitterly disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicholas Cage should be ashamed of himself for making this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot believe that the same Nicholas Cage that starred in The Rock and Face Off actually agreed to make this, THE MOST GOD AWFUL MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN (and I'm 43 years old)! Note: I will never be led to watch another Nick Cage film. Know when to say "no" to your agent, Nick!! You just lost a fan, big guy...Now, on with the "review"...I did not know that this was a remake, but it wouldn't have made any difference. This movie had absolutely the worst acting imaginable, and was totally devoid of a coherent plot. If you watch this movie after reading my review, all I can say is that you were warned! Here are a few questions about this "movie": Why were we shown the scenes of him trying to save the girl in the burning car about a dozen times during the movie? It had absolutely no relevance at all to the "plot". Actually, there was no point to the semi hitting the car with the girl in it at all. And, if a semi had hit the car, that girl would likely have been killed instantly, not left sitting up in the back seat looking at Nick totally unfazed and without a scratch on her...Why did he finally get a cell signal if no one was going to show up and attempt to rescue him? Why did he have to spend the night in the water if they were ultimately going to do him in? Why didn't they just kill him when he arrived on the island? The time he spent trying to track down the girl was a total waste of film, and my time.I have to say that when the credits rolled at the end of this disaster, I was just as disappointed as I was when the credits rolled at the end of Full Metal Jacket. These are the only two movies that I can recall that ended with me staring at the TV screen (yes, this was only a $3 DVD rental, thank god!) wondering what the hell just happened, why I wasted a slice of my life viewing it, and why anyone in their right mind would agree to pay to have a pile of crap like this distributed for viewing?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Very Foundation That 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' Was Built On!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film Review: The Wicker Man (2006) Directed By: Neil LaBute Starring: Nicolas Cage, Ellen Burstyn, Leelee Sobieski, Molly Parker and some chick with grotesquley big lips.WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS....but does it really matter? Question: Are you the type of person who could enjoy a movie in which Nicolas Cage karate kicks a bunch of annoying feminists? I AM!!! I really enjoyed this film. Not because it was good mind you, but because it was so entertainly bad. This is the real deal, the very foundation that 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' was built on! One thing elevates this film from being an unwatchable piece of s**t to pure comedic gold and that one thing is Sir Nicolas Cage.Let's talk about Cage for a moment. What can I say? The man is an enigma. Is he more than a little strange? Yes. Am I disturbed by the fact that he named his son Kal-el? Yes. Do I still find myself oddly attracted to him? YES. I think he's a brilliant actor who's capable of handling dark dramatic roles (8MM), eccentric comedic roles (Raising Arizona) and weird Christopher Walkeney type roles (Vampire's Kiss). He is now heading into Charlton Heston territory.The plot of the The New 'Wicker Man' is as follows: A police officer (Cage) witnesses a freak car accident (really freak because it makes no goddamn sense and is never explained). It tramatizes him (I guess?) so he just lays around on his couch popping pills. One day he receives a letter (no stamp on it so don't ask me how it got there) from his ex fiancée (played by the fish lip lady) begging him to come help her find her daughter who has been missing for two weeks. She lives on a remote island that has no phone service so the information he gets in the letter is all he has to go on. Now his ex dumped him in a pretty harsh manner so why he chooses to go help that bitch is beyond me. Though one of his co-workers is of sound mind and tells him to not go...guess what? Cage then ends up on this "Fantasy Island" which is inhabited by a cult of hairy arm pitted, birkenstock sandal wearing, Indigo Girl listening, Lilith Fair rejects. Mere moments after his arrival he becomes instantly annoyed with these people. Wouldn't you? He meets up with the ex and she tells him that no one on the island believes that her daughter actually exists. Apparently, the cult is run by an "earth mother" type known as Sister Summersisle (played by Burstyn) who doesn't take too kindly to fish woman's "wild ways" (being as how fish woman once ran away from the place and became involved with Cage). Therefore fish lady thinks that Burstyn is hiding the kid. But as Cage starts to ask around he gets a variety of stories. He's told everything from "she's not really Fish Lady's kid" to "Fish Lady's kid did exist but she burned to death in an accident" and back to "Fish Lady's kid never existed in the first place". Okay, then Cage goes back to fish lady to vent his frustration over his failure to come up with any evidence. She then tells Cage that the girl is his daughter. Didn't see that one coming! (Please note the sarcasm.) We are then subjected to more cryptic scenes such as Cage being attacked by bees, a few dream within a dream pop out sequences, and a "what's behind that door?" chase sequence through Burstyn's house in which Cage stumbles upon a naked man covered in moles. At one point during the film, Cage looks at the Fish Lady and says "I'm completely lost.". I can't begin to tell you how f**king funny that line was to me. This movie does not make one lick of sense and it has plot holes wider than Jessica Simpson's "ravaged by the cast of Jackass" vagina. But like I wrote earlier, there is some comedy gold here. Cages sarcasm towards the islanders is hilarious! You just want him to punch one of these broads in the face and sure enough...HE DOES!!!! He also has a complete throw down with Leelee Sobieski (who's looking really hot in this flick!). As for the big sacrifice scene, be prepared to bust a gut! This is the only part of the movie that sticks to the original except here it's not scary. Prior to hoisting Cage up into the Wicker Man (where he will suffer his firey fate) the islanders break Cage's legs prompting him to yell out "MY LEGS!!! MY LEGS!!!! YOU BITCHES!!!!!".But wait until the "six months later scene" which takes place in a bar. The last five seconds are the funniest I've HEARD all year! Will you like this sort of thing? That I don't know. I want to recommend it to those who love "good bad" movies. I'm not sure that you would want to spend the full ten dollars on it so maybe just do a matinée. But if you miss the matinée, please be sure to rent it when it hits DVD. It truly has to be seen to be believed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK so I gave this a 5 only because the movie...like beginning and middle was actually pretty good. It was suspenseful and it definitely sucks you in...however...the ending it ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!! This middle was good to an extent...I mean he goes THE WHOLE MOVIE just looking for his daughter...none the less the guys that I was with and a lot of other people in the theater found a lot of the jumpy parts (to me) scary. Anyways...to sum it up...Don't waste your $7.25. Spend it on ice cream or another movie that is worth watching. I looked at these comments before I went to see the movie and thought it was just a couple of peoples opinions but seriously guys this movie really sucks! There's no point and the ending makes you so mad! Don't WASTE YOUR GOOD TIME! lol.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My god the only reason I started watching this was to get some laughs out of Nicolas Cages bad performance and sure enough that wasn't nearly the only flaw. The writing was beyond moronic. For one example being and this is no joke word for word "Its a good thing I got your voicemail other wise you would be laughing at me uh hello, hello" Unfortunately for him I was still laughing.This contains mild spoilers but you shouldn't worry about it because you don't want to watch this movie anyways. The main character brings up that he has to dig up a girls body for an autopsy to save a girls life that is at stake, now bare with me but what hes trying to say is that the girl that is already supposedly dead has her life at stake.Lastly the film didn't even have a good pace, it was boring as hell I almost fell asleep. And whenever something that is supposed to be intense happens it isn't even that fascinating. As far as my last words there is absolutely no need to see this awful film. If you want to see the funny moments of Nicolas Cage making an idiot of himself just go to youtube. Have a good day and don't ruin it with this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really lame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the original Wicker Man. This one on the other hand was beyond bad. And not in a fun bad way either. I could not enjoy it on any level. None of the good things from the original were present in this one and when they did use lines from the original it just sounded fake and forced. Even worse they added a bunch of crap that didn't improve anything. Lord Summerside was a chick in this instead of Christopher Lee. They raise bees for no reason. They changed the back story i.e. Rowan's dad just so they could add the last pointless scene. The original ending was great, this was lame. Mr Cage is terrible as usual. He punches several women which was disturbing. If you were waiting for a chance to see him kick Leelee Sobeski (sp) in the head I guess this is your chance. The highlight is the "step away from the bike" line, although at this point you are clearly laughing at a movie that is not a comedy. To sum it up the original one was a masterpiece of film making and this one was a stupid and pointless bore. Nothing good about it, I would never watch this again. The real Wicker Man I have seen several times and watch it again and again on a regular basis. This is one the worst remakes I have ever seen, almost spitting in the face of all the people who think the original was a classic. 2/10 from me, I thought going in the current score on here was probably going to be overly harsh. Not at all, this was garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Huge amount of publicity when it was released and Nicholas Cage was the only reason I caught it on telly last night. The entire experience of watching "The Wicker Man" is akin to sitting up late in the night and watch B-grade erotic suspense thriller suspending on shoddy production values. The screenplay, costumes writing, sets, performance and practically everything is so very carbon dated. Nicolas Cage as Edward Mallus is investigating a missing girl on an island. His delirious look, spineless gait and hamming make you wonder if he was actually stoned or putting up appearances. His chemistry with Kate Beahan was zero. One would expect sparks when Ellen Burstyn enters the frame, alas she was a total letdown. In comparison Frances Conroy did a better job. The ending is so obvious that one can see it from miles away. Fans of original "The Wicker Man" would undoubtedly cry foul. And Nicolas Cage as an actor/ producer needs to wake up to the real world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Embarrassingly awful remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicolas Cage stars in the remake of 'Wicker Man', and this version is so silly, it's beyond belief. A Bee-like culture of women trick Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) into caring for a little girl in order to basically screw him over. The problem is, the whole premise of the island this time round just doesn't work, and seems to suit Neil LaBute's issues with women. Some scenes are just laughable and so bad that it makes you cringe- like Cage in a bear-suit. I got the edited version of this film and I managed to see the edited scenes elsewhere- and i think i may have switched it off if they were included. Somethings are better left alone and not remade!1.5 out 5!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Neil LaBute.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>He has a problem with women, they are always portrayed as cold and evil in his work, so an island full of them isn't a stretch. Even the little girl in the beginning is cruel. That's the big problem in this film. Labute doesn't like women, therefore the women in this movie are not likable, therefore it's not as interesting or thought provoking as the original. Nicolas Cage doesn't help matters, his character seems less stoic than and more comatose. Who are you supposed to relate to when both sides are unlikable? And the movie is strangely square. The British version from 1973 is far more dangerous, even if it's soundtrack is filled with folk music, especially because it's soundtrack is filled with folk music. This Wicker Man is PG-13! Since the women are demonic, they wouldn't be shown in a sexual way, the only reason the original is R-rated. So you're left with a tame, lame version of good story beaten down by it's adaptor's prejudices.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want a GOOD horror/thriller, this most certainly isn't one. However, if you appreciate a so-bad-it's-funny movie, this is a fantastic choice - I was laughing so hard I nearly died. I enjoy Nicholas Cage in quirky roles (Adaptation, Matchstick Men) but his work here is the kind of performance old actors remember with horror as the most embarrassing moments of their lives. His Edward Malus behaves like a mix between a psycho and a moron (emphasis on "moron"); it looks as if Cage was trying to channel Homer J. Simpson (now that I think about it, this would be perfect as a Simpsons Halloween Special). His whole performance has a delightfully ludicrous quality to it - the way he alternates between shouting and mumbling in a sleepy monotone, his reaction shots to every situation, from trivial sights to absurd occurrences. He even runs funny.To be fair, Cage is given such horrible lines and uproarious scenes - running around in a bear suit, rolling down a hill pursued by bees - it's not entirely his fault. In fact, all other performers - from lovely Molly Parker, Leelee Sobieski and Kate Beahan (who deserves an award for the best "deer caught in the headlights" impression) to award-winning Ellen Burstyn - are also terrible, although not funny as Cage. What's amazing is NO ONE of the dozens of professionals involved in the making of this movie realized they were doing an unintentional comedy - and yeah, it was unintentional; don't believe anyone who claims otherwise, because the film speaks for itself here. How could director LaBute think someone was going to take his remake of The Wicker Man seriously, it's flat-out astonishing. Maybe he was too busy cramming in as many Freudian/sexual references as possible, expecting a lot of "ooooh! clever!" reactions.This will become a cult classic, something Ed Wood would have been proud of. 3/10 as a serious movie, but as a comedy it's a 10/10.</fullReview>

When compared to the folks at Warner Brothers who actually chose to release this steaming pile of nonsense, Flushy The Fish was a freaky genius.Within 10 minutes of Ed's arrival on Corny Thespian Isle everyone in the theatre knew exactly how the movie would end. Okay, to be fair, the roaches crawling around on last week's popcorn may have been surprised by the final "twist" of the plot. But I assure you, they were the only ones. The rest of us were left suffering through the next 88 minutes of Ed doofily running around the island and wondering why the background noise was that of a Louisiana swamp when we were supposed to be in the Pacific northwest.Maybe the DVD's alternate endings will feature demon zombie ninjas from hell rising from the earth to devour Sister Sumersisle's spleen and drink martinis from her skull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy of most things Shatnerian - "Why is .. it .. BURNED ??.... Why ...isitburned???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is unfortunate that I review this movie after just seeing Crank. I still think I am seeing spots and I am definitely coming down. Solipsist and Oscar winning master thespian, Nicholas Cage, stars in either a farcical story of cross-cultural misunderstanding or in a unintended B-movie-like-comedy, complete with over-the-top, Shatner-like acting. I think it is the latter, but I leave it up to history and the experts to decide. So the Cage, as I like to call him, is doing his best impersonation of Erik Estrada in Chips. He gets a note from his fiancée, which states that her daughter is missing and if he could help. Mind you, this is the woman who disappeared from his life, years before. She lives on an isolated island in the Northwest part of the country. An island that is mostly populated by a female Amish/Quaker-like commune. The rest is relatively meaningless. If you want meaning, you might as well check out the original movie. This movie is just there for the laughs.The Cage is not a very good actor. As one of my comrades one said of him - "He's the same in every movie." He is an actor playing himself and not doing it very well. The Cage has been in some good movies, however, those were built around his "particular idiom" (Lord of War is a great example of this). On the other end, when you try to get him to act or make him feel emotion, you get this Botox coma or perhaps City of Angels. His performance in this movie can simple described as mind-numbingly-nuked. He is part angry octogenarian, part whiny, part drunk, all high-school production quality with 1/2 a bottle of pain killers. I mean the scenes in the bear suit are priceless, not to mention all the cheap shots he dishes out. Unfortunately, the hilarity mostly ensues well past the 60 minute mark. Prior to this, feel free to snicker and laugh at the lame, lame dialog. I can definitely say skip the theatrical version (go straight for the unrated version) of this movie, as you will be getting a slow motion montage-like procession scene with sound overlay instead of the actual scene. I actually was scratching my head, wondering, the first time I saw/heard it. Oh well. Highly recommended for a laugh. If you want to skip the movie all together, check out Youtube for a compilation of the best and funniest scenes in the movie. I think it's a fair trade - 3 minutes in the Cage or 90. ........................Wise choice.</fullReview>

He lost one little girl which obviously had a profound effect on him, and he was determined to find the other girl since he hadn't, in his mind, succeeded in saving the first one. I thought this was quite obvious. I really liked this movie. I wasn't expecting the ending...I was very surprised. I think some people watch movies and want everything spelled out for them.

If you have a brain and would like it to be stimulated then maybe this movie is for you. Their are many elements that coalesce to create an ideal movie experience. First, there are many class issues; this film functions a strong criticism of white male patriarchy, taking Nicolas Cages character to an isolated island, and forcing him to experience the uncanny. It is disturbing only in so far as many of the symbols (phallic of course, a white male police officer) are displaced in a society that is modeled off of a colony of bees. That is, this place is a complete matriarchy. The women here run the island. I don't want to categorized the movie as femmenist, but it is surely tends towards direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And having Nicholas Cage die while at the same time feeling sorry for him is a rare combination that only this movie could achieve. Almost sheer brilliance. This has not been done since City of Angels.I will have to see the original though, as I'm sure it's probably better. Since Hollywood can't produce anything original anymore, they have to do offer updated versions. This may or may not be bad or good I don't know. I read someone elses review who was extremely critical of the way the producer took this movie, adding his twist to it, and saying it was not worthy. I obviously can't say until I've seen the original, but I think updates of well written movies should be updated to match today's environment so they are more believable.Another thing, the movie had Nicholas Cage in it, so you KNOW it was going to be semi-cheesy. I usually can't stand Cage but he played his part VERY WELL in this movie. Kudos for his performance.</fullReview>

This new remake sees the story faithfully retold with a few changes for a modern audience. Usually I'm the first to criticise remakes, especially when they tone down the violence or 'edge' of the original, but in this case, I reckon they did a pretty decent job. Nicholas Cage is a good actor who brought plenty to the role played by Edward Woodward in the first version. I'd say Cage was actually better in fact. The key ingredient missing from this new interpretation, however, was Christopher Lee. I felt that he made the 1970s version and his replacement in this wasn't anywhere near as sinister, but aside from that, the remake is good. This time, its set in a remote island somewhere in the USA, rather than Scotland. Visually, the new film is far more satisfying as a result. The soundtrack is nothing special, but compared to Woodward's picture, its a vast improvement. This wasn't as gritty a film as its predecessor, but nevertheless, I felt it didn't change too many things from the plot. The acting was on the whole good. What was missing was the original's scenes of nudity etc, but for a 12A I never expected them to reappear. I find it strange that I enjoyed this to be honest, but I did! Cage is at his best when playing a slightly odd character, with traits of nerviness. Here he shined. I know this film gets poor reviews from many, but give it a go if you have an open mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as people say!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just wanted to ask "xiaoyuboo" first: You pay $11.00 to see a movie? That sucks.Anyways, this movie wasn't at all bad like some people have pointed out. True, the movie did have its unanswered questions, but you have to admit that the acting was good and the ending was really unexpected and (to my point) quite disturbing. Its good, but some points are pretty dumb. And the people that lived in the village really angered me. Didn't like them at all one bit! But, I guess that's why there were in the movie. I wouldn't go to the point and say "skip this movie" or call it "the worst movie of the year" because there has been some horrible ones! This movie IS NOT (and I repeat) IS NOT A "WORST MOVIE" movie. Its one of those "alright" movies. I give it a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>clever it may drag on but movies have to have a good story which this has. people who say its rubbish are talking nonsense the whole movie was good apart from a few minor things. Nicholas Cage is really good at acting in this film deffinatley one of his best moments. This film is disturbing and if. The film sticks to the original story but it has been tweaked a bit. The film is mentally scary to think of people like devil worshippers make this film the extra bit better. The film has cut out some of things to make this film a 12, loads more people can now enjoy an excellent remake of a still great movie. you liked the original you will like this. If you don't like it just because its not scary thats a bit childish. overall great!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, I can not even some up how ridiculous this movie was. I mean it was absolutely brutal. I wasn't expecting a great movie but I was at least hoping for something decent with some scares... Well the poster for the movie was the scariest thing about it. I wont even right a summary because I am afraid to relive this terrible ordeal. My girlfriend and I actually found this movie funny more then anything else. The bad acting, the horrible story that left me lost five minutes in. The people in the theatre were actually laughing hysterically at the fact that Nic Cage was kicking the crap out of a bunch of women. It was ridiculous. The best part of the movie was when the leader of the island had her face painted blue and white and some one in the next row shouted GO BRAVEHEART! Most of you wanting to see this movie will probably say "Well I'll watch it and find out for myself" I seriously would not wish this movie on my worst enemy. PLEASE I BEG YOU SAVE YOUR MONEY AND SEE SOMETHING ELSE. Ten minutes in I looked over and said to my girlfriend lets go see Step Up. Unfortunately we stuck it out for the whole god awful thing. I recommend staying as far form this movie as you can. Unless you want to see a comedy and no real ones are playing at your theatre. My summary horrible!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whereas the original transcended multiple genres, this version flunks them.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It can perhaps be unfair to compare a remake with an original when one loves the original: every change will seem a flaw, even when to somebody new to the film the changed might seem an improvement. But in this case, I think that reference to the original genuinely helps to pinpoint what's wrong with the remake.Part of the genius of the original was the the slow but relentless build-up, the way one was never quite sure where one's sympathies should lie, the way one is never sure what's going on. Slow build ups don't seem to be the fashion now, and so we get crashes and fireballs from the start. And it's made clear from the very outset that the cop (Cage) is the good guy, and nothing changes this view throughout (even when he slugs women, it's with good cause). And the inhabitants of Summersisle don't even try to hide the fact that they practice human sacrifice. So: no subtlety, then.Losing the subtlety is bad enough, but what about the story? Well, in the original the individual, seemingly unrelated, adversities that the cop suffers all turn out to be cleverly building together to meet a complex set of criteria for the climax. Well, that had the word "complex" in it, so it plainly wasn't going to happen in this version. Instead, most of those adversities (some of them from the original) turn out to be completely irrelevant to the plot, the criteria for the climax this time being very simple. Which left me wondering, "Why did they do that, then?". The plot becomes a string of beads from which the string has been removed, leaving the beads -- the individual scenes -- rolling around uselessly.Themes? The original had a conflict between Christianity and Pagainism (even if it got a bit confused between Roman Catholic and Presbyterian forms of Christianity). Well, far be it from Hollywood to give Christianity any credence now; it's only glimpsed in this version as something plainly dead and out of the equation. "Self-help" books and pharmaceuticals look as if they might fill its place, but ultimately the film turns into a nauseatingly misogynous men v. women conflict, with paganism not set against anything in particular. And whereas the original was relentlessly natural, the clumsy topping-and-tailing of the story try to give this version unnecessary supernatural overtones (and an excuse for some clumsy hallucinations in the vain hope of making it a "proper" horror film).With better acting from the scenery than the cast (was Leelee Sobieski just cast for her ability to roll her eyes badly?) and a horror-by-numbers musical score, there really is no reason to see this film. Whereas the original transcended multiple genres (horror, thriller, musical, drama...), this version flunks them all.I suppose some of the scenery and photography is OK.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horrible writing, terrible acting, stupid and out of sync soundtrack! I'm really hoping that the original was better than this. Nicholas Cage, one of my favorite actors, was just pathetic. I probably can't blame him too much for the lame performance given the even more lame script he was given to work with! Don't waste your money on this, or your TIME once it hits HBO/Max or whatever. The premise of this was good enough, but the filming, the unbelievability (is that a word?) of the characters and again, the awful, AWFUL writing just made this one of the worst movies I've seen. Maybe I'll check out the 9/11 movie Nicholas Cage is in... I'm sure he's much better in that!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LaBute, Cage And Company Have Committed Murder, And The Victim Is A Great Film Called "The Wicker Man"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw a murder committed this Labor Day at a movie theater near me, and the victim's name is a great film called "Anthony Schaffer's The Wicker Man". Neil LaBute's dreadful remake of "Anthony Schaffer's The Wicker Man" might very well be the most unnecessary remake since Gus Van Sant's shot-by-shot remake of "Psycho". This movie should never have been made.This an utterly dreadful contemporary Hollywood defiling of a British classic. The remake follows the basic plot of the original. A cop, named Edward Malus, a.k.a. Sgt. Howie in the original, played by an overacting Nicolas Cage, is lured to an island called "Summersisle" by a letter reporting a missing girl, this time on Puget Sound in Western Washington state instead of Scotland. Like in the original, Malus discovers an unhelpful neo-pagan community who appear to be ready to sacrifice the girl he is looking for after a disastrous crop failure the previous year.Along the way the makers of the remake have made some "creative" changes to the original. Gone is the clash of religious beliefs, replaced with a battle of the sexes. The island in the remake is a matriarchy filled with unlikable, man-hating females, and subservient mute males, and led by a matriarch named "Sister Summersisle" (Ellen Burstyn).Gone is the compelling character of the devoutly Christian cop Sgt. Howie from the original. Gone is the ideal sacrifice who is a virgin, a man who represents the law and is King for Day, replaced with an aimless, secular, pill popping dolt of a cop from California named Ed Malus, played by an overacting Nicolas Cage, who, in an extraordinary departure from the original plot, turns out to be the father of the girl he is trying to rescue.In the original the Punch costume worn by Howie symbolizes the Fool and the King for a Day, or part of what makes Howie an ideal sacrifice for the islanders. In the remake comedy ensues as Ed Malus dons a silly bear suit. The islanders never tell Malus the meaning of his suit or what it has to do with his impending sacrifice. Hence, the silly bear suit symbolizes all the attributes of a movie that seems to be trying to get multiple Razzie nominations (Cage and his bear suit received a nomination for "Worst On screen Couple").The sacrifice of Sgt. Howie at the end of the original is a chilling homage to Christian martyrs of the past, and the viewer doesn't doubt for a second that he is a martyr who is sacrificed in part for his religious beliefs. In the remake you can only laugh when Malus is told that he is dying a martyr's death. Martyr for what? Popping pills all day and his self-help book? Yes, the ineptness of the execution of the film is so bad it makes you laugh, but this is hardly a credit to the makers of the film. The film is not categorized as a comedy and yet viewers are counting the ways it made them laugh. The funniest line of them all is when Malus yells, "Killing me won't bring back your goddamn honey!" More comedy ensues as Cage knocks out three female cast members. Some are arguing that it should be a comedy, and they've got a point. It just doesn't raise my opinion of the film.Watching the actors in the film deliver their lines you get the sense that nobody in this movie is taking it seriously, and are only doing it for a paycheck. Perhaps this is because everybody in the cast recognized that they were making a turkey that would be ridiculed as one of the worst films of the year.May this dreck garner many a Golden Raspberry nomination (It got five) this Spring. May it also be sacrificed to the Gods and Goddesses of Great Film-making this May Day, so that we might have a better crop of Summer movies to see next year. Overall, a dreary moment in film history I regret having seen.</fullReview>

However thank you for pissing so fiendishly like a 12 year old boy who's just found his daddy's playboy and is nervous on one of the finest films I've ever seen. You changed the story, you changed the Scottish theme. You pussied out on a story about a man dying for his religion, at conflict with another. You pussied out on plot development for the sake of cheap, and I mean crack whore cheap thrills, and red herrings (I'm not even sure you knew the purpose for those devices used with supposed care in even the most thoughtless mystery story.) that went no where near the plot. It was nothing but random, and had the feel of a really bad student film. Student films are where you screw up to learn. You should not do this at the professional level. No offense, but MY student film was better. Though I shouldn't compare it to student films because that is offensive to student films!!! I don't even want to know how much money all what 20 studios that tried to get their hands on this you ruined. But at least the trailer was decent, so maybe many people will go see it. And even though it will more than likely never be a fan success, maybe it won't lose money, though at this point it deserves too.And for all obvious reasons a MAY POLL represents the penis. Not man you douche, but you thought you were being clever I guess changing the meaning of an actual religious pagan tradition.It was however worth my 5.00$ Because I spent the majority of the time laughing with my friend Rachel, we couldn't even keep a strait face after the film had finished. And I did get to see the trailer for The Fountain which looks good.I'm giving you a three, because I didn't leave, and or vomit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gutted Fish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So what did I make of the latest effort? It reminded me of a fish.....a fish out of water. To extend the comparison, it was like a gutted fish, though one that was trying to give the odd twitch of life now and again. So what was missing? Context for the most part. Who were these people? What made them tick? We don't really know. If it is a fertility cult, there is (unlike the original), little exploration of this issue. That film was not sexually explicit, but it was shot through with innuendo and reference. This one isn't. So we have a fertility cult that is seemingly lobotomised. Was this a studio requirement? Another odd thing. There's no music. The other film used music to set the scene. Here we have a pagan Celtic community in which music plays little or no part in their lives or rituals.. What else? Interesting characters, for a start. The protagonist was so flat that one didn't really care much about him. In fact, all the characters seemed to have but one dimension. It reminded me very much of one of those American 'made for TV' supernatural thrillers of the 1960s, with little exploration of anything beyond the plot line. Ah....the plot. The following may include spoilers, if you care about such things. There is a mysterious car crash that may or may not have been engineered as part of a plot to lure the victim to the island. Fine. But the writers don't know how to capitalise upon it, so we get irritating flashbacks from time to time that add little or nothing to plot development or the build up of tension. Tension? Well, not as far as I was concerned, because there wasn't really any. The only real question that anyone might ask is 'does he burn too'? Yes he does......but like an old curmudgeon, by this time I found myself saying 'thank god for that'! The only twist to the plot is the revelation that the sacrificial victim has been long in the planning stage. It seems that his original girlfriend seduced him for the purpose of having his child before decamping to her island home. He later discovers (while on the island) that the missing child is his......not that it makes much difference to the acting. And after a few months have passed since the burning, another emissary of the island cult is picking up another police cadet in a bar on the mainland...... I left the cinema pondering these questions. These people need a sacrificial victim as a sacrifice necessitated by crop failure. Fine. But he has been earmarked nearly a decade in advance. Do they have a long range forecasting facility? And then they are at it again.... Wait a minute! They obviously have a string of potential sacrificial victims that they keep in reserve against natural disasters. But if that is so, why do they all seem to be policemen? I mean, you would think the local forces would have noticed...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Horror Remakes Work, Some Don't. "Wicker Man" Collapses Into The Latter Category</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it: Remakes of classic movies are comparable to treading on thin ice. Remakes of classic horror movies are considered worse, especially when the original was excellent. There are few examples of horror remakes that manage to shine brighter than the originals (The Fly and The Thing); remakes that are nowhere near as good as the originals, but still manage to work (House of Wax, The Omen and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre); and the remakes that sully both the original and all involved in the remake (Van Sant's Psycho, Carrie and The Fog). Unfortunately, playwright Neil LaBute's redo of the cult classic The Wicker Man falls (very hard, I might add) into the third category.The plot remains the same as the original, except for a few minor changes: police officer Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) is summoned to the honey-collecting colony of Summersisle by a former lover of his, Willow (Kate Beahan). It seems her daughter Rowan (Erika-Shaye Gair) has disappeared without a trace, and Edward is the only one who can find her. The townspeople ? all women (Frances Conroy, Leelee Sobieski, Molly Parker, and Diane Delano, among countless others), sans a few men who help around the colony ? are all unhelpful, some claiming that the girl does not exist while others say that she has died. The search leads Edward to Sister Summersisle (Ellen Burstyn), the leader of the island, who also happens to be the head priestess of the Pagan religion that dominates the whole island, and a terrible realization: every year, a sacrifice is given to the Sun Gods through something known only as "the Wicker Man" in exchange for healthy crops and delivery of honey. And it seems Rowan has been picked as this year's sacrifice...When the preview first aired in June (around the same time the remake of The Omen was released), it was evident that LaBute's Wicker Man would be nothing like Robin Hardy's 1973 classic, which can best be described as "a sexy Pagan musical." Gone are the ongoing musical numbers, nubile young women parading around flames in the nude, hares, Christopher Lee in drag and a dubbed Britt Ekland seducing Edward Woodward's pious Sgt. Howie through the walls of her room while she sings, dances, and caresses her sensual form, replaced with a dull Nicolas Cage, who will most likely be up for a Razzie nomination next February (which is especially sad, considering how perfect he was last month in Oliver Stone's World Trade Center) who gets a laugh every time he beats up a woman (in a bear suit, no less!), an opening that has nothing to do with the story itself (as well as an unneeded epilogue that, God help us, leaves the door open for a James Franco-headed sequel), an uninspired score by Angelo Badalamenti, and a complete reworking of the townspeople and the idea of good vs. evil, which is the biggest mistake the movie makes. LaBute, famed for his unapologetic misogyny, has changed it from a township of men and women sacrificing a pious virgin (but let's be honest: who, in their right mind, would buy Nicolas Cage as a virgin?) to better their crops to an island of droning, feminine-worshiping butchers who only use men to procreate and toss them away (well, burn them away) like yesterday's garbage. Original Wicker Man scribe Anthony Shaffer must be rolling in his grave over this.However, for all the wrongs of The Wicker Man, there is one element that nearly makes up for most of them: Ellen Burstyn as Sister Summersisle. While she is no Christopher Lee, Burstyn commands the screen with her revered presence and manages to salvage the last half-hour of the movie, which is when the plot actually starts to heat up."Welcome, Mr. Malus. You have come of your own free will to keep your appointment with the Wicker Man." This short line of dialog uttered by Ms. Burstyn is nothing more than a reminder of an appointment I regret having made. But I will not attempt to persuade or dissuade you, the reader, from viewing The Wicker Man. If you want to see it to see how the American movie studio has converted a British classic or for Ellen Burstyn and the ending (which remains faithful to the original in almost every detail, except without Edward screaming for Jesus and the townspeople rejoicing and singing as the Wicker Man burns), be my guest. I am just offering a notice of caution and recommendation towards other movies in theaters within the genre. Or, better yet, just go to Blockbuster or Netflix and rent the original Wicker Man. At least you won't want to throw a half-full Diet Coke at the screen watching the original.D-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Question I Ask the Movie Gods: Why T'Was This Movie Made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie at an early screening with some of my fellow co-workers at our movie theatre. I think the majority of us, including myself, thought that this was a horror/suspense/thriller. I have not had the chance to catch the original yet, so I was still kind of foggy on the plot of the movie, but luckily for me the movie didn't have a plot.I guess the plot summary for the movie would be that after a traumatic event Nicolas Cage goes on a personal hunt to find the kidnapper and the little girl, the girl supposedly taken, that is the daughter of a former girlfriend of Cage's. So basically he goes to this Amish-like village to find this little girl who everybody, except the mother, denies existence. But then later...they know who she is. This goes back and forth all the time I think mainly because they couldn't make up their minds. Cage wanders through the village questioning people and whipping out his badge. He screams, "I'm a cop!!!" five thousand times, but nobody really believes him. Cage doesn't even believe he's a cop.The music in this film is horrible and doesn't add anything to it. The direction is weak and standard, but at least there wasn't any shaky-cam.I would suggest not seeing this film, because well, it sucks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Holy Celtic(?) Cow? Once upon a time the Romans set about conquering the "known" world. Once they established a set "civilised" city for any given area, they demonized any pre-established civilisation they conquered. Hence the whole concept of the Wicker Man - a completely unsubstantiated legend.The theory might have worked here however. But for the fact that the editing butchered anything even remotely relating to a plot.Shortly after Nicolas Cage's character entered the "bar", I informed my husband that the plot was obvious. He asked me why. I told him the ending but that I hoped it was a fantasy of some kind based on the whole fire symbolism and a potential comatose resolution. It was so sad that it wasn't.How fabulous that the stellar female cast seemed to bank on the apparently original script which clearly had the potential needed for everyone to sign on. Let's face it, these are the actresses of our time. How unfortunate, however, that the editors, producers, or whoever butchered this piece of cinema were allowed access. You all should have backed off and allowed this to be what it could have been instead of the "oh dear what on earth could we end this with, let's pick this one based on viewer comments even though we set it for another ending which could have explained at least *something* in the opening car crash bit" You know what, this viewer is done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry to say it, but it was one of the few times I've felt like asking for a refund. The movie was slow, unimaginative, contrived, and predictable. Though the acting was solid enough, the characters were unbelievable.The trailers on TV and in the theaters are totally misleading...they have nothing to do with the film. Nor do many of the pieces of the plot.**mini-spoiler** For instance, the traffic accident which seem to be the premise for the film -- if you stop to analyze it, not only doesn't play into the story line; it does not support the final "conclusion" that there is nothing supernatural going on.Contrived plot lines: Cage's character, who was "chosen" by Willow years ago just happens to be involved in a horrific traffic accident which puts him on leave from his duties as a police officer and puts him in a position to respond to the mysterious note. He goes to the island which has a commune that survives by raising bees and making honey and he just happens to be allergic to bees (which, by the way has no real consequences in the movie); when trying to sneak into the final ritual he just happens to come across the one person on the island who wears a full-body costume; he carefully checks his weapon for ammo but when he really needs it, it has had the bullets remove and Willow just happens to have them in her hand at the ceremony; at one point his cell phone rings but there is no connection -- what does that have to do with anything???? I should have suspected something when the 10:00 O'clock showing of the film on the first Friday of its run was 2/3rd's empty. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.

The plot was slow and boring. Cage may have not been the right part for this character. He only become somewhat believable about the last 15 minutes of the movie. He wasn't aggressive as a police officer at all. No policeman I have ever encountered acted this way. The whole religious plot tends to lead to all religions are crazy. There wasn't enough evidence to support that the religion was actually one that worked in the move or one of a bunch of crazy people. This may have been what they were hoping for, but I couldn't tell if I not following it. The whole movie was very vague. I may be worth watching on video. It was not worth watching in the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After witnessing the trailers for the wicker man remake, I was filled with a sort of curiosity. The original being one of my favourite films ever, I thought I might as well have a look and see what this version was like. I thoroughly regret that decision.Unfortunately this remake is completely lacking in all departments, the acting is unbelievably half-hearted, as though the actors just really couldn't be bothered. The script and plot is basically a simplistic version of the all mighty original. The remake left out many important details that made the original an absolutely astounding film - the soundtrack was gone, the character of lord summerisle (played by the legendary Christopher Lee) was replace with sister summerisle who was just like a kind old demented auntie, the may pole sequence is gone, the beetle in the desk has been replaced by a crow, it's left out the religious element which was basically the foundation of the original film.. 'Good vs. Evil' so to speak. The most chilling thing for me about the original was the end sequence where Edward Woodward was being burned in the wicker man, he was shouting out passages from the bible and the inhabitants of Summerisle were singing, it truly was a chilling thing to witness.Another thing that was left out was the overt sexuality of the inhabitants of summerisle. This, I feel, is a very important part of the plot as it ties in with Paganism.After watching this remake I felt very blaaaah (thats the only way to describe it in all honesty).The trailers for this film really are misleading, they've just pieced together random little segments of the film that have promise, yet when you actually see the film you feel very cheated. I really am surprised that this came to the cinema, I would have thought it would have gone straight to Video/DVD release.Although this remake may make others who have not seen the original feel completely cheated and angry at having paid money to see such an awful production, I definitely recommend you see the original - you will not be disappointed, it has a much better storyline and the soundtrack is beautifully eerie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apparently, you're cool if you hate this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read several reviews here that reeked of arrogance and tried a little too hard to tear the film apart. They ended up becoming the very reason I gave it a chance. I saw the original and loved it, in spite of some silliness and a dose of 70s naivety. This remake has some slightly greater faults, but nothing's anywhere near as bad as the haters want you to believe. The current rating of 3,6 is absolutely ridiculous, especially when compared to the 7,5+ ratings that cheap exercises in vulgarity like Saw get. It just shows what a refined movie lover the average IMDb user can be.I started watching TWM expecting to give up on it in less than 20 minutes, but an hour later I still couldn't find anything seriously wrong with it. It doesn't follow the typical thriller formula, it's much more subdued and creepy, with a handful of shocks thrown into the mix. If you're in the mood for something more down to earth, that for the most part is exotic and mysterious, AND you're willing to overlook a couple of tiny moments of unintentional hilarity, you won't regret having seen it.The cinematography's gorgeous, Angelo Badalamenti's music needs no introduction, and Nick Cage creates a sympathetic character that's completely out of his element and is forced to adapt to a world where nobody cares about the rules he's used to. There are no car chases here, no shootouts, there's hardly any violence, but a sense of loneliness and desperation that personally I found intriguing. It's not often that you watch a cop main character being the most helpless guy in the movie, but here it's done plausibly and I enjoyed the atypical situation. There's more to be said, but I think you'd be better off watching TWM with as fresh a perspective as possible.So, expect a flawed minimalist thriller, but one in which the good far outweighs the bad. See it in the best available quality because the visuals are the movie's greatest strength.7,5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie entertaining. It was well-paced and had an interesting premise. I had not read anything about this film nor had I seen the original so the clever unexpected twist at the end was a genuine surprise.Nicholas Cage does a good job as the outsider investigating a creepy island full of residents who barely seem to tolerate him. Its always nice to see Ellen Burstyn on screen, though she's largely on autopilot here.I loved all the references to the hierarchy of the bee colony; queens, workers and the drones. This becomes part of the plot. Forget all the negative reviews ... my advice is to go with it and enjoy a well made film as it plays itself out.Who knows; maybe I'll catch the original from the early 70's some day.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously, what were they thinking? Now I've never even seen the original, but from the reviews I heard over it, it must be pretty good. So I went and bought myself this remake just to prepare for the original.Now I've heard about of how horrible this movie was, so I took that already in precaution.Instead, I found myself laughing till my sides split. This is not a thriller, more so even a serious one at times, this is a very funny movie, although unintentional. The laughs I got were unforgettable, especially with the usually-good Nic Cage hamming it up with his superb overacting that makes the film look comedic. The bad supporting actors, horrible music score and atrocious subplots all make this a hilariously bad movie.The cinematography and set pieces are good, but even them cannot save the movie from what it is - an abysmal, horrendous train wreck that, instead of leaving audiences terrified for months, left us howling in laughter, unintentionally of course. The director, LaBute seriously needs to get help, fast. His commentary on the DVD proves that there's something wrong with him. He's telling us the hardships and determination the cast and crew took while trying to make this a serious picture, but what we see on the screen is an exact opposite of what he is trying to vision. Neil, come on! You are better than this!! Aside from unintentionally (there's that word again) funny lines, this movie is a must to avoid - especially if you are a fan of the original. If you like comedies, bad movies or simply unintentionally funny movies, then give this a try.Had this been a comedy, I would have given this an 8.4/10, but seeing this as a serious movie gone horribly wrong, I give this a 1.2/10, showing it as it is. IMDb users, I know some of you voted it a 10/10 as a funny film, but please, this movie deserves its place in the Bottom 100, alongside Battlefield Earth and Baby ''shudder'' Geniuses. Please, if you are reading this, change your votes to 1 so that it is listed in its rightful place as a piece of rubbish.Thank God Cage came back with National Treasure: Book of Secrets!!1.2/10Delton</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so if you compare this to the original film then of course you will be severely disappointed. However, I don't think it warrants the bad reviews it has received. If you can treat this movie as a piece of film-making in it's own right then it becomes a passable composition.Cage is (as always) Cage and you get some reasonable performances from the supporting cast, it's a shame they decided to re-film it in the States as opposed to the Scottish Highlands as I think the highlands have a lot more feel about them. If the original location had been kept then I believe the movie may have been more atmospheric and the mood would have suited the genre better.All in all, never gonna be in anybody's top 20 but it ain't THAT bad!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, Hollywood is a fickle beast lately. I guess they figure they've earnt some kudos with movies like 300 and The Departed and so think we'll let them off wasting our time and money with complete crap like The Wicker Man. Unlike the remakes of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes which were total re-imaginings that stood well on their own, here we have an unimaginitive retread of the original, the only bit of note that I remember being the ending (which they kept here).I was really unimpressed with Cage in Ghost Rider and here he does nothing to redeem that travesty. Although he isn't quite as terrible he phones in another "couldn't give a rats arse" performance. Guess he needs to eat, same as everyone else. There isn't a single scare in the whole movie and AGAIN it's cliché cliché cliché, some of which were a push when used in the original over 35 years ago for heavens sake.Even people who haven't seen the original version will see the ending coming a mile off. The photography is pants, the acting is pants and the direction is lacklustre and by the numbers and this movie is just an exercise in banality all round really.I think I'm just going to get a rubber stamp made up for my IMDb reviews (a cyber one obviously)as I seem to be saying the same stuff over and over again for most of the movies I'm seeing lately. Are we really reaching the bottom of the barrel? It seems we might be. Well as long as we're mug enough to keep supporting this crap, someone, somewhere will keep churning it out....</fullReview>

I assume it led to some explanation why he wanted to help the girlfriend.I didn't understand why it was there......Or why he would trust/want to help/respond to a loony bird girlfriend that left him cold....Or why he would continually show a badge and refer to "police duty" in a place he had absolutely NO jurisdiction....Or why he wouldn't have contacted the Washington State Police, FBI, etc., in the matter of a missing little girl so someone in the world knew he was there......Or how these women of significant planning was going to explain his disappearance to all the police that he worked with and for......Or why the fact that the other men/boys were treated as slaves without tongues and he expected to somehow intimidate or influence the women...There are several hundred more "ors" I just don't have the interest to continue with them...Really Bad movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(SPOILER ALERT!!)OK, first of all, there are some of you that said this was the worst movie that either you have ever seen or that has been EVER MADE. Well, I certainly understand your feelings on the issue. However, I don't think it was the WORST movie I have ever seen, ONLY because it arose so much ANGER in me. I have to at least give it respect for doing that. Not only did this movie utterly infuriate me because of the way they betrayed and tortured poor Nick Cage before they roasted him alive, but made me understandably ticked off at the whole female species for the way they played off his kind heart. Now that its been a few days since I experienced the movie and my passion has died down, I no longer hate women and their potential deceit. I would be silly to compare all women to those evil witches. And again, I am judging this movie not on how the story ended, but on the degree of emotion I felt after the credits. I honestly don't know if I would recommend this movie to any of my friends, only to protect them. The funny thing is, the guy that recommended it to me said that it totally ticked him off and warned me that it would do the same. I guess I can't blame anyone but myself.... Grrr...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I must say that when I decided to see this movie I didn't know it was a remake from a 1973's British movie, I thought it was an original plot? Second, I also didn't know it has such a low rate here on IMDb. If we just forget about the "remaking issue" (ok, I usually don't appreciate remakes too!), what the well is so wrong with this movie, to have such a bad rate?? In fact, the original movie has a great rate and, as far as I could see (here, on IMDb), this remake is very close to the original one. So, as this one is the only one I saw, I will vote on this movie as I was voting on the original, and my vote will be very close to the rating of first movie then?I really did appreciate this film! I think it has a good plot, it has mystery, suspense, great scenarios, and an ending that in spite of not being unexpected is a good conclusion, because it doesn't turn out well. Yes, it has a tragic end, and I appreciate it because it's not very common and fits extremely well in this story! I just still don't understand what the hell has the car crash, in the beginning, to do with all the rest. It seems that it was included just to create guilt and memory flashbacks in the main character? but has nothing to do with the rest of the plot! Though it was a nice beginning, because it created more tension to the movie?The bad points of the movie are that sometimes it turns a bit slow and too centered in the main character, but it's all a part of the game anyway! The good points are its plot and the ending? I thing it was cruel, but extremely real to a story like this!</fullReview>

Sure, I read many user comments and then I rented the DVD and watched the movie. Sure, you might not like Nicolas Page, but hey, come on, there's nothing wrong with the movie. One user says Wicker Man was not mysterious or suspenseful. Sure, every community has an island like this so what's the big deal eh? Has any one here read Shirley Jackson's "The Lottery"? I suppose some of you didn't like it because things happen that make no sense and are unexplained. Wow....I didn't think WIcker Man was the best movie I ever watched, but it certainly did what it was supposed to do. It showed me one weird place with a group of messed up people. One user said the dialogue was ridiculous. Have you ever spoken with a messed up person? I found the dialogue very close to the reality of a very troubled mind. I think it is sad that a lot of people just seemed to have had a mental breakdown because they watched Wicker MAn 2006. Again, if you're not taking your medication, don't watch the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Remake, Not Quite That Bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wicker Man" is a remake of the 1973 cult classic that starred Christopher Lee. This film opens with Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage), a police officer, who witnesses the accidental death of a young woman and her daughter. Six months later, his ex-fiancée, Willow (Kate Beahan), sends him a letter asking him to come to Summers Isle, a secluded island that homes an isolated farming community with their own ways of life, where she now lives, to help find her daughter, Rowan, who has gone missing. The locals seem to be living in a different time, and consist mainly of women, whom aren't too friendly with Edward. While investigating into the young girl's disappearance, and rehashing his previous relationship with Willow, Edward discovers that a pagan-type ritual is about to begin, and he thinks that Rowan may be part of the sacrifice. But while Edward becomes obsessed with saving the little girl, he isn't aware of the fact that it might be himself who needs to be saved.I really loved the original "The Wicker Man". It wasn't a 'scary' film per se, but it was a unique clash of belief systems and was captivating to watch - especially because of Christopher Lee's amazing performance. While it did have a few downfalls, it was overall a fine piece of work and is fully deserving of it's cult status. Neil LaBute updates the film, twisting the plot around a little here and there, and adding in some new characters and revelations in the story. This film is actually fairly well written, and while many disagree, I didn't find it boring in the least. The script was very well-plotted and paced, and the revelations in the plot were given out at the right moments. Aside from the story, there's some great scenery to offer and the island really is beautiful - the landscape of the island is very well established in this film, which is one improvement on the original in my opinion. The acting wasn't all bad either. Nicolas Cage was good for the most part, there were a few scenes that I think were a little overdone and his acting was a bit hammy, but nothing too major. Unlike the original film, in which the island's leader was a man, in this film the leader is Sister Summersile, played perfectly by Ellen Burstyn - probably most famous for her role in the 1973 horror landmark, "The Exorcist". She's great in the movie, she's really great in everything I've seen her in, so no complaints there. Kate Beahan is okay as Willow, but at times she conveyed mixed emotions and I wasn't sure what she was going for. Molly Parker ("Intensity") plays another villager very well, and Leelee Sobieski ("Joy Ride", "The Glass House") is good as an odd worker. The acting is overall okay, some of it wasn't great, but I've seen worse. What I really don't understand more than anything is the consistent hate directed toward this movie. The story really isn't all that different from the original, it has a few spins on it (among them being the female-dominant community and the island leader being a woman, and Edward's relation with the Willow character), but for the most part, this film is pretty close to it's predecessor. I hear a lot of complaints about the way that the film ends also, which leads me to believe that the majority of this film's audience never even saw the original film, because they both ended in practically the same way (I did watch the extended ending on the DVD, which was much better than the theatrical ending, I might add, although not really all that different). The ending is harsh and abrupt, just like the original film's was, and just as it should be. So why all the complaints? I thought it was a pretty solid suspense film, and it'd be hard to convince me otherwise.Overall, "The Wicker Man" isn't that bad of a movie - and nowhere near as bad as some reviewers have made it out to be. I thought it was an entertaining, well-done horror film with all things considered. Some of the acting was questionable, but besides that I thought it was good. You probably won't be scared by it, but if you enjoy a good suspense-thriller, you'll more than likely find this as a good rental. Also check out the original film, which is excellent (and better than the remake). 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie it's far from being a horror, but it's a funny way in which the Pagan ways are depicted, and all I can say is that it brought me a great mood, and revived my Pagan pride. Leelee Sobieski is beautiful. I don't see why wouldn't this movie be enjoyable for non-Pagans too (Christians for example), as it's very original, one of the best movies Nicholas Cage might have brought himself into.Honestly, this is not a 10 star movie, but I can't give it less then 7.5, perhaps the extra 0.5 (which rounds it to 8) would be my personal weakness for Leelee Sobieski so, take it at somewhere between 7 - 8. You won't waste your time nor money at the Cinema, I didn't, it brought me an outstanding mood, mostly Leelee Sobieski's smile at the end of the movie, terrific!!! See it by yourself.</fullReview>

The scenery/use of light/cinematography were out of this world. It restored my faith in 'simple' movies (little or no special effects).Watch the movie, let yourself be transported to a time when people lived a simple life and held dances round the maypole.

This summer, we've seen our share of bad movies: Crossover; You, Me, and Dupree; etc.So, hoping that a movie with Nicholas Cage's name attached to it would be half tolerable, I sat down in the front row of Wicker Man with a bag of popcorn and a 54oz coke. I couldn't have been more shocked and appalled at the crap I was seeing on the screen: terrible acting, terrible directing, and, more importantly, a terrible story.I was so offended, nay, insulted, that Nicholas Cage was partaking in this travesty of a film! His acting was reminiscent of a high school play and I couldn't help but laugh at every line he delivered.When was it last, when good directing, acting, and story was combined into one film in Hollywood? I mean, we've resorted to remake after remake after remake. It is a TRAVESTY.

The movie in my honest opinion deserves a D-. It's like a vague outline of a story. I honestly liked Uwe Bole's movies more, and that's saying something. I was ready to walk out the theater, except for the fact I was spending time with my girlfriend. She also commented on the movie seeming as though it was thrown together in a rush just to put Nicholas Cage on the screen again before people forget about him. And while we're on that subject, Nick, great acting, wrong movie. But overall I was disappointed, the trailer's made the movie seem great. The movie was THE TRAILER!Two thumbs down.</fullReview>

I thought it a very cleverly updated screenplay that tied together the improbable plot far more gracefully and more beautifully than the original ever did, and even added a few twists. I actually found the performances very engaging?and in such a way that they served to distract from the overly stylized set design and wardrobe: This is not Cage's best work but he was "workmanlike" in just about every way. Ellen Burstyn looked great. I loved all the sinister crones and the strange twins everywhere?I thought it was a very effective treatment to what is, really, an absolutely absurd plot.It's major weakness was the ending: the original was simply more shocking, but probably impossible to replicate for a contemporary audience. And let's be honest here, people--the original Wickerman is Midnight Movie High Camp at its absolute best! Britt Ekland and her fake Scottish accent; Scottish folk song soundtrack sung by an Italian singer; Christopher Lee in DRAG???? All of these Wickerman snobs might be thankful that the remake kept a respectful and suitably outlandish flair in tribute to the venerable original.</fullReview>

In short, this remake is terrible.Well, okay, the scenery is beautiful, and the girls are pretty.But the script is very incoherent, with the logical connection between the cop's nervous breakdown (with hallucinations) and the events on the island is totally not established, and the mythological background of the island's feminist society can best be described as mostly inaccurate, out of context where at all even close to accurate, and a hash of misused ideas overall. Even the concept of a hive-type society is not used in a proper manner. It's as if Mr. LaBute and his colleagues just slapped together a bunch of stuff that scared them as children.Nicholas Cage's emotional expressions run the gamut from A to B (to paraphrase an earlier critic). Ellen Burstyn and the other ladies are not allowed to use any of their formidable talents. One can only conclude bad direction is at fault.Much of what made the earlier movie so wonderful: the old-style folksongs and music (many of which were authentic), the use of surviving pre-Christian English customs and festival-practices, the emphasis on fertility and sexuality (without being crude, another thing that most modern film-makers seem incapable of doing) are all missing.One can only conclude that Mr. LaBute may have watched the original movie, but he didn't really SEE it.Save your money &amp; rent or buy the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the dumbest movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i can think of no other movie that made less sense this year. while crossover and zoom make take the cake for worst movies of the year, this one is definitely the dumbest. with a somewhat descent acting job by Nicholas Cage, the movie held for a while, and then finally fell very very far from being even recognizable as a movie. with zero substance, and zero plot, the only parts of the movie that made me feel the slightest bit okay with paying for it was seeing Cage beat the crap out of some ugly girls, and then running around in a bear outfit for no explainable reason. while i would have enjoyed seeing more of it, and more of Cage just go ballistic on these psychotic women, i just didn't care enough by the end of the movie. actually, i didn't care throughout most of the movie. it wasn't scary, and it scraped the definition of entertaining. all i can say is, better luck next time.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly underrated, a terrific intellectual thriller, no need for blood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm tired of horror films that shock you with trick camera cuts or lots of blood and gore. To me, the intellectual thrillers are the best, like Silence of the Lambs, or the works of H.P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe.I'm aware that it's a minority opinion, but I really enjoyed the film and I would urge you to overlook the huge fans of the original. Fans are a strange bunch. They have such nostalgia for the past that they can't see that the quality of movies have improved vastly in 40 years. Instead of celebrating the attention that a remake (of whatever quality) brings to the original, of course they can't help themselves in a frenzy of shredding it because their favorite plot points are gone.My, my. Aren't we serious.I've seen both versions and to me the remake is superior. The production quality is higher, as reflected in the costumes and visual and sound quality.Also, the "Christians as victims" theme has been removed, leaving, to me, a purer, distilled theme: that humans can do unimaginable things to each other. Of course, it's horrific because it's also true. Humans did create the Nazis. We do create cults.The plot is tighter, with fewer lags for exposition, and the nudity in the original is really unnecessary.To me it was spookier than The Island of Dr. Moreau. And the original is great too. I think we should support them both and stop being such whiners.I give The Wicker Man (2006) an 8 out of 10 and if you're looking for just one good review to encourage you to give this film a try, you have found it! :)Johnny Monsarrat Consulting.

		<fullReview>This movie has such a low rating which is shocking. I don't consider this one to be boring or to be a bad movie. Some users have criticized particular users that they have not watched enough movies because they considered this to be a good movie. That is BS. I would like to know what kind of movies that they enjoy. This is a movie where either people would really like it or they would hate it. So if anyone enjoyed Village, watch this and you would enjoy. All others spend your money on something that all of you would like such as Napoleon Dynamite(losers) or The Condemned (predictable ending). Have fun who ever watches it. And I would appreciate feedback on what I said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as Good as the Original but not as bad as expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler at the end I watched this movie expecting to roast it in Mystery Science Theater fashion but it wasn't really in that caliber of bad. It had Nicholas Cage yes so there were several grade grunts and groans about his leaden line deliveries. I was expecting to see Satanic rather than pagan imagery but was pleasantly surprised that some of the things in the trailers seem to have been ploys to bring in the standard horror movie crowd.This movie is still nowhere near the caliber of the original which is one of my all time favorite movies. There really aren't any scenes that match the best scenes of the original. For instance, no tempting scene with Britt Eckland pounding the walls in the buff, dancing to a tribal rhythm. There was no terrific celtic bar music and bawdy pub humor or semi-travel-log bits which added real charm to the original movie.Not a great movie by a long shot but not really as horrible as I was lead to believe. I bought the DVD with the "shocking" ending which ended up just meaning there wasn't the add on bit with girls showing up in a city looking for fresh sacrifice bait. Not really shocking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly high quality disturbing remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the directors cut of the Wicker Man 2006 the other night. I and my wife were expecting to see a travesty of the original however we were surprised that the eeriness and surrealism had survived through into this remake. While certain scenes have been updated to fit into a more modern audience the overall narrative of the original is here. The ending of this version is even more surreal than the original one and quite disturbing. Be warned not for the faint hearted. As I've said that is the directors cut and as I believe a lot of scenes have been reinstated that was cut in the cinematic version so that it could be bizarrely cut down to a PG 12 certificate when it was quite clear that this film was never intended for a family audience.</fullReview>

If it were possible to give this movie a negative vote, I would. I have never walked out on a movie, but this one had me edging towards the door. Just bad bad bad. Cage has never shown me to be a great actor, but he's been at least watchable. In WTC, he put forth a remarkable effort. For Wicker Man, I can't even say he mailed it in. If it hadn't been his face on the screen, I'd have never believed it was him. If you must throw away your money to see this, save the couple hours out of your life and send me the rental fee instead. Trust me, you'll thank me later. Of course, that's just my opinion... I could be wrongWhip</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful attempt at a cult classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright this movie made pagans look like Hollywood satanists and I find this to be one of the biggest problems of the story. Sure its nail biting for a few scenes when random occurrences keep happening like lots of twins, spooky bees, old creepy ladies with football face paint among other things like old men half naked with missing eyes. Not to mention the fact that for some odd reason most of the conversations going on in the film is only understandable after a few pints of beer. So many questions start to be asked as to why do all the men not talk? Sure I understand its a matriarchal culture but thats no reason for men to act like drugged mules half the time. Cage basically tries to be the good guy and atone for his inability to save a little girl, however all the sorry and pity felt for the poor character is "really helped by the ending." *sarcasm* The basic moral of the story without giving away many spoilers is as follows. You live,something bad happens, crazy things keep happening, you become even sadder, then when you finally feel like the world around you can be changed, you realize feeling sorry for yourself is useless since you have your destiny in your hands...you die a horrible death involving bees, and the evil women from Hollywood satanism do a little happy dance around your corpse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, NOW I'm really confused You people can watch the new version of 'The Hills Have Eyes' and give that piece of cinematographic excrement 7 out of 10 points and now there are 3000+ people on IMDb saying in one voice that the new version of 'The Wicker Man' is a bad movie beyond any reason.What have I missed? Where was I when the world descended back to the dark ages?!? It seems that as soon as the plot of a movie goes beyond 'random people getting killed by evil monsters for 90 minutes but in the end a man with latex tights, calling himself Superman, will save the day' , people will get bored as in the movie has no potential because YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO FOLLOW A STORYLINE IN ORDER TO ENJOY IT! It seems that the only thing that the masses will get off on is complete and utter PORNOGRAPHY because it's the easiest and least resource-demanding product of entertainment. I ask you, what happened??? It has been going on for quite some time now. You can see it in all the new comedies, horror-movies and even action, thriller and (i'm crying when i say this) Drama for gods sake. Wherever you turn it's over-exaggeration of idiotic moments.I could have accepted a shining 5/10 score on a movie like 'The Hills Have Eyes' which carries absolutely nothing more than OLD NEWS, but for crying out loud, when people start badmouthing movies that are actually not bad at all - ....... I'm at a loss for words! Compared to the utter s*** that's been poring out of the US movie-scene recently this move should win an Oscar.I was going to give this movie 6/10 points after I had seen it but after I had seen 'The Wicker Man's' score here on IMDb I decided to give it 7/10. One extra for proving a point. Dear god people... read a book!PS- I'm confident most of you idiots don't even understand what I'm talking about because you're too busy eating Hamburgers..PPS- I appologise to every single person who shares my beliefs.

		<shortDescription>A turkey that didn't even deserve to go straight to video!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a great fan of the original film, I couldn't resist going along to compare this remake with it. I went with an open mind, despite the fact that I had read the reviews on this site which overwhelmingly rubbish the film. I'm afraid that very quickly I realised how true the comments/opinions were. This truly is a dreadful film. I was never a fan of Nicholas Cage, who has made a good living from movies, despite being particularly unattractive and having absolutely NO acting talent whatsoever. This turkey reinforces my opinions of him. I don't know what's happened to the man's face, but I just couldn't take my eyes off his peculiar appearance and it detracted from the film. The idea that an attractive young woman would be overcome by attraction to this weird looking individual is ludicrous. He looked more like the child's grandad than her father, as well as looking like Miss. Gulch from the Wizard of Oz as he rode his bike!!! His 'perfomance' is deeply embarrassing, as is that of the supporting cast. Ellen Burstyn really is diabolical - and I don't mean in the threatening sense!!! She appears to have taken actinglessons at the Nic Cage school of wooden!!!! I'm at a loss for words as to say how bad this film is. Anyone could be forgiven for wondering whether or not this film is meant to be tongue in cheek, with all the unintentional laughs. All copies of it and its negatives should be burned and the ashes scattered to the wind. A genuinely awful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply a bad film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen the original, and therefore I cannot compare the two. However, after only five minutes into this film, I knew it was a bomb. I watched the entire thing hoping that it would improve. It didn't. Every time I would get remotely interested in a character, they would no longer be developed, or would do exactly what I expected of them. Also, to me, there seemed to be so many props that were just there for show, and had nothing at all to do with plot development. In addition to this, the musical score was annoying. I believe that a suspense film cannot be made or ruined by it's musical score, but it can be made better or worse by it's score. This one was certainly made worse. Sadly, there is nothing good at all I can say about this film. I have no idea how someone of Ellen Burstyn's caliber became involved in this project. Pathetic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wickerman is one of the greatest British Horror films ever made. I think anyone who has seen the original would agree that its ironic humour, 3d characters and soundtrack all show a great understand of Pagan rituals and traditions. In the original Howie is shown as the Battle of religion, he is the Christian - Pure with virginity and Marital Values where as Willow is shown to represent the Pagan traditions of Freedom of Sexuality and Celebration.From the first time I heard that The Wickerman was being re-made I was open minded, Although remembering how badly recent Re-makes of films have been (Texas Chainsaw Masscre Anyone?) I was still Very uncertain.Last night me and My girlfriend went to watch the Remake of the Wickerman And i can honestly say it is One of the Worst films i Have ever seen.Watching Nic Cage strut around the screen playing his Usual Good Cop/Bad Cop droopy role nearly made me throw my popcorn up back into my mouth. I cannot believe the Legeacy of the film has been completely (excuse my french) Shat on by this remake. The first thing that is annoying is the American Setting. WTF?!?! Since when was a Remote Scottish Island an American Island in the state of Washington.There are no good points to this film. The acting is at best Woodern by all parties - Willow's character played by Kate Beahanis one of the worst on-screen roles i have ever watched. I cannot believe that someone with the Calibre of Ellen Burstyn even signed up for this project The film manages to metaphorically rape away the magic and suspense of the original and turn it into a hollow below average film. This is one film you should avoid this summer</fullReview>

The characters were undefined and just terrible. The script was awful (too much random HAHAHAHAHA from a mostly-female cast with 0 acting ability {except Leelee Sobieski, who I adore}). Throughout the film, Nick just runs around going "I'm an angry cop! GRRRRR!!!!". I love Nick Cage, but this movie does not do his acting justice. It's honestly awful. Do NOT see this film, whatever you do, even if you're as big a Nick fan as I am. It is full of plot holes and has no where near enough violence or even blood for it's genre. And it's NOT. SCARY.

		<shortDescription>Dull, mean, cheesy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie fails at almost every level. Our audience laughed at what was clearly meant to be serious dialog. The plot is fantastically implausible, both in general and in particulars, and so is Nicolas Cage's unconvincing and unsympathetic character. Kate Beahan's absurd bee-stung lips are the only memorable thing about her distracted performance, and the other female characters, including Ellen Burstyn's, are painted cardboard cutouts. The film is driven by fear and resentment. It tries to make us believe in imaginings that would embarrass any but the dullest and meanest of adolescent boys. A few plot ideas and images that might have turned interesting are simply dropped without any development. The closing credits brought groans, loud complaints, and scornful laughter. Although this is not the plot of the movie, I was reminded, while watching, of cartoon mysteries in which crooks dress up as monsters to frighten "meddling kids." That's the level of cheesy implausibility we're dealing with here. Even viewers who actively suspend their disbelief will be dissatisfied, and will probably feel as cheated as I did.</fullReview>

The plot line was very interestingly done and it was definitely an innovative take on the ideas expressed. The ending was not expected (though left some plot holes) and I could really relate to Cage's character.There were a lot of unanswered questions, but that, contrary to what most people say, is not a flaw. The loose plot ends are the beauty of this movie. Sure, it gets a little repetitive but the story is very intensely put together with character development and the emotions expressed throughout truly made this movie.Of course, it was not without its flaws. As I said, the scenes became a little repetitive, and some bits were unintentionally funny. Some bits you have to be as clever as me to actually understand, and so I would only recommend this film to people who truly appreciate things (which, I'm sorry to say, is not the majority of the movie-going public).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fortunately for me, I didn't see the original 1973 version, so I was not burdened by undue expectations upon entering the theater. I am giving this film a 7, although just barely, perhaps 6.5 would be more fair. Like most films these days, yes, the plot is flimsy and it requires an extra dose of suspended disbelief.But I enjoyed it because it held my interest completely for the whole 2 hours. It built up the suspense very nicely. It was a who-dunnit mystery that turned out not to be such a mystery after all. I did see it coming, but not from afar, as is the case in most movies. If you think this plot is transparent, then go see the Illusionist: no illusion there(but I still liked it).Fabulous scenery, good mystery, loads of suspense. AND very, very creepy. Plus lots of good, silly laughs, which I think is a good thing in a mystery/suspense/horror-lite film. Throw in some very sexy performances by Kate Beahan, and Leelee Sobieski and you have a winner as far as I am concerned!! It is a very typical Nick Cage performance. He honed his on-screen persona by the time he was in "Leaving LasVegas," and it hasn't varied much since then, which is bad or good depending on how well you like it. As usual, he is manly, impassioned,and valiant, yet confused, full of self-doubt, and vulnerable. I have to say that this wasn't one of his best performances, but the script had a lot to do with that. Very weak dialogue. They should have hired me to brush it up ;) When he delivered the line, "Step back from the bike!" I must confess I was taken aback. There are a lot of actors who would have ad-libbed something more appropriate there, or just outright refused to say it. I wonder what Brando would have done? Probably just mumbled something incoherent. At the risk of being arrested as a security threat, I have to say that I, nevertheless, enjoyed this Cage performance far more than his "World Trade Center" performance. Now that was really painful!So, it was just a beautiful movie to watch,and good escapist entertainment. A pleasant way to pass the time. You really can't expect every film to be a masterpiece.For those numerous reviewers, who said "Worst movie I ever saw," I say, check the current theater listings: "Accepted," "Beerfest," "Material Girls," "Idlewild," "Trust the Man," "Snakes on a Plane," "How to Eat Fried Worms," "Factotum," "Invincible," "The Barnyard," and "Lady in the Water." Not a single one in the bunch is better than Wicker Man, and most of them are far worse. Worst movie, ever? Not even the worst this week, not by a long shot! Get real!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wicker Man, The (2006) ** (out of 4) Earlier in the year I gave a glowing review of the original film where I also stated that I think the film could be well made with the religious views being updated to today's times. Well, I finally viewed the remake and it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be. As I suspected, the religious aspect of the original film is taken out but if you've seen that movie then you aren't going to be too shocked about anything that happens here. A cop (Nicolas Cage) travels to upper Washington when he receives a letter from an ex saying that her daughter is missing. Once arriving in the small village, the cop soon begins to realize that there's a lot more going on than just a missing person's case. As I said, if you've seen the original then you're not going to see anything new here but I suspect that if you didn't see the original then you might enjoy this as it stays close to the mystery of the original. The ending here packs a nice little punch and manages to be disturbing so this is no doubt the best part of the film. Everything leading up to the ending is decent but again, there's no room for any suspense since I already knew what was going on. Cage has proved to be a great actor but he's also proved to sleepwalk through a few roles. This here is a so-so performance as he does good in certain scenes but in others he's just too bland. Either way, no matter what type of performance he gives he always manages to be somewhat entertaining. Ellen Burstyn takes over the Christopher Lee role and actually gives a very good performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i went to see this i really didn't know what to expect. I hadnt seen the original but I'm also aware that remakes are seldom any good. This film starts well with the opening car wreck. Nicolas Cage portrays a fairly average but often believable character throughout this movie. For people who haven't seen this movie, you may well enjoy this as you don't really see the end coming by cage being tricked by all the women. The only quibble i had was that in the trailer it shows cage with his head in a tank full of bees, which was supposed to be part of cages 'pre burning' routine but only surfaced in the form of sound in the final cut. I have since watched the original and didn't spoil my enjoyment of either film. There are many differences, not least in the form of hippies vs women and there is no nudity in this film and possibly the lack of britt ecklund, but all in all i came out of this having got my moneys worth. I would point out that any men with feminist girlfriends as mine is, will probably enjoy this as they did hard candy.</fullReview>

Every single scene was absolutely ridiculous. The best scene, though was the one where Nick was wearing the bear costume. Then he blasted that woman directly in the face and all you see is him triumphantly standing over her while she's rolling down the hill. Another great thing about the movie was how it kept showing the little girl unexpectedly getting plowed by that car (On the boat, in Nick's dreams, etc.). But the best thing about the movie has to be the fact that it was trying to be completely serious. I'll repeat. IT WAS TRYING TO BE A SERIOUS MOVIE!!!. What was Neil LaBute thinking? Honestly, what in the world could have been going through his mind in making this atrocity of a film? He'll never be able to live this down. Nicholas Cage will never be able to live this down. Never. This movie is just a gigantic practical joke on all of us, if anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I really hate Hollywood! When are they going to stop taking everyone else's films and making them God awful?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First The Ring, then The Italian Job, then The Grudge... now The Wicker Man! When I first saw the trailer for this film, I honestly thought it was a joke. I mean, who would be so stupid as to try and remake a brilliant classic horror like The Wicker Man? Well, it turns out they really weren't joking, but I wish they had have been! There are certain films that no one should ever remake. The Wicker Man is one of them. I thought, however, this film would be much like The Omen remake and would be a word for word replica of the original, which would not be as bad, but may just invite a new generation of younger cinema goers to watch the original film, which in 99% of the time, is better than the remake. Wrong! They changed almost the entire story, with the island mainly being run by women, under the leadership of Sister Summersisle. Where did Christopher Lee's character go? Everybody knows that Lord Summerisle is the best character in the original! And what were they thinking casting Nicolas Cage in the part that is unbelievably similar to Edward Woodward's? Nicolas, you're not a great actor at the best of times. Maybe you should just keep to films where you can just pout and display no discernible acting skills whatsoever? I think that would be best for all.I've heard some people describe this as a sequel, rather than a remake. To those of you that are thinking that, why make a film that is similar to the original in far too many ways to be distinguishable from it? If this is indeed what the filmmakers where thinking, they should step aside, and allow writers with actual talent to write screenplays from now on.Honestly, this film is just a 100 minute waste of your life, and if you are a true fan of the original, you'll just leave the cinema feeling cheated and sick to you stomach.And just a quick suggestion to the people who made this film, and indeed, to Hollywood in general, if you have run out of ideas, stop making films. Don't just take other people's films and remake them into horrible monstrosities and try to pass them off as films. Its not working!</fullReview>

Overall it felt like a twilight zone episode.if you are hesitant to see it bc of bad reviews you cant go wrong seeing it for a reduced price early in the day.an "R" rating would have benefited this film greatly however.Many of the children look similar, which makes sense, but I got the feeling that the script may have had a different plot in mind and then changed gears after filming started....I haven't seen the original so perhaps this is an incorrect assumption.

		<fullReview>I find most of the comments here are more disturbing than the movie itself. Viewers are pretty much "angry" and some even want to "punch a baby" The truth is, without seeing the so-called original one, I find The Wicker Man is quite interesting, not in a way of horror, but in a way of mystery. The opening is done pretty good to build up the suspense you need to hang on with. A bizarre accident event, followed by a letter from ex-girlfriend, draws the police officer Malus into a potential case of kidnapping; a little girl is at stake. The plot sounds good to me as I was brought up by The X-files, though there is no paranormal activities involved except Malus has vision and nightmare about weird things, and "trust no one" thing... And the bear costume thing that people laugh about, it is really nothing serious cos you would find it in stadiums so why not in a celebration event taken place in a movie? Do not let other people's rage to cloud your judgment, this is a good movie with decent acting at work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked out of this movie. The opening sequence was promising. A sense of place is created with the help of some beautiful cinematography. The main character is intriguing, and a shocking event up front of the titles leaves one with high expectations.Unfortunately, it is all downhill from there up to the point I walked out, and I can only presume it continued on that trajectory.It was filled with one cliché after another. Every scene gave me a sense of deja V. It had either been on one episode of the X-Files or another, or one of those bad TV movies-of-the-week. Although one source was a little classier than TV: the director image-checked Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now, with a ghostly figure fleeing across different levels, leading to a scene with a menacing red-cloaked figure in a claustrophobic setting! As IF, LaBute!! The pace was slow, the acting was oddly bad, and the whole thing struck me as preposterous and ridiculous! And it isn't one bit scary. Maybe the second half of the movie improved, but I couldn't take that chance! I cut my losses and split.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Abhorrent horror remake provokes far more laughter than scares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neil LaBute's re-imagining of the 1973 classic horror serves as just another representation of horror remakes falling deeply interior in their original outing, with scares that more often than provoke unintentional laughter than spine chills; and not in an effective way incorporated in comedy-horror hybrids. The film never rises at the surface level of the cinematically inept, and instead relies heavily on a poorly executed plot and a script that falls shallow of nuance but feels sorely miscalculated at the point of leaving the average scratching their head pondering "What was director LaBute thinking?". And a laughably incompetent performance uprooted by Nicolas Cage certainly doesn't do much justice. So this film follows Seattle police officer Edward Malus (played by Nicolas Cage) recovering from an horrendous when he is informed by his ex-wife Willow Woodard (played by Kate Beahan) that her daughter Rowan has gone missing. This lead Edward on the investigation to a mysterious island for the missing girl, but discovers the island inhabited by individuals of a mysterious paganistic cult lead by Sister Summersisle (played by Ellen Burstyn) who apparently represents the goddess. Upon learning the nefarious dangers of the cult, Edward must discover the terrifying their terrifying secret and save the little girl from the sinister cult.After sitting through an hour of this, I honestly could have not tell if this film was supposed to be dark comedy or just a poorly conceived supernatural horror flick. Though it supposedly falls in the latter category, it really makes you wonder if its possible the movie suffers from a identity crisis. Why is this? The poster showing a terrifying, Exorcist-like image of the little girl leads you to believe you're for a spine-chilling thriller, but Neil LaBute's misguided direction proves otherwise. As the film deals with the lead character investigating an island influenced by paganism, and practice human sacrifices for reasons vaguably explained. The idea would be interesting enough if the story actually took the time to vividly explain some of the concepts other than occasional commentary on the Salem Witch Trials, or maybe if the plot made much sense before descending into a misguided mess. While the first film put religious conflict as the central theme of it's plot, this installment replaces the theme with women rebelling against men which frankly fails work here. The idea is is profoundly interesting on paper but when Neil LaBute's translates it on screen, it results in 102-minutes of unintentional comedy and lack of scares. From there on, we are forced to endure a plot that not only grows silly before the first hour, but also an over-the-top performance by Nicolas Cage who's scenes of hollering at Kate Beahan are painfully unconvincing, and scenes of his character being threatened by a crowd of pagans, that don't even amount to the slightest suspense. And it doesn't certainly doesn't help that his character is poorly drawn, engages in cheesy, and takes a hateful audacity of hitting women in multiple scenes. The Wicker Man is sorely incompetent remake of the 1973 horror classic with nothing to offer but a sheer lack of authenticity and scares. This film is laughably bad to the point of only being worth enjoying on a guilty pleasure level. But if you are looking for a good horror film with good scares and plenty of smarts, you are probably best looking further. For a list of the worst movies of 2006, this one definitely fills in a position.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you saw the original, you know how pathetic this is in comparison. But even if you didn't, you would think this is putrid. I know nothing about film making, yet I could do better than this. Some may say that it's not fair to compare a remake to an original, but how can you not? Let's get the comparisons under way. The original had a soundtrack so memorable, that I still think of it decades after hearing it. The religious juxtaposition of a devout Christian virgin opposite a bunch of island pagans, made for dynamic drama. Also, there was the song of the temptress and the May Pole dance, etc. This version had none of that.But what really ruins this film is the inability to create an eerie atmosphere, and the lack of urgency in Cage, although I love him as a personality in other films. Shouting and cursing cannot convey alone, the true shock and horror a person feels in a given situation. It requires good acting. Cage is a personality, not an actor. This was the wrong role for him. You could feel the intensity and outrage of the lead actor in the original version. That's what made the film.Let's not forget the larger than life persona of Christopher Lee, Lord Summerisle in the original. Ellen Burstyn looked like she was doing this while waiting for her laundry to dry. In the original you could see that Lord Summerisle and the locals loved their culture. Beyond the sacrifice aspect, they just genuinely enjoyed being Celtic pagans. In this one they looked bored and cynical.But even without comparing the old and new, this one falls flat, and most of the fault lies with Cage's performance. Of course the whole movie hinges on the last scene. He was so awkward and struggling so hard to portray a sense of desperation, but I wasn't buying it.Back to comparisons. The song of the swaying villagers while the Wicker Man burned in the original put the icing on the cake of that masterpiece. A bunch of weirdoes chanting that something must die didn't do if for me here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ellen Burstyn and Nicolas Cage must have really needed a payday. This is, by far, one of the worst movies I've seen in a very long time. Cage came closest to "acting", despite being given nothing to work with, but he looked like he was begging for help through the whole thing, wanting someone, anyone, to please start acting along with him. Burstyn should just be embarrassed.There are no redeeming qualities to this movie - none. The story is hokey, at best. The acting is pathetic. This doesn't even look like a decent independent movie. The music score was horrible and didn't come close to fitting the movie, ever.Ugh - shame on you, Nicolas Cage. I usually like your work, but this was garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I begin, there are a lot of references to how bad this movie is. Usually this focuses on Nicholas Cage with the bees, dressing as a bear, hitting women in the face, and yelling a few goofy lines.If one were to see all the reviews, you'd think this is a massive train wreck. The reality is, it isn't a train wreck nor is it a good movie.The beginning works well enough. It's an interesting idea that a man witnesses the death of a woman and her child. This tragedy leads him to be obsessive about finding a missing girl. That's a really good start. The problem is that once he gets to the island, everything falls apart. All the mystery is lost by moments where they focus on how weird everything is. The sets, the costumes, the acting, and the story all pull us away from the story of a man looking for a missing girl. That's when we get Nicholas Cage pointing a gun at a woman so he can steal her bicycle. In the end, all you can do is think that the movie is absurd and laugh. Had they focused on the mystery of the missing girl, the movie could have led him to the same fate. The townspeople could easily have seemed helpful and interested in finding the girl. It would have added to the impact of the reveal in the end.This movie isn't what haters and critics make it seem, but it's not good either. It's too bad that they squandered what was a great setup in order to focus on presenting a weird cult. Had we not thought of the residents of the island as strange and dangerous, the audience would have felt more for he film.</fullReview>

I have actually re-watched "Manos" a few times for its unintentional humor. I watched "The Wicker Man" just once and definitely found it less watchable than "Manos." At least "Manos" could be forgiven for being completely produced by amateurs. "Wicker Man" can't use that excuse. I have a few other high-production value films that I give horrible ratings for simply because, in the end, they don't rise above the level "Manos" and other films like it.Oddly enough, I generally like Nick Cage. I have enjoyed a lot of his films. I don't think he performed any better or worse than normal. This film's problem came from over-rating the value of the script. There are just some things that shouldn't be committed to film regardless of production values. "Wicker Man" was one such film. Cinema Sins wasn't nearly as kind to it as I would have been, and yet they ripped so many new ones only "new ones" were all that was left.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wicker Man -- an unbiased review.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>May not be described here as enthusiastically bad as other reviews suggest but still this is a pretty awful movie.Honestly I have never heard of the 1973 original before this came out although I remember being uninterested in this one during its theatrical release. Given the "hilariocity" reviews for it, I finally decided to check it out and form my own opinion of it. What do I think? Well it's rather boring and very forgettable. The first scene when Nicolas Cage goes through the self-help books really has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. After he pulls a driver over to the side of a road in a station wagon, there is a little girl in the backseat who throws a stuffed animal out the window a few times. The last time he picks it up on the other side of the road, a speeding truck comes down and smashes into them. The vehicle is on fire as he tries to rescue the girl but doesn't. The whole thing blows up and throws him to the other side of the road. Being obviously disturbed by what happened, he finally decides to investigate the possible disappearance after receiving a letter from his ex-girlfriend about their missing daughter. Strange things suddenly begin to happen. For a creepy village far away from civilization where phones don't seem to work and the inhabitants are basically anti technology and anti progressive, why would they have a website? In all fairness though, it does make sense why he dons the bear suit towards the end -- it's to help save the little girl he was searching for all that time. Probably the most shocking scene is the short fight scene between Cage and Leelee Sobieski. It is almost unbelievable the cast agreed to do this, I mean especially Ellen Burstyn. What eventually happens is they basically set him up in the commune. The whole thing is a trick for them to burn him in the end. It just isn't very effective overall. While watching it however, and being familiar with Neil LaBute's earlier work, there seems to be a common thread, which are stories in some way pitting a man against a woman, so in that regard I suppose it makes sense he'd do something like this. Still, he lost any kind of credibility as a filmmaker when this came out. It was also the beginning of the end for Nicolas Cage's career. Although he starred in Ghost Rider the following year, not many people liked it even though many were anticipating it. The decline continued, and now he stars in movies that don't even make theatrical release. He's a fine actor, but his career was in trouble as the result of this movie. The only thing worth noting is there are a lot of Nicolas Cage's freak outs here. Other than that, there's really nothing going for it. There's no weight to it, nothing emotional or thought-provoking about it. It isn't even anything close to being scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "The Wicker Man" remake along with the 1973 original with a friend of mine about 2 months ago. We were both curious about the movies for quite some time. My only preliminary exposure to this specimen was the infamous "Not the bees!" scene, though that particular sample wasn't my motivation for looking into these films. Though I have seen the original prior to watching the remake, I analyzed, dissected and rated the 2006 remake on it's own merits, keeping in mind only the general setting and idea, which were the basis for the 1973 classic.The original "Wicker Man" portrayed a variety of conflicts and problems (perhaps too large a variety) through the main opposition of Christianity vs. Paganism. It was, without a doubt, an interesting and well crafted piece of art, though it did have some minor pacing issues and suffered from a slight inability to properly develop the different aspects of the conflict due to it's relatively short run time. From what I could gather, a lot of people were opposed to the very idea of a "Wicker Man" remake. Personally, I thought it was a prospect ripe for development, as the original presented a wide variety of ideas and allowed a lot freedom to potential re-interpretation. It was, in the truest sense of the word, a timeless movie, one that could take new forms in the works of other directors/writers through the ages, if not as a direct remake, at least as a general inspiration.The location, a sort of occult backwater, was ideal for the story's development and choosing to (more or less) keep it similar was one of LaBute's better decisions when it comes to this movie.While a conflict of the genders isn't the first thing that comes to mind when I think of "The Wicker Man" it was a fairly interesting concept. Although I haven't seen any of Mr.LaBute's other works, from what I can gather, this kind of conflict is a recurring theme in them. Again, I didn't mind this direction, It's Neil LaBute's remake, after all. He has the freedom to re-interpret it as he wishes. That doesn't excuse the poor presentation, though.One thing that becomes noticeable after the first couple of scenes is the direction, or lack thereof. A lot of people flag the acting in this movie as "bad", though I think directionless would be more appropriate. I'm pretty sure some of the actors, especially Nick Cage, could do better if they knew what they were supposed to do. What character are they supposed to represent - no one knows. What feelings are they trying to convey - not quite sure. This lack of direction gives the scenes an awkward, poorly paced feel. As a result, the movie seems to waste most of it's 102 minute run time, feeling a lot less complete than the shorter 1973 original by the end.The connection between the scenes themselves seems off too. The whole movie feels poorly cobbled together as a result, which is a shame, as some scenes are done rather well, especially when it comes to scenery and camera work. There are some rather poor computer generated effects in some select moments (the bees come to mind, though that scene wasn't in most cuts). The island in particular feels very authentic and manages to pull of the occult backwater in the 21st century look.The whole man vs. woman focus also suffers from lack of direction. They try to present Cage's character as a tormented man who wants to right wrongs, but is a complete control freak and even a borderline sociopath as a result of his past failures. At least I thinks that's what they're trying to go for - with all the awkward dream sequences and conversations where Cage steals the spotlight you never get an idea of what his character is supposed to be like. And if Nick gets 1/3 of the movie for himself and still can't portray his character, you can imagine what the rest of the island dwellers are like. So, if there is no foundation to what the characters who participate in the conflict represent, then the conflict itself can't be outlined. As a result all the elements clearly made to tie into this conflict (the hive metaphor, the Don Quixote reference) feel tacked on and pointless, nothing more than pretentious self-indulgence.In conclusion, "The Wicker Man" remake offers an interesting take on the original concept coupled with a wonderful setting, but fails to develop it. The poor directing and editing between scenes, the resulting slow pacing and plot holes, the poorly developed characters and directionless acting and most of all the poorly outlined conflict ruin what could have been an interesting movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wicker Man (2006): Dir: Neil LaBute / Cast: Nicolas Cage, Ellen Burstyn, Leelee Sobieski, Molly Parker, Kate Beahan: Who in hell is the bloody Wicker Man? Apparently these moron villagers with no life worship this guy yet he is nowhere to be seen. They could bow down to an outhouse and it would make about as much sense. It opens with a cop, played by Nicolas Cage failing to rescue a mother and daughter inside a car that explodes. Central plot regards a letter from a past girlfriend who claims that their daughter is missing. He goes to a remote village only to discover that everybody worships bees. Directed by Neil LaBute who previously made the much better Nurse Betty. The screenplay here has a conclusion that demanded a happy ending like no other. Cage does well as the no nonsense cop out for answers but his fate is nothing to write home about. Ellen Burstyn is laughable as the bee queen who constantly talks spirit bullshit. Leelee Sobieski plays a deranged bitch who has bees honey for brains. Molly Parker plays a school teacher who is obviously guilty because she lies every time she opens her mouth to Cage. Kate Beahan plays another bee loving crazy honey bitch that should be put away. Beautiful production doesn't bypass that it could have been about the reality of cults. Instead the audience laughed and snickered at its ridiculous bee hive charade. Score: 4 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quick reminder/suggestion: I'll spoilers in this comment, so don't read it, if you haven't watched the movie. I'll also be talking about the original 70s movie.This movie has taken over some flaws of the original, but tried to eliminate a few too. But I'll start with a change in the script that I liked, although it kind of freaked me a out a little bit too.The whole island is like a bee colony mixed in with a black widow ingredient. The women have the power and the men are plain workers. But while as a male companion to the black widow you at least get to have fun (i.e. intercourse with the female), before she kills you, the men on this island don't really get to enjoy this part! Not that it is shown on-screen/directly, but you can guess every time you see this men.While this is a major change, most of the things the original had, are included here as well. The why doesn't he try to escape his cage at the end is taken care of here: Because he can't, his legs are broken! In the alternate cut/ending this is also shown, but was cut for the theatrical version to give it a PG-13. In the theatrical version you overheard this happening.One of the major flaws of this remake to me, is that it over explains things. Especially at the end, when all is clear, but they talk about it.It's a good cast overall, but you're not left satisfied after watching this movie :o)</fullReview>

To be fair it really depends on what you look for in a film. Not everything you see is going to be something you'd want to own on DVD and not everything is going to be inspiring. It passed a couple of hours and I wasn't bored so that's good enough for me.However, the lass that played the ex-love interest (forgot her name, that's how good she was) was irritating at best. Nicholas Cage has never been great but we all tend to just put up and shut up in order to get over it.All in all it's a decent story and good for those who never saw the original and would never have seen either version had this not been made.It kept me gripped enough to feel like I'd had an enjoyable visit to the cinema.The major criticism I have of it is that it is a scary story but a wimpy version. The tension and fear should have been cranked up and made this at least a 15.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone contemplating remaking a classic movie should watch this mess. Sometimes you can just tell when actors are appearing for the pay check. Nicolas Gage appearing in This remake of "The Wicker Man" is one such example.Plot In A Paragraph: Policeman Edward Malus receives a letter from his former fiancée Willow, who left him years ago, telling that her daughter Rowan is missing. Edward travels to the private island of Summerisle, where Willow lives and she reveals that Rowan is actually their daughter. During his investigation with the hostile and unhelpful locals, Edward discloses that the locals are pagans, practising old rituals to improve their harvest, and Rowan is probably alive and being prepared to be sacrificed. Cage sleepwalks through this, and does not appear to be interested in what he is doing at all, so why should the audience?? The supporting cast are all poor and I was disappointed to see Leelee Sobieski in this, and truthfully she was the best thing in this mess. In the three years prior to this, she had only appeared in 3 episodes of a TV mini series and had a role in a TV movie. So I'm guessing she was grabbing what ever work she could. But she deserves better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Worst Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie cannot be taken seriously in order to enjoy it. I think i saw it in theaters, and spent the whole time bawling from laughter. It was so bad it made laugh so hard. I am a female, and in no way support domestic violence, but the fact that whoever made this movie thought it was okay for Mr. Cage to brawl with females was so messed up one can't help but laugh. There are lots of bad movies people guiltily admit to liking, and this is one of them for me. Surprisingly, I know other people that completely agree with me, and laughed throughout the whole movie. Don't go out of your way to see this, but if it's one and you feel like laughing at something awful, this is it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly as bad as everyone says, which is a big problem in its own right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake of the classic British film The Wicker Man has in its own right become something of a cult favorite. This is because many find it to be a so-bad-it's-good type of film. I don't see it. Honestly, it's mostly competently made, and the story remains pretty good. And the one big twist of the remake, that Summersisle is populated by a matriarchal cult of beekeepers, is not too bad, though it's certainly more than a little misogynistic. If I had never seen the original, I might call it passable entertainment. Compared to the original, though, it's pretty weak. It's slowly paced, and it makes an especially huge mistake of entering the protagonist's dreamworld every ten minutes or so. It also doesn't help that the cast is as lethargic as the pacing. Nick Cage, whom I was told was at his craziest in this film, actually tries to keep calm through most of the movie. Ellen Burstyn is a fine actress, but she seems not to believe in the project and is just plain bland as Lady Summersisle. The lead actress, Kate Beahan, is cute but seems constantly stoned. Her eyes are even red most of the time. When it nears the end, around the time when Cage starts busting down all the doors (as Edward Woodward did in the original), it starts to earn its reputation for lunacy. The film is almost worth watching just to see Cage coldcock a few women. The first time it's so unexpected that I laughed out loud. He also beats the living crap out of Leelee Sobieski, which is great. And he dresses in a bear suit and gets covered with bees. Those are the highlights. You can see them on Youtube.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>where civilization is totally lost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly,I know this is a remake,and I'm pretty clear of the fact that usually a remake cannot match its original counterpart,particularly this film,whose original version got a high score while the remake got mere 3.5,surprisingly.I haven't watched the original myself,so what I can do is just make comments on this one,and to be frank,it's surely underrated here.In terms of the visual languages,its downside happens to be its upside.Known as a thriller,this film is neither shot in dark lighting nor filled with particularly horrified scores/sounds,nevertheless,the whole atmosphere is odd,unnatural and rather enigmatic,even if for most of the screen time,it is daylight that occupies.Also I wanna give credit to the props&amp;make-up crews for the masks and costumes appearing in this film are impressive,making those odd residents appear more freakish.The acting of Cage is fine but not particularly outstanding.Compared with Cage,other people's acting is forgettable.What interests me the most,however,is the theme of this film.The ending(which is another highlight of this film due to its unconventionality)reveals that the whole 'issue' is totally a set-up and the only victim is Edward himself.But the interesting thing is,he is chosen not only because he has a blood bond with one of the local resident(Willow) which according to the sisters,could guarantee a better harvest,but also his male identity,as the Summer Isle is actually a female society and "drones must die".Note how Rose teaches her students that the ultimate representation of male is phallus,which indicates that men are only used for breeding.Therefore,the death of Edward is inevitable.The especially evil thing about this film is that it alarms people how far humans can go with the total blindness of their belief-it is where murder is not murder,but part of legitimate ritual;it is where civilization is totally lost and kids turn out to be demons.Or maybe,the trick of this film is,if we stand aside,charging their belief as insane,we will be dismissed as "patronizing",as self-acclaimed cultured people? Thinking about all those old religions(e.g.voodoo,shamanism)existing today,how is it possible that cannibalism for one society could be 'normal' custom for another?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that this movie was decent, however, i think that most of the changes made from the original were simply for the sake of change, to justify the remake (i.e. honey instead of apples)Also, the dream sequences/psychosis/hallucination thing seems a little ridiculous, considering it is hardly explained and the only purpose it serves is to allow some creepy bee special effects to be added. I was expecting a little more light to be shed on the paranormal powers that existed, which is where i thought the visions would be coming from, but no, it was just left a loose end. Also, the old woman is clearly depicted as having some kind of power, yet this is also left wide open.All in all, i think they have tried to add an extra dimension to the film with the changes they have made, however they did not follow through with it, left a whole bunch of loose ends hanging, resulting in what could have been some interesting depth coming across as superficial changes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>somewhat confused, non-scary horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most entertaining thing in this film was Nicholas Cage having a fist fight with Leelee Sobieski. Yes, it was that bad. If you're looking for, sex, there's no sex. If you're looking for violence, there's not much. If you're looking for horror, well, there is a little, but it's not very well done. No gore. A car does blow up in it. As far as all the artsy theatre stuff goes, the plot is stupid, the acting is mostly awful, and the dialog has been thoroughly cleansed of any wit or intellectual content. Even the camera work looks like it was made for TV.The big problem with this movie is that they started out from original film's screenplay, and then they scrubbed out all the Christianity, all the sexual tension, and all the weird creepy/corny stuff. The thing is the original was all about the cultural conflict between starched-collar conservative Christianity and corny/creepy free-loving hippie pagans. It's like remaking Star Wars but replacing the Empire with killer bees. I think they were trying to make sure that nobody could be offended by it, except for the audience. Possibly the update in the setting could have worked with a complete rewrite, but what happened was that the screenplay and the direction/production are for totally different films. The film just doesn't know where it's going and it sure never gets there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nice Attempt At A Remake, Except For the Complete Failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please be aware, this review contains spoilers.A detective (Nicolas Cage) goes to Summer's Isle to look for a girl named Rowan at the request of a former girlfriend named Willow. But he is instead met by an island of women who dominate the men and sacrifice girls at an altar of fire to help their crops grow.I enjoyed the acting of Ellen Burstyn (who plays Christopher Lee's role as Summerisle), though I was disappointed in the casting choice. I would have preferred an older horror actress, or even better someone from the original film. Burstyn makes a great matriarchal figure, but doesn't really have the credentials for the role she was cast in. (I should also briefly note Nicholas Cage is not a horror actor... and his acting here is splotchy and uneven, to say the least.) Neil LaBute directs, after being best known for "Nurse Betty". I've read the novella "The Shape of Things" by LaBute, as well, and don't see how LaBute got this project. What about these past projects says "you're the guy to remake an English horror classic"? Here's where the spoilers come in: As a film by itself, the movie was weak, but as a remake it was completely worthless. It was as if you took a great novel written on the college level and gutted it for 10-year olds. But did it in such a way that even the kids' intelligence is insulted. I have four primary concerns.First, the replacement of the pagan religion with the women-dominated society. This sanitized the brilliant dichotomy of Christianity and paganism from the original, getting rid of the most thought provoking aspects. The all female society thing has been overdone (how many times has "Star Trek" done this?).Along with this, the original made Christianity get called into doubt and made the islanders seem innocent. Here, we are confronted by people who outright murder and burn people... so even though Cage comes across as a jerk, the islanders are clear villains. This completely reverses the greatest dimension of the first film.Third, the Willow character is completely stupid and extraneous. In the original, we were given a little piece at a time of the Rowan mystery. This made the film very enjoyable for the viewer. But in the remake, this Willow character shows up at random times to explain the plot to Cage (and us), making most of the mystery shallow or completely removed.And finally, the death of Cage is utterly stupid nonsense. In the original, the detective is a Christian and his faith is tested for a couple days to make sure he is pure for sacrifice. In the new one, there is no purity or any hint of religiousness. All they require is a link to the island. So, my question is this: why did they give him the run-around instead of just knocking him unconscious in the first place? He was not tested, and the lies were pointless... making the entire film utter bull.Can you tell I didn't care for this film? As a piece of entertainment, it serves a purpose. But it's poorly written, not expertly acted... and a great insult to the viewer and the original film. I wouldn't let anyone watch this, not even to compare to the original... it's just not worth the time.</fullReview>

Since so much time was left, I was expecting a plane of FBI agents to come swooping in or something, anything else.

If you do see, prepare for a very unhappy ending.there is a time and place for an ending like that. the reason it was no good is simple: if i read a short story that ended like this, i would say, "Good tale! kind of pointless, but OK, a story of horror/evil of mankind." if i read a novel that had a sympathetic character like that die so meaninglessly i would be angry. now if they die for a thematic reason, that is one thing. but ed/nicks death is meaningless. it does not take a 2 hour setup to show that life is cruel or bad.if i am watching an independent film, i am less prone to demand some sort of meaning or payoff. nihilism, the cruelty of people, stupid religions, etc are all good themes. but not in this movie.this movie has no payoff. the ending is a turnoff. if i am watching a tales of the crypt movie i know to expect. but part of the tale telling of tales of the crypt is that a skeleton with bad jokes tells you a horror tale. so if it is graphic or if it is unjust, you knew that.a good storyteller would not take that long to weave such a nothing little tale. this would be also OK as a twilight zone episode. only 30 minutes, and sometimes twilight zone got dark. i paid 3.99 and i want my money back.if ed had been a willing sacrifice, it could have been cool. but what is the point of an island full of evil crazies who entrap and kill one man for their own needs? even if those crazed pagans had to kill him, their smugness and joy at his death was annoying. yes, there are people like that. yes, some tribal groups do that. yes, people in America used to love lynchings. does not mean i want to see it.this movie was emotional smut. and that is no good. i like real real smut sometimes. but some people don't. so if you try and sell a movie that is actually dirty pictures with naked people, but convince people who don't like that to see it, don't be surprised if they get upset.i kept thinking: somehow, someway, he either won't die, or there will be a meaning to his death.watching this movie was like watching a lynching of an innocent man. who wants to watch that?

		<fullReview>I rented this title from the local library over the weekend for free. I like Nicholas Cage so I figured it had to be somewhat entertaining. It wasn't. It was full of B-movie stunts, like loud music and chanting preceeding a dangerous moment for the main character, which didn't add to story telling but got predictable and grating. I couldn't get sucked into this movie as I spent the entire time being annoyed by the soundtrack or trying to guess why the actors looked so...well, like they had wicker shoved up their ***. With such stilted acting I couldn't feel any compassion for the characters and didn't really care about the huge betrayal in the end. I was just glad it happened because it meant the end of the film was near. Please don't get me wrong, I love B-movies, it is how I like to spend a rainy afternoon. I like most of the remakes in their own rights not in comparison. I loved that it was filmed where I grew up at. I liked all the actors of this film (in other films). Yet this movie still somehow managed to suck enormously. Skip it unless you are REALLY bored or a die hard Cage fan.</fullReview>

The island is named the same except in a different location and instead of pagan worshippers we get a cult that seems to keep bees and act like a colony of bees. The women seem to be dominant on the island while the men work and cannot speak.The plot is basically about a cop going onto the island looking for a lost girl that turns out to be his daughter, it seems he as an allergy to bees and that must suck since the island is full of them.He soon starts to believe that they want to sacrifice her to The Wicker Man but really it's him since they believe that if he gets burnt the bees will produce honey again.Although it doesn't have a strong plot The Wicker Man does have some memorable moments such as the bees being poured all over Nicholas Cage's character. The Wicker Man remake is entertainingly bad and funny for all the wrong reasons, the original version is obviously superior. Try the remake out but don't expect a lot. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if buy halfway through the movie your mind is already moved on to something else like dinner or if you made sure to turn off your headlights when you parked, this is your movie! it was practically a tale of two halves with the only consistent tone being poor directed. The story as it plays out is actually quite entertaining, as your trying to piece the mystery together with the lead character. However when you are shown random shots of random objects you are sort of forced to already foresee what will happen for the most part.*spoiler warning* I mean come on how about the early scene when he killed a bee and mentioned he was allergic? and when he unpacked his items and we were shown his bee sting survival kit. All these things were very shoved down our throats if even for contextual rather then foreshadowing keys *end spoiler* But after what was becoming an inviting tale and building on suspense, the film suddenly plummets with random events that never really come together to relate to any other manner of the story. After this drop where you have to question what the movie is doing and where it is suddenly trying to go, it tries, though feebly to pick up the pace one more at least upping the tempo and trying to get the audience to reach some conclusion.....the end result is a non climatic twist drawn out and unneeded to the point i had actually wished i stopped the movie about 12 minutes before the end credits came up.In short they took a great classic, took an incredible cast, and even a good concept, and failed to deliver. It seems like a third grade book report you started at first, and then put off until it was due,maybe reading a few cliff notes; and here the directer was still trying for a passing grade writing the book report on the bus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into watching this film, I had seen the 1973 version, and I'd read a lot (a whole lot) of disparaging comments about this one. Most of these negative comments were from devotees of the original version, rather than an unbiased criticism of the film by itself.As most know, this film involves a cop who is summoned to an island named for its administrator, Summersisle, to investigate the missing child of his ex-fiancée. He runs into road block after road block among the island's inhabitants which, understandably, frustrates him to no end.As a stand alone film, it isn't a bad movie. The characters aren't too poorly constructed, though they could have been better. The plot seems to flow fairly well from point to point, which is primarily Edward trying to figure out what the heck is going on. Yes, quite a few liberties were taken with the original Shaffer script, but these liberties seemed to tie the story together a bit differently than the original version.As with any film, there were some rather silly moves that make one shake their head, but these are really not discussable without spoiling a little here and there. Suffice to say, it's not perfect, but few films are.So, in the end, I did not watch a movie that stunk. If this shared the slate with the likes of Manos, Date Movie, or Friday the 13th Part VIII, I would be the first to say so, but it wasn't that bad. If you have seen the original, prepare for a different film with a similar plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, the film features the actor Nicholas Cage rather more than the story. Generally speaking, Cage is a good actor, however, the story ought to be the principal draw with the actors fleshing out characters and making the screenplay believable. And, because the original was so effective the remake begins with the handicap of having to live-up to an original story and genuinely thoughtful horror story. The original has a quality of complexity not evident in this version. It also seems rather odd to develop a film with the same conclusion - but for some reason reversing the order of sexual procreative domination (from the original)while pretty much emasculating males beyond their value as a tool for impregnating the women. The saving grace was the beautiful British Columbia scenery.</fullReview>

I've recently watched the original British film and, while it is not a masterpiece, it was simple, original, to the point. This one was obscure, with a few elements that were added completely without a point, a lot of good stuff left out and some very boring screenplay.Long story short, a failure! I couldn't believe how this neo-puritanism that plagues America would turn a slightly erotic horror with a backbone into a boring thriller. The point of the original story was completely lost. Only the ending scene was slightly better.Don't watch it and if you haven't watched any of the films yet, watch the one from 1973. And if you are into hives, read Hellstrom's Hive, by Frank Herbert.

		<fullReview>A lot of people have been ragging on this film. I kind of see why. The original is a well liked film, and the remake in no way reaches its heights of bizarreness. Had there never been an original film then maybe this one wouldn't be so looked down upon. The story is sound as cop Edward Malus travels to Summerisle to search for a missing girl. This is the same basic gist of the original but the remake does toss in a few new touches here and there. Before there was a Lord Summerisle but now the island is a matriarchal society. The singing and dancing have been pretty much removed from the proceedings, so don't expect a nude Britt Eklund doing a fertility dance. Also new is the cop's connection to the proceedings. Its nice too that the downbeat ending was left in tact as well. While it falls short of the original, it could have turned out far worse. It could have been done as a comedy.</fullReview>

It was the worst waste of time spent watching a film in my life. I could have been sleeping and valued my time more! If you like "The Village" you might like this movie. The ending is nothing you would expect and leaves you with a feeling of emptiness instead of the normal feeling of satisfaction. Don't get your hopes up on this one. It is not a movie you would want to buy because you will not even want to watch it again. Nicholas Cage does very well in this movie as far as his acting goes but the movie itself is a let down. Spend your money more wisely and rent "Superman Returns", at least you will get a since of fulfillment when the credits roll. Whoever wrote this ridiculous script does not get out much and must thrive on those who want movies to end the way you expect. I do not recommend anyone who loves movies to watch this. It is not scary or thrilling, it is a twisted plot from the beginning and a horrible upset at the end. If people like the ones portrayed in this movie exist, they are sick individuals and should be condemned to a miserable life. Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicolas cages performances are OK but not the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicolas cage had done some good performances on the movie which made me watch the DVD till it ends but the story line of the movie is really bad and boring ... and Kate beahan is so sweet although she turns to be an evil womens daughter ...the movie had no horror as i know ... includes a bit of mystery drama and thriller ... its more kind of a detective story ... to tell the truth i fell asleep sometimes while watching it so that i pause the movie slept and watched again after a good half an hour sleep ... if it isn't for one of my favorite actors Nicolas cage and his best performances of all time i would have stopped the movie after the first half an hour forever ...anyway i recommend u not to watch it in a theater its not that worth ... but if its to kill some time you can use the movie DVD ... or else if your a Nicolas cage fan buy the DVD ...i give the movie 3 out of 10 but it would have been 1 or 2 out of 10 if it wasn't for n.c.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not that bad!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is nowhere near as bad as people are posting. There are several scenes that are pretty funny, that are not supposed to be. For example Nicolas Cage running around in the bushes in a bear suit! Also the constant slapping himself in the face from bee attacks. The movie's filming locations were great! They were filmed on the coast of British Columbia, Canada. The story had some suspense but was not scary. The story centers on Nicolas Cage's character trying to find a little girl on an isolated island. On this Island lives a religious cult made up of mostly women. He must find out if she has been murdered or if she is being held captive somewhere on the island. The story moves along quickly, and was mildly entertaining. I would not have paid money to watch it in the movie theater, but it is definitely worth renting. I would give it a strong 5 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie does not compare with the original. I could hardly believe how poorly it was written and directed. The actors did a poor job. This is not one of Nicholas Cage's better movies. He should have been embarrassed to be part of the movie, and he was one of the producers. There was very little creativity in the movie. There was very little to keep the movie going. I would only recommend watching this movie if it were on TV and you had nothing else to do. I could hardly stand to watch it to the end. Watch the original if you haven't seen it. Even if I had never seen the original I would not have enjoyed this movie, and the people who I watched it with agree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This "film" was terrible. It tries so hard to be scary but you'll end up laughing like there's no tomorrow. Not to mention the ridiculous lines. From such masterpieces as "Killing me won't bring back your goddamn honey!" to "Ahh my legs!" (or of it's Unrated, "Ahh, my eyes!"), or the scenes of Nic Cage running around karate kicking and punching women in a bear outfit, the one just doesn't let up, nevermind the ridiculous story and the fact that it makes zero sense. How the director would let the bad guys win no matter how horrible they are, I don't know, but you'll leave with nothing but a sense of "damn, that's 5 bucks i'm never getting back." Avoid like the bubonic plague.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen many movies that were far from good that I simply label as "entertaining" . This one forced me to create a new category. It's called -I want my 2 hours of life back- . My wife had this one pegged within the first 20 minutes and it was far worse that we thought. At the end we were just sitting there looking at each other while my eye developed a twitch. I'm glad that I didn't pay to see this. I would have been terribly upset. The acting was horrible. At some point you'll find yourself saying "I hope this all makes sense pretty soon". Do not watch this movie. I'm amazed that it scored as high as a 3 on the all mighty IMDb. I should have trusted the voters and not watched it. At least I had a good glass of wine while I suffered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pathetic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm about to spoil a good portion of this film. I feel it is necessary because occasionally harsh derision of a movie can actually coax a viewer into wanting to watch it even more. I would like to save you some time. This movie is a travesty- start to finish.For starters, the opening sequence is entirely unrelated to the rest of the movie. Perhaps it ties in a metaphorical way, but nevertheless, you will spend an hour and a half wondering what happened in the crash and what consequences it will have and the answer is NONE. It has no effect on Cage's character and it is entirely without closure throughout the rest of the movie. Ridiculous.The movie attempts to be clever by throwing a complete plot switch-up in at the end but it is very much unfounded and just cruel, not ironic. There is no buildup or basis to it, and it actually creates a lot of confusion and contradiction to previous parts of the film. It's just unnecessary, and the extraordinarily violent acts performed on Cage could easily have been quite cathartic if performed on ANY SINGLE OTHER CHARACTER IN THE FILM, but as it stands it's just mean and depressing.The film is nonsensical tripe. It is the arthritic skeleton of a snuff film draped in the rancid meat of a psychological thriller. Regardless of metaphors and allegory, it stands in the realm of continuity and logic as a shambling, flaming golem of crap. Without question, skip this horrible film. Please.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Uncessary remake of the cult film of the same name.It isn't that bad I've seen worse.What i couldn't get my head around was that they changed the story in some ways,such as the island in this version is dominated by women and men have little purpose there{or do they}. Nicolas Cage is called to the island under false pretences by a former girlfriend,who claims that her daughter has gone missing and she later tells him that he is the paternal father. He quickly travels to the island to help her and finds that the locals are not very interested in the girls whereabouts and they also practise some very strange customs. In the original version Edward Woodward{the policeman}is a virgin and that is why he was chosen for sacrifice,in this remake Nicolas Cage is obviously not a virgin as hes fathered a child,So why was this part of the story changed. And because these parts of the story were changed i was expecting an alternative ending and was disappointed that there wasn't one.In my opinion an alternative ending would have been the only thing that would have saved the film considering how many other things were changed.But for some reason at the end they decided to stay loyal to the original,only making it more horrific by breaking Nicolas Cages legs when hoisting him up into the not to inviting Wicker Man figure. The good points about this film is that the location is beautiful and the atmosphere is genuinely eerie,the acting isn't bad although i feel that Nicolas Cage is badly miscast here he just doesn't look comfortable in this role which is another reason this film doesn't seem to work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only redeeming factors were the costumes and scenic location. If I wanted a story to be resolved with needless death and violence, I would simply read the newspaper. I really don't see how the claim, "a 1973 remake" made anyone want to work on this project in the first place. Perhaps the words "classic novel written in 1973" would work, but this? What were talented artists thinking? The plot also smacked of misogyny, as if anyone in this lifetime could actually take away white male privilege in the U.S. Odd how the subject of the "poor emasculated man" comes up more often than one would expect in films and theatre when the reality is nearly always completely the opposite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original, although I have heard of it. Unfortunately watching this version means I will the original when i do watch it will be rid of most of its tension, without this version providing any of its own. The island characters were 2 dimensional, with no real explanation of the islanders belief (the fact that they didn't like to oppression of women did not explain why they felt the need to burn a wicker man). There was no explanation as to why the men of island don't speak. The storyline was good, but the film was made in such a way that it was entirely predictable unfortunately. When there were the odd few moments where I didn't guess what was going to happen, to be quite honest I didn't care. The section with Nicholas Cage running around in a bear suit made me laugh out loud, rather than recoil in terror. And the final scene with willow and Honey chatting up 2 men in a bar was a scene I should possibly have cared about, but really didn't. Nicholas cage was unbelievable as a police officer. Praise Should go to the child actresses who did manage to be spooky and weird, but this film should never have been remade</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot is pretty nonsensical and stupid; in spite of Nicholas Cage's presence "The Wicker" is misconceived and lacks the doze of madness that would make it believable. First you never really see where Neil La Bute is going; didn't see the 1973 UK cult classic - set on a Scottish island - but this one would certainly need something more than a great actor. I wouldn't say it is completely rubbish but the idea could have been better developed coz like this it's only about a thriller that unintentionally turns into a comedy, full of fails. There are many cute girls, like Molly Parker, Tania Saulnier and Lele Sobieski but it's not enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really curious about this movie when I read about it on the web. The plot line looked very interesting and the presence of Nicholas Cage leads me to think that would be a good movie.I'm just back from the theater and I'm really disappointed with this movie. The story is nice but the second half of the movie the main character looks more a scared middle age corporate worker than a cop. The end of the movie is just too plain and has no "wooo, nice" at all.This is one of that movies I regret to have spent my money to watch it.

		<shortDescription>Very Bad Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just terrible. I mean really horrible movie. The sad thing is that before I saw this movie I saw Nicholas Cage in an interview say that he has been waiting his whole career to remake this movie. He said the original was his all time favorite movie. That goes to show you that actors even the great ones might not have such great taste. Let me guess Nicholas your second favorite was Gigli? And your favorite actor of all time was Chris Farley for his dramatic stage presence? (No offense to Chris Farley's family)I think that this movie should have been left at the original. It was not a great movie but had a cult following. Movies like that should be left alone. That would be like Matt Damon and Ben Affleck deciding one day they want to remake Pulp Fiction. Leave it alone. Which is what this director neglected to do. This movie was a mixture of boredom and confusion for me. I could not wait until the end. Maybe I would have been better off not watching the first one. Then maybe that might have helped. On a scale of 1-10 I gave it a 2. Thats the best it deserves.</fullReview>

It was just getting more and more bad and stupid. The script was very poor, and the acting sucked big time. The only reason that i've voted 2 instead of 1, is because Nicholas Cage is the only one that actually know how to act, his performance wasn't that bad. Everyone else sucked! The plot was meant to be original "they" said, but oh my god it was not! I've seen this kind of movies a houndred times! It's not that far from "Population 436" witch by the way also sucked!

		<fullReview>This movie is a laugh riot! You'll be rolling in the aisles with all your buddies as Nicolas Cage attempts to ride a bicycle! Or when Leelee Sobieski tries to act! Or when the film totally jumps the railings in the final few scenes! I saw this movie with a few friends in an almost completely empty theatre and we were giggling from the first reel to the last. Full of misogyny, lines that are completely unintentional howlers, every horror movie cliché you can imagine, and a performance by Ellen Burstyn so awful that you'll wonder how she was ever nominated for an Oscar, let alone allowed to be in films. When the ending of your movie has your character punching out a giant fat woman, stealing her bear costume from her, and prancing along to save a little girl from a bunch of other people dressed up in animal costumes, you know you've got a stinker. Not only that, but it's from everyones favorite woman hater, Neil Labute. Hey, Neil, still scared of girls? That's too bad, maybe some day you will no longer fear the cooties. The original Wicker Man was an absolute laugh riot as well (the art school crowd will tell you it's really, really DEEP, but don't listen to them), but at least it sort of knew it was bad...I think. So, I guess I can recommend this film as an evening of laughs, but don't go in expecting anything scary.</fullReview>

I was eager to see the movie because of the cast (Ellen Burstyn for one) and because it was featured as a scary movie; I guess my expectations were too high.I consider this one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the 1973 version, but still an intriguing remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I would like to say I am a huge fan of the original, despite thinking this movie was going to be really bad, I went ahead and watched it anyway. I was pleasantly surprised by this remake. I read so many negative reviews and it has a really bad rating here, 3.4/10 is harsh.I'm a big Nicolas Cage fan and I think he did very well in playing the role of Edward Malus and had a lot of good moments, I was impressed by the quality of the performances all round. I thought LaBute's direction was good too and the movie had a good feeling of dread and tension that was created throughout the story, very much like the original.I feel in a way how The Wicker Man went wrong is that it wasn't daring enough to really be different to the original, (other than the island being controlled by women) some of the scenes were basically identical, I think it would have been interesting if LaBute made it that Cage found some way of escaping at the end, or at least made his death more violent, I was even more disappointed with this when I read an interview in Total Film with LaBute where he said:"Some torture scenes towards the end of the movie ended up just getting cut. There was a kind of purifying ritual they put Cage's character through before they take him to the wicker man. They broke his knees and they put a helmet of bee's on his head. (you see him with the helmet on in one of the trailers). He was stung, virtually to death, then brought back with an adrenaline shot - only to be hauled up by his legs in the wicker man. It was a pretty savage, wonderful section"Again, I don't understand why this wasn't included, that extra stuff sounded cool to me, would have made the scene much more violent and better, maybe even better than the original's!However, I enjoyed this movie overall and I still feel this was a quality remake of a horror classic, and perhaps harshly overlooked by many movie fans and critics.</fullReview>

All I know is that my friend Dave and I went into this movie hoping for a scare and came out of it giddy with laughter. Not a good sign for a horror movie but an enjoyable experience nonetheless.

You might as well have been filming a Girls Gone Wild and Psychotic DVD!The original British Lion movie was more accurate. This remake is too extreme. The original had the inhabitants of the island in unity, women and men together. The insult to feminism is that the island is totally run by women with the men walking around as "Tommys"... Deaf, Dumb, &amp; Blind, not "Pinball Prodigies". That should also be claimed as an insult to Dianic Wicca as Well! Feminism is NOT about hating men and Wicca is "And it Harm None, do what ye will". We still have bonfires but we don't sacrifice Animals and Humans in them anymore. In the original they followed the ritual correctly, even if it was disturbing. In the remake, it's nothing but total Bloodlust!I hope the filmmakers are aware of the law of Three-Fold. They sent out this horrible remake that distorts Paganism, they get back 3X losses. The next time you do a remake of a movie with a Pagan theme, stick with the facts that we don't hunt and sacrifice animals &amp; humans and shun out the opposite sex in our practice. Do your research and don't assume things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lame script, badly made into a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason I went to see this movie is Nicolas Cage. After his role in The Lord of War, I thought - even an horror movie would be OK if he plays there. I was dead wrong. During the entire movie, it's clear that the act of the main character cannot be understood and, well, looks just plain weird. At the end of the movie - you understand why. However, the turning point at the end movie is ridiculous. The poor direction takes place in the scene where they all shout: "The victim must die". I would just like to get my two hours back - the movie had no suspense, cheap horror tricks, doubtful acting and a lame ending. If it's for Nicolas Cage, you should go watch Wild At Heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was probably in the worst four I've seen in the last two or three years. Nicolas Cage should fire his agent. He is too good to do this sort of film. The overall acting is far below par. The story is not that intriguing. This movie is not remotely scary like the trailers might have you believing. This is one of those movies that makes you say, "Man, Hollywood sure puts out tons of movies today. But is quantity a plus when quality suffers like this film indicates?" I would not even recommend this movie for a DVD rental. Time could be better spent re-watching a good movie one has already seen. I hope I've sufficiently advised you because I wish I would have read other's sentiments before checking this movie out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Atrocious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wicker Man is a "horror/thriller" starring Nicolas Cage, who has just dropped a few notches in my book for making this movie. He plays a cop investigating the disappearance of a little girl who lives on an strange island. He gets there and finds there's a bigger mystery involving the weird natives of the island. This plot may sound okay on paper, but on screen it seems like the dumbest concept ever. The plot is filled with gaping holes bigger than the grand canyon, and the acting is so horrific, it is probably the scariest part of the movie. At first the movie doesn't seem that bad, but as the story progresses, it gets progressively worse. It gets to a point where you question if they're actually being serious. At about half way through the movie, I was chuckling a bit, but by the 'climax' of the movie, I was nearly on the floor of the theater, rolling around with uncontrollable laughter. Whether Cage was screaming at 10 year old girls that they're liars, or was running around in a bear suit and roundhouse kicking women, you will be laughing so hard at how bad, and intentionally funny the movie is. To be honest, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life. The tag line is "Some Sacrifices Must Be Made". Trust me, and don't 'sacrafice' your time, or money on this absolutely atrocious movie. 2/10... for making me laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand what the matter was with Nicolas Cage when he picked Neil LaBute to make this, because the result manages to fumble EVERY SINGLE ASPECT of what made the original film great.Amazingly, it seems to be a peculiar hybrid of Hollywoodised rubbish and LaBute's usual anti-female ranting. It starts out establishing that Cage's Edward Malus (a name no-one in the film pronounces properly) has "issues", and when he gets to the pointlessly retitled Summersisle (not, unfortunately, pronounced "summer sizzle"), the local act in such arch, melodramatic and generally suspicious manner as to make K9 &amp; Company look subtle.The dialogue is so bad that people were openly laughing at the screen, and there were what appeared to be some very poorly-judged attempts at humour which may have been unintentional. Changing the original's Pagan-but-modern society into a bizarre quasi-Amish matriarchy doesn't work, and merely shows up LaBute typical apparent hatred of women, as the all-female conspiracy to trap and kill the only independent man on the island is revealed. "Look out!", LaBute is shouting, "the women are all out to get you and sap your masculine power!" I find it incredible that the subtlety, intelligence and wit of the original could have been totally excised from the script and direction, but with a talentless cretin like Neil LaBute in charge, it should be no surprise that this is as insulting, ugly, obvious and misogynistic as it is.It is by far the worst film I have seen since Revolver, and that really stank.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-made but still flawed remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit I rather enjoyed this movie, although I knew walking out of the cinema a lot of people were going to tear it to pieces. This is indeed what has happened, and the movie has been predictably compared in an unfavourable light to the original.The updated story sees a trauma-stricken traffic cop (Nicholas Cage) summoned to a distant island, Summersisle, by a letter from his ex. She needs him to help her search for their missing daughter whom the rest of the islanders, devout pagan-worshippers, may be hiding in preparation for a ritual sacrifice...The problems are neither in the production or the performances but in the plot. Whilst the central character (Nicholas Cage's Edward Malus standing in for Edward Woodward's Sergeant Howie) has been updated in an interesting way, this was not handled to the best effect and any emotional impact it could have registered was completely lost. The second half of the movie played far too quickly. More patience and care with this, particularly the climax, could have significantly heightened the overall effect. Furthermore, the addition of a coda at the end to suggest the possibility for sequels was completely pointless.Given the religious zealotry which seems to occupy both Western and Middle East politics these days, I would have enjoyed seeing an updating of the religious conflict (Christianity versus Paganism) of the original, placing this conflict in a contemporary light. The gender-reversed society depicted in the remake, with dominant women subjugating the males, did not hold water. Plot threads from the prologue, with Malus the traffic cop failing to rescue a woman and child from burning in a car crash, were never really followed through, leaving their inclusion in the story questionable. The fate of the unfortunate pilot who takes Malus to the island leaves another gaping plot hole.All this said, the movie certainly looks good. The production is well-shot by director Neil LaBute and the surroundings of the islanders make for sunny, heavenly contrast to their sinister intentions. Some night time sequences with Malus searching for his daughter in the dark or underwater are also of note. I quite liked the new look of the briefly seen Wicker Man, with its human occupant snared inside its head this time.The performances, while not outstanding, are more or less satisfactory given the obstacles faced by the actors in the script. Nicholas Cage had my sympathies, until towards the end when he started to turn violent and manic. This move did not seem wholly logical or grow out of what had gone before. Ellen Burstyn does fine in the role of Sister Summersisle but sounds a bit embarrassed when she has to repeat lines spoken by Christopher Lee in the original. But her quiet-seeming passivity belies her enormous power, and this worked well in the performance.Although worth a look for its production values and efforts of the principal performers, I am afraid I would still recommend the 1973 original above this brave but misguided effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilariously bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this with a friend while I was home on summer vacation. I have never seen the original. My friend and I settle down with our popcorn and we're expecting a thriller, maybe a few scares, just something at least a little spooky. We ended up laughing out-loud a few times instead and I hardly ever laugh even at comedies. When the car with the girl in it was hit by a truck the first time, it wasn't scary, it was very final destination so it was kind of expected. Anyway, throughout the movie, he keeps hallucinating and seeing the truck come out of nowhere and hit the car or a little girl. The 2nd time, when the truck showed up out of nowhere on the ferry and t-boned a random 12 year old, my friend and I were in hysterics. Even if i completely ignored the truck thing, the rest of the movie was just....it wasn't anything! It wasn't scary, or funny or even dramatic. He's chasing around looking for this little girl and a lot of the acting seemed off. Another thing was nothing there was so much in the movie that had nothing to do with anything. It was random and probably put in cause "it looked perty on film". Seriously, don't waste your money. Oh, and the ending was terrible too. They kept explaining to Nicolas Cage's character over and over and over. It redundantly redundant if you see my point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary Movie Five</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film fully believed itself to be mysterious and disturbing, yet as it went on, I began to question whether or not it actually meant to be mocking its own actors and their scripts or was going on in total sincerity. Kate Beahan's rambling, unconnected lines were indisputably straight from one of the popular Scary Movie comedies, which are MTV type mockeries of modern-day thrillers. A few chuckles in the beginning lead you to think the movie is about to get somewhere, but just when it starts to get going is when it starts getting bad. As soon as he arrives on the island it plummets to the level of a grade school film project. The efforts it makes in being haunting and mysterious are painfully embarrassing. Half way through I began looking around at others in the theater wondering if they were as disturbed as I was by the fact that such respected actors as Nicolas Cage and Ellen Burstyn agreed to do this film after reading the script. The cinematography was clunky, the timing and rhythm was completely off, the music score and lack of was confusing when matched with the scenes, and the casting was just bad. If there was any good acting in it, I didn't notice, being distracted by the laughable lines and strange concoction of the island and its inhabitants. Odd moments kept popping up here and there, such as a random and unexplained kiss between Nicolas Cage's character and Kate Beahan's - just to name one of many. Plus, we could have been given the story with just the beginning and end, as the middle part of the movie did nothing to push it along. It gave no revealing hints to entice us or keep us guessing. However, it wasn't that necessary to have hints with such a predictable ending. This movie goes in the hall of fame of unintentionally hysterical films. So, bravo, filmmakers, I'll never forget this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicholas Cage looked seriously ill in this movie, which no doubt he will never want to see. The inconsistencies and implausibilities became so numerous that the movie soon evolved into a sick version of a Shakespearean comedy. The reversal of Lord Summersisle from the original to Lady Summersisle appears to be a result of political correctness rather than to enhance the story. However, I predict that this will eventually become a cult classic in the same vein as Ed Wood's famous flick and Rocky Horror with all of the same regalia to follow. I recommend you pick up the 1973 version on DVD for a much better rendition of this tale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Believe me, you'll be VERY GLAD you read this, even though it's a spoiler.As I was watching this movie, I thought it was kind of neat. The guy's (Nicholas Cage) daughter was missing on some weird island (the island's inhabitants are what made it weird), and he was searching for her. The movie was pretty good until the end when I found out the truth. It turns out the entire "your daughter is missing" thing was just a scheme to get him to come onto the island so that those outrageous pagans could sacrifice him! They sacrificed him at the very end, and then two girls went out to find to more guys to sacrifice for later. There is no other movie in existence that stinks as much as this one does. I would actually pay someone to destroy every copy of this movie in existence.Some things the movie tried to tell me (that I, of course, don't agree with): 1) Women are evil. 2) Having sex with women can have dire consequences (i.e. being sacrificed). 3) Never go to strange islands to find your daughter. You may find her, but you'll never come out alive.You get the idea. This movie was horrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this film I couldn't help think that it wasn't so much a remake but rather a remix of the earlier classic crossed with a made for TV film called Harvest Home which was written by ( I think) Thomas Trydon and which came out either in the 1970s or 1980s. Certainly, it seemed to borrow more heavily from that book/film than from the original version of the Wicker Man, which dealt more I think with the pagan aspect than this film did. I really couldn't see why Neil La Bute, Nicholas Cage or Ellen Burstyn would want to be bothered with such a weak and unnecessary exercise. In my view it failed to add anything to the original, which I still think is one of the best chillers of all time. I would be interested to hear whether other people agree with the Harvest Home connection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. It's the day after seeing this movie and I am still feeling a bit icky. This movie was pretty disappointing. The story had so many holes and unanswered questions that it makes me want to say, "Don't waste your money." First, what was the deal with the car wreck at the beginning? Was it staged only to give Nicolas Cage's character enough time off to be able to go to Summersisle? If so, that is a very disappointing thing. Secondly, Nicolas Cage, being a police officer, is very unrealistic. He doesn't press for important answers that the audience wants to know. For example, "Why don't the men talk?" "What DO you women do when a baby boy is born?" "Why do you let the children torture animals?" "What is the deal with the sex ed so early?" etc. *sigh* Then there were the scenes that were obviously just thrown in to make the movie longer. For example, the whole thing at the beginning with the self-help tapes. What the heck was that about? And what about the little thing about Nicolas Cage's character being allergic to bees? That leads to another question: "What exactly is the OLD WAY in which she cured him?" Overall, we walked out of this movie going, "I wasted two hours of what little time I have on earth for that?"</fullReview>

OMG cuz we couldn't see that coming.. so they tell him the Kid and the ex planned it all and they're sister Summersisle's family... soo omg they break his legs and then SUSPEND him from them up into this wicker statue... (see THAT'S where the name of the movie came from... my GOD!!) and then he yells to his kid who most likely has no idea who he is "hunny, don't light the statue on fire... please!!!" and she does... and he burns... then.... SIX MONTHS LATER!!!! his ex and another woman from the island are at a bar and they seduce two other men...

The original film was maligned by its own studio and eventually developed its cult audience years later when a campaign began to re-release its original director's cut after the British studio, British Lion, relinquished a cut-and-paste hack job that was to be released originally stateside by maverick film producing legend Roger Corman (who owned a print luckily since the studio destroyed its original supposedly as land fill for a British highway!)I must admit I hadn't seen the original until just recently after speaking with a lovely young British babe at a friend's birthday dinner who had informed me she was a huge horror film fan and we were discussing our favorites when I mentioned the forthcoming re-make of this film! She suggested I see the original first ? and after a lengthy search found a copy (the Americanized cut too) to rent and was surprised at how good it actually was. So when I went to see this new version I admit I was expecting something of it ? something to hope would do justice to its original.Needless to say it did what I would've normally expected had I not seen the original: tank.The film takes place now in Puget Sound in Washington, where California cop Edward Malus (Cage) is beckoned by his ex-fiancée Willow Woodward (Beahan late of "FlightPlan"), who is living in a commune known for its honey exporting, to help her find her recently missing young daughter. Malus is also recovering from a horrible auto accident that has psychically scarred him so he figures to head to the woodsy isle ? Summer's Isle to be exact ? to get away from his demons and to possibly find out why Willow left him after all these years.When Malus arrives after negotiating a pick-up ride with the sea-plane pilot who brings the denizens their daily supplies, he discovers that the locales aren't exactly the welcome committee and have nothing but disdain for this man regardless of his being of the law (he's told his law doesn't matter there which fuels his anger/need to find out what became of Rowan, the little girl, even more). When he reunites with Willow she is skittish and full of paranoia suggesting something horrible has happened to Rowan. Malus continues to investigate and winds up deeper and deeper into this odd island's customs which seem to be a pagan cult eschewing any Christianity or morality much to Malus' increasing chagrin. What follows is a daisy-chain of unexplained red herrings and a wild goose chase to his fateful summation. To say more would ruin the original film's shocking close but here it is something of a relief for its trodding and ill-kept pacing.What is largely absent is the religious overtones that caused the struggle of the main character in the original piece whereby the post-feminism and misogyny LaBute ("In The Company Of Men") is best known for and makes a few significant changes including the aforementioned piety as well as a matriarch (Burstyn as Sister Summerisle) and a predominately female hierarchy that is only touched upon its most basic of principles. While Cage makes the most of his character it would have been real interesting to have someone like Edward Norton or Johnny Depp adding their own shadings to a possibly interesting protagonist, but to have Malus resorting to an old chestnut (spoiler: the girl is actually his daughter too) to have motivation only takes away from the mystery at hand. Is God really dead?LaBute is better known for his dense dialogue than camera-work and although a few nice moments of Cage getting his ya-yas out it doesn't quite gel and feels half-hearted in the long run. Supposedly both LaBute and Cage (whose production company Saturn Films is responsible for the remake) love the original and it's surprising how in such capable hands a remake was ill-advised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest movie ever (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, at the start of the movie i was getting into the movie; but when he started yelling at kids and calling them all "little liars" i started to laugh. I thought it was just a one time funny thing; how wrong was I. After that part the movie just turned into a mistaken comedy, and keep in mind this was only like 25 min into an 110min movie. Pretty much Cage goes on a god dam rampage, pointing guns at unarmed women, jacking some womens bike, riding the bike looking like Mr.bean. And the top it all off near the end of the movie when he realizes his kid is still alive and is gonna be sacrificed he walks down stairs into the tavern and really and i mean really clocks this women named sister BEECH. Honestly sound that out, just say it out loud, what does that does like so you, son of a beech. The whole movie you hear this name and you can't help but laugh abit. Anyways after he punches sister Beech in the face and TKOs her, another girl comes in and jumps on his back, he then flips her over and punches and kicks her right into a wall. It's funny cause they look like milk maids. Then takes sister beeches bear suit to get his kid back at this sacrificial festival (they are going to burn her alive because they believe she cursed their crops)all these people have stupid ass costumes too, really funny to see. Cages kid is tied up to a pole and everybody is standing far back, and all you see is this guy running in a bear suit towards this kid. Then after that he finds up he has bin set up and he turns out to be the one that they want to sacrifice. So as they capture him he says" Killing me won't bring back your god dam honey" and then (Snap)"MY LEGS" really funny you have to watch it. Basically if you want to go see a thriller don't see this movie nobody can take it seriously, but if you wanna see comedy well then my friend you can to see this movie cause nothing fits right with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to agree with most people. Somehow the remake lost what made the original fantastic. Cage did not live up to Woodwards character. The back-story interrupted what could have been a sure Oscar front-runner. However, The female characters by far surpassed Cages performance. The female leads actually made up for his lack of substance. Ellen Burstyn was remarkable. Ellen breathed life into the pagan aspect of the film. Bravos should go to Ellen. Surely she will deserve a nod. I did enjoy the retention of the "wicker" icon. Also noteworthy was the timeliness with the Burning Man festival, held the same as the opening weekend. It would be wonderful to see what was edited out. Perhaps that might explain the gaps in the new version that fell to the cutting room floor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie looks alright I guess but in my opinion this Wicker man movie does not live up to the hype that the predecessor did back in the day. I have to say I was really surprised that Mr. Cage chose this part to be in this movie because it doesn't suit his trend of movies. Personally I think the only real undead movie he did was that whole ambulance driver dead persons movie that was not bad. He has always been the crazy bad guy and many other roles, but undead talking ghost whisperer kind of guy I have to say no. This movie is probably as hyped as the VMA's was this week. Still if you are into this type of a flick go ahead and see it. Personally I'd rather see Starship Troopers again then this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As previously mentioned this film is no 'tunnel' film, that is the audience can easily spot the ending after the penultimate minutes, this of course was a re-make, perhaps the saddest thing about the whole film. It was in fact a pretty mediocre film in 1974 and it is more so in 2006. The original, a British production and starring Edward Woodward as the local 'bobby' on a small Island of the coast of Cornwall (South-West England, UK).So essentially this Americianized version really doesn't go any further than the original, a sad fact that is the only haunting element of this film.However, if you still want to see this film in you 'Doubting Thomas' fashion, Nicolas Cage would be the only reason that you will stay beyond the initial moments of this still mediocre film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I'd like to point out that i haven't seen the original so the whole film was new to me. I'm seriously glad that i hadn't seen the original as it would have spoiled an enjoyable film with comparisons and obviously nothing would shock me. It starts off well with swift pace and introduction but veers off course slightly time passes. Howevever good ol' Nic Cage managed to keep my attention focused on the screen and not my nuts (peanuts.. not the other... never mind). He puts in a performance that is significantly better than the rest of the cast whom i thought were rather bland, or maybe that was the point.So, things to consider when watching The Wicker Man:1) Don't make comparisons to the original or rate the new against the old.2)Stick with it during the dull moments and savour the moments of tension.Overall an average movie thats definitely worth a watch because of Cage. It'll pass the time but not a memorable film. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicholas Cage delivers a one-note performance in a predictable and uncompelling thriller. Cage is invited by a former fiancé to an isolated feminist commune where he investigates the disappearance of her daughter. There he discovers a female-led cult with mysterious rituals and practices. The cult's misandrist attitudes reflect director Neil LeBute's continuing fascination with the subject of gender wars; however, unlike such previous efforts as "In the Company of Men" which looks at its male characters' misogyny in lurid detail, "The Wicker Man" uses the cult's hatred of men as a superficial plot device. This leaves only the mystery of the little girl's disappearance, the answer to which many viewers -- even those who haven't seen the original -- will see coming from a mile away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe this is one of the worst films I have ever seen in my entire life. The ending is unsatisfactory, the plot is full of holes and we are lead to a path where there is nothing to know about. The car scene in the beginning has nothing to do with the entire film, except to draw a back story to the character, but it keeps itself repeating on and on with different flavors that end up meaning nothing. The middle of the story doesn't sag, it is a fact. It could have been a great one if it really concentrated on a different path. I see a film with many GOD EX-MA CHINA and convenient holes. A pure waist of time. No wonder why it has a poor 36 evaluation. Run away from it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Negative reviewers make Neil LaBute's 2006 remake of "The Wicker Man" out to be an incredulous turkey on the level of "Plan 9 from Outer Space" and "American Beauty," but it's simply not the case.First of all, let's be honest about the original 1973 version: Yes, it's a unique and original film in multiple ways and has numerous strengths, including fine Scottish locations and the presence of Britt Ekland and Ingrid Pitt (the former's siren-like "How Do" song &amp; dance is a definite highlight), but it's not the masterpiece that many claim. What's wrong with it? For one thing, the protagonist, Sgt. Howie (Edward Woodward), is annoying and unlikable; he comes off as a Pharasaical tighty-righty (which is how he struck me and I'm a Christian!). This is a serious flaw when you consider that the entire film focuses on Woodward's progressive search for the missing girl. In addition, Christopher Lee is just 'there' as Lord Summerisle (which is blasphemy to Lee fans since Lee considered his part in "Wicker Man" his personal best). The biggest problem with the original is that the film plays out in a dull manner; the plot itself is interesting, but the delivery isn't.Woodward is so unlikable and annoying that, on some subconscious level, I was almost glad with his outcome at the end. Which brings up another criticism of the original film: I didn't find the ending horrifying. It was supposed to be, but somehow it wasn't.One last criticism of the 1973 original is that it's understandably dated. It's obvious a product of the free-love hippie era and it shows. If any film screamed out for a remake this was it. THE PLOT: The story in this new version switches to America. Nicholas Cage plays a California cop searching for his ex-fiancé's daughter on a mysterious privately owned island in Washington's Puget Sound. The society is backwards, pagan and matriarchal; the men are mute and second class. As the film progresses, Cage comes to see that the inhabitants are lying to him about the girl's disappearance.WHAT WORKS: Unlike Woodward, Cage is likable as the protagonist (or, at least, we can relate to him). His mounting frustration and anger over the situation are understandable. When he ultimately turns to outright violence against the women we understand what has driven him to such actions.The British Columbian locations are good, pretty much on a par with the Scottish locations of the original in their own unique way.Ellen Burstyn is better than Christopher Lee as the villain. We don't even meet her until an hour into the film and she comes off as a creepy religious psycho (just because she's pagan doesn't mean she's not religious). Lee was bland in the original.Molly Parker as the school teacher and Leelee Sobieski are fetching (with Kate Beahan a distant third). Molly and Leelee are fully clothed at all times and yet somehow ooze beauty. Molly, in particular, has a very unique allure. One reviewer complained that there weren't any scenes of naked women as was frequently the case in the original, but the director didn't feel the need to go the softcore porn route. Lebute shows that true beauty is far more than numerous displays of softcore eroticism and overt nudity. If you want that rent a porn video.The story is generally entertaining, sometimes fun and, at times, unintentionally amusing. For instance, the scene where Cage talks with the "barmaid" and the patrons has some laugh-out-loud aspects. There are other humorous moments (Cage apprehending the bicycle: "STEP AWAY FROM THE BIKE!", running around in a bear costume, the dead girl suddenly appearing in his arms on the dock, numerous hilarious lines like "OH NO, NOT THE BEES, NOT THE BEES!!", etc.). Despite this, the picture somehow maintains a serious aura. The original, by contrast, was dead-pan serious and never entertained in this manner.The ending is horrifying (more so than the original), even though I knew it was coming. If you're in the right mood it can also be funny. The alternate ending is even better with the inclusion of overt torture scenes (although I know why they cut one of the torture scenes, the bees would've killed Cage since he was allergic to them). The Wicker Man prop is intimidating and over twice the size of the original.In the theatrical version there's a "6 months later" coda tacked on, which is an important scene. It shows how pre-meditated the actions of the women are in the film. It also explains one of Leelee's mysterious lines earlier in the story, "When you leave, take me with you." This sequence shouldn't have been cut from the alternate ending.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The search-in-the-barn sequence is pretty useless, but adds to the mounting mystery. Also, the story really bogs down in the graveyard scene where Cage and Kate have a heart-to-heart talk.Some people may look down on the film because of the unintentionally funny scenes noted above. I think it makes it more entertaining. If you don't agree with me STEP AWAY FROM THIS REVIEW!FINAL ANALYSIS: Both the 1973 and 2006 versions of "The Wicker Man" are equally valuable for their positive aspects noted above. The insane criticisms of the remake are unwarranted (remakes are, of course, a lose-lose situation: if the film in question is remade frame for frame like "Psycho" people complain, and if the filmmakers deviate from the original they'll complain even more; you can't win). The fact is that the 1973 version is severely dated and NEEDED to be remade, and this is a quality updating. It's worth catching if you like mounting mystery stories with creepy elements. On top of this, there are amusing elements. And, thankfully, the protagonist isn't some irritating legalist with a corncob stuck up his arse.The film runs 102 minutes.GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is plain bad. I only saw it because of the original, just to see what they would do with the idea. I had heard that it wasn't that good, but I honestly didn't expect it to be this catastrophically bad. The motivations of people are non existent. They're just there, and they just do what they do - primarily to scare and be creepy. Much of the (over)acting is laughable. Cage hams it up in some scenes. He has made some good movies, but in this movie, he just plain sucks. At least it sucks consistently, from start to finish!The movie lacks subtlety, is very clichéd and is grossly overdone. It becomes completely bizarre towards the end. Some of it seems like an unintentional(?) parody of horror movies, similar to Scary movie (I'm not kidding). &gt;&gt;slight spoiler&lt;&lt;The tagged on story, about the girl Cage's character couldn't save, does NOT ad depth or back story, it's just utterly pointless. It's just a "vehicle" for some boo scares/dreams later, and it becomes annoying.(Update: There's some theory going around that those people were part of the plot to get him there, and that they didn't die in the explosion - honestly that doesn't make any sense at all, unless they're supernatural beings.)Maybe the director hated the original, and wanted to spoof it? Why would anyone want to finance this crap? It just baffles me.Don't see this, unless you want to see an unintentionally (I think) funny movie. It was more sad to me, sad that I spend all that time watching the whole movie. What a waste of time.I repeat: This movie is REALLY, REALLY bad. You have been warned! See the original instead!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I start this review, I would like to say that I have not seen the original Wicker Man.This is unexpectedly hilarious even for a film starring Nicholas Cage playing a detective going to an island populated entirely by woman who use men as slaves trying to solve the disappearance of a little girl that's suppose to be his step-daughter. I was confused and bored multiple times throughout the film.But the ending really annoyed me. They sacrificed Nicholas Cage in a giant wicker man statue (that they somehow built without Cage's character knowing about it) and set it on fire. That makes no sense, seeing how he was detective in the police force and the islanders didn't think that anyone from the police force might investigate Cage's disappearance.But there were some hilarious moments, like when Cage dressed up like a bear and punches a woman, and of course, the bees scene.But all in all, this film is not worth your time and money. I'm sure the original had better pacing and the ending had a better payoff, but I am not interested in anything with a Wicker Man at the moment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wicker Man is the best British horror film of all time, so why did they remake it? What could be gained? Those are just some of the many questions one will ask after watching this unintentional comedy, and they are all virtually unanswerable. The existence of this film is offensive. However, this is not just any horror remake. This is the worst horror remake of all time. There is not one redeeming quality, not one bright spot, not one silver lining. Nicolas Cage, as many have forgotten, is a good actor and apparently Neil LaBute was considered a good director before this misfire. The biggest question of all is how did these 2 talented people and all of the other unfortunate people working on this (Who would probably gladly pay to erase their name from the credits) not realize that this mixture of screaming, bees, bear suits, bicycles, idiots, martial arts, ugliness, plot holes and scares which consist of... nothing is less scary than your average episode of Barney The Dinosaur? Nicolas Cage gives the worst performance by a good actor ever and spends the entire film either being wooden or screaming louder than Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween, while the other actors are blocks of wood with no personality. The script is toilet paper, with numerous plot holes and a total lack of what made the original so powerful. Neil LaBute may have done some noteworthy things before this, but judging from the direction here this could easily be mistaken for some laughably bad home horror movie made by 10 year olds. Still, at least 10 year olds could make a better horror film than this! This is a movie with no positives at all, and is an offensively pointless, jaw droppingly dreadful movie which has no right to exist expect as a guide for how not to do a horror movie, a Nicolas Cage screaming compilation or an advert for bee keeping and bear suits. There is nothing scary about this film except for the terrifyingly low quality. As for the unintentional comedy... I don't see what's funny about a great film being destroyed. The worst horror film of all time. Objective, not subjective.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superfluous remake but not that bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched the original a few times and think although it is good it is an overrated film. Although I was aware this remake had been slated (par for the course for any remake) I watched it with an open mind. Although it has a good cast I felt the performance of Cage was a little muted and not on a par with Edward Woodward's. Although the setting is different the plot is very similar. The air of menace so prevalent in the original is mainly lacking here though this could be in part because I knew what was coming. The ending is left the same but it really is not as affecting second time round.As it is, although it is nowhere near as bad as the rating suggests, this is no more than an average remake. It may be worth watching if your not familiar with the first one but if you are it's unlikely you'll find much to satisfy you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, there is no category lower than 1, or I would have given it. This "remake" bears absolutely no resemblance to the original 1973 version. The original was a thriller with pagan overtones, clearly written by people who had done their homework. They did not seek to present a genuine modern pagan viewpoint, but they worked hard to capture the essential flavor, even including a bit of dry humor, right at the beginning. The credits that read, "We would like to thank the people of Summerisle for a look into their religious practices," that sort of thing.This sorry bit of bilge does nothing of the sort. It is simply an exercise in anti-male misogynism. Phony feminism carried to its ultimate level of ridiculousness. Not a single male "resident" ever utters a line, which no doubt saved the producers a fortune but did nothing to establish this film's credibility, which it sorely needed. As a movie which has nothing to do with The Wicker Man, it's a loser, in its own right. The original is a brilliant classic; this one's a lame poser, that has none of the original's insight or TLC. Puke-O-Rama, kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the absolute mess that was the remake of The Wicker Man, I can only imagine that some sort of human sacrifice was made to appease the horror gods, thus preventing the genre from drying up altogether. Obviously, Nic Cage and Neil LaBute were too well known to go missing, so I have to presume that it was some minor studio exec or unknown extra that went up in flames to atone for this complete abomination.The original film was a masterpiece of suspense, brooding atmosphere, and absolute horror; viewers of director Neil LaBute's version are most likely to experience mounting rage or a fit of uncontrollable laughter, but never a sense of dread or unease. The performances are uniformly awful, the dialogue atrocious (and eminently quote-worthy as a result) and LaBute's sacrilegious screenplay alters far too many key plot elements: the action is moved from Scotland, where the story makes sense, to a small island community in the Puget Sound; the lead character is now an L.A. motorcycle cop; Lord Summerisle becomes Sister Summerisle; and Rowan, the missing girl, is the protagonist's daughter. Worst of all, LeeLee Sobieski doesn't even do a naked dance, which I would have reckoned was a no-brainer.Part of me is tempted to give The Wicker Man a high rating, just because I found it so bloody funny, but I fear that if I did, I could be next in line as a sacrifice from those who didn't find it such a laughing matter. Just to be safe, I give this one a rating of 3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When some people talk about The Wicker Man they only think in negatives, in a trite form of superficiality. What they fail to see is the soul of the film, and for this particular film, its soul speaks volumes. When I first saw this film I walked in simply to be entertained, and this film accomplished that job ten fold. Not only is this film suspenseful and scary when it needs to be, but ironically hilarious which adds a deeper layer even to such an interesting and unique film. If you ask if I thought this movie was excellent, I'll stand up for as long as time allows and proudly proclaim yes. I advise all who read this to watch the trailer on YouTube and decide for themselves, and as an added treat check out the trailer to Cage's next blockbuster "Trespass" http://on.fb.me/pchomT .

Scene, but that's just the tip of the iceberg! Where else are you gonna find a scene where Nicholas Cage points a gun at a woman on a bicycle and tells her "STEP AWAY FROM THE BIKE!", then in another scene comes downstairs and just on the spur of the moment, punches a woman knocking her out cold. Then Nicholas Cage dons a bear suit and punches another woman... I can't believe I just said that. I only give this movie a 2 out of ten because this movie needed more of these silly scenes, then at least it would have attained to a "so-bad-it's-good" status. As it is though, The Wicker Man even with it's scenes of ridiculousness is only good for one, maybe two viewings then you'll never want to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I completely do not understand why this movie is universally panned by literally everyone and every website. I liked this movie! I just seen this randomly with some friends, I thought it was going to be scarier, but I ended up loving the weird and creepy tones, it reminded me of that used-to-be show on Disney Channel where that girl would go around to different towns and inspect weird supernatural things, that show that was way too creepy for modern Disney standards. And this movie has the exact same feel, although it's definitely more adult. It keeps you on edge, and it also freaks you out a bit.I mean, good things about it: Nicholas Cage, good imagery, stuff that's to weird to get, weird twists and turns, and a decent ending. I honestly can't find a 'bad' thing about it, other than the fact it's not my favorite movie. Everyone's saying the acting was lame, I loved the characters! I think the acting was perfect for what the film was trying to portray. It's a weird movie, geez. It's not supposed to be Batman. One of the best movies Cage has been in, and I think this is the type of film he likes to be in. I'd say see it! And it's not like this is the first weird movie I've seen, I'm a huge fan of the weird, horror, supernatural, and whatever else, and I've seen way worse. The Unborn comes to mind there. And I'd watch Wicker Man even a second time! I say it's pretty good!(With all this in mind though, I have not seen the original.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish I could give it 0, but I gave it a 1 to be generous because Nic Cage tried, he really tried, to do his best to keep a straight face throughout this whole thing as he ran all over that country farmland. If ya gonna re-make something, then you're supposed to at least make it as good, if not, then better than the original. He failed on both counts. What was he thinking, and what were the producers thinking when they green-lit this stupidity? I don't think Labute himself understood what he was making. At least what he should've done, if he wanted to give it a slightly more glitzy, modern-day look to the film, was to remake the film shot-for- shot as Gus Van Sant did for Psycho. That might have worked, albeit with American accents, of course, and new music. Every scene in this film that was supposed to be somewhat shocking and surprising and scary were executed poorly. Labute seemed to not quite understand where to put the camera, how to cut the jumpy bits, and it just felt as though every scene seemed like a real trifle to direct, as if he was at conflict with the script that he wrote himself! Perhaps Labute was lost for words as to how to describe what he saw when he wrote the new version and that was what made it to the screen, the whole mise-en-scene and photography completely dull and flat, with no real mysterious feeling in any of it. The music also did not help, and that is because the composer must have found it difficult to accompany anything with any sort of crescendo when the shots and scenes sort of go from one to the next in a meander without specific moments of tension that should've heightened everything. It's amazing that these things get made at all, what a waste of time and money for everybody involved (except for the crew and actors who got paid to work on it).</fullReview>

I don't understand why this movie was even made! Couldn't they figure out a better way to waste money? How about a better way to spend money like on research (faustmanlab.org) or charity (purple hearts) or relief efforts (Katrina and Indonesia). But someone somewhere decided that this movie just had to be made and the works were set in motion to waste a boatload of money on something that would have left the world better off, quite frankly, had it not been finished. This movie is so bad that I was actually wondering if I was missing my cue to laugh as my mind had thoughts that this might in fact be a comedy. Alas, the laughs are unintentional and it is just dreck.Going through the motions is not acting, memorizing lines is not acting, putting words on a page does not a good script make, yelling "cut" or "action" is not all there is to directing. This was dreck from every conceivable angle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really want to rate this movie higher than a one because it was so awful it was almost entertaining...........almost!!!!!. The story is complete and utter garbage, this was supposed to be classed as a Horror/Thriller/Mystery and the only thing that makes you wonder is how the cast i.e. Nicolas Cage still manages to get work as an actor and not a stand up comedian. The movie starts bad somehow manages to get even worse, then it redems it self a little with Nicholas Cage dressing as a bear and punching women (sounds good right? well it bloody well is). Just when you think the acting could not get any worse it takes on a whole new level of bad (this would definitely get my vote as worst acting of all time, the scene near the end with the bee cage on his head). Thank you Hollywood you have now stolen another two hours of my life.</fullReview>

The message of the original movie was that his Christian religion was no more effective than the villagers beliefs. Did no one else pick up on this? There are no difference between religions, they are all just another way to control you by fear and threat. Blasphemy! I know. Think about it. Imagine no religion. All of the deaths, the sacrifices (read the old testament!) Nothing the villagers did was worse than the history of Christianity. There were so many parallels in the pagan rituals and the Christian ones. Festivals (Christmas, Easter), the wicker statue (altar,church).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never saw or even heard of the original, so I'll handle this on its own merits. Unfortunately, it has no merits! I don't ever say this kind of thing, but this may be the worst movie I have ever seen. I rented it because Nick Cage was in it. I'll know better in the future.The opening scene with a roadside car wreck implies promise, and yet this event is not really connected to the rest of the movie. It goes downhill from there.Cage plays a highway cop who was injured and traumatized in the roadside accident. He gets a letter from an old girlfriend frantic to find her missing daughter. Naturally, Cage goes to the private island she lives on to help out. The island is run by Ellen Burstyn, who heads a female cult of people who wear bird masks and act like the children of the corn.Cage is in really poor form in this picture. Shuffling about clumsily and constantly jumping into water (and emerging dry). It is not meant to be funny, but when you have a procession led by Burstyn with her face painted like a football fan, scores of women in bird masks following her, and Cage disguised in a bear suit, well, you just have to wonder what these people were thinking, and its funny! I was astonished that the players could all keep a straight face (maybe they just did LOTS of takes).And then it ends, with nothing resolved or accomplished. So, aside from its poor script, bad plot, lousy acting, overcast cinematography, lack of suspense, poor score, painfully slow pacing, and overall unintended hilarity, it is a fine film, deserving a -10 stars, if that were possible. What a turkey! Nick, what happened?</fullReview>

I personally know one of the musicians who contributed (and can be seen in the film) to the original. This is not the worst film ever - that would be an accolade. This is just pointless.The original Summerisle was an island of men and women who worked together and loved together and that was essential to the plot because they were pagans NOT feminists. I realise that a scene of men and women copulating freely in the open air would probably offend the prudish WASP community and ultimately affect the certificate of rating. But the way society was working on this new Summersisle was more like Planet of the Apes. It isn't even as if the original had special effects that could be improved upon. Why bother?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual Story ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was fairly different than the run-of-the-mill films you normally see. Although it lagged a bit in suspense, I appreciated seeing something fresh. Its beginning, middle and end aren't what you typically get in most modern movies.In very general terms, this movie is about a police officer (Cage) who investigates a missing child report. The interesting thing is that this all takes place in a society of women that is cut-off from the rest of society.While this scenario seems unlikely in real life, the filmmakers do a pretty good job of getting you to believe it during the movie. The society that the lead character enters is so different that it in itself gets you interested in the movie.Although the movie doesn't elicit the suspense the filmmakers probably desired, it does manage to create a sense of desperation for the lead character. He is cutoff from the world and it is easy to feel his frustration and limited options.If you're a Cage fan, this is not his best performance. It's hard to tell if it is due to him or the way the character is written; either way the lead character is a bit weak.This is worth seeing if you're in the mood for something very different. If you're looking for a really good "standard" thriller, action or suspense movie, this may not be the best choice.</fullReview>

After about 10 minutes, it was apparent that this movies really sucked, but, like Stone Cold, you just find yourself compelled to keep watching. To give credit where due, at least Ellen Burstyn has maintained her looks. Aside from that, this movie was just dreadful.Actually, this picture reminded me of another really bad film. I don't really remember the film's name, but the plot was basically these two guys rescue this girl who's getting beaten. The "bad" guy warns him "you'll regret this." So, she goes home with the "good" guy, and becomes the ultimate girlfriend: great looking, great cook, great bedmate. Of course, she's really a satanist, betrays the guy, and he ends up being sacrificed. Like I said--pretty bad.Wicker Man is even worse. Maybe not the absolute worst P.O.S. flick ever, but close. Top 10, for certain. And I'm not including those low-budget films made by Ed Wood in the 50's. Those are so bad, they're entertaining. This one isn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly horrible movie experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's unfortunate that you can't go any lower than one star. Prior to watching The Wicker Man, I had considered Aliens 3 to be the only movie that would actually merit negative stars. In all fairness, The Wicker Man doesn't detract from the enjoyment of an earlier film, but the fact remains that my cumulative movie enjoyment has been reduced by seeing it.There is a cheap trick all too often used in Hollywood when the producers are too stingy to hire good writers or in too much of a hurry to allow them to bring a plot to a satisfactory conclusion: slap in a shocker ending and hope that the public will mistake it for something artistic or meaningful. It is a gambit that rarely succeeds and in this case manages only to splatter embarrassment on a fine actor and ridicule upon the producers. Even more so in that the "carefully crafted" (or however they put it) conclusion didn't seem to follow logically from the plot (which naturally I can't elaborate on without introducing spoilers), and instead negates what merit the plot had up to that point.It is a film that might logically appeal to psychopaths, pedophiles, and possibly die-hard Nicholas Cage fans, but only to a few of the mainstream audience. If you really want something along these lines, I heartily recommend M. Night Shyamalan's The Village instead. Lacking some kind of memory-erasing pill, I suppose I need to watch something better to force it from my mind, say, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes or Pee-wee's Big Adventure?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I have not seen the original version, I do not see why there are so many negative comments about this film. True, the story is thin, but it is irresistible. I think people try to read more into it than what is actually there, and therefor miss the delightfully subtle plot altogether. Yes, the acting is bland and lackluster...these people ARE SUPPOSED to be dull and lackluster, they are more or less feminist zombies, meant to appall us with their total lack of human emotion. This is a huge part of the story, NOT bad acting. In fact, if these characters appalled us as much as they did, then I would call them fantastic actors as they pulled it off flawlessly. You're not supposed to like them, people! The story did not fascinate me nearly as much as the imagery, however. The scenes were breathtaking set in a summery location that was meant to be far removed from civilization and succeeded. When watching this film, I was sucked in, completely able to believe the isolated surroundings, adding to the feeling of complete aloneness. The area was beautiful albeit disturbing.This was by no means a life changing movie, but it was a good and solid one. The director chose a path for this film and did not stray from it which is something I cannot say for most directors today who are hellbent on making a film that veers off into twenty directions and leaves more questions than answers. This film was simple and stayed consistent all the way to the finish, though I was left wondering exactly what the young girl with braids and the accident at the beginning had to do with the story. With as many times as they recapped it in Edward's memory I was sure it would go somewhere. No matter, I wasn't disappointed with The Wicker Man. It is always a feat to have only one solid (stable) character in a film and not have it be lifeless. Films with Nicholas Cage are never lifeless as he brings a presence on screen that is believable and likable.Overall, it was a good, solid film. Nothing that knocked my socks off, but it left some gorgeous imagery in my head and as a writer, the visuals in this movie were believable enough to leave me feeling inspired. Perhaps the plot could have been a bit thicker, but I applaud it for not succumbing to America's blatant refusal to enjoy any film without non-stop action and things being blown up. This is a cluster of a movie meant to be be enjoyed by intelligent people who can use their imagination a little more than the stereotypical moviegoer.</fullReview>

Turns out it takes him to an island in the Pacific Northwest-- actually in B.C.-- peopled by a bunch of wacko witches who apparently planned years ago to get him there and lured him by the supposed death of another little girl (was anyone else not surprised when it is disclosed this one is his own daughter?)

The title seems familiar to me, so it must be that I saw the original, but I do not remember it, so I am judging this remake entirely on its own.It is a strange movie as most people are unfamiliar with alternative religions; especially those that are based in nature. These nature-based religions have been around a whole lot longer than anyone reading this, so who is to say they are not the best way to go. There are also many societies in history that are matriarchal. I only mention this, as I feel that most people who dislike this movie are probably entrenched in patriarchal Christian-based religions and cannot grasp the fundamentals behind the story.Nicolas Cage was probably the best person to play this role. he can play over-the-top with ease, which this story called for. He is out of his element in this investigation and it stretched his cop mind to the limit, as it should.The actions of all the villagers seem odd until it all comes together at the end. Then everything makes perfect sense. Director Neil LaBute (Nurse Betty) did a great job of keeping the story moving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I realized that this movie hadn't received good reviews I decided to watch it today (there's not a great deal of HD-DVD movies out yet and I took a chance on it).It was clear early on that this movie would not be good. While that's certainly not my preference it's unfortunately common and I settled in to watch a bad film. But this film raced past "not good" and quickly became very frustrating. Frustrating because there appeared to be some potential. Potential to make a decent film and that's what is so annoying and disappointing.(1) Nicolas Cage is generally a good actor but needs strong direction. The first 3/4 of this movie was way off the mark for his character and was distracting and irritating.(2) Serving up predigested plot only appeals to the lowest common denominator. Possibly this was LaBute's goal as he did edit to a PG-13 to reach the 10-16 market (not exactly a group known for their discriminating taste in films).(3) Burstyn was acceptable in her first scene but became unfortunately mired in LaBute's re-write and directing in the final scene.(4) The cinematography ranged from beautiful vistas to hackneyed "portending doom" and the same is true of the score. Why oh why are they trying to create the wrong tone and pace? As I've only seen the film on HD-DVD I haven't seen what was apparently the "theatrical release." I'm surprised that it would be acceptable to change the ending without any statement to that effect. I rented the movie online and may have missed the box art emblazoned with "Director's Cut" or something to indicate the difference. Nevertheless I'm surprised that there's no option on the disc to view the "original ending" or anything that would even imply that the ending is different. I only just found out about the difference by reading on this site.Very frustrating film. And again - not simply because it's poorly done but because all of the pieces were in place to make, at a minimum, a decent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without question, 'The Wicker Man' is one of the best, most hilariously awful movies I have ever seen. Most of the movie consists of Nicholas Cage wandering around with aimless direction, stopping only to showcase moments of confusion, stupidity, and pointlessness. Indeed, 'The Wicker Man' thrusts all of these feelings directly into the viewer, granting the unprivileged of us the unique sensation of being lobotomized. It's not all bad, though. The movie draws a lot of unintentional laughs, thanks to the sheer absurdity of a few scenes.The only real shame that comes from 'The Wicker Man' is that there isn't a show like 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' to lampoon this little gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Does every movie need to be remade? The answer is a resounding NO. The insipid and tortuously silly recent remake of "The Wicker Man" is a prime example of this. Only the Adam Sandler interpretation of "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" has offended me more in recent memory. You're going to remake a Gary Cooper movie? WHY? Anyway, while the original WM was a cult hit, and a good, eerie tale, helped by a wonderful score, good performances, and a brooding, unsettling atmosphere, leading to what was at the time a somewhat horrific and disturbing ending, the 2006 interpretation is a tiresome and predictable slog past Nic Cage's slack jaw. I'm not playing art-house critic snobby-guy here, either. This movie is absolutely the biggest waste of film and catering I've ever seen.I think Cage has done some good work here and there, and I know actors alone don't make movies sink or swim, but it's hard not to blame him for this. He's just...all over it. His character is gullible, stupid, and obnoxious. And we have little to look at for the duration of the film but his dopey incredulity, abrupt fits of shouting, and the endless brooding walks he takes around the island trying to figure out what is made painfully obvious to the audience, in my opinion. We're not idiots. Let us have SOME little mystery to figure out.To backtrack, Cage's character is a motor cop who picks up a doll he sees thrown from a moving car. The little brat in the back seat promptly throws it out again when he pulls over the car and returns it. As he stoops to retrieve it, a semi plows into the car, and the occupants die in flames, despite his somewhat lame efforts to save them. Of course, no bodies are recovered, he receives a letter, everyone is not who they seem, etc., etc. It's just too silly of a story-line to bore you with the details.There is a weird feminist pagan cult on an island where Cage's cop's ex-wife lures him with a letter. Kate Beahan, who is kind of hot in a waif-like way, I have to say, turns in an agonizing saucer-eyed confused-looking performance as the heroin-chic ex-wife. Any man who would believe anything this idiotic spaced-out twit said without a DNA test would not get through the police academy.The menace is heavy handed, and the clues as to the upcoming "ritual" fall like bricks. We all know the "Don't split up and look around!" sentiments horror movies have elicited for decades. This movie elicits more of a "If you can't figure it out, just go home and quit boring us!" feeling.Just a taste...crows in school desks of missing children, "our hero" punching several women in the face, full closed-fist blows, mind you. Cage's Edward (salut, Mr. Woodward) dons bear suits, commits bicycle theft against the openly hostile schoolmarm, engages in insanely stupid explorations into untenable environments where (guess what) "someone" traps him. A man who states he is fully aware he has a serious allergy to bee-stings somehow manages to ride his bike into a bee-farm and roll down a hill, caroming off hive after hive. He is alternately a bully, a spaced-out hallucinater, and a dunce. The dialog, which I shall not utter here, is beyond belief.The talented Ellen Burstyn is wasted as the sinister matriarch of the island, and given ominous, passive/aggressive lines in a final attempt to make sure even the people who were dozing, making-out, or perhaps building a ship-in-a-bottle for the first part of the movie get it. Yes, old twins and young twins, the gender structure of beehives (drones/breeders=male, workers/Queen=female...get it?). Good god, I hope so by now.Leelee Sobiesky is also a strange addition; she is sullen, rude, unhelpful, moody, and inexplicably tries to talk Edward into taking her off the island. Why? He doesn't seem to have any way to leave, and apparently she does, as we see later. You figure it out. I dare you.The Christian vs. Pagan themes that made the original WM interesting are absent. Why they want a human sacrifice is unclear. There is talk of a crop failure, but have these people ever heard of fertilizer? They're certainly aware of the modern world. And their main export seems to be honey, anyway. At least feed the sacrifice to the bees, or something. The island's cult members seem less like true-believers and more like sadistic con-artists preying on a mental-deficient.When the charming missing little girl shows up and ignites the towering wicker man with Cage's Edward trapped predictably, and almost deservedly, in harm's way, it is like watching a kitten fed to pit bulls. It is pathetic and graphic without being in any way moving.Director Neil LaBute has taken a disturbing and darkly quirky story (think Shirley Jackson's "The Lottery") and crafted something shallow and meaningless from it. It's as if the source-material were shaken upside down until all the passion and mystery and meaning fell out and then was thrown up on the screen. This film treats it's characters as dumbed-down paper cut-outs of clichés, and its audience as unable to absorb any subtlety.There is an attempt at a 'twist' or 'surprise' ending, as if everyone hadn't had enough punishment. I know my comments are scathing, but if we accept this as anything worthy of any kind of audience, we just open ourselves to the next travesty. Say NO. As I watched, I couldn't help thinking about how these millions of dollars could have otherwise been spent. Perhaps on "Stop, Or My Mom Will Shoot 2." I just can't stand it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great story...bad movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some things were ridiculous and so many elements were unexplained and made no sense.The story was great though. How often do you get to see a man be good and women be evil? Granted we might see an evil guy punch a woman in the face but I don't know if I have ever seen a good guy kick an evil woman's ass. It is about time. I don't ever remember seeing a man punch a woman and cheering rather than cringing. These women were truly evil and I think it is a taboo to show an entire female culture as truly evil, even though that does not reflect real life. It is especially taboo to create a single white American male character who fights that evil. It was so cool to see when he started to uncover the evil plot and the possible murder of babies that he would get in their face and confront them and even hit them if necessary. They seemed intimidated. Very rare in Hollywood.male = good? female = evil?Very rare indeed.Was the evil doctor aborting/sacrificing male babies? Why were all those babies in jars in the lab? It's somewhat of a break through for the anti-misandry crowd and those of us who notice the real double standards in the industry. It gets points for being politically incorrect.</fullReview>

Don't blame him for the awful script, if any one can make any sense of what the hell was the point of that movie, give your self a pat on the back. Its a cross between The Village and a crappier script. Its starts off kinda catching your eye, and then as it goes further into the plot, it just makes no sense, and don't get me started about the ending!!!! What was that? The only thing that makes this movie exist is Nicolas Cage usual great humor, and his ability to be funny in the weirdest situations. If you go to a blockbuster and this is the only movie to watch, save yourself five bucks and just go back home and turn put some thing on fire and when some ones asks you why, just say the stupidest thing that comes into your mind, and there you go!</fullReview>

Cage acts like he is needing a paycheck and phones in his performance while the rest of the crew is just there. My wife and 14 year old son hated it too. The scenery of the island is beautiful and the opening scenes of the crash are great, but without those two items, you have a poor attempt at movie making. Will this keep me from watching another CAGE movie? No. All actors make at least one bad flick. In comparison, the original version is the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The beginning was disjointed and nonsensical and it didn't get much better. All through the supposed plot I was shaking my head at how stupid our hero was. It was supposed to be a suspenseful thriller but I saw every supposed plot twist coming. The ending was a surprise only because I didn't believe they would let the movie end with such an empty thud. I had to fast forward through it. Nothing changes, no character grows, there's no moral or impact on the viewer, it's just an "here's an idea, the end" story. The worst movie I have ever seen. At least a mindless slasher movie has a monster and shocking gore to give your spine a tingle. This movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.I rented the DVD (free coupon, thank God) with the "shocking alternate ending". A complete lie -- the new ending was identical to the old ending, with a final scene cut out. This scene was a dull cliché but at least it had two pretty girls in it and so was more interesting than the rest of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Historically inaccurate, incredibly banal and insulting to anyone of pagan belief. Easily, the worst movie of any of these actors and actresses careers. The Wicker Man makes M. Night Shyamalan's The Village seem like high art. Right from the beginning the script is horrible and the acting is worse. The premise, as seen in the preview, holds a lot of promise and could have been developed into a decent movie. However, what follows is just stupid. Maybe, when this story was written and the original movie made, there was enough superstition and lack of information to make this story into a fair drive-in B movie, but in today's age, one has to question not only the motives behind the remake, but the competence of whoever funded this waste of time.</fullReview>

Take the money you would have spent attempting to see this movie, ball it up, go to the bathroom, take a crap, and wipe your ass with the money you have just balled up. It would be better used to wipe your ass and flushed down a toilet than spent seeing this movie. The only good thing about this movie is the production value. The locale's and wardrobe, sounds and environments were exquisite. The plot was horrible which in turn means the acting was even worse because they actually put effort into acting out this horrible movie. Think The Blair Witch, all hype, and no delivery.

		<shortDescription>The Wicker Man: A Mixture of brilliance and awfulness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen the original Wicker Man, a fact I'm not proud to admit as I am aware that it is supposedly an all time classic and containing a great performance from Christopher Lee. A shame that I never manage to catch it on TV as its a movie I desperately want to see. So when I got the opportunity to see the remake I just couldn't resist, I was aware it was hardly going to live up to the original movie, but I just wanted to see the plot and see whether the remake was actually any good at all. Remakes are funny things, for every decent one you get (Ocean's Eleven) you then go and get two along the lines of Planet of the Apes and The Grudge. So as I watched The Wicker Man I wondered what category of remake it would fall into. At first it started off quite well, in fact I was surprised as I was really getting into the movie during the first half an hour. Alas the movie then literally falls flat on its face until the last ten minutes. The dialogue while passable at first descended into horrific territory. The acting was pretty lame, Nicholas Cage practically sleepwalking throughout the movie, in fact only one person showed any sign of an effort and she was rushed off in a couple of scenes (Ellen Burstyn!). Matters aren't helped as we see some of the most ludicrous scenes I have seen in cinema history. Nicholas Cage running through a forest in a bear costume! Oh and did I mention the lamest dialogue in ages from Cage, "I think something terrible is about to happen!". While it might not sound bad written when you hear it you just want to die laughing it is executed so badly. Thankfully the ending redeems the movie quite a bit as the surprise twist and shock finale remain intact from the original (One of the few things I knew about.) Okay then the plot of The Wicker Man follows Edward Malus, a police officer who receives a message from his ex-fiancé. She lives on an old fashioned island called Summers Isle. Her daughter has gone missing and she wants Edward to help her find her. Edward himself is suffering from distress after he failed to save a mother and daughter earlier on in his career. When he arrives on the island he soon realises all is not as it seems. The island is mostly occupied by women, all of whom deny the very existence of the missing girl. As Edward investigates further he discovers mysterious cover ups aplenty and a mystery that leads to something much darker and much more ancient. As far as I am aware this is still the exact same plot as was in the original movie, in fact its actually a very good plot. The mystery element and the actual characters are always intriguing. The head of the island, Lady Summersisle is an intriguing character as is Edward's ex-fiancé Willow. I fact the only one truly dull character is Edward himself. His background story seems more forced than anything else and you really couldn't care too much for him.So what are the big problems for the movie then? Well its major problem is the editing and how poorly written it is. The first half an hour while poorly written contains atmosphere, a creepy scene where Edward investigates a barn really does send shivers up the spine. The editing here is spot on and works brilliantly. And then the director just seems to go haywire with the editing scissors. It becomes more about Edward riding a bike round the island then trying to deliver anything remotely like scares. To make matters worse when the twist does come around its done in such a silly way that its impact is dimmed slightly. The ending is still brilliantly edited and something to savour, hence why the rating of this movie is considerably higher than I suppose it would be without it.All in all The Wicker Man isn't a bad movie, in fact its a half decent one at times. Yet its lacking something to really excel it in the brilliant territory. With a dull performance by the lead, poor editing and poor writing the movie could have been a disaster. It redeems itself with the plot always standing strongly, the ending being a shocker and the actual characters on the island always being intriguing. A shame then the movie just can't live up to all expectations though. Still I now want to hunt down the original and try and compare it to this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is with Nicolas Cage? Is he not in control of what movies he works in? Did he not know that Neil LaBute (Writer/Director) has written 6 films and direct them all to no significant success? He Directed one film that won some acclaim but was lucky enough to have not written it himself. The Cinematographer has worked in 70 films... 3 of which you may have heard of.The editor has worked 17 films and on most of LaButes drivel. Nothing on his resume to even suggest competency.This information took about 7 minutes to research. If you check, you'll see cage is one of 19 producers. Can you imagine that meeting of minds? I think they may have had 20 but the smart one quit on the first day.I only looked this stuff in order to maybe find a glimmer of hope that cage might have had that this film wouldn't flop. There really is none. I also see that Cage has 5 films in production for 2007 and 5 more for 2008. I think he's just cashing in on any job he can get. He's gobbling up some cash and we're not going to see him for a few years.He's really had some stinkers lately... Ant Bully sucked... weather man sucked...I guess world trade center was good. I mean if I say it wasn't then I'm just not a good American, right? Anyway, all Cage did was lay in rubble and suffer for two hours.Synopsis:This movie was bad bad bad. I can't say one good thing about it or anyone that had anything to do with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insult to the original film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second film is completely out of context, in comparison to the British original. Edward Woodward (a theatre actor) and Christopher Lee, are two fine British actors of the highest calibre. Whereas Nicolas Cage has a limited and unconvincing stance, either as a cop or a victim in this rather shabby second version. The first film is quite a brilliant concept, the theme is built upon ideas of the ancient pre - Christian Religion. Which was discredited historically and given quite a bad name. Wicca or Paganism, as it is sometimes called was never actually started as a Devil worship. This is something that was added and deliberately connotated to make Wicca an evil concept. Some may argue, it was and still is practiced as a relatively harmless worshiping of nature and giving thanks to various god's such as the sun god and moon goddess for growth and abundance of crops. It's philosophy 'If it harm none' (basically states no harm should be done to anyone during practicing of its magic, not to be confused then, with Black Magic!) By those British and European people of very ancient and simple times. Who had by today's standards a very tough lifestyle! With no 'Mod Cons'It is common knowledge in England, and obviously something new, weird and completely unknown about in America! Who in this poor replica of 'The Wicker Man' Very cleverly or stupidly (depending on how you look at it, and from what angle) manage to totally distort and destroy the entire theme of the British Pre - Christian Cult film and its Devil worshiping connotations, which (as all educated Britians might know) was originally brought about by the early Christians, to destroy the Cult itself, rightly or wrongly.Also, the film in my opinion as a woman, is offensive to womankind. I would go so far as to say, it carries with it dangerous overt and covert messages to the viewer. It appears to be saying that for example (the scene of Nic Cage having his legs broken deliberately,by women while the 'all women coven' watch and smile and grin gleefully) That in general women are naturally unkind, cruel and insanely sadist. This is reaffirmed when the lost child in question, is encouraged by each generation in turn (Grandmother and Mother) to ignite the fire below her own father. Who incidentally she has neither met or known of til he is chosen for sacrificial purposes.I can see why Edward Woodward politely declined to partake of a role in the second film. It bears no resemblance to the first, somewhat brilliantly suggestive, historically anti - establishment and intellectually stimulating, although slow moving epic. The first film is based loosely on Factual British, theological history and does make you think deeply, if you are familiar with the facts or not!The second is sexist, rubbish, mumbo jumbo and complete and utter nonsense. I am sorry i wasted my time watching this rubbish! I wouldn't even give it a 0. It was so bad. Yes, the scenery and rural countryside was pleasant enough, but when compared to the peaceful tranquility of the Scottish location in England, no contest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; SPOILER WARNING: SOME SCENES ARE REVEALED IN THIS REVIEW &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This movie is in my lowest ten movies of all time and ultimately disappointing for a Nicholas Cage movie; normally, I'm a fan of him.First, would like to begin with the good parts of this movie, the pros. The beginning flowed well and character creation and acquaintance was smooth. I really bought the whole Nicholas Cage as a cop and going to some mysterious, private island, and I was especially intrigued with the car explosion. The scenery of Summer's Isle was beautiful and the immediate Amish sort of mysterious satanic ambiance lured the watcher further into the movie. The bloody bag right when Nicholas Cage arrived on the island got the watcher's attention.But besides the good things, there were three major flaws of this movie, in order of increasing severity.First, Sister Willow, the dumb blonde bimbo who just can't get a single word out, deflated the seriousness of the movie and sort of angered the watcher at her instead of drawing the watcher's concentration to the story at hand.Next, the Pagan feel of the movie. I understand that it is the right and fairness of the producers to make Summer's Isle of Pagan, or at least feminist, custom, but I think that it was unnecessary. By the end of the movie, I was more angry at feminists than the whole conspiracy, and on a whole I think this movie brewed hatred towards women and wrongly so.The final and most atrocious slip-up of this entire movie: the ending. If I were to make the Wicker Man into an analogy, the beginning is like setting the foundation of a card castle. Repetitively stacking countless playing cards on top of each other with phenomenal method and beauty; the end is like placing a bent card in the last place and watching this beautiful set-up crash down in a falling maelstrom of misery. Here's how the ending worked out: Nicholas Cage comes out of a Crypt after being released by Willow from some sort of pool--with a Jesus statue in it?--after which he begins to run around the entirety of Summer's Isle, looking for his supposed daughter. Barging in on peoples houses. One barging scene that I thought was particularly comical was the one in which he walks down from his room in the town tavern to find two of the "sisters" talking about the murder of the supply plane pilot. After the one leaves, the other sister begins to talk to him. He then proceeds to make a swift punch to her face, knocking her out (never seen Nicholas Cage glorification before.) Finally, Nicholas Cage finds a bear costume that he uses to disguise himself in the ritual. Once the convoy arrives at the spot of sacrifice, Nicholas Cage sees his daughter, Rowan, tied to a wooden pole and then presumes to run to the pole, deliver another mighty blow to a poor woman's jaw and run away with Rowan. The dynamic duo manage to dodge the sisters sent after them and then progress (somehow) back to the place of sacrifice where Summersisle proceeds to reveal the whole cheesy conspiracy to make Nicholas Cage come out to the island. Nicholas Cage has his legs broken and he is drawn into a giant wooden structure in the shape of a man (finally, we know what the wicker man actually is) and Rowan lights this structure on fire. Nicholas Cage, along with about ten other farm animals, are burnt to death... end. No wrap-up about Nick's random call to his partner while running from the "sisters," no wrap-up about the strange man in Sister Summersisle's bed, no wrap-up about the bees swarming the bar-maiden in Summersisle's house, no wrap-up about the bloody bag, and no wrap-up about why the men couldn't talk. That is why I gave this movie a one out of ten.</fullReview>

Do not waste 90 minutes of your life!!!!!!!! I am a huge fan of films that keep me guessing from beginning to end. I could not be happier than when I come to the end of a movie and am shocked by a plot twist. However, when that plot twist makes no sense, it leaves sort of an empty feeling. Other members have posted that the set up in this film was great, and I would agree with that. However, it is all ruined in the last five minutes. It was so bizarre that I actually asked myself, "when is he going to wake up from the dream sequence?" More importantly, this movie contains some brutal and explicit violence that is not advertised, nor expected at the time it occurs. This, in and of itself, would have been enough to make me stay away from this film, had I known about it in advance. Let me be clear, I have no problem with violence in cinema. While I have seen worse, this particular case was very disturbing, in that it was un-needed and not what was expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad, horrible movie I will never, ever watch again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, this movie was mostly a waste of time. Although the acting was not horrible, I can't say it was very good either. This movie is supposed to be a suspense/horror film, but at no time was I in suspense or even mildly scared. There are a few scenes that are mildly creepy, but it's mostly a product of lighting and music.So basically, this movie would have simply been a waste of time, if not for the ending. I mean, I can usually accept when a movie ends badly for the protagonist, but when you add it to the overwhelming disappointment of the rest of the movie the ending is no less than unacceptable. The only reason I sat through the entire thing was to see Edward, Willow, and Rowan get away from all the stupid cult followers and be happy. When that didn't happen, I was (no other word for it) enraged.Besides the ending, there are a few other things lacking. Question unanswered. What did the crash have to do with anything? Was the little girl Rowan? Why did they have to make up such a complicated plot to get him on the island? Why not get him when he was unconscious after the first series of bee stings? All in all, I hated it. Avoid this movie at all costs, unless you want to end up screaming at the television.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original Wicker Man (1973), but the remake is very weak. While the premise of the movie is interesting, it is not developed in an effective manner. Nicholas Cage's character blunders around throughout the movie like a moron, ignoring repeated warnings of imminent danger and walking into a trap that an intelligent 5-year old could have avoided. His relationship with the woman is not convincing, and the movie comes across as somewhat ridiculous overall. I don't know how the directors/producers managed to get so many recognized actors to participate in this piece of crap, but I'm sure after they saw the finished product they wished they had never heard of this project.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A stupidly circular, nonsensical waste of time. I was intrigued by the opening sequence, but it went downhill rapidly from there. The plot had absolutely no believability. How can one man (Nicolas Cage's character) continually follow these mindless island dwellers then actually believe it his daughter from the mother who should absolutely been slapped a long time before the plot thickens? I mean really! My wife wanted to slap some sense into her, too. What happened to Cage? How could he stoop to such role in a terrible waste of celluloid. The only redeeming value is Ellen Burstyn. She has aged so well, she is absolutely stunning in her beauty. She could have done better by doing the Exorcist 15, or whatever the next number is. Save your money.

		<shortDescription>Bait and Switch? A deceptive trailer leads to the worst film of 2006</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After recently viewing Writer/Director Neil LaBute's greatly-hyped "In the Company of Men" , I expected this update of the 1973 classic "The Wicker Man" to (at least) have a decent script. Imagine my surprise when this turned in to a veritable laugh fest, from beginning to end. The best/worst moments? Too many... 1. Burstyn shouting "THE DRONE MUST DIE!" 2. Cage muttering "Oh God, not the BEES!" (BTW - What was the point of covering him with bees, essentially risking the death of their sacrifice? Same as when he's trapped in the underwater waterway, didn't these people realize they were a few slippery fingers away from losing their beloved sacrifice to the Wicker Man? What the Hell would've happened to the harvest then? Seriously.) 3. The "shocking" alternate ending (which is basically LaBute copying that one scene in "Misery" when Kathy Bates knocks the crap out of James Caan's legs). 4. And of course, three words for anyone who has seen this film: THE BEAR SUIT! How do movies like this get made?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK I have to chime in here. The Wicker Man is a remake of a British cult movie of the same name. I cant remember the details of the original but I don't think it was as dull as its remake. Nicolas Cage is poorly cast and everyone else is used poorly or not at all.Ellen Burstyn could have done so much more here with a better writer.Speaking of which Anthony Shaffer who wrote the screenplay for the original is credited for the remake yet he died in 2001?!?!?!? Either way the premise for the Wicker redo is not shocking or moving or intelligent.I know nothing about what drives feminist in our present day culture but I have to assume that their ideas and motives are a little bit more evolved than what this movie suggests. Personally as a viewer I would liked to have seen a director/actor team up. As in Burton/Depp-Boyle/Rea you know?! The one two punch knockout that sinks this remake is Cages performance and Lebute. Cage really ruins this movie by playing into the character way too literally. Lebute trys to recreate something weird and its apparent that he has no clue how. I think someone slightly afeminite would have been better more sympathetic in the lead for instance Cillian Murphy. As for a director &amp; writer who can do weird really good man take your pick there are a lot of really good artists out there. Hell forget weird it would have been nice to see someone helm Wicker that understood the source material and could have added a little something of themselves in the process. In the end Wicker Man 06 has no identity. Heres a silly idea that might have stirred'something"up. Why didn't they write the character of Edward Malus as gay? Then maybe those feminist islanders could have attacked him for perpetrating a woman and surprise surprise maybe we could have found out that Sister Summersisle was in fact a lesbian leading these feminist under false pretenses. Thats just my opinion. As it stands Cages performance in The Wicker Man was just one breath away from "Git er Done!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sacrifice in so many ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wicker Man (2006). A sacrifice of your time, money, and intelligence. Makes Children of the Corn a sophisticated exercise in film noir, and Stepford Wives (2004) a brilliant social satire.It amazes me that intelligent adults with sterling achievements can deliberate inflict this stench of a movie upon an unsuspecting public.Specifics? No need. There is no plot. Events do not tie together at all. The "action" plods on. There is no suspense, no tension. The only entertainment value is laughing at the brazen stupidity of the characters and the script. Acting is strictly at the primary school comedy sketch level. I kid you not.Not the worst movie of all time, by any chance. But bad enough to make it a serious embarrassment to anyone remotely responsible for its existence. Bah.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a big movie critic (first post) but this one shoved me to it. I never saw the original, I'm tempted to now though, but...wow. Besides The Blair Witch Project, I've never watched a more pointless and non-conclusive movie in my short life. You invest the little piece of your life to watch this movie and it seems genuinely worthwhile and interesting. Even right up to the last 10-15 minutes or so of the movie it is suspenseful and you want to know what will happen next. Then the downslope of the ending comes. I'm not going to spoil it, but it just drops off. I don't want to start a big religious fight over a movie, but I think unless you're a Pagan and believe in the stuff that's happening, you won't really enjoy it either. Nicholas Cage is one of my favorite actors, and I think that this is definitely a big stain on his otherwise awesome career. Again, I don't mean to offend those of the Pagan faith or any other faith, and I also apologize if I did. This film is just absolutely ridiculous. I'm just thankful that all I did was rent it otherwise it would be on the Used rack at Blockbuster along with a good sized pile of other peoples copies. Thank you for reading my comment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nic Cage goes in search of his lost daughter in THE WICKER MAN and runs afoul of an isolated community of pagans. This remake of an old Chris Lee flick has little suspense and nothing to hold the attention, as Cage literally scrambles about the countryside, thinking he has glimpsed his kid first here and then there. Some of his search becomes downright comical, especially in a scene where he is trapped overnight in a cistern. Cage's character is allergic to bees, and there's a scene involving torture-by-bees where Cage utters what is destined to become an immortal line: "Oh God, not the bees!" Ellen Bursteyn of THE EXORCIST fame is wasted here as the head of the mysterious coven, much the way veteran horror actress Alice Krige was underutilized for a similar role in SILENT HILL. Skip this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was by far the worst movie Nicholas Cage has ever starred in, and has topped my list for being one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Although the trailer makes this movie look amazing and full of suspense and horror, it unfortunately contains neither. The Wicker Man is based on no more than an idiot idea which contains the worst ending that you can possibly imagine. If I had known how bad this movie was before hand I definitely would not have wasted five dollars at the video store. This movie is absolute garbage and the only individuals who would find this interesting would be hardcore feminists and people with no taste in actual good movies. In conclusion, this movie is absolutely terrible based solely on its moronic idea and it is definitely a waste of money.

This movie explains why pagan rituals are no longer performed. They were dopey. Nicholas Cage (who I usually like) is looking kind of old and floppy in this one and the women are just strange...sort of like Stepford Wives.

		<fullReview>OK I saw the trailer and my friend said it looked good. From the trailer it looked like another "Silent Hill" type movie. Boy was I wrong, This was the first movie I actually got mad at. I did a little research and saw the first one did bad due to editing. Same for this one. The story was in pieces and parts had nothing to do with main story. The car getting pulled over had nothing to do with the movie except explain why he might be weirded out sometimes. They keep showing flashbacks of the accident and it amounts to nothing. The little girl's real mom changing her story and not elaborating and Cage just going along was so annoying. Really frustrating to as he tried to get answers and people not answer and he just trusts everyone. The whole woman island and how they lure people in was a bad idea too. The ending was so bad too. I don't mind the hero dying, but usually they accomplish something before they pass. This movie amounted to nothing. I poorly written wild goose chase that ends in cage getting burned alive. There's a lot more that I'm missing but I saw it over the summer but just finally decided to register here now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wicker Man (2006) dir: Neil LaBute I never cared for the original The Wicker Man. I found it slow, dull and rather uninteresting, with the exception of lots of boobies.LaBute has taken the idea and made it into a Neil LaBute rant about feminism. However, the movie tells more about the creator than it does about feminism.Police Officer Edward Malus works the motorcycle beat in California when a girl and her mother are hit by a truck, and the car explodes while he tries to save them. However, the bodies are never found. Coincidentally, while he's on leave and taking meds, he receives a note from his ex-fiancée (7 years ago) whose daughter is missing, and he feels summoned to the location of Summersisle, a private island in Washington. There, he finds that the residents to be mainly female pagans who believe in femininity as God. The residents, however, make it out that the missing daughter doesn't exist. And, with an oncoming ritual of fertility to appease the Gods, will Malus be out of time before the girl is sacrificed? Edward Malus is a poorly drawn Neil LaBute male protagonist. He is the uncaring machismo male who is one-minded and full of wrath. This time, however, he is also dumb, irrational, and makes a lot of decisions out of his character. Acted by Nicholas Cage, the character loses all hope of even resembling a fully-drawn character. Nicholas Cage emphasizes every distinct mood change and irrational moment to the point of nausea.He is up against a man-hating female society led by Sister Summersisle played by Ellen Burstyn, who is still a good actress slumming it in this picture. All of the females have a distinct personality trait but not a full-fledged personality. But, this is the point.And, what a point it is. Reinforcing the idea that women are smarter than men (see The Shape of Things), The Wicker Man sends Malus to his inevitable conclusion regardless of logic and behavioral standards. LaBute adores feminism and hates men. However, he also resents male brute strength over females. He also resents female emotional strength over men. And, this cements his beliefs fully. But, his ideologies aren't even at fault here.The beginning of the movie starts out fair enough, but as the movie pushes its way down you have to make more and more leaps of faith. And then, the bad dialog comes pouring out in the final 20-30 minutes. From "I'm going to find Rowan and what I need from you is to stay out of my f---ing way!" to "Ahhhh, my legs!!" the movie gets some really silly dialog...and considering its a LaBute film, its a shame to see his talent for dialog go to pot.The big questions, however, are "Is it better than the original?" and "Is it worth it?" It is arguably worse than the original. It is vastly different and in some aspects better and other aspects much much worse. But, it isn't worth it.C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Movies Must Not Be Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a real shame that this disaster will likely play a part in the downfall of potentially intelligent and interesting horror films coming out of the Hollywood wasteland.The acting is nothing, the plot is not in the least intriguing (the original was suspenseful and a disorientating roller-coaster on first viewing), and there emerges simply no point or reason for this film to exist. I was angry sitting in the theatre, a Cage fan (though now nearly a former fan) wondering why in the world he did this? Obviously I had seen the original, and just this afternoon bought a DVD of the original and watched it. And you know what? These people were crazy to remake it! Some remakes make sense. Really, they do. But here? It's completely out of context this new one! The original is timeless.The new WICKER MAN is poorly done -- the mystery doesn't exist, the director is a "smack you in the face with contemporary issues kind of guy" with no nuance, and he's completely wrong for this film. He did well with IN THE COMPANY OF MEN, but how in the world, by any bizarre stretch, can that be connected to THE WICKER MAN? It is ludicrous! Others have made that point in a variety of ways, please read their reviews for elaboration.Cage should make a PUBLIC APOLOGY to any fans he has left at this point. You know, people who appreciate that he got behind cool movies like, say, SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE. He should hold it at that castle he bought, dressed in his best Elvis style leather jacket, and simply apologize for what stupid idea this was. He'd win back a lot of good will that way.Are you reading this, Nicholas? Do the right thing and gain some respect back! Nobody cares about the crappy Bruckheimer movies, you took the money and that's cool, but this is something that requires a public apology.</fullReview>

I left the theater simply in a bad mood.The plot seems interesting at first, with Nic Cage as an investigator to find a missing girl on an island. Cage was obviously the only person in the entire cast who could act. Cage makes you laugh through out the movie at how ridiculous the characters are and the environment. They spend the whole movie developing his character and you really want Cage to find the girl and leave the stupid island. After waiting and waiting and waiting for the end, through all the stupid twists. They basically just burn Cage's character alive. Thats it. After all the who's and whats and with all the development of him, they just burn him alive. Waste of talent, development, and time. Bad acting, worse plot, and the worst ending.

Then his ex-girlfriend writes him a letter asking him to come help her find her missing daughter Rowan. His ex, Willow, lives in one of those weird communes where they live in the past and all the girls wear their hair in braid. The plot then becomes "interesting" when everyone in the commune acts like there is no Rowan. Adding to the ackwardness, there are bees, crows and fetuses!

		<shortDescription>O Neil, where art thou?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Neil LaBute, and I love the 70s Wicker Man, but it was with mounting dread that I approached this film, and I was not disappointed. Actually, having said I love the 70s version, I initially didn't see why everyone was so outraged at the very thought of remaking it. In fact, it's quite a sensible candidate for a re-imagining (as they're now so hideously called), and the story lends itself quite well to being recast amongst American cultism. Really what everyone remembers about the 70s Wicker Man is the amazing ending and Edward Woodwards fascinating performance, handily forgetting Britt Eckland's weird, porno folk music video, and the tendency for any actor cast as an islander to mercilessly chomp down on some scenery. So good choice, Mr LaBute, let's see what you make of this, I innocently thought.Good Lord, this movie is bad. It lacks any atmosphere whatsoever, and surely it can't be that hard to build suspense in a film set almost entirely on a freakish, pagan island where the matriarchal rule is so extreme that men are little more than slaves and not allowed to talk. And then all of a sudden, what should be a tract on the extremes of belief and religious fundamentalism turned into a misogynistic diatribe. "Women are evil!" is what The Wicker Man screams. Ellen Burstyn wants to kill boy babies and finish off Nicolas Cage for good measure! There's a feminist conspiracy to kill Nic Cage! And just when it couldn't look any blacker for Mr Cage, he starts punching women left, right and centre. Poor little Leelee Sobieski gets flying kicked in the stomach and left for dead. And you want to cheer! Just like when Heath and Jake get it on in Brokeback Mountain was somehow breaking a Hollywood Taboo, violence against women becomes Blockbuster eyecandy (not that homosexuality is directly comparable with hitting a woman!). "You Bitches! You Bitches!", screams Nicolas Cage at Ellen Burstyn and the mum off Six Feet Under. Serves him bloody right.And then, just when you thought it was safe to leave the multiplex comes the most ridiculous, wink-to-camera, shock ending ever. But I don't want to spoil the end for you. Neil LaBute's done a good enough job of that already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neil LaBute: Witchfinder General</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's try and get through this review without even mentioning the original, shall we?Neil LaBute really doesn't make things easy for himself, does he? Not only does he tackle a remake - never a popular decision - but he immediately reworks it into another of his gender-war pieces, with a dispassionate matriarchy destroying an innocent man for their own (lunatic) ends. He must thrive on the accusations of misogyny - this just smacks of deliberate provocation.Whatever LaBute's motives, however, the decision to introduce the gender aspect was a canny one. Not only does it reinvigorate the well-trodden 'isolated community' storyline, it provides an opportunity to gather together a raft of America's finest character actresses in one place; it's still relatively rare for women to predominate a cast in a mainstream American film (no, really, think about it - how many films have more than three significant female characters? How many have more than two?). So make way for Ellen Burstyn, Frances Conroy, Molly Parker, Kate Beahan, Diane Delano and Leelee Sobieski; only Robert Altman and Pedro Almodovar have had more impressive female rosters.Beahan's striking features, with her almost parodically large doe eyes, provide her with the perfect patina of Bambi-like innocence; her increasingly hesitant mannerisms are slyly pitched between ruthless manipulation and genuine distress. Sobieski seems underused, but the final shot of her, lip trembling, is unforgettable; it almost saves a totally botched final scene (the audience should feel the wheels of a ruthless mechanism beginning to turn again, but those cheesy bar-room guys seem too lightweight to suffer. A little less characterisation might have been more effective by keeping it in general terms). Delano is a memorable if unsubtle presence, although anyone who has seen the 'Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)' episode 'O Happy Isle' might have a hard time taking her character seriously (in fact, the two productions are weirdly similar, even taking the influence of you-know-what on the episode into account). Conroy seems to be having fun as Dr. Moss, and she has a wonderful knack of seeming benign and sinister with the same facial expression. Best of all is the sublime Molly Parker, an extraordinary actress who deserves wider recognition (see, particularly, 'Kissed'). In this film, she barely seems human. Her schoolteacher is both rigid and playful, easily provoked and completely in control, the one woman on the island who seems to get a genuine malicious kick out of seeing their victim meet his fate. The sight of her in her bird-mask, cycling down a woodland lane, is enough to justify this film's existence.I'm less certain about Burstyn's performance, although her low-key queen bee may well benefit from repeated viewings (although - I have to ask - why is her make-up so damned immaculate? I find it hard to see Sister Summersisle applying lipstick whilst looking in a compact). And last but not least, the main man of the piece, Nicolas Cage, gives a really solid performance, bar one line of overplaying (see if you can spot it). I'm coming to really admire Cage - he is never, ever anything less than fully 'on', committed to his performance whatever the film. I can't think of a single uninteresting Nicolas Cage performance, which is quite a lot more than I could say about almost any of his peers.(footnote: after 'Ghost Rider', 'Next', 'Bangkok Dangerous', and 'Knowing' you might say my good will towards Cage has become a little tarnished since I posted this review...)None of this really gets past the problem that the film is short on atmosphere, and the scares are, for the most part, cheap shocks. The bee imagery is fun, although those familiar with mid-period 'X-Files' may find it a little familiar. The film does tease the unknowing quite cleverly, however - those familiar with (sigh) the original might miss that LaBute sets the audience up for a 'Jacob's Ladder'- style twist that never comes (it starts with the hero rendered unconscious in a traumatic accident, he's plagued by visions of the deceased, there are non-sequiturs and surrealism - see also 'Carnival of Souls', 'Dead End', 'Soul Survivors', even 'The Wizard of Oz' for where this might seem to be going), allowing him to slip the real knife in without arousing suspicion.</fullReview>

I can see this movie becoming a movie that 20 years from now, will be compared to Children of the Corn. Nicolas Cage is a cop who is doubting himself when he gets a mysterious letter, with no postal mark; he is led to an island where the inhabitents are mostly female and where males are 'seen and not heard.' He finds the woman he was going to marry, and finds out that she left when she was carrying his child, and that little girl goes missing. He has to find her, at ANY cost.</fullReview>

The Wicker Man was NOT in ANY WAY a bad film, comparing it to the original, with how different it is, will lead people to think so, but it's a very good movie. It's creepy for a movie that takes place entirely in the daylight. Yes, it's predictable, very, but so what? It has a good feel to it. For a movie that hasn't really gotten much attention until it HIT theatres... it's very good.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this film is a waste of any cinema-goer's time and money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been an avid fan of the original Wicker Man, in both its versions (Theater and Director's Cut) for many years, so it was with some foreboding that I went to see it today with my wife (who hasn't seen the original). My worst fears were more than justified, and I can do no more than agree whole-heartedly with virtually everything that has been said in the other comments. It was a waste of money, and I wouldn't recommend anyone go see it; save your cash for watching the original on DVD or on TV. A couple of minor points: many people seem to be under the impression that Summersisle in this film was off the coast of Maine; not so, the film explicitly says it is in the N-W Pacific, and part of the State of Washington. This error could have been perpetuated from a mistake by one of the media critics. Secondly, I've heard that Edward Woodward, the police sergeant of the original, was offered a cameo role. To his eternal credit he had the foresight and wisdom to turn down the offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An example of how to dumb down a good film for a US audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Go see the original of The Wicker Man, it's already in English so why translate it to English and move it from Scotland to Washington (Canada). It's interesting that a Mormon director is incapable of imagining a believable adult virgin character and so has to make unsubtle tweaks to the plot. This film can be summarised by the image of Neil LaBute holding up the American flag whilst wearing a dunce hat and proclaiming that Julias Ceaser displaced the Gauls northward to Washington (a state of Canada). It seems the Pictish folk of Washington have kept up their sacrificial traditions since Roman times when they escaped to America as Julias Ceaser invaded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. I have only said this about one other movie in my entire life, but it has been bumped down, and this has become the new low. Honsetly, I am a pretty big Nicholas Cage fan; he has done some great work in the past. However, I am honestly in shock of how poorly this movie was made. When I left the theater, I turned to my friend and said, "It was almost like they wanted to make it a bad movie, to hopefully make it a cult film, but then decided to keep it the same way and go in a serious direction." I don't claim to be the definitive brain on movies, but I know an awful movie when I see one, and this one takes the cake. Poor storyline, poor acting, poor directing, poor scenery, poor everything.There are exactly three things that were relatively worth watching, but they couldn't even dream of bringing this film out of the dirt.I am sure that the book was actually pretty entertaining, and that the story was as bad as it was portrayed in the movie. However they should have left the book a book, and left that at that. No Movie was a bigger waste of $6 than this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I disliked the movie a lot it looked very very unrealistic. If they carefully plan for him to go to the village, he was not going to go to the school, go to the grave, and down a whole. And even more unrealistic when he was at the dock he saw the girl drowned, then he goes for her, when he woke up he had the girl then he woke up again. The end was horrible. I was guessing someone was going to save him or something I ended hating the movie. I even asked for my $10.50 back but i did not get my money back. At the time the movie ended I was very disappointed for spending my money on this movie. I would have expected a better plot of this movie. Everything was very very unrealistic, the guy is just a police not an investigator. At the end it was very very fake when Nicolas wore the bear suit. The scene before that he beated up too women who were not ready for the festivity they were not dressed up, nor did they have their costumes. It looked like he changed very fast and ran to the festivity and there was the two ladies at the front row, sister Beach and sister and sister Honey with their costumes on and their make up on. It looked very very fake</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Admittedly, I never saw the original, nor did I read the short story. So, I walked into the theatre having zero idea of the plot.So, the story line, in hindsight, had possibilities, for sure. But the acting consisted of 90 minutes or so of overacting. N. Cage must have been bribed into playing the part and his overacting was his way of getting back at the producer. Not one actor did a credible job.Was this a horror story? I wasn't shocked even once, nor did I gasp at all (except at the bad acting).There were scenes put in for shock value that bombed. One particular scene was not necessary to the story, was never explained, and was not even scary. They must have needed an extra 45 seconds to fill.I say, save your money and - if you MUST - rent the DVD which should be out in a matter of weeks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's nothing wrong with a suspense\mystery thriller. This had all the ingredients of a great movie. Chaotic opener, lingering questions, pagan background, creepy island, and a creature the audience would have loved before, but now hates; i'll still drink the honey.Cage does his best to lead the cast, but where he's leading them and why his motives are so strong are never really revealed. He doesn't even learn the girls true connection to him until he's already deeper than anyone should have gone given all he had to go by. It just isn't believable that a bike cop from a small canyon town is suddenly just going to go off and chase after a young girl he, in his first thoughts, had no connection to.The movie plays out well enough with a few well placed "personal worst fear" moments, coupled with those "I can't believe he's doing "x" at "y" " instances (swimming in a crypt at night? digging up a grave alone? going to and staying on that island alone?). Cage's character plays the rational and logical person smacking a bit of mainlander common sense into the crazed society, all the while displaying his contempt and apathy for their ways. He seemed to smart to be so dumb.The ending is, well, shocking to say the most. It reminds me of why all good hero's need to leave the fire-arm's at home and start carrying a sword. Sword's don't need aiming, reloading, or anything but a strong will.Pagan societies will be pagan societies. Despite the movie, The Wicker Man itself was quite impressive.A bitter-sweet taste of corrupted honey for an end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>......Im not sure how, but it could have been.First, I never saw the original, so I am not even remotely upset that this was a remake that may or may not have done justice to the original. Of course, unless the original was as unconvincingly muddled through by the cast as this one, I don't see how it could have.The entire film gives you the "first take impromptu " scene approach, where the actors aren't really trying to act at all, but merely reading through lines and getting their positions on stage correct. Yep, pretty bad.The plot is.......well, about as forced as you can get, while somehow remaining completely implausible even to me, someone who can believe in werewolves if the movie is done well enough. Aside from showing Cages' character a video tape of them burning a little girl for witchcraft purposes, the residents of this island could not possibly hint at what they wanted him to think they were doing any more clearly, which makes the audience reach the conclusion that the policman Cage plays is supposed to be semi-retarded, as he can't seem to connect the dots at all.I actually found myself wondering if the people on the island were getting at all pissy about how hard they had to try to spell out what they wanted the cop to think, to the point they are seen reading books on ritual sacrifice.Skip this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a terrible remake of what is still a rather eerie little movie. For some strange reason it's been rewritten to take place in the Pacific Northwest, where the original nod to pagan deities makes no sense at all. You can understand why the Cage character is bumbling around trying to find out what's happened to the missing child, but why she's missing or what's going on doesn't make any sense at all, even at the end. Not to mention--what's up with the bees motif anyway? Rather than being a mystery, it's just a muddle.The acting isn't bad, it's the script that awful. I feel sorry for these perfectly good actors who are trying to make this really dreadful material work. Was half of this movie left on the cutting room floor? I really wish this one hadn't been rewritten into this sad remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Step away from the bike!!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I'll admit that I loved Nic Cage's early work, Valley Girl - Birdy - Peggy Sue Got Married, but somewhere around The Rock, his performances and appearance began to distract me from whatever I've seen him in. His melodramatic, lumbering performance in The Wicker Man, is one of the main reasons I found it hard to keep a straight face. Beyond the fact that his overly dramatic performance (a homage to Edward Woodward in the original?) made his character very unlikable, his wig was completely distracting. It looked like he cut the tail off a horse and glued it to his head. It also seemed like he was medicated or chemically altered and delivered his lines with a Brando-ish slur (perhaps because of his grotesque porcelain veneers??). Anyway, I'm confused by who his audience is? The elderly?? No idea, but I could have seen World Trade Center shortly after Wicker Man, but I couldn't stomach the thought of sitting through another Cage performance. (The previous paragraph is just MHO.) That aside, the ending is just an unintentional hoot. As soon as Ellen Burstyn begins the "dance" she does whilst leading her followers to the sacrifice, I couldn't keep a straight face, and I was far from the only one. Nic Cage's bizarre over the delivery of his lines had people howling. The last film I went to where that happened was Basic Instinct II. (Basic 2 might have worked if Cage had played the male lead. He and Stone could have spent the whole film trying to top each other in the overacting department.) It also looked as if this thing was heavily edited. And what was up with the guy covered in boils and missing an eye in Lady Summersilse's house? It was apparent they didn't like men much - why would they keep that eyesore around - for a cheap creep-out whenever a California Highway Patrolman comes calling? Lame.Come on, seriously, how can you watch and listen to Cage deliver this howler of a line while pointing his gun at Molly Parker - "Step away from the bike!!!" I went to see this because I like Burstyn, LaBute, and the original film. Imho this is a botch from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loved the original, looked forward to the remake... It's awful.The screenwriter's thought process is clunkingly obvious... change Summerisle's harvest to Honey, and hey presto let's make the hero allergic to bees! Have him experience a horrific event at the start, and hey presto you can throw in loads of flashbacks to jolt the viewer from their slumbers. Include also the most embarrassingly obvious 'Don't Look Now' reference ever ( Nic Roeg must find it all hilarious, or utterly depressing!) and this viewer was longing to see the original again. Nothing against the director, he has a good track record, BUT he can't do creepy! This should have been remade by the team behind British comedy series The League of Gentleman... it would have been freaky! Instead we get Nic Cage dressed in a bear Suit (get it? the honey connection? Whoever wrote this is a genius!). Christopher Lee and Robin Hardy must be laughing their heads off, it's great publicity for their original and I look forward to their planned sequel of sorts 'Cowboys for Christ'.So in summary, this remake proves that the original film was a true one off, just like that final shot of the wicker man's head bowing to the sunset on cue!

Again well directed - But!I am no fan of remakes which are just mindless identical copies of the original,and there is nothing wrong with contemporising them, but they should understand and keep an eye on the things which make the original good. Here the script lost most of the well researched history of paganism and its rituals, in favour posh looking books and 'Buffy' style explanations. Also the ending here was weak and predictable - something the original really could not be accused of!The good acting and filming support what is a weak script, which has - unsurprisingly - Americanised the setting (thus losing the history and pagan roots ) and Hollywoodised the story (no depth and predictable, with the slack taken up by special effects and sensationalism). Hollywood please remember - Jumpiness is not the same as suspense, sudden scares are not the same as horror.In all - well acted and directed, but poorly written, losing all the good stuff from the original, but keeping the sensational, irrelevant bits in.</fullReview>

I haven't seen the original yet, but after enjoying the remake, I really wanna see it now.There were some pretty funny moments in the film, I'm not going to spoil it for you but, it was quite funny. This movie is more of a mystery than a horror or thriller.When the credits rolled after the ending, I turned to my girlfriend and said, "wow, that wasn't nearly as horrible as everyone was saying!" She agreed and I said, "what is wrong with people? I guess they were fans of the original and just hated this because of it." In any case, I liked the remake and I'm definitely going to check out the original now. You can pass on this one if you want, like I said, it's not the greatest, but it has it's moments.

This remake tries to go for a darker feel, which is entertaining but doesn't work as well as it could. The acting, character development, and method by which the story is retold is sub-par.The movie is entertaining and worthwhile to see if you aren't someone biased against remakes on principle.

		<fullReview>All in all, a rather mediocre remake of the super-campy 70s movie of the same name. Much as I wanted to enjoy this film, as I had the original, I can't help but feel that the movie would have benefited enormously from more camp, more tripped-out hippy nonsense, and a little less earnestness.I was pleased that Mr. LaBute was so reverential of the source material, but without the over-the-top campiness of the original this movie feels very vanilla.I'd like to judge this film on its own merits, without reference to the original, but to do so would be even less favourable. The plot is silly, nonsensical and labyrinthine; Mr. LaBute employs shock techniques which a ten year old could see coming; and the final scene lacks punch. This is doubly so because the explanation of the importance of the Malus character is so trite, lacking the poetic quality of the original.I must give credit for casting though, especially Ms. Burstyn, who has a pleasantly commanding presence in conversation with Mr. Cage. In spite of the fact that the social structure of the community is left somewhat undefined, (something that might have been very interesting to pursue further), it is clear that Sister Summersisle belongs in charge.In short, this film lacks all the things that made the original entertaining or frightening, while retaining all that made the original so bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sad to say, I too was disappointed in the film. Perhaps I was expecting a better Pagan connection or more film of ritual. They needed to have someone sit down and explain the male's purposes on the island a bit better or have him see a few rituals (instead of maypoles and fertility rituals, we see 5 pregnant women pass him on a trail and we see a finished maypole in the school yard. The island operated more as a 'bee colony' than any sort of pagan or goddess-centered society.I liked how they had a small tongue-in-cheek reference to the original film when Cage pops out of his room to ask if anyone has unpacked his things and we see a woman eating an apple.However, I feel any dialog they tried to mimic from the original (the school room scene, for example) was inappropriate and out of place.The only scary parts, excluding the crash as scary (it actually just disturbed and saddened me) are these dreams he has, or daydreams, such as finding the dead child under the dock. I found nothing of the film 'psychologically' frightening save for the breaking of Cage's legs to make him identical to a wingless drone. The society did not frighten me so much as tick me off. I was on Cage's side in this film, not the islanders (probably the point that disappointed me the most!) Anyway, this movie had a nice location, but again it made me think of a campground or lake-side cottage more than any sort of goddess/pagan-based society.Go see it, judge for yourself. You may like it, it may work for you. I think for this to become a "good" movie in my standards I will have to watch it a few more times to see if anything grows on me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The commercial shows a promising movie. The names headlining the movie brings one to believe it is going to be a decent move (Cage, LeeLee). With a preview of a truck slamming into a car, followed by a fire, that was probably the most action packed part of the movie.As the movie progressed, I had questioned certain aspects and elements in my head, only to find out I was correct later on, so be prepared on very little suspense and a a very slow plot. If you are one who sees the obvious quickly, then you should do as the first reviewer did and just walk out and go see something different.The end is not what I had in mind, and to be quite frank, I had expected much more. I honestly feel like a refund of my ticket is in order.There were a few funny parts, but save your money folks. Cage is a great actor, but it makes me wonder if he has become desperate or blind with this script when he read it, as this was not his best performance.

All we are told is that the victims of the car fire were unknown. We see flashbacks but none make much sense do not seem relevant to the story and primary plot? I ask myself why did they kill the airline pilot? He was the connection to the outside world for food and "stuff". You have to guess that all the men born had their tongues cut out.... but why? Loss of your tongue does not make you as weak and dumb as the meant seem in the movie.I have always enjoyed Cage's work until this..... his weakest performance but I agree the script and Director left him to wander from a depressed cop to an overly aggressive, panic driven x-cop. (I assume x-cop as we do not have any information on his police status.The bee scene was unreal. Here is a guy who carries medicine for insect bites running madly through a bunch of bee hives.

Really bad. And so, so many with no plot at all. Or reason. This one has both.The island is believable as a religious cult that is hostile to outsiders. If one would say, cults sacrificing humans aren't believable, I do not sign that. Unfortunately those have been practiced, and still are. Oh yeah, and seen so many horror movies, that are completely unbelievable. What comes to the plot, I did not expect it to turn as unfortunate to the cop (played by Cage), as it did. The conspiracy went deeper than it originally appeared. The end truly was surprising, I was expecting this is about saving the girl. But then a classic ending in horror movies is with the victims really meeting their bloody fate and the monsters surviving.</fullReview>

I mean, you get to see Nic Cage do a bunch of wacky stuff like wear a bear suit. I mean, what more do you need? Nicolas Cage shows that he can portray really any role, from something like The Wickerman, to serious roles such as Leaving Las Vegas. People say that Cage's career went down with roles like this, but in reality, it shows how capable of an actor he is. He can be serious in some scenes, to absolutely crazy in another. This is shown best in this movie. From a serious conversation, to the outrageous, infamous "bee scene." It shows the Cage's skill as an actor, and he can really portray any kind of character.</fullReview>

Despite the fact that all of the residents of the island insist that there is no girl, there is a single unoccupied desk in the middle of class.

I've read better twilight fan fiction.The character development is so poor you will actually want Nick to die at the end.Why would a grown adult, a police officer no less, bust into a class room, demand they tell you where a missing person is, then swear at all the children?! This just isn't based in reality.It feels almost like the film was supposed to be absurd (think fly kicking bar maids in the face), but this wasn't communicated to the actors, who tried to play it deadly seriously. The result is a disjointed failure at either.I haven't seen the original, but I felt that there could be a decent story beneath it, it would have just required a lot more thought, characterisation and acting. Watching this felt really did feel like reading pre-teen fan fiction. Yes you might have some good themes there, its poorly developed but given to someone competent it could really be something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bomb remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How on earth is it possible to take an intelligent script with superb dialog once made into a sublime movie ... and turn in into a bomb remake? Everything is wrong. The dialog is childish, the acting hammy, the sentiments phony, subplots stupid, the gun-waving ridiculous, the explaining speeches excruciatingly embarrassing.And for good measure the director throws in a shovelful of supernatural antics which turns out trite and awkward. Nicolas Cage is a skilled actor so how it is possible to make him act like a first year theater student is the real mystery. He has ridiculous outbursts of anger which must be due to misfired directing efforts.On the small scale two pieces of dialog baffled me. The scriptwriter and the director must regard the audience to be incredibly dumb (only an American audience or worldwide?), unable to understand what they see with their own eyes. On the pier Cage makes every effort to look like he is searching for the girl and cries out the missing girls name. But Cage has to verbally assert to himself "where is she?". Oh dear! We, the audience, would NEVER have guessed he was searching for the girl from the clumsy acting alone. Why not dispense with the big budget of making a film when the dialog is ready made for radio? The second high-school cliché is the ubiquitous "are you OK?". If somebody let go of a wind they all rush around asserting each other "are you OK?". Why won't grown- up directors leave out these school theater clichés?The final scene when the girls go pickup new victims is so heavy-handed and overly explained that it makes your toes curl.If you see yourself as a normally intelligent person, then watch this bomb only as a study of inept directing. Otherwise get the original version!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand why all the bashing on it. Okay, I understand this film isn't original, different or innovative, but the outcome is really good and I guess most people didn't see it coming (I'm included).Nicolas Cage shows he's a good actor. He may be a little strange because of his accent, which I don't know where is from, but he acts much better than lots of American actors. All the girls in this film work good as well.This film just doesn't deserve a better rating because of it's date. Many things that may have worked in the 73' movie don't work here anymore. One of those is the cellphone thing: nowadays, if the cop is in danger, he's very able to call his police department and he'll get help in minutes. They all have helicopters and stuff to protect themselves. Another thing that didn't look real: a cop that is a cop always check if he's out of bullets. He should have checked it every time instead of just hanging around as if he doesn't need protection.And I don't support men hitting women, but those girls really asked to be punched lmao. We respect you girls, but we expect respect from you as well.</fullReview>

Well it depends which way you view it. It you watch it for what it really is, a serious movie which is a remake of a cult classic (which in my opinion, many people here hadn't heard of until this was green lighted, but not all, mind), or watch it a second time and view the film as a comedy.I guarantee you will have a better time.Cage is on complete autopilot for this and not even when he is being covered in bees, does he change his monotonous voice. Which is annoying, after seeing him in so many great roles, he could have put something a little more 'wired' into his role.But then the rest of the cast look like they are on some sort of honey/mead high.The story is okay, and the narrative trundles along at a snail pace, but the film does lack any tension or thrills whatsoever.But if you watch it from a comedy point of view, you get to see Cage in a bear suit, Cage roundhouse a barmaid, Cage commandeering a bicycle, and Leele Sobieski (correct spelling?) doing the best passing out routine ever committed to film.Don't think of it as the Wicker Man, think of it as The NIcolas Cage comedy house party.....with friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horrendous movie that delves into the 'so-bad-it's-good' category</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some films are bad. These bad films usually just get forgotten about over time, however some films are just so bad that they go full circle to being good. Examples of this include Battlefield Earth, Silent Night Deadly Night 2 and perhaps the most famous of all, Plan 9 From Outer Space. The Wicker Man is one of these movies.The original 1973 The Wicker Man was a horror classic that played on some very real fears that built themselves up to an unforgettable conclusion. It was a must-see movie. This is also a must-see movie, but for different reasons. It is flat out hilarious. I have never laughed so much at a supposedly serious movie in all my life. The plot involves Nicolas Cage as a police officer investigating a missing girl case on a remote island, which follows a strange cult that incorporates human sacrifice as one of it's traditions. No originality is present in this remake, except the fact that the cult is an all-female cult who believe men are inferior. The blatant sexism here is preposterous.Nicolas Cage used to be a good, respected actor. His previous films such as Raising Arizona and Face/Off were critically acclaimed and liked by many. However in the decade of the noughties, it all went sour. National Treasure was good natured fun that audiences loved but critics hated and with films such as Gone in 60 seconds, Con Air and Knowing it was clear that his career was dwindling and this movie did for Nicolas Cage what jumping on the couch on Oprah did for Tom Cruise.Let me just give you some actual samples of dialogue from this film and yes, these are actual lines from the film: ''No, not the bees, not the bees! Aaaaaah! They're in my eyes, my eyes! Aaaaaah! Aaaaaah'' ''What you got in there(a bag), a shark or something?'' ''Off the bike. Get off the bike. (Shouting and holding gun)Step away from the bike'' This film also has the infamous ''How'd it get burned'' rant by Cage who also proceeds to punch women while wearing a bear suit. The film is worth seeing for it's comedic value. I rate it 1 out of 10 because as a horror film, it fails on almost every level. It is not scary, thrilling or suspenseful. Forget Borat, Superbad, American Pie or Hot Fuzz. For a truly great recent comedy, check out this movie, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

If you have time to kill and an appreciation irony (as unintentional as it is in this film) watch this film, it is truly magnificent; the bees, and the bear costume, the terrible acting, and the comedy violence, beautiful in every way.

Not Manos the Hands of Fate/Plan 9 from Outer Space so bad that it is a cult classic. It is just bad.

		<fullReview>I watched this last night and I've been progressively feeling more frustrated since then that I have to put my thoughts to paper even though I don't think mere words can express the pain this film has put my mind through. Basically the film makes no sense, it has very little plot and is not consistent with itself, there are lots of strange or stupid things that happen in the movie that have nothing to do with the plot either directly or indirectly but appear to have been put in to give the movie a few shocks. Here are some problems with this film: 1) Entire start of movie where mother and child are burnt out in car but bodies are then missing and car cannot be identified has nothing to do with the movie. 2) The "fact" that the letter he receives from the island is not postmarked has no relevance. 3) Everything and anything to do with bees and his allergy to bees has nothing to do with the plot and is completely pointless. 4) The motivational tape he buys at the start and later looses/has stolen on the island is irrelevant filler. 5) All of Edward's flashbacks / dreams of things that "have not happened" are padding to make the movie look more interesting. 6) Introductions of random characters like "two blind crones" who then do nothing in the movie. 7) Everything to do with the flooded underground crypt which he gets trapped in, the rescued 20 seconds later has no point. 8) Why Edward does not consider the child his girlfriend had shortly after she left him could be his, but when she tells him that it is "his" he doesn't quibble. 9) They lured him to the island because their crops failed but the elaborate plan to lure him there was started 5 years before their crops failed. 10) The island being ruled by women with passive mute men as their breeding servants. Why are the men so passive, why are their multiple people who look the same. Genetic experimentation? Who knows. 11) No details are given of the islander's beliefs to explain what they do other than it's something from old Britain to explain the Wicker Man at the end. 12) Why Willow keeps changing from looking a little bit sorrowful to gleefully happy at Edward burning to death at the end. 13) The acting is generally terrible, although this may be a problem with the direction and lack of character to actually act.</fullReview>

I think that Robin Hardy, Ed Woodward, Christopher Lee, Britt Ekland and all that were a part of the 1973 version (a great film everyone should see) should get a free kick to the nuts of "George Lucas Look-alike Contest" runner up Neil LaBute and Nicolas Cage. I couldn't believe how awful Cage was in this pile of llama dung! I wanted to turn the movie off so many times, but I was frozen in awe of how utterly atrocious it was.

You'd think that with a child missing the residents of the island would be a hellava lot more concerned than they were. Willow, mother of said child, was so evasive and came across as such a brainless idiot I kept hoping Nicolas Cage would either slap the bejesus out of her to get ANY information or just leave the island altogether and let the kid stay lost or dead or whatever happened to her. And what is Ellen Burstyn doing embarrassing herself with with flowing costumes and painting her face like Braveheart? The festival looked like a bad version of The New York Renaissance Festival. And how many producers were involved in the atrocity? There must have been four or five different logos on the screen before the credits even started to roll.

This is the most gynophobic movie I've ever seen.I've never seen the 1973 original, but they morphed the original Christianity vs paganism concept into a serious anti-feminism rant--women can't be trusted, women will crush men's if given the freedom to do so, women are prone to insanity, etc etc. The writer firmly seems to believe in the principles that prompted the Salem witch trials back in the 1600's.What a ridiculous movie. Highlight of the film is when Nick Cage starts running around in a full bear suit punching women around. Seriously.Most of the problems in this horribly flawed film came from the screen play. Meandering nonsense. Overall look and feel of the movie wasn't horrible, although director failed to capture the eeriness and the suspense that this film I felt was intended to produce. They hired competent actors/actresses, who really didn't get to do much acting in this except for Nick Cage. He was struggling by himself to make this thing float--I would feel bad for him, except he was the producer for this abomination.I'm really sorry that all these actresses partook in a production with a really misguided message.I've got to admit, it was funny.

Cage fits the protagonist role very well, but I suspect any actor with a hint of ability could have been cast for the other characters, they're all the same - which seems to be deliberate - but they're also all shallow and dull. I personally perceived it to be, essentially, a sound attempt at a Depp style chiller/thriller, and I'm very disappointed that somebody of extreme poor judgement chose to give it a pointless twist that poses a lot of important questions that will never be answered. To avoid spoilers, let's just say my reference to Open Water in the title is well chosen. Oh wait, is that a spoiler anyway? Lets have more Sleepy Hollows and less of these Pan's Labyrinths, vote with your wallets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is the worst movie i ever seen in my entire life, and i will never forget the worst two hours i sat in front of a screen, waiting for something to happen, and ended with nothing but the main role burnt to dust while his girl friend and child watch him burn, i mean what is the point of this whole movie?, i mean whats wrong with nicholas cage?, why is he taking roles like this?, this is nothing but a pile of junk and it only takes few lines for me to tell you the whole story, Horror movie fans, be aware, don't watch this, i didn't take the IMDb reviewers advise so i watched as usual and i wasted two hours, so don't join us by not taking their advice, whole movie is about a cop who goes in to some sort of an island, looking for a lost daughter of his long ago ex girl friend, and some how she appears to be his daughter, and in the end she was a part of some sort of ritual which brings honey to the farmers in the island, so the whole point is bringing this stewpid policeman to the island and burning him as a sacrifice to their god to bring more harvest..... he was so stewpid that he never checks his gun whether is is loaded or not, he couldn't even feel that it was not heavy with bullets, DON"T WATCH THIS,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not like N. Cage that much but, I think, it would be better for him to avoid acting in these kind of movie. The story is not clear from the beginning (and there is no explanation after)(why he goes to the isle, why he lands hidden, why he does not leave any trace back, why he asks only a few questions to people he meets permitting them to give arcane/obscure answers). Finally there is no reason why what happens at the end of the movie could not happen at the beginning. The best part of the movie are the first twenty/thirty minutes, then it starts to be boring. I was so disappointed that I registered with IMDb to rate and comment this movie. The current average of 3.5/10 has a large majority of 1/10 votes so I think I am in good company.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, this is a bad movie and for many reasons, but it has some positive points too. The pacing of the film is executed rather nicely by director Neil LaBute. The scenery is breathtaking as we visit an island supposedly cutoff from civilization(near Washington State no less), and some of the island girls are attractive. What is wrong? Well, for starters, if you, like me, are a fan of the original Robin Hardy film from 1973 then you will be bitterly disappointed as this film lacks so many of the qualities that made that film truly original and a pillar of the horror genre. Anthony Shaffer's original script was bristling with tense, suggestive moments that lead to a quite unexpected denouement. Having seen that film, I and other like viewers are not going to be shocked by the ending. We already know how it ends before we walk into the theater. So for us, the film has to raise the bar with witty dialog, innovative touches to older material, and add in some fresh, fine performances by actors of some ability. This film has virtually none of those things. The script is barren of original creativity and where it does try to be creative it fails miserably. C'mmon, an Amazonian kind of island where men are emasculated and women rule! Bees! Much of the script is filled with lots of nonsense but no passion. The script lacks passion. The direction lacks passion, and most importantly, the actors lack passion. Nicolas Cage is miscast in the Edward Woodward role. He is not able to convince us that he is really concerned by anything with his laid-back, wooden performance where emotion is demonstrated by the raising of his voice. Ellen Burstyn is okay as the "lord" of the island but quips such ridiculous dialog as to take away any credibility she might otherwise of had. The real problem for me was that the original, even when you know how it will end, had sculpted a really interesting character of depth with Edward Woodward. He had a very rigid moral compass and belief system. He was almost a symbol of Christian purity and morality. Here, Cage is none of that. He is just a man with some problems who investigates a missing girl because an old flame asks him to do so. He phones in the performance. The film does not wax philosophic about what beliefs are and what sacrifice really is. It is just a copy of a former film minus the brilliant subtext. What film remake travesty awaits us now? I don't know but do know that minds like those responsible for this film are working on more dreck like this. I too was really burned seeing this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have gained a lot of respect for Nicolas Cage based on his previous films, but this remake just made me ask myself 'why did he bother?' If you are going to remake a film then I'd assume that you thought there was something you could add to the original, or twist it in a way that would give fans of the first a reason to like the remake. As far as I can tell the only notable changes are a shift to an obviously matriarchal society for which the symbolism of a society of bees is evident; honey harvests and the destruction of the drone to indicate fertility. The lost girl becomes the daughter to the protagonist thus giving him reason to find her (like doing the right thing is not enough), and the conviction that the protagonist had any strong belief system to revival the strong Christian faith the Edward Woodward character had in the original. In addition to this the feeling of an ancient Celtic ritualistic society just doesn't come across in the film, it feels more like a twisted 'hippy' commune run by an extreme feminist. Other than these differences the plot is exactly the same, so I ask again 'why did they bother?'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the original, don't see this one either -- see the original.A few weeks ago I hadn't seen either. I rented the original which was a very good movie. It had an intriguing and unusual plot, decent acting, and a cultural charm all of its own. You ended up enjoying the scenery on the way to the destination, complete with memorable characters, and a far more captivating setting.Perhaps if I had not seen the original this would have been less of a disaster. Suffice it to say that it took me almost two weeks to make it through the film, it was so bad. I would turn it off, come back a couple days later hoping it would be better and it never was. Watching movies is supposed to be enjoyable. This wasn't.Cage, is a combination of overacted obnoxiousness and wooden boredom. Imagine a cop that is rude to everyone he meets (after the opening scene), jumps jurisdictions and begins bossing everyone around, and even pointlessly bullies children. By the end of the movie I was rooting for the Wicker Man. He even pulls a gun on a woman half his size to take her bike, brandishing the gun as if she were from Delta Force.Others have detailed many other problems I won't repeat. I would add that I found that the opening scene became annoying after watching it a dozen times as a flashback inserted randomly into the movie. What the heck was that about? And an unloaded handgun that he doesn't "notice" as he moves toward the final confrontation? He is supposed to be a policeman. Even the rankest rookie would check to make sure a weapon is loaded before venturing into what was clearly a hostile and high risk encounter. I only wish my shirts stayed pressed and spotless after swimming in them, fighting in them, rolling around on the ground in them. And is there any man in the audience who can even imagine digging a six foot hole while dressed not only in a tie and dress shirt but a jacket as well? See the original. Don't see this movie.

		<shortDescription>The slow, painful demise of the horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a glimmer of hope at the beginning of 'The Wicker Man'. Aaron Eckhart appears fleetingly, and one is reminded that Neil LaBute was the brilliant playwright-turned-filmmaker that made two of the best films of the nineties with 'In the Company of Men' and 'Your Friends and Neighbours', before churning out the enjoyable yet comparatively undistinguished 'Nurse Betty' and 'Possession'. All these films starred Eckhart in memorable roles, but here, as he exits the first frame of 'The Wicker Man', so does one's hope that this will be as dark and disturbing as LaBute's other self-penned material, albeit in a different genre. A playwright (Anthony Schaffer) after all had adapted Robin Hardy's novel in the earlier film, and the results were, along with 'Witchfinder General' and 'Don't Look Now', one of the most memorable British horror films of its era. The new version suffers from both LaBute's inability to direct horror, with nothing resembling atmosphere or scares, and the surprisingly dull screenplay, which could have been churned out by any Hollywood hack. Sure, he gives us a matriarchal society this time around, a concept that allows him to waste an outstanding female cast (Molly Parker, Ellen Burstyn and Frances Conroy among them), but Cage's character is so irritating and the townsfolk so bereft of menace, that most viewers will simply persevere to see how the ending is staged. And, needless to say, there is nothing in the climax to rival the impact and tragedy of the original. Not as ill-conceived as the rumored remake of 'Don't Look Now' (which, one hopes, will never come to fruition), 'The Wicker Man' will nevertheless join 'The Fog', 'When A Stranger Calls', 'Black Christmas' and countless other pointless and insipid remakes of classic horror films that should never have seen the light of day. If Rod Zombie desecrates 'Halloween', it could be the death knell for the genre.</fullReview>

It did become clear that Cage's character was either going to rescue his wife and daughter and live happily ever after, or he was going to meet a bad end. We all know what happened. I like Nicholas Cage, and this movie was a complete waste of his talent.Things I can't believe: Why would a guy who is allergic to bees (a rather heavy-handed plot point) ride a bicycle into a field full of bee hives? Why would a California highway cop who is hundreds of miles out of his jurisdiction act like such a storm trooper? What are the islanders going to do for supplies after they disposed of the pilot? How did his suit last as long as it did? Why did they need to break his legs? He was outnumbered about a hundred to one, and they nearly killed him with bees.The only purpose of this movie is to get drunk with friends, watch it, and make fun of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie would have worked really well in a different, shorter format. Maybe a Tales From The Crypt or even The Outer Limits episode. The plot, full of gaping holes, left me with way to many "huh?" moments and went on for about an hour or so too long. There were several times that I thought "Wow they could have cut that whole scene and it wouldn't have mattered". That's a bad sign I think. Nicholas Cage has done better, but the script may have tied his hands a bit. Not sure what actor available today could have pulled off such dry unemotional dialog. There were a few times where he seems to forget his dialog for a minute and may be trying to adlib. May have had his career tanking on his mind. There were a few laughable scenes where Mr.Cage had a pained constipated expression on his face for no particular reason. Now I'm thinking he may have been realizing what kind of turkey he was making. Ignorant and misinformed paganism references as well, make you feel like the writer had a cross to bare (pun intended). An unfortunate waste of everyone's time. Would have given it a zero if IMDb had let me.</fullReview>

I had very high hopes which were shot down fairly quick.Unfortunately the previews showed the best parts of the movie and everything else was pretty dull. I even felt like I was going to doze off during it.This movie was slow paced and had me slightly confused. Just when you think it is going to pick up and get better it gets even slower and more lost. I kept trying to guess and predict based on past films as to the outcome. I was unable to do so but it just was not what it appeared through the previews.Overall it is not very good, and I would not recommended it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wicker Man Flamed Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only was this drivel horribly written, directed, and produced, IT HAD NOOOO POINT. I mean, what was the point: don't help out an old girlfriend? Don't visit private islands? Paganism will prevail? What? This entire movie was a bunch of banter by female weirdos in an attempt to set the viewer up for a Shaymalan type twist. This movie dragged on mercilessly and dragged the audience with it every painful step of the way. There was a bunch of meaningless events and meaningless conversations right up to the very bitter, disgusting, and disappointing end.The movie took place on an island dominated by women. These women have chosen to isolate themselves on this island to get away from the stereotypical feminine role placed upon women in the outside world. It is bad enough that the "Village" storyline has been played out, but at least in other occult, isolationist type movies there is an acceptable ending. This movie was so very pointless that it defies logic. I can't believe Nicolas Cage signed on to such a film. This movie was a joke, and what sucks is that the young lady working at the rental store warned me but I didn't heed the warning. I guess this is what I get.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a fan of the original Wicker Man for years, and I had my misgivings when I heard that it was being remade. I avoided seeing the remake because I just knew it couldn't improve on the first one. I ended up with nothing to do one night and someone had rented the remake. I put it in the player and spent the next two hours grimacing and cringing with each lame cliché and unsubtle piece of acting. I began to wonder if it was an attempt to make the original look that much better in comparison. Seriously, don't waste your time or money on this one. It's terrible, and everything about it is about as ham-fisted and crudely done as it gets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cage is fantabulous as usual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicholas Cage is one of the greatest actors of this generation. Cage seems to be the only one who understands that this film can work on different levels, and he knows just when to play it for laughs, when to play it for that action/adventure schtick, and when to play it for straight up horror. Brilliant. Kate Beahan also delivers a very solid performance as Cage's estranged girl. This movie must be taken with a grain of salt, and suffice it to say this is not a movie everyone will enjoy, but if you walk into the theater in the right frame of mind, you can definitely find some enjoyable moments here (not the least of which Nicholas Cage hitting a woman- I'm not sexist, but how far over PC can you go? plus it was a very irritating character that he hit; in our theater, when Cage punched the woman, it got a round of applause. How cool is that?).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE WICKER MAN {Unrated Version} (Neil LaBute, 2006) BOMB</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never had faith in this Americanized updating of the 1973 cult classic (which happens to be one of my favorite films) but, as I lay watching it, I was utterly appalled and disgusted at just how bad the whole thing actually was - easily the most misguided remake I've ever come across (worse even than Tim Burton's PLANET OF THE APES [2001])!!While the essential plot points of the earlier film are retained, the alterations/additions are truly idiotic - particularly its depiction of Summersisle {sic} as a female-dominated society, in which the male population is virtually insignificant and entirely subservient (with honey as the foremost product of the community, its symbolism couldn't be less subtle). Of course, it doesn't help that I personally can't stand Nicolas Cage: despite his professed admiration for the original and his credit as one of the film's myriad producers, the Hollywood star (with all the baggage that comes with such a moniker) is hopelessly out of his depth here; Edward Woodward's bewildered police officer in the 1973 version had strong and believable opposition in such figures as Diane Cilento (the teacher) and Christopher Lee's Lord Summerisle, whose faith in their ancient ways was genuine and steadfast - but the people seen here are merely fruitcakes, and Cage a wimpish hero who can only resort to pulling guns on them (at one hilarious instance, so as to take possession of a bike!), throw the occasional punch (at women, no less) and name-calling ("Bitches!")...Besides, where in the hell is the brilliant dialogue (some of the exchanges here are laughable, to say the least)? Where's the music (which gave the original so much atmosphere and texture)? Where's the contrast in ideologies (Cage's religious beliefs are never once brought up - other than the fact that he's been severely tested by the road accident which opens the film - so that his final breakdown has no meaning whatsoever)? To say nothing of the eroticism which was so integral to the Anthony Shaffer/Robin Hardy masterpiece. By the way, the in-jokey nods to the lead of the original film - Cage's character is called Edward, while the missing girl and her mother's surname is Woodward (there's even supposed to be a photo of him early on, in character, among the missing persons on a notice-board at the police station!) - are as desperate as everything else about it! And there are even influences from other 70s horror classics - such as the crushing of Cage's legs at the climax (THE DEVILS [1971]), the recurring appearance of the girl in the red shirt (DON'T LOOK NOW [1973]) and Leelee Sobieski's leaping on Cage in an attempt to prevent him from thwarting the all-important festival (THE OMEN [1976]). As for the female protagonists, Ellen Burstyn made a disappointingly weak chief villainess, Sobieski (who had been so impressive in Stanley Kubrick's EYES WIDE SHUT [1999]) was strangely flabby and unattractive(!) and only Kate Beahan (as Cage's ex-fiancée) manages to emerge with a grain of dignity from the wreckage.One had hoped that the remake would turn audiences on to the 1973 version but, in the face of the appalling (indeed depressing) results, such a thing is highly doubtful: what was fascinating, powerful and haunting - in one word, unique - about the original has been killed stone dead by this hollow, wretched and totally unnecessary revamping!! The "Unrated" version I watched featured an alternate, "shocking" ending to the one provided in the PG-13 theatrical-release print (for which the violence was reduced but, apparently, had an open-ended postscript added to it)!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well what can I say... This movie started off as pretty bad with the possibility of turning into a decent ending. That was pretty much the theme the whole way through. Any second now it might get OK. I'm here to tell you, it never does. There is an opening scene with a mother and daughter blowing up in a car. Throughout the rest of the movie Nicolas cage keeps having flashbacks of that day, but every time it is slightly different. Do not, under any circumstances assume that this has any relevance to the main story. It really doesn't. It's like they made the movie, but it was too short, so some guy in the corner said "hey, why don't we fill in time with completely random and 100% pointless flashbacks. That'll give us another 20mins". I will admit that this movie, whilst trying to be very serious, does have it's comedic moments. Watching Nicolas cage in a bear suit run up to a woman, who asks him whats wrong, only to punch her in the face and keep going is a crack up. Likewise any other time in the movie that he punches a woman. And there are a few. Now I'm not a fan of violence against women, but in this case the moments are so random and the way they are portrayed, it really is funny. This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that this movie was as bad as Battlefield Earth, possibly worse. Nicolas Cage what were you thinking... If at any stage you might feel tempted to watch this movie, please trust me on this one, don't!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's be frank, people who grade this astonishingly bad film with more than one star must have used heroine or acid while they were watching it. I have never experienced such a mixture of disappointment and pure rage walking out of a movie theater. The first thing I did was order a triple whiskey at the nearest bar to get the weird and even painful feeling of having been mentally raped out of my system. The entire movie is filled with loose suggestive ends to make the thin transparent plot more bearable, but all this does is create the hope that the movie is at some point going to get better or at least that there is something more behind the story other than that Nicholas Cage is going to be sacrificed (which, if you HAVEN'T used acid or heroine, you know is going to happen, in under 15 minutes). Yet, in the end nothing is explained (the female cop, the accident, the meed, the twins, the crow in the cupboard, the bees, the embryos, the silent men, the man with the bee stings, the telephone call during the hilarious bear-escape scene) and what you feared becomes reality, you have just watched the crappiest movie of the millennium, and you were stupid enough not to walk away. To all who have not seen this movie yet, I envy you! Cherish you're ignorance. To all who have seen this film and hated it, I know how you feel! Warn others! And to all who have seen it and liked it, how dare you lure the innocent to a movie like this! If you call this taste than Police Academy 15 must have been an all time classic to you! In short the worst movie ever, on all fronts! Thank you Hollywood!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, this film only got a 1 because thats the lowest on the rating scale. Anyone who rates it above 6 has either not seen the original or is American. Nothing wrong with Americans but we have very different views on films. The entire point of the original Wickerman is to explore how virginal, Christian, God-fearing policeman Howie (Cage in remake,) behaves when sent to a pagan island and about being the minority group and loneliness and translation between two different religions, Rowan is the means to get him there to start the story. The remake is an action film not a horror, and entirely based on finding Rowan, not giving a rats ass about the original story. If it weren't for the burning Wickerman at the end there bears nearly no resemblance to the original. It misses the entire point and shouldn't be linked to the cult classic from the 70s at all because its almost a completely different story. If I hadn't paid ?6 and had nothing else to do I would have walked out of the cinema after 30 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst I've seen in a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start out with, I didn't know this was a remake and I've never seen the original. I liked it at first, I thought it was a great mystery story and sort of a psychological thriller. From what I've heard, the first one was supposed to make a point about fanaticism; this one didn't do that very well (it's a remake so what do you expect), so I was just focusing on the plot, not the supposed message. The ending was the most horrible ending I think I've ever seen in a movie. I hate endings that don't turn out well, for one, but having the main character that we're rooting for the whole movie get trapped, beaten, and burned alive...that is NOT the kind of movie I want to go see, thank you. Call me cheesy, but I was hoping he'd find the little girl and he and the little girl and the mother would start where they left off. So much for my idealism.If you're looking for a really clumsy showing of a deep message, or if you're just looking for a movie to make you feel terrible and lose sleep, this is for you. Otherwise, make your own popcorn, pop in a GOOD movie at home and save yourself the money and aggravation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>some how Hollywood took an English made class B horror movie and turned it through Hollywood magic into a horrible movie. the English concept is sound: a child disappears in a remote village with strange local practises, the type of out of the way place where the locals eat dirt on a regular basis. there's a strong suggestion of foul play either one that has occurred or will occur. yet the policeman invited in can make little headway establishing exactly what happened.in the American version the story drags to the point that it becomes difficult to sit through the film.Hollywood has shown very little creativity in recent years preferring to repackage through remaking old movies or TV shows and recasting foreign made movies into an American vicinage.it is difficult to transpose the English original into an American venue as much of the imagery is laced with jibes at their Keltic neighbors that might be lost on an American or of no interest even if he/she understood it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry to sound so biased, but it's been a long time since a movie made me this angry. I felt entirely cheated out of my $10, and couldn't help but furiously mutter, "That was bulls--t" to my friend, the moment the credits rolled. This movie has all the depth and plot intricacies of baked ham, and one can basically predict every second of this awful film, especially if they've seen the preview. The only part I didn't see coming a mile away was the ending twist, which the film creators made somewhat surprising by having it really not make any sense at all. Perhaps most infuriating of all were the glaring cinematic moments thrown in utterly shamelessly with no point whatsoever but to try to make the audience jump--such as Cage's totally irrelevant medication problem that serves just to allow him frightening hallucinations. I am so mad at this film, all I can say is trust my and the overall rating of it on this site, and don't give the greedy creators the opportunity to take your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another harshly reviewed decent thriller that isn't as bad as they say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen this original classic 'The Wicker Man' that has everyone up in arms about how this new remake couldn't hold a flame the size of Texas to. Perhaps that was my saving grace in thinking that this remake was not bad at all. Of course it won't walk away with any Academy Awards but to say that it is "trash" and "utterly poor" and all the other harsh comments especially simply because it's not as good as it's original. But maybe my opinion will change after seeing the original...until then The Wicker Man is a complex and intelligent thriller with a touch of religious overtone and well directed with an air of mystery and darkness in a world of light. Highly acclaimed director Neil LaBute makes an honest effort to entertain and draw you into this twisted world on this mysterious island. He puts you right into the main characters place as he tries to unravel the mystery which goes far beyond a missing girl. The setting of the film is quite captivating, an island set apart from the civilized world, living in a manner of the old days and yet sadistically following a religious cult.I am not, nor have I ever been a huge of Nicholas Cage. I think he's got an ego that shares too much screen space with him...however he has impressed me this year already with the beautifully poignant World Trade Center, and he has done other great work. He fit into this film very well and played the angry and anxious detective to the utmost. He is watchable and this part was designed for him I think. The entire film relies on him and you are entirely in his shoes every step of the way and things unfold through him and he is a good enough actor to pull that off. The rest of the cast is truly just a supporting cast to Cage. Mult nominated Oscar winning actress Ellen Burstyn makes a cameo appearance as Sister Summersisle, the proclaimed leader of the island and the cult and the spokeswoman on behalf of the goddess they worship. In her small screen time she does very well with her performance, she is an expert in her craft. Kate Beahan does well as the confused and confusing mysterious former lover of Cage's character Willow. Her only role is really to confuse Cage and the viewer as everything on the Island twists into what you don't expect.If nothing else The Wicker Man is a unique mystery that does keep you entertained right up the very twisted ending. Everything unfolds properly and I think all the questioned asked are answered which is impressive and good for a film that is very complex to do. While not all the characters made a difference in the film, most of them do their job very well. Nicholas Cage does shine in this performance and he is good at the part. The Wicker Man is absolutely worth seeing if you want a though provoking intelligent film that will leave you satisfied when you leave the theater. Is it spectacular?? No. It doesn't raise emotions or leave you blown away but it succeeds in being entertaining and keeping you engaged and that's far more than I can say about a lot of other films out there that people see. PLUS the long missing former Hollywood 'IT' girl Leelee Sobieski, who hasn't done a mainstream film since 2001, makes an appearance as well as a disturbed and wide eyed worker Sister Honey. And if you ever wanted to watch Nicholas Cage punch the hell out of Leelee Sobieski...well he decks her a good one. The Wicker Man might even raise some controversial questions about women and men and religion...it's worth seeing...draw your own conclusions and don't let anyone steer you away from this one!! A Solid 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The new Wicker Man movie is getting trashed left and right but that didn't deter me from seeing it last night. I wanted to share my thoughts on it.The original Wicker Man has a loyal cult following of which I am a card carrying member. What's special about the film is that it's so original - I can't think of another movie to compare it to. The fact that it's so different means that it does not have universal appeal. I know of two people who tried to watch it but lost interest in the first act.As a big fan of the 1973 version (especially the extended version), I was excited to see the remake despite the reviews. I really enjoyed it because you can tell that the screenwriter/director had respect and affection for the original film. What the new director accomplished was a tribute to the original with many of the same scenes re-shot. At the same time, he inserted his own ideas and twists which worked for me. The remake by no means challenges the original's greatness. Rather, it has its flaws and silly scenes. I understand how anyone who hasn't seen the original may not be impressed by the remake because they don't have the context to appreciate the redone scenes.Recent remakes that I hated were King Kong and Planet of the Apes. Granted, I'm loyal to the 1976 King Kong and Peter Jackson was remaking the 1933 version. But with all the technical effects of the 2005 version, it failed to make you sympathize with the beast that the 1976 version did for me.As for Planet of The Apes, Tim Burton (who is great) spoofed the original film if anything. I felt that he did not have any respect for the 1968 version as a sci-fi classic.Back to The Wicker Man, I broke down and bought the wooden box edition on eBay. The extended version is so much better I thought. The story makes more sense taking place over two nights instead of one and the additional scenes really help the story line.Anyways, I think fans of the original will enjoy the remake of The Wicker Man like I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, in this review I am going to contain a spoiler so if you plan to go see this movie than do not read any farther than right here.This movie was so bad. It left so many unanswered questions that I wanted answered.First question, Why were all of the men not talking? I assumed that they all had their tongues cut out, because when Nick Cage ran into one, it kinda grunted like he couldn't use words. This led me to believe that they all had vocal cored, because he could make sound. So why were all the men not talking? Second question, why was the doll burnt? I don't know why this bothers me, but it does, i want to know why the doll was burnt!Third question, why was he hallucinating? There had to of been a reason why he was hallucinating. I mean I know he was traumatized by witnessing that car get destroyed by the semi, but there was something wrong with him before that, because he bought those tapes.Last question, and this one is the best one of all, What happened to his tapes, you know the ones of "Everythings OK"? He bought them at that diner and he CLEARLY wanted to listen to them, so why did they disappear? In conclusion, I would not want anyone else to see this movie, because it actually caused me pain to sit for that whole hour and a half that the movie wasted of my life.Thank You</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Look again, it's intriguing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I disagree with the negative reviews this film is getting. I saw the remake today, and I've seen the British classic cult film a couple of times, which I admired, especially Woodward's and Lee's performances. I do agree that the transition to the American setting was a bit clumsy -- the whole commune idea is a bit out of date for 2005-2006 (whereas in 1973 it was very current) and the weird matriarchy/beehive/feminist premise in the remake may have been credible in the 1970s, 1980s or mid 1990s, but not now. I wondered if there was a critique of Mormonism in this film, however, and noticed by looking up the director, Neil LaBute, on the IMD/Wiki that he has split from that church.At any rate, they changed the whole 'fertility premise' for the commune between the two movies in order to accommodate the change in values over time -- and the difference in values between Britain and America. Where the 1973 film was licentious, this one was weirdly wholesome. Where once free love (the basis of the commune in the 1973 film) was shocking, now the removal of men from the process of responsible procreation is the real question in the remake. I did not find that part believable. Modern masculinity may be going through a crisis because of feminism and modern life, but it isn't going to become redundant.The film is well shot, and the colours -- I've rarely seen so many levels of pink, green and gold in one movie, with the colours still being innocuous -- are just beautiful. Very very dreamlike, and I noticed that the colours get more monochromatic in gold as the end approaches. It is far more polished in terms of lighting and cinematography than the 1973 film. But the key to the film's success -- which I think will become apparent to viewers over time, is the innovative treatment of human relationships in the story by the director, Neil LaBute. In the first version, the policeman is anonymous to the island, he is merely driven by his commitment to his job, upholding the law, and his private religious faith and his own virginity. He dies not just because he goes to the island, but also because he refuses the temptation of the barmaid and remains a sexual innocent. If he had only had sex with her, he would have saved himself! That is a pretty typical example of British irony. I think such irony would have been more than lost on American audiences and would have been counter-intuitive when displayed in an American context.In a way, the remake is far more interesting in terms of casting Cage as the father of the missing little girl. He has a personal stake in what happens that is far more profound -- and the fact that he returns to find the girl's mother Willow shows that he is already a marked man because he can't get over his past. He is doomed because he cannot get over that one relationship with someone who has already treated him unforgivably. The fact that he obviously hopes to save the girl, and leave with Willow (who is clearly a bad deal all the way through), and have a second chance at having a real family shows how profoundly low his self esteem is. That IS interesting. The question at the heart of this film really is: what's more important? Standing up for yourself and living a boring, mundane, yet safe life (presumably with his fidgety policewoman partner)? -- Or going like a moth to the flame with the slimmest of hopes of re-finding and saving your doomed lost dreams, with the slightest of chances that they just may come to life and it all may work out in your favour? Cage's character picks the latter option, and that error in judgement proves his undoing. Underneath the story, the film is really remarking sadly about what is done to and thought about the real dreamers in our society: they are weak and deserve to die. I think that's a message that we should all pause and reconsider.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nailing it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me say that I never follow other people's advice or reviews on films (or books, or art of any kind). I disregard the views of another when it comes to art, politics or religion. I recommend you do the same. The quality of your life will greatly improve. Why do I say this? Because the heart, that funny little muscle in your chest, is wonderfully more equipped and experienced than any blowhard, expert, or time-wasting pseudo critic. Speaking of time wasting... I'm amazed at the current trend for people to use phrases like "I want my two hours back", or "two hours of my life gone forever" after watching a bad, very bad flick.Give me a break. If you are so concerned about that lost time, then don't compound it with a comment that took you probably at least another hour (or two, or three?) to write and upload. What makes it even more ridiculous is that those are usually the longest reviews, and ones which include character names 'in toto'. This isn't a casual viewer we're talking about here. This was someone who took time, a lot of time, to make sure their facts about the film were correct, almost as if they felt that their critique, if flawed in any way, would be discounted and people would instead stampede to said film like mindless cattle down a freshly mown hill (by the way, that metaphor took me about 3.5 minutes, if anyone is counting).The two hours you may have spent watching a bad movie are nothing, absolutely nothing compared with the hours, days, weeks, months of your life that you've spent picking your nose, scratching yourself, taking that clear plastic collar shape retainer out of dress shirts, or reading comments like the one you are reading now.Which leads me to my next point. Many of the same reviewers, comMentors, and pseudo critics, are the ones who suggest other avenues to pursue in lieu of watching a film like the one they are advising you not to watch (which they just watched). Examples that come to mind are: "go read a book instead", "go out for a walk", etc. All good ideas in their own right, and ones which need no advertisement of incentive to to engage in. So, why do they advise us about such commonly known activities? Is it that they are afraid that you might actually like the film? Perhaps. But I think they are certain that their review should reside under glass somewhere as the definitive example of dissuasion (not sure if that's a word, but don't want to waste your time or mine looking it up. Besides, I'm on a roll!). Perhaps they feel that no other reviews should come after theirs. That theirs should be the last word on the subject. In other words, as far as reviewing that particular film, they've "nailed it" (another phrase, overused and awful). "Nailing it", implies the quintessential, the ultimate, the perfect. Newsflash: In art, there is no such thing. If it were about pounding nails into wood, then they'd be correct. But Norm Abrahms aside, avoid taking advice from anyone who uses that phrase, or the ones mentioned above, or for that matter, mine.Now, go out and enjoy a bad movie. You'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is great, i enjoyed every moment. I was shocked to see the ridiculously low rating it has on IMDb, i don't care much about all the non significant criteria for professionally criticizing movies cause they are BS, what matters is the whole package, and by that i don't mean to say that i admin its bad in those criteria i just mean that i don't mind burdening my mind with such useless BS, what matters is do i enjoy myself watching the movie or am i bored while watching it or parts of it, maybe people hate the movie because the have seen the original and they are unwilling to open their minds to anything different, maybe they just see everyone vote low and they are afraid of saying what they think so people want say they are stupid, anyway i have seen many movies and almost always movies i thing are very good are also rated very good on IMDb, also i am not a professional in cinema (thanks god for that otherwise i would be concentrated on BS non significant intelligent-wannabe criteria other then pure enjoyment)and to my opinion this movie is a beauty! its fun, its suspenseful, its shivering, its surprising (i didn't see the original so didn't know what to expect) and it lives you shocked. and of course i am talking about the whole package (geshtalt style) and not about the different non-significant-by-themselves criteria like acting, script, sound, directing, plot, character development and cetera and cetera. forgive my spelling i am not native English.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Cat's eye comment...)Nick Cage is in this movie somewhere. His role is to be the noir detective in a simple way. He thrashes about and hallucinates. He makes noise. There are some other colorless characters who do ordinary movie things.The real center of this movie remains hidden except for a brief period at the beginning and end. Its a little girl, Rowan, the daughter that Nick Cage's character has but did not know of. She's independently the mystery. She is missing, and folks on the island seem to be covering up something. Also independently, she is a sort of magical presence who really does pull supernatural forces to make happen what we see.She is the goddess who ruins the crops and ruins her father to save them. She is the one who long after she would have been born, wills herself into existence to trap him, even though he is not a believer. She is the one who can cause big things, disappear, carry evil and still seem charming (in a German sort of way). This is her story, her fire. Herself as her wan mother's infertile sex.The differences between this remake and the original are all geared toward supporting her. Its an island controlled by women this time and there is this Bee Business. The girl has made herself his child this time. Previously, it was his Christianity that was his confusion. Now it is simply that he was chosen.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe the low overall scores for this movie. I thought it was suspenseful, shocking,and the acting was excellent. Cage was never in better form. Burstyn was pure evil. The whole concept of being trapped on an island with an isolated cult and their weird culture was ominous. The cellphone didn't work and there was no way to recharge it anyway. Cage confronted these weird people and slowly began to unravel. One shocking moment early on in the film takes your breath away and keeps it. This movie was intelligent, subtle, well-paced, and involving. I would recommend it. The original Wickerman, made some 30 years prior was better, and took a different take on the cultists. This one followed faithfully the key scenes from the original and was still very innovative.Cage's a acting was very emotional and realistic.</fullReview>

The only bad part of this movie is that once you see it, it becomes a lot less exciting, because you know what is going to happen. And I must say, the end is rather surprising and disturbing. I really do not know what else to say, but since my comment has to be 10 lines, I will proceed to tell you that you should go see this movie.

		<shortDescription>Good, much better than I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the typical scepticism of someone who has seen and admired the original, I wasn't expecting that much of this film, but the reviews I read suggested it may be worth a look. I found the original a haunting and tricky movie in many ways, and was fully prepared for a dumbed down version. What I got was a slickly filmed and credibly spooky horror, which was sufficiently different to the original as to hold my attention until the climax.As already stated in a review here, the scenery and cinematography is stunning, and although I didn't think the plot was quite as clever as the original, the professional style of the acting and filming more than made up for it. God bless Hollywood! Not quite as haunting as the original, but is this because I'd seen it before? Well, that can never be known, but whether or not you saw the Edward Woodward version (and as this film makes clear - it is after all Woodward's film when all's said and done) this film is an intriguing way to spend an enjoyable couple of hours without disappointment. I'm not sure I liked the final twist as don't think it added anything to the film, and the viewers' imagination could probably add that in anyway, but it didn't spoil the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously, the 10-year-old "The Wicker Man" starring Oscar winner Nicholas Cage is not a perfect film by any means, but it looks a lot to me that this one has been voted down by pretentious retro intellectuals who think only because an original film was good, it must mean automatically that a modern remake is bad. This one here is not. It was written and directed by Neil LaBute and runs for 100 minutes. The core story is a cop who arrives at a mysterious island obviously controlled by a community of cult-like women. He is in charge of finding out what happens to a missing girl and gets involved deeper and deeper in the mystery of the island.There were a couple parts that did not work entirely for me, for example the part about him being the father to the girl and the masks in the end also looked a bit ridiculous, but we have to keep in mind that the women on the island were all complete lunatics and did not see how ridiculous their actions were as if they were on some drug or something. Anyway, the setting makes this one a fairly atmospheric watch and I thought most of the performances were pretty good. Cage always delivers basically, especially when he plays cop characters. And I also liked the ending somehow. It goes against the traditional idea of how films have to end happily or on a positive note at least and this one here is the exact opposite. The epilogue with James Franco was not really necessary, but oh well, it's not bad enough to destroy the film either.As a whole, do not be fooled by the rating here on IMDb or the film's reception by critics. This is far from a failure and has some really good moments occasionally, even if there is a bad one here and there too. But all in all, the good outweighs the bad and it is a decent watch if you are interested in mystery with a touch of supernatural and horror phenomenons. Or if you simply love Nicholas Cage. Thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Drone of A Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>drone: 1. A male bee, especially a honeybee, that is characteristically stingless, performs no work, and produces no honey. Its only function is to mate with the queen bee 2.To make a continuous low dull humming sound 3.To pass or act in a monotonous way Any or all of the above definitions are apt for this utter farce of a remake of the 1973 cult classic. As a comedy it does the job very well especially in the penultimate scenes where Nicolas Cage kicks a couple of women who get in his way and dons a bear suit to join a parade of paganistic and predominantly female islanders in an attempt to rescue his daughter from being a human sacrifice to the nature gods. Unfortunately for him, things are not what they seem and he realizes too late that he was the intended victim all along.The misogynistic outlook of director LaButte is clearly evident in portraying the women of Summersisle island as a domineering self-contained self-righteous heartless lot who have absolute control over the few men that do inhabit the island, enslaving them and rendering them speechless by removing their tongues. Far cry from the 1973 original where both genders are treated as equals and respected in whatever occupations they practice.The spiritual overtones of the original film are non-existent in this remake. Sergeant Howie in the 1973 version could come across as having died a martyr to his (Christian) faith and even Lord Summerisle commends him for this before having the former consigned to be a living sacrifice to propitiate the nature gods. But in the remake, Cage as Edward Malus is simply another sacrificial lamb along with the other creatures confined within the wicker man. There's no chanting of ancient hymns, dancing around maypoles nor feasible explanations for performing certain rituals as in the previous version. Which might pose a problem for those who haven't watched nor are aware of the 1973 original.And there's the opening scene with Edward Malus witnessing the car accident involving a mother-daughter pair and subsequent flashbacks that he experiences afterwards which affect him so much he's had to take medication. The significance of this to the main storyline is poorly if ever explained and eventually forgotten as the plot thickens.Why the police force would allow one of its members who is clearly psychologically and emotionally disturbed to go on a missing person case is beyond me.And the statement he utters when he's in the wicker man and his daughter rushes up with a burning torch "Put it down HONEY" is just so appropriate. Or poor choice of words depending on one's viewpoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1973. While "The Exorcist" was scaring folk back into churches, "The Wicker Man" was doing the opposite. Both films saw foot-soldiers of Christ attempting to save little girls from supposedly "demonic" forces, but with "The Wicker Man" you're practically invited to root for Christ's fail.Like many films of its era (even such innocuous ones as "Kramer vs Kramer"), "The Exorcist" was an unconscious reaction to a bevy of changes rocketing across American society. Though marketed as "shocking" and "new", these films typically put forth very conservative messages, attempting to restore a pre-counterculture order in which daddy is boss, children don't swear, mommy doesn't work, sex and science are bad and everyone believes in God."The Wicker Man", of course, is a British film, so (like Ken Russell's "The Devils", released 2 years earlier) you get a slightly more pessimistic take on the period. Unlike "The Exorcist", which might have well been a Vatican propaganda piece, our religious hero here is a prudish chump called Sergeant Howie. Howie's shown to be completely impotent, incompetent, dies in a flaming pyre, is not miraculously saved by God, and the film's bad guys are the kinds of superstitious, religious nut jobs who were presented as the good guys in "The Exorcist". Their religion founded on an radical abstinence from sex, yet overflowing with a repressed sexuality in which phallic symbols are worshipped and little boys sing songs about impregnating women, the film's religious cult represent a kind of demented patriarchy in which God and Daddy protect villages from drought and misery, providing you remain steadfastly devoted to all things phallic.Directed by Robin Hardy and starring Hammer Horror legend Christopher Lee, "The Wicker Man" is today regarded as a classic of British horror. Its climax in particular is one of cinema's great sequences: it's a creepy, memorably directed set piece in which Howie confronts a religious cult. Slowly and slowly the sequence mounts, Hardy's imagery becoming increasingly bizarre (men in dresses, animal costumes, pagan dancing, giant wicker statues) such that it eventually creates a kind of ontological shock. "I believe in the life eternal as promised to us by our Lord, Jesus Christ!" Howie repeatedly yells, as he's cremated alive, "Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, Jesus Christ!" But God doesn't answer. The film ends with a kind of reversal of the Spanish Inquisition, our religious hero revealed to be as fanatical and psychotic as that which he denounces, sacrificed as a heathen by heathens themselves.Decades later "The Wicker Man" would be remade by Neil LaBute, who has made a career writing stories which play with, wallow in, reverse and test sexist, racist and classist stereotypes. With "The Wicker Man" (2006) he throws out the original's patriarchal cult and replaces it with matriarchal communes and rampant misogyny. In LaBute's hands Howie becomes a character played by Nicholas Cage, an apparently noble, self sacrificing cop. Meanwhile the pagan cult is revealed to be a matriarchy where women run things and men serve only as manual labourers. Much of the film takes deliberate swipes at both feminism and femininity in general, with school girls literally chanting "phallic symbol!" and laboratories filled with jars of dead foetuses. Women, the film says, use their control over human reproduction to keep men out of the loop, stupid and at their feet. They are scheming, cruel and devious, and adept at using man's protective instincts against him. This is all encapsulated by an early scene in which Cage picks up a child's doll on the highway after it has flown out of a car window. He pulls the car over and hands the doll back to its owner: a rude little girl who reveals herself to be ungrateful. Later Cage risks his life to save the girl from flames (foreshadowing his own fiery encounter late in the film). Masculine nobility, the film says, is co-opted by the evil inherent to females. "You bitches! You bitches!" Cage spends the second half of the film screaming, his masculine weapons, status as a police office, fists, technology and bravado unable to hold back the might of womanness.While the film says women are a loose commune of praying-mantis-like feminist harpies who lure men into their web, use their sperm (literally) and then burn them alive in big wicker cages, LaBute also seems to suggest that much of this lady-hatred is something already latent in Cage. The film itself may be Cage's ? recently burnt by an ex lover - sexist fever dream. Though denounced as being misogynist, the film seems (but not necessarily; I dare not watch it again to find out for sure) to be portraying the exaggerated, worst fears of a misogynist (Cage) and the worst case scenario of extreme feminism. Of course most of LaBute's plays and films ("Fat Pig", "Some Girls", "Reasons to Be Pretty", "Company of Men") are implicitly about abuse, and attempt to critique rampant sexism. These critiques mostly backfire, though at least LaBute is an equal opportunity offender, oscillating between films in which whites abuse blacks, blacks abuse whites, fat people abuse skinny people and vice versa, women abuse men and men abuse woman. There's something systematic about LaBute's projects, successive films and plays deliberately presenting the opposite of that which went before (consider the way race relations are reversed in "Lakeview Terrance" and "Death at a Funeral").Regardless, LaBute's remake is horrendous. LaBute's not a strong visualist and much of his film is unintentionally funny, though not silly enough to be enjoyably camp.5/10 - See the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does Labute's vision surpass the original? What do you think?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood's flash of remakes isn't a flash at all. It's been going on for quite a few years now and some see it as a quick way to re-market a classic when it isn't needed. If only appreciators of the original films had the guts to admit to themselves that they are slightly curious to what a modern look to a classic tale has to offer them.It's a lot easier to say that a film, which has stood the test of time, as well as gained a strong backbone of fans, can never, and should never be remade. However it is a lot harder to swallow your pride and see for yourself. The most pleasant way to view this predicament, is to think of these remakes as the only way for a great story to reach a younger audience who deserve to see a cracking good film. With little hope of them digging through old video collections, or purchasing the over-priced 2-disc DVD, we can only assume its easier for them to sit back and enjoy a modern revision through a lens they understand.The new film to try and do this is "The Wicker Man' starring Nicolas Cage and Ellen Burstyn. Based on the 1973 British cult classic of the same title, the film looks to blatantly Americanise the original story of a police officers search for a missing girl, on an island inhabited by locals who follow a mysterious religion. The investigation is set under way, and our protagonist uncovers a strange trail of lies, which leads to a truly bold climax of cinematic horror and deception.Various changes to the script are made off course like most remakes and for the first 25 minutes this plays out well. The changes will be noticeable to those familiar with the story, the most obvious one being that director Neil Labute sets his scene in America just off an Island in the state of Washington, as apposed to the original taking place on an Island in Scotland. Nicolas Cage does his best as the eager police officer, and his enthusiasm for the role overflows to a degree where he really leads blind to how awful this film really is. Ellen Burstyn is convincing as the town leader and you can't argue that she was a bad choice for this new idea. She adds her own contrasting approach to a very different film, and it's a relief to see another person who can act in the picture, even if you are scratching your head wondering why she signed on for it in this first place.Tragically this film has nothing else going for it, and the director falls flat when it comes to directing his supporting cast, which was the key to successfully misleading the audience in the 73' version. Your left feeling angry and unfulfilled at how a decent character could be mislead so easily and unrealistically in this contemporary world, and this is a character played by a good actor no less. An actor who also thought it'd be a good idea to co-produce this abysmal calamity of film. As a stand-alone film this movie has a lot to answer for, which it really has no power or will to do so. As a remake of an oldie, you'll be injected with frequent spontaneous moments of discomfort and queasiness in amounts guaranteed ruin any film fans evening.The only way to deal with this feeling is to head down to your local retailer and snatch the closest copy of Robin Hardy's version if you haven't already seen it. For those already in possession of the film, hold it tight and ease your suffering as you sit down to watch it one more time. Both choices will make you realize how a remake has pushed you to love the original even more so unintentionally. Well at least it's good for something. Are such statements too harsh?? I think not. Find out for yourself and don't say I didn't warn you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually, I did not like this movie too much, but I am reading the reviews and they make me want to like the movie just so that I do not have to associate with the people who trashed it. First of all, I never saw the original. OHHH I know. That is apparently blasphemy! Too Bad! I didn't see it and I may if it ends up on my TiVo, but I don't know why 80% of the criticism of this movie is about not living up to the original. It just seems pompous to me as if the critics are making sure the world knows "I saw the original and it was much better". Then I saw some people who obviously are Bee experts because they somehow knew what was going to happen when Nick Cage killed the bee at the bar. SORRY, but what little I learned about bee colonies I FORGOT 20 years ago. And while I did guess what was going to happen at some point, it WASN'T because of any bee references. Sorry. I didn't know you needed a degree in science to watch a horror movie. And I hope I am wrong about this, but it seems like everyone hated the end because the hero didn't win???? REALLY????? REALLY????? It is a horror movie after all.Now on to my criticisms. I hated how carefully they explained the plot at the end when they trapped Cage. I just hate movies that are written for people who can't understand stuff on their own. All that was needed was the little girl to say to her mom "Mommy, did I do it right" and the whole plot should unfold for anyone of average intelligence. Then, the final slap in the face was the end sequence. As soon as I saw "6 months later", I knew exactly what was going to happen. I would have actually been OK with that scene being left in, IF they didn't do that play by play explanation earlier. That would have been a good way to let the people who didn't quite understand what happened catch up.I thought is was OK and the story was sufficiently interesting. I will watch the original to see how I feel then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many loose ends?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw both versions and though there may have been differences in the presentation of details, neither one really connected the beginning to the middle to the end of this movie. The more one tries to make a linear, coherent story line out it, the more one becomes aware that there are additional little "loose ends" apparently just thrown in to "hang."Was the sheriff being tested to see how far he was willing to go in saving a child in the beginning? Could he not have been contacted to start the search just on the basis that he had already been chosen to be the father years earlier? Since no bodies were found in the wreck, are we to assume that these particular Wicca actually possessed supernatural powers? When our hero inquires about what happens to male offspring he accepts the non-answer without a blink. Is finding a missing girl more important than uncovering continuous infanticide? What is the connection with the doll and the red dress all about anyway? Does the woman out farming that appears to be almost identical to the schoolteacher indicate another unexplained mystery? Is that the old man that flew him lying in that bed and just why is he there? Or is he instead the one with the bloodied face he finds on the beach?I just don't have the time to view both versions again to see if I have missed some of the connections. I also don't care of I had failed to view them the first time. A bit of a disappointment. The alternate ending with the two women apparently out to get pregnant in the outside world is either an poor set-up for a sequel or merely an indication that the kook group is getting prepared for some future bad crop. But then of course that's the way everyone gets pregnant in that society-or is it? By now do we care?</fullReview>

We will tell the truth that Cage's actually a VAMPIRE, so he did not die in the first episode. And now, in the 2nd episode, all that he want is: to kill all the people on this island, in the way he prefer.Of course Cage has the priority, the little girl will be missing at first, and the story made up by the island people become true step by step... "Some Sacrifices Must Be Made, some people must be killed" If the script of the 2nd episode is like this, I will spend $20 to watch that movie.</fullReview>

I only give this movie a 3 because the cinematography and music are very good. The music is done by David Lynch's usual composer Angelo Badalamenti and is way better then the movie deserves. The movie is not remotely scary and you can spot the trick ending in the first 20 minutes. The acting by Cage was as bad a Tom Hanks in DaVinci Code. Two usually good actors who forgot how to act, how strange. Ellen Burstyn is wasted as well as Lelee Sobieski, two actresses I usually enjoy immenselyI'm really getting sick of remakes of horror movies. Hopefully Cage can redeem himself with Ghostrider.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A couple of things: Malus is Latin for "apple", or crabapple, anyway. Possible link to original film's apple orchards.The bf and I recognized the score as being a fairly blatant rip-off of the soundtrack from "Messiah of Evil", another "horror" film that was more comedic than spooky.Nic Cage is known for weird performances but this one was freakish. His lisp has never been as noticeable and his speech patterns were almost Jimmy Stewart-esquire. "Ah, musht be ladiessh night." His stumbling drugged aspect after emerging from Ellen Burstyn's lovely house was amusing (as was Willow's through-out the film. Her lips were maybe supposed to be bee-stung but I think they overdid it. It was quite distracting.) His frequent outbursts and screaming fits ("GodDAMNit!" just what I always scream after an annoying double hallucination) only added to the laffs. The pill-popping, too. A tour de force all around.I like the unexplained: twins, the egg symbol on the school house door, why women would keep men with no useful tongues around, why Nic kept checking his stupid cell phone. The dripping burlap sack must have been intended as a flash-forward to the end. I'm glad the girls from the car crash and the lady cop showed up on the island as I'd been wondering why they'd been in the film at all.Could the epilogue mean we can look forward to a sequel? Oh boy! We can hardly wait for more LaBute anti-Mormon symbolism. I could have done without all the "Don't Look Now" rip-offs and idiotic nocturnal crypt-swimming and just jumped right to the fisticuffs and bear-suit shenanigans: top quality.My fave: "Aaahhh! Killing me ishn't going to bring back your goddam honey! Aaahhhh! Aaaahhh! My legsh!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wickeripedia Even Warns Against This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If, after listening to approximately 60 shows, the How Did This Get Made podcast taught me anything, it's to appreciate Nicolas Cage. As a matter of fact, I never truly knew about his outbursts until I listened to that internet show where they ridicule bad movies for about an hour. And they seem to favor Nick Cage a lot.A movie that was completely off my radar was the 2006 thriller/remake, The Wicker Man. It was so much off my spectrum, that I probably would've never seen it had the creative How Did This Get Made crew didn't spotlight it.To get me to hate it, they did not. Contrarily, I ended up liking it more for its "So Bad, It's Good" vibe. After all, I waited patiently the whole movie for the Real Nick Cage to bust a move. And he did. He did in spades.Don't get me wrong, it's not a great or even good movie, even when it started off decent. Sorta.Copper Cage gets all bent out of shape when he somewhat helps a single mother and child who inadvertently gets killed and disappears, literally, in front of his eyes.Spoiler Alert?.Forget I even said that, as it never comes up again, or at least not to move the plot forward. Instead, focus on the note Cop Cage gets to help track down a missing girl on a mysterious island where the mother of said child resides.With some useless bargaining, he makes it to the isle of the damned actresses and he begins his search. More and more frustrated Constable Cage gets until he?wait for it?does what I went into see: a meltdown.Oh, this movie's bad, so bad, but it doesn't get that way until the second half and good news, it's worth watching the whole thing for. It's so outrageous, it's fun. I advise paying attention to all details. Not that they make sense, but it will help you laugh completely unintentionally?which is all the fun of this.If the original The Wicker Man is like this, or even ends like this one, all the surprise is gone, it's spoiled. Maybe it's better and maybe, I'll see it someday. Until then, I will enjoy great Edward "Nicolas Cage" Malus lines like: "BITCHES! YOU BITCHES!" "Is this hers? How'd it get burned? How'd it get burned? HOW'D IT GET BURNED, HOW'D IT GET BURNED?" "This is murder! Murder! You'll all be guilty, and you're doing it for nothing! Killing me won't bring back your goddamn honey!""Step away from the bike!" "You little liars. Rowan Woodward IS your classmate, isn't she? ISN'T SHE? That is HER desk! And you're the biggest liar of them all. I am warning you, you tell me another and I'll arrest you myself. That is a promise, MISS... Of course, another plant! Rose!" "Ahhh, my legs!" "OH, NO! NOT THE BEES! NOT THE BEES! AAAAAHHHHH! OH, THEY'RE IN MY EYES! MY EYES! AAAAHHHHH! AAAAAGGHHH!" * * * Final thoughts: Typically I don't even recommend "So Bad, They're Good" movies, like The Room, Birdemic: Shock and Terror or Troll 2, but, I guess I have to here and that will open the floodgates to those other three mentioned movies. Go ahead and make it a fantastic weekend with all four movies. You. Will. Laugh. Your. Arse. Off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>before i begin, i should offer some advice.this movie is better viewed without having seen the original.you will probably get more out of it that way.i saw the original 1st,which makes it hard to give a fair review of the remake.nevertheless,i will try.casting Nic Cage in the lead role was a good move.Cage is credible in his role.the whole film is populated with current and past big name actors,some of whom have small roles,and some who have larger roles.not all do convincing job.some were rather lacklustre in their roles.this 2006 version is a remake of the 1973 classic,and adds very little to its parent.there is a lot more music and noise in all the appropriate places,of course(I'm being sarcastic here).the story is pretty much the same,involving the occult and paganism.the biggest problem with this movie is it's rating.because of it's PG13 rating,it lacks the edge and risqué than the original.to be more effective,this type of movie should have a more adult rating.this is also problem with logic in this movie.there are just some things that don't make sense and there is no real attempt to explain them.the truth is,this movie is just a louder version of the original,minus the the scenes minus the edginess.as a stand alone movie,its not half bad.like i said,if you watch this movie without having seen the original,you will have a higher opinion of it.i will give "The Wicker Man" 2006 version 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful bit of retelling by campy star/director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The wonderful thing about Nicolas Cage is that he throws himself into the role, good or bad, 100%. Which is exactly what a movie like this needs of its leading man, who is on screen almost the entire film. Therefore, if you're willing to watch Cage ham it up with reckless abandon in this remake of the 70s cult thriller, then you're in for an enjoyable experience.Eerie in a way that movies now a day just aren't, The Wicker Man uses the most of all the production devices at its disposal. Sets and surroundings are surreally bizarre; the musical score is creepy and uncomfortable, and the costumes are unsettling and sometimes disturbing. It figures that a stage director like LaBute would find inspiration in all these cinematic devices, as they are equally, if not more important to the stage work world he comes from.However, without the smoke and mirrors of the production crew, the plot is rather thin and develops at a snail's pace. In true seventies fashion, the film is more character driven and unconcerned about delivering a definitive beginning, middle and end story arc that wraps up nicely. It's more about Cage's character's journey and how he deals with the situations he finds himself in.As the film progresses, the situations seem more and more bizarre, yet answers fail to come, and as an audience member it can prove to be frustrating. However, Cage's performance and LaBute's direction, propped up by a great supportive cast, compels you to watch it. The island Cage finds himself on, investigating a missing child, is just slightly unlike the rest of the world. The sense is that we're watching an Amish community based on the principles of a beehive. Burstyn's queen bee performance is every bit as powerful as her turn in Requiem for a Dream (why isn't this woman working more often?) and the supporting females are the most unlikely bunch of femme fatales yet every bit as menacing.The film plods along and requires the audience's trust, as we are often as much in the dark as Cage is. The twist ending is a slight shock, but probably not as much as it was 30 years ago. Yet it was interesting enough to give this film a slight recommendation, though i do realize it isn't for everyone's taste, especially those who like their films quick and tidy.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very feminist remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you'd hold a survey among TRUE horror fanatics exclusively and request them to put together their top ten of all times, the original 1973 version of Anthony Shaffer's "The Wicker Man" would be one title that returns at the tops constantly. It also happens to be one of the only films that the genre fans consider to be sacred and "untouchable", ...and I'm one of them. Whatever demon possessed the mind of Neil LaBute when he thought he could improve this genuine horror masterpiece is anyone's guess, but he did it anyway. And we could all hate him for it, or we might take a moment to sit down and actually watch it with an open mind. Okay, it's still bad and redundant...but at least it's not entirely hopeless. I don't care what anyone says, a film that stars Nicolas Cage, Ellen Burstyn and Leelee Sobieski is always worth a look. And, believe it or not, but some of the minor script modifications LaBute introduced are actually making sense and even add logic to the original concept. I suppose everyone already knows that "The Wicker Man" revolves on a lonely police sergeant traveling to the remote island community of Summersisle to investigate the disappearance of a young girl. Naturally in this remake it's an American community instead of a British one and LaBute also added an actual connection between sergeant Edward Malus and one of the island's female inhabitants. He was formerly engaged to 'sister' Willow, but she mysteriously vanished until now she's asking him for help finding her daughter Rowan. A minor flaw in the 1973 original was how they never really explained why sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) was the chosen one for the island's rites of sacrifice. Another bizarre difference between this remake and the original version is the extreme emphasis on feminism! 'Lord' Summersisle (one of the most memorable roles of horror-deity Christopher Lee) is replaced by Sister Summerisle (Ellen Burstyn) and the entire island is reigned by women. The men on Summersisle are barely able to speak, only girls enjoy the right to education (where they learn how men are merely just walking phallus symbols...) and none of the men are present during the essential harvest celebrations. The rest of the film is pretty much identical to the original. Edward Malus encounters strangely behaving &amp; truly unhelpful people in his search for little Rowan, only in this version the island and its curious inhabitants are a lot less menacing and their fertility rituals are a whole lot less imaginative. Unquestionably the biggest omission in this remake is the original's fascinating music! Apart from a compelling mystery-thriller and a unique folklore horror-tale, Anthony Shaffer's "The Wicker Man" also is a brilliant musical! Moments like the Maypole-dance and especially Britt Ekland's siren song contributed in making it an extraordinary experience, but Neil LaBute deliberately ignored all the musical greatness of the original and replaced it with dull sub plots, like for example Nicolas Cage suffering from reoccurring nightmares about the victims of a car crash he couldn't save. The climax sequence ? which shouldn't be a secret to anyone anymore ? is competently elaborated and the epilogue is quite entertaining, too. Like the case with "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "The Wicker Man" surely didn't require a nowadays hi-tech remake, but still the result could have been worse. Younger audiences who never heard of the story and refuse to watch movie made prior to 1990 will think it's a brilliant film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nick Cage fans might like it - otherwise save your time and money and pass on it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick Cage stars in this remake of the original of the same name. If you have seen the original then you know what to expect. Cage is your average everyday Joe who is a cop. Due to a on the job occurrence he goes on leave of his job as a cop and takes medication for depression. This "occurance" haunts him throughout the movie and is relived again and again through nightmares and "daydreams". This may be confusing to some viewers. Along the way he is asked to come to an isolated island to search for his ex fiancé's daughter. The people and events he sees on this island are very strange, and he sees just how strange as the movie progresses to a shocking and unexpected finale (again, for those that have not seen the original). This movie can't really be called a horror flick because it actually doesn't cross into very gory horror territory although death and blood are viewed in certain parts of the film. It is rather disturbing at parts though and it ends up giving a very disappointing and disturbing ending to a movie that has you thinking that the good old Hollywood happy ending would win out in the end as it does in most films. If you love feel good happy endings, then this movie is NOT for you. Nick Cage was great, as would be expected of an Academy Award winner but the rest of the cast all had small parts that all combined to present the feeling of this big community, but separately the acting really was average for the rest of the cast. The replay value is very low on this film. This is not a movie that you will want to watch over and over. In fact, once will most certainly be enough for you. Not one of the greatest movies I have seen, and it is certainly one of Nick Cage's most dismal and dark films. A score of 4 for the acting of Cage. Without him this movie would have been a complete waste, with him it is only a partial waste of time and money. If you do not like Cage then this is a movie you will probably want to pass on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointment....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i saw this movie, I have to say it was somewhat intriguing. The plot was nicely done, (yes i realize its a remake) comparing to other horror films. I just have to say that this movie simply wasn't scary, other than some rather annoying parts that just made loud noises to make you jump out of your seat. The end is quite disturbing, also, but at the same time left a scary touch. Having said that, ill be blunt here. This movie is just plain garbage. The only reason i liked it is because i laughed so hard! There are so many parts that are just random and unnecessary, yet funny! I'm not sure if this is good or bad, but i really don't think the writers intended this, so I'm guessing thats bad. For example, Nicholas Cage beats up 2 old ladys and kicks the crap out of a younger lady, which does not look good for him, although funny. He has about 5 random flashbacks where the girl gets hit by the semi AGAIN, (dont worry that happens in the beginning, and was even in the preview) and points a gun at a school teacher for her bike... I think I've said enough. Made me laugh a lot, so it wasn't too bad but if your looking for scary, just watch the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would love to be more positive but found this to be tedious in spite of some good performances. Ellen Burstyn was wonderful as always. Nicolas Cage was likable and quite good in spite of the fact that I'm not a fan. The actress who portrayed Willow was visually distracting- she has such strong features that all I could do was stare at her lips anytime she was on screen- and not in a good way. She was also weak as an actress in my opinion. Her overall presence detracted from the film.They did succeed in building a subtly creepy mood and the film was visually interesting. I would have enjoyed a little more fleshing out of the characters, the island history, the few males present and their reason for being permitted, etc...Overall, this film fell short of my expectations (which weren't high to begin with) and could have been so much more interesting, but instead just felt badly paced and a an inferior remake overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Detailed Analysis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Wicker Man is one of my favorite films, but I was very open to the remake, and I assure you that my opinion is unbiased.In the remake, it seemed like they struggled to formulate a new plot, with many convoluted subplots that truly ruin the integrity of the film. It felt like a movie at all times. You are never so wrapped up in the story that you forget, unlike the original version. The original has an unbeatable authenticity that isn't found here.Another huge problem with this film is that it tried to incorporate elements from the original that either led nowhere or just made no sense. For instance, the failure of the crops is significant in both films, but in this film they aren't crops - in any manner of speaking. Also, the natives practiced the same festival in the remake, but it isn't explained nearly as well, it is passed off as "just some festival". One thing the remake did a terrible job at is foreshadowing. I knew how the film ended, and when I saw the original, I had no idea, but as I watched the remake I noticed little hints throughout the film - most were blatantly obvious. It does a terrible job of leaving the audience in tension, and it doesn't let us figure anything out for ourselves. I hate that.A final issue I had with the film was the ending. I found the original to be much more emotional and shocking. The ending to this film tried to be more shocking and falls flat on it's face. In fact, I like the movie much less because of the new twist at the end. All in all, the original is superior in every way. See the remake to satisfy your curiosity, but for no other reason.*Also, the 4 people I saw the film with have not seen the original, and they thought it was "just okay". Take my word for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read this book at least 15 years ago. Since the book itself is rather slow it is no surprise that this movie is too. I never saw the original movie but I will just to be able to compare. Nicholas Cage is, as always, a great actor. In some ways it is worth it just to see another one of his wonderful performances. I also really enjoyed the performance of Ellen Burstyn. There are a lot of ambiguous comments by the players in this movie to intrigue but they are never really explained either by the action or by words. The premise is good; it just doesn't ever seem to really take off. It is the kind of movie that, although it is too slow to really take you away, you stick with just to see how it comes out. The ending is a surprise with a bit of a twist so it is worth it to stick with it to see how it comes out.</fullReview>

If we take the fact away that it was a remake of a classic and stood it in the light apart from the original then it's certainly not total crap. it's average border lining on OK. The story is OK it holds your attention it's never going to win any awards, but maybe some of the younger readers who haven't seen the original might like it. There are far worse films even remakes which this Wicker Man is better than. Overall nothing too thrilling but a mediocre film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Parody-Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I watched the original "The Wicker Man" the night before, in preparation for the Cage version. And in watching the new one I am left with the impression that the filmmakers wanted to make a parody, but, parodies of 30+ year old movies having as they do, rather limited audiences, they masqueraded it as a remake, to get it produced.The end result is somewhere in between a parody and a remake, and it's pretty weird. The audience for this film is probably even tinier ? those expecting a remake will be disappointed by a slew weird changes from the original film, and those who haven't seen the original will probably find it to be an incoherent mess. But with the original fresh in mind and having no especial fondness for it, I found the remake highly entertaining. And as a vehicle for Cage to do what he does best, that is, go a little bit crazy, this film is ideal.Take for example a scene early in the film where Cage visits a school classroom. The scene is ripped directly from the original film, but exaggerated and made funny. "Phallic symbol, phallic symbol" chant the children, as if quoting the original film, and stripping it of context and meaning. Then there's the crow in the desk. And then there's Cage's dramatic point at the empty desk. All of these moments are funny if you remember the original. The teacher's slip of the tongue in this scene is particularly funny, because you realize that she's just revealed something the film wasn't supposed to reveal yet ? but the dramatic tension isn't lost because having seen the original you already knew what was going to happen.From there it gets worse if you've not seen the original. The whole pagan thing is never actually explained and instead there's this weird women vs. men thing going on. On reflection I have no idea what the point of the beginning was. Other important details that made the narrative of the original cohesive are brushed over. And there's an added twist to the original twist ending that obviously doesn't make sense. Good film.</fullReview>

Every scene and dialog is over-the-top to the extreme and Nicolas Cage is clearly the perfect cast, big key chunks of the original story are missing and it comes as poorly stitched together reenactment, with very low production value, but then again - if you'll view it as a parody everything suddenly begins to make sense.

The reason its a good film is because it has a good script, good acting and a daringly original plot. The remake, unfortunately, lacks all of these things strongly. The only similarities with the original is the name of the island. Thats it. Even if it wasn't dubbed as a remake it would still be a horrible individual film. All the rest of the film is, is juts feeding us the same old crap we've been watching from Hollywood over the past five years. Its filled with cheap special effects, and jump scenes to make sure the audience stays awake. The acting is cringe worthy, and half the time the local townspeople look embarrassed to be in such a bad film, and I have to say I don't blame them.

		<fullReview>I hate this movie. It's a good thing I got in free because I would have demanded my money back if I had payed. This movie had a horrible unengaged plot line. I watched it expecting a sort of freaky movie. But a movie about a bunch of delusional femenists? What the hell? That has got to be the worst idea since Snakes on a Plane. The girl was a part of the whole plot (that little bitch) and it wasn't even important. The part that just made me laugh was to find out that they are sacrificing a man to save there honey. Like I said, they are all crazy. Nicholas Cage must have been desperate to act to play in this movie. This movie doesn't even stand up to what Nicholas Cage is worth. No one should see this movie. It is a waste of money. I will not watch this movie again. This has got to be the worst waste of time in my life since I watched "The Descent." To be honest the only good horror movie I have seen all summer is "The Omen." Worst waste of time ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay; Who Is Mad At Nicolas Cage?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so horribly bad that, if I were Nicolas Cage, or ANYONE affiliated with it, I would DEMAND that my publicist make no reference to it at all in any materials published about me. Nicolas Cage looks dreadful in this movie. It is as if he threw a tantrum and angered some Hollywood power brokers who repaid him by forcing him to star in this huge joke of a movie. The writing is awful. There is no logical reason for Cage's character to be as overbearing and arrogant as he is to the people on Summersisle, a place to which he has never been, and the customs of which he has no knowledge. Also, why would he go to this island on such a wild goose chase? The characters on Summersisle are odd (and bad actors to boot), but Cage's character has no right to be so boorish while he is there. There are several apparently important loose ends that are never tied up, which only added to my frustration about this waste of time and celluloid. What about the twins on the island, for example? Why was a big deal made about them and no resolution given? Who were the mother and daughter at the beginning of the movie?My daughter and I laughed through most of THE WICKER MAN. She was treating me to an afternoon at the movies, and I told her I would give her her money back. Still, we did laugh until our stomachs ached, so that counts for something: we now know for sure that our tastes in movies are nearly identical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad to Great Until the Bitter End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, while the top review did pretty much summarize my feelings about this movie, I had a few problems with it; yes, you could see the end coming about 20 miles off (about the distance of cell phone coverage in this movie, apparently).I also love Nicholas Cage, and it clearly looked as if he was tired of the film about halfway through. The script did something that I think no director likes to be forced to do, which is to promise more than it delivers. You have a distinct feeling that something more is going on, something else is happening ? la The Ring, etc, but in the end, he just plain dies. No twist, no nothing. Up until this point, there's been an undercurrent of whispery noises and just few enough references to this mysterious "Wicker Man" that you're interested enough not to walk out of the darn thing despite Mr. Cage's obvious ennui and the weird lighting (many of the night scenes' lighting setups were so yellow, they looked just like daylight streaming in through the windows/leaves, and the midnight forest was backlit as if by floodlights--all in the middle of an organic hippie commune).Also, you find it hard to believe that these women could continue their plot, year after year, and get away with it, no-one noticing the disappearance of any male who goes there or meets anyone from that place, oh well... Cage's character did tell his friend he was thinking about going there, and on his cell phone which worked twice in the movie--oddly enough, miles away from the mainland shore--he yelled "help me!!", and cell phone usage location records are traceable by the police in a disappearance investigation.Anyway, I could have put up with all of that, if there had just been a bit more to deliver at the end. End of story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you enjoyed the previews for this film, go no further. This happens to be one of those instances were the trailer is grossly misleading. My friend and I went to the theater totally prepared for a sort of "8mm" meets the supernatural universe, but the only remotely supernatural things that happen in this movie are merely dream sequences. Plot devices are weak, several of them serving little or no purpose to conflict progression or resolution, and all "horror" scenes are simply gimmicks to make the audience jump (not to mention badly telescoped with overabundant "scary music"); none is a serious threat to the character and all are easily resolved. Without spoiling the ending, I will say only that it is thoroughly unsatisfying. A film that does not live up to its marketing campaign or Nick Cage's better performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original Rules</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wonder why this remake was necessary? Edward Woodward was vastly superior to Nicholas Cage. Why was it vital to change the antagonist role from a man, Christopher Lee, to a woman, Ellen Burstyn? This film was a doctrine of the Women's Lib Movement, instead of a religious philosophical film which was the original. Very few other plot lines were different from the original. I hope people get a renewed interest in the original and see it. The change of setting did not help either. I realize there are cults in the United States, but the original Scotish setting was more sinister. How come they police wouldn't look for Cage when he did not return? At least two of his colleagues knew of his plans and destination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read some of the other review titles and honestly I couldn't disagree more I thought it was an amazing remake of a sadistic tale and it was brought back to life by the talents of Nicolas Cage. Although I thought it could have been explained about a bit better, maybe with Edward reading a diary in the background but otherwise it was truly tremendous acting from all in this. Also some of the smaller things in it weren't thought out as well for instance; When Edward was stuck in the water hole at the old church he manged to hold on to the metal cover for over eight or more hours which is physically impossible as far as i'm aware. Well worth a watch. A sadistic classic brought back to work by the great acting of Nicolas Cage</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wicker Man starts as traumatised Californian cop Edward Malus (Nicholas Cage) is at home recovering from failing to save a mother &amp; daughter in a car accident when he receives a letter from his ex-girlfriend Willow Woodward (Kate Beahan), living on a small island called Summersisle Willow claims that her daughter Rowan has gone missing &amp; she needs his help to find her. Travelling to the privately owned Summersisle Edward finds a community of women who consider men inferior &amp; worship nature, Willow informs Edward not to believe anything he sees or hears. Edward investigates Rowan's disappearance &amp; while at first the community denies all knowledge of her Edward discovers that Rowan has not only gone missing but may have been murdered in a religious sacrifice &amp; the sinister locals are not telling him everything...This American, German &amp; Canadian co-production was written &amp; directed by Neil LaBute &amp; is a remake of the classic horror film The Wicker Man (1973) which itself was based on the novel Ritual, considered by many including myself as a bit of a genre great this remake had a lot to live up to. Available in both 'R' &amp; 'Unrated' versions (the Unrated one has a few more violent shots in it &amp; removes the 'Six Months Later' epilogue) &amp; I will be basing my comment on the Unrated cut. While this remake follows the original fairly closely in terms of major events like the receiving of the letter, a search for a missing girl, the harvest photos, an empty grave, an isolated island &amp; of course the twist ending this remake does change some of the details which hurt it &amp; change the entire tone of the film. For instance the revelation that Rowan is Edward's daughter is unnecessary &amp; his links to the island are unneeded, the Celtic Pagan worshippers of the original have been replaced by a feminist Mother Earth society which is just hard to take seriously &amp; have no real menace about them, the lord of the island is now a woman as are all the main character's on the island which just feels odd, the local pub with all the regulars have been replaced with what looks like a trendy hotel &amp; for some reason there's constant flashbacks to an opening sequence where Edward fails to save a mother &amp; daughter in a fire which seems to have nothing to do with anything else. While the original didn't go for shocks or cheap scares this one does, no-one was actually killed in the original except at the end but here the pilot is &amp; silly scenes where Edward is chased by Bees &amp; dreams where he has to save Rowan from drowning feel like they were added for the novelty value. Some of the dialogue is hilarious, the 'not the Bees! Not the Bees!' is great, a scene when Edward loses it &amp; pulls a gun out on Sister Rose &amp; 'get away from the bike!' is funny as is the bit when he wakes up from a nightmare. Having said that The Wicker Man tells a story, it's something different &amp; I can't believe all the comments that state it makes no sense &amp; has no story. Do people actually watch &amp; listen to films properly anymore? If there isn't a shoot-out or a CGI special effect every two minutes people just seem to have a hard time concentrating, The Wicker Man does make sense &amp; does have a decent story it's just that a few of the ill advised creative decisions &amp; tinkering ruin it.The original was set on a remote Scottish island while here the entire story is shifted to the states &amp; an island not far from Washington, the island looks too pleasant really with birds chirping, the sun shining &amp; quaint little cottages littered about everywhere in a Little House on the Prairie idyllic sort of way. The violence is tame, apparently originally given an 'R' in the US a lot of cuts were made for a 'PG' &amp; while the final scenes of Edward having his legs broken &amp; injected have been replaced there was still four minutes worth left out. The Pagan versus Christianity of the original worked far better than the female supremacy themes here, instead of being threatening &amp; creepy they come across as silly old women.With a supposed budget of about $40,000,000 this had some money spent on it &amp; it looks nice enough to an extent but it looks too staged &amp; too nice as it were. Filmed mainly in British Columbia in Canada. Cage overacts badly in this, some of his delivery is just funny when it should be intense. Ellen Burstyn gets the Christopher Lee role here but has little impact while Molly Parker as Sister Rose/Thorn is quite hot actually. The first name of Cage's character is Edward while the last name of Beahan's is Woodward which is a cheeky reference to the star of the original Edward Woodward.The Wicker Man is nowhere near as good as the original but I'll bet most on here who are slating it haven't even seen the original, to be honest I didn't think it was as bad as some make out but that's just me I suppose. A few really bad decisions kill it really otherwise it's not to dissimilar to the original everyone seems to love so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Change</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just start by saying that I've never seen the original movie. Good, OK that's out of the way. I liked this movie because it didn't have your normal "conflict against a religious cult ending". Cage was tricked fair and square. No two ways about it. Normally, Cage would have found some way out of his predicament with the cultists, and gotten away from the island or back-up would have arrived at the last second...But NO! He ended up being the sucker to a devious and secretive cult's plan for sacrifice. But come on, at least he didn't freaking imagine the whole thing or some other clichéd ending like we've seen from recent suspense/horror/mystery flicks. As stated before I realize that this movie is a remake. I think I speak for a lot of movie fans when I say "ENOUGH WITH THE DANG REMAKES ALREADY!" but this one I actually liked. Perhaps it was because the bad guys won in the end. I don't know. It was suspenseful and I'm sure all of us were glad to see cage knock the crap out of a few deranged cultists like he should have done from the start. Alright it wasn't the best movie but it deserved higher that a 3.3 for crying out loud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very eerie, creepy, dreamy story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film last weekend as part of a triple feature at my local drive-in. I did not pay attention to the TV commercials and I am so glad. Not having read any reviews or even knowing what it was about was an advantage for me. The only thing I knew about WickerMan was that it was a thriller with Nicholas Cage. Since I like most of his movies I gave it a try. My mind (for this movie) was a clean slate and really soaked up the eerie world of Summersisle. I enjoy Cage's acting and certainly felt for the plight of his character. IMO, the acting highlight of Wickerman was Leelee Sobieski. I hadn't even heard of her before seeing the credits for this film. Her performance stood out and commanded my attention whenever she was on the screen. I'll certainly be looking for her work in the future.If the point of the story is to creep you out and cover you with an eerie and disturbing mood- then it worked on me! The entire presentation gave me a bad dream kind of feeling. The entire film held my attention from the opening scene to the epilogue. IMO it is a very well told story. I don't know if this version tops the original but it is certainly on top of my 'creepy movie' list. If you like weird, scary, creepy tales- this one is for you.</fullReview>

Viewers might even wonder if any of the actors or actresses were given a script. All Willow does is fumble around for words. Leelee Sobieski is just as bad...despite all the hope I had for her. Every part of this film is either laughable or just plain awkward...never suspenseful, never engaging, and NEVER scary.They missed the mark big time on this one.Please trust me.

		<fullReview>I saw the original the day before I saw the re-make. I thought that nothing could be worse than a woman dancing around her room naked, effeminate bartenders and horrible music, but I was wrong. I realized I was wrong once Nicholas Cage started punching random women in the face and screaming, over a very bad over dub, "Ah, ouch, oh, you broke my leg!" It was deplorable! For one thing they totally changed 80% of the original plot line. The lunatic that they had play Rowan's mother was just an excuse to have a minor romantic influence to the horrible recipe that was the movie. Nicholas Cage's voice just doesn't do for the part. He's so breathy and dry that it was difficult to listen to the whole thing. The whole movie went no where, and it only got worse and more frustrating at the whole thing played out. No, I won't say "play", because play suggests organization. I'll say, spewed out. Because that's exactly what it was, vomit. Then the whole thing is dedicated to Johnny Ramone. Apparently Nick was really good friends with Ramone and thought that his dead friend, a legendary punk rocker, deserved this horrible movie in his name. Poor Johnny. I can't even organize any kind of reasonable article for this load of junk. Let me just say, see the original, maybe, and then don't see the re-make. DON'T see the re-make. I wish I could go on a pilgrimage across the US and Germany telling people not to see this excuse for cinema. Thank you, Neil LaBute for robbing me of my seven dollars and hour and a half of my life that could have, and I would have even preferred to have had been giving birth to a small calf. A small calf that would be more interesting and less painful than watching that pile of ranky stanky vomit.</fullReview>

While there, he encounters endless frustration as the inhabitants of the island resent his presence and lie to him repeatedly.This movie is so bad that it occasionally warrants laughter. The plot is a cross between Hostel and The Village, but it is not as entertaining. At no time are the characters believable or interesting. The opening scene has no relevance to the plot at all. The movie subjects the viewer to pointless flashbacks of the opening scene with slight variations. The only action this movie has is Nicholas Cage getting into an occasional fight with women. These fights are not intended to be amusing, but one fight is so poorly choreographed it's hard not to laugh.The most annoying part of the movie is watching a policeman disregard all due process and legal jurisdiction. In the story's attempt to make Nicholas Cage appear as a ruthless investigator, they only succeed in making him look stupid. This movie is so bad, it's not even worth renting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, let's remake the greatest British Horror film of its generation and make it so bad that you'd wish it was you in the Wicker Man.The movie was terrible. Where the original was held together by the music and the pagan rituals, the remake had nothing to bring the separate pieces together.Cage's acting lacked the naivety that the role demanded. The cop needed to be an innocent, a fool, not just someone who came to the island of his own free will.The last ten minutes were the best and echoed the original. But that's what the movie needed throughout its entire length. We needed to see more of what held the island together, what kept the women in charge and why the men were subservient.Cage's character was Cameron Poe on Prozac. Thank God for Ellen Burstyn! If you haven't had the pleasure of watching the 70's classic version, watch this first then rent the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm fed up of reading comments from people that start 'i left this movie half way through.' If that's true, then you didn't watch the movie properly and your opinion is pretty much useless.Going to see this film as a huge fan of the original, I found it in turn original, disappointing, frustrating, clever and sweetly respectful of its source material. Quite a mixed collection of feelings.There were enough deviations from the original to make it a valid film in its own right, so I'll completely avoid the ultimately pointless 'why do Hollywood keep doing remakes' argument. There is nothing new under the sun. However, what was a little disappointing:1) as a film that could make the most of unsettling its audience by focusing on bizarre and unusual pagan rituals and beliefs, it relied too much on bog-standard 'Cage is trapped underwater', 'Cage is falling through loose flooring' action/jump scenes. 2) all elements of the belief/faith and the erotic, and therefore the crucial links between sex, temptation, testing and purity are overshadowed by a fairly shallow feminist pretence. Sex and sexiness are replaced by the red herring of sexual politics. Duff move, especially with such beautiful leading ladies. 3) The wonderful folk soundtrack of the original (which added to its creepy earthiness and ancient tradition) has been replaced by a fairly lacklustre orchestral score, with oddly pointless whispering. While I didn't expect the same songs, here was potential for something far more daring. 4) Nobody, man or woman, was ever going to do a better job of the Lord Summerisle/Lady Summersisle role than Christopher Lee.Things that were good about it? Well, it may be a remake, but it's not a plot that's been done often, so there's still a sense of surprise, fear and originality to it. I would certainly class it as a thriller rather than a horror, so i guess the lack of tension is slightly disappointing. However, there's loads of recreated shots and subtle in-jokes that will tickle fans of the original. Even more satisfying in some ways are the references to Nic Roeg's 'Don't Look Now' (the original Wicker Man played as the B-Movie to 'DLN' in the UK.) So, cue blind old ladies(with implied psychic powers), red coats, lost little girls running in the shadows etc.Ultimately, enough has been changed to make this film worth watching in its own right. The script is patchy, but Cage is not half as bad as some say - in fact at points, he is excellent). It honours the original's startling climax (although dumbs it down rather by setting up for a sequel) and while it won't ever be regarded as a classic, it will hopefully enable a new generation to discover the horror and comedy and beauty of the true original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I thought to myself that I would give this film a try. I am a big fan of the original but I do feel that it's age shows a little and a re-vamp might work.After seeing the film I can now see how silly I was. To say this film is bad is to give it credit. If i did anything as poor as this in my job I would be sacked without a second thought. This is now just another in a long line of horror remakes that has been messed up by Hollywood.Nicholas Cage is not one of my favourite actors and in my opinion has never done any better than Leaving Las Vegas, but here he shows a whole new level of wooden and pathetic. Two major points I noticed was the need to pull his gun to steal a bike of a tiny woman and when he tried to wake the pilot awake after finding him with his eyes and mouth stitched together. surely the blood and the pale complexion was a bit of a give away.The procession at the end just made me want to laugh. In the original the cast merrily danced their way to the sacrifice spot. Here they kind of bumble along occasionally flapping their arms and swaying a bit. These people are trying to restore their gods favour and get a bumper crop, they look more like a bunch of eight year olds being forced back to school after their summer holidays.At the end in a rather pathetic whine Nickolas Cage asks his former fiancé "Willow, Why have you done this to me?". The previous hour and twenty of the film has already answered that for you. His character is probably the most dull and boring ever.People may now ask me after making all these comments why have I given the film a 3 and not lower? The answer to that is simple. Not only was I pleased that the original ending was kept in the film, I was glad to see him burn. Any sympathy felt for Edward Woodward in the original is completely lost here. My only regret is that the burning didn't take longer, I have wasted an hour and a half of my life watching this rubbish. The least they could have done is made him suffer in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pagan-bashing tripe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, a commendation. The cinematography and location shots on the island are beautifully done. The costuming, likewise.Now the criticisms. Cage's character is totally unrealistic. Highway patrol officers simply do not investigate child abductions on their own, especially across state borders. And no one seems to be concerned by the end of the film that he's missing... Cage's acting is stilted with lines seemingly cobbed from a MAD TV takeoff of "Cops!" I don't think it was intended to be a comedy, was it? Perhaps it was Cage's total embarrassment for having accepted the role without reading the script. At least Burstyn developed her character well, as I would have expected.Unfortunately the film has a much worse flaw. It is religious bigotry disguised as a horror tale. It unforgivably perpetuates a centuries-old blood libel against Pagan Witches. Many of the characters are clearly identified as such with references to their Celtic religious roots, their negative experiences in Salem, and their Goddess-centered worship of nature. The libel that Witches murder unborn children and seduce witless men into being sacrificed in their unholy rites is one straight out of the Dark Ages and the Holy Inquisition. There is no credible evidence that the events at the end of the film ever were practiced by Celtic Pagans with a living person. Sadly, it is on historical record that was a common event with another well-known religious body. The bigotry can not be more blatant. Not worth watching. Ask for your money back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Director Neil LaBute recreates the 1973 cult film of the same name. That last sentence will be the last time I ever mention Mr. LaBute's name without warning someone to NEVER see another of his films. This is, without a doubt, one of the worst made films I have seen in YEARS! Trying to capture the camp of the cheesy flicks from the 70's that usually starred David Soul and/or Roddy McDowell, this captures nothing but boredom and stupidity. Bad sets, shoddy photography, a joke of a script and apparently no rehearsals deliver exactly what one would expect ... an embarrassment for all involved.Let's talk Nicolas Cage for a moment. I am certain he was being fed his lines just as the camera began to roll. He sleepwalks through this "performance" and I assume agreed to this as some last minute favor for a friend ... or possibly for easy money. By far his worst performance ever!! The rest of the cast is almost as bad as Cage. The usually great Ellen Burstyn can't possibly be this desperate for work. Leelee Sobieski, who showed such promise in "Joy Ride" and "Glass House" and then took two years off, acts like she has never been in front of a camera before. Three confusing near-cameos are provided by Aaron Eckhart, James Franco and Jason Ritter.There is no redeeming value in this one. It is not even FUN BAD. It is quite simply BAD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid, woman-hating, and suspenseless...but I enjoyed it more than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't like the first "Wicker Man" for several reasons: (1) no mystery: the ending was predictable almost from the outset; (2) no ending: the last act should have resolved the religious conflict that lay at the heart of the story, and it didn't, it was essentially irrelevant; (3) no style: everyone all too clearly thought they were doing something good and serious, but the film couldn't escape looking like a cheap horror movie of the period: a Tigon film with delusions of grandeur; (4) fake folk music: however much research went into it, it sounded like an undergraduate project for music class. In this remake, the music is standard suspense movie music, and so it doesn't annoy; the talk is never serious, and so it doesn't pretend; there is no religious conflict to resolve, and so it doesn't distract; the ending isn't predictable (if you haven't seen the first movie), and so it doesn't hang fire; for all these reasons I enjoyed watching this movie, most of the way through, more than the first; until the pleasure faire at the end, when it turns obviously silly, it plays like "Harvest Home" or some other typical TV movie that holds the interest minimally; never more, but never less. However, this one is unusually stupid, unusually misogynistic, and--for a would-be suspense movie--unusually short on suspense. The ending is unforeseeable, everything is unforeseeable, because the characters' preceding behavior doesn't naturally lead up to it, or to anything; it's illogical and ill motivated all the way through, and so anything might happen, at any time. But unlike the first movie, this one didn't get my goat (or should I say, put a bee in my bonnet?); and I liked two things about it--the photography of the island, and the performance by the schoolteacher--which is more than I can say for some of the other thirty-year-old thrillers now undergoing cosmetic reconstruction (cf. "The Omen" and "The Amityville Horror").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a guilty secret. I love to watch scary and gory horror movies all by myself with a bowl of popcorn and a pillow to hide behind when I am too frightened. If the movie turns out to be more ridiculous and ludicrous than scary, I am very disappointed and yell wise cracks at the actors. That is what happened during my viewing of the 2006 "The Wicker Man". Me, yelling at Nicholas Cage; "Are you daft? Get out of the freaking island, it's a loony bin!!" He didn't listen to me and frankly I was happy when he dies at the end. When you are that stupid, bad things should happen to you. The 1973 version left you with a powerful feeling of unease, fear and disgust. In the new one, the inhabitants of the island remind me a bit of certain people you see in health food stores, dressed like the hippies never went away, and always babbling about the earth and organic crops. They are supposed to be pagans, but the only deviant sexual behavior you see is Leelee Sobieski acting like a horny, annoying teenage girl whom you want to slap. At the end, the tortures inflicted on Nicholas Cage, are right out of Steven King's "Misery". Couldn't they invent their own? All in all, a waste of film and time.</fullReview>

I liked it, right up to that pitiful excuse for an ending. I never saw the original film, but I understand it follows it, but I don't get having such a richly developed character, as Nicholas Cages was, that is honest, and only doing what is truly right, I actually really LIKED the character, only to have it killed at the end, no climatic escape/rescue/or even some form of later vengeance. It completely killed it for me, had he made it, or had gotten some form of vengeance after the fact, I would have said this was one of the best movies I had ever seen. This was a production by a major film company, with big names, and a budget, I hate seeing such an "indy" ending to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another remake. This one is a remake of a 1976 film that is, according to the rating it got on the IMDb, rather good. I've never seen it, so I can't comment on that.Anyway. In this film Nicolas Cage plays a pained cop that gets a letter from a woman he almost married. She tells him her daughter is missing and asks him to find her. He sets out to find the girl and ends up on a private island where he encounters a strange community existing almost solely of women.It is within that community that he must now find his daughter. And it is within this community that he finds things are not what they look like and that they are actually a lot worse.Again, I have never seen the original film, but I am interested in seeing that now. This remake is a worthless one, but the idea is nice enough. This remake is worthless because it has some severe plot holes. For the rest it isn't all bad, but I wouldn't suggest anyone to watch this.3 out of 10 failed pagan rituals</fullReview>

I consider Mel Gibson's "Passion" to be a 1/10 (or lower) and any senseless gory horror movie a 2/10 (think Saw II).My props to Nick Cage for taking on a role that could potentially end his career. But I doubt enough people will see this movie to care anyways. He luckily redeemed himself with an excellent role in the 9/11 movie, which was released around the same time.I still recommend seeing this, but only out of morbid curiosity.</fullReview>

As well as the names changing! Rowan morrisons name to Rowan Woodward????? originally Edwards second name! The attempting Hollywood mix of genres that try to come across in the film makes it ridiculous and more corny than anything else. With its pathetic attempts to frighten and to thrill it makes you more curious as to why somebody even bothered to write,produce and make this remake. The main themes of the original film, Paganism and conflict of religion with Edwards strict Christian lifestyle isn't even explored in this remake. I think Hollywood better start coming up with some original stories instead of stealing everybody Else's and making a horrendous job of it.Quite frankly this money could have been put to better use and i could have made a better remake myself with two pieces of plasticine and a few twigs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the advertisements for the remake of "The Wicker Man" I was very excited about seeing this movie especially with the involvement of "A" list talent. I remember finding this gem of a horror movie in my local video store sometime in the early 80's and being very impressed by it. My only complaint was the folk music soundtrack that took away some of the suspense but the plotting took me completely by surprise with the nature of the true sacrifice.Updating the story to a "Amazon Pagan Colony" is obviously in hindsight not necessary. I can only imagine in screenplay form this seemed to be a good idea that fell flat on its face on screen.I find it hard to judge a remake when I know and love the original but there was just no "atmosphere" in this weird tale. To the filmmakers thanks for trying, but it just doesn't improve or update the original.</fullReview>

I don't even know if the movie was bad because of him, but he sure contributed to it. The movie was an hour and a half of garbage, and it really had no point to it. It took me about the first hour and fifteen minutes to even get a jist of what was going on in the movie. If you want to see this movie, i strongly recommend seeing the 1973 version, as i am sure it is much better than the 2006 version. Generally original versions of movies are much better than the remakes, such as the omen, Halloween, and psycho. If you want to see this movie or a movie like it, i would recommend seeing the ring and the village. If you see both of these movies, you will get the full effect of the Wicker Man except 100x better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The wicker man remake had great potential of being a good movie, however, it fails...miserably. The entire movie is a waste of time, because from the minute Cage sets foot on the island, the islanders could have locked him up and waited for the time to start the ritual. There is no reason for him to spend days searching for his child that is actually not missing. It is just cruel, to both the character AND the viewers. I could not believe i sat through an hour and a half just to see him burn with no real reason. Other viewers of the remake have also brought up the point that they are a bee colony, and it looked as though they had many bees and much honey, there seemed to be no real reason to sacrifice Cage's character. Unlike the original which dealt with growing fruits on an island in/near Scotland, which would require some help from a ritual sacrifice.All in all, i felt the acting in the movie was good, the story line was solid...until the ending. Then when you are introduced to the insanity and craziness that is the plot, the movie drops to nothing special. if you MUST see this, wait for video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Wicker man had some great things going. It occurred during the hippie revolution and an isolated religious cult, pagan worship, nude woman performing rites, etc. While the investigating police officer was a devoutly Christian religious. It was a clash of Pagan versus Christianity. The new Wicker man, in order to please the general audiences, virtually eliminated all Pagan worship so as not to offend the Christian viewers. At the same time removed the devoutly Christian Sargent so as not to offend the non-Christian viewers. Completely eliminated nudity, so as not to offend the young viewers. Turned the male symbols into somewhat a Freudian joke, instead of Pagan beliefs. Because so many fun elements of witchcraft, sorcery, Pagan worship, secret worship, nudity were all removed, the fun elements were virtually replaced with Giant Beehives, irritating bees, and a black crow that had no meaning to the movie. In this movie, all elements of horror, thrills, suspense were eliminated to be replaced with National Treasure meets the Wicker Man. To make for fun scene, ala National treasure, they let Nicolas Cage fall down in a giant cave like farm, much like that Aztec like cave, but only without the treasure. As to the running and blockbuster sequences, they added a truck hitting the car with the mother in the beginning of the scene, that had no relation to the movie, and the all too exciting bees chase Nicolas Cage. It would have been more exciting to see bees chasing Mr. Bean then Nicolas Cage, since he's more clumsier than Mr. Bean. To me it was a funny disappointing film. The original Wicker Man is in nowhere have a resemblance to this Wicker man at all, despite the fact that 80% of the scripts are the same, the first had horror overtones, while this one had unintended joke overtones. They simply completely ruined this.</fullReview>

From Nic The Dog-Faced Boy gormlessly assaying a role that was meant to personify sexual repression and is here rewritten to signify nothing much at all, and a sadly-desperate-to-work Ellen Burstyn playing the Christopher Lee role with her face painted blue, to the very idea of trying to Americanize a story that is entirely dependent on Celtic paganism to have any meaning whatsoever, this is a Cook's Tour of Hollywood inanity. The crowning "achievement," of course, is the idea that this material would find its best reinterpretation at the hands of director Neil LaBute, a man best known for biting, dark, and arguably misanthropic satires like "Your Friends and Neighbors" and "In The Company of Men." LaBute takes a thoughtful meditation on how the reactionary forces of repression can intrude upon and undermine entire cultures and turns it into yet another one of his tiresome misogynistic screeds. Previously, these were mere subplots in wider-ranging polemics about the general vileness of humanity. In "The Wicker Man," LaBute's hostility to women comprise the sole purpose of this misbegotten exercise. Even if you don't subscribe to the notion that there is such a thing as a film that just shouldn't be remade, no one who sees this atrocity can be persuaded that "The Wicker Man" needed to be remade **this way.** The saddest part is, you can tell that even if you never saw the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After copious amounts of begging from my girlfriend to watch this, I gave in and watched it.I would have had more fun watching ice melt.The film drags on at a steady pace, constantly hinting that there will be a sudden twist at the end, Nicholas Cage's now dreary acting doing nothing for the film, and BANG! it ends.There was once a time when I used to think "ooh, a new Nicholas Cage film, that's gonna be good" - Now it seems the man is very used to signing up to any old film for a quick buck. Do yourself a favor Nick? hang on for a GOOD film, and make us remember how good you really can be.There was no twist, no massive shock, and then it ends.Please, please, for the love of films, don't watch this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film made me turn my back on remakes, everything about it was weak. From a morbid storyline to a lip bitingly poor acting from the 'cage' and cast crew. I would seriously recommend seeing the original and giving this a wide birth as you will only find yourself regretting watching this. Its hard to really point out a strong point to this movie, but twisting my arm i would say once the credits had rolled up... no seriously. I was hoping for a lot more from this movie. Its one of those films which every once in a while bursts into your head reminding yourself of the torture you had to endure watching this so called 'film'. 1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak Performances In A Silly Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously, sometimes even good actors will agree to star in a movie simply for the sake of the paycheque. Equally obviously, this was one of those examples. What we have here is a decent enough cast (headed by Nicolas Cage and Ellen Burstyn) simply going through the motions without putting anything that even remotely seemed like passion or even effort into it. Lack of passion and effort aside, I thought Cage was in any event rather poorly cast as Edward Malus, a California cop who investigates the disappearance of a young girl on a mysterious island off the coast of Washington State. That, of course, led to one of the anomalies of the movie as Sister Beech (Diane Delano), after she and the women in her café were told by Malus that he was there on official police business, challenged him with the words "official California police business - but this is Washington." True. Someone involved with this movie apparently forgot the concept of police jurisdiction! Alongside Cage's unconvincing portrayal of Malus was the weak performance of Burstyn in a very silly role as Sister Summersisle - a sort of pagan high priestess in this commune of women who like to sacrifice men to gain the approval of the gods and goddesses. Seeing Burstyn with her face painted half blue at least was worthy of a laugh. Yeah, there's a little bit of worthwhile suspense as we wait to find out what actually happened to young Rowan, but overall this just struck me as a truly bad movie. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So terrible I can't think of a witty title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie put the "bad" in bad. I registered on IMDb just to write about how terrible it is. A more suitable title for Wicker Man would be "Avoiding Questions" because that is what each character in this movie does quite successfully. Below is an actual little snippet of conversation which represents the main character's ineptness at getting answers.Edward Malus: "And what if someone just happens to have a boy, what do you do then?" Sister Summers Isle: "That depends." {walks off screen} Edward Mauls: "Let me ask you one other thing because frankly, I just don't get you, I don't get this place." Sister Summers Isle: "Oh you will. In time perhaps." {Condescendingly; with an added dash of foreshadow}The ending sequence in this movie caused me the most pain. The entire plot is ruined over the missing bullet device. In a sense, I was not surprised by this because, had the gun been fully functional, Edward could have jumped forward and grabbed someone (the Matriarch would be a good choice as no sister would risk losing her) to use as a hostage, walked all the way down to the dock, and rowed that little boat to safety. This would have ruined the fun of the people devising the plot.I was, however, surprised to see the gun not work because at no point does he leave it unguarded. When he wakes up from the bee stings, he specifically checks it and the bullets are plainly visible. When he swims in the hole it doesn't show him take the gun off, but even if he took it off and left it by the hatch, he swims directly to the surface when he hears the hatch slam shut and proceeds to wait by there all night. Even if Willow did steal the bullets, a large part of a gun's total weight comes from its ammo content(lead: denser than steel). He would have known the moment he picked it up that something was more amiss than just a cohesive script and plausible literary devices.I could stop here, so I will. The reason I gave this a "2" was for the actual production. I thought the lighting was well done because I barely even noticed it. Sound design was only shabby during flashbacks and when the Edward was "hearing things." In fact, I feel bad for the technical crew because they put in so much hard work and I assume had very little creative license over the script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPOILERS: When Nick Cage Needs Money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicholas Cage is in this movie. That's the only reason I watched it. And I bet he spends at least 5 minutes of every day regretting it. So will I.Anyone who has ever watched old Twilight Zone episodes or movies, or those terrible "Movie of the Week" things that were so popular in the 70s has seen this thing a zillion times. Let me give you a few hints. It is about mysterious CHILDREN and a lot of CORN (get it yet?) in every sense of the word.Obscene acting (and not in the good sense), mind-numbing "plot" from beyond done to death. I was so bored with it (but stuck with it only so that I could warn you away from it, faithful reader...that's just the kind of guy *I* am!) that I actually made up a country song ("I've Got a Sticky Wicket for You"...look for it on the charts). And the only thing more painful than sitting through this drek would be hearing me sing a country song.Stay away...Stay far away...That's the warning someone should have given Cage's character, Cage himself (who must have had some whopper debts in 2006 to be willing to star in this thing), and me...and it's the warning I'm giving you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burning Hatred!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am wincing in pain. I feel robbed. I feel like a small period of my life was laid waste by the absolute pointlessness of this cinematic vomit. I honestly cannot understand why anyone would want to do such a thing.A remake is occasionally excusable, for instance if the original is interesting but technically lacking, or damaged by time, or knee-deep in cultural references which nobody understands anymore.None of those things is true of the original Wicker Man. The references are drawn primarily from Frazer's seminal work on folklore, The Golden Bough (more readily available today than it was when the movie was made). The print of the film is maybe a little grainy but rich in texture, and captures the beauty of the Scottish Islaes in a way few films before or since have done. And the original boasts career-best performances from Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee (even the generally poor Britt Ekland is rather good in that film).Any excuse offered for this nonsense is inadequate. The remake rips great chunks of the original, only ineptly insert them into a hokey horror movie with ridiculous "modernizing" touches (like a female Summerisle) and pathetically obvious references (like the character names being taken from the actors in the original film).It looks pretty good, if film stock is one's measure of a good film. But why add FX? Why add back story? Why does the copper have to have an ex there for him to get all worked up? It's so transparently trying too hard.And failing.Horribly.Every single, leaden step of the way.(For additional perspective, here are some pertinent remarks from my daughter, a mini film critic.)For a start, no effects needed on this movie. There were NO FX on the original, none needed either. Instead of best performances, there were possibly worst! The whole "Oo, I'm scary" thing is ludicrous. The Wickerman is not scary. It is, in the sense that you would never want to meet any of the people on that island, but horror? Please!</fullReview>

Wasn't there a film made in 1944 with Arthur Askey of all people called "Bees in Paradise". Older viewers will remember Arthur Askey on radio in the 30's with Band Waggon and his big film "The Ghost Train". The idea of a connection between Arthur Askey and "Wicker Man" is a bit surrealistic, but does it mean that the producers of the current film have pinched the story from "Bees in Paradise" and the title from "Wicker Man 1"? By the way, according to your records both BIP and WM2 had the most appalling reviews.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>potentially good, ending spoilt it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I ticked this as a spoiler, although i believe it would not be possible to spoil the ending of this movie any more than the film makers did.There was some good bits in it, some tense moments even. but the film stopped just as it was getting interesting, and left me waiting for an ending. a proper ending. To STOP the movie at the point where all along you knew it would end as soon as Nick Cage starts poking around, leaves the viewer feeling cheated.I saw it coming that the main character had been lured there to be sacrificed, as it seems many have before, but i HOPED, (foolishly) that we were following this particular occurrence because this one was different in some way. Justice perhaps is dealt, or he gets away despite the odds. BUT NO! samey samey, the bad guys win, the good guy dies for nothing. The real loser is you, the poor unsuspecting audience.I usually like Nick Cage movies, just cos he is in em, but the ending of this is so unbelievably poor, even his presence isn't enough. Just a little more effort from the makers and this could have been a good film.I watch films for entertainment, not to be angered by the blatant disrespect of the movie goer by whoever is responsible for the ending to this... WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!?!?!?!? should be ashamed. I wish there was minus ratings available.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It deserves all the flack it gets and then a little more. The Wicker Man comes off as one continuous mess further embedding greatness upon the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In years to come and when people look back at certain films from certain times, this version of The Wicker Man will surely go down as one of the more pointless remakes; holding its own up there with films like Psycho and Get Carter. But it's not that The Wicker Man is a dead on arrival film that hurts the more and more you watch it, it's the other sort of 'bad' film, the sort that just feels incompetent at best; the sort that has you thinking if what is going on and how things are unfolding is really how they wanted it to all go down.The primary problem The Wicker Man has holding it back the whole time is its aspiration for success. This is an American remake of a British (or more broadly, a 'European') film from many, many years ago. The film in question brought up many issues to do with religion and had many things to say, politically, about an ever changing world and society. The film raised issues to do with what's right; who's right and tried to make a statement on the balance between new beliefs in then 1970s Britain and older, much older religious beliefs to do with the ancient world ? namely sacrifices and the dismissal of science and the attention to nature and mother Earth being the sole thing to take care of in life. But this edition of The Wicker Man updates timeframe and setting into early 21st Century America, falling pretty darned flat in the process whilst delivering a filmic experience that is unintentionally funny at best.So what's the film actually about? Policeman Edward Malus (Cage) travels to an isolated island on which a ritualistic community get by in the modern-age without phone signals or electricity. It seems the daughter of Malus' ex-partner has gone missing and Malus is the man to find her after he received a letter explaining the situation. After an opening involving a traffic accident, we get rather a quick title card flash up complete with bizarre sinister music: 'The Wicker Man' it says and the odd sensation of 'was that supposed to perhaps be scary?' lands itself for the first time. It is a feeling that does not lift. The film is a series of pratfalls and unintentional scenes that play out in bizarre and comical fashion. Along the way, Malus will beg his way onto a flight to the island when informing the pilot he was a policeman would have been enough; he will swim down darkened underwater tunnels seemingly without reason and he will be chased through woods while dressed in a bear suit.In fact, the film is so far detached from not only the original but most films in general that basic logic at times will be ignored. In the original, every scene after arriving at the island which doubled up as the pre-film credit sequence was an eerie and foreboding clue as to the fact she may exist and everyone's in on something. Here, the protagonist is needlessly given a prior tragedy which acts as a mere reason for him to have 'scary' flashbacks and other such hallucinations involving the young girl he could not save from a car crash ? notice the obvious parallel here: hero has chance to redeem oneself after prior tragic event by finding a girl on an island dystopia. But the film for the best part is a series of illogical scenes rather than strange establishments of bizarre townsfolk.Here, we get Malus messing about in a farmyard barn climbing the beams and then falling off them; we get an accidentally hilarious exchange between two people during a wood-chopping scene: the girl wood chopping wants to leave the island and sees Malus as her ticket out but it's against the rules to leave; and yet the inhabitants can come and go as they please anyway. There is a scene in a classroom in which a chicken flies out of a desk: what's it doing in there? How long has it been in there? Did they put it in there for him to find? And if so, how did they know Malus was coming and would stop at the school in the first place? Then there is the brief revelation when it appears Malus has previously had sex, completely going against why the original's antagonists did what they did and the girl Malus is looking for is connected to him more so than he first thought. Also, the way in which Willow (Beahan) maintains a 'deer in the headlights' expression throughout and constantly gets-half-way-through-a-sentence...........but then stops and allows Cage to finish it for her. That grated on me very quickly. There is also the rare instance in the film of a 'dream within a dream' sequence. I haven't seen one of them in a while. The scene in which Cage swims down into a watery abyss for absolutely no reason other than he has a 'hunch' the girl might be down there and then gets locked in overnight has to evoke laughs of some sort.Then there is the climax which is ruined in the first place by way of having seen the original. Rather than sacrifice someone INTO the ground so that the crops may grow back OUT of it, the theory on this American Summersisle is that you sacrifice someone into the ground so that BEES, which are of a third party nature, will begin to re-produce honey like they used to. Where's the logic of killing someone so that something completely unconnected with what you're doing MIGHT begin to do what they're supposed to do, once again? I don't know, maybe using the word 'logic' is a bad move here but for sure, the epilogue at the very end proves that the cycle of sacrifices (and idiocy) will not stop any time soon in this crazy (or downright stupid) little community.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Waste of Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At this point in entertainment history saleability has become the leading factor in determining a project's go ahead. Every successful film of the last 40 years (even those of Asia and Europe)is being remade and mostly with disastrous results. Of all the hideous reinterpretations of recent years The Wicker Man takes the prize for the worst. The original 1973 film is a believable masterpiece with a setting, although a fantasy, that has an authenticity due to it having drawn on a real history. The re-make is a misguided attempt to relocate this historically founded story to a country that isn't old enough to have had such beliefs. The entire symbolism of the original is lost. Blind faith, virginity, ignorance, self-righteousness and temptation lead the original cop through the maze of experience to prove his worthiness. Nicholas Cage has none of these traits and is just a pawn in a ludicrous plot. The only good thing about this film is it has rekindled people's desire to see the original again and experience it's hypnotic charm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, they did it again. Took a little gem of a movie and remade it in the usual way -- bigger stars, more special effects, and thoroughly dumbed down so that the kind of minds of the targeted audience, which is evidently judged to be of the same caliber as the producers, won't be subject to the stress of either waiting or thinking.As far as I could tell, before I had to shut it off and run for the Pepto-Bismol, the story is roughly the same. A police investigator comes to an isolated place to investigate the reported disappearance of a young girl.In the original, the villagers tolerate the outsider (Nicholas Cage here) and treat him with polite evasiveness edged with a bit of impatience, the way you might deal with a child who keeps asking where babies come from. It's an odd attitude -- wrong, but only subtly wrong. Here, the villagers are openly hostile from the beginning. Cage (as Officer Malus) manages to get a room at the village inn but it's accompanied by the remark, "Well, if you won't take a hint -- ". If the goal is anything like that in the original, this is not only over-obvious, it actually militates against the villager's success.Much of the sex and theology of the original is toned down, at least as far as I could tell. The sergeant is no longer a virgin, nor is he very religious, for instance. (How could Nicholas Cage possibly be a virgin?) It was hard enough to believe that the original investigator (Edward Woodward) was a virgin -- but that is precisely what made him suitable for the role he was to take in village affairs, his staunch and unyielding Scottish Presbyterianism. Of course Nicholas Cage is an easier character for a modern audience to identify with, and Cage does a good job. Perhaps it's a minor quibble that one of the original's chief plot points is sacrificed so that we can now more comfortably put ourselves in the cop's unambiguous shoes.Here are a few more notes, then I'll quit. (1) This does not happen in the original, but Cage spots a girl at night who seems to be the missing youngster, chases her into an old barn, investigates with only a flashlight, falls through the floor of the loft and hangs by his fingers over a forest of upright pitch forks. Unlike the implements, the scene is pointless. (2) In the original, Woodward is quizzing an elementary school class and investigates the missing girl's empty desk. Lifting the top, he finds a beetle tethered to a string to a nail in the center of the otherwise empty space, so the beetle is slowly crawling round and round, tightening the thread around the nail. Woodward registers surprise and disgust and remonstrates with the class over their cruelty. In this one, Cage opens the lid of the desk, the music shrieks, and a great big black bird flaps out into his face in a series of rapid cuts. Instead of an off-kilter but thoroughly plausible event, you get a cheap shock. (3) Not in the original. Cage strolls to the end of a pier and sits down. Then he notices the body of a drowned blond girl locked in a cage under the water. He strips off his jacket, dives in, and brings the body of Rowan Woodward out of the cage and onto the pier, where he holds it in his dripping lap. Then -- "HUH?", and he shakes his head. It was all a daydream. (4) Not in the original. Cage walks into a field and is attacked by bees -- as in "The Swarm," "The Killer Bees," et al. (5) The original music by Paul Giovanni, at once sprightly, bawdy, and ominous, is replaced with a by-the-numbers mystery score straight out of a computer archive labeled "Mystery Music."By the way, did the movie end happily? It should have. The mystical tragedy of the original just wouldn't fit on this pandering piece of junk. On the other hand a happy ending would deprive the remake of another crack at shocks and violence. On the bright side: I think this movie gave me an idea though. How about a remake of "Citizen Kane" with Brad Pitt? No? Okay, then. How about remaking "Battleship Potemkin," only instead of rebellious Russian sailors we make them honest cops, and instead of Tsarist soldiers we make them a gang of international terrorists who speak with German accents? I see Keanu Reeves in the lead, with Angelina Jolie as the love interest.</fullReview>

But here there is a scene by scene remake of the 1973 classic as an attempt to make a quick buck. As usual the only appeal will be for those who haven't seen the original and those who will watch with anger at how the seminal Hammer film is being desecrated by this unimaginative rehash of the classic. Nicholas Cage who can be a great actor in the right role must have been cast for this following the comments of 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' that he had no sexual spark with his actress. So then suitable for the role of the virginal police officer sent to investigate the disappearance of the girl on the Scottish Island. Just stick with the original 1973 film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am so terrifically disappointed in this film, that I feel compelled to immediately get the highly regarded and lauded 1973 British original to view as a form of an antidote of some kind. I thought to myself, "If Nicolas Cage is in it, how bad could it be?". Now, I sadly realize - that is far from any quality guarantee - this film is pretty awful.Reading the many reviews, it seems that the original is as good as this one is bad. The only thing good about this film is some of the scenic location shots. Otherwise, the whole film is absolutely dreadful at every level.The one scene in the film I would like to comment on is toward the end of the film, when Nicolas Cage's character is running around the island looking for his daughter. He comes out of a house and suddenly has this look on his face like he just saw the most horrible sight imaginable. (Nicolas Cage is a great actor - so making this expression well is what a great actor does - and he does it very well.) The scene then cuts to simply show that his bike was taken. Then the scene cuts back to his face and looks slightly annoyed and he starts running.How bizarre is that? It disrupts the already lumbering, creaking pseudo-momentum in a way that is laughable and seems as if it was done as a joke.I also have to add that the dialog and plot progression was so bad that I found myself groaning and complaining out loud DURING the film. That is something I very rarely do. Don't waste your time seeing this bewildering wreck of a movie. I am going to go find the 1973 British original...</fullReview>

The original Wicker Man was a masterpiece, a suspenseful thriller with a powerful conclusion. This is not. the acting is atrocious and the script dire. The only entertainment that can be drawn from this film comes from mockery. The "How'd it get burned?!" montage about half way through the film, for example, or Nic Cage kicking that woman in the face, provide brief moments of hilarity. it could be argued that Cage's character's eventual fate is preferable to watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually spent 3 hours on a crappy movie this morning. First watching it for 2 hours then register me here for 1 hour just tell you all out there that this was the worst movie ever. The movie starts really good in it have the feeling you get from "the others" with Kidman but later on it feels more like a episode of "Lost". Not enough fantasy to finish the movie and way to complicated to end the movie properly. Nicholas Cage sold out pretty bad this time. So if you don't like crappy movies save your money and buy an ice cream or something cause it will make you happier afterward.Remember me saying this is the worst movie ever i have seen "crossroads" with Spears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was simple dreadful. To take an excellent, thoughtful and genuinely scary film and to create this hash from it is blasphemous.Where it kept to the same lines as the original it was always outshone. On every level it was unable to generate the creepy suspenseful feel of the original. In the original one could believe Summerisle existed, it was on the surface normal, it was what was underneath that menaced. In this version, everything was unreal (and thus unthreatening) from the start.Where the film deviated from the original it normally debased itself. The gratuitous violence and CGI did nothing to save it.The acting was uniformly porcine but perhaps we were able to sense the guilt the actors had when they realised what they were doing</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On an IMDb scale this movie should be close to a .125. For entertainment value however, I highly recommend this movie for a good laugh. The plot reminds me a lot of a show like Lost or a movie twist like the Usual Suspects, only not good.Whoever wrote the screenplay for this remake must at some point during the writing process have asked themselves "what the hell I am writing down?" Movies like these give me hope that I can get my screenplay, or pretty much any screenplay, made into a feature film with wide release.Somewhere, somehow this remake got the green light to go into production. The reason why that happened should have been made into a movie in place of The Wicker Man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found it unintentionally funny. As I must add at least ten lines of text, I guess I must expound on why I found it so. Cage's deadpan delivery had me laughing. The actual lines he had to say at times, were hilarious. Anytime I see a bear suit in actual use, it's funny. What spoilers? The only people that would watch this, are those that had seen the first WickerMan, and already know what's going to happen. I can't imagine anyone else taking the time to look at it, besides to point and mock.It's like a small town Renaissance festival gone awry. I guess you can add to the experience by gnawing on one of those inappropriate and greasy turkey legs.</fullReview>

They ought to annihilate the brat bitches in the school, wipe out that damn teacher, butcher the twins, blast the other women and men, and burn that damn leader of theirs - after hanging her.

		<fullReview>I don't think I have ever laughed this much in my life. Nicholas Cage was appalling. Surprise, Surprise. God Bless him, He tries. Me and my friends made the mistake of choosing this film to watch to 'scare us' we ended up absolutely wetting ourselves. There was too many loose ends left unanswered. For example, the beginning image of the car crash had no clear relevance to the film. Was it a dream? Or a flash back? and if so who were the people in the car? Can anyone explain this as the film didn't. The little girl in the car and Rowan looked very similar which was very, very, very confusing. If they were the same little girl then it makes no sense as Nicholas Cages character had no knowledge that the child was his until he reached the island. And why did he dress up as bear? And why did he leave the bear feet on? It was all so confusing. It makes my head spin. I wasn't all awful, the strangeness of the villagers on the island was conveyed very well. If you fancy a laugh then I'd recommend it to anyone. Otherwise I'd give it a miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW! This film has even less of a plot then the movie "Cube." Nicholas Cage's acting was excellent of course, but the poor man didn't have any kind of script to follow! Maybe they made up the movie as they went along. Seriously though, there is absolutely no point to this movie and thats all there is to it. The Wicker Man is a film that keeps the viewers questioning, "When will this get resolved?" Sadly it doesn't, and once the ending credits hit the screen, it left me laughing in my seat. If you're considering to buy it, THEN DON'T! I wouldn't even spend the money to rent it. I'm telling you now, if you take the time to watch it, you'll only be wasting your time.</fullReview>

At the end, Nicholas-cage-character dies....6. But is it _really_ the end? No! In a special and totally unexpected twist, we are threatened with the possibility of ... A SEQUEL!

		<fullReview>I'm a fan of Nicholas Cage, so against what people said, I rented this movie. It was really good till the last 15 minutes. Then the whole thing flopped. Everything that had made the movie good before was shattered. I wanted Nick to blow the brains out of the lady who was leading the village thing. But no, she had to take the bullets out of his gun. Then Nick is burned alive and two girls go out to get more people. If they had just let Nicholas Cage blow everyone's brains out and make it out alive, I would have considered buying it. But unfortunately, my wish didn't come true.Go see the movie if you like depressing films that take away the whole plot with the ending. Like I said before, the movie would have been great if they had made a better ending. But the ending screwed it up so bad, I have to give this film a 2.I suppose the only spoiler here is that I tell the ending, but its a spoiler.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Guilty Pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leveling off at an extremely chilly 14% approval rating on Rottentomatoes.com, THE WICKER MAN got pummeled by critics large and small. Some called it "over-the-top" while others mentioned its unbelievability factor. Both criticisms are correct, but that doesn't mean that The Wicker Man isn't a guilty pleasure for some viewers ...like me.Nicholas Cage (WORLD TRADE CENTER) stars as Officer Edward Malus, a beat cop who one day stops a car that had a doll fall from its window while speeding along a desolate highway. When Edward returns the doll, the little girl in the back seat again tosses it back onto the road. Edward goes to pick it up again and while he's scooping it up, a semi smashes into the car on the shoulder, eventually killing both the driver/mother and the daughter in the backseat.Haunted by this horrible event, Officer Malus seeks refuge at home whenever he can. But a letter soon arrives from a lost love named Willow (Kate Beahan), beckoning him to come to her at a place called Summersisle in Washington State. The letter goes on to say that Willow has had a child named Rowan (Erika-Shaye Gair, RV) that has mysteriously disappeared.Once on the island of Summersisle, Edward quickly surmises that all is not right here. Women rule the place and the few men present are docile. He also notes (with a hint of sarcasm) the tree-ish first names of all its residents (the aforementioned Rowan and Willow, along with Beech and several other colorful names).Willow, Edward's lost love, finally tells him that Rowan is his daughter, thus pumping up his need to find her, dead or alive.As the minutes tick by, Edward discovers a strange cult-like following, almost Druid in fashion, that stretches from one end of this small island to the other. Was Rowan a victim of some sort of ritualistic demagoguery? Was she sacrificed and burned alive? Nicholas Cage has never been one of my favorite actors, but he is entertaining at times. His part in LORD OF WAR was one of his more recent acting successes. Here in The Wicker Man, he's entertaining, too, if often times a bit over the top (as the critics have pointed out...the obvious part being the now infamous bee helmet scene where he screams, "What is that?! Oh bees! Bees! They're in my eyes!").Probably the biggest boost for the film is that its pacing is done pretty well, gradually ratcheting up the tension as the story progresses. The ending is also a bit of a shocker, especially the leg breaking scene that nearly made me nauseous, and brought to memory the Kathy Bates bit in MISERY.The whole premise, however, is pretty faulty. The Druids never made it to America, but some of their fans certainly did later on (much later on). There's also the fact that Edward (Cage) is a cop, and if a cop went missing for any length of time, people would start looking and asking questions.Even so, if you force yourself to ignore these blatant oversteps, you might find The Wicker Man a guilty pleasure, like chocolate syrup on a rapidly melting sundae.P.S. Much has been made of the fact that this film is a remake of Anthony Shaffer's 1973 film by the same name starring Christopher Lee and Edward Woodward. Not having seen this version, I can only comment on the story seen in this updated version</fullReview>

Nicholas Cage is a great actor and he makes this movie great! All the women were very odd and I didn't enjoy the parts with just them in it.

		<shortDescription>Farce disguised as thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you go in without expectations, or expect very little, you will not be disappointed. The movie is advertised as a thriller, but in fact I found it to be absolutely hilarious. I really wondered whether the comedy was intentional because it was just so blatant. Cage's cheesy lines and delivery (this could be said for most of the actors actually) provided a number of laugh out loud moments. Especially memorable was the scene at the end when Cage keeps getting shot (or beaten...hard to say because he's off screen) and with each shot he keeps yelling out something new - totally reminiscent of Austin Powers when one of the guys goes down the shaft and yells out "I'm not quite dead yet" with each new blow. Once Cage started yelling out "BITCHES", I was nearly in tears. Haven't seen the original so I can't say anything about how the remake compares, but I would almost recommend this movie for the sheer comedic value.</fullReview>

Another large problem with this film was that most horror classics at least pretend to have SOME morality.

The most serious parts of the film (flashbacks, etc) were met with laughter throughout the theater. No one took this story in a serious tone in which the director meant it to be taken. In a time where it looks as though Nic Cage was coming into his own, he takes on a role that does nothing for him, possible damaging his connection with fans. Although the effort was admirable, the plot was silly and the acting sub par. Good try....but I wouldn't even recommend this feature as a weekend rental unless you enjoy "B" movies and acting. A good waste of $14 and sad end to a good date....very disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't cry over spilled honey...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw it... In New York city, utilizing the Fandango web service (you never know if these things will sell out or not), I paid $12.50 to see this film.On a scale of $1 to $12.50, the new "The Wicker Man" is somewhere between $1 and $2.50. HUGE SPOILERS AHEAD.OK, as a "Wicker Man" purist, at first I didn't want to even know a remake was to be released. Why mess with perfection; what's been done has been done: it's not a play or serial that's meant to be redone. Plus, the only person you could get to replace Christopher Lee would be Christopher Lee. Nevertheless, assuming it's done well, I could see the story translating really well to a U.S. setting, with some old cult, well-isolated, well-insulated, still practicing that Old Time Religion...Sure it's derivative! What isn't? Well-told, this story always packs a wallop and is solid, horror fun. The original Wicker Man has a disturbing, unresolved, unhappy ending. The story doesn't close (what happens next? who knows?!) and that's it's lasting effect: will Lord Summerisle be sacrificed if the next crop fails as Inspector Howie cries out in hopeless desperation? Good question, but you'll never know because the film is over.Not this Wicker Man, though. In general casting terms, OK, Nicholas Cage is good. His character of Edward Malus (ohhh! "Edward" chasing Rowan "Woodward" - nice, and Malus? As in "Malleus Maleficarum?" What a clever touch!) has plenty of attitude but he lacks the religious stick up his ass that Insp. Howie had. That was essential to the story because it established genuine antagonism between Howie and the Summerisle cult. Howie's a Roundhead flunky for all it matters and he's up against the Druid of Druids. Tough luck for the Roundheads... Cage's character, without question a typical, modern American agnostic can only look to cheap, truck-stop self-help books to fight his inner demons and probably could care less what a bunch of hippie, whack-jobs believe in.Ellen Burstyn. For the sake of argument, I couldn't think of a better choice. She has serious horror movie credibility. And she can take charge of the scene - like her character's supposed to.Plot holes: OK, so the switch is from crops in general to honey. OK, so the Summersisle cult is really a colony of bees with multiple, fertile queens with an uber-queen at the head (Burstyn). No problem, makes for an interesting story, sort of like a reverse of L. Sprague de Camp's "Rogue Queen." Well, then, why not run with that story? Let's say that Nick Cage is now on the island - get him to replace the old man in charge of shagging the non- menopausal queens! Throw the old guy into the Wicker Man and be done with it!No, no... We're going to try and match the original movie line-for-line, make-up nuance for make up nuance, costume for costume... and it didn't work. Howie's research made it clear why the folks were in costume. All Cage/Woodward's "research" did was determine that a) the cult aborted most of the males (why? Not good enough? The men hanging around were weaklings - why not explain it some more?), and b) someone conveniently left out a manual on ritual human sacrifice - too easy. I must give credit though: the scene with the aborted male fetuses in jars was disturbing, disturbing at the right "Wicker Man" level, yet the film just didn't run with it. Make Cage burn with right-to-life anger; let's hear the Summersisle girls explain their pre-emptive patricide, give the story some interesting, provocative, controversial dialog. Make the audience uncomfortable - instead, there were regular laughs from the audience.Why are the women chanting "The drone must die"? Did he finish fertilizing the "colony"? Apparently, he fathered one - but is that enough? Is Willow to be the next queen? Will Rowan then follow in her footsteps? If they're the royal line, don't they need more heirs? We saw multiple pregnant girls? Was it all the old man in the bed's work? Did Cage's character do anything that would distinguish himself a drone other than being a man?Annoyances: why is a waitress in California talking like some stereotypical "southern" dunce (using "them" instead of "those"? That didn't make sense.Cheap film: Is the audience so stupid that Cage has to scream "my legs!" so we'll all know that the Queen Bee's minions have broken his legs - off camera? Why not have Sister Summersisle say "bind his legs!" or "break his legs!"? Or similar? And why'd they kill the pilot? That, if any action would bring the entire State of Washington police "swarming" all over the island? They didn't even get rid of the evidence well enough! A flight plan was probably filed! The guy might have a family! There's an oil slick on the water! What about other people who needed use of the plane? There's bound to be an investigation, ladies!I want my money back part: The epilogue, "six months later" - what the hell? Now the Summersisle cult goes out hunting men? For what? If they'd kept Nick Cage drugged up or gave him some special potion to "keep it up," they'd be saved all the trouble. Double I want my money back: the film is dedicated to Johnny Ramone - who, no doubt is rolling in his grave. I didn't hear any punk rock music in the film...Four people (two couples) walked out of the movie. One couple left about forty minutes into things (I figured they just didn't get it and were bored). The second couple left after just over an hour - that I didn't get: weren't they interested in how it ended? The theater wasn't crowded, it was an evening show, on a weekend.</fullReview>

A lot of eye candy in the film, but some things just totally failed to give credibility to the story.Nicolas did a brilliant job portraying a totally inept cop.

Not a whole lot made any sense during the movie, and questions the viewer had were never really answered by the end. At least in the original, everything was laid out-ducks all in a row- and by the time the magnificent, horrific finale came, it was all realized and wonderful. Tied up with a pretty ribbon, finished. I didn't like the fact that the old blind twins mentioned the wicker man in the beginning of the movie. And in the schoolhouse was a cage with a miniature wicker man hanging inside of it. It was better in the original when the wicker man was revealed at the very end, without any fore-knowledge. I nearly freaked out when i saw there was an epilogue. AN EPILOGUE!!! For heaven's sake, they could have done without it. However, I did like the fact that in the police station there was a poster (missing person, possibly?) with the wonderful Edward Woodward's face on it!! And the fact that Cage's character was named Edward, and Rowan's last name had been changed from Morrison(in the original) to Woodward. Teehee. Kudos to that!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened to Nicolas Cage?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One wonders if Nicolas Cage read the script before he showed up on the set for the production of this film. You find yourself asking, "Is this a horror movie?" "Is it a crime drama?" "How about a psycho-thriller?" A quarter of the way in you're not sure if you want to switch theaters. Halfway through you wished you had but figure there must be some merit to this flick; after all, the photography is great. Three quarters through, you find yourself antsy to just leave and who cares what happens. This is an M. Night Shyamalan wannabe without any positive, uplifting message. It wasn't worth the money for the ticket and I wouldn't buy the DVD. It gets a "3" simply for the photography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rarely am moved enough by a movie to bother writing my thoughts down to share with others. This movie did so. Not because it was a grand cinematic masterpiece. No, sadly, there are no masterpieces to be found here. To put it mildly, this movie was AWFUL.My mother went with me to see it, which is strange because she said she had seen the original and afterwords stated this one was just like it. Why on earth did she agree to see it again? A better question may be "Why on earth did Hollywood MAKE it again?" There are so many great screenplays out there that get passed over for this rubbish.I have never in my life demanded my money back after watching a movie. But I surely would have had I not won the tickets to this one off the radio.To sum it up. This was a waste of 2 hours of my life. Also a waste of all the hours that the actors and crew put in and all the money spent making it/promoting it.Such a waste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't tell how angry I was on my way out of the cinema. When I saw Nicolas Cage in the cast I thought it would be nice, but not. I can't believe he agreed to film it. At the beginning I thought it would be a nice mystery but the more the story progressed, the more foolish it became. At a point all characters seemed ridiculous - talking and acting like crazy. Some scenes made the audience laugh, although they should have been tragic or at least serious. The costumes - I was wondering whether they used the same in Star Trek. And the end was such a crap, I just can't find words to describe it. So are you going to watch it? Please, don't!</fullReview>

It was so completely non-believable from the start. There were too many times that I thought, "There is no way a policeman would do that". People left the theater. I should have left. For a while I thought that maybe Ellen Byrsten's appearance would lift it up. No, she just fell flat on her face too. I can't believe James Franco agreed to do this movie. Albeit it was a small part but his name is still attached to a stink movie. Nick Cage, Ellen Byrsten, Leelee Sobieski... should have made a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the wicker man has got to be one of the most heart stopping, most occult thrillers of all cult/horror /thriller films.the reason its so disturbing in ways is that its so... strange and the whole island is a place of worship instead of a normal everyday island. in my opinion the scene were Nichole's cage goes on a hunt to find his daughter, he notices that most of the people have been... mutilated in some way. this film is a bit like the Blair witch project because its occult, but the Blair witch project doesn't have ceremony's of worship and initiation's of mutilation. (such as the scene when cage finds that man on the docks and finds that his eyes have been sown up). thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wicker Man a Hollow Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In The Wicker Man, Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) is a cop. During the course of a routine traffic stop, there's a terrible accident that injures him and leaves him helpless to rescue a mother and her daughter from a fiery death. Far worse than his physical injuries are the nightmares ? occurring both when he's asleep and awake ? involving the people he couldn't save. So when a letter arrives from a woman he loved years ago, he's all but helpless to refuse her plea for assistance in finding her missing daughter.So Malus travels to Summersisle where Willow (Kate Beahn) now lives. He has a difficult time getting to the secluded island, and once there, is viewed with a good deal of suspicion by the island's mostly female inhabitants. Willow, who is called Sister Willow by the other women, takes him aside and warns him that the others will lie to him. But she also emphasizes what she believes to be looming danger to her missing daughter Rowan (Erika-Shaye Gair).Malus fuels his search for Rowan not only with his memories of his old relationship with Willow but with his anguish over his inability to save another little girl from her fate. He needs that commitment since he finds his efforts thwarted at virtually every turn by women who are hostile at best, and who look him in the eye and lie as a matter of course.Sister Beech (Diane Delano reluctantly offers him a place to stay, but remains leery of the California cop. Sister Rose (Molly Parker) is a teacher who expends most of her energies teaching her charges lessons with which Malus thoroughly disagrees. Dr. Moss (Frances Conroy) seems willing to care for everyone ? even Malus ? but she also comes across as evasive, which causes Malus to become more determined than ever to get to the bottom of the mystery.Malus finally has the opportunity to meet the woman in charge of the isolated community. In a conversation with Sister Summersisle (Ellen Burstyn), Malus' internal alarm bells are ringing louder than ever. But he ignores his intuition in the hopes of saving Willow's daughter and thus redeeming himself. What Malus doesn't realize, of course, is that the dangers on Summersisle extend far beyond the life of one missing little girl...Nicolas Cage is typically a capable actor, even when he's saddled with a less than optimal script. In the Case of The Wicker Man, background information has it that Cage was so affected when he viewed the original that he promoted the remake. Perhaps he thought better of it as filming commenced, though, because his performance here is all but phoned in. Every emotion is heightened to the point of melodrama in an episode of "bad acting theatre;" every facial expression is both stereotypical and exaggerated.Frances Conroy is fine, and Molly Parker is just terrific. Supporting cast members Leelee Sobieski and Diane Delano are also all right (though Sobieski is miscast in a role that requires a far more delicately pretty woman than she is). Ellen Burstyn is thoroughly wasted in a part that sees her spew some of the most godawful lines ever penned in a movie with a budget, while Kate Beahn is just plain godawful (if there's somebody else out there who can speak more woodenly, or convey less emotion despite huge, doe-like eyes, I don't know who she might be).The greatest insult to audiences (not to mention fans of the original movie), though, is a really bad screenplay. Director Neil LaBute penned the script, which is based on the original by the late Anthony Shaffer. While his direction is largely okay, and the cinematography spectacular, the script is rarely less than implausible, and it often crosses the line into the just plain ridiculous. Though the movie begins with some promise with the grave psychological impact of the accident the lead character witnesses, it quickly devolves into a series of utterly predictable and entirely unbelievable events.The bottom line: Think about renting the original (again, I can't recommend it not having seen it, but a lot of people who have seen it do), and don't even think for a moment about seeing the 2006 remake. It's not worth even the price of a ticket let alone the time you'll never get back.POLITICAL NOTES: One of the most ham-handed plot devices in The Wicker Man involves what is apparently an isolated community of witches (though the words "pagan" or "Wiccan" are never mentioned, there is a reference to Salem as well as to various medieval pagan ceremonies and celebrations that imply strongly that that's what they are). Every witch that I know ? and I do know a few ? would be appalled by vast majority of the actions depicted in The Wicker Man. Unfortunately, there are those devout fundamentalist Christians who would take every opportunity to condemn pagans as minions of Satan. Though they're wrong, films like The Wicker Man will give them the unneeded opportunity to gloat, "I told you so!" FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Wicker Man is rated PG-13 for "disturbing images and violence, language, and thematic issues." In the case of portions of the story line, PG-13 may actually be a little weak though none of those thematic issues are visually depicted in an R-rated manner. If you've got kids who insist on seeing The Wicker Man because it's being billed as a horror film (the most horrific thing about it is the movie itself rather than the plot per se), I'd deny unqualified permission to kids of 14 or so and younger. As for the rest, well, the good news is that you can always tell them that you told them so after they've been as duly disappointed as I was by this dud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They don't make Wicker Mans like they use to. Oh well, watch it anyway, it's different.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Concerning the new remake of the Wicker Man (WM)(2006), let's get the 500-pound gorilla out of the way first, the Wicker Man (1973). Having seen the first Wicker Man (1973) numerous times and wearing out the CD. It has qualities that make it unique to the point where both movies need to be judged on their own merits because they are different (frankly the 1973 version has a better twist on being twisted, thus is better IMHO). It's kind of like comparing Lost Horizon (1937) (a drama) with Lost Horizon (1973)(a musical). I could also wax poetic about the many differences to fill a book, but that is really a waste of everyones time nitpicking. Nevertheless, purge your mind totally of the WM 1973 version and watch the WM 2006 version it's a fair movie that has some interesting plot twists that make the new WM worth a watch.Quick Plot Summery: A police officer fails to rescue a woman and her little girl from a burning car and is put on medial leave from the trauma. The officer later receives a letter from a long ago ex-fiancée, who returned home to a secluded esoteric commune on Summersisle island in the northwest US. Her daughter is now missing and she, fearing the worse, pleads for the officer's help to locate her daughter. The officer goes to Summersisle, only to discover a matriarchal (female centered) commune more in tune with the old ways (pagan), free from the "normal" world's repressions. Summersisle's main cash export is honey, but last years honey production was "cursed" for the first time in many years and the missing girl was blamed. During his stay, the officer gets the picture that he is wanted like the plague and receives very little help. While making his investigations, the officer comes to the conclusion that the missing girl will be sacrificed in a pagan ceremony to ensure a bountiful harvest in the future. The officer tries to rescue the missing girl, only to find that he was being played a fool from the start of the movie in a twisted game of cat and mouse. It seems the commune does not sacrifice their own, but outsources the honor to outsiders and the officer now has that honor. You need to see the movie to see what befalls the officer and the recruiting of new sacrifices for the commune.Interesting Points: The commune is modeled on one big happy bee hive. The women are the "worker bees," the men are the "drones" and there is one "queen bee." Little if any technology used by the commune. Low tech.The commune is not based on traditional Christian values, which throws the officer off balance.The scenery is peaceful, beautiful, simple, and clean which is the icing that covers the hard, rigid, chess like calculating, but maniacal nature of the commune.Disappointing Points: Sometimes the plot drags and several scenes that did not add much to the plot were stuck in to increase the weird factor.Yes, we get all the many, many points that the commune is based on a bee hive, now get on with the plot. The bees covered nude girl on a chair really clarified everything . . . not.Frankly, the whole car crash and burn scene at the beginning could be eliminated IMHO. I would have had the officer officially visit the island to investigate the missing child to save time at the film's start.The officer does not seem to conduct himself in an official manner. Beating up several women, holding a gun on a petite bicycle riding school teacher, and waving around a badge like a fan seems like over kill. By the time the officer makes it to the end of the movie, you start to sympathize with the communes actions and wonder if the police department will even care if this officer comes up missing.All the flashbacks and hallucinations wear thin after a few times, especially when they do not help the plot. If you want weird, then show weird. Many of us movie goers do not know what May poles are for and what pagans believe, so a little hint or two would have make the movie less boring and add true strangeness.I now know why the commune has an "only outsider can be sacrifices" rule. If I lived in the commune long enough, I would volunteer as the next sacrifice just to break the monotony. And you thought the "normal" outside world was repressing the spirit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is OK! ( This was a review written by me in a news paper in NorthEast Philadelphia)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the middle of the night, and rain pouring outside....a movie called "The Wicker Man" was reviewed. This movie is full of bull **** when it says its scary or anything related. Yet this movie is weird. The Wicker Man, starts out with a man, he tries to save a girl from an accident but it blows up, supposedly killing the little girl and mother. After 6 months or so, Hes taking drugs and seems very depressed. Then he gets a letter from this woman, saying her daughter is missing and that shes his run away engagement. He goes to find this girl, which is on a private island. Once there the movie begins. But it sucks. There are too many scenes where he is running around, too less scenes of something scary or that would progress the story. And in watching this movie, the characters kept changing the story around about the where abouts of this little girl, and i could tell the man was very annoyed and confused too. This movie doesn't bring anything to the table accept screaming at the end. The only problem with this movie was it was too funny. It had stupid scenes where this guy would see someone that had been torn in half, eyes missing, and mouth tied shut, and he still shakes him to see if hes alive.It had good photography and thats what I will say is only good. I also think this movie is too crazy to even take seriously, because if someone runs away from somewhere, gets engaged and loves being out of the place she once was, who in the hell will believe she would go back. Its a good date movie with laughs and occasional jumps and scares, yet it just isn't that good of a movie for those die-hard horror moviegoers.The only thing i can say about the guy in this movie and his stupidity, shame on you! I give this movie 2 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A dreadful disappointment for a number of reasons: uneven pacing, a miscast lead, the lack of subtlety, loss of (religious) context and beautiful soundtrack from the original, as well as elements of misogyny: the audience I saw the film with laughed when Malus (Cage) punches women towards the film's denouement. And here lies one of the film's greatest flaw. In the original, you suspended your disbelief as Lord Summerisle, an Aleister Crowley type figure, dominates proceedings. Anyone with a knowledge of pagan religions would realise that women are creative, nurturing forces in nature.The film fails on so many levels. I went in with an open mind, hoping it would be better than I anticipated but I realise why so little publicity was released beforehand. Because it is a huge, leaden disappointment.There are some interesting scenes: the old women who greet Malus like the witches from Macbeth, the blind sisters. The film does possess some frightening moments (the barn &amp; the cellar in the darkness) but it is reminiscent of a Stephen King film, a trip on a fright ride and detracts from the genuine foreboding and creepiness of the original.The bee motif is interesting up to a point but overplayed though it was a clever idea to have Malus lured to the island as part of some deliberate plan to secure a male sacrifice. But the original made more sense. Why is it so hard for an audience to imagine the policeman as a virgin? In fact, a possible reworking by Robin Hardy of the original set in contemporary Scotland has two members of the Silver Ring Thing become involved with a pagan community.However, the few pluses barely make up for a poor script/reworking and it is damning that many of the best scenes are those based on the original. There are also so many plot holes. Why murder the pilot of the flying boat? Why not simply render the character as a woman who is party to the plot? In fact, I laughed when Malus is finally confronted with his fate. LaBute even contrives to reduce what should be a horrific moment with a trace of farce as Cage whines 'If you think this is going to save your god-damned honey'. The ending in the original is so powerful precisely because of Howie's faith and his genuine terror. Cage, like me, seems to welcome his fate because it puts out us of our misery.A word of advice to anyone financing a remake by Neil Labute or anyone in Hollywood, like the Ring franchise. Don't bother. And if Stateside audiences are too lazy to watch the originals either because they look dated or are in subtitles, then they really do lack imagination.As someone British, please try not to ruin more of our classic films. I shudder to think what a US studio would do to 'Black Narcissus'. Probably have Scarlett Johannsen as Sister Clodagh writhing on the ground in a passionate embrace with George Clooney as Mr Dean whilst mad Sister Ruth played by Jessica Alba flagellates herself naked.Be careful, a UK studio like Ealing might remake 'Casablanca' starring Hugh Grant. You have been warned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Visionary Director Courageously Reinterprets a Classic Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Visionary director Neil LaBute has fashioned a motion picture that is not a remake but a beautifully realized personal interpretation of the original source material. Sensitively observed and carefully crafted, this is a film that is breathtaking in its imagery and quite disturbing in its haunting surrealism. An outstanding cast is uniformly excellent and the characters in this story are as gripping as they are fantastical. Nicolas Cage gives one of his finest performances in a role fashioned originally by the great Edward Woodward and Cage manages to make that iconic character uniquely his own. LaBute's depiction of a sinister alien culture is accentuated by his creation of a heavy atmosphere of fear, dread, and ultimately overwhelming terror. He takes tremendous risks with his reinterpretation of the classic film and they pay off spectacularly. Courageous artistic choices and creative vision make this Wicker Man a stunning motion picture experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I would have never seen the original, or never knew it to be a remake of the 1973 original, I may have liked it. I was expecting the plot to be the exact same with only the technology used to produce the movie being different. Boy was I wrong and disappointed. For those of you who have seen the original you will understand that in this new movie the only thing that links it to the old one vaguely is a guy looking for a missing girl and ending up burned. The original took a look at Briton's pagan past and its beliefs and rituals. The guy was a Christian who thought himself "better than those heathens". He had no fatherly link to the missing girl and was rather disrespectful to the people as only a Christian can be. This new movie is just an excuse to watch a famous guy punch a woman. In the original movie men and women were equal as they are in most British pagan beliefs. The God and Goddess are respected evenly. In the new movie there is something about this woman being a queen bee. Honestly I think this movie was just a bunch of filler for a twisting plot. I am so disappointed.</fullReview>

Lines were delivered with no life at all to them. There were too many throw-away characters (Cage's cop buddies at the beginning, whose roles, I would assume, were to provide some kind of background for Cage's character).It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it ranks right up there with the worst. Heck, The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra was 10 times better than this movie - at least you knew going in to the Skeleton movie that it was supposed to be bad!</fullReview>

Once you have taken away the religious, sexual, horrific plot, the fabulous acting of the pious and determined lead role and (most disappointing of all) the famous speech of the final scene, then you have truly ruined what could have been a wonderful film. How can a studio take such a great original and make it into this boring (yes boring) nonsensical load of old tosh? There are some nice individual performances here but with the story now so thin it doesn't really make up for it.

		<fullReview>The Wicker Man seemed like a good choice when I was trying to decide which movie to go to yesterday. It looked mysterious and slightly spooky, which I tend to like. So I bought tickets for my husband and myself. What a mistake. The Wicker Man really did have the potential to be good. But it's not. It's not spooky or mysterious either. It's BORING. It was obvious how the movie was going to end within the first ten minutes. I should have left the theater then. I didn't find the movie to be offensive at all. I am familiar with the Druid ceremonies of millennia past, and kind of expected the ending. However, my husband is not familiar with the legends, and he STILL knew what was going to happen. It was so boring that my husband actually fell asleep in the theater, which he has never done before. I looked around and saw several other people snoozing as well. That's two hours of my life that I'll never get back. Total waste of time and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rarely comment on a board like this. Few movies are worthy of true scorn, and the ones that merit praise have other posts that cover their successes.This movie merits scorn. Heaps of it.There isn't much need to give away the plot. There isn't much to give away, this movie could have been 45 minutes shorter and it still would have dragged. Suffice to say, Neil LaBute has no idea how to direct a suspense or horror movie. Much less how to write either genre. Cage tries to do his part, but he is given little to work with. As for the ending, it's so bad it beggars description. If this is LaBute's take on feminism, I'll take Sigourney Weaver's (Alien series) and Joss Whedon's any day.Save your money, and two hours that you'd waste on this remake. If you want to see a horror film with a pagan/naturalistic bent, rent "Lair of the White Worm". If you want a girl powered scary movie, try "The Descent". The spelunkers in the latter and Amanda Donohoe in the former are worth the price of admission.Before you pay $9 for this, rent almost any "CSI". Grissom, Warrick, Catherine, Nick and Sara are a helluva lot better than this "Wicker Man".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is absolutely the worst movie in 2006. How Nicolas Cage got talked into this is a mystery. It's not like he needed the money. And, it will only hurt his next offer. He must have owed someone big. Wow!The original 1973 version is a wonderful B movie, a sort of film-noir horror/mystery. So I was excited to hear about this new version. I wondered what kind of twists and turns they might throw in. But, it was such a let-down. It was obvious from the start where this train-wreck was going. I even saw people walk out about 5 minutes before the end. I guess they figured they had seen enough. I was thinking the same thing about 30 minutes before that but I was with some people so I just sat and bared it. The acting was passable. The plot wasn't bad. The special effects were even OK. But the dialog was so stupid it was funny. The script was so obvious as to be mind numbing. And the flashbacks were just confusing and not needed. My God! What is happening to Hollywood? They keep churning out these crappy remakes without a thought in the world about quality.If you like the idea for this movie then go rent the 1973 version, you won't be disappointed. But this remake should be removed from the theaters and burned, perhaps with some kind of ritual to keep them from making a sequel! You know it's coming!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For years and years I had no trouble answering the question "What's the worst film you've ever seen?". The answer gave me no trouble what-so-ever, why it's the "Wicker man". It's completely unconvincing and is in addition handicapped with the most incompetent and wooden actor of all time Edward Woodward. But time moves on folks a new champion steps up to the line - the remake of "The Wicker Man" not possible? Oh it's possible. Even worse than the original and with an even worse leading actor! What more wooden than Edward Woodward? Yes folks take a bow Nicolas Cage! Why is it that we continue with these lame remakes of films best fogotten? One can surmise that an honest attempt to improve the original was what motivated the makers. In this case it surely must have been possible to make an improved version but in my opinion this is a miserable failure, and actually worse than a very poor original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please sacrifice this crap remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christopher Lee would be spinning in his grave. Yes, i know hes not dead but i think a screening of this travesty of a remake could kill him. Hollywood has done it again.They have taken what many, including myself, think is one of the greatest movies to come out of the British isles and taken a giant star spangled bannered crap all over it. Why did they bother, they left out everything that made the original work including the acting, which was so bad i think they stopped bothering halfway though. To be fair Nicolas Cage did try but the script was so bad that he never stood a chance. But the rest of the cast including Kate Beahan,Ellen Burstyn, Molly Parker and Leelee Sobieski didn't even bother. To End my passionate review i can only say this. If you hated the uniquely storylined, Beautifully scripted, Wonderfully acted, musically innovated 1973 directors cut of the wicker man. Well you should love the shallow, boring,sanitised, farcically scripted, badly acted, remake. I personally will be building a wicker man in director, screenwriter Neil LaBute's garden. I THINK THAT SAYS IT ALL!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would sooner endure hour upon hour of "A Clockwork Orange" style torture; forced to watch soap operas and cat food commercials until my eyeballs bleed, before I would ever watch this movie again.The acting was stiff and tired, and there were plot holes big enough to drive a semi through. The end result was an unintentionally funny, flat, sad excuse for a suspense/thriller.I can't believe so many talented actors would subject themselves to this.Spend your money to support better films, and they'll stop making this crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm writing this review in the hope that I might save someone else from seeing this movie.I love suspense, and I love Nic Cage. I also like schlok and cheese. The Wicker Man missed on every count. It's not bad, it's horrible. It's not interesting, but rather tedious, boring and insufferable. It's not so-bad-it's-good, it's just so-so-so bad. Oh, and it's long. At least 40 minutes could be excised and the "plot" would not suffer because there is no plot. Really. It's not frightening, it's not suspenseful, it's stupid. And the script is woeful.Leaving the theatre last night, I stopped in the lobby and yelled for people not to see it. My date was mortified, but I feel a sense of duty to warn folks away from this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really hate coming home from a movie and feeling like I wished I hadn't gone. I can usually find something at least entertaining in many movies, but The Wicker Man isn't one of them. From terrible acting, to a boring story line, it's an event best missed.I was fairly excited to see the movie based on my knowledge of the story, and from the trailers. It's unfortunate, though, that you truly see the best parts of the story in the 60 second trailers. Save yourself the money and just watch it from the Apple trailer site.The film was chock full of too many events you could simply predict the outcome of. Too many turns, statements, "he's gonna get himself locked in there" type of things.Yes, it was that bad - and apparently Nick Cage forgot he can act.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>oh that ending...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't very interested in checking out the new version of "The Wicker Man" because the preview left me cold, pretty much a few of these year's blockbusters did, but I went in and couldn't force my eyes off the screen. The film is hypnotic and grabs you until its very disappointing conclusion. It's somehow what one expects, but the final piece somehow lands with something of a thud.Everyone in the film is relatively good. Ellen Burstyn never makes a false move in a role that could have been quite cheesy. She recreates a character and makes it mysterious, intelligent, almost Machiavellian and walks away with another triumph. Nicholas Cage does wonders with a part that it's overburdened by some stupid dialog, and expressions like "Step away from that bicycle...", no comments here.The music and photography complement this production that dares to explore worlds that were left behind with the 70's, and the results are spooky for the most part. Sadly, the ending is to be kind, weak. I'd say go and enjoy what it's there, and let's hope the next time, this one works again.</fullReview>

It is an awful movie. Do not wast your time. Do not wast your money. For thirty three years The Wicker man (1973) was the worst horror movie ever. So they had to make something worst.

		<fullReview>As has been mentioned here numerous times, as a horror movie, "The Wicker Man" (2006) is absolutely horrible. Easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. As a comedy, however...Nicolas Cage is pure gold! Somewhere along the movie, it seemed like Cage stopped taking it seriously, and amped up the camp factor to about 11. All of a sudden, he's questioning about a burned doll, beating up women, dressing up as a bear...beating up more women, and then, of course...the hilarity during the sacrifice. "NOT THE BEES!" As a horror movie, I can only give it 1 star out of 10, but it gets a bonus 5 stars for Nicolas Cage hamming it up in the worst way...the only way to handle a piece of turd like this. My total score: 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a fan of Nick Cage, I have to say I'm utterly disappointed in the outcome of this movie. The writers of this script (if it can be called that) is so far from the original that I could hardly bear to watch.I'm pretty sure Nick did the best he could under the circumstances, but with writers and directors of this magnitude of stupidity, it's understandable that the entire movie was sub-par.If I had to sum up the movie in a few short words, I'd tell you that I'd be reluctant to use their so called "script" as secondary toilet paper.Waste your time if you'd like, but don't be surprised when you walk away saying, "What the hell was that?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They Didn't Have a Clue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whoever was responsible for this abomination didn't have the slightest idea what the original film was about. The original was an intelligent study of the tension between ancient Pagan and Christian values, done with wit and irony. This remake is a laughable travesty written by somebody who knows absolutely nothing about either Christianity OR Paganism. Every key concept in the original is missing, or garbled. The most important aspect of the pagan culture (that it delights in nature and sex, and is joyous and festive --- beautifully portrayed in the movie) is completely absent. The pagans are portrayed as grim, shuffling fanatics, instead. In the original, the point is that the policeman, while he is stiffly pious and puritanical, nevertheless faces his martyrdom bravely, sincere in his faith. You are supposed to laugh at him in the beginning, but slowly come to respect him in the end. All of this was completely over the heads of the nitwits who made this remake. How could this have even gotten off the ground as a project? The real horror is that a classic film has been remade by complete idiots. For that kind of sacrilege, it would be nice if human sacrifice was still an option.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Disappointment - SPOILER ALERT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie started out really well, but it was totally ruined by the ending. When the movie was over, all I could think was "WHAT"????? Without giving away too much, the morbid ending seemed totally out of place with the rest of the film. So much of it was unnecessary and didn't even make sense. To sum it up, I would have to say it was definitely "overkill". Other than what I consider to be a very poor ending, parts of the movie were actually riveting, although there were too many inconsistencies. I found myself wondering how these women could second guess so many things and know exactly how the Nicolas Cage character would react. This movie was a real waste of good talent. Don't waste your time or money on this one.</fullReview>

Dear movie creators, please stop making horrible films. I would love to give you spoilers of why this film is bad, but to see the true horror that is this crap, you have to watch it. Save yourself some money and do not see this film. I like Nic Cage as an actor but he must have been desperate for roles when this was offered. The film is just really really really bad.

Without revealing the plot, all I can say is that this is another let-down movie. The only emotions I have after seeing it, are frustration, and lots of anger, and not for good reasons, just for time and money lost. I thought it would be a mystery type paranormal thing, what a disappointment!, is just a fiasco with very bad taste.

		<fullReview>OK. I like Nicholas Cage, but this was not a good job move for him! The movie was slower than molasses in January and it just made me leave feeling like I should have seen Gridiron gang with my husband! First of all, once he gets to the island, the rude people ask how he got there and they assumed the pilot, so you knew the pilot was gonna get killed, and he did.Secondly, nobody would give him straight answers throughout the whole movie which would leave one to assume he was stupid for not beating it out of them! Then, they burn him at the end? Hello? Not to mention the little "parade" of weirdo women romping about the countryside dressed up in masquerade attire. It was corny! And Lelee Sobieski? She should have stayed home for the filming. Her character gave absolutely nothing to the movie and when she tries to attack him, a shovel to his head would have worked, but she jumps on him and screams. Um, he's a cop, with training.The acting was pretty much a loss, even for Nick and the only thing that made the movie was the beautiful scenery. Otherwise it stunk and made me mad that I wasted my time. I don't usually write comments like this, but it was an awful movie! It wasn't scary or suspenseful as it was made out to be in the reviews and with the exception of Nicks 1 "F" word usage, could have been PG.Oh, well, that's what I get for not having cable TV or getting the paper delivered to read the critics reviews first!

		<fullReview>The Wicker Man "2006" is a strange movie and not in the way the 73 version was strange. I'm sure on paper the whole thing sounded great. Giving the film a hyper feminine twist and make it more accessible by casting a big star and throwing in some punch lines. It must have also sounded great to have this remake directed by Neil Labute famous for his films that have strong female leads and feature the dissection of men. But on screen it just doesn't work. It's no surprise that Labute has no experience in the genre and it's just a one of the films many problems. Cage stars as Edward Malace a highway cop who supposedly becomes involved with a horrific accident that claims the lives of a young girl and her mother. While on leave he gets a letter from his ex fiancée bidding him to come and help her find her daughter who has gone missing. Against the advice of his friends he travels to the mysterious island filled with people who worship gods and goddesses, make sacrifices to ensure a good harvest and dress up as animals. He pokes around the island a bit, and everyone is fitfully weird until that dreaded, somewhat disturbing but clichéd conclusion. This version of that classically creepy film is strange for the fact that it tries so hard to be strange while remaining mainstream. It has the oddball dancing, disturbing imagery, weird dialogue and cultish festivities but it lacks being involving. And in a film like this it must be involving otherwise it comes off as being unintentionally funny. Which it is, it's a laugh riot. there is not one genuinely creepy or suspenseful sequence within the entire film. All the characters are one dimensional giving questionable performances. And the plots pacing and direction give one pause when assuming the films credibility. The biggest thrills come from Cage knocking out women and jump kicking them in the faces. The 3 things this film has to offer are (1) gorgeous cinematography, (2) a creepy if slightly under developed performance by Ellen Burstyn and (3) a reminder that Cage is an attractive man. Even in his older years he still retains his hard physique and chisseled face. He is always the hero, the good guy, succeeding to a fault. Besides the direction, pacing performances and screenplay what the films ultimate problem is , is that just tries too hard. If a film is weird, it's just weird. You can't try to be weird it comes off as fake. And everyone associated with this project from Labute to Cage to Sobeski is just not weird. There is no doubt that talent went into this film, but talent doesn't guarantee a good movie. And with a little less tampering and a lot more originality this could have been a truly compelling take on the original. What remains is an unintentionally funny, wannabe weirdo flick...and thats not really very appealing to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only thing more upsetting than the horrible mis-marketing of The Wickerman is the audience's complicity in going along with it. I'm instantly reminded of another movie called Hellcab. Everything about it sucks but the movie itself. The title. The box. The tagline: "Do you dare to pay the fare?" But again, the movie itself ? very good. Go rent it.Here lies the problem: Not every film fits into a nice, little box. Not every film can be summed up. Drama. Horror. Comedy. Romance. Some films walk the line. Other's eschew it altogether. Such is the case with The Wickerman. A strange, almost Lynchian film about a man who receives a letter from a long lost love begging his help in recovering her missing daughter. Sound like an interesting premise? It is. He goes to the island and is confronted by a strange matriarchal society of strong women and mute men and searches for the girl who everyone else claims either never existed or is dead. The mystery doubles upon itself as he suffers hallucinations, vivid nightmares, and scorn from the estrogen empowered populace. Anyone familiar with Labute's previous work will understand and revel in the battle-of-the-sexes subtext. What it means exactly is up to the viewer to decide. Women are evil? Men are being castrated by an increasingly PC society? Pick your poison and drink it. Because ultimately what we have here is not the dime-a-dozen horror flick the studio machine seems to want us to think it is. Instead Labute and company have crafted an enjoyably creepy, diabolically clever forum for debate while keeping tongue firmly planted in cheek and never losing track of their source material.This is a movie highly recommended for thinking viewers and those looking for something more than a few forgettable scares.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible, Shameful and Unnecessary Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While recovering from a tragic accident on the road, the patrolman Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) receives a letter from his former fiancée Willow (Kate Beahan), who left him years ago without any explanation, telling that her daughter Rowan is missing. Edward travels to the private island of Summerisle, where Willow lives in an odd community that plant fruits, and she reveals that Rowan is actually their daughter. Along his investigation with the hostile and unhelpful dwellers, Edward discloses that the locals are pagans, practicing old rituals to improve their harvest, and Rowan is probably alive and being prepared to be sacrificed. When he locates the girl, he finds also the dark truth about the wicker man.The original "The Wicker Man" of 1973 is a simple and original dark story with a surprising end that hooks the attention of the viewer until the very last scene. This unnecessary remake is terrible and shameful, and Neil LaBute spoiled the magnificent 1973 screenplay. First, Nicolas Cage is unrecognizable, histrionic, performing an unpleasant and abusive character, punching women, interrupting a class without any education and so on. There are many ridiculous scenes, like for example with Edward Malus digging a grave or diving into the water wearing shirt, tie and jacket. The good cast is wasted in a laughable and boring flick, actually an insult to the wonderful British film. In my opinion, it is better off watching again the original movie and forgets this silly remake. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "O Sacrifício" ("The Sacrifice")</fullReview>

There was actually no need to make this at all the original was made in the 70s and it suits the 70s, very weird and VERY DIFFERENT but this remake it really just turned it in to a stupid horror mystery, the legendary Christopher Lee replaced by Ellen Burstyn (nothing against her) its just why????? they also stuck in a cruddy back story about a "iffy" car crash. Acting is so-so Cage isn't that bad(!) whilst everyone else sort of floated around in the background doing nothing. Whilst the stupid love story added some boring sub-plot. Hey and is it just Cage are can we all survive being in cold water for over 12 hours and still manage to smash down the doors of most of the houses, and trail through the woods. Hey they still managed to fit some of the new horror and mystery movie films classic dialogue "something bad is gonna happen, i can feel it" SNOR! The ending had NO shock value what-so ever, in the original it generally scared me. this i laughed (terrible i know) but it was just so bad. But generally this is just a bad, stupid and OTT remake. I really don't recommend it. Sit down and watch the original far more enjoyable!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautifully visualised with some excellent sequences and a strong central performance from Cage, this new 'Wicker Man' deserves much credit for rethinking and reworking the original rather than just regurgitating it like the recent remake of 'The Omen'. Be warned though that many of this film's better sequences are in its trailer and you will enjoy it much more if you haven't seen the trailer. There are also loose ends, and things that don't tie up properly, which leave the viewer feeling slightly cheated. But the overall conception is wonderfully creepy with the Paganism of the original being given a feminist spin which ties in with the theme of 'The Da Vinci Code' Given the fact 'The Wicker Man' is a hard film to remake, this has enough originality and power of its own both to reward fans of the first and engage those who never saw it.Given the slightly hostile reception to this movie and one extraordinarily unfair and grossly inaccurate review in 'Variety' I'd like to add a few words to the above. The film is being condemned firstly by fans of the original, secondly by people who hate this kind of film anyway. The two types are very different but have merged into an unholy chorus (fuelled by beefs about the soundtrack which are a complete red herring). If only they had done this for the vastly inferior 'Omen' remake which really was a lazy and cynical disgrace. By contrast here enormous care has been taken to rework the story from scratch. None of the detractors are giving any credit at all to the film's first half which is entirely different from the earlier film and intelligently so.Indeed the reviewer in Variety appears to have forgotten the plot of the first 'Wicker Man' altogether for he seems to think no changes have been made of any substance! Let me remind him that in the first film the hero was just a dogged ordinary policeman doing his somewhat routine duty. Here Cage is a man returning to find a lost love and his own lost child after an electrifying and very strange opening involving a horrifying encounter with a woman and child who are killed before his eyes. The brutal fact is, Variety, that up to the halfway point this is a completely different movie from what we last saw and in some ways an improvement.It's true of course that at the climax, the film does revert, in my view rather misguidedly, to the original. I think it would have been far better to evolve a different ending for this very different story. In the first film there was a sense that the narrow-minded hero was bound to meet his end, it was his destiny. Here in contrast it just seems unfair and somewhat arbitrary and not even entirely credible. For the the hero of this film, who has no blinkers, would have seen it coming and acted accordngly. I would submit that here is the reason people are so upset by the film. "An audience will forgive you anything at the beginning of the film and nothing at the end" as Hithcock observed. That is unfair but not entirely surprising. What is surprising is that because of the similarity of the climax few seem to have noticed just how different this film is from its model or paid any attention to its more original elements. And even more that a usually accurate journal of movie record could come up with such a slipshod review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disappointing to say the least</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been wanting to see this movie since I saw the first preview. I watched it New Year's eve night. I expected it to be great. It wasn't even good. The whole thing was confusing. I was waiting for it to come together and it never does. When the movie was over...I couldn't believe it. I was sure I missed something. On the DVD I rented, there were two different endings, one on each side. I watched them both. They didn't differ much and neither one made sense. The preview for this movie does not portray what the actual movie was like. I was very disappointed. I am glad that I did not go see it at the theater. I would not recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Could film makers be any more inaccurate about Scottish history and culture? Wicker Man plot is complete garbage. The roman, Greek, and English propaganda of human sacrifice and barbarianism among their conquests have long been tossed aside by scholars. Do we really need a remake with Nicolas Cage breeding more prejudice? Oh well, the wicker man prop was truly cool. We didn't expect much from a horror novel, anyway. Now we have Braveheart. Mel Gibson is just an idiot. Not only did he have his stories and characters all wrong, but the costuming and weapons covered several eras at once. Nobody wore woad to fight in those times. French princesses were butt ugly in all the illustrations I've seen! The casting was terrible but at least the wild Gaelic hair looked real. The whole "freedom" thing was inspiring, the natural scenery was breath-taking, and they get points for filming in the rain. Rob Roy was probably the closest, but still not an exceptionally realistic depiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How did it burn?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"How did it burn" being the best and most memorable part of the movie. Cage's character Edward repeatedly screams it without giving Willow (Beahan) a chance to answer. My friends and I laughed and poked fun at it, just like several other parts of the movie.I'm prone to seeing bad movies. I saw Napoleon Dynamite. I saw Cold Creek Manor. I saw Lady in the Water (which I found to be not as bad as the reviews claim it is). I'd rank this above Lady in the Water but below CCM and Napoleon on the "Crappy movie" scale.First off, let's review some of the hilarity of the movie. Cage's character is apparently a druggie or something because at one point in the movie he took several pills. Those could be for his bee allergy, but drugs could easily explain his ridiculously stupid behavior throughout the movie. He sees things constantly (such as the girl that he's searching for getting hit by a truck while he's on a ship), and that would only make sense if he was either a drug addict or was mentally unstable. Another memorable (read: hilarious) part of the movie is where Edward finds the mutilated body of the pilot that was his only way out of here; his eyes ripped out and his mouth sewn shut, along with one of his hands missing. Edward immediately begins shaking the corpse as if trying to get him to "wake up." I don't think he's going to wake up now, Eddy.And then there's the ending. I didn't see this coming. Nor did I want it to happen. Sure, it's a different angle to have the main character sacrificed. It happened in The Skeleton Key (albeit the main character survived in a new body), but this time around he didn't survive. Quite the contrary; the movie draws to a close with Edward's tortured screams echoing across the theater as he burns to death. I don't like it when my protagonist dies. Especially something as horrible as being BURNT.Alright, so that's all. It had a confusing but okay plot that had several unintentionally hilarious scenes and a disturbing and disappointing ending. I haven't seen the original Wicker Man, and I doubt that the main character lives in that one. So yeah. That's my review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny in surprising ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never would've seen this film if Neil LaBute's name wasn't attached to it. I appreciate some of his earlier films, such as "In the Company of Men" and "Your Friends and Neighbors." "The Wicker Man" is nothing like those movies, except perhaps in that it reveals the director's understated sense of humor.I read some nutshell reviews of this film on RottenTomatoes after I had already seen it, and one of them caught my eye. It said that the result of the film was unintentionally hilarious. I agree that it was hilarious, but I certainly think LaBute appreciated the humor. For example, when Nicholas Cage was storming around the island, near the film's climax, kicking down doors, waving his gun around, beating up weird pagan women, and very much acting the part of Bruce Willis in "Die Hard", I couldn't help but laugh. His approach is just so unsubtle and inappropriate for the situation that I suspected his efforts would be futile.In the end, when Cage burns alive, LaBute might show us a lot of gore if this were a horror film. He doesn't, and it isn't. The epilogue left me smiling. I like how effortless it is for the two women in the bar. They just walk in, sit down, and immediately two men fall into their trap and their fate is sealed. The women hardly have to say a word because the men are eager to pursue them. I reckon this is a bit of observational humor from LaBute.I find the whole idea of this island of evil women who enslave and murder men to be a bit of irony on LaBute's part. He is not showing us how things are--rather, he is showing us the extreme opposite, in part at least, I am sure, for comic effect. Some viewers, I have no doubt, will find the film sexist. They will have mistaken its tone(which is rather inconsistent, and probably contributed to my opinion that this film is only slightly above average of stuff I see).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, the horror..........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lets face it; it was all destined to end in tears. And, as optimistic as we all tried to be, the very idea of remaking The Wicker Man was never a good one. What truly floors me, however, is that in remaking a contemporary British chiller, the producers thought it would be a a good idea to cast an American action stay in the lead role. Is this a joke? Nocholas Cage was good in Face/Off, Con Air and the like. But Jesus, stick to what you know, man! Because at the end of the day, you are not the best actor in the world.And, whilst in the original film, the lead character was a devoutly religious, unmarried virgin, in this film he is allergic to bees. Allergic. To. Bees. Wow. Thats much better. Seriously, the only thing that kept me from bursting into tears and rolling up into a foetal position on the floor was the unintentional comedy; did they honestly think people would be able to take the sight of Nicholas Cage roundhouse kicking little old ladies seriously?? Or forcing them off their bicycles at gunpoint? And whilst some might praise director/hack extraordinaire Neil LaBute for at least having the balls to keep the original ending intact, i found it simply staggering that his incompetence is of such a grand scale that he couldn't even make the sight of Nicholas Cage being burnt alive look satisfying.But in all seriousness, this film was destined to crash and burn. the plot (which has been "cleverly updated" to include the idea that the little girl who goes missing is actually his daughter) is far too out there to find acceptance amongst a mainstream audience, whilst fans of the original, and, lets face it, fans of common decency in general, will probably avoid this like a plague. I, meanwhile, am simply floored that they ever dared to attempt this in the first place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is a disgrace to my religion!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I myself am pagan, i just finished watching "The Wicker Man" and found it at most a disgrace to my religion. The religion portrayed here is satanic and cruel. Pagan is a religion based on balance and peace, not killing some innocent man and goats just because your crops failed. According to the Pagan Reed (our bible) "An it harm none, do what ye will". In this movie they harm and kill a character to get what they want. According to the pagan balance if that were real life they not only are worshiping the devil (NOT Goddess) by harming someone but they would get it back three fold. For Murder, I don't even want to think about would happen to them.Also if the director or and associate ever reads this: toward the end where they chant "The Crone must die". Get your facts straight! If the crone had to die it would be "Sister Summersile not the man. The Crone is the wise one, also known as a grandmother. Next time you make a movie pertaining to this particular religion. Research what your doing because I can guarantee you've angered not only me but other pagan's as well. After watching this movie I can only hope my friends (whom are not of the pagan faith) don't think this is what my religion is really about.</fullReview>

I don't agree with the majority of shuns of this film and reason may be that I have not had the opportunity to see the original film...so I have nothing to compare it to. I was amazed at Nicolas Cage's portrayal of Edward Malus and also the pagan people of Summersisle. The movie confused the hell out me and I found myself trying to grasp and infer all the information I could because I was trying to understand exactly what this movie was about. I felt that I could not quite comprehend until it finally ended. And then I still didn't understand. The reason being was because I did not understand why the community created this elaborate plan to lure and deceive a man who knew nothing of them, that his ex fiancée would allow their daughter(allegedly) to set him afire, why the townspeople sat there and watched a man burn to death. Essentially this is what makes the movie a must see for anyone despite the reviews. It allows you to think for yourself and in the end what you thought is not what is reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wicker Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original British film starring Edward Woodward and Sir Christopher Lee is a great cult classic, and naturally there came a remake by the Americans, from director Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men, Nurse Betty). Basically Edward Malus (Razzie nominated Nicolas Cage) is recovering after watching a mother and his daughter killed in a car accident, when he receives a letter from ex-fiancée Willow Woodward (Flightplan's Kate Beahan). She left him years ago, without explanation, and now she needs him, as a police officer, to help find her missing daughter Rowan (Erika-Shaye Gair), on the private and remote island of Summerisle. He explores the island of very strange people, led by Sister Summerisle (The Exorcist's Ellen Burstyn), who grow plants and keep bees for honey, and Willow reveals that Rowan isn't just her daughter, but also his. He is slowly realising that the island is overrun with women in a pagan cult, practising old rituals and preparing for some big Godforsaking celebration to improve the harvest, and sacrifice a helpless victim. He is convinced that they are all lying about the whereabouts and state of Rowan in order to kill her, but when he does eventually find her, that is when he finds out the terrifying truth. They are all in on it, including Rowan, and they are in fact going to sacrifice Edward, first breaking both his legs, stinging him with bees causing his allergic reaction, and trapping him in the wicker man to be burned alive. Also starring Frances Conroy as Dr. T.H. Moss, Molly Parker as Sister Rose / Sister Thorn, Leelee Sobieski as Sister Honey and Diane Delano as Sister Beech. Whereas the cult pagan rituals and insanity are the original film's strength, here it is one of the biggest weaknesses, it would be much more believable with Cage's character being religious like the great Woodward was. The action has been too hyped up for its own good, the mystery and menace has been dulled till the finale, and the wicker man burns much too quickly for my liking. I don't mind Cage and Burstyn too much, and tiny that don't exist in the original add tension, but all in all it was a pretty awful experience, and if you have any sense, just stick with the much more influential and superior original. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Remake or Rip-Off, Worst Screen Couple for Cage and his bear suit and Worst Screenplay. Pretty poor!</fullReview>

Nicolas Cage is, in my opinion, a relatively bland actor, but the intensity and attention to detail throughout the rest of the movie makes up for that.

The soundtrack, which I also bought, is creative and suspenseful. The script isn't that great but the directing makes up for it. Nicolas Cage and Ellen Burstyn did great acting in this movie. I really don't understand why many people make fun of this movie. It's about time someone made a good horror/mystery that's not about blood and guts.Please don't judge this movie from its reviews! I beg you to watch it and decide for yourself!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well made - but disturbing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretty good - but disturbing and yucko ending. I really don't have much more to say about this movie - I never saw the original and don't want to after seeing this one. It was well-made and great acting by Nicolas Cage.For some bizarre reason, I'm not allowed to make a simple 2 or 3 line comment. No...IMDb demands at least 10 lines, so now I'm trying to fill space so my comment will be accepted. So I think I'm getting close to line 10 now -- therefore after this sentence I'll stop typing. Oops...still didn't take, so I'll now type 1 more line of ridiculous text to meet the all-important 10-line minimum.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most fanatics of the original seem to be having a difficult time seeing how good this movie is. I prefer it to the original which seems to have been made for college pot-heads. This remake was more clear. The acting was great, as was the setting. The humor was in fact intentional. The ending was amazing, much like the original only without a bunch of drunken B-list actors singing some goofy song.I think (in fact I know from the reaction of people I was with in the theater) that people who have never seen the original -- and that's a lot of people -- will enjoy this very interesting and beautifully made movie. Thank you for making this much needed remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Completely unexpecting and terrifying, The Wickerman is a must see. I saw this movie last weekend and found the movie a lot better than expected. Nicholas Cage performed magnificently to pull off the sick twist to the story.Unlike the original movie that took place on a remote mysterious Scottish island, this movie brought to life a sheltered community in the Puget Sound off the Washington coast.Based on old 70's flick, a story written by Anthony Shaffer, Neil LaBute (producer) brought back this horror to big screen with a thrilling 21st century roller-coaster bang.Here's a quick synopsis: The main character goes on a journey to investigate the disappearance of a young girl. He discovers that the locals are weird and unhelpful, and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the disappearance.Loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing this movie I didn't know anything about the original Wicker Man movie, I even expected a whole different movie after what I had seen in the trailers shown in The Netherlands.After watching the movie, at first I was a little disappointed..Cage isn't performing like he has shown before in other movies and from time to time that results in some strange moments. Now, a day later, all I can say is that the movie left an impression --&gt; the ending kept me interested, even so much that I started reading online about the original movie, which I'll probably see as well. The sinister feeling at the end is priceless. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't ever seen the original movie out of 1973. And from those who have seen it: give it a try, it's really not so bad as everyone makes it sound...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As always Cage puts on an excellent performance which really holds the movie together. Unlike the original wicker ma it does not contain the the religious element of the main character but only of the inhabitants of the island. A tad bit repetitive but on the whole a captivating 2 hours with brilliant performances from the majority of actors and a shocking twist at the end if your watching it for the first time. Basically it is about a group of bizarre pagan inhabitants on an island who have strange sexual rituals. When a girl goes missing on the island, cage, who is a cop in the movie, is called in by his former lover (whos girl it is), to investigate. Arriving on this island he observes the strange behaviour of its people and slowly unfolds a spine-tingling plot.</fullReview>
