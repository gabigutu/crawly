		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Speeding along a lonely stretch of highway outside the city limits of Vancouver Canada architect Vincent Eastman, Richard Gere, reaches an intersection on the road as well as in his life as his car swerves to avoid a stalled van and goes tumbling down an embankment. Vincent's life goes flashing before his eyes as he as well as us in the audience see the events over the last few years that lead to what just happened to him.Married to his boss' daughter Vincent went far in his father-in-laws building business but his marriage to Sally, Sharon Stone,had cooled off over the years. Being estranged from Sally yet working in the same office with her made life almost impossible for Vincent to take. Knowing that Sally was living with Richard, David Selby, and having Richard spend more time with his thirteen year old daughter Meaghan, Jennifer Morrison, then he did didn't make things better for him either. Having an affair with magazine columnist Olivia Marshak, Lolita Davidovich, was also taking a toll on Vincent's life since he couldn't complain about Sally's affair with Richard which really disturbed Vincent to the point of almost being physically violent towards him. With a lot of thought and anguish Vincent painfully came to a final conclusion on what his decision on who to be with, Sally or Olivia, and puts it on paper. Out in the country as Vincent was about to mail the letter to the women who he was going to spend the rest of his life with something strangely happened to him. Like a preordained vision that was conjured up for Vincent by destiny he saw who the woman in his life was to be and knew now what to do with his life and who to spend it with. Is was then that fate unexpectedly intervened and made it all right for everyone involved, Vincent Sally &amp; Olivia, but sadly at the expense of Vincent's life. Haunting eerie and original love story that, despite it's slow pace, will really move you like it did me and many of the reviewers on the IMDb in the end. Richard Gere is both sensitive and explosive as the emotionally drained Vincent who has to make up his mind, to keep from losing it, between Sally and Olivia but who has his decision made up for him by circumstances beyond and far out of his control. Sharon Stone gives one of her best performances ever as Sally Eastman Vincent's estranged wife. Sally in the end somewhat realizes the truth about Vincent's feelings for her but, touchingly so, keeps it to herself as well as from Olivia. And Lolita Davidovich is both sexy and caring as Vincent's lover Olivia. Who unknown to Sally knows what Vincent really felt about her after he wrote, what turned out to be, his last will and testament which Sally quietly ripped up and threw down a storm drain as the movie ended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a consummate and long-time fan of Richard Gere's, this was a 'must have' for me and the acquisition was not a disappointment. As usual, Richard gave an excellent performance, for which I am never disappointed. Sharon Stone and Lolita Davidovich were great choices for the female characters and effectively displayed the contrast between the personalities of the women. This movie contained real aspects to a person's dilemma's in relationships...from a sterile, business 'association' with his first wife to a passionate and truly loving 'real-life' affair with the woman he met in a chance encounter. The drama of the accident was well done and suspenseful. In the end, the most touching aspect was that neither woman wished to hurt the other by disclosing what they each believed to be true - both were loved and wanted. I enjoyed it very much and it is a much-watched movie in my home with all actors performing excellently. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a love story which is true to real-life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This unpopular film showcases wonderfully nuanced performances that flesh out a simple story with an interesting twist. Multiple flashbacks (or shifting timescape) delineate the story, making for a complex movie, but the patient viewer is rewarded in the end.Richard Gere, Sharon Stone, and Lolita Davidovich breathe life into the three corners of a love triangle. Stone is especially good as the calculating Sally, whose formidable personality holds together only at the fast pace of high-end social and professional success. Gere manifests the ambiguity of a man who must choose not only between women but between parts of his soul. Spirited Davidovich is very appealing as a vital woman deeply connected to fundamental contentedness and freedom.Some philosophy is in order when considering this intimate, thoughtful film. It portrays various aspects of the human condition without embodying them. For instance, Richard Gere plays a man in the grip of profound indecision, but director Mark Rydell's hand is sure and his intent clear (`Whatever you're going to do, do it!'). The movie compresses the many small but meaningful moments that make up a lifetime into a taut montage of images flashing before the viewer's eyes, evoking the close link between life, time, and death. It shows how the simplest, smallest gesture can trigger an epiphany of profound meaning as someone struggles to find clarity in their life. Best of all, the movie illustrates how, even in tragedy, everyone can come away with something positive worth clinging to, whether it's a message on an answering machine, a hurtful letter undelivered, or a plunge into the depths of peace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't understand the negative reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this film was quite good, not slow or dull by any means. It's as solid and entertaining as most "top rated" modern films of similar genre. Maybe a bit too subtle for some people? There seems to be a problem with shortening attention spans.There is a well controlled air of the unknown through the whole thing. The rain-soaked scenery is compelling, the acting is realistic and the final sequence is powerfully done. You never quite know what's going to happen, which to me makes a good film.Did it get bad press before it was even released? I think people sometimes go in with a bias that has no explanation. Theaters themselves can spoil movies by way of unruly viewers and other distractions. Just going to the wrong place on the wrong night can give a movie a bad rep. Get a big screen TV or projector and tune all that out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not quite sure what this movie's about. I'm not saying that I suspect that I missed some deep, subtle secret concealed within the narrative that only a select few will ever grasp (this, I assume, is true of the alleged comedy that I've missed in various 'comedic' films) -- rather, I'm just not entirely sure that this film delivers what it might have had it had a more coherent flow and some semblance of actually going anywhere. Not that that sentence that I just penned is a great example of those qualities, but I digress...The movie features fine performances from all involved, including Lolia Davidovich and Sharon Stone and the pretty-much-always excellent Richard Gere. Gere's character is convincing and real, but perhaps a tad too real because he's a pretty wishy-washy fellow and his is not the most compelling of roles. Then again, neither is anyone else's, really. The two female leads get marginally more to wrap their skills around, but the whole is way less than the sum of its parts. A 98-minute film, "Intersection" seems a lot longer and I found myself calculating time-elapsed and time-remaining at more than one point. Hardly a good sign. Sure, there are no Ramboesque explosions and car chases (though a high-speed driving theme is at the movie's heart) but I'm not the type of male who has to have that kind of thing to keep me engaged. A story might be nice, though. I mean, a story that hangs together. In the absence of much direction, and in the presence of multiple and confusing layers of flashback, the actors' great work is sabotaged. It just doesn't really seem to go anywhere. When the film finished I felt the sentiment echoed in that old Peggy Lee song..."Is that all there is?" And I don't like Peggy Lee, darn it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly mundane remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Intersection started with a disadvantage in that it's a remake of one of my favorite films, Les Choses de la Vie. The original uses a terrible car crash (one of the best ever filmed) as a starting point for a series of flashbacks and reflections on the turning point in an architects life, when the relationship that ended his marriage is in danger of self-destructing because of his inability to make an effort. But where the accident is that film's focal point, replayed in various different ways as a kind of inescapable destiny, in Intersection it is used almost as an afterthought to bring some resolution to a mundane soap opera about an indecisive man torn between his career-conscious wife and his more liberal lover (though I wonder if that may be last-minute re-editing into a more linear structure to 'save' the film since its original release date was pushed back).It's not a case of not giving the film a chance - there have been interesting re-workings of European films by Hollywood before - or expecting a raunchfest because of Gere or Stone's presence. It's just that it's really not very good. The result isn't exactly unwatchable, but it is overwritten, over scored and surprisingly uncinematic. Rydell gives the film plenty of gloss but few cinematic flourishes, concentrating on the seen-it-all-before romance in a way that seems more TV movie of the week than anything worth paying to see on the big screen. Sharon Stone is superb as the ex-wife and Davidovitch does well as the lover despite some unfortunate and unnecessary scenes towards the end that undermine her character to make Gere look good - which brings me to the film's major failing. Gere's character and performance. Gere can act and has done good work, but this is an especially shallow and by-the-numbers ego trip more than a performance. Aside from being the screen's most unconvincing architect (and that includes Woody Harrelson in Indecent Proposal), the smug, self, narcissistic performance here prevents us from ever caring about whether the character lives or dies. Even the film's one nearly successful scene at a post office when he can't decide whether to post an important letter is ultimately destroyed by his hammy grandstanding phone call at the end of it.Not that the script is any help. Scenes are overwritten, achingly obvious and horribly predictable, with everything spelled out in broad strokes. Ultimately you're just left wandering from predictable scene to predictable scene with little interest. Slick, watchable, forgettable, the final insult is that the novel and Claude Sautet film this misfire is based on is only acknowledged at the very, very end of the credits when no-one is likely to spot it. That said, the filmmakers are probably grateful not to be associated with this one...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Gere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Gere stars in this American-made remake of the 1970 film Les Choses de la vie of French Director Claude Sautet based on the novel by Paul Guimard. This time around Mark Rydell, who enjoyed success with On Golden Pond, Cinderella Liberty, The Rose and The Reivers among others is the director. Sharone Stone, Lolita Davidavich and Martin Landau round out the cast but this is clearly a Richard Gere film. Although I'm generally not a fan of Gere he is excellent in this. This does have the feel of a European film and although I've never seen the original I would like to. I'd likely find it better as a whole. This is a good drama and although not a big movie it has a good look to it. I would give this a 7.0 on a scale of 10 for it's likable story and performance by Richard Gere,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I actually managed to like Sharon Stone !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a vastly superior remake of a French film called "Les Choses de La Vie" by Claude Sautet starring Michel Piccoli and Romy Schneider. I had known the original film for many years because of its theme music....which is absolutely magnificent, and composed by Philippe Sarde. The film itself is really a load of slow, boring and tedious crap ........a car accident is repeated in slow motion I don't know how many times but enough to drive one mad on that score alone ! Also it was very repetitive and had little deep character development. In short, its saving grace was its soundtrack !!!Intersection, on the other hand, which I saw when it came out in Cinemas in France and subsequently bought on DVD has always been a great favorite of mine ! So much better than the Les Choses de La Vie that to compare the two is, quite frankly, a total waste of time. To be truthful, when I saw Intersection, I did not make the connection with Les Choses de La Vie, such was the greatness of Intersection compared to the banality of the other film ! It's only by reading about the film that I discovered this.From what appears to be a relatively limited plot, we have magnificent performances from the three principal actors, especially the two ladies ! Of course the red-haired Olivia Marchak was an absolute beauty, but even Sharon Stone, whom I don't usually like in films, had something attractive about her ! Gere had a weak, cowardly and annoying character ( I don't like seeing people cheat on their wives ) but I must admit he played the part very well. I was especially subdued by Olivia, both by her physical beauty and here quasi-unflappable character in what could have been tense situations.The final fifteen to twenty minutes of the film is the best part because ......you know it's going to happen .....but you don't want it to ......but it's destiny. I liked the bit about the letter he wrote to Olivia but never posted plus the message he left on Olivia's ansafone but where SHaron Stone came by accident into possession of the letter which was written but never posted. All that really got to me at the end and filled me with a strange emotion somewhere between happiness and sadness and is very difficult to describe. By this deft twist of the plot, each of the Ladies believed he loved ......her !! An excellent way to finish the film.I have watched the film four or five times and each time I am filled with the same emotion .....so there must be something there !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure what it takes to be critical of a movie like this. Maybe it's inexperience in life. SPOILERS: Maybe if you've never lost a dear love and don't know what it feels like to have your knees buckle when told they are dead, you wouldn't appreciate the emotion and acting that is conveyed in this script. Also, I never considered this to be a boring movie at all. It's a love story. It had a three tissue ending, but I don't consider that to be a downfall. Richard Gere and Sharon Stone are great. I've seen this film three times now and still think it's a strong 9 out of 10! Don't avoid it because of the negative reviews here. Give it your own scrutiny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quietly thoughtful - this movie sneaks up on you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** WARNING - CONTAINS SPOILERS *** Like many other reviewers, I have a tough time seeing how people can rate this film poorly. It's well written, well acted, and well filmed. Some jaded, adrenaline-addicted viewers might find it slow and uneventful. But in reality, the film is emotionally complex, and it reveals itself gradually, in multiple layers, requiring patience on the part of the viewer to appreciate it fully.Much has been made of how this film is about the main character Vincent's choices. The first time I watched it, that's what I thought too - and yes, I did feel a little ripped off discovering that in the end, it doesn't really matter what his choice is.That's when I realized that this film is about much more than "just" the main character. EVERYONE in the film has choices - difficult choices - to make. There's a reason for the film's name. Vincent is the intersection point of everyone around him, and this story is about how everyone else is affected by the situation just as much as it is about Vincent himself.On the first viewing, I enjoyed the film primarily for Richard Gere's haunting, understated portrayal of an emotionally tormented, burned out man struggling to navigate his way through life so that he gets what he wants and needs without hurting the people closest to him - and becoming emotionally paralyzed when he realizes that it's impossible, leading to tragic consequences.It isn't until the last scene that the film reveals its true focus. Only then does the viewer realize that the story's preoccupation with Vincent - even the accident itself, playing out in slow-motion over the course of the film - is nothing but a clever distraction, designed to divert the viewer's attention so that the final scene is even more unexpected and powerful. Stone and Davidovich both turn in brilliant performances, and their confrontation absolutely crackles with emotional tension. It took a second viewing for me to fully appreciate the depth of their performances, and see everything that leads up to that final moment. Because in the end, that's what really made this film work for me. It's not about Vincent, because his choice is rendered tragically pointless. He is merely the catalyst. The film's true focus is on the choices of Vincent's wife and mistress, and what they decide to take away from their relationships with him. The film's suspense doesn't come from Vincent's fate; it comes from knowing that Sally and Olivia both have the power to hurt each other deeply, and wondering whether or not they will choose to use that power.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie has a nice point and counterpoint about it. This movie and Gere's Unfaithful are sort of bookend pieces to each other. As Crash is to Grand Canyon. Guys will pigeon hole this as a chick flick. If you are not going to WATCH CLOSELY you will miss a lot esp towards the ending of Intersection.SPOILER hereVincent Eastman (Gere) can not seem to choose between two women. This is "what I have been doing and what those around me want me to do" versus "going after some one that will make me happy" stuff. His scene with the little red haired girl (2/3 of the way thru) is wonderful. Finally his decision is really made. On the way to his new life he reaches the intersection....The James Newton Howard score is terrific, and sadly, just try finding it anywhere! This movie and Gere's 'Unfaithful' are sort of bookend pieces to each other. As 'Crash' is to 'Grand Canyon'. Guys will pigeon hole this as a chick flick.

I've seen it at least twice, and both times it mediated a special feeling that moved me.The five main reasons why I liked this movie, are (not listed in any particular order):1. Richard Gere - He doesn't give a great performance, but hey ! It's Richard Gere, and I really like him.2. Sharon Stone - On the other hand gives a great performance. I've never seen her this good.3. James Newton Howards fantastic score. The music over the final scenes and the ending credits is so beautiful and emotional, that it can make me cry everytime that I listen to it. The score enhances and puts an emphasis on the developments in the movie in an extraordinary way.4. The script - Although it's not that tight, it's still well written, with likeable characters and a good message.5. The feeling that this movie mediates, through the above mentioned reason, and lots more.In conclusion: I recommend this film. It will probably not be the best movie you've ever seen, but well worth your time. And as I said, it has a good message.</fullReview>

However, the couple are hot for each other with a quickie love making scene and the marriage seems to drift a part. Lolita Davidovich,(Olivia Marshak), "Dark Blue",'02, catches Vincent's eye in more ways than one and things start to pick up romantically. Olivia is a reporter and seems like the perfect soul mate for Vincent and then the picture goes into many flash backs and twists and turns in the road. This is a very very down to earth film and worth the time to VIEW!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The cinematography, the score, and Richard Gere's performance makes this one of my all time favorite movies.Let's not look too deep. The story is all about making decisions and moving forward in life. We all have to make decisions in life and here is a great movie where a man was not happy with his present situation and couldn't get out of it. He wanted to but was conflicted. Gere just couldn't make a decision and when he finally decides his decision leads to his finding peace.I have read the other reviews and I think that people didn't give this movie a chance. Yes it's simple, yes, we have seen the love triangle before, yes, we have seen Sharon Stone in this role before, but bring all those elements together include Richard Gere (who's best acting before this movie was in "Looking for Mr. Goodbar") and you have a great classic. I recommend turning up the sound at the end so that you can appreciate the score and how the music is a key character in the film.Listen, I am not a Richard Gere fan but he is the most underrated actor in America. He is so good at his craft and has been doing it for so many years that you don't realize that he is working at it. There is a scene when he is parked in front of a diner and he makes a call to his girlfriend with his decision. This one scene is the best acting of his career because it's so natural and unlike Gere as you have seen him in other movies. Check it out...give it a chance....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful, little unheard of film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie I would never have seen had it not been showing on HBO late one night (after a night out). I was intrigued by the opening sequence and had every intention of channel surfing but I'm glad I didn't. The movie is a series of flashbacks that Vincent Eastman (Richard Gere) is having of the demise of his marriage to wife Sally (played surprisingly well by Sharon Stone) and the budding romance he has with the "other woman" Lolita Davidovich. The flashbacks are very entertaining and pull you in as you wonder what Vincent is going to do. Previous to viewing this film, I never thought much of Sharon Stone as an actor but she acquits herself well in this role. I don't want to give away any vital information and I'm not one to point out little nuances that the director might be adding- but it is a thoroughly enjoyable film. Lolita Davidovich is delightful as the quirky breath of fresh air Vince finds surreptitiously. An added bonus: upon recently returning to this film I was bowled over to see that the once unknown daughter of Vince and Sally was none other than a very young Jennifer Morrison (of House and Once Upon A Time fame).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I'm obsessed with this movie. I need to buy the DVD instead of looking for it on TV so often. The intertwining of the 3 main characters (Gere, Davidovitch and Stone) is spellbinding, but almost second to the beautiful scenery and musical score. The choice of the sultry harmonica and violins is so beautiful and only adds to the wonderful story. While rooting for Vincent and Olivia to finally become a couple, and live out their dream of marriage and their dream home...the wedding scene at the end captures your heart, and gives you hope, while the agony on Olivia and Sally's faces at the hospital is gut wrenching.The way Gere's thoughts are captured at the end is remarkable. I've truly never seen anything like it. The way the two women protect each other from hurt is a bit unbelievable, because I tend to think women would rather enjoy letting the other woman know she was his first choice....however, it is sad and kind all in one. It only reinforces that we all need to make every move count. It may be our last. Excellent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this film because it was messy. People's lives are not the pretty package that many movies portray. We don't always make the right choices, our hearts can break and soar in one day, we procrastinate and start too late. I didn't know what this film was about when I first saw it. (I was actually going for the Richard Gere film. Whistle, whistle) But I quickly was captivated by the human-ness of this film. They didn't need to show sex or swear a great deal but everyone in the film was sexy in their own right. I've never seen Sharon Stone give a more emotional scene as when she visited the hospital at the end. Richard Gere showed a vulnerable side when he finally "gets what it's all about". The first time I watched this film I was so shocked by the end that I was frozen. The second time I cried from the phone call to the end because I was so angry that Richard Gere's character died. That his girlfriend believed in him so long and now won't get her life - like he hinted. I truly appreciated that the women didn't give away their own private ending so that each had a good last memory - showing an adult manor and selflessness (usually in a situation one or both may have struck out to hurt one another). I love the human spirit and applaud this film for being so complex. I have to say that most of the time I look for entertainment only - I want to laugh or come away feeling good - but this film is WORTH THE TIME TO WATCH!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting character piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this film has a plot, that isn't the focus. The characters matter here more than anything, for better or worse. While the characters are very developed in their motives, emotions, and otherwise, the story suffers somewhat from lack of attention, which instead is given almost completely to the characters. Again, this may be for the better or the worse, depending on what the filmmakers were going for. The theme of the film is that you should live each day as if it were your last. But the actual development of the story is almost voyeuristic in following an undecided and conflicted Gere around as he goes from wanting Sharon Stone to wanting Lolita Davidovich. He can't decide, and we watch him slowly wrestle with it. This isn't a film with a tight, driven story, but at the same time it's not one claiming to be. It studies three lives, and their slow growth. And Gere's slow development to the decision that was ultimately in him from the beginning. He realizes the truth and then everything shatters, as is what often happens in life. Interesting approach to filmmaking, interesting character piece. At the end I found myself much more involved than I thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not good enough to be good, not bad enough to be "so bad it's good".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This listless and confused tale of love gone lame is useful only as a crystal clear demonstration of the difference between movie stars and everybody else.Vincent Eastman (Richard Gere) is a man with more hair than he can handle, speeding down a road through the Pacific Northwest when he swerves to avoid a stalled hippie van in the road and heads straight on into a semi. In the midst of the accident, the movie becomes a flashback of the last few days of Vincent's life. We see that Vincent is recently divorced from his coldly beautiful wife Sally (Sharon Stone), working to be a good dad to their daughter Meaghan (Jennifer Morrison) and banging his wild, redheaded girlfriend Olivia (Lolita Davidovich). Though Vincent doesn't want to be with Sally anymore, he doesn't want to leave behind his family and the architectural business he and Sally own together. So we get a bunch of blase' crap about him being torn between his old and new life and resenting the fact that Sally is moving on with a new man, even though Vincent hooked up with Olivia when he was still married. Then we get flashbacks during the flashback, showing us how Vincent was never really happy with the controlled and separate Sally and how he was swept away by the lively and engrossing Olivia. Then we catch back up to the time of the accident and, after subjecting us to flashbacks within flashbacks, the movie chucks a few fantasy sequences at the audience and closes with an ending that's supposed to be all touching and stuff, but which actually proves these filmmakers never understood exactly what they were doing with the rest of the film.The most painfully obvious thing about watching Intersection is that Richard Gere and Sharon Stone are movie stars but Lolita Davidovich?not so much. Whatever quality it is that movie stars have on screen, you can see it in Stone and Gere but you couldn't see it in Davidovich with an electron microscope. There's no sin in that. Most actors and actresses lack that quality. But if you're doing a story with three main characters and two of them are played by movie stars and the third isn't, that dog won't hunt. It also doesn't help that Davidovich, while pretty enough by any reasonable standard, is not in Stone's league when it comes to beauty. Olivia is supposed to be this amazing woman who reignites Vincent's passion after years of being unfulfilled with Sally, so Davidovich being less impressive than Stone on just about every level fatally undermines that whole idea.Davidovich can certainly act, though Olivia is such a compromised character she's not really a person as much as she is a puppy dog who'll do anything to make her master happy. Vincent isn't much better. Outside of a scene where he acts like the uncompromising architect out of an Ayn Rand wet dream, he doesn't really do anything but mope around. He's got this lovely, smart, capable woman who gave him a child and is largely responsible for his professional success, but he's not satisfied with her. Then he's got this new woman who's funny and fresh and fiery and only wants to please him, but he's not satisfied with her. I'm supposed to sympathize with this putz?Sally's the only decent character in the whole story and Stone is up to the job. She got a lot of praise for her work in Casino, but I think this film is where Stone really demonstrated her chops as an actress. Sally honestly loves Vincent and there's nothing wrong with her. She simply doesn't have it in her to give Vincent what he needs.So, Intersection is a movie almost exclusively about three characters. Only one of them is well drawn and only two of them are portrayed by movie stars. That cinematic math doesn't add up.There is a ridiculously gratuitous topless scene with Davidovich's perky rack on display. There's also some laboriously ham handed direction that tries to emphasize how deep and meaningful this story is supposed to be. Then there's than ending where these filmmakers forgot that you can't make a story completely about one thing and then make it about something else at the very end.Intersection is another one of those bad films that isn't aggressively bad. It's just so flawed in so many fundamental ways that it can't amount to anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just another remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Europe we often have to endure film-critics who always compare American remakes with the French or Italian original. And they will always say the original was better. Not this one. The original ('Les choses de la vie' with Michel Piccoli) was slow, constantly showing the accident, neurotic camera-work and lousy dialogue. 'Intersection' makes for a perfect 10, not in the least because of the camerawork by Vilmos Zsigmond. Many people had complaints about this film. I'll tell you why : when filmgoers see Richard Gere and Sharon Stone they'll expect loads of steamy sex scenes, and when there's only one such a scene, decently filmed, you will hear the wolves cry.Sharon Stone's best performance !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ultimately uncompelling story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vincent Eastman (Richard Gere)'s car is approaching an accident. In flashbacks, he's having an affair with magazine writer Olivia Marshak (Lolita Davidovich). He is married to Sally (Sharon Stone). They run an architecture company together and have daughter Meaghan (Jennifer Morrison). Sally finds out about the affair and Vicent has to decide between the two women.I saw this in the theaters on a double date. I did not make for good conversation afterward. More than that, it's not a good movie. Vincent is not a compelling character and his affair isn't that compelling either. The movie is prodding and lacks any tension. It's not until the ending where something interesting happens although it's a very manufactured construction. Ultimately, I don't care about these characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It might have been a happy life for Vincent if he had dumped these two shrikes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a fan of Richard Gere but as Vincent he does a very good performance here. When we see the women Vincent is involved with we must ask ourselves the question: 'Does this man really need women?' Sharon Stone's character is an annoying social climber. Olivia is a pushy, interrogating drama queen. Vincent is not shy about showing his annoyance with them but he wimpily attempts to 'be reasonable' and 'go along to get along'--the beginning of male self-castration in marriage. It's obvious to me this man needs his work more than he needs any woman--so why not dump these two ball-busters and and all women. It would be a happier life for him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can understand why the movie is rated 4.9 in 2013. The emotion in both relationship is not well reflected in the first 60 mins. As a men of 40 something, I am not convinced by the screen play. But the final 30 mins really took my breath away, the letters, the red-hair girl, the phone booth, the accident, the dream...... and the final ending.If the director can refine the first 60 mins, this film will be remembered by more audiences.Richard Gere, Lolia Davidovich and Sharon Stone performed pretty well in the movie. The good performance is ruined by the unrealistic story line.I wish another director will re-create the potential masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stone Disappoints.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is by Mark Rydler who has previously directed 'For the Boys' which starred Bette Midler. Some may remember it. But this movie is a step in the different direction. You may ask who he is, but unfortunately I don't have a clue either.Again we have another movie which dwells in to the subject matter of infidelity and extra marital affairs. For some this is a interesting genre, but for others it can be a boring issue. I have watched this for the second time and thus became tempted to post my feelings and thoughts on the movie. Sharon Stone is a fabulous actress, which is why I gave it a second watch. Of late she has aged so much that I miss the good old days !!.****************************SPOILERS AHEAD************************** However let me get to the point. The plot revolves around Richard Gere and his wife Sharon Stone who also have a daughter of age 13. At the start of the movie he has a car crash and we are whisked back in time and to constant flashbacks depicting his marriage life and relationship with the other woman in his life. This happens to be Lolita Davidowich. We are shown how he meets the women and how they fall in love. Gere's relationship with Stone is sour as time had progressed and soon she finds out about this. This puts him in decision making situation, as to whether to choose his wife or lover. Whether he survives or not is part of the climax of the movie.There is not much to offer in terms of plot or character development here though the movie does not focus much on Gere and Stone's marriage life. This had lead me to question as to how did sourness come in to their lives. Gere is first rate and his portrayal of the husband is very convincing. Stone I personally felt was wasted in role where there was more scope to perform. She hardly had any scenes. However she was brilliant which involved her being emotional and angry. Lolita Davidowich is a great actress and shadowed Stone. The movie's pace is too slow and from time to time on is curious to keep an eye on the watch to see how much time is left. Overall this is a average movie whereby the climax will only encourage the viewer to watch till the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gere Up For Double The Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whadaya know: if you're skidding headlong into a death-tastic car accident, and you happen to be Richard Gere, your life *does* flash before your eyes ? well, your *love* life, at least. If you're Richard Gere. Almost a Chick-Flick version of "Memento", as Vincent (Gere) reminiscences back through his life of juggling his lover (writer Lolita Davidovich), with his ex-wife (business partner Sharon Stone), adoring daughter, and a successful architectural profession. The plot hinges on who Vincent will choose as his life's love. Weaved throughout are scenes of a unique clock (which Vincent bought for his lover), with a ball-bearing winding mechanism which tilts one way and then the other, metaphorically mirroring Vincent's indecision.The body of the movie, consisting of scattered vignettes, is rife with clues as to which of the two women would be his ultimate choice: Stone's architectural planner (who, in her most passionate moments with Vincent, exuded a clinical iciness that he chose not to perceive due to her social positioning and surface charms), or Lolita's columnist (independent, yet clutching at Vincent for primacy of attention).His moment of clarity, alas, comes too late. But no matter - he's Richard Gere!(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How did you happen do be up here?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the film last night on TV. This movie was directed wonderfully, the performances by the actors were magnificent; I enjoyed to watch... but personally, there's something not enough to make it a great movie. One of Stone's best roles for sure, she was brilliant, her character was developed very slowly throughout the film; I thought this was great... but then, as the movie ended, suddenly Sharon Stone's character is cut out, wasted in her role. Let's go back to the last scene in front of the Hospital: Suddenly Sally (Sharon Stone) asks Olivia (Lolita Davidovich): "How did you happen do be up here?" Olivia (after thinking what to respond): "I was just on my way to see the museum again... and I saw the car been pulled up on the road" Sally looks at her first: "Well...", then turns away and rips up the letter down a drain. Why does Sally tears the letter? To protect Olivia? Maybe, but this is not the reason (she would have simply kept the letter if she thought this was her husband last testament!). She is doing this because she is hurt, very hurt; because Sally Stone understood her husband (Richard Gere) choice! She's to smart for that. Well, I thought the camera shouldn't have cut so promptly from the pieces of the teared letter in the drain to the final credit scene, but this final scene (so the movie) should have been handled a bit different and stayed longer on the magnificent Sharon Stone's character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I admit to a weakness for any film that attempts to be architectural in some fundamental way. Even the failures - and they are mostly failures - are usually interesting. And this one features a redhead as well, a cinematic device that is similarly architectural in some ways. But that is another story.One of the small number (23?) of plots is: man makes - literally creates - his own world and it turns on him. He usually wins except in `adult' films where he doesn't. In this case, the creative medium is architectural. I'm not usually a fan of Gere, but I have to appreciate the way he moves. He's a dancer and the relationship he has to space is apt. The backdrop is rather ordinary: he is an architect we are told but the architecture shown is underwhelmingly faddish. But there is a nice touch in that the museum is for the Potlatch culture where the space of one is designed by the other side.A particularly apt architectural metaphor for the conflict depicted here, and the gifts exchanged at the end.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the acting in this movie was pretty decent, the plot and storyline were pedestrian, simply showing the results of a bad marriage and the resulting affair, a story we have seen 1000 times. But, to further drop this film into the mire, the story was told as a series of unconnected flashbacks within flashbacks within flashbacks. Now, sometimes, this technique is needed for a particular or special type of story, but here, it is simply annoying. The minimal plot becomes even more meaningless when told this way. Probably the worst film of Gere's career, but not his worst performance (Sommersby wins that honor.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems rather apt that both Richard Gere and Sharon Stone should star in this lame drama, as they both appear to be cultivating a true talent for choosing lousy scripts. "Intersection" makes for a fine companion piece to both these thesps' recent works ("Final Analysis" and "Basic Instinct").Mark Rydell fails to generate any interest in the ordinary plot, the love triangle nor the three lead players. Richard Gere, Sharon Stone and Lolita Davidovich don't help much either, and the structure of the storyline (huh, what storyline?) is poor.All "Intersection" leaves its audience with is the question of why they even bothered. At least something happened in "Basic Instinct"!Sunday, April 24, 1994 - Village Southland</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Goddamn, what a horrible movie this was. Even the ironic piece of "action" that occurs in the finale was not remotely enough to redeem such a bad movie about nothing.Richard Gere plays architect Vincent Eastman, a guy with little or no emotion and far too much indecision for a guy with two women. That is, his ex-wife Sally (Sharon Stone) and his new girlfriend, Olivia Marshak (Lolita Davidovich). He seems to want too much, but can't ever seem to express what it is exactly he wants. And so I'm left guessing what the point of it all is anyways as I sit watching this blasted two hour movie about a guy who can't make up his mind.All of the performers (especially Martin Landau) have done much better. I was expecting some action, perhaps some romance. But it's a series of idiotic flashbacks of how Vincent came to meet each woman and where their relationships starting falling apart, which forces him to mull everything over at the end (in an even slower manner than the rest of the movie). Well, here it is. A story about nothing.</fullReview>
