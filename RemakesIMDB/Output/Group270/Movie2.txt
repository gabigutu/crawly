		<shortDescription>Barrymore Stalks Lugosi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The MARK OF THE VAMPIRE lies heavily upon the terrified inhabitants of a lonely European manor house.In 1935 director Tod Browning set about the remaking of his 1927 silent Lon Chaney shocker LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT. The final result was rather an odd film for the MGM roster, but it benefited by being given the Studio's first class production values and casting. It is a tremendously entertaining film to watch even now, full of chills &amp; suspense.However, at a running time of barely one hour it has been obviously heavily edited. This does not help the already ludicrous plot, many of whose elements simply do not make the slightest sense. It is perhaps just as well to enjoy what the film does have to offer and not to harp about the incongruities of the storyline. The ending will come as a surprise to many viewers - some will be delighted at the turn of events, others will feel betrayed at the final fadeout.The cast is excellent. Lionel Barrymore is at his most eccentrically watchable as the elderly vampire stalker. And who could play the Undead better than Bela Lugosi? Although he speaks not a word until the final seconds of the film he is pure menace throughout, stalking along cobwebed corridors, associating with giant bats and radiating pure evil. Lionel Atwill as a stern police inspector and gentle Jean Hersholt as a befuddled baron complete the quartet of leading actors.Elizabeth Allan is lovely as the menaced young lady, while Carol Borland is properly mysterious as Lugosi's vampiress. Various members of the supporting cast are allowed moments to shine - Donald Meek as the frightened local doctor; Ivan Simpson as the manor's old butler and Leila Bennett as a rather hysterical maid. Movie mavens will spot an unbilled Christian Rub as a deaf peasant at the coroner's inquest.The film's editing sadly left several very fine character actors on the cutting room floor, including Robert Greig, Eily Maylon, Zeffie Tilbury &amp; Jessie Ralph (whose name still appears in the credits).James Wong Howe's excellent cinematography should be mentioned, as should also the creepy special effects which add immensely to the atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Supernatural Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the best vampire films of the classic black-and-white era. Essentially a composite remake of "Dracula" and an earlier film called "London After Midnight" with some bizarre twists, in terms of ghoulish settings and atmosphere, particularly the cemetery scenes, and Lugosi and Borland wandering in the night, this film is second to none. There is no doubt that Bela Lugosi was the classic Dracula of the early sound period. If I were to make a list of his best 10 films, this would be one of them along with the 1931 "Dracula", the 1943 "Return of the Vampire", the 1940 "The Devil Bat" and others. Carol Borland's role as "Luna"sets the standard for "Vampira" of the 1950s and "Elvira" of the 1980s as well as "Morticia" of the Addams Family on TV. She does an excellent job in the role of a "creature of the night". And of course, Bela Lugosi as Count Mora is without peer. The entire cast including Lionel Barrymore, Lionel Atwill, Elizabeth Allen, Jean Hersholt, and others do an excellent job.10/10.Dan Basinger</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the commercial failure of his controversial masterpiece "Freaks" in 1932, director Tod Browning found himself in serious problems to find new projects. Browning was a man of proved talent, being the director of some of the best silent films starring Lon Chaney as well as the mind behind the 1931 horror masterpiece "Dracula". However, "Freaks" proved to be too ahead of its time and sadly suffered the prejudices of audiences clearly unprepared for the tragic story of a midget in love with a full grown woman. In this state of disgrace, the studio rejected his projects and instead gave him the job of directing "Fast Workers", a melodrama with former silent superstar John Gilbert. Fortunately, luck was still on his side as in 1935 he was allowed to direct a remake of his successful silent "London After Midnight", a movie that would reunite Browning with Dracula himself: Bela Lugosi."Mark of the Vampire" is the story of the tragedy surrounding the wealthy Borotyn family. The patriarch, Sir Karell Borotyn (Holmes Herbert) has been murdered under mysterious circumstances, and soon everyone in town suspects it was the work of Count Mora (Bela Lugosi) and his daughter Luna (Carroll Borland), as these two deceased nobles are rumored to awake by night as vampires and wreak havoc in the small superstitious village. Inspector Neumann (Lionel Atwill) doesn't believe in this, as he suspects there is a more mundane motif for the murder of the rich old man, however, when Sir Karell's only daughter Irena (Elizabeth Allan) becomes the vampires' new target, Insp. Neumann will have to join forces with a strange scientist specialized in the occult, Prof. Zelin (Lionel Barrymore) to solve the mystery before someone else gets killed.As written above, "Mark of the Vampire" is essentially a remake of the now lost classic "London After Midnight", although this time Browning enhances the horror elements of the story by focusing on the couple of vampires and their actions instead of the mystery of the plot. The story is pretty convoluted and very clever for its time, with a nice use of black humor (some even see it as a satire of horror films of it's time) and very surprising plot twists to keep the mystery a secret until the end. Sadly (and like always happened to Browning), the film suffered approximately 20 minutes of cuts by the studio, who disliked Browning's idea of incest as background for Count Mora among other things. Unable to fight the studio (as they were still mad at him for "Freaks"), Browning had to let them cut the film, leading to the creation of many plot holes in the already convoluted story, ultimately destroying most of its effect by enhancing its flaws.As in most Browning's films, the power of the movie is in the haunting visuals conveyed by this master of silent films, images so powerful that in a way make up for the messed up and disjointed storyline. In fact (and like "Dracula"), most of the best scenes in "Mark of the Vampire" come when nobody talks and only the images are what carry the story. Taking his expressionist influences to the max, Browning makes the figure of the vampire to embody the ultimate vision of irresistible evil, as their unnatural shining in complete darkness makes them diabolically attractive. Browning always struggled with the use of sound, and this problem shows again in "Mark of the Vampire", although the high quality of his cast manage to improve Browning's direction in this "talkie".Lionel Barrymore is very good as the eccentric Prof. Zelin, and while he receives some bash for giving an over-the-top performance, I think his acting is right on the money, as he is not a serious Van Helsing, his character seems to be wicked, almost as wicked as the monsters he fights, so his hammy touch is, in my opinion, very appropriate. Lionel Atwill shines as Insp. Neumann, bringing a sense of dignity to the film as the stoic hero who is forced to work with what he considers as superstitious fools in order to fulfill his mission. Borland and Luogsi are simply wonderful as the almost silent vampires, relaying mostly on gestures to convey their emotions. Jean Hersholt, Donald Meek and Ivan Simpson have nice turns in supporting roles, with Meek and Simpson delivering some nice comedy that seems to parody stereotypes of horror films of its time.Sadly, the film (or what was left of it) suffers from many flaws that effectively make the brilliant parts of it look bad, leaving the final product as simply a slightly better than average 30s movie. Not only the cuts done by the studio ruined the storyline, as being honest, Browning's talent wasn't as fond of talkies as it was of silents. Browning was a genius of black comedy, but this skill couldn't translate well to sound movies and often his attempts of comedy look too over-the-top for the overall mood of the movie. To make things worse, the performances of Elizabeth Allan and Henry Wadsworth (the main romantic couple of the movie) are atrociously poor, paling in comparison to the work of the rest of the cast."Mark of the Vampire" is a very good film of Browning's short post-"Freaks" career, as despite being plagued by many problems, it still works as a nice tale of mystery and horror. It is definitely not the typical vampire movie, and a number of factors make me to be willing to believe that Browning intended this to be a satire than a proper horror (for example the fact that vampires are silent and humans are very talkative for example). While certainly not a masterpiece, it is a fine film to watch despite its troubled upbringing. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tod Browning's third horror milestone in a row!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tod Browning easily is one of the most important directors who ever lived. Sure, he might not enjoy the same post-mortem status as a Stanley Kubrick or a Alfred Hitchcock but he single-handedly was responsible for some of the most important and genre-forming horror films. In a period of barely 5 years he brought us: Dracula (the mother of all vampire-movies and THE film that made Bela Lugosi immortal), Freaks (still amazingly scary after more than 70 years), this Mark of the Vampire and Devil Doll in 1936.This film more or less is the first accomplishment that `plays' with the rules of the genre and creatively adds some very ingenious twists. A prominent citizen of a small community is killed and the superstitious population are convinced that the bizarre, vicious Count Mora is responsible for this act of terror. Count Mora and his freaky daughter Luna are believed to be vampires and the village's curse. Since the victim's beautiful daughter obviously is the next target, professor Zelin sets a trap the bloodthirsty killer red-handed. Mark of the Vampire is an eccentric horror effort and definitely ahead of its time! The opening sequences are atmospherically frightening and the nightly noises still have the ability to scare you. The illogical ? but extremely dared ? twists near the end easily guarantee this film an honored spot in the horror annals. Please see it for yourself and you'll agree that this film is tough to review! Personally, I thought Lionel Barrymore overacts terribly?.then again, the development of the film provides him with an excuse for this! I am certain about one thing, though! Bela Lugosi gives away an outstanding performance. Naturally, his role here is overshadowed by his starring in Dracula but I dare to say he's equally chilling here. Lugosi almost has no lines to say, but his grimaces speak for themselves. Check it out!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bit creaky and hammy but is still an enjoyable horror from the period</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a small village of Prague, dignitary Sir Karell Borotyn is found murdered and the police put it down to "unknown circumstances". The whole village knows the cause though and the consensus of opinion is that he was killed by the legendary vampire Count Mora. This belief is dismissed by the authorities but seems to be backed up when Mora appears to Borotyn's daughter Irena. Enter Professor Zelen, who plans to save Irena and bring an end to the rule of terror that Mora has brought to the village.I have been watching several horrors from the first half of the last century recently mainly because I am tired of the "shock 'em with gore" school of thought that seems to have replaced atmosphere and creepy direction that should always make up a part of a horror film. With this film the story is actually quite interesting, albeit based on the usual "vampire hunter" storyline but it still works and has a certain amount of mystery to it. This is supported by a good sense of atmosphere and period ? not just all dark shadows and so on but a feeling that this is a real place and that the evil is only a few steps away at any time; hard to describe but it looks good. Of course it is dated and modern horror fans will scoff at it, but it does have some genuinely unsettling moments and the slow movement of Mora and the zombie-ish Luna is effectively used once or twice ? it was only a shame that they had surprisingly little actual time on screen.The cast are impressive on paper and they do a good job on screen. Lugosi may just be doing his usual stuff in a supporting role but both he and the Count are probably the main draw to this film and he provides his usual ham with relish. Likewise the rest of the cast overact a bit but it suits the film and works pretty well since this film doesn't seem to be taking itself too seriously. Barrymore is good and is well supported by Allan, Atwill and Borland. They all play it up a bit and it works without taking away from the creepy atmosphere.Overall it is hardly the most frightening thing you'll ever see, nor does it even come comes but it is still enjoyable and a little creepy if you meet it on its terms rather than with a modern eye. It is creaky and you might get a laugh out of it but viewed as a film it has enough going for it to stand up with some of the more "classic" horrors of the period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tod Browning's return to the genre that made him famous brings along Bela Lugosi to reprise his role as a sinister Count. This vampiric tale is mixed in with a murder mystery. I found the end results to be very weird, unusual and entertaining. What I thought was going to be a routine horror story has a very funny twist. To give it away would be telling. If you're in the mood for something different then by all means watch.Recommended.B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some excellent scenes in this film -- when the Prof peers in the window &amp; sees Carole Borland "landing" -- very surrealistic! Also, when the father &amp; Bela are in the cemetery, motionlessly watching the people looking into the crypt -- creepy sound effects!Also, Donald Meek is excellent as the superstitious doctor.What's wrong with it is that you hardly ever see Lugosi, and Lionell Barrymore REALLY hams it up in the "Van Helsing" role! He moves &amp; speaks so slowly, so deliberately, that one would think that HE'S of the Undead, too! He tries for a dramatic effect, but fails miserably.You may notice the (bullet) wound in Bela's temple; the original storyline had him killed for having an incestuous relationship with his daughter (Borland). That whole scenerio was cut from the film.Even so, this a VERY "odd" &amp; interesting "vampire" film; must see!Norm had Lug</fullReview>

If he had the resources of today's crappy directors there's no telling what this man could've accomplished. It's sad that a man this talented made such few films. This is moody, atmospheric, and has a knockout ending. You won't see it coming. Great "vampire" movie has a cast that isn't cold and entertain you throughout. A great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a nice re-working of the lost classic "London After Midnight" whichtragically perished in a fire, never to return. More a murder mystery than a horror story, "Mark of the Vampire" still has some very nice creepy moments and a fog-drenched atmosphere throughout that will make the twist endingforgivable. Irena Borotyn's father has been found dead, his body drained of blood through two small holes found upon his neck. Is it indeed the work of vampires, as the rumors through the isolated countryside insist? Or is it something else? A year after the murder, the dead man is seen wandering through the night in thecompany of two hideous ghouls. Strange things begin to happen and Irenaseems to be the new target. Can Lionel Barrymore save her and solve themystery once and for all?There are some absolutely gorgeous shots in this film featuring giant spiderwebs, furry arachnids skittering up walls, wolves howling mournfully in thedistance and the silent presence of both Bela Lugosi and Carol Borland,walking in perfect sync together through the misty graveyards and the crumbling castle ruins, he in his cape and she in her burial shroud. There's also a GREAT scene where Miss Borland descends from above on giant bat wings! The plotdoesn't always make a lot of sense, and at films end you discover you've been duped, but this is one of those films that should be watched for its atmosphere alone. It's so saturated with shadows and cobwebs and creepy Gothic splendor that it makes even the sunniest day feel like Halloween night.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interesting movie of a murder taking place in a small town reportedly done by vampires (played by Bela Lugosi and Carroll Borland). Lionel Barrymore (hamming it up) shows up to help destroy the vampires. OK, the ending is horrible (everything is explained away) and the film seems a bit creaky at times but I still enjoyed it. It's very fast (60 minutes) and there are some very eerie scenes in it involving Count Mora and his daughter. The scenes of them traveling around an old castle with some VERY interesting noises on the soundtrack are beautifully atmospheric and quite eerie--even by today's standards. Bela Lugosi and Carroll Borland seem to be having lots of fun in the roles. The rest of the cast is pretty good--especially Lionel Barrymore who really chews the scenery here. Even director Tod Browning does an OK job! I've never liked his other movies (with the exception of "Freaks") but his direction is pretty good here. So, I find it an enjoyable old-fashioned horror movie. I'm giving it an 8. I'd give it a 10 but that lousy ending really hurts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(spoilers) ending is not all that original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite his reputation as a bit of an outsider and even possibly a sadist around Hollywood (he was once described as the only director to surpass Von Stroheim in the area of the bizarre and immoral), Tod Browning was one of the most important film-makers of the silent era and made 2 of the most recognizable films of the early sound era, the original "Dracula" starring Bela Lugosi and the infamous "Freaks." Unfortunately his later effort "Mark of the Vampire" displays the same poor ability in terms of directing dialogue as those 2 films but only a little of their unique visual appeal. Perhaps just as he was emboldened by the success of "Dracula" to make the controversial "Freaks", the failure of that self-same film may have humbled him enough to offer MGM a relatively weak imitation of "Dracula", which he had made for Universal (Lon Chaney having abandoned the project, probably signaling the fact that his loyalty to Irving Thalberg was far greater than any such associations with Browning himself). Other than the creation of a prime female vampire archetype in Luna Mora (Carol Borland) and some nice atmosphere, this film has little that's original to offer.In fact according to David Skaal's excellent biography on Browning, this film was done as a re-make of his 1927 Lon Chaney vehicle "London After Midnight" in an effort to avoid possible litigation from Universal. After all, who could claim that "Mark" was an imitation of "Dracula" when both films obviously owed so much to "Midnight"? The most unfortunate aspect of this decision however is the fact that they retained the cheat ending of "Midnight" where everything is explained away as a conspiracy instead of a supernatural event. Despite the comments of dozens of IMDb users, this was NOT a "highly original" ending and it would not have been hugely surprising to 1930s audiences even if it ironically is surprising today for those who haven't seen many American thrillers from the 1920s (or perhaps a few episodes of Hanna/Barbera's "Scooby Doo"). But watch a few movies by Roland West and you'll see what I mean; this kind of thing was so normal that for the 20s audience the question wasn't so much whether the monsters would end up to be criminals in disguise but rather the basic mystery element of which character was the one wearing the disguise (we also see this device in serials from the 1940s including "The Crimson Ghost"). In "London After Midnight" the surprise was pretty good ? it turned out that the vampire and the inspector were actually the same person (both parts being performed of course by the incomparable Lon Chaney)! This probably surprised audiences since they would have expected the vampire to be one of the criminals, and not the police. In this version we have the much less interesting premise that the vampire (Bela Lugosi) is an actor hired by the inspector (Lionel Atwill) and the vampire-hunter (Lionel Barrymore) to trick the real criminals into revealing themselves.The only really fun aspect to this is the brief comic scene with Lugosi and Borland packing their trunks at the very end of the film. Obviously it makes most horror fans feel "cheated" ? but what they should try to understand is that there was a dual purpose to these types of endings. First, they did act as a kind of buffer between the supernatural elements and the audience, which might have either religious objections to the material or might feel too sophisticated to believe in the material. In that sense, it could be considered a cheat. But at the same time these kind of devices enabled the audience to enter into a kind of proxy world of moral equivocation ? imagine the possibility that any character in the story, from the leading man down to his little old mother, could be "the monster." In the sense by which the audience identifies with the characters in the story, this provides juicy opportunities for the viewer to identify with various possible incarnations of the monster and to experience vicariously the amorality of the adventure. I hope I've given those horror fans who felt "cheated" another perspective on the original appeal of this kind of suspense story.As far as the meat of the film itself, like I said above there are some creepy atmospheric effects including weird music and sound effects and the wonderful image of Luna's transfiguration from bat to woman. I think the scene where she "attacks" the ingénue was probably pretty racy and fetishistic for its time. Lugosi and Borland look nice and creepy, and are kept mostly silent. You might wish Lionel Barrymore would follow their example a little more because even though his style is appropriate for this film there is just too much of him compared to everyone else and it unbalances the film. I think it was supposed to be more humorous than it ends up being, and Barrymore can do the "eccentric" humor (for example in "You Can't Take it With You") so here the blame lies mostly with Browning for the lifeless performance of Barrymore and others. I did enjoy the work of some of the character actors, especially Donald Meek.One final note ? I read through the comments and a lot of people are complaining that Lugosi isn't in the film very much even though he's "top billed". In the print I saw however Lugosi appeared in the second row of the supporting credits and it was Barrymore who was the top-billed star. I suspect these people need to pay more attention to the credits of the film and less to the credits printed on the video box. Of course Lugosi is a bigger star than Barrymore nowadays, but it's completely ridiculous to hold the film to account for an exaggeration made by whoever packaged and sold the video copies currently circulating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All of the essential ingredients for a good vampire film are here, but I guessed who the culprit was from the beginning (and even his motive), but I wasn't prepared for the nice twist in the surprise ending.The story about a vampire stalking people in a picturesque village is handsomely photographed by none other than James Wong Howe and the settings rival any of those used in the original "Dracula" film. This time ELIZABETH ALLAN is the frightened heroine while BELA LUGOSI and LIONEL ATWILL fill their standard horror film assignments in fine form.LIONEL BARRYMORE is Prof. Zelin and seems to have great difficulty in standing on two feet rather than being in a wheel-chair, so early was he inflicted with his rheumatism that forced him to be seated in most of his films by the end of the '30s, notably as Dr. Gillespie in those Dr. Kildare films. He's obviously a replacement for the usual Van Helsing character assigned to solve the vampire mysteries.With a running time of 1 hr. 1 min. there's no time to be bored. A neat little thriller with good supporting roles from character actors like Jessie Ralph and Donald Meek--with all of the histrionics strictly in broad '30s horror style. One of Tod Browning's better films.The atmospheric sets and shadowy but crisp B&amp;W photography are beyond reproach.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an ingenious, delicious film that offers a different take on the vampire tale. It's a remake of director Tod Brownings' 1927 silent "London After Midnight", one of the most sought after "lost" films of all time. It features a number of the trappings of the vampire sub genre, and establishes a respectfully sinister atmosphere. When a man named Sir Karell (Holmes Herbert) is found murdered, an investigation is launched by intrepid Inspector Neumann (Lionel Atwill, who's in fine huffy form). When it's believed that the death was a murder perpetrated by a vampire, an occult expert (a hilarious, delightful Lionel Barrymore) is called in to provide all the advice they could need. And for a while, this plays out the way we would expect a vampire movie TO play out. Our blood suckers are played by Bela Lugosi, once again cast in a perfect sort of role for him, and Carroll Borland, whose striking, long haired Luna can easily be seen as a forerunner to characters like Vampira and Morticia Addams. The cast is rounded out with people such as Elizabeth Allan as the distraught Irena, Henry Wadsworth as her suitor, Jean Hersholt as her uncle, the worried Baron, Donald Meek as Dr. Doskill, Ivan F. Simpson as Jan the butler, and comedy relief provider Leila Bennett as Maria the maid. One can't help but notice just how short this movie is - it runs barely over an hour - and in fact approximately 20 minutes of footage was cut after the preview. Unfortunately, because Brownings' previous film "Freaks" had flopped upon its release, he wasn't able to object to these studio decisions. Still, even in the movies' current incarnation, it works pretty well, with decent special effects and typically solid work by cinematographer James Wong Howe. But the reason why this should be so entertaining is the unexpected ending, which does a fine job of pulling the rug out from under us and turning into a different type of film altogether. Even the actors weren't informed of the big twist ending until it was time to shoot it, which does nothing but add to the effectiveness of their performances. Overall, "Mark of the Vampire" is great fun and a worthy viewing for any fan of old school black &amp; white genre entertainment. Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bela Lugosi is not Dracula here, but is just as creepy if not creepier in this tale of a murder of a respected man of the community. Lionel Barrymore is sent in to investigate the murder, in which it is made to look like it was the work of a vampire. There have been sightings of a male and a female counterpart of the walking dead. They are appropriately disturbing looking, and the special effects and images here are surprisingly real and impressive. The production values here are what really make the film work and sets the mood perfectly. Barrymore tries to act clever and thorough in thought, but instead comes across as a ham, overacting with his lines. Overall, this relatively forgotten film needs to discovered by vampire film buffs of today. I think they'll be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant But Erratic Horror Classic with a Hoodwink Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black and white horror movies from the 1930s and 1940s are probably more eerie than scary. If you're going to enjoy either "Dracula" (1931) or "Frankenstein" (1931), you have to forget about gravity, embrace phantasmagoria, and suspend your considerable disbelief to accommodate raging implausibility. We know cinematic vampires have no counterpart in the real world unless they lurk in the deranged mind of a maniac. Nevertheless, by acknowledging film's fantasy elements, we adapt ourselves to the elaborate conventions of the genre. Vampire movies since "Nosferatu" have dictated that exposure to sunlight is catastrophic for vampires, despite the allowances that Bram Stoker made for his vampire in the 1897 novel "Dracula." The literary Dracula could tread the streets during the day. As a day-walker, he had to sacrifice his full, nocturnal supernatural powers. When F.W. Murnau turned the novel "Dracula" into his 1922 silent epic "Nosferatu," he paid the Stoker estate nothing, and the widow Stoker sued him for copyright infringement. The damage, however, had been done and has only been undone in recent films, such as "Bram Stoker's Dracula" and the "Blade" franchise. When "Dracula" director Tod Browning made "Mark of the Vampire," he maintained without reservation the same rules that governed the eponymous vampire in "Dracula." Vampires walk only by night. Anybody that a vampire bites turns into a vampire. Vampires must sleep in their coffins in their native soil. During the first 30 minutes of "Mark of the Vampire," the habits and life of a vampire are held up to rigid scrutiny. Unfortunately, the rest of the plot doesn't stand up to scrutiny as this lavishly produced MGM film enters its final ten minutes."Mark of the Vampire" qualifies as classic Hollywood hokum which without warning turns the tables on you the same way that "Shutter Island" did with a gimmick ending. The first 50 minutes of this creepy whodunit, set in a remote village in the mountains outside of Prague, are thoroughly engrossing. The last ten minutes, however, may frustrate horror fans who may feel, with some justification, that they have been cheated. Reportedly, Browning didn't let the cast know about the hoodwink ending until he distributed the last pages of the screenplay to them. Mind you, this bit of cinematic lore overlooks the blatant fact that Browning was remaking his very own 1927 silent film "London After Midnight" with Lon Chaney, Sr. All you have to do is compare a synopsis of "London After Midnight" with "Mark of the Vampire," and the resemblance should be conspicuous. Nevertheless, many horror fanatics hate Browning for this anti-climactic ending. They contend that it undercuts the first 50 minutes and takes advantage of its audience's latent obsession with necrophilia.Nonsense! Undeniably, "Mark of the Vampire" bristles with contrivance from fade-in to fade-out. If the horrific elements do not enshrine it as a classic, then the highly irregular methods that the authorities employ to unmask the murderer should endear it to cult whodunit aficionados. Actually, aside from an early clue about the killer's identity, the clever culprit remains at large and opaque. Indeed, the actor who plays the villain was cast against type so audiences wouldn't be inclined to suspect him. Remember, the Prague police have not been able to capture the individual. Now, they are staking their last chance on vampires to flush the killer out of hiding. Meanwhile, no courtroom, judge, or jury would ever convict the dastard who poisoned the nobleman in "Mark of the Vampire." The murder of Sir Karell Borotyn (Holmes Herbert of "International Squadron"), provides the catalyst for the bizarre sting that the authorities launch to catch the elusive criminal. The murderer arranges it so the patriarch's demise appears to be the work of vampires! You see, Sir Karell was found slumped over his desk with two puncture marks in his neck. The local physician, Dr. Doskil (Donald Meek of "Stagecoach"), rules that a vampire drained every drop of Sir Karell's blood from his body. Everybody in the area believes that Count Mora (Bela Lugosi of "Dracula") fed on poor Sir Karell. Police Inspector Neumann (Lionel Atwill of "Mystery in the Wax Museum") is the exception. The dubious Neumann demands Dr. Doskil attribute Sir Karell's death to natural instead of supernatural causes, when he completes the death certificate. A coroner's inquiry later concludes Sir Karell died from causes unknown. The judge dismisses all superstitious beliefs with nothing but contempt. Not long afterward, Count Mora's daughter Luna (Carol Borland of "Flash Gordon") attacks Irena (Elizabeth Allen of "Ace of Aces"), and the authorities are called in to investigate. Prague Inspector Neumann handles the investigation, and he summons a Van Helsing-type occult specialist, Professor Zelen (Lionel Barrymore of "Key Largo"), to protect Sir Karell's adult daughter Irena from future vampire attacks. Naturally, Baron Otto von Zinden (Jean Hersholt of "The Mask of Fu Manchu") wants to assist Neumann with his investigation. Neumann believes that everybody could have murdered Sir Karell. He points out that Sir Karell's death prompted the estate to appoint him as Irena's guardian and executor of the estate.The censorship history of "Mark of the Vampire" exerted a powerful effect on the film. Initially, the Browning film ran 80 minutes, but MGM cut it down to 60 minutes for release. The entire back story about Count Mora and his incestuous relationship with his own daughter as well as his suicide from a bullet to the right temple have been eliminated. Remember, Count Mora has a gunshot wound to the head that is never explained. Later, Poland banned "Mark of the Vampire" and Hungary sliced up several scenes. The cinematography of James Wong Howe sets this movie aside as a classic. Black and white has never looked so spooky. The cast is fantastic, especially Barrymore as Count Mora's nemesis. Bela Lugosi doesn't utter a line until the end and it is hilarious. The cat inside the suit of armor scene is fantastic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Atmospheric Horror Movies of the Golden Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a real shame, to me, how undervalued this movie is in the annals of horror history. As a complete horror junkie, I frequent websites, message boards and fan cons and this movie is rarely mentioned among the greats, which is a shame because it could be put on a par with most of Universal's classic work. I recognize, though, that the bad wrap attributed to it is mostly because of the twist ending and we'll get to that in a second.I normally try to avoid plot outlines and especially spoilers in my reviews, but it seems almost necessary with this movie and if you've read anything about it, that twist has probably been spoiled for you already. The movie begins with the death of a count, which is attributed to a local vampire and his daughter, played by Bela Lugosi and Caroll Borland. These same vampires begin to set their sights on the count's daughter, who has just been married. It is, eventually, revealed that all of the supernatural goings-on are a ruse by actors to try to ensnare the real murderer into revealing himself.Directed by Tod Browning, this movie is a remake of his lost silent feature London AFTER MIDNIGHT, which is oddly probably more well-known despite being lost forever. Browning was a genius horror director of the golden age who has created some absolute classics like Dracula and FREAKS. His marks are all over this movie, which might be one of the most atmospheric films I've ever seen. This movie just screams to be watched at midnight with all of the lights off. We get plenty of Gothic flourishes and spooky props like bats and cobwebs. There is an eerie soundtrack throughout the movie with an ever-present sound of howling from the grave. The entire movie is just permeated with this hypnotic quality. That translates to the performances of Lugosi and Borland, as well, as they silently stalk their victims through the shadows. A few scenes really stand out like the bat to vampire transformations, which are admittedly poorly done by today's standards but nonetheless enjoyable, and the coup de grace, the scene of Borland flying through the air on large bat wings, which is still pretty spectacular.Lugosi puts on one of his better vampire performances here. He has about one line of dialog in the whole movie, but his vampire is far more feral than most of his performances. Carroll Borland steals the show, though, as his daughter. While definitely inspired by the Brides of Dracula, her look is fantastic, with pale skin, sunken dark eyes and that long hair. Her look single-handedly defined the horror queen look that would be repeated by Vampira and Morticia Addams.The "human actors" are not to be outdone, either, as we get some classic horror royalty. Lionel Barrymore is great as the professor and hypnotist who is essentially the Van Helsing of the movie. He has this creepy quality that makes the viewer never quite sure we're really to trust him. Everyone's favorite police man, Lionel Atwill, shows up here as well to play his usual inspector.That ending is what ruins it for a lot of folks, though, but it never did for me. Maybe it's a childhood spent rotting my brain on Scooby-Doo cartoons, but the idea of revealing the monster to be a real person in disguise seems like a common horror theme and, indeed, in almost every spooky movie leading up to the 30s, the monster was always revealed to be a hoax. It's silly, to me. We know that monsters aren't real anyways, right? So, how does it exactly ruin a sense of drama for us if that's revealed to us in a movie? Every movie we watch is make believe, but people hate this one for pulling back that curtain and saying "we were just playing". Browning's history of silent film directing made a definite impact on his style. Really, you could watch this movie on mute and it would still be an eerie, ethereal delight sure to give enjoyment to any classic horror fan.</fullReview>

In the original, Lon Chaney played multiple parts. Here his roles are divided among Lionel Barrymore, Bela Lugosi, and Lionel Atwill. Lots of horror fans dislike this one because they feel the ending is a cheat. I thought the ending was great, though it might not hold up on closer scrutiny of certain previous scenes. The entire movie plays out more like a murder mystery with horror overtones rather than a straight horror film, so I didn't feel cheated at all. It's beautifully shot by James Wong Howe. The cast is great. Lugosi barely says anything but is a menacing presence in a Draculaesque role. Carol Borland is sufficiently creepy as his "daughter." Definitely a keeper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is genuinely one of a kind, turning several vampire conventions upside down including a knockout ending. Despite appearances, it's a subtle spoof, combining gentle humor with some truly scary scenes, along with just about every loose creepy crawly in Hollywood. And get a load of Luna (Borland). It's a terrific make-up job. Those black odalisque eyes are really something. In her flimsy vampire gown, she looks like a guy would either hug her or drive a stake clear through. And good-girl Irena (Allen) is no slouch either- - when she suddenly stares wide-eyed under a spell, I was chilled to the proverbial bone.Then there's Hollywood's official humanitarian, Jean Hersholt, all characteristic sweetness and light, and somehow I didn't even mind Barrymore hamming it up shamelessly as the professor. Then too, this may be Lionel Atwill's only non-villainous role in a whole catalog of memorable bad guys. Still, his inspector manages to look sinister just standing around. Actually, I spent half the movie ducking all those flying bats that seem to turn up out of nowhere. Now if they could have just done something about that thunderous musical score.I did have trouble following the plot. But, that's okay because these neck-biters depend on atmosphere rather than story, and this one has a ton, thanks to big-budget MGM and a number of eye-catching sets. And, how about when the bat turns into Luna in a great special effect that, when you think about it, doesn't make much plot sense. Anyway, it's a clever slice of studio movie-making. I just wonder what movie-goers of the day thought, given conventional expectations. The first time I saw it, I had to pinch myself given my own expectations. Still and all, this horror flick remains unique, even in this day of souped-up special effects and loosened standards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vampire movie with a twist!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Universal Pictures may have been the king of horror films, but "Mark of the Vampire" released in 1935 by MGM, showed why MGM overall was the Tiffany of the movie studios. The film has the stamp of MGM's excellent production values. The original "Dracula" released in 1931 by Universal, while a classic and rightfully so, is a grainy and sometimes awkwardly acted and edited film. Some of this just shows how far film making had come in four years, as 1931 was still a rough transition to sound films - but Universal Pictures was a poverty row studio next to MGM. In this one, Bela Lugosi reprises his famous role, but he is not the main focus of the film. Lionel Barrymore gives his usual crotchety performance as a man knowledgeable about vampires, and Lionel Atwill as a detective not convinced vampires are real. It all gets quite complicated, complete with the lovely girl who allegedly comes under the vampires spell. But the real star of the film is the creepy atmosphere director Tod Browning sets - it is wonderful. Everything from the flying bats, spiders, and creepy mansions look fantastic, especially by 1935 standards. The ending completely blew me away - I had no idea! Check this one out and forget the plot - the set designs, the scary atmosphere, and the look of the vampires alone make this one worth the effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great, but quite entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a nobleman is murdered, an investigation into his death and subsequent targeting of his daughter suggests that there may be vampire activity happening. But this is something that the local authorities cannot accept.The Mark of the Vampire was one of Tod Browning's films after Dracula (1931) and Freaks (1932), and in my view, is one of his weaker films. This seems to be a mystery story with an undercurrent of comedy (and satire?) against a Gothic horror background. And it is entertaining. It's actually quite a fun popcorn movie. But I'm not sure I would call it a good movie.There are some very good elements in it. Bela Lugosi, as Count Mora, is an almost completely silent, very menacing presence, and Carol Borland is very eerie as the seductive female counterpart to Lugosi's vampire. The film presented some beautiful Gothic settings and some eerie scenes-Lugosi and Borland walking silently, single file in the castle...so dignified, yet very frightening. And there is a whole undercurrent of comedy in this film that makes it quite enjoyable. I am reminded of The Addams Family television series and Plan 9 from Outer Space, with maybe a little bit of Clue thrown in when watching this movie.But the film, both the plot and the actual editing, seems very disjointed at times, as if the viewer is missing big pieces of the puzzle, and the "twist" ending is just confusing and draws a lot of what preceded it into question.In the end, I'm not sure if I would call this one "so bad it's good" or if it is just good because it is entertaining, despite its flaws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incongruent film wherein Lionel Barrymore (as Professor Zelin) arrives at an eerie castle to investigate the owner's murder. Owner Karell Borotyn is said to have been found "drained" of his blood, with the telltale "Mark of the Vampire" bite marks on his neck. With Bela Lugosi (as Count Mora) wandering around in full vampire garb, there is little doubt about where to pin responsibility - but, not everyone believes in vampires? Director Tod Browning and photographer James Wong Howe achieve some great visuals; especially with the vampirific Mr. Lugosi, and Carol Borland as his female counterpart "Luna". Leila Bennett (as Maria) and Donald Meek (as Doskil) are a couple of supporting players who impress. "Mark of the Vampire" is a re-make of Mr. Browning's "London After Midnight" (1927), which had starred Lon Chaney and Henry B. Walthall, in the roles portrayed herein (more or less) by Mr. Barrymore and Jean Hersholt. Assuredly, Chaney and Walthall's portrayals were not improved upon. Although "London After Midnight" is a lost film, an examination of its script and restoration will reveal how re-filming a story can sometimes drain away its life blood.The earlier film is structurally similar to this one; a comparison indicates that Lugosi may have been originally planned to play this as Chaney did, acting both "parts" - this might explain the apparent gunshot wound to Count Mora's temple; certainly, there is no other explanation offered. Both films, by the way, include the "surprise" element concerning the vampires, and feature the same "trick" ending. ***** Mark of the Vampire (3/28/35) Tod Browning ~ Lionel Barrymore, Jean Hersholt, Bela Lugosi</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mark of the Vampire" is another well done film from MGM. Bela Lugosi stars as Count Mora(of course, seeing him in his costume makes him look like Dracula no matter what). I was disappointed that he didn't have any speaking lines until the very end of the film. Carroll Borland plays the Count's daughter Luna. Her portrayal was that of an aggressive bloodsucker compared to Universal's more reserved vampires. The film rivals Universal Studios' horror films scene by scene. There are some very strong elements. The acting was very good and the sets added an eerie touch. Bela Lugosi, Director Tod Browning and actor Michael Visaroff all worked on "Dracula"(Visaroff plays an inn-keeper in both films). Overall, a very nice job all the way around and one film I recommend to all horror buffs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is deeply saddening when a writer and a director get carved up by the Censors. As a filmmaker and screenwriter I know this pain well. Browning had a wonderfully intricate, and delightfully meaty tale to tell, but what came out of the hacking process is sad. The Vampire Milieu is fraught with bad films and novels, and tragically this film has to be put in with them despite the brilliant direction and casting. Count Mora and his Daughter could be the subject of their own film, and that would be a treat most delectable!. The plot such as it is: vampires are suspected of murdering nobility in a small "county" in Romania. Expert "Sage/Monster Hunter" gets called in, Police Inspector is baffled and skeptical. Culprits denounced, all is well, mystery solved. No big changes in the formula, until that beautiful ending(and what an ending--I WON'T spoil it--you'll wriggle your toes in glee after you see it!)Bela and his life long devotee/groupie/protégé', Carol Borland(she who makes Elvira and Morticia and Vampira look like old washed out trash) chew up the atmospheric scenery like hungry Allosauri, and Lionel Atwill does his most UN-Moriarity like acting while Lionel Barrymore annoys the heck out of you, but actually makes the "Van Helsing" character seem more like the WIZARD OF OZ. Borland's "flight" and "landing" are astonishingly realistic, and she could fly beside Christopher Reeve's Superman anytime! She lights up the screen like a thousand watt bulb! Lugosi's end of film lines, a rousing egotistic boast, sound dead on realistic, and give a good hint into his own inner mental workings (Borland said in interviews, he actually WISHED HE COULD BE Dracula for real!).</fullReview>

The scary moments in the movie are set against a musicless background, much like Dracula, to enhance their effect. The sets are great, especially the vampire's stomping grounds, which includes lots of dust and cobwebs. The vampires themselves are nice and pale, if not a little wooden and hollow. Barrymore gives a wonderfully crusty and eccentric performance as Zelen and the plot works very well up until the end. I won't give anything away other then it's a major letdown.6.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same faults as Browning's Dracula</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS***Mark of the Vampire, about a young heiress being apparently menaced by local vampires, is director Tod Browning's follow-up to his earlier classic Dracula. It shares several similar images including an amadillo pretending to be a rat!! It also shares Dracula's many faults including the lack of a music score, feeble stagey direction with long, static takes, and also heavy pre-release cutting which has deleted huge sections of the narrative and a general tendency to cowardice when faced with any potentially horrific moment. Lead actor Barrymore, acting throughout as if he is drunk on set, is for example, introduced in mid-diagnosis with presumably his entire opening appearance left on the cutting room floor whilst Donald Meek's character completely vanishess from the film after being in most scenes during the first twenty minutes. Browning once again cops out on showing close-ups of vampire bite marks and is so reluctant to show anything horrific that one of Lugosi's major scare appearances unfolds via a flashback in order to reduce the tension rather than in real-time as it was surely meant to. Vampires Lugosi and Carol Borland, who looks great as his waif-like offspring and was surely the prototype for Moricia Addams, are given tiny screen time. The twist ending (they're not real vampires after all) didn't annoy me too much, although it clearly makes nonsense of various previous dialogue scenes between characters who are later revealed to be "in" on the plot, but what was pretty unacceptable was the way that Barrymore solves everything via some quick hypnosis which completely nullifies the whole point of his vampire charade (and the "vampires" don't even feature in this denouement). It also, you will note, relies heavily on the fact that the villian still has all of his murder weapons, such as syringes, handily in his jacket pocket a year after the killing !! A disappointing and pedestrian experience although, with a ham cast like this, never uninteresting or dull.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a slightly jumbled story about one or two vampires in a generic Middle-European village in what appears to be the 1930s. Tod Browning or no Tod Browning, it's a B movie with opulent MGM sets.MGM always seemed to have a lot of money. Louis B. Mayer was committed to movies that presented a rosier view of typical American life, "family pictures" as they were called, like "Meet Me in St. Louis." (Not a hint of Judaism anywhere.) He ran the studio and his heart just plain was not in these horror movies. They came out as mere imitations of Universal's cash-register demolishing monster movies like "Frankenstein" and "Dracula." This one has quite a line up of performers. Lionel Barrymore, Lionel Atwill, Donald Meek, Bela Lugosi. There's a helpless young lady with two tiny dots on her neck. There's young woman who never speaks or smiles, and she's made up in a ghoulish white with black lips and shadowed eyes -- and wings. There's hypnotism, drugs, a protective weed (batbane, I think it was, not garlic). Lugosi has his cape to fling across his chest. I think he has about five words in the entire film. Bats abound, but no fangs.Now, I don't want to go into the plot or its resolution because legal confidentiality applies here. That's one reason. Another is that the Big Reveal comes at the end and would spoil everything that precedes it if it were spelled out. Another reason is that I'm not sure I understood it.You know how Universal's monster movies were Gothic, spare, and somewhat drab in their sets? Not here. Cedric Gibbons has hung the walls with all kinds of period junk. And it's lovingly photographed by the tasteful and intelligent James Wong Howe. The actors sometimes seem to be treating the story as a comedy. There's a lot of overacting in front of those baroque objects, particularly from Lionel Barrymore.The available print was cut by some 15 minutes or so, and it shows because there are scenes that tell us nothing about the characters or the plot. I've never seen Bela Lugosi LURK so much.If you like spooky stories, even those that are more than usually lacking in sense but still carry a bit of poetry, this may be your kind of flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sir Karell Borotyn is found dead, drained of blood. Most people suspect a vampire however the policeman investigating the murder will have none of it. However year later, with no solution in sight, it would appear that the dead Sir Borotyn has returned and is in the sway of long dead vampire and his daughter.Let me put in on the table, this movie is a mess. Its nowhere near as exciting as I make it out to be. Much of the mess is due to this film being cut down from about 75 or 80 minutes to 60. The studio balked at some questionable allusions (incest even among vampires is a no no) and some other bits of plot, so they were hacked out with the result that a good portion of the film seems to be leading up to something that never comes. Yes there is a resolution but there are still a good many bits that just sort of hang out in space (like some unexplained bullet holes). Its not a bad movie, its just not a very good one.The real reason to see this film is the cast. Lugosi is the name draw, but his role is mostly silent and he isn't really in it all that much. He's fine doing the typical vampire thing, but its mostly window dressing. The real stars are Lionel Barrymore as a professor brought in by Lionel Atwill as the pair trying to solve the murder and prevent the vampires from taking any more victims. They are a real treat to see in action (even if Barrymore seems to be in another movie at times with his mannered performance.) Adding to the fun is a sterling supporting cast including Jean Hersholt (you know that weird humanitarian award at the Oscars every year? This is the guy it was named for) and Donald Meek as the local doctor who insists that vampires are scientific fact.This is a movie to watch if you're a fan of the actors or are having a multiple movie night on the TV. Its okay by itself, but it really needs to have a reason to be seen other than as an hour long time killer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When young Irena Borotyn's father appears to have been murdered by the vampire Mora (Bela Lugosi), the eccentric Professor Zelin (Lionel Barrymore) is called in to investigate. It starts off as a remake of Dracula with another pairing of director Tod Browning and Bela Lugosi but in the last act it veers in completely different direction. I don't want to give away the ending so let me suffice to say it's preposterous (More preposterous than vampires? You bet!). Not that it's such a bummer, there are some great horror moments prior to the end and if I willingly subject myself to thirties horror-movies, I guess I shouldn't complain about believability. What does tip the scale in the downward direction, however, is the presence of Lionel Barrymore in the Van Helsing-part. The more I see of this actor, the more I actively dislike him. His annoying tics and mannerisms, his rasping voice that sounds like rusty nails on a blackboard, his insufferable smugness that must pass for jolly eccentricity, he makes me want to gouge my eyes out so I won't ever have to look at his performances. He nearly ruined Key Largo for me, but where he failed there, he succeeds with flying colors in Mark of the Vampire.**</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mark, Shadow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes a genre overripens then gets reborn with a new fold. Such was the case with the recent "Shadow of the Vampire," which I thought was one of the most intelligent movies of 2000. It features two layers: the actual reality of the vampire and a "new" layer showing the overarching film reality. Naturally, one bleeds into and drives the other. That's not quite what have with this, 65 years earlier and surely embedded in the genesis of the genre. But this is close, so close.Tod Browning is surely one of the filmmakers worth watching. In this edition, he already stretches the bizarre world he lives in, one of freaks and madmen. This time, his mad scientist is a surrogate of himself, part obsessed and part creator of the world of obsession.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb craftsmanship...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing that struck me most about Tod Browning's remake of London AFTER MIDNIGHT was the outstanding craftsmanship- in particular, the cinematography. The cinematography alone makes MARK OF THE VAMPIRE a must-see for Fright Film fans: it's beautiful and atmospheric and almost without peer in the genre- and Browning's direction here is even better than it was in Dracula, because MARK OF THE VAMPIRE lacks the stagey, often plodding pace that often slowed Dracula to a crawl. It would've been interesting to see a Big Screen version of VARNEY THE VAMPIRE directed by Browning; MARK OF THE VAMPIRE, like Dracula (the Novel as well as the Movie), owed more than a little to VARNEY, anyway. Lionel Atwill steals the show, here, as was his wont.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice little filler with more than a hint of Dracula about it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that after the controversy of FREAKS, Tod Browning decided to play it safe with this film, unfortunately. What could have been an interesting little shocker is marred by a seen-it-all-before feel which comes from the fact that most of the action and events occurring are very similar to ones already portrayed in Dracula. Let's face it, this film offers up little in the way of originality, apart from a twist ending. However, if you're a fan of classic '30s horror then this film is still worth watching for some spooky moments where characters stumble through a misty graveyard and are pursued by those big, flapping rubber bats of which Universal were so fond. Otherwise it's a simple drawing room melodrama with lots of people arguing and not exactly doing much. The same old vampire folklore is gone over again adding to the sense of déj? vu.One of the film's big pluses is the excellent cast. Not one, not two, but three notable actors team up for this little flick and give it their all in over the top performances. Lionel Barrymore really gets his teeth into the role of Professor Zelen, an excitable fellow who rants about vampires non-stop until you think he's going to have a heart attack. Lionel Atwill also turns up as a gruff police inspector, essentially playing his powerful, brooding role which he always played - great! And one of the biggest names of all, Bela Lugosi, turns up in a cameo role as a mock-vampire who walks about occasionally but spends most of the time off screen! At least we get a classic Lugosi one-liner at the end of the film which almost made it all worth it. Also check out Carroll Borland's turn as a well spooky vampire girl who spouts giant bat wings in one hallucinogenic scene.Okay, so MARK OF THE VAMPIRE's real strength lies in its cast, but some real atmosphere and a sense of foreboding evil is built up with the vampires lurking about outside in the darkness. Added to this the classic cobwebby sets (which have all manner of creatures, from cockroaches to spiders to rodents running about) and lots of melodrama and you have a nice little '30s filler which doesn't amount to much but remains enjoyable throughout its short running time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well--if all the classic horror books I've read over the years are true--then "Mark of the Vampire" takes its source material from Lon Chaney's lost film "London After Midnight." And that may be where the biggest problem with this film comes from. I don't think I'm giving anything away from a movie this old--but the plot twist that Bela and Carol's characters are not "actual" vampires, but rather paid actors in some half baked plot to expose the real killer of the film is very disappointing for an old school horror fan like me.In fact, if you're one who is viewing this primarily for the presence of Lugosi, then you can't help but feel let down--this is more like one of Bela's "red herring" roles where he was cast more for his name value on the marquee. Of course, all the actors are fine in their roles, but why this film had to dodge "real" vampires--particularly in the wake of Bela's success about 4 years earlier as the "real Count Dracula" for Universal Pictures is beyond me. Overall, I would say it's not a terrible film by any means, but not one I may revisit for many repeat viewings.5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I truly enjoyed the 'Mark of the Vampire," and I consider it one of my favorite Universal horror movies of all time. Bela Lugosi, Lionel Atwill and Lionel Barrymore make for a superlative movie double play combination. However, I have always wondered who had attacked Fedor, the male love interest in the movie; for he wasn't in on the plot to trick the Baron into re-enacting his crime? On two occasions he mentioned having being in a deep stupor. Could it be that he was a victim of the 'real' Count Mora. Also, how did they clean-up the abandoned castle so quickly to re-enact the crime? It is still a great little film but I wonder if about 10-15 minutes of critical film were lost on the editor's floor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a vampire that one would expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enjoyable vampire film with Bela Lugosi again playing a vampire after Dracula. Pretty easy going and what a twist towards the end of the film as not everything is not what it seems. The twist demonstrates that this is not the kind of vampire movie that one would normally expect. It is instead a plot line that is pivotal to what is truly been going on in the movie. It is rather interesting on when this movie was released in 1935 as noted by the DVD commentators. The commentators said that this was released at a time before World War II as no one was worrying about some guy called Hitler. Looking at this with the benefit of the passage of time since its release it certainly presents the innocence of the time prior to the horrors the world would see in a few years subsequent to its release. The performances were overall fine and Lugosi seems to enjoy playing another vampire whose name isn't Dracula. Definitely a good way to pass the time. An easy-going fluff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting idea mired by plot holes so big you could walk through them, yet I liked it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This starts out looking like a conventional horror film. Baron Otto (Jean Hersholt) comes downstairs to inform the servants that their beloved master, Sir Karell, has been murdered.Upstairs, in Sir Karell's office, the slumped body of the nobleman is examined. Dr. Doskil (Donald Meeks) is the superstitious and nervous one. He notes the two marks on Sir Karell's neck (not that big of a deal, maybe there before the murder), and that the body has been completely drained of blood (a very big deal, impossible to explain). His explanation - vampires. Inspector Neumann from Prague (Lionel Atwill) basically says poppycock, and goes around doing a methodical investigation, but comes up empty handed.Nearly a year later, shortly after the marriage of Sir Karell's daughter, Irena, to a young man with no real station in life or money of his own, odd things begin to happen. A local legendary vampire father/daughter team - Count Mora and daughter Luna - are spotted wandering near the old castle where the baron was murdered. Apparently the trauma of living in the same place where her father was killed was too much for Irena, so that castle was abandoned and now she is living in equally luxurious digs nearby. First Irena's husband is attacked near the old castle, but escapes with his life, then the vampires Luna and Mora start showing up and repeatedly attack Irena, and it is found that Sir Karell's grave is empty. Professor Zelin (Lionel Barrymore) - obviously a clone of Dracula's Van Helsing, shows up and assures everyone that this is the work of vampires, that Sir Karell is now one himself, and Sir Karell's daughter is next.Unlike Dracula, there turns out to be a logical explanation for everything. Or at least there is supposed to be - I'll let you watch and find out. Just suffice it to say that this evidence of vampirism is a huge ruse backed by the police that includes just about everybody being in on the plan EXCEPT the person that the police believe is guilty. If they are wrong, they have probably tipped off the actual murderer! Now let me go through the rest of the plot holes. Sir Karell's castle that the vampires haunt was a beautiful home just a year before at the time of the murder. In just one year's time the windows are broken, the masonry is crumbling, there are spider webs everywhere, and rats and huge spiders rummage through what one can only call ruins? The actual murderer gained nothing by committing the murder - the murderer never got what the murderer wanted, and apparently didn't even try to get it after Sir Karell died. So what was the point? Plus the film clearly shows one of the "vampires" turning into a bat - with no logical explanation. Finally, there is no satisfactory answer as to how the killer removed and disposed of all of Sir Karell's blood.Why do I like it? The performances and the pace mainly. Everybody is perfect at their roles. Atwill as the stiff police inspector, Elizabeth Allan as the distraught daughter, Donald Meeks as the nervous physician, but most of all Lionel Barrymore as the vampire hunter was a delight. He took what could have been a hammy role and made it work. He would have been a great Van Helsing in the original Dracula.There were tons of scenes deleted from this film that might have caused it to make more sense, including the description of an incestuous relationship that existed in life between legendary vampires Luna and Count Mora that explains the bullet wound clearly visible in Mora's forehead that left me scratching my head UNTIL I heard the commentary on the DVD. For MGM to mainly be a studio for churning out dramas not horror in the 1930's, I think they did a good job with this one considering the limitations the production code put on them at the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mark of the Vampire apparently had a script change at some point in production, which gave it the controversial ending. I'm on the side of the naysayers- this is an above average, minor classic film, but fell flat for me at the last minute.Director Tod browning creates an incredibly eerie atmosphere, the mood is appropriately supernatural and even a bit sad....Count Mora(Bela Lugosi) and his "undead" daughter Luna radiate a convincing fear inducing allure. These are some of the spookiest moments you will ever see in a 30's horror film. The counterpoint offered by actor Lionel Barrymore in his Van Helsing-esque role is very satisfying (some find his character annoying, to me he is the eccentric uncle that everyone wishes they had)....However,the final 10 minutes upends the entire previous action, and the film concludes with a prosaic resolution. This may leave some viewers unsatisfied or even cheated.Overall, a good film that was probably marred by meddling censors. Watch it if only for historical purposes, but please watch it- late at night! Six stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Films and stories with a twist at the end can be risky. If they get it right ('The Sixth Sense' and 'The Others', for example), audiences will be thrilled and eager to watch the production again to look for clues as to the denouement. Other ventures, such as this one, has proved to leave audiences feeling betrayed and reticent to re-view such a tremendous build-up, knowing that the final revelation is such a colossal let-down.By 1935, director Tod Browning's career was floundering. Three years earlier, his 'Freaks' production met with a disastrous reception for one reason and another. Here, he returned to more familiar ground, reuniting with Bela Lugosi (whom he directed in the ground-breaking 'Dracula' in 1931) in a remake of Browning's 'London After Midnight' (1927).What might have made the build-up even better would have been if MGM hadn't cut out nearly 15 minutes from its original version. Amongst the material cut was the story of Count Mora (Lugosi) and his incestuous relationship with daughter Luna (Caroll Borland), his subsequent killing of them both (explaining the bloodshot he sports on his temple throughout) and how he was condemned to spend eternity as a vampire.What we have left is one of the most beautiful horror films ever made. Languid, steeped in atmosphere, meticulous in detail, sumptuously played (Lionel Barrymore's Professor has been criticised by some, but for me is a perfectly judged creepy performance) and seductively directed. The murder victim is played by Holmes Herbert, (an actor curiously denied enough credit for his many horror roles) and it is his murderer Baron Otto (Jean Hersholt) who is the subject of a colossal hoax upon which the 'twist' hinges. Apart from the twist being unreasonable on many levels, Otto is hypnotised into a confession at the end anyway, rendering the hiring of actors to create the whole scenario pointless.Such a huge shame. Everything else is so good, from the grotesque hag being frightened by a bat at the beginning, to Luna's spectacular (but briefly featured) flight on outsize wings (a scene that took many takes to perfect), there is a rich sense of eeriness throughout. Lugosi plays his second vampire film silent (except for his brief dialogue at the end, as the actor PLAYING the vampire), which was (probably unintentionally) mirrored by Sir Christopher Lee's second outing as Dracula in 1965, which was also without dialogue.</fullReview>

Bela Lugosi plays the boss vampire and has his clutch, coven,(?) of lesser vampires. So they get together and go looking for their lair. They find it but don't do much. In this version the vampires can only be killed by cutting off their heads and putting a special plant in the neck cavity. Using a ploy to find out what happened in Irena's fathers murder it is found out that Baron Otto was the culprit. He put something in the wine leading to daddy passing out and the Baron then made it look like a vampire did it. So the Baron is caught and it turns out Bela and his brood are just a traveling troop. Now I will confess from the way they presented everything that part took me by surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting atmosphere and spooky photography almost save this from ridiculous conclusion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MGM hopped on the horror bandwagon with this remake of their lost silent classic "London After Midnight" and produced a Gothic atmosphere to rival the Universal classics. It wasn't MGM who provided this film with its spookiness, but its veteran horror director, Tod Browning, who had directed the original as well as such classics as the original "Dracula" and the controversial "Freaks". Everything starts off fine (for the audience that is) as a mysterious murder takes its victim by draining blood from their necks, leaving them as dry as the Sahara. The blame is put on a supposed local vampire count (Bela Lugosi in a mostly silent role) and his equally dead daughter (Carroll Boland) who roam through a cobwebbed castle with an eerie gait. When Lugosi and Boland are on screen, the film has an atmospheric, almost sad like quality, although comical moments of an old hag running through a cemetery while trying to escape a gigantic bat and two travelers spooked by the presence of the ghostly pair reacting in quite the overly dramatic way.What weakens the film is the controversial ending which changed the fact that Lugosi's Count Mora had a sexual relationship with his daughter and committed suicide after killing her which was the reason for him becoming a vampire. (Pesky Hays code...) Lugosi has a very visible bullet hole, and the twists that changed the plot make their characters seem unnecessary to the plot as a whole. The twist at the end is a bit upsetting considering the insinuations which remain in the plot, but overall the film is well done and quite enjoyable. The cast is filled with many excellent actors, most notably Lionel Barrymore, Lionel Atwill, Donald Meek, Elizabeth Allen, Jean Hersholt and the unbilled Louise Emmons as the hag running through the cemetery. I mention her because some people might confuse her with Lucille La Verne who played La Vengeance in MGM's "A Tale of Two Cities" the same year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Browning's Detective Tale, Take Two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a nobleman is murdered, a professor (Lionel Barrymore) of the occult blames vampires; but not all is what it seems.This film started out as a remake of Tod Browning's silent film "London at Midnight" (which has unfortunately since been lost in a fire). Following his time making "Dracula", it seems only natural that Browning would cast Bela Lugosi as the Count in this film. Perhaps this gives the impression this is connected to Dracula (it is not) or perhaps it helped typecast Lugosi, but it was the right casting choice.The cast is rounded out with the two great Lionels: Lionel Atwill and Lionel Barrymore, as well as the striking Carroll Borland as the Count's daughter. Borland had previously appeared with Lugosi in a stage production of "Dracula" and was thus a natural fit. Her look in this film allegedly inspired the look of Lily Munster, as well as Vampira in "Plan 9 From Outer Space" (though this is disputed).Apparently between its creation and the form it takes today, twenty minutes were cut from the film that suggested themes of incest, suicide and some class humor. As this footage is no longer in existence, it is hard to know exactly how true this is and how subtle such themes were.Although no one denies the strong acting, interesting plot and solid direction, the film has got something of a bad rap over the years because of a particular twist in the plot (which shall remain unrevealed in this write-up). Is the criticism fair? Not really. Although it may not go in the way fans wish or expect, one can hardly deny Browning's clever turn on an already familiar genre.As a special note, it should be pointed out that the script was written (at least in part) by Guy Endore. Although Endore does not have strong name recognition today, he was instrumental in popularizing horror films in the 1930s, both with this film and "Mad Love", not to mention his werewolf novel "The Werewolf of Paris" (1933), which predated Universal's "The Wolf Man" (1941).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the early part of the movie we get the best depiction of vampires in American cinema to that time. We get great foggy sets beautifully photographed by James Wong Howe, the first apparent morphing of a bat into a vampire, a scene of a female vampire flying, the first female-on-female vampire action, the first vampire hiss, the use of real bats hanging from coffin lids and on walls (slow-flying artificial bats look bad). We also get the ridiculous appearance of an opossum (they were apparently necessary to stand in for rats because rats were too disgusting).***SPOILERS GALORE***Through most of the movie we are encouraged to believe vampires are attacking people. It is a real let-down, therefore, to discover the vampires are impersonators being used by the police to catch a murderer. The impersonators act exactly as you would expect vampires to act, even when there is no reason for them to remain in character. We naturally assume they are vampires. Our expectations are dashed, however, when a self-professed vampire hunter, well played by Lionel Barrymore, sees the vampire ruse is not working and hypnotizes the real killer to get him to re-enact the crime. Just why the police think fake vampires will get the killer to confess is baffling; and the abrupt change from a supernatural to a conventional mode undercuts everything that works best in the movie.I don't know who to blame more: Tod Browning and the writers for the clumsy mix of mystery and horror, or MGM for axing 20 minutes from the final cut. Whoever is to blame, the result is a muddled remake of Browning's silent "London After Midnight."The incongruous combination of supernatural and conventional elements makes one wonder if Browning and writer Guy Endore started out to make a true vampire movie (hence the original title "Vampires of Prague") but were forced to mute potentially salacious content by restraining it within the fictional devise of Browning's earlier film. Even before strict enforcement of the production code the studios knew they were playing with fire. Before MGM released this movie suggestions of incest between Count Mora (Bela Lugosi) and his daughter Luna (Carol Borland), and a murder/suicide that led to their becoming vampires, were cut from the final print. What's left is pretty tame (notwithstanding the cool imagery) and shows why horror projects dried up in the second half of the decade. "Dracula's Daughter" from Universal in 1936 may have been the greatest vampire movie of all if James Whale had been allowed to proceed with the script he collaborated on. But a prologue set in the 14th century explaining the origin of Dracula's vampirism was excised along with references to his daughter's present day sadism and hints of how she tortured her victims. The project was given to Lambert Hillyer when Whale backed off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How To Spoil A Movie With A Ridiculous Twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Dracula and Freaks, Tod Browning's 3rd sound horror movie was this atmospheric semi-remake of London After Midnight, a silent smash he'd filmed with Lon Chaney. Browning comes dangerously close to plagiarising Dracula in the opening sequences, and as it goes on the director continues to borrow from his earlier movies.For one thing we have Bela Lugosi as Count Morla, Drac in all but name. Here he's largely reduced to the sort of pantomime villain Christopher Lee was forced to play in his Hammer Dracula sequels. This time, however, Morla has a daughter Luna (Carroll Borland) and the vampiric duo haunt a Balkans village where just a year before a vampire-like murder had been committed.Borland lends a genuinely sepulchral air to the proceedings in her white burial gown and early "Goth" make-up. Lugosi skulks around to good effect. We also have a Van Helsing type on hand to combat him in Professor Zalen (Lionel Barrymore). Unfortunately Barrymore gives a wildly exaggerated performance humming and fussing about, bending and gesticulating, that overbalances the film at times. Lionel Atwill lends his bluff presence to the role of the Police Inspector, a sort or try-out for Inspector Krough in Son Of Frankenstein.The film looks splendid, with genuinely atmospheric sets and glossily lit graveyards. The final third of the movie is a crashingly dull expose of the original murderer - it turns out the vampires are actually hired actors engaged by the police to catch him; something which blows to smithereens the carefully constructed eeriness of the film. How on earth they managed to rig up Luna for the film's most impressive moment, the vampire's daughter gliding serenely to earth on giant bat wings, is never explained.So for all its atmosphere Mark of The Vampire is a cheat to audiences, who by 1935 had already grown used to the supernatural in horror films. It's almost as if Browning is playing a huge practical joke for his own amusement. If you can get past the absurd twist you can appreciate the merits of the movie as described above. It might have been a classic if the vampires had been real...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MGM has a lot to answer for. A great deal of time, money, and marvelous talent went into "Mark of the Vampire," only to find 15 minutes (that's 20 percent) of it left on the cutting room floor. Releasing a scant 60-minute movie, the studio reportedly cut the comic relief and also very obviously cut material crucial to continuity and consistency. The plot is left so full of holes that I doubt I could have followed the action if it hadn't been for the number of familiar actors, all doing fine work here: the Lionels Barrymore and Atwill, Gene Hersholt, Donald Meek, and especially Bela Lugosi, who is given only one delicious line, absolutely worth the wait. Even more impressive than the cast is Todd Browning's direction (what's left of it), Cedric Gibbons' classic sets (ditto), and the gorgeous chiaroscuro photography and fluid camera-work of James Wong Howe (and ditto).Whether or not you approve of it, the surprise ending is a botch job. The movie plays like a straight vampire movie? disastrously edited, but captivating all the same. Then comes the last 10 minutes. You feel cheated, and not just because the movie abruptly transmogrifies into a vampire-free murder mystery: The action was all elaborately staged to entrap a murderer by a detective, a professor, a girl, a butler, actors playing vampires, and a menagerie of real bats, rodents, and what I think was a huge scorpion. The real problem is those inconsistencies. Consider just one whopper: the girl's fiancée gets a vampire bite early in the movie, yet later she apologizes for not letting him in on the plan and all the fake vampires. Uhhh? so he was the only victim of a real vampire? Oy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OH NO! Bela Lugosi in a bait and switch! Up until about the last twenty minutes, this one had all the marks of a classic 1930's vampire tale. It had most of the lore down pat, like the fang marks on the neck and the sunset to sunrise dirt nap. But then a curious thing happened, and poor old Irena Borotyn (Elizabeth Allan) had to contend with faking the return of her murdered father to put away the bad guy. I had a feeling something was up with all this since Irena never displayed any bite marks, unlike her fiancée Fedor (Henry Wadsworth). Come to think of it, since all of this was a con job, someone will have to get back to me on why he had those in the first place.Apart from all of that though, I thought the picture did a pretty nice job with the early exposition and the creepy atmospherics. You won't find a better fog enshrouded countryside this side of "The Wolf Man", and Bela Lugosi struck just about every classic and iconic Dracula pose you could ask for. The addition of daughter Luna (Carol Borland) was a nice touch too, her zombie stare was priceless. Having Lionel Atwill on hand was a bonus, and Lionel Barrymore put just the right amount of camp into his role considering how it turned out.Ordinarily I'd be miffed with the kind of twist ending this one had, but director Tod Browning managed to pull this one off without too much aggravation on my part. It was a bit more clever than having the story turn out to be a dream sequence. Still, I would have preferred for this one to be handled as a 'real' vampire tale.</fullReview>

What with the spooky "castle" (which seemed to go to rot WAY too fast for only having been abandoned for ONE year instead of five) overflowing with cobwebs, flying bats (more convincing than most you see in Universal or Hammer Films), spiders, opossums (but no armadillos), and a lot of elements of the plot in general, this seems like a slightly slicker "MGM" version of Dracula. Carole Borland plays "Luna", looking a LOT creepier than the same character from the silent version. It's weird, one gets the feeling that after seeing this film, the people at Universal may have decided to try and be as "different" as possible when they did they own film a year or so later, Dracula'S DAUGHTER. (The only thing that one had in its favor was Edward Van Sloan, and, for maybe 10 seconds, tops, the ACTUAL staircase from Dracula.) Watching both versions (sort of) back-to-back, it's very easy to see all the differences. But strangely, it also makes it a bit awkward trying to follow the plot of the remake, as the original is so strong in my mind. Honestly, I'm of mixed feelings about this one, having now seen it at least 3 times. VISUALLY, this film has it WAY over Dracula'S DAUGHTER on every single level. On the other hand, plot-wise, it seems almost completely DISJOINTED-- and I mean ALL the way thru. There's just something "not right" about the script, the directing, the editing... all of it. At it's WORST moment, Dracula is a vastly superior picture. You just wish the technical end of it had been up to MGM's standards (especially the one scene where the "vampire" changes from a bat to smoke to human form right before your eyes, MUCH smoother than it EVER happened in ANY Universal film). But the rest... I dunno. Something was "off"-- and I mean BADLY.Still, it's fun to watch, if only to see several cool actors going thru their paces, and to witness some of those really cool sets and visuals. I sure wish I could actually see a print of London AFTER MINDNIGHT to really compare it against, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror's first twist ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mark of the Vampire" is another Tod Browning classic.**SPOILERS**After an attack on Irena Borotyn, (Elizabeth Allan) a terrified village calls for Prof. Zelin, (Lionel Barrymore) suspects that the local Count Mora, (Bela Lugosi) and his daughter Luna, (Carroll Borland) are the culprits behind the attacks. As Irena starts to come under Mora and Luna's spell, Prof. Zelin races to stop their spell.The Good News: After having done two of the most influential horror films in the 30s, Browning comes back and does his third masterpiece in a row. The level of atmosphere and mood in here is right up there with the greatest in the era. The opening scenes are perfect, as the horse-drawn carriage, fog-banks, and howling wind give the scene a real flavor. Even the jump at the end, with the snapping twig a perfect ending. The castle at the end of the film is the traditional Gothic, gloomy castle, and that means it's effectively chilling. More time was needed there, but the amount of time we are there, we get a great sense of it. Long hallways, low-lit rooms, dusty furniture, and a sens e of it hiding some grave secrets are perfectly captured in the film, and it adds a real shiver down your spine. Also, I think this might be the first horror film to feature a twist ending, it is one real twist. It comes out of nowhere and is quite shocking.The Bad News: As great as the twist ending is, it does diminish the earlier part of the film. It pretty much negates the rest of the movie just so the twist can exist, and that hurts it a little bit. Also, despite being top-billed, Lugosi has very little screen-time, so fans of his expecting him to chew the scenery like in "Dracula" may be a disappointed.The Final Verdict: If you can get around a great, if damaging, twist at the end, this is another one of Browning's classics. Well worth seeing for the classic horror fans, as well as those that like the old Gothic horror films. Also, Lugosi fans take caution, as he doesn't get the most time on-screen.Today's Rating-PG: Mild Violence</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great for a Dark Night, But Don't Reveal The Ending!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a Tod Browning film with Atmosphere with a capital A. It's also an 'A' list horror film from MGM with superstars Lionel Barrymore, Jean Hersholt and Lionel Atwill, who are great to watch throughout. Unfortunately, Bela Lugosi as the vampire has only a small role with just a couple of lines of dialog. Despite this minor flaw, the movie is great viewing for a dark night due to its excellent production. (Note: Bela narrates the trailer for the film, giving him more lines than he has in the whole movie!)'Mark' tells the story of tracking down the vampire killer of Sir Karell Borotyn (Holmes Herbert), and stopping the vampire's attacks on his beautiful daughter, Irena, played strongly by Elizabeth Allen, who can be seen as Lucie in 'A Tale of Two Cities' (1936). Lionel Atwill, so wonderfully stiff and gruff in his 75 films, plays the skeptical police Inspector. He's best remembered for the Universal 'Frankenstein' films 'The Son of Frankenstein' (1939), with his wooden arm, 'The Ghost of Frankenstein' (1942) and 'The House of Frankenstein' (1944) as well as his countless villainous turns in so many movies. 1930s superstar Jean Hersholt plays Irena's guardian, Baron Otto Von Zinden. He was the hero in Erich von Stroheim's 'Greed' (1924), and was a major star on radio and in films for his role as the kindly, fatherly, Dr. Christian (1939-1943). And what can you say about Lionel Barrymore? He does a fine job here, but is much better in Tod Browning's 'The Devil Doll' (1936) with a mind boggling performance. He has great film credits too numerous to mention, from Billy Bones in 'Treasure Island' (1934) to 'Key Largo' (1948) and 'It's a Wonderful Life' (1946), and his endless turns as Dr. Gillespie in the long series of 'Dr. Kildaire' films. He also played the role on radio (1939-1942). He was obviously the model voice for Dana Carvey's 'Grumpy Old Man' on 'Saturday Night Live' (1986-2000).This film is squarely in the tradition of DON'T REVEAL THE ENDING!! movies. I can say no more. But even after the twist ending, the film is still enjoyable the second or more viewings. Browning had definitely improved as a director of 'talkies.' Thanks to James Wong Howe's wonderful photography, we get great shots and ensemble interplay among our three stars. Lots of moody atmosphere. Several sets are from 'Dracula,' as well as are many shots including 'walking through the cobwebs,' a throat staring Irena, the opossum, rats and spiders creeping around, etc. The film is consistently enjoyable due to its high quality art production, acting and photography.Because twenty minutes were cut from the film before release, there are several oddities about who, what and why; but this doesn't really detract from the overall effect of the movie. I'll give it a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First film ever ruined by a stupid twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's impossible to understand why the makers of "Mark of the Vampire" choose such an idiot twist for an ending, after 45 glorious minutes of atmospheric Gothic horror, amazing sets, and some phenomenal jobs by Bela Lugosi, Lionel Atwill and Carol Borland in a role that was a direct source of inspiration for Ed Wood's Vampira and Morticia Addams. In fact the first half of the movie is even better than the classic "Dracula", visually astonishing, with a plot that caught you completely, but all is ruined with one of the most ridiculous twists ever made in Hollywood. But I must recommend this movie, no matter the ending, to any fan of classic horror films. It's sad to know than almost 20 minutes of footage was cut and lost, with some extra footage and a different finale this movie could easily rank among the greatest horror movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing Horror Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mark of the Vampire" was one of MGM's infrequent ventures into the horror genre. The film was a remake of Lon Chaney Senior's "London After Midnight" (1927) both directed by Tod Browning.The story revolves around the murder of Sir Karell Borotyn whose body is discovered drained of its blood and with two tell tale fang marks on his neck. The murder is suspected to have been committed by vampires. Inspector Neumann (Lionel Atwill) investigates but finds nothing. Later we learn that a coven of vampires has apparently taken over the run down castle next door.Into the case comes Professor Zelin (Lionel Barrymore) who believes in the vampire theory and sets about to prove it.The murdered man's daughter Irena (Elizabeth Allan) suddenly is attacked by a female vampire, Luna (Carol Borland) the daughter of the sinister Count Mora (Bela Lugosi) both of whom are seen prowling about the grounds after dark.Baron Otto von Zinden (Jean Hersholt) and Irena's suitor Fedor (Henry Wadsworth) fear for her safety. Professor Zelin continues his investigation and discovers Sir Karell's body missing from his crypt. Later the professor and the Baron enter the castle to destroy the evil and..............Being an MGM production, the settings and atmosphere of the film were far above similar films from other companies. The film however, was apparently cut from 80 minutes to 60 minutes and it shows. The Barrymore character for example, appears out of nowhere without introduction leaving one to believe that a scene introducing him was cut. There are also some elements of comedy present that are not fully developed. Given the off beat ending you have to wonder if the picture was intended as more of a spoof than what it is.Bela Lugosi plays a "Dracula like" character here and several scenes recall his "Dracula" (1931) performance also directed by Browning. Carol Borland makes a scary vampire. Her makeup is excellent and the scenes with her and Lugosi are as good as anything in "Dracula". Barrymore camps it up as the "star". His performance borders on comedy making the viewer wonder if that was what was originally intended.Jean Hersholt is good as the Baron as is horror veteran Atwill as the police inspector. Donald Meek as the meek family doctor is also excellent.The jury is still out as to whether the unexpected ending to the film adds or subtracts to its overall impact. It left me confused.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully Gothic atmosphere let down by vague storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some puzzling moments in this film that don't seem to make sense, until you realize that a number of scenes were either cut or shortened. For example, there apparently was a scene filmed in which the young hero Fedor is shown to collapse outside the vampires' castle, and is apparently attacked. When he shows up later and tells about this incident, we're not sure if it's supposed to have actually happened or not. The movie is quite entertaining, even if a bit slow and talky in places. The scenes of Count Mora and his ghostly daughter (Bela Lugosi and Carroll Borland)stalking their victims in the foggy night and lurking in their ruined castle are absolutely splendid. The opening sequence, in which an old hag is puttering around in a graveyard, to be frightened away when a large bat flies low past her, is the kind of Gothic atmosphere old time Hollywood caught so well on film. SPOILERS AHEAD: In order to avoid giving away anything to viewers who haven't seen the movie, I'll merely say that the ending is one of the biggest letdowns in movie history, and the reason why this movie doesn't have a better reputation. Flawed as it is, Mark of the Vampire is still worth seeing, just to savor those fabulous moments, such as when two men are peeking through the ruined castle's windows and see the beautiful vampire girl hovering in the air on large bat wings, to fly down and make a graceful landing. That's almost worth seeing the entire movie for!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Admittedly, 'Mark of the Vampire' may not be the best vampire-film out there. I haven't seen Browning's original Dracula yet (for which I am kicking myself as we speak) so I can't compare it with this one. At any rate, Terence Fisher's 'Dracula' is a lot better (although sometimes lacking the bizarre atmosphere of this film). The main problem with 'Mark of the Vampire' is that it's not really a vampire-film, even though it aspires to be. A disappointingly small section of the film is devoted to Lugosi, and in the few scenes in which he's clearly visible, he doesn't succeed in making the scary impression he is so famous for. As an old-fashioned mystery film with a surprise ending, or merely as a monster film with some truly beautiful special effects, 'Mark of the Vampire' certainly passes the grade. But if it's plain and simple bloodsucking and long sharp fangs you're after, go see 'Nosferatu' one more time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, the pace is like lead, the acting wooden, and the sets cheap, but this is a landmark vampire film with tremendous atmosphere. If you fast forward through all of the dialog, and concentrate on the scenes with Lugosi and female Vamp Carol Borland, this is a great black &amp; white flick. Carol Borland made the look, costume, and make-up of "Mora" all by herself. She created the iconic and classic visage of the feminine blood sucker. It's worth noting that she was only 17 or so when she first met Lugosi. She was kind of a Bela "groupie" and met him backstage as a teenager. That began a long association which ended when Lugosi died in '56. Neither would speak about their personal relationship, but rumors still continue that an affair existed. At any rate, this is director Todd Browning's last decent film before fading into oblivion, and one of Lugosi's most memorable performances as the "Count".</fullReview>

The photography is excellent and has that MGM sheen, and the lighting and makeup are all fantastic. The sets are superb and there is one incredible scene of wire-work that is frighteningly flawless. The problem here is the ending. Most Horror buffs take this stuff very seriously (as did the 1930's audience). Their "Famous Monsters of Filmland" upbringing has enabled them to be proud of their "ghoulies and ghosties, and long leggedy beasties", when others, who are less enlightened, only scoff. So, the final few scenes are an insult to the audience who went along, got suckered in, and MGM said...Ha! Ha! How can you take this inferior stuff seriously. Fact is they do. Universal's James Whale had fun with his films but never lost respect for the fans.Shame on this uppity studio for their condescension.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A beautifully photographed remake of the silent classic, "London After Midnight," "Mark of the Vampire" suffers only in its final moments, when the plot takes a nosedive into the land of incredulity. That said, the film is still a wonder to watch, as Lugosi (who does not speak until the last 30 seconds or so) and creepy crew (including teenager Carol Borland as his vampire companion) stalk a baron's home. Lionel Barrymore plays a quirky vampire hunter closely patterned on the Van Helsing character from the 1931 Universal film version of "Dracula," which also starred Lugosi. And plays a Mina Harker-like victim. For all intents and purposes, Lugosi is playing Dracula here, but the character is given a different name. This is an MGM job, not a Universal title, so that might have had something to do with it. Apparently, the studio cut the living hell out of the film before its official release, and the truth is, what remains makes absolutely no sense by film's end. But it is still an eye-catcher and a perfect Halloween flick. Considering Lugosi has just about no dialog, he still makes for an incredibly menacing presence. Not even a decade later, he would again don the cape for Columbia's RETURN OF THE VAMPIRE, but by then the devastating effects of his drug abuse had taken its toll -- and it shows. Watch this puppy for historical value, if for no other reason. And I must add that Borland is incredibly creepy as the mute vampire daughter or whatever she is supposed to be. She seems to float at times.</fullReview>

Baron Otto (Jean Hersholt) and Dr. Doskil (Donald Meek) are convinced of it, while the police inspector (Lionel Atwill) from Prague refuses to believe. Prof. Zelin (Lionel Barrymore), who specializes in the occult, must convince him that a dead count and his wife (Bela Lugosi and Carroll Borland) walk among the living and threaten both Karell's daughter and her fiancé (Elizabeth Allan and Henry Wadsworth), along with everyone else in the frightened village. At least that's how it all seems ?I had been warned by every review of this film that the ending is bad. But I had no idea. I won't spoil it?you wouldn't believe me even if I told you. I'll just say the last ten minutes will turn you into a Tex Avery character, with your mouth dropping to the floor and your eyes bulging to cover your head as the sound of a car horn expresses your shock.What disappoints me is that none of the movie is all that good. I mean, yeah, it has a lot of spooky, fog-drenched scenes; it has rats, bats, opossums, spiders, cobwebs, dust; there are empty tombs, corpses playing organs, vampires walking through graveyards. In short, there's all the stuff that pleases fans of Universal Horror movies?and by extension, the MGM horror movies that resemble them.The deal-breaker is the storytelling, which is a headache long before the thumpingly stupid last reel. The plot moves forward in irritating jerks; characters react to strange events like no human beings that ever existed; people are stupid or incompetent just because the plot needs them to be. And I wanted to do a little grave robbing of my own and throttle the ghost of the eminently slappable Leila Bennett, who plays the screaming maid.The director Tod Browning steals, and expands upon, a lot of the effects he used for "Dracula" at Universal. Lugosi even returns to play a very Dracula-like character. But it all comes to naught. Reportedly the flaws are due to studio interference. Whatever the reason, this movie is very, very bad. And by the end, we can add about 3,672 more "very"s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing to see here. MGM hired Bela Lugosi and Tod Browning to reproduce their 1931 hit, Dracula, except they subtract a lot of Lugosi's role. We get a copy of the vampire's famous descent of the staircase, with the infamous armadillos replaced by a possum (although I kind of remember there being a possum in Dracula, too, but I could be wrong). The production, direction, and acting is all at least a step below Dracula (which I don't think is a film that holds up all that well anymore anyways; I gave it a 7/10). Lugosi, in the few scenes he's in, is on autopilot, as well as Tod Browning.The only thing of interest is the ending, which, well, isn't all that convincing anyway and feels like a cop-out. It's short, so if you are a classic horror fan, this might be worth seeing, at least as a curio. It's worth is still little. 5/10.</fullReview>

But the twist ending is a joke, akin to a Scooby Doo episode but without the buildup or humor that you expect when watching Scooby Doo.SPOILERS The plot is so full of holes that it's hardly a shame to give anything away. But here's the big one: the Baron kills the Sir Karill, apparently with an eye on eventually getting to the daughter's inheritance. He makes it look like vampires did it (with an extremely hokey scissors pinpricks and a heated glass to completely drain the body of blood???). Separate nit: You never see any neck wounds on anyone so are never sure what the heck is really happening. So to trap him, Zeler enlists actors and an exact duplicate of the dead Sir Karill to act like vampires??? Huh? To create a fear factor that will render the baron susceptible to hypnosis? WTH?? The Baron knows he ? not vampires ? killed the count. Vampires showing up now MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE. The jarring revelation of this (plus the creepy old castle suddenly becoming clean and modern) will leave you wondering what the heck is going on.Separate nit: In re-enacting the killing, the duplicate count decides to go ahead and drink whatever the baron prepared for him knowing it's tainted. WTH? That could be poison! With the blood drained, who could tell later what killed him?] BTW, just how did Luna transform into a bat (or even have a bat flying around) if they weren't real vampires? See the Trivia that it took 3 days to shoot this shot. If you like old films for old films sake, maybe you'll enjoy this. But as far as a story, the ending will make you feel cheated and confused.</fullReview>

Though this film has a fine cast and some effective, atmospheric direction, the "plot", while seemingly clever and even "post-modern" in reveal, makes very little sense when you see the film a second time, not to mention feeling like a cheat, though it is amusing in a way.

		<shortDescription>creepy and spooky and kooky... and not altogether very scary or funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tod Browning is such a major talent in the early stages of the horror film in US cinema that even a work that doesn't quite make it up as high as Freaks and Dracula should be given some notice. Mark of the Vampire is not quite self-conscious or poorly made or silly to be camp, though a few bits are (kitty in the knight's armor anyone?); it's shot with the eye of a seasoned professional in creating mood with smoke and fog and eerie low-lighting and sets made of darkness and (actually good) dummy bats that fly into a scene out of the ether, though it's not quite a great horror film. It's a take-off on the Dracula story in its essentials- a vampire is hiding in his castle and only a know-it-all bad-ass professor can put a stop to it before a female subject is taken under by the Count's spell- and in more ways than one.It's very hard to reveal the movie without at least mentioning, if not outright giving away, what the "twist" ending is. I will say it is clever, if only because a certain actor, let's call him Mr. Old-school Dracula himself (yeah, that one, creepy Hungarian extraordinaire), doesn't say a word throughout the film and then in the *last* scene has dialog that is absolutely uproarious, if only for those who know who this Hungarian is. The rest of the film is decently paced, though at times my mind started to wander as to whether or not a scene could use a little more outrageous or oddball comedy, or if a scare actually worked (one of the things I did love were the maid and butler as they're repeatedly freaked the hell out as they put up bat-repellent in the rooms).And sure, Lugosi, when he shows up, is amazing, and Lionel Barrymore, not a first-timer in a Browning picture, walks a good line between going into too much ham (as the actor was awesomely was once quoted as saying) and being a legitimate lead quirky hero. But I wasn't quite drawn into the action, and perhaps the final "twist" gave it away as what was wrong - or maybe what was right as well. Mark of the Vampire is very well crafted, to say the least, and perhaps some of its flaws or slightly "rushed" feeling may be due to not having 20 minutes of footage that Browning had shot. What's left is a good movie, certainly fun for fans of the stars, but not a great one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Different Vampire Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ted Browning surprised audiences in 1935 with this Vampire film starring Lionel Barrymore, (Professor) who lived in a rather spooky mansion. Elibabeth Allan,(Irena) lost her father in a very mysterious death and Lionel Atwill, (Inspector Neumann) decided to investigate just how this man was killed and evidence revealed that he was bitten by a bat or vampire. The Professor decides to work together with Jean Hersholt, (Baron Otto) who was a good friend of Irena's father and find out just what is going on in their house. There is a woman vampire and Bela Lugosi, (Count Mora) who start biting everyone in the house and you begin to wonder if everyone is going to die. There is a very strange ending to this film and I doubt if you will ever find out how it ends. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film several years ago in a colourised format. It just didn't work. Last night I watched it once again but this time in glorious black and white. This is the way films like this should be seen. The absence of colour enhances the creepy atmosphere within films of this type. Loaded with atmosphere, lots of dark shadows and weird sound effects, this movie surpasses the original Tod Browning version of 'Dracula' from 1931 in my opinion.If you are interested in murder mysteries, then the plot has an interesting twist. The combination of logical police deduction and supernatural horror makes for an interesting concept. It is shame that this concept has not used more often.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Traditional Vampire horror - eerie sound effects make up for its problems...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with the previous reviewer - the sound effects are very spooky! Great value just for the sound.I watched this film in total darkness and after midnight. Despite it's problems (they were still adapting to talking movies at this stage?), it has the quality of a traditional horror that cannot be found this day and age, no matter the budgets and special effects! This film keeps your attention till the end... and there are a few laughs along the way.The ending is unexpected - it did not bother me - but in some strange way I found it to be a little 'disturbing'. You'll find out when you watch it! My favorite character (and possibly the scariest) was Count Mora's daughter, 'Luna Mora', played by Carol Borland.Hope my review was helpful :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather creepy vampire movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mark of the Vampire is a rather creepy vampire movie from MGM. I've seen this a couple of times.A series of strange murders in a remote village turn out to be the responsibility of Count Mora, a vampire who haunts the place. He has a woman who helps him along with another bloke. Police are assigned to the case but they don't believe these killings are the work of Mora at first. They do when they go to his very eerie castle.At Count Mora's castle, we get to see its other residents, including bats, rats, spiders and other horrible creatures. With plenty of foggy atmospheres too.The cast includes Bela Lugosi (Dracula) as Count Mora, Lionel Barrymore (The Devil Doll), Lionel Atwill (The Vampire Bat, House of Dracula), Jean Hersholt and Elizabeth Allan (Grip of the Strangler).Mark of the Vampire is a must for fans of old horror. Excellent.Rating: 3 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has one of the stupidest endings of any so called horror movie I think I have ever seen. It's like a bad Agatha Christie rip off. Lionel Barrymore is bug eyed in a clumsy role as a hypnotism-endorsing cop, I think, but I was never quite sure. The whole story is annoyingly confusing. A complete and thankfully not too long waste of time, which throws away Bela Legosi's presence on very insulting terms. What was Todd Browning thinking here?For truly great old time shock, check out his version of Freaks. Now that's a good movie.Ps: laugh riot cheap looking plastic bats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vampire movie that sucks...and I don't mean blood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some good points to this movie, including interesting secondary characters, wonderful scenery and classic horror set design. But it really seems like two movies running along side each other, a vampire tale and a detective story. The vampire characters (especially knowing the ending) don't have any reason to be hanging around the baron's house, but they flit in and out without really interacting with the other characters (except for blood sucking). The humans only *believe* the vampires have anything to do with the case, but they're just window dressing.The murder mystery is running along on a different track, engineered by a very intense Lionel Barrymore. (Note the clever Lionel train pun. This movie actually has TWO Lionels, Barrymore and Atwill.) The ending was a tacky, let's-hear-a-rim-shot weak joke, and brings even more into question what Bela &amp; his babe have to do with anything else in this movie.Overall, not particularly scary, with lots of stock situations and roles. Look for Lugosi movies where he actually interacts with the human characters, instead of just biting them: those are the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror with a twist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to spoil anything for you but the story was much different from what I expected it to be. The ending was highly original to say the least. One of the first real surprise endings for a movie in movie history? I wouldn't at all be surprised if this was the case.The movie is a sort of remake of "London After Midnight" from 1927, also directed by Tod Browning. A literally still as of today lost movie, with Lon Chaney in the main part. The movie starts of as a typical Dracula movie, with once more Bela Lugosi in the role as the Count, as the movie progresses the story is taking a twist, which I'm not going to spoil.Lugosi fans don't get high hopes. Lugosi's role is fairly small and he doesn't have any lines (untill the ending). Still true fans should be able to still appreciate his presence and grimaces. The real main character is played by Lionel Barrymore. It can't exactly say that I'm happy about this to be fair. I really don't like this acting and he was even irritating me at points. I would have had much more preferred to see Edward Van Sloan reprise his Van Helsing role. Afer all Professor Zelin and Van Helsing are basically the same sort of characters so I don't understand why they didn't tried to get Van Sloan back, to reprise his role? It was kind of fun to see Lionel Atwill in this. Atwill has played various roles in dozens of Dracula and Frankenstein movies, before and after this one.Horror fans will most likely be disappointed by this movie and perhaps will even feel cheated afterward. Still this movie is a 'little classic' that deserves some more recognition, were it alone for the daring and unusual twist in the movie. And oh, I just love the final lines of Lugosi in this movie!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moronic movie drained dry (pun intended) of horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is bursting at the seams with the paraphernalia of horror films: bats, rats, cats, owls, spiders, eerie background music, somber organ music, sinister conversations overheard from behind screens, and terrified screams galore. (Not to mention a possum!) It's almost as if this were one of those horror house amusements for grade school kids on Halloween. "Ooo! Scary!" The plot makes absolutely no sense, and the twist ending knocks it all into a cocked hat anyway.There are some remarkably tiresome performances, led by the bombastic Lionel Barrymore as the "Professor." Lionel Atwill is equally tiresome as the skeptical police inspector, who keeps demanding rational explanations even as the place is crawling with fiendish creatures and supernatural events.Of course, that twist ending renders all those creatures and events null and void.Bela Lugosi and Carol Borland are quite enjoyable as "vampires," and I wished they had more screen time in place of those blowhards. Same with Donald Meek. Always a pleasure to watch, he mysteriously disappears from the cast after the opening sequences.Twenty or so years later, Hammer Films brought new life to vampire and other horror movies. "Mark of the Vampire" has lots going on, but none of it is convincing as horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a Mystery Film Than a Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Visitors to a small Central European village are regaled with horrifying stories of vampires from the local citizens. Things become even more serious when a wealthy old patron, "Sir Karell" (played by Holmes Herbert) is found dead with two suspicious marks on his neck. "Professor Zelin" (Lionel Barrymore) and "Inspector Neumann" (Lionel Atwill) are initially doubtful and suspect everyone and everything. However, when Sir Karell's daughter, "Irena Karrell" (Elizabeth Allan) is attacked and found with two marks on her throat, things start to get interesting as the local villagers begin to suspect "Count Mora" (Bela Lugosi) and his daughter "Luna" (Carroll Borland) of vampire activity. At any rate, there is more to this story than meets the eye and rather than give it away I won't go any further with the plot. I will say though, that while the acting on the whole was rather good, I found the action to be both limp and routine. Especially on the part of Luna and Count Mora. However, both Lionel Barrymore and Elizabeth Allan gave good performances and they helped lift the film somewhat. Even so, this film is very short (lasting only 60 minutes) and I only found the first 45 minutes or so entertaining. As far as the ending was concerned it just seemed too simple and unrealistic. But that's just my opinion. Be that as it may, this film is more of a mystery film than a horror movie but in any case might suffice for fans of either genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly awful horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, a talkie remake of a 1927 silent film is a disgrace to the MGM studio. First, MGM -- not your typical producer of horror films -- cut the film drastically, from 75 minutes down to about an hour, and that's about 60 minutes too long. Some say that the cuts were due to incestuous overtones of the relationship between Count Mora (Bela Lugosi) and his daughter. Other reports say that what was cut was humorous material that detracted from the story. Oddly enough, while many production values were relatively high, you've never seen such fake looking bats, and never seen such a lousy script.Perhaps the only value in watching this film is to see some of the actors. Starring, most surprisingly of all -- Lionel Barrymore! This was before his health issues had put him in a wheelchair, although you can see that arthritis was already deforming his hands. He must have been terribly embarrassed at having to appear in this film.Jean Hersholt (the grandfather in Shirley Temple's "Heidi" plays the villain here. And Bela Lugosi plays -- what else -- a vampire! And thankfully has only 5 lines in the whole film.And, in the end, after suffering through this hour, you'll discover it's not really a horror film at all. A surprisingly plot twist that makes one want to retch.I've never given a film this rating before. 1...and only because you can't give a zero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mark of the Vampire may have lavish MGM production values and Bela Lugosi reprising his vampire shtick, but it's all too typical hackwork from Tod Browning. Unlike his Dracula, this moves at a lightning pace ? too fast, in fact, for us to ever get involved in the characters or plot or for it to conjure up any atmosphere ? but still manages to be dull and uninvolving, with the typical 30s trick ending just adding to the general air of disappointment. The main remaining point of interest is Lionel Barrymore's performance, which seems to have served as a template for every vocal inflection and mannerism Jack Nicholson has inflicted on unfortunate audiences for the past quarter of a century since giving up acting for panto.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first 80% of the film looks like a ripoff of the 1931 Dracula, but it offers a twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For most of the film, it looks like a blatant rip-off of the classic 1931 version of Dracula. There are just too many parallels to list them all, but the story looks like the other in so many ways it was obvious they were trying to capitalize on the previous film's success. Characters nearly identical to Nina Harker and Dr. Von Helsing are present in this film as well. About the only major differences about the first 80% of the film is the addition of an odd-looking female vampire, the storyline about the dead father and the fact that you don't get to see all that much of Lugosi and he only talks at the end of the film.Now the final portion of the film is truly odd and although nothing on IMDb would substantiate it, I really think that the plot was re-tooled at the last minute and the final 20% was NOT the originally planned script. Studio lore is that only the producer/writer and director knew about the plot twist and kept it from the actors all along in order to get a more effective job of acting. I really doubt this is true because some of the first section of the film seems to contradict the last portion--in particular, that amazing scene where the lady vampire has sprouted wings and flies. This is NOT adequately explained away in the final scene, nor are some of the other aspects of the film. Some may like the way the film went at the end, I really didn't because of these contradictions.Still, despite this, the film is highly entertaining and fun to watch. In many ways this MGM film looks exactly like the Universal version of Dracula, except that there were a lot more bats in this latter film--particularly the ones that are fake, huge and barely flap their wings when they fly!ONLY READ THIS IF YOU ARE 100% SURE YOU DON'T MIND READING A MEGA-SPOILER: Jean Hersholt plays Baron Otto. Ironically, it turns out in the end he is the evil murderer. Why is this so ironic? Well, due to his efforts to help starving actors down on their luck in real life, the Oscar people (AMPAS) created the "Hersholt Humanitarian Award" to recognize actors for their community service contributions!! Talk about playing "against type"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is "classic" only in that it is dated. In all fairness, it holds up somewhat well in comparison to other movies released that year. (1935) However, this movie IS a "classic" in its representation of what happens to a film that the artistic rights are held by studio bosses interested in only numbers. At 60 minutes running time, I am sure that this film would be greatly improved by the replacement of its lost 27 minutes.Beyond that, this is an early remake of the lost film "London After Midnight" with all of its absurd plot twists and much discussed "surprise" ending. (Which in my book really stank.) If old fashioned B/W Hollywood Gothic is your thing, then this one is a 8. Other wise, its a 1. That's a 4 1/2 average. (But its a LOW average.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mark of the Vampire is set in a Hungarian village where Sir Karell Brotoyn (Holmes Herbert) has been found dead, drained of blood &amp; with two puncture wounds on his neck. Inspector Neuman (Lionel Atwill) from Prague is on the case but he has a hard time getting anything from the locals apart from superstitious nonsense about Vampires. Neuman calls in Vampire expert professor Zelin (Lionel Barrymore) to try &amp; convince the locals that the death of Sir Borotyn wasn't anything to do with a Vampire (if that makes any sense) but Zelin becomes convinced that Vampires are at work &amp; the sinister Count Mora (Bela Lugosi) who lives in a run down castle &amp; only comes out at night is right at top of his list of suspects. Sir Borotyn's daughter Irena (Elizabeth Allan) appears to fall under the spell of a Vampire &amp; when her Father is seen walking around even Inspector Neuman has to consider the possibility that a Vampire may be turning the locals into the undead...Co-produced &amp; directed by Tod Browning I thought Mark of the Vampire was a decent little film that plays quite well even today. The script by Guy Endore &amp; Bernard Schubert plays like a cross between a horror &amp; murder mystery with equal amounts of screen time given to both &amp; at times it seems like it can't make up it's mind what it wants to be. At only 60 odd minutes long it certainly has a nice pace to it, it never becomes boring &amp; it doesn't outstay it's welcome. I would guess that most people who have seen Mark of the Vampire remember it for it's twist ending, we have become used to clever twist endings recently with The Sixth Sense (1999) &amp; Fight Club (1999) being two excellent examples although I'm not so sure how common or popular they were in 1935 &amp; I think it would be interesting to know just how audiences reacted to it back then. Anyway, I quite liked the ending for what it was &amp; even though it wasn't totally plausible it rounded things off nicely &amp; worked pretty well. The character's &amp; dialogue seem stiff when viewed today but that's probably just because of the period in which it was made as much as anything else.Director Browning apparently made Mark of the Vampire as a remake to his own London After Midnight (1927) which is now regarded as a 'lost' film, so I guess the idea of a remake isn't a modern one? There are some nice creepy scenes in Mark of the Vampire, shots of Count Mora walking down the stone staircase in his cobweb strewn, run down castle is a great image as are foggy graveyards &amp; the like. Unfortunately several of these shots are ruined by the most fake looking rubber bat ever, the filmmakers probably did what they could with the funds &amp; technical ability available but the fake bats &amp; spiders really kill any atmosphere &amp; credibility Browning had managed to create, a shame.The budget for Mark of the Vampire was apparently $305,177 which seems like a strangely random amount to me, anyway it's well made with some nice sets, good black &amp; white cinematography &amp; the acting is a little hammy by some while too stiff &amp; forced by other's, it's a mixed bag basically.Mark of the Vampire is an effective chiller from the 30's, many will be put off by it's age &amp; the things that mean like no bad language, no blood or gore, no sex, not shot in colour &amp; no major Hollywood stars. However, if these things don't worry you then Mark of the Vampire is definitely worth an hour of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lionel Barrymore was probably drunk during most of the filming; he certainly seemed to be. His approach to delivering his lines consisted of suddenly finding meaning in the words he memorized as he delivered them -- my God, what horrible acting! His lousy work made it very difficult for everyone else on the set to get into their characters. You can see them waiting for Barrymore to pound out his lines unconvincingly, and then try to figure out how to make their own lines sound plausible. Bela Lugosi was on autopilot the whole time he was in vampire mode. The editing was execrable. You may say, "Hey, it wasn't Tod Browning's fault," but I say, "Hey, all we've got to go by is what wound up on the screen, and it's a mess!" The script, or what survived of it, is a steaming pile of clichés. Lordy, what a waste of an hour.</fullReview>

Tod Browning's remake of his very own London After Midnight is deadly dull without any energy or life going for it. With Lionel Barrymore, Lionel Atwill and Bela Lugosi you'd expect something to be going on but nothing ever does. Barrymore is too over the top, Atwill is the most interesting thing and Lugosi is decent for the time he's on screen. A lot of people talk about the ending but it was the same in the original version. I actually get more entertainment out of watching the photo reconstruction of the original film.</fullReview>
