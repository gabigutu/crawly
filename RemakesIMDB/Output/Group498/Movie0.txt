		<shortDescription>An Effective Sci-Fi Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be an effective thriller, a sci-fi film absolutely must impart to the viewer a sense of --- coldness, either the physical coldness of outer space or other worlds, or the emotional coldness of science.Cedric Hardwicke's opening narrative in "The War Of The Worlds" is brutally cold, and the added images uninviting. The martian machines, vaguely resembling "legless swans", are both beautiful and terrifying. They move slowly, in a graceful but calculating manner. They warn of their approach with an eerie, unearthly "pinging" sound.In the scene where the priest walks toward one of the "swans", the aliens do not impulsively open fire. Instead, they wait. The cruel "eye" peers down on the priest, studying him, in a foreboding prelude to his inevitable annihilation.Other scenes in the first half also convey this needed sense of alien coldness. We can, therefore, forgive the film for its somewhat corny plot.The film's second half is weaker because the aliens have to compete for screen time with Los Angeles mob scenes, a showy and irksome display of American military hardware, and dry narration of military war tactics. But even in this second half, suspense filters through, as we watch the heartless "swans" eject their heat rays on a helpless Los Angeles.For sci-fi films made before "2001: A Space Odyssey", "The War Of The Worlds" is one of my three favorites, along with "Robinson Crusoe On Mars" and "Forbidden Planet".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhere out in the American West, a huge meteor-like projectile crashes in the soil. Everyone initially believes it to be nothing more than a meteor, but soon all learn it is really an investigative ship from the planet Mars out to destroy anything and everything in its path. This film directed by Byron Haskin, based on a script by Barre Lyndon, and produced by George Pal is one of the quintessential science fiction films of the 50's, otherwise known as the Golden Age of Science Fiction. Based on the novel of the same name by H. G. Wells, this film keeps the spirit of the book intact while changing some things like the setting. The book takes place primarily in and around London. All of the talents in this film help make The War of the Worlds an innovative, intelligent, and evocative film that tries to get one thinking about alien invaders and their intentions. The earthlings in this film are the good ones...trying to be friendly, yet, treated as nothing more than impediments in the Martians' way. So many scenes in this film are strong: the army fighting the Martian space ship while a man of God tries to make peace with the strangers, the old farmhouse, and the ending as the aliens attack Los Angelos. Acting is strong too as leads Gene Barry - doing a very good job as a scientist who just happens to be nearby - and Ann Robinson convincingly portray what life might be like in a world with such horrific news. But despite a first-rate script, solid direction from Haskin, and good acting, The War of the Worlds owes its greatest debt to producer George Pal. Pal knew how to put films like this together and was a driving force in the film's innovative and unique special effects. Who could forget those bright green Martian ships or that figure of a Martian?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One word describes this classic - VIVID</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For it's day; and, even this day, this is classic, almost perfect, masterpiece. Brilliant design work on the alien ships, incredible sound effects, and sharp, vivid colors. Pacing in this film is tight, and Barry's performance as a scientist in giddy awe of the alien's capabilities is masterful. Finally, the realism of the story telling is unrivalled in most modern science fiction films. All right, it's not true to Wells' original, but what's wrong with updating the story, especially when it is this effective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a classic after 50 years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is easily one of the Top Ten of the Sci-Fi genre. Producer George Pal and director Byron Haskin certainly reached a creative plateau back in 1953 that is seldom attained even now in the current age of CGI effects and ear-splitting soundtracks.I was lucky to attend the 50th anniversary screening in Hollywood recently, with Gene Barry, Ann Robinson, other actors and production people from the film, and 'Mr. Sci-Fi' Forrest J. Ackerman, all in attendance. To see it on a full size theater screen for the first time, and with these people there, was the thrill of a lifetime, for sure!The Martians and their war machines in this movie are still some of the best and most memorable designs in the history of science fiction films. The color cinematography and musical score also hold up very well. And any film that starts off with the beautiful space art paintings of Chesley Bonestell has my vote of approval. Also, Jack Northrup's Flying Wing bomber puts in a splendid cameo appearance.Simply the best 'alien invasion' type film ever made - bar none!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HG Wells' futuristic novel responds well to the Technicolor splashed on it in this 50s B classic. Gene Barry over emotes in the lead now and then but the martian invasion is handled very well and the tension rises to the final scenes where the surviving populace huddle in the church as the buildings crash and burn around them.'War of the Worlds' deserves its place as both a highly regarded novel and a well-remembered movie. Byron Haskin and George Pal did a great job in visualising the apocalyptic bits of Wells' text, while still making the end result enjoyable and interesting for the viewer.Recommended for fans of intellectualised science fiction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cheesy, Yes! But...Probably the creepiest and most horrifying scenes in Filmdom was when the Martian crept up behind our heroine and clamped its tarsier-like fingers on her shoulder.She freaked, but not immediately. She paused. Reacted to that touch. Slowly turned her head around and LOOKED at the offending appendages.This entire moment of horror and violation took about four to six seconds. Her mind - finally - comprehended it. IT had touched her.Then she lost it. One of the best screams in film history. Great acting and just overwhelming. For that one scene, I love this movie. Creepy as hell!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Pal redeems himself after the appalling special effects from "When Worlds Collide" by giving us one of the best science fiction movies from the 1950's. Without the use of Industrial Light &amp; Magic or THX, George Pal created the near-perfect illusion of flying swan-like Martian machines attacking the Earth. (Near-perfect because you can faintly see the wires) Ann Robinson gives a BRILLIANT performance as "The damsel in distress". Sandro Giglio (from "When Worlds Collide") returns as one of the scientists. Also Leith Stevens returns from "When Worlds Collide" to provide the music. You'll notice too that some of the footage from this movie comes from "When Worlds Collide". I must add...look for George Pal &amp; Byron Haskins as the hobos listening to the radio.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though this is not a literal translation of the H.G. Welles classic, this is still a good film. I especially loved how it was updated to the 20th century and that all our modern weapons, including the atom bomb, couldn't destroy the Martians. George Pal is definitely one of the most underrated directors of science fiction and this film along his When Worlds Collide and The Time Machine stand out among the great science fiction films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Decided to view this film which has been showing on TV for a very long time and enjoyed the great efforts of the director to create a great Classic Sci-Fi Film. Gene Barry (Dr. Clayton Forrester),"Burke's Law,TV Series, '63, gave a great performance hiding behind some rather large framed glasses. Ann Robinson,(Sylvia Van Buren),"Imitation of Life",'59 gave a great supporting role and helped Dr. Forrester try to defeat the invading enemy from another planet. This is a great Classic film from the 1950's, however, I am very glad that our films industry has progressed since this flick. I never thought we would ever see just what the enemy looked like and the ending of the film will surprise you to NO END!!! KEEP PRAYING!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 1953 Paramount version of the H.G. Welles classic is story is a minor masterpiece of the sci-fi genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A number of commentators here have registered complaints, making what I think are unfair comparisons of the film to much later and more technically sophisticated movies, and to Welles' original short novel. I intend to address some of these issues here. BEWARE, SPOILERS AHEAD.The screenplay by Barré Lyndon updates and relocates the story to rural California in 1953, where a supposed meteorite crashes to earth near a small town. The choice of a modern day American location versus the original late Victorian England was made partly for budgetary reasons, staging a mass exodus from Los Angeles was certainly easier for a Hollywood studio to manage than an evacuation of London. However, updating the action to the age of nuclear weapons allowed the besieged Earthlings to confront the Martian invaders with a much more powerful array of weapons than anything dreamed of in 1898. Thus when the alien fighting machines prove invulnerable even to the most advanced nuclear explosives it is much more effective visually and dramatically than if they were being fired upon by the small and relatively crude horse-drawn cannons featured in the original story.The central character is Dr. Clayton Forrester (Gene Barry), evidently a physicist with a major California-based university, who fills in the role given to the unnamed narrator of the original story. By making him a scientist the screenplay is able to economize on characters whose only job is to provide exposition, Forrester can be both the object of the viewer's sympathies and can instantly explain some of the more dramatic elements of Martian military technology, such as the fighting machines, which rather than flying actually walk on invisible legs of magnetic force, and the devastating anti-meson plasma weapon. The narrator of the original story has to rely on extraneous characters or post-invasion scientific analysis of Martian technology to supply similar important information to the reader. Dramatically the movie's solution is more satisfying since the references in Welles' text to post-war scholarship telegraph the ending (i.e. human civilization survives) whereas the movie version could have ended with mankind's extinction without internal contradiction. One particularly satisfying point about Forrester character is, brilliant as he is, he is not the lone authority with all the answers ? he is part of a highly respected team of scientists from many disciplines who jointly tackle the problem of alien invasion.Providing the romantic foil, which Hollywood always deems to be necessary in sci-fi films, is Sylvia Van Buren (Ann Richards), a graduate in Library Science (the most misnamed academic discipline ever). She has no parallel in the Welles text except perhaps the narrator's wife, who is only referred to obliquely and has no dramatic role except as an object of longing. Sylvia is mostly ornamentation, but she does provide emotional counterweight to Forrester's cool intellectualism and curiosity.The original story has two important secondary characters, the artilleryman and the curate. Welles uses both as vehicles for his social commentary, employing the artilleryman as a symbol of a reformed European society (i.e. a rational, scientific meritocracy without class distinctions) while the curate functions to show the weakness of religiosity in the face of mortal peril (Welles was an avowed atheist). Not only is his curate is a despicable coward; he is also a parasite who endangers his fellow humans. The artilleryman comes off somewhat better, but he is shown to be lazy dreamer rather than a true visionary, perhaps this is Welles' veiled criticism of the socialist agitators of his day who offered themselves as spokesmen for the working class yet were notably shy of personal experience as workers themselves.The movie has no parallels to the curate and the artilleryman, except for Sylvia's uncle Mathew, the minister of a local church. In keeping with George Pal's religious optimism (faith is always a central and positive force in his body of work) Uncle Mathew offers hope and kindly guidance to his flock in the face of imminent war, helping to organize and comfort the townspeople. He also shows a remarkable curiosity about the alien invaders ? an unexpected and refreshing take on the clergy considering the usual Hollywood stereotype.Much as been made about the fighting machines as a regrettable deviation from Welles' animated tripods. Personally I think the gliding metallic manta rays (designed by master prop artist Albert Nozaki) are an improvement. When Welles pictured his tripods he evidently didn't work out how they would move. When the movie was in preproduction the tripod concept was discarded as unworkable and visually unimpressive, even comical. Granted the supporting wires are too obvious and distracting in many scenes (perhaps with a larger budget they could have been matted out), yet their stately, inexorable movement and scanning swans necks do communicate a thoroughly alien technology with no reliance on the concept of the wheel, a point Welles makes in his narrative. UPDATE -- I have since learned that the original theatrical release prints using the Techicolor process effectively masked fighting machine support wires, ergo more kudos to "War of the Worlds". I've never seen this film in Techicolor, unfortunately. This makes me long for a re-mastered DVD or Blu-Ray which has the wires obscured digitally. My final point is the appearance of the Martians themselves. In Welles' conception the Martians are essentially body-less heads, which make and use mechanical substitutes as needed. In place of arms and hands they have tentacles. From the standpoint of a Victorian layman's thinking influenced by Darwinism, the idea of evolution producing giant brains without a supporting suite of organs might be tenable. However, more advanced research would tend to discard that notion. The movie Martians are a much more alien and more plausible with their functional bodies, three-fingered (and thumb-less) hands, and their remarkable tripled-lensed eyes.Overall I give the movie high marks. It has little of the social commentary of Welles' novel, but it is better sci-fi, a pioneering work in the context of its times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Towers Over The Remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead;The acting is so superior to the original especially Dr. Forrester compared to Tom Cruise. Even Sylvia is a better actress than anyone in the remake. Many younger people may avoid this film because they are going to be afraid the effects will stink. No, believe it or not, this features the best effects of any movie before 1970. The effects are so excellent that the people who did Robinson Crusoe on Mars stole these space ships. They show little beams that hold the ships in the air magnetically, very well done. Watch this cast convey fear versus the newer bad actors. It contains one of the scariest scenes in any movie. I will not spoil it for you just get ready to see popcorn go flying all around your living room. The remake, wisely, did not even try to mimic it. It will seem a little corny and phony with the square dance, and the community activities but it really was like that. When I was growing up, it was a world of parks, activities and communities, just like it is depicted here. They wiped it all out before I could really be a part of it. Watch, compared to Independence Day, how no time is spent trying to communicate with them. In Independence Day, even after they wipe out half the country, the president is still trying to cut a deal. Like all science fictions from the 50s, with the exception of the Space Children, we lock and load. Some people get offended at the priest getting burned up, hey, these are stand ins for the godless Commies. That scene was necessary to relay to the audience, that the enemy is always godless and ruthless. It will seem so odd, like Earth Versus The Flying Saucers, how we start firing with no attempt to negotiate. Find a movie of this genre in the 50s where we did. It has some really creepy parts in it. The movie is quite short which is a good thing. It gets going and never stops until the ending. There is a hiding out in the farmhouse scene but that is why the director put the scariest scene in there; you think it is boring then BAM!, he scares the crap out of you. Acting is important in horror or science fiction because the premise is so far fetched we need believability out of the actors. This cast will not let you down. I know, there is an intentionally funny part with the radio guy freaking everybody out about the invaders. Look, there are always parts like this in old movies, try not to notice. It is not as funny as Dr. Marvin putting that alien helmet on in Earth Versus The Flying Saucers. A Great Movie, the best the 50s had to offer with Forbidden Planet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, it's not an adaptation of the H.G. Wells book. If it's supposed to be, it's horrendous...BUT taken as a sci-fi film from the 50s, it's tremedous. The dialogue is corny and the acting is beyond belief (did anyone tell Gene Barry not to move a muscle in his face?), but the special effects are incredible. Some are pretty obvious (love it when the spaceship crashes into what is obviously a paper mache building!) but the majority of them stand up even today. I had the good luck to see a newly struck print and the color was superb and I've never seen the film look so good! This movie scared the hell out of me as a kid...as an adult it doesn't (of course) but it's still a heck of a lot of fun! This is 20 times better than that piece of crap "Independence Day". "ID" had cardboard characters, REALLY stupid dialogue (much worse than this movie) and stunning gaps of logic (Will Smith learning in 3 seconds how to fly an alien spacecraft; A COMPUTER VIRUS??????). This one doesn't. A true classic. See it!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fantastic Classic of the Sci-Fi Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Mars invades Earth with lethal war machines, neither the army nor the scientists are able to stop the invaders. However, the influenza virus succeeds where even the most powerful weapon developed by men, the atomic bomb, fails.A couple of days ago I went to the movie theater to see the 2005 version of "The War of the Worlds". I am not fan of remakes, but I really expected a great movie, with Steven Spielberg updating this fantastic classic. What a waste of time and money: the Spielberg's version is awful when comparing with this naive classic. The state-of-art special effects of this 1953 movie may seem cheesy in 2005, but they are spectacular indeed. The story is very scary, with the indestructible Martians invaders destroying everything and everybody; the heroine screams in danger situations and looks for the arms of the hero, as usual in the movies of those years; and my only restriction refers to the religious connotation of the end of the film. "The War of the Worlds" is a fantastic classic of the sci-fi genre, better and better than the recent version. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Guerra dos Mundos" ("War of the Worlds")Note: On 16 April 2002 I saw this film.On 05 November 2015 I saw this film again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've loved this movie since I can recall first seeing it as a child. The Martian sound and ship seriously make me smile. I still want to help that Martian in the end. I recommend that you watch it in the dark with a snack as if you were in the movie house for the best viewing and NO talking. I have it on VHS and watch it at least once a year. Gene Barry is a hunk. The female lead is a mix of panic and strength. Still don't know why the Martians were interested in her. The first 3 to die were immigrant, blue collar and white collar-no one was safe. I've sometimes put the VHS in and just listened to it to compare the fear factor to the radio version which I also have. The special effects are great. SG-1 used the philosophy of the force field were the Martians could shoot out of the field but shots could not get in with the Gouald. The SG-1 episode were the "alien" race could walk through walls used a red-blue-green signal that looked very much like the Martian eye. Days prior to writing this review-there was an actual fire ball seen in the sky that looked similar to the first Martian ship entering the atmosphere. These references show how much influence this movie has and there's more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An even better 50's movie than the Forbidden Planet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The War of the Worlds starring Gene Barry has the benefits of solid acting and an excellent plot. The actors are always believable, actually allowing their own personal tension and understanding of the catastrophe facing them to build as the plot unfolds before the viewer. In the wrong hands even the brief appearance of the Martians could have deteriorated into almost slapstick comedy but instead the director only allowed us to see flashes of the aliens rather than dwelling on them. Indeed, this was both necessary and effective, since the special effects, the spaceships, and even the Martians themselves were only props to give meaning and body to the real narrative. That narrative of course is classic, human beings facing a problem to which they have no solution, not even their wits and knowledge can save them. Their salvation must and does come from outside of them, presumably from the hands of God, since the moment of the Martians doom occurs while the movies focus is on Gene Barry finding his companion in a church full of people praying. I thought this movie was indeed great as an action film full of excellent special effects, but the movie was even greater in the way it explored the dilemma of human powerlessness and the power of faith.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being quite a sci-fi fan for many years, I have seen hundreds of science fiction movies. In my opinion, this is the best ever. War of the Worlds is the only movie I can watch again and again, never get tired of, and always find something new every time I see it.The special effects are brilliant. The alien aircraft are terrifying, and the cobra-like appearance and sounds of the heat ray are awesome indeed. I first saw this movie as a youngster and was absolutely in awe of the realism of the alien invasion. Now a gray-haired old coot, I still feel some of that awe every time I see this film.What should we expect if we are invaded by beings with technology capable of carrying an invasion force across space? Independence Day answers the question one way - War of the Worlds provides a different answer. You'll just have to watch it to see if we win.My final thought on this classic film is that the acting is superb. Everyone is bigger than life: the scientist; the student; the general; the colleagues; the priest. I thank them for taking so seriously this far-fetched tale of a Martian invasion.Superb science fiction movie. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

Intense special effects for it's day and featuring a realistic approach to how to handle an alien invasion. The writers of ID4 must have been influenced by this one.This movie moves fast as US military forces quickly realize their obselecence vs the superior Martian technology. Humans begin giving up the fight and are all but ready to surrender to the onslaught. Then, the suprise ending ID4 chose to modify for todays standards.The movie keeps well inline with the book, I think the only major discrepency is that the Aliens didn't use Chemical weapons in the movie.

		<fullReview>I saw this movie as a kid in the 1950s and have watched it perhaps ten times since. Today was that tenth time. A Saturday afternoon free, a bag of popcorn ready, it seemed like the right time to be a kid again for an hour or two. But instead I watched the movie through the eyes of an adult--could not help it. It amazes me that I can still watch The War of the Worlds with a fresh eye after so many previous viewings and still enjoy it. More than ever, the sheer skill with which this movie was made is remarkable.The direction, writing, special effects, and good acting combine to make a story whose excitement and sense of wonder never let up. The scene at the pit, when the three men deputized to stand guard watch as the Martian ray machine rises from the pit, is pure movie magic. Nothing like it for eeriness.Science fiction rarely looks at characters in depth, and that is true in this movie as well; still, the characters in this film, even the minor ones, have distinctive traits and are interesting to watch.A lifelong science fiction enthusiast, I have seen many, many films in the genre. No movie is ever perfect, but I give this movie a ten because I think it is the best SF movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome for it's time. WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE WAR OF THE WORLDS (1953) remains one of the most important sci-fi offerings of all time. Although it doesn't have some of the additional terror of the novel (the sequences in the book in which Londoners flee up from the West End from the toxic canisters the tripod war machines are throwing are quite amazing for the time they were written), the film has some great action and some masterful suspense.Admittedly today, some elements are questionable. I doubt if anybody would suggest picnic tables and have a crowd gather around a meteor when it clearly is radioactive, but the first appearance of the heat ray out of the meteor after it unscrews is still freaky today, and the first standoff between the Martian machines and the military is spectacular. The effects deservedly won an Oscar in 1953.One of the film's strengths is the use of Technicolor. Certainly if you watch the DVD version which is the original 1.33:1 ratio, the colours are striking and really enhance the effects of the film. The opening voiceover narration is classic and I can imagine that when this was first seen on the big screen at the time of the original release, it must have had people enthralled as the events of the film unfolded.The performances are clearly more suggestive of a B movie than a Hollywood studio release, but hold the film reasonably together, but first and foremost, this is a classic sci-fi effects extravaganza which should be discovered by new audiences and generations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The George Pal-Byron Haskin production of War Of the Worlds is none too faithful to the H.G. Wells novel it's based on, yet it's an excellent movie in its own right. Filmed in Technicolor, it jumps off the screen even today, and features special effects that have worn the years remarkably well. It's a period piece, for sure, but an accomplished one, with nicely imagined Martian landing craft, and some exceptionally spooky-looking tentacled creatures. Gene Barry, in horn-rimmed glasses, is solid as the lead, and the rest of the cast is competent. There's a real edge in this one, with people fleeing left and right as the Martians gradually extend their power. Producer Pal and director Haskin made a fine team, and would work together again. Their science fiction movies are quite different from most others of the period, as they brought a touch of class and style to everything they did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intellects Vast, Cool, and Unsympathetic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a strange movie. For one thing, the lead scientist (Gene Barry) is allowed to wear eyeglasses, which at the time was considered demasculinizing. For another, we don't emerge from the interplanetary conflict victorious. We don't discover that the Martians dissolve in salt water or are allergic to second-hand smoke or peanuts. They die alright, but not because of -- but rather despite -- our every effort to eliminate them, including a nuclear bomb. For another, in some way this is a rarity -- a film that's an improvement over the book it's based on.H. G. Wells' novella had aliens landing all over England and building cylindrical walking tripods to use as "fighting machines." People were not just killed by their main weapon, "black smoke," but were eaten as well. And, as we should expect from a socialist like Wells, religion is just about absent from the book. The narrator DOES encounter a churchman but he goes mad and is eaten.The film is smoother, splashier, and easier to follow for non-British audiences who might not know West Wokking from Stoke-on-Trent. And the flying -- or rather the GLIDING -- fighting machines are a vast improvement over Wells' giant, stumbling cylinders. These machines here are really creepy. And, although the Martians don't seem to eat anybody, they destroy everything and everybody in sight. We get barely a glimpse of them, just enough to know they are bipedal and bilaterally symmetrical, with suction cups on the ends of their three fingers, which, it has to be admitted, is a little outré. I mean, where do they live -- perched on smooth walls? Come to think of it, they lack a thumb too. That puts them in the same category as Mickey Mouse, doesn't it?Gene Barry is the stalwart scientist. There is a girl in it for no particular narrative reason. When everyone is trying to escape Los Angeles before it is destroyed, two trucks and a bus are packed with electronic equipment that might be pieced together in such a way as to check the Martians' advance. Yet when the vehicles try to leave, they are confiscated by a hysterical mob. The mob throws out the scientists and their equipment and take off for parts far away. The mob members who knew what they were doing (if any of them knew) were in an interesting position called a "social trap." If you were in a position to save (1) all mankind or (2) your own lily-livered butt, which would you choose? The religious element of the film probably has H. G. Wells spinning in his grave. Right off the bat, the beautiful young girl's uncle Mathew is a minister who tries to communicate with the creatures, tremulously approaches one of the machines, holding a Bible and reciting a familiar Psalm. ZAP. Barry's young girl friend was abandoned as a child and rescued by the Minister, who found her in a church doorway. There is a lot of ecumenical religious imagery in this film. In the end, with civilization being blasted away and falling down around their ears, the survivors hold each other inside a church -- just as the Martians begin to kick it. A holy choir swells up and the narrator, Cedric Hardwicke, tell us about the bacteria that "God in His wisdom" put upon the earth. I guess everybody would go along with much of that. I'd leave the bacteria alone instead of trying to kill them off by overusing antibiotics to make our cattle fatter and our chickens plumper for the short-term change.At that, the General (Les Tremayne) who sees all military efforts fail, announces that they will now move to the mountains, establish a line of defense, and fight them from there. This is a smart move when a weak opponent faces a technologically superior one. What else can you do? It is what's called "guerilla warfare" and is waged by "freedom fighters" (if they're on our side) or "rebels" (if they're not).I don't mean to suggest any solutions to these kinds of issues, or even that there ARE any solutions, but the movie itself, wittingly or otherwise, manages to raise them in model form. Wells was quite open about it. For him and his contemporaries, the behavior of the invading Martians is an analog of colonialism. Do we have the right to condemn the Martians when we ourselves move into a portion of another continent and claim it as our own? In any case -- ethics or no -- this is a good movie, full of zest and special effects. It's not a masterpiece. There are so few masterpieces, especially in genre movies. But the view is both cogent and satisfying. Watch it, if you haven't already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing For Its Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this the first two times I saw it but on the third, about a year ago - and my first look on DVD - it was disappointing. It seemed to have lost its impact. However, I can still enjoy the story with the re-make which came out in 2005, which I recently watched and enjoyed.For its day - over 50 years ago - I still think this 1953 movie had amazing special-effects. The alien ships still look cool and probably always will. Gene Barry is fine in the lead role and I appreciated the very ending in which God, not man, is given glory for the cessation of violence. This is a movie where people actually pray for help. I didn't see that in the re-make, of course.The thing that finally ruined this film for me was the hysterical woman role played by Anne Franklin. Why they had to have screaming, out-of-control women in these '50s sci-fi film, I don't know. Maybe it was just the demeaning way women were often portrayed in action, crime or sci-fi movies. Nonetheless, she was annoying big-time.Overall, it's a decent film but, at the point, I'll settle to watch the re-make if I want to revisit this Martian invasion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless Classic but Dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several reviewers pointed out that the spaceship "wires" can be seen in the DVD copy. This movie needs to be "restored" again so those pesky wires can be computer-edited out. (I wish I had not read that, as now I can "see" them too!) It makes the scenes much less effective. Otherwise, very good efx for 1953. Good (12 ft.tall) "minatures" and mattes. Effective use of puppetry for the Martians. What doesn't work: splicing b/w stock footage into a color movie. Unintentionally funny dialog. That terrible wig and flawless make-up on "Sylvia". The reporters at the press conference don't seem excited or scared enough, considering we are fighting monstrous aliens! Still, this movie is enjoyable in spite of its faults. Was it an all-white cast as it has been suggested? No. Some of the "extras" and "soldiers"are p.c. A good, tight movie with only a few minutes of "slowness" in the action. The invaders die in the end because of Earth's bacteria; the exact same premise used in the movie version of "First Men in the Moon", which is also based on an H.G. Wells story. Outstandingly vivid Technicolor, with a nightmarish quality to it. Is this the best Sci-Fi thriller ever made? No, but its in my top 10 list of must-see sci-fi features. Great DVD extras for a 1-disc: Good "making of" 29 min. feature and the "War of the World's" Orson Welles radio "broadcast". Original trailer. Should be PG. No gore but too intense for very little kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Decent 50's Sci-Fi Movie, But Somewhat Dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the few times when I've been glad that Hollywood decided to remake a "classic" movie. It's not that I thought this one was bad. It did, however, come across as very typical of the 1950's, and therefore very dated. It's a good story, and so it did need an update. Standing on its own, this movie had both strengths and weaknesses. On the negative side first, the acting didn't come across as particularly noteworthy. Neither of the leads - Gene Barry as Dr. Forrester and Ann Robinson as Sylvia - really took command of this in my view. The story also had a few too many "cornball" moments. Just a couple: the happy coincidence that a group of scientists just happened to be fishing in the same area where the first Martian spacecraft landed, and the decision of Dr. Forrester to head off with Sylvia to a square dance shortly after. I was also disappointed that the movie didn't open with one of the better parts of the H.G. Wells story: the sighting of strange explosions on the surface of Mars that leads to suspense right off the top. Going right into the Martian landings (even though they were thought at first to be perhaps asteroids) seemed to be jumping into things too fast. On the scientific side of things, as the movie opened with a survey of the planets in our solar system and why only Earth was hospitable for the Martians, it became clear that someone should have checked some simple facts: it's declared that Jupiter is the closest planet to Mars when Earth is actually a lot closer to Mars than Jupiter.On the positive side, the Martian ships are wonderfully portrayed, and I appreciated that this never became a "monster" movie. There are only a couple of very brief glimpses of the Martians themselves, which increased the sense of mystery about them. The movie establishes a real sense of hopelessness. After absolutely everything has been thrown at the Martians they're still going, and if you didn't know how the story ends, you'd wonder how they're possibly going to be stopped. As an adjunct to that, there are some very believable scenes of panic and looting as the Martian onslaught continues.It's a decent 50's sci-fi effort, but it's also a very 50's sci-fi effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast-paced, professional, thoroughly American '50s sci-fi shocker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why does film work? Schmaltz drips, the schlock never stops, the characters are two dimensional, the acting frequently over the top, the dialog corny - all as noted by other reviewers. Yet the film works. Why.First, a word about the special effects: they may not meet todays CGI "3-D" standards, but even when not entirely believable, they remain visually impressive. And Los Angeles (a personality-less city lacking a memorable skyline) always looks best when it's getting destroyed.Second, the pacing: It's just about perfect, with an intense drive that never goes out of control. When confronted by the schmaltz or a line of corny dialog, we aren't given the chance to smirk or cringe, we're pushed into the next moment, on the edge of our seats to see what happens next, even when we know what happens next. There are plenty of shocks and chases and explosions to keep us from noticing the film's weaknesses while watching it.Finally, about the characters: as noted, 2-dimensional. Unfortunately, most Americans just happen to be 2-dimensional, and the shrewd Pal (who actually tried for a higher aesthetic in his early animation shorts) quite rightly presents characters that are very much like his intended audience, thus increasing the paranoia-derived fear of the alien and of total destruction that, curiously and unfortunately, Americans so enjoy that most of our heartland culture is built around it.Being American, I'm not happy admitting that; but understanding it allows me to both enjoy the film and recognize its brilliant craftsmanship. Pal and his cast and crew do exactly everything right to produce the intended results. And the film remains a small but important monument to a kind of Hollywood professionalism we rarely see these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smashing sci-fi film that is a landmark for special effects.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martians invade Earth with total destructive powers, seemingly unstoppable, mankind must find a way to beat them before all is Lost.In spite of the uproar and considerable success of Orson Welles' 1938 radio adaptation of the H.G Wells novel, War Of The Worlds was a topic that directors were staying well away from. Such high esteemed men like as Cecil B. DeMille &amp; Alfred Hitchcock were mooted to be interested but it always came down to a worry that the special effects needed for the story were too much of a headache. Enter producer George Pal, noted for puppetoon shorts, he managed to sway the big wigs at Paramount that it could indeed be done, and thus the chain of big colour spaceships blasting, sci-fi creatures lurking and blockbuster bums on seats movies began.Directed by Byron Haskin, this version of the source moves the location from Edwardian England to 20th Century America, and this works a treat because the watching American public were genuinely unnerved at the sight of contemporary America being reduced to rubble by an invading force. The makers further our sense of dread by only letting us glimpse the aliens once in a wonderful scene {respectfully homaged in Stephen Spielberg's 2005 version of the source}, other than that scene we are subjected to attack after attack from shiny flying saucers, slick and ground breaking effects working their magic on an impressionable audience.Outside of those known to hardcore sci-fi fans, the cast doesn't contain any stars of note, probably due to all the money being used on the effects? And for sure many of them come across as wooden beyond compare (tho the lovely Ann Robinson lights up every scene she is in), while if I'm to be over critical: then the romantic thread in the film is tiresome and the religious overtone is tardily done. But War Of The Worlds 1953 still stands proud as a brave and hugely enjoyable picture thats importance has never been (nor should it be)understated, and even allowing for nostalgic fervour from this particular viewer, I heartily recommend this film to anyone interested in template movies for the sci-fi genre. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree, Speilbergs remake was a disappointment. Here's what I think was wrong with the movie: 1. The dysfunctional family crap should not have been introduced into a science fiction movie. 2. Who wants to watch a movie with some ill mannered children. I went to see a science fiction movie not a movie about a smart mouth kid and a burnout making their dad's life difficult while he's trying to save their lives. 2. The basement scene with Tim Robbins never seemed to end. The original movie is over 50 years old now but it still a great movie. In the original movie I wanted the characters to survive and triumph over the aliens but with the remake I wanted the movie to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Science-fiction at its best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: One of the first and very best version of H.G. Wells tale of alien invasion. George Pal's adaptation of H. G. Wells "The War of the Worlds" is, without a shed of doubt, the most influential version of the tale. Not only is it highly acclaimed, but also made an unseen mark on Hollywood on how to do sci-fi films. Wells' story have introduced a number of inventive and prophetic material and stories that has forever changed scientists' minds about our future. George Pal, though, has also shared Wells' vision, with his wide imagination and great in-touch sense on the real world. Combining his and the great author's vision, this classic was born. And a vision of grandness it was. Never has the story been shown with mind-ticking interest in this George Pal wonder. Mix an awe sense of wonder, some chilling teeth and a feel of realism, you get a classic, that would set the pattern for many other filmmakers to come.This acclaimed adaptation is followed by many other adaptations, usually with more budget to extend Wells' vision. But only this strikes the mark of being the best. Not only as an adaptation, but also as one of the best films ever made in the genre.Rating: ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed adaptation and a bit dated, but a definite highlight of 50s sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>H.G.Wells' The War Of The Worlds remains a terrifying novel, and two adaptations of it have justifiably passed into popular culture, the Orson Welles radio production in 1938 which convinced many Americans that creatures from Mars actually WERE invading Earth, and Jeff Wayne's 1978 musical album, which still holds up today. The film Independence Day was basically a semi-remake, and of course we are all probably looking forward to the Steven Spielberg version. Somewhat forgotten amongst all those is this 1953 film version, which is a shame. It has considerable flaws, and deviates form the book considerably. However, it's still very enjoyable.One really needs to think how spectacular and darned frightening it must have seemed to 1953 audiences. Films about aliens visiting Earth had up to than been relatively low key, they would have aliens taking human form, or coming in peace, or just taking over a small town. Here, we had aliens intent on just one thing- the complete destruction and extermination of everything and everyone on Earth. Battles between the Martians and the army, Martian death rays frying huge numbers of people, the destruction of Los Angeles, there had been little like it before, and all this on a moderate budget, which is why the cast is strictly B Movie, although they are adequate to the film's needs.Of course to a modern audiences many aspects are dated and may even seem laughable. The sometimes visible wires of the Martian death machines -surely they could have been removed with computer technology for the DVD?. The oft repeated stock shots of the military. The religious element, which would have offended the atheist Welles and even suggests God got rid of the Martians. Some VERY corny dialog.Yet the film has some scenes which are still extremely effective. Most notable is a lengthy sequence in which the hero and heroine are trapped in a house by Martians, this remains genuinely scary. The designs of the briefly seen Martians, their death machines-wires notwithstanding- and their 'cameras' still look great. Of course one misses the huge tripods of the novel, and certain other aspects of the novel, such as the red weed. I'm sure Spielberg will deliver on much of this, even if he is adapting a story which will always be more effective when set in Victorian times. However, until than, this version is still worth seeing as one of the most memorable alien pictures of the 50s alongside The Day The Earth Still and Invasion Of The Body Snatchers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>H G Wells is rightly regarded as the creator of modern science fiction because unlike Jules Verne he was the man who introduced the concept of subtext to the genre , his novels FIRST MEN ON THE MOON and THE TIME MACHINE are really about evolution and class distinctions while WAR OF THE WORLDS is about European imperialism.The film version of WOTW is more simplified and far less interesting than the novel but still contains a subtext , though it's no longer about about European colonialism but about communist aggression . As the film points out several times the invaders rampaging the world come from " The red planet " and being filthy pinko commies they fry a priest , and notice too that the climax takes place outside a church.The film itself has good and bad points . Without doubt the best point is the design of the martian fighting machines , they're not clumsy tripods but flying saucers with a real snazzy snakelike death ray . And the FX are excellent , amazing to think they were conceived 50 years ago and the initial battle scenes are something I remember fondly from my childhood. The most obvious bad points are Gene Barry and Ann Robinson in the leads who show no charisma and watch the scene where they are in the farmhouse and the martian makes its first appearance. What is it doing ? It looks like it's giving a little dance .All in all a fine SF flick but it could never really live up to the groudbreaking book</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to finally seeing this classic in a HD copy on Netflix. Imagine my disgust when finding the lip sync was miles out ? I mean, what is the point?! But this Hollywood hokum looks splendid in a sharp condition whenever it catches up with the sound. It's H. G . Wells' old fashioned story updated for the now old fashioned Post World War 2 Cold War World, when America saw the Soviets everywhere.The Martians dramatically land on Earth to conquer and destroy, the Earthlings naturally resent the intrusion and fight back. The Martians have fabulous fire-breathing space ships protected from the puny American arsenal by invisible "blisters" ? all any successful invaders will really require are locust-like numbers and an impervious religious belief. Gene Barry plays the rather demonstrative hero, full of brainy scientific-type gobbledegook, but it could have been played just as well by Richard Carlson, Warren Stevens, Kenneth Tobey et al; at least he calmed down in later films. Ann Robinson perfectly played the feeble fifties female lead stereotype, her emotive reaction to everything may induce a tightening of the arteries; at least she didn't twist her ankle. The special effects cost a lot but now look less than a little, the screenplay and acting is generally corny, the ending flat but thankfully swift ? however I've loved this film with all its faults since I was young and impressionable. Nowadays a lot of money for cgi cartoonery is thrown at projects like this, but all it results in is a cartoon ? this is intensely simple fare but it's human and relatable to, and will be still be watchable way in the future (assuming human survival) when cold cgi cartoon movies have faded away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All right, here i am again on my "fed up with CGI &amp; remakes" odyssey.I can barely remember the first time i saw this film because i was 5 or 6 years old back then, in the 80's. The thing i remember very well though is that i had nightmares because of this film, waking up in the middle of the night rushing to the windows with apprehensions, great memories!Of course the effects looks dated but the sounds engineering is very effective in my opinion. One thing i like from movies of this era is that everything is straight forward, fast transitions, extra flamboyant dialogues, no fluff, perhaps not enough i might add. The montage and editing seems rushed and rough compare to today's blockbusters but it didn't bothered me at all, i've even found it refreshing and it made me realize once again how generic most of the movies are these days. The acting is a bit stiff but it was totally expected considering the standards of the epoch, everything is black &amp; white including the emotions, no place for ambiguity. Dr. Clayton Forrester (Gene Barry) always have the answer to everything right away, no doubt ever, he knows all and i've found that hilarious and even charming. I had a great time watching this classic and i'm now ready for the 2005 version. That's very big shoes to fill so i have low expectations...In one word: classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Pal's Wild Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Pal's "War of the Worlds" shouldn't work, but it does. Transplanting H.G. Wells' Martian invasion from the English Home Counties, circa 1898, to Southern California, early 1950s, seems ill-advised enough. But larding the story with religious sensibility must have set poor H.G. spinning in his grave. The movie's air of can-do American gumption and prayerful Christianity is about as far from the mental universe of the original novel as can well be imagined. One scene even includes a square dance! But no matter: "War of the Worlds" is good, clean sci-fi fun, happily unencumbered by Earnest Messages or Weighty Philosophical Considerations.My favorite "War of the Worlds" moment comes just before the fighting begins. Observing the Martians' landing zone from a sandbagged bunker, General Mann (Les Tremayne) intones, "They'll probably move at dawn." Never has a film cliché been delivered with such perfect pitch! And sure enough, the fighting begins right on schedule with the incineration by heat ray of the saintly Pastor Collins (Lewis Martin). The troops surrounding the landing zone are routed with great slaughter, and the next thing you know, civilization itself is on the point of collapse. Not even the atom bomb, delivered by the US Air Force's Flying Wing, can arrest the progress of the invasion. In the end, of course, the Martians are defeated?by terrestrial germs, provided courtesy of God's wisdom.The special effects? Okay, there's nothing special there, but their very crudity lends the movie a certain period charm. The acting? Gene Barry, Ann Robinson and the rest of the cast do well enough in their undemanding roles. Don't expect much in the way of character development?like the SF pulps from which it draws inspiration, "The War of the Worlds" isn't too interested in the inner lives of its characters. It's simplistic, sensational, shallow, wide-eyed, unintentionally funny in spots?and isn't that what we sometimes want in a movie? I'll take this one over the elephantine Spielberg/Cruise version any day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From somewhere in outer space, narrator Cedric Hardwicke explains that dying beings from our neighboring plant Mars need a new home, and have chosen to invade Earth. The astronomy review given in the opening narrative couldn't have been acceptable, even for 1953 - Venus had been discovered - so, we know these Martians are a few screws short of the hardware store. Too bad original author H.G. Wells was not around to make corrective suggestions. Anyway, California scientist Gene Barry (as Clayton Forrester) is on vacation near one of the landing sites. At first, he and the town folk think it's a simple meteorite; so, Mr. Barry goes square dancing with beautiful teacher Ann Robinson (as Sylvia van Buren) while the rock cools.Meanwhile, at the landing site, three guards witness the unveiling of a Martian ship. Obviously several noodles short of chow mein, the men decide to wave the universally accepted "White Flag" of peace and advise the Martins, "We're friends! We're friends!" In this opening battle of wits, the Earthlings lose. The Martin ships land all over earth, and wreck the planet while Barry falls in love with Ms. Robinson, and wonders if the Martians have a mortal weakness. It's estimated the Martians will take over Earth in six days; "The same number of days it took to create it," observes Robinson. The special effects are outstanding, especially the design of the Martian spaceship.****** The War of the Worlds (7/29/53) George Pal : Byron Haskin ~ Gene Barry, Ann Robinson, Les Tremayne</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I get it... it's an old movie, and it shows in a lot of the acting and the characters. It was 1953! For its time, it was about as intelligent as any malevolent-alien-flick could be. If you're looking for cinema that's on par with anything they could have made, even a decade later, you will be sadly disappointed. If you watch the film keeping in mind that back in that day, it was difficult to do a flying saucer without seeing the wires, then it's incredible. Remember, this is before wire-removal, green-screen and animatronics (obviously). Every visual effect that was done, needed to be created, and masked, in-camera. Flashes of ray-gun fire needed to be put onto each frame by hand, and done in such a way so that it looked half- plausible, and not jerky. This film absolutely deserved the Oscar it got for visual effects. It also used what scientific information they had at the time (now, much of it proved to be false, but not then) effectively, and to the story's advantage.We've got a winner, here, folks!</fullReview>

Now I read the book myself, and found it to be very interesting about invaders from Mars. It was awesome when the crash-landing of those pods became these alien ships. Those three men waved the flag symbolizing their peace with the beings. So what did they do? They blitzed the men with those rays. So much for peace talks. And the sheriff? He was lucky. His deputy drove off without him, and ended up getting blitzed by the ship. Plenty of science went on in the movie. The power failure, watches getting magnetized after they stopped running. And when the military tried to stop them, they have their force fields to guard them against enemy fire. And the disintegrating rays were unbelievable. I don't think anyone could stand up to that. When you think all hope was lost, the weakness of these martians is the immune system. It's weak! Mankind is saved. Orson Welles did a fine job doing the show, this movie made it a dream come true. I enjoyed it a lot. Really golden to be exact. 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic sci-fi!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is hard to believe this film is 54 years old (nearly) - the special effects are absolutely top-hole - though they aren't exactly 21st century, they are easily a highlight of the era, and easily beat the laughable effects in Jason and the Argonauts (come on, these effects are way better). Men on fire, lasers and nuclear bombs are things that you would only expect to have appeared in cinema in the past 20 years - this film has them - and none of them are badly done. The effects do not look dated, and though there is some cheesy acting, there are no visual flaws - in that aspect, the film is top-hole. Snotty-nosed schoolkids may laugh at it these days, but this film is for people who really appreciate the start of film-making - I'm mostly interested in modern-day films, but this film taught me to appreciate the golden oldies. Though the plot isn't particularly meaty, the script isn't top-hole and the acting not Oscar-winning, it is on the visual scales that this delivers - this has earned way more respect and love than Spielberg's 2005 remake (which was actually way different). Though it starts and ends like a 50's film, the actual film itself make you think whether you are watching something made decades later. The action explodes more than V For Vendetta (which was awful dross), the sound is far better than what we used to get on Top of the Pops and it is on the whole, a brilliant classic of a film - watch it, and see how far things have moved on - or how little, in this case. Absolutely spiffing. Bravo! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1 of the 5 best sifi's of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it first came out in 1953. I was an impressionable 12 years old at the time, and it scared the crap out of me.It was a time to be scared, with the fears of all out atomic war with the Russians, and television public service announcements informing us, not to be near a window, or stay out of the rain if an Atom bomb landed near your home or school. This movie, some say was a metaphor for those times. Sifi movies at that time most always portrayed the aliens as hostile and only interest in destroying or taking over the earth. Today of course the aliens are kinder and gentler. This movie is a gem from beginning to end, from the creepy intro, to the church scene near the end, and certainly the final scene. I remember thinking at the time that maybe that could happen to the Aliens if they in fact did invade. It was a very comforting thought to a 12 year old</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was THE first "space invasion" movie and actually, half a century later, it's still among the best.The plot can hardly be unknown to anyone... meteorites plunge down to Earth, and people flock around them to watch. The meteorites turn out to be pods from Mars though, and soon an all-out war between Man and Martian begins...The effects, are, of course, one of the highlights of the movie. When it came out, it must have blown people away, and even today, in the era of CGI, the effects have an edge few others has produced. Good sound editing works well for the movie too. I beg you, please watch this in context. This was made more than fifty years ago, and if it feels dated, try to turn off the memories from the latest Star Wars or King Kong or whatever CGI-heavy movie you watched recently.The one thing about this movie that feels dated is personalities. The heroine, van Buren, is very damsel-in-distressy, and I doubt there's a single Af-Am person on-screen in the entire movie. This can be a bit frustrating, but as I've said, this was another time.The ending is a bit disappointing, if you're an atheist, but it works as a history document from the time when Americans were all afraid of the Godless commies.One of the better sci-fis out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cadillac of Vintage Sci-Fi Epics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is Heaven for the Sci-Fi enthusiast. Made in the 1950's, during the advent of space exploration, this film exhibits the spirit of that time of speculation, almost with the childlike awe and exuberance of seeing something new.Creative in its depiction of the aliens and their war machines, delightfully ominous in its presentation of the eve of the violence, this pioneer of space-theme movies is well-constructed and well executed in every way.The emerging plot of the invaders is skillfully presented, starting with mysterious meteorites, and permits you to see only one or two new things at a time, allowing the viewer plenty of time to anticipate and wonder at what will transpire next. Even before the unleashing of immense power occurs, the audience has been reeled in, and is ready to fight or flee from the Martians along with the characters.When the violence does erupt (with the symbolic brutal slaying of a priest), the ensuing battle scene is a delicious movie-viewing moment. You really want the army to blast these Martian creatures to kingdom come.The character the audience usually follows (especially after the war begins) is Dr. Clayton Forrester (Gene Barry) who is not just the routine superfluous character (with boring personal problems) of recent horror films, but a scientist who is trying to solve the mystery of how the people of Earth can fight back before they're annihilated. Ann Robinson, as his romantic interest, Sylvia, plays the terrified survivor attempting to escape act with inspired urgency. Her encounter with one of the aliens itself remains one of the classic scream moments in cinematic history.A great supporting cast helps in the endeavor to defeat the Martians. Les Tremayne is an army general, voice talent Paul Frees appears as a radio announcer, Jack Kruschen and Silvio Giglio are colleagues of Forrester, and Cedric Hardwicke does the eerie narration at the beginning of the movie. Lewis Martin is excellent as Sylvia's uncle.George Pal captured the essence of Orson Welles' famous radio play version, and brought it to the big screen with precision. The special effects, showing Martian spaceships, lasers, disintegrations, etc., may be primitive by today's standards, but they remain terrifying and memorable. They far outshine the fx of that recent remake, which were neither interesting nor scary.True movie fans, and true sci-fi genre fans: this is the version you want to see (hey, look at my IMDb name, I should know). It's a movie copied many times, but never matched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Science Fiction at it's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The War of the Worlds Science Fiction with Horror elementsThis is one of Science Fiction's greatest films, and, one of it's greatest stories. Amazing when one considers that it was the first ever alien invasion story! Add to that that this is one of Hollywood's great classic films, it should be pretty easy to go into this believing that we're going to watch something with at least a degree of quality to it.This, of course, is the story of how the creatures from Mars, who looked upon the Earth with envious eyes, sought to invade the planet to revive their own dying race. Simple as that. Every attempt to fight back returns with failure. The slaughter of the human race looks imminent through and through. But as we all are aware, luck may be on the side of man.Here's the breakdown:The Good:--The acting for the most part is pretty good.--For the time, some excellent special effects. Mostly on the alien ships, weapons, and destruction they create.--Fantastic, now classic, sound effects carry the destruction and strange other-worldly feel of the alien vehicles along. --Great music, with one of the better opening/title sequences of the time.--Decent narration.--Follows much of the novel pretty well, though takes a lot of artistic liberties in the characters to settle them in the at-the-time-current ideals of the 1950's.--Great action and atmosphere.--While you watch the movie, keep in mind the fear of Communism that hung over America at the time. That paranoia is present in the film?like most all 1950's SF films.--The boredom which accompanies a lot of 50's era SF films, when they try to explain every detail of everything, is relatively absent here.Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:--Some pretty cheesy writing. This helped speed along the 1950's-era Science Fiction/Alien/UFO movies. It has a feel similar to many of those films, but is generally written much better. --The aliens themselves are a little cheesy looking. Complete with suction cup fingertips. Weird "camera lens" eyes, but good color choice on the skin. Not nearly as wooden, plastery, or overly rubbery like many aliens from this era. So, they're above average for the time. Some subtle details here and there give them some strengths, such as pulsating skin to mimic blood circulating.The Bad:--The first 15 minutes or so are pretty cheesy?both in characters and writing. The opening sequence adds in a now comical look at the "other planets the Martians may have considered before deciding to invade Earth." Science here is barely touched upon?it's mostly wild fantasy. Somehow, Jupiter has become gigantic volcanic nightmare world?which we now know is ludicrous?It's a gigantic gas world, with a theoretically heavily compacted core. It is not a sweltering, rocky landscape of fire and brimstone. This is just one example. Pretty laughable.--No tripods. Instead, the film was made to capitalize on the extremely popular "flying saucer" or "flying disks" which were becoming rampant in the 1950's.The Ugly:--A scene with square dancing!Memorable Scene:--Easily any scene showing the alien crafts moving along firing constantly on anything that moves?and a lot that doesn't.Fun Fact:--The hero is named Clayton Forrester. Fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000 will recognize the name as that of the evil professor with crazy hair and goofy glasses who stuck a man in space to torture him with bad movies.Acting: 8/10 Story: 9/10 Atmosphere: 9/10 Cinematography: 8/10 Character Development: 8/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 10/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 0/10 Violence: 7/10 (a lot of destruction and chaos) Gore: 2/10 (just blood) Dialog: 7/10 Music: 9/10 Direction: 9/10 Cheesiness: 2/10 Crappiness: 0/10Overall: 8/10Quite simply, this is one of Hollywood's best Science Fiction films. Heavy on the science and, rare for the 50's, with a higher than average degree of accuracy. However there are some imperfections grown from newer discoveries through the years. Also, this is rare as a full-color piece from the 50's. Top-notch special effects and sound effects. Great for movie buffs and science fiction fans. Highly recommended.www.ResidentHazard.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The War Of The Worlds is a wonderfully updated (1953) adaption of H.G. Wells' classic book. Many nifty reminders of the fabulous 50's are contained in this exciting movie concerning the invasion of Martians with their war machines. Gene Barry plays a scientist caught up in the invasion from its very beginning in the Southern California countryside. Ann Robinson's character is the small town girl who stays by the scientist's side until the end, and her character proves to be a helpful, female role (unlike many female characters of the genre's films who seem to only be around for decoration and screaming.) SPOILERS: The Martians have landed in the Southern California countryside, and in many other parts of the world. The action in Southern California begins creepy enough, and then turns into an all out war as the indestructible, Martian war machines sweep their way to Los Angeles. We are shown somewhat briefly what has happened when the Martians had begun their destruction on England, France and India. Nothing man has made can stop the protected Martian machines; not even the atom bomb. The destruction of Los Angeles is fascinating, and comes to an abrupt end when the Martians begin to die from our earth's bacteria. The War Of The Worlds contains mostly fine acting. The action is frequent, and the mood the film creates is a mood of almost hopelessness as the Martians seem to be able to conquer all. The film is colorful, classy, and has some grand special effects. I would say The War Of The Worlds would be a major piece to any collector's science fiction film collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whenever you see the name George Pal on a movie you know you are in for a special effects extravaganza and that is exactly what you get in this milestone in Science Fiction cinema history.The story needs little introduction;Martians invade Earth , emerge from their ships and set about destroying anything that stands in their way [including people] only to be killed by an invisible foe.The acting is a little hammy and you will have to hit the volume control when Ann Robinson [playing Sylvia Van Buren] starts to scream,but the special effects dominate the film! [Possible SPOILERS] The scene where the Martian periscope/weapon rises and turns,hissing like a cobra on the three men is Fantastic!-watch it and imagine what it must have been like in a cinema 50 years ago.Likewise, when the Martian ship crashes into the farmhouse and they see the Martian have these scenes ever been bettered? But Pal saves the best for last as the Martians start to raze Los Angeles-one particular part where a Martian machine fires its" ray at a building which then collapses underneath it is quite stunning,together with the poom-poom-poom sound of the death rays. Critics of this movie say "you can see the strings" which is like saying Leonardo Da Vinci missed a stroke or two! Apparently the Martian machine models had a SIX FEET wing span-today they would be CGI, which has no depth or texture and is just visual chewing gum. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original Sci-Fi Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, even though I love Jeff Goldblum and most of its cast members, ID4 is a blatant rip-off of this '50s masterpiece. In the '90s, special effects can be whipped out with hardly any effort at all, but back in 1953, special effects were truly magical and spectacular. The Martian spaceships, shaped like sinister swans are both beautiful and terrifying to behold, and the idea that they used protective "umbrellas" to deflect Earth's arsenal of weapons (including the A-Bomb) is one of the many things that ID4 ripped off. The technicolor is beautiful and vivid on the laser disc version. The cast of unknowns does well. Ann Robinson as the heroine Sylvia Van Buren does her share of screaming in fright, but she has good reason, and she's intelligent and accomplished, not misogynistically represented the way Anne Francis was in FORBIDDEN PLANET (a movie I like just as much). I was also impressed by the clever inclusion of the Martians' biology as a significant plot device.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The one movie I'd choose if I could have only one...the Original, of course. I've watched this classic more times than I can count. Considering when it was made (1953) the special effects are exceptional. To this day some of the scenes still creep me out. For example, near the beginning when the "snorkle" part of the alien ship pokes out of the meteor and looks around 360 degrees. All you hear is the pulsating sound it makes. The director, Byron Haskin, really knew how to build suspense; he makes it easy to believe the Martians will quickly win this war. And considering so many films during this decade were filmed in black &amp; white, kudos to Haskin for choosing Technicolor. I think a lot of impact would have been lost without color. In my opinion this is one of the top three sci-fi films EVER made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...as noted in other posts, those Martian deathship-suspending wires were not visible in the visual design of the film when first released in 1953.There are some historical film purists who would be against tampering in any way with the original film -- for example, by digitally erasing those pesky wires.But as mentioned elsewhere, this film was shot in Technicolor -- the resolution and color contrast of the original Technicolor prints effectively disguised the wires.Since it's unlikely that Paramount Home Video will ever strike new Technicolor prints -- doubtful that would even be possible now, Technicolor being pretty much out of business -- the next best thing would be to use digital technology (and/or correcting the color contrast) to restore the film to its original appearance: with no wires visible.The 1953 film version of The War of the Worlds certainly deserves such a restoration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1898 H.G. Wells wrote one of the most influential and well-known books of all time. In 1938 Orson Welles delivered an amazing radio broadcast based on said book that terrified millions. And in 1953 George Pal and Byron Haskin created an incredible film version that is as timeless and important as either of the former.The story of this movie is as follows: Martians invade earth because their own planet is dying, landing in California first. Initial attempts to peacefully communicate with the aliens fail and warfare begins, with the U.S. military confidently opening fire, but it soon becomes clear that we are vastly outmatched by the literally indestructible Martian war machines. Scientist Clayton Forrester and his companion Sylvia, whom he met at the first alien landing site, encounter danger from the invaders and fellow humans alike as the world falls apart, but the attack abruptly ends when the Martians die of Earthly diseases to which they have no immunity.The story is only vaguely similar to the one from the book, but the details are unimportant because the themes of the powerful being weakened and human reaction to danger are intact, and that's what really matters. The acting is good, particularly Gene Barry as Forrester. The music is excellent and chilling, as are the incredible (for 1953) special effects. The image of the Martian war machines advancing slowly but steadily, gliding through the air while making discomforting, unearthly sounds is unforgettable and very frightening compared to other, tamer films from this time period.There are some heavy Christian tones, especially near the end, but nothing too offensive. I myself am an atheistic agnostic (one who does not follow or believe in any particular deity, but does not actively declare that such a deity certainly doesn't exist) I found nothing intrusive or rude about the religious connotations because they are handled in a respectful manner.All in all, this is the quintessential alien invasion movie, tying together all of these well-crafted aspects into a single cohesive and highly enjoyable experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Produced by George Pal, the doyen of science fiction cinema, this is an updating of H.G. Wells' classic novel of an invasion of Earth from Mars ( he was not the first to do this. Orson Welles' infamous 1939 radio adaptation proved so convincing that panic swept America ). It was a favourite of mine as a youngster, and in those pre-home video days I made sure I was in front of a television set each and every time it came on.The opening sequence ( narrated by Sir Cedric Hardwicke ) informs the audience that Mars has become uninhabitable, hence the beings who live there must search for a new home. Of all the planets in the Solar System, Earth is the only one compatible. Rather than asking us if they can come and live here, they decide to take the planet for themselves. When the first of their ships lands in a small American town, the locals are fascinated. Until it opens - and a thing resembling the head of a cobra emerges, spitting death rays.More and more cylinders land, more Martian machines emerge, annihilating all in their path. Despite the military's best efforts, the invaders are unstoppable. Earth looks doomed. Not even the atomic bomb can save us.The main character is Dr.Clayton Forrester ( Gene Barry ) who struggles to survive the onslaught while simultaneously trying to find a solution. He teams up with Sylvia Van Buren ( Ann Robinson - no, not the 'Weakest Link' lady! ), daughter of a clergyman who got incinerated by a Martian whilst reading aloud from the Bible ( his death scene was enough to turn me into a lifelong atheist ).The special effects were excellent for their day, and still hold up now ( despite the occasionally visible wires on the Martian war machines ). Wells' walking automatons have been replaced by sleek, manta-ray-like craft, and that ghastly rattling sound they make will not swiftly be forgotten. As 'Forrester', Gene Barry is wooden, but no more so than Tom Cruise in the Spielberg remake. Ann Robinson, no great thespian either, throws herself into the thing with commendable verve.So, as an adaptation of the Wells novel, this leaves much to be desired, but if what you're after is a thumping good '50's sci-fi flick, this cuts the mustard.Director Byron Haskin later worked on the classic sci-fi show 'The Outer Limits'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After all these years....still perfect.!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently purchased the "Special Edition" DVD of the original "War of the Worlds" and with the remixed surround soundtrack and crystal clear picture it is STILL one of, if not THE best sci-fi martian invasion movie ever made. Having mentioned the crystal clear picture, unfortunately you can see the strings extending from those elegantly sinister war machines(nothing even compares to those perfectly designed machines today), but even with that minor flaw (the strings), it is still a wonder to watch. Those classic sound effects used by the war machines blows you away in the surround sound mode (and still get used to this day occasionally in other movies). I also loved it due to the fact that the martians were intended to be the star of the movie, not the actors. I did see the Tom Cruise version of this and to me it just cant come close to the original. Technically yes, the visual effects are far superior, but still too much other drama taking away from the actual story of an invasion. And one must give the makers of the original Kudos for the effects they achieved in the original...all done WITHOUT a computer and earned an Oscar for it and rightfully so. It will always be a 10 to me. Plus on the "Special Edition" is a documentary of the making of, an H.G. Wells documentary, and the original trailer plus other features. A MUST have for any lover of sci-fi and especially of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"What IS that gizmo?" Residents of a rustic town near Los Angeles have their square dance interrupted after a meteor lands in their backyard and produces aliens from Mars. H.G. Wells' story, originally (and infamously) turned into a radio show which caused widespread panic in the U.S. upon its airing, gets the sleek, handsome George Pal treatment, with exciting action and frantic human drama filmed in eye-popping color. The Martians, freezing on their planet and looking for a warmer climate, have no pity for us Earthlings, and the initial violence is cruel and unsettling. For about three-quarters of the first hour, this science-fiction package provides gripping entertainment (with folksy characters and even some joshing humor)--but once the country goes to war, we lose much of that early spirit. The hardware is beautifully designed and displayed (courtesy of the large special effects team, who won an Oscar), and the pungent commentary on the human race turning animalistic in the face of destruction is still extremely relevant. But I missed the close-knit intimacy of the first act, which leaks away too soon to make room for more wide-scale concerns. Remade in 2005. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

Yet there are some things that this has that the book doesn't have, and some flaws. This took place in America instead of England, and the ships flew instead of moving like in the book, and the description of the aliens in this one doesn't look like the one described in the book.

		<fullReview>I was 6 when I saw War of the Worlds, my first color sci-fi film, "live" in a theater. (We did not have TV then!). I've seen all the other classics like "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", "Day the Earth Stood Still", "Them", "The Thing", etc. before and after WOTW, all good films but War of The Worlds was in a class all by itself. I know, the Brits lampoon the film all the time because it's not set in England/London, and not in the proper time period. I didn't know why it was updated and set in LA but..as a 6 year old I could have cared less...the movie was magical, frightening and memorable.Over the years I've read the book and and seen dozens of films within this genre. Yes, FX are far better now but 50 years ago this film set the standard. I hope the rumored remake in 2004 can be as memorable. Gene Barry and Ann Robinson did a great job. (If they're up to it, it would be neat for them to have cameos) Has anyone compared the farmhouse scene to the similar scene in "Close Encounters". Both deliver the goods...they scare the heck out of you. The sound effects were so outstanding the producers of the new film should consider using them again! All true WOTW fans know that the sounds of the "cobra" and the weapons fire are sounds you never forget..like the antenna sounds of "Them".Try to look past the re-locating and re-dating, kick back and enjoy a film that was king for 20-30 years, not topped until "2001", "Star Wars", "Close Encounters" and "Alien" came along.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>******Some Spoilers*******It's too easy to dismiss 50's sci-fi movies as being all the same hokum from the generation of gorp and tail-fin Fords; a screaming heroine, scientists save the world, the army and the church are good, evil aliens with lots of radiation, and we all fight for small town life-mom-and apple pie. War of the Worlds has all that in spades, but not only does it work, it's good. The f/x were landmark for the day, and are still watchable today, even if low-rent television has better. The battle scenes are actually pretty good, as is the dramatic tension. (The scene of the priest sacrificing himself to make contact is one of the notables, you know what's going to happen but it still hits you.) If you've never seen the movie it is a question how we'll get out of this one and defeat the Martians.The Martian attack craft are square in the fifties in style, but are some of the most memorable and recognizable sci-fi spacecraft. Modern sci-fi could take a lesson what with space ships that look like someone carved them out of a bar of soap. I've seen this movie several times since I was very young, and my feelings toward it has never changed, but by comparison its' surprising how different the modern world is. No current movie would make religion a theme in it, and the fifties was a time when we thought we had it together and believed in our values. By comparison today's movies are extremely cynical. Questioning values may be good, but with the nihilism and violence of today maybe it's better to still have *some* values. Social comparison aside, War of the Worlds is a true classic worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the first films I remember seeing as a child was War of the Worlds. I was probably only around 7 at the time, and the film was shown as one of a series of classic science-fiction films from the fifties and sixties. Even on a small black and white television set many of the images in the film burned themselves on my mind and and stayed with me throughout my childhood. Images such as the priest boldly walking towards the martian craft; the eerie pictures of empty streets in an evacuated Los Angeles; the panic of the people trying to escape ?and above all the frightening images of the alien craft rising slowly from the gully, pressing forth despite the massive fire-power directed at them. Their cold stateliness and absolute impregnability terrified me, but held great fascination, and I so easily managed to feel great empathy for all the human characters who were forced to evacuate the city, or face the consequences. I yearned for the film to be shown again, but it never was. However, a number of years later, when I was in my twenties, this was one of the first films I bought on video. Though excited at the prospect of seeing once again one of the most memorable movies of my childhood, I was also somewhat worried that the film could not live up my expectations and give me the same thrill when viewed with an adult sensibility. Happily my worries were unfounded, for I found myself being affected by the film in almost exactly the same way I had as a child. And having now seen War of the Worlds about a dozen times all in all it has lost none of its fascination. True a number of its flaws become quite apparent after so many viewings, and one does wish that some of the acting had a greater depth at times, but one cannot help being eternally intrigued by the predicaments facing the characters and their despair at their weakness in the face of such adversity. Above all there is a fascination for the effects which for the most part not only stand the test of time remarkably well (does it really deter anyone's enjoyment that a wire or two is visible occasionally?), but which unlike many films of today are there to serve the story, not the other way round. And yet the effects have so many grace notes that it would be wrong not to give them well deserved attention in a review such as this. Take for example the sound- effects of the martian craft as they patrol ?a disturbing, totally alien sound, with an eeriness that I believe is unmatched in film history. A lot of what frightened me as a child was the sound of this movie, which is also demonstrated by the remarkably forceful sound of the 'blasts' of the martian weapons. These sounds are 100% destructive, and matched perfectly with the streams or rays of the optical shots, which have themselves a disturbing strength.Despite what a number of people have said about the model work I think it is remarkable, and in most cases extremely convincing.(possible spoiler ahead:) There is just one shot towards the end of the movie, where a martian craft crashes into a building, which is not up to the standard of the rest of the film, but otherwise I always find myself totally convinced ?and if there are wires, I mostly don't see them because the film's atmosphere and narrative convince me not to!Another thing worth mentioning is the lighting. I find this extremely effective in the colouring of certain areas of the screen, which in the case of the martian nest are truly alien. The somewhat misty brightness of the green/turquoise associated with the martian's is contrasted nicely with the warmer, often earthy colours of the scenes involving humans. A lot of the film takes place at night, yet there is always colour even in the darkness. The photography of George Barnes certainly contributes to the fascination the film holds.In other words this is a movie that continues to intrigue, and deserves multiple viewing. If seen at home I recommend turning out the lights and watching it in the dark!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A war indeed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They weren't kidding around with its title! There really is a big war going on in this movie and it perhaps is the only movie of its sort and time period that actually does feel and look like a big budget production.But that really isn't the only thing that makes this movie unique really. One thing that obviously comes to your attention is the fact that this is a color production. Not only only unique for its time but also really for its genre. And I must say it also adds a lot to this movie, especially during all of the battle sequences, in which the aliens attack, with all of their bright lasers.But yes, there is way more that makes this movie unique in its sort. Normally these type of movies, made during the '50's, could more or less also been seen as (deliberatly or not) cold war propaganda productions, in which the Americans showed off their muscle power and always prevailed thanks to their superior military powers. In this movie that really isn't the case. As a matter of fact; the military doesn't stand a change at all in this movie, against the superior and more advanced Martians. It more is a movie of science versus the aliens, instead of the American army versus the aliens.So that also makes this a movie that quite often puts its emphasis on its science, rather than its fiction. It makes this also a movie with some more depth and heart to it, which all adds to the fact that this movie works out as quite original within its genre and also remains such a perfectly watchable one now days. It doesn't feel half as outdated as some of its fellow genre films, from the '50's.But don't worry. This movie isn't all talking about science, it also is one with plenty of action in it. I love it how the aliens are basically acting like normally the American military does in these type of movies; shoot first, ask questions later. Really, these guys (or gals) have no intention what so ever to become friendly with us. There are here for one reason and one reason only; to launch a war against humanity. It never becomes clear why or what they want from us but I actually quite like it that they didn't come up with an explanation for any of it. We don't every fully get to see the aliens themselves. It actually makes the aliens and their machines more menacing, also since you known that they can't be stopped and they also won't stop for anything, until every city is destroyed and every human lies death. Not just in the U.S. of A but all over the world, hence the title "The War of the Worlds".Also all of the special effects are all quite impressive, especially when you take into consideration that this is an 1953 movie. It's basically a great mixture or convincing practical effects and later added special effects. It also all adds to the mayhem of the war that is going on in this movie.The acting was also surprising good. Normally these type of movies really don't pay much attention to its acting and actors but Byron Haskin works different as a director luckily. Perhaps it's all due to the fact that Byron Haskin in fact had never directed a science-fiction movie before and had worked on mostly westerns and dramas previously, which normally required more acting in them.It still remains a great and impressive movie to watch!8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"If they start anything we can blast them right off the Earth." One of the best alien invasion pics you will ever see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The War of the Worlds begins with a black &amp; white prologue which talks about the first &amp; second world wars &amp; that every nation on Earth must now combine to fight the war of the worlds! The narration credited to Vittorio Cramer continues as the viewer is informed that the Martian race is looking to relocate &amp; the only suitable planet is Earth, the others are either too cold, too hot or are in a constant state of day or night. Earth appears perfect to the Martians who don't like to share... Somewhere in California just outside of Los Angeles what appears to be a meteorite falls from the sky &amp; crash lands on Earth. While on a fishing trip top scientist Dr. Clayton Forrester (Gene Barry) is asked to investigate but tells a local bird named Sylvia Van Buren (Ann Robinson, no not that one) that the meteorite is too hot to go near at the moment &amp; invites himself to a square dance party with her that very night. Three men, Wash Perry (William Phipps as Bill Phipps), Salvatore (Jack Kruschen) &amp; some other guy whose name I don't remember or more likely never mentioned, are left behind to guard the meteorite &amp; soon notice a round hatch unscrewing itself from which a antenna thing pops out &amp; incinerates them. Reports of similar meteorites landing all over Earth flood in as the military are called, Colonel Ralph Heffner (Vernon Rich) &amp; General Mann (Les Tremayne) liaise with Dr. Forrester about any potential alien threat &amp; let Miss Van Buren make tea &amp; cakes for the soldiers just like a 1950's woman should... Soon enough the Martians decide to launch their attack &amp; nothing the army has seems able to even dent their flying machines, not even an atom bomb. Scientists quickly predict that unless a way of stopping the Martian attack is found they will have taken over the entire Earth in just six days times...Directed by Byron Haskin The War of the Worlds is surely the Grandfather of all alien invasion films. The script by Barre Lyndon based on the H.G. Wells novel is quick to set things up with a lengthy narration that excludes the need for long scenes of exposition later on, a very good move. Before long Martian spaceships are destroying our planet with ruthless efficiency, unfortunately this point is where The War of the Worlds almost slows to an absolute halt as the script then concentrates on humanities (well a group of soldiers &amp; scientists) attempts to find a way of defeating the Martians. The Martians then make an appearance again ten or so minutes before the end which I personally think works terrifically well. There are a few expected 50's stereotypical characters here like Van Buren who is just there to scream &amp; provide the love interest although the blossoming relationship between Van Buren &amp; Forrester isn't as in your face as it could have been &amp; doesn't dominate. The sequence inside the farmhouse when we actually see a Martain for the first &amp; only time is quite creepy &amp; effective. The Martian itself is seen briefly &amp; looks OK but for the majority of The War of the Worlds the Martians themselves are not needed as their ships do all the damage. The ships have a certain elegance about them even if they look a little basic by todays standards, I could do without all the 70's cheap computer game like Space Invader sound effects though. The special effects are a million miles behind the likes of todays multi million Dollar CGI productions much like the Steven Spielberg War of the Worlds (2005) remake but they hold up reasonably well as long as you cut them some slack &amp; I've sat through a lot worse on much later &amp; much bigger budget productions. The acting is as wooden as most 50's Sci-Fi unfortunately but The War of the Worlds has a strong enough story &amp; provides enough entertainment to overlook this aspect. Cinematography is OK if a little bland &amp; as a whole Haskin doesn't seem like a particularly adventurous director with the whole production coming off as a little too by-the-numbers on occasion. Overall I liked The War of the Worlds a lot, it provides good clean fun entertainment throughout it's pacey 85 minutes running time. Definitely worth watching &amp; absolutely essential viewing for Sci-Fi fans but just don't expect state-of-the-art special effects or Oscar worthy acting...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Wait a minute! Asteroids don't unscrew!!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a few titles that I consider to be perfect science fiction titles, and I mean perfect in that they fit their content and their genre flawlessly. One of them is Star Wars, and another is The War of the Worlds. It's amazing to me that it took 50 years for someone to try to remake this classic, especially since remakes have become the cool thing to do over the last decade or so. This science fiction classic is one of the biggest landmarks of the genre, from director George Pal, who we also have to thank for the 1960 version of The Time Machine and who was probably the most famous name in science fiction in the 1950s.What I especially respected about the movie was the staying power that it retained by realizing the limitations of its special effects. For much of the first half of the movie, the crash landed space ship is nothing but a crisped asteroid and then a green glow behind the hills while locals and the national guard arrive to investigate. The film easily creates a level of tension and fear that had probably not been seen since Orson Welles did his radio adaptation of the story 15 yeas earlier, causing panic because it was done as a news broadcast and people thought that aliens had really invaded. I wish I had been there for that.In contrast to the benevolent, even good looking alien that invaded in The Day the Earth Stood Still, which was released a couple of years before this movie, the Martians in this movie are not interested in forcing the earthlings to help themselves, to join us and live in peace or pursue their present course and face obliteration. The three men that approach the craft peacefully and waving white flags are vaporized, turned into piles of ash where they stood. The military respond by firing upon the crafts with everything that they have (including the atomic bomb, which attracted hordes of curious onlookers who wanted to see the blast and probably walked away from it glowing with their hair falling out in clumps), but to no avail.The three alien spacecraft flying slowly and destroying everything in their path is pretty impressive despite the primitive special effects. I love the design of the ships themselves, very simple but very sleek and threatening and cycloptic, with stolid and constant movement. The effect on 1950s audiences must have been quite a sight to see, especially in the brief glimpses that we get of the Martians themselves, which is mostly just the arm at the end of the film.I read a review of the movie that made a very good point that the religious context of the final line in Wells' novel (that the Martians were "defeated by the smallest thing in God's creation") was taken entirely out of context, imposing massive religious meaning onto the material when there was never meant to be any there in the first place (Wells, an atheist, meant it ironically, not religiously). Ann Robinson says in the film that she always knew that if she hid in a church her true love would find her there, then sure enough it happened, then the alien ship crash lands in front of a church while the people surround it singing hymns thanking the heavens for their salvation.None of this really bothered me about the movie itself, although the perpendicular departure not only from the source material but from the author himself is a bit unsettling. What I had more of a problem with was the way the bacteria bringing down the ships was structured. They are going and going and going full speed, flying and shooting lasers at the people until all hope in their survival has been lost, and then just like that they start dropping out of the sky like flies. True, bacteria killed them in the novel, but I haven't read the novel and I like to think that it wasn't quite as abrupt and convenient there.Nevertheless, this remains a true science fiction classic that should not be missed, and I have great faith that the upcoming Spielberg remake will do justice both to H.G. Wells and to this film. Excellent show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as it gets.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Landmark science fiction film, extremely well directed and produced, benefits from an obviously respectable budget. It's intense, it's frightening, and it's action-packed, with characters whom we may not get to know that well, but are still inherently likable. Looking at "The War of the Worlds" now, it's clear that many alien invasion stories owe a big debt to this smashing H.G. Wells adaptation.The action is reset in (then) present day California, where intelligent Martian monsters land their enormous, strikingly designed vehicles. Human witnesses hope for the best, preparing to welcome the alien visitors with open arms, only to be met with utter hostility. The Martians open fire on the hapless humans, decimating city after city and claiming victim after victim. At the centre of the story is a heroic scientist, Dr. Clayton Forrester (Gene Barry), who makes a connection with the lovely young Sylvia Van Buren (Ann Robinson).The cast is completely stacked with character actor talent: Les Tremayne (as the stoic Major General Mann), Robert Cornthwaite, Sandro Giglio, Lewis Martin, Paul Frees, William Phipps, Henry Brandon, Jack Kruschen, Edgar Barrier, Paul Birch, Alvy Moore, Walter Sande, etc. (Pay close attention and you'll spot Carolyn Jones at a party.) Barry and Robinson are winning in the lead roles, and one does root for them to survive the situation.Produced by George Pal and directed by Byron Haskin, this remarkable film has some very memorable visuals, especially the swan like destroyer spaceships, the creepy monsters themselves (although we only ever get a good look at one of them), and their "telescopes". The multi-coloured triple eyes are pretty neat. The scenes of destruction are so chaotic that they completely involve you in the action.Some viewers may feel that the ultimate resolution is on the anticlimactic side, but others may appreciate the fact that Earths' salvation does not come in the form of any conventional weapon.Filmed again for theatres no less than THREE times in 2005, and also followed by a TV series (1988-1990).10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Martians have used up the resources of their planet and they're looking for other planets. A suspected meteor lands outside the Californian town of Linda Rosa. People have gathered to put out the fire and then to enjoy the sight. Noted atomic scientist Dr. Clayton Forrester who is fishing nearby comes to take a look. Sylvia van Buren teaches library science at USC. They decide to go back to town and wait for the meteor to cool down. The Martians war machine activates and starts its killing spree. Other landings occur around the world.It is an iconic sci-fi and a marvel of its era. It is still a compelling narrative today. The special effects are fun. The miniatures are terrific. The design of the aliens are timeless. What is even better is the sound design. The alien sounds and the weapons fire are truly memorable. There is a lot of stock footage used. The wires are very much visible. Nevertheless this is not some cheap B-movie. They use some real action effects and stunts. They have lots of extras and the two leads are acceptable as actors. The battle in L.A. is no small matter. The prevalence of the religious tone is something different from the material and more fitting for the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Science Fiction, Better than Any Subsequent Version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The War of the Worlds, while not a perfect adaption of the H. G. Wells novel, is arguably the best adaption of Wells ever put on screen, with the only real competitor being Island of Lost Souls. As a child, I was a huge fan of Wells's novels, with War of the Worlds being my favorite of all. This film more than met my expectations as a child and still holds up as an adult.The film benefits from Academy Award winning effects that hold up well even today. Yes, you can see the occasional wire, as was par for the course at the time, but the practical effects are still superb. More importantly, they have a sense of weight that no CGI-effect can match. In the close up shots of the Martian fighting machines, you can tell that a real object is being filmed. Gene Barry and Ann Robinson are obviously running around on an actual set, rather than in front of a green screen.The film also maintains a good level of tension, having a surprisingly dark atmosphere for a fifties science fiction movie. The Martians' advance seems genuinely unstoppable, backed by Sir Cedric Hardwicke's ominous narration. The flashes to battles outside of the United States give the sense of a true war of the worlds, a sense lacking from Spielberg's remake.There are a few weak points. The Cold War allegory is made a little too obvious at points, and the religious theme gets a little over the top at times, particularly given the cynical depiction of Christianity in the novel. (Was I the only one who noticed that Barry only finds Robinson after he gets to an obviously mainline Protestant church?) Nevertheless, the 1953 War still ranks as the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With the Man Who Wrote Orson Welles' Radio Broadcast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Whenever I watch the 1953 film version of H.G. Wells' "War of the Worlds" _ and I watch it ever time I can _ I am reminded of its Rosetta Stone, as it were: Orson Welles' infamous Halloween Eve 1938 broadcast that panicked America. The film captures the furious pace and nightmarish fears that both Welles and George Pal understood so well. It was that rare transferral of the imagined to the Technicolor reality. To that end, I find it amusing to recall how Welles' original script, produced by his Mercury theatre on the Air, came about. Th following is a piece I wrote about that deceptively simple occurrence. I hope you enjoy it _ and that it enhances your viewing pleasure the next time you watch the movie./Gj)WITH WRITER HOWARD KOCH His 'War of the Worlds' Radio Script Panicked America On Oct. 30, 1938, Orson Welles' Mercury Theatre on the Air broadcast an adaptation of H.G. Wells' "War of the Worlds" -- that presentation has gone down as the most famous (or infamous) radio program of all time. Of the six million who listened, 1.2 million thought they were really listening to news reports of aliens landing in an attempt to take over humankind. Word spread fast, and that night became known as "the night that panicked America." Howard Koch -- who wrote the script for that show in only six days -- told me in an interview a half- century later that he had been blissfully ignorant of what was happening. He had gone home to listen to the broadcast, and fallen asleep. He slumbered on even as co-producer John Houseman tried to call him to ask that he preserve his copy of the script because the police had seized all the others. The next morning, an unaware Koch awoke, wondering what to do on his day off. "I lived on (New York's) 72nd Street, west side, and I was walking down the street to get a haircut. As I went along I heard people talking about 'invasion' and 'war,' and I thought Hitler had made a move. I rushed into the barbershop and said to the barber, 'Are we at war or something?' He laughed and held up the newspaper headline: 'Martian Invasion Panics Nation.' I can tell you it was a strange moment in my life. To tell you the truth, I didn't know how to feel.'" Asked if he thought it could happen again, he replied: "Absolutely." In 1944, the same script was broadcast in Chile with the same results there. The same after a 1949 broadcast in Ecuador. And back here in America in 1983 and 1984 during the broadcast AND rerun of a similar TV show called "Special Bulletin," about terrorists exploding an A-bomb in South Carolina, people nationwide called stations to ask: "Is it really happening?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This World and the Next</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first cinema adaptation of H. G. Wells' classic novel, although it had famously been adapted for radio by Orson Welles. The producer George Pál was known for his science fiction films, and later produced and directed a version of Wells' "The Time Machine". "The War of the Worlds" was directed by Byron Haskin, a frequent collaborator with Pál. As Orson Welles had done in 1938, and as Stephen Spielberg was to do when he filmed a version of the story in 2005, Pál and Haskin moved the setting from the South-East England of the 1890s to contemporary America, in this case southern California. In each case I think this was the right decision. Science fiction is a genre which concerns itself with what might happen in the present or in the future, not with what might have happened in the past. A modern film which showed Martians attacking Victorian London would be an odd mixture of sci-fi and alternative history (a literary genre which rarely transfers well to the cinema) and would probably look very quaint. The film follows the basic outlines of Wells' story. The Martians, whose home planet is a cold, barren world, cast envious eyes on the warmer, more fertile Earth. In the opening voice-over we learn that they have considered, but rejected, several other planets in the Solar System; the one that is not mentioned as a possible alternative home is Venus, probably because in the 1950s this planet was (wrongly) regarded by scientists as being suitable for life. They land on Earth in overwhelming force and begin attacking the planet's inhabitants with their advanced weaponry. Human weapons, including the atomic bomb, prove useless against the Martian war machines, and it seems that it will be only a matter of days before the world is overrun. Besides altering the date and location, the film also changes some of the emphases of Wells' novel. It omits (probably wisely) Wells' observations on imperialism, civilisation and the class system and has a more pronounced religious emphasis. The final scene in the church, where the survivors pray for deliverance, has no equivalent in the book, although even Wells, by no means a religious man, attributed to the workings of divine wisdom the microbes which prove to be the invaders' downfall. It is perhaps significant that the last words were hear are those of Martin Luther's hymn:-"And free us from all ills, In this world and the next". This film is sometimes quoted as one of the great science fiction films of the fifties, although, given that the genre had a deservedly bad reputation during the period due to the efforts of inept directors like Ed Wood, that might not be considered very high praise. It is, however, considerably better than most fifties sci-fi, and, indeed, I would rank it higher than Spielberg's version. It won an Oscar for its special effects, which are very impressive by the standards of the period, especially the depiction of the Martian attack on Los Angeles. One thing that the effects department could not get right were the tripods, the Martian vehicles described by Wells, with the result that the invaders go into battle in sleek hovercraft-type craft shaped like a flying-wing aircraft. (A human flying-wing is shown delivering the atomic bomb). One thing that is rather perfunctory is the characterisation. The two main characters are Dr. Clayton Forrester, a famous scientist, and his love-interest Sylvia van Buren, but neither is particularly well developed. There are no major stars in the film; Clayton and Sylvia are played by Gene Barry and Ann Robinson, neither of whom had anything like the high profile that Tom Cruise, who plays the leading role in the 2005 movie, enjoys today.There is, however, a reason for this. There is something of a modern convention that disaster films should follow a two-part structure, the first part introducing us to a select group of characters with whom we can identify and the second dealing with the disaster itself. This structure works well enough when we are following the attempts of the select group to escape from, say, a sinking ship or burning building, but it seems inadequate when the film concerns the future of the entire planet. In his version, however, Spielberg follows this convention too closely, as does M. Night Shyamalan in "Signs", another recent alien-invasion film, with the result that the audience end up asking themselves "can Tom Cruise survive?" or "can Mel Gibson survive?", when they should be asking themselves "can the human race survive?" Pál and Haskin avoid this trap; indeed, by 1953 this convention had probably not yet evolved. They were not trying to make a character-driven film concentrating on a few individuals, but a film about a threat to the entire world. Unlike Spielberg and Shyamalan, whose films are both very America-centric, they show us what is happening in other parts of the world and the efforts of world governments to co-ordinate their efforts. As a result this is one alien-invasion film that actually manages to convince us something immense is at stake. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to California</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Byron Haskin's 1953 "War of the Worlds" is one of the classic films in the science fiction genre. The movie opens with the narrator, Cedric Hardwicke, describing the plight of the Martians as they search for a new planet to colonize to save their race. Earth is selected and soon after a meteor crashes into the hills outside of Linda Rosa, a small town in southern California. This is the initial scout ship and pilot for the rest of the Martian fleet, which quickly develops into a worldwide invasion. Dr. Clayton Forrester (Gene Barry), aided by Sylvia Van Buren (Ann Robinson), urgently work to find a way to defeat the invaders as the armies of the countries across the globe fall to the technologically superior Martian's war machines.In "War of the Worlds", director Byron Haskin gives a heavy nod to family and religion. Sylvia is from a large family, while Clayton only has his surrogate family of professors from Pacific Tech, yet yearns for more. Her favorite relative is her uncle Pastor Dr. Matthew Collins (Lewis Martin) who found Sylvia in a church when she ran away from home. Church settings play significantly in various scenes throughout the movie. The aspects of humanity and religion are addressed in multiple scenes as well. First when Pastor Collins approaches a Martian craft, up to the ending when man seemingly cannot defeat his adversary. One has to question how H. G. Wells, a known atheist, would have reconciled the heavy influence of religion in the movie.The movie's use of drama, suspense, and special effects bring the viewer into the horror of the invasion. One of the films more suspenseful scenes is when the three na?ve deputies guarding the meteor realize that it is not what it seems. After deciding the meteor is from Mars, they approach it and attempt to contact the visitors by waving a cotton sack as a white flag and say 'Welcome to California.' The Martians want nothing of peace and summarily vaporize the men. Another excellent dramatic scene is when Clayton and Sylvia are attempting to flee the destroyed farmhouse and they have a visitor. Through the use of special effects, which were state of the art for its time, the viewer comes to realize the awesome, unstoppable power of the Martian war machine.</fullReview>

Based on HG Wells story, this is, in my opinion, THE classic alien invasion movie and story, and one of my favorite science fiction movies of all time. The alien invaders are graceful, beautiful and deadly. There is a consistent sense of suspense and dread which pervades the whole film and is one of the effective parts of it.I like the pacing with a reasonable amount of action, both on a grand and a little scale, and I like the characters and the vision of humanity that is portrayed.

		<fullReview>War of the Worlds - Winner of Oscar for Visual Effects After being sorely disappointed with Spielberg's shoddy adaptation of HG wells novel, I decided to take a step back 50 cinematic years to Byron Haskin's frivolously intense mini sci-fi masterpiece. The story slightly differs from Spielberg's version and I assume that this version is more faithful to the novel. The story is basically, martians begin to fall from space in the form of meteors in the hope of taking over earth as a new home. The chilling opening of narration is quite dehumanising, giving that we can be so insignificant and powerless to other forces in this huge universe.But anyway, these martians in their flying machines slowly begin to land all over the world killing everything in sight. These inpenetrable forces even survive a nuclear bomb. The human race has no hope and it seems as if the end is near.To add to this frightening storyline, the visual effects are simply breathtaking, taking into account that it was made in 1953. Furthermore, the sound effects of the film seem clichéd at this day of age but this was made in 1953! so it can easily be looked over.This film is a sci-fi classic and whether it can challenge such sci-fi greats as star wars or bladerunner is for you to decide. In my opinion, no simply because the length was disheartening. But nonetheless, the film deserves a place in my top 20 sci-fi films of all time and it should to everyone.War of the Worlds - A sci-fi Classic 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely one Sci-Fi Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The War of the Worlds (1953, Dir. Bryon Haskins) It's the 20th Century and to the unsuspecting human population, Martians from another planet are appearing on Earth with destruction on their mind. Whilst everyone panics, Dr. Clayton Forrester (Barry) and Sylvia Van Buren (Robinson) join together in hiding out away from all the mayhem.The original War of the Worlds is one of those sci-fi classics which will struggle to gain young fans today. The story might be as simple as an alien attack could be, with a couple just hiding away from the danger, and the characters are well built. But there are some moments which are simple but are laughable. Who would be able to cook food and calmly eat it, whilst the planet is falling apart around you? Compared to today's standards, the visual effects are not impressive either but this would be expected. You would just have to put yourself in a state of mind where you can easily see past the wire holding the alien ships up. It is a wonderful example of a classic science fiction film, but would have a hard job of attracting new fans who are casual viewers."The Martians had calculated their descent with amazing perfection and subtlety. As more of their cylinders came from the mysterious depths of space, their war machines, awesome in their power and complexity, created a wave of fear throughout the world." ? Commentary (Cedric Hardwicke)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating and Riveting! One of the Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great film, one to watch on a Friday night. Gene Barry is cool and calculating as a scientist on the brink of discovery. The Martians are well portrayed and the girl in this film is quite entertaining. There is something magical about this film. It is a true and faithful rendition of the H. G. Wells' story. Though it is fantastic it works. There is a Christian flavour to the movie with Sir Cedric Hardwicke doing the narration. Also, the times are admirably reflected in this film. The square dance adds a quaintness to the movie, and the isolation of the city, the panic of the evacuation, the Martians themselves, their weapons of mass destruction, their seeming invulnerability, the sound effects, the ineffectiveness of the military (which is reminiscent of a Godzilla movie), are all superbly portrayed. I believe this movie won a Special Effects Academy Award.A great science fiction film faithfully depicted. Get it to own!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best in early Sci-Fi.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adapted from the novel by H.G.Wells, The War of the Worlds is, in my opinion, one of the very best Sci-Fi's of the 1950's; and one of my "Top 10 Sci-Fi's" of all time. The War of the Worlds was one of the first movies that actually gave me the creeps the first time I watched it.From the excellent special effects to the eerily futuristic-looking spaceships (which many refer to as Swan-like), this "Doomsday" film isn't the result of a wayward planet or asteroid, but from intelligent beings from another planet. They are not here on a mission of peace or goodwill, their mission is even simpler than that: Total annihilation of the human race and the conquest of the planet earth.Not only does The War of the Worlds treat us to great acting and a screenplay that is superb, but in one particular scene when one of the aliens sneaks up behind our heroine and touches her shoulder...well...THAT has got to be one of the scariest moments in film! It also produced what I think is one of the greatest screams ever caught on film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old school alien movie of it's time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based off of the thrilling and memorable novel by H.G. Wells. War of the Worlds begins with a narration on the planets of the solar system and a brief notice of Mars planning to make an invasion on earth. Then a comet crashed landed in a open field. It appeared to be an ordinary comet from the reaches of space, but a scientist named Dr. Forrester examined it and discovered with his radiation meter that the comet has some cosmic activity going on inside it. And because of that the area had to be blocked off and watched over.One night however, the comet begins to show a sign of activity. As a large scope came out of the rock. And then a floating alien machine has became present and begins to vaporize everything that moves. The army tries all it can to destroy the martian made machine, but the earth's use of weapons are no match for it what so ever. It continuously creates mass destruction on humanity. This is more than a war, but more of an extermination on the human race.Dr. Forrester who was both shocked and fascinated by the martian's technology, has to survive the invasion. The question is does Man kind have the chance to survive? And what can defeat the Martians? Despite it being over 53 years old, it's been a classic for all these years. And has given inspiration to many Sci-Fi creators alike. The special effects are "old", but the movie did gave me goosebumps when I first saw it in my Freshman class.I think any Sci-Fi fan alike will consider "War of the Worlds" a worthy gem of cinema history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it in HD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This classic has been showing recently on Monster HD on Dish Network. It truly is as close to the big screen as it can be without leaving your living room. I am not old enough to have seen it in original release but am old enough to have seen it at least 10 times on regular TV. In HD it is an entirely new experience. As for the comments faulting it for not resembling the book (mostly from Wells' fans in Great Britain) I say so what? What is with this constant assumption that a movie and a book with the same title must match each other to the last detail? Why can't they be different and both still be classic? This is a fine sci-fi movie in so many ways considering its 1953 release. Watch it knowing it resembles the book very little and you'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing film for its day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read the book and of the three films that I've seen that have been adapted from the book, this one is still the best. This movie doesn't have quite the glitzy special effects that were used in the recent Spielberg version, but the effects are numerous (and exceptional for their day). The movie was produced in 1953 &amp; the effects, which won an academy award, stand up even today. I found them clever and (mostly) quite believable. The movie maintains a fast pace with plenty of action and some very tense moments midway through that will leave you feeling pretty creepy if you watch it alone in the dark.Not only are the "Martians" really bad, we also see how our society begins to break down as the combined military might of the world seems unable to stop the alien onslaught. Through it all, a dedicated group of scientists continue to work on ways to defeat the aliens even as the world is dying around them. Although their efforts are no match for the alien invaders, the aliens have also made a serious miscalculation and upon that little mistake hangs the fate of all mankind. You won't know who is going to win until the last five minutes of the movie. The "surprise" ending of the story is true to Wells' book, written over 100 years ago. I prefer this particular version of the story because it maintains a level of tension and a good pace without subjecting us to the gore and violence that pervade modern films. Even without the gore, this film is probably too intense for young children. For a combination of a strong story combined with good effects, this movie is a winner that your whole family can watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true Sci-Fi classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a few classic films from the Sci-Fi genre of the 1950s. This is one of them. "War of the Worlds" is stunning. The film is in color, which is typical from a George Pal film but rare when it was made. The special effects for their time are outstanding. They are the equivalent of George Lucas' in "Star Wars". Both films set the bar for future special effects in the movies. The acting is very well done,especially Gene Barry, Ann Robinson and Les Tremayne. It is non-stop action from the opening scene. The spaceships are really cool and I love when they attack with their lasers! Nothing can stop them.....or can they? I won't spoil the ending because you won't believe how they are defeated. This is a film that any fan of 1950s Sci-Fi movies has to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The War of the Worlds (1954 version) still holds up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another of those fantastic movies that you may stumble across on one of the classic film TV channels. Whenever I do, I know that I'm going to wind up foregoing several of the things that I wanted to finalize on that particular day because I won't be able to pull myself away from the Television. I find the film just as interesting and riveting now as I did when I first saw it more than 40 years ago. I'm not referring to the actors in this movie. They do a good job, but almost any capable actor could have done as well. This is a movie where the story and the special effects grab you, not the job being done by the actors. The story is probably more believable now than it was 50 years ago. Medical science and our knowledge of immunology was not nearly as advanced as it is now, and it's likely that many who saw the movie, didn't really understand why the aliens finally died. The film came along at a time when there was a great deal of interest in U.F.O.s, as they were first broadly reported upon in the late 1940s, only a few years before the movie was made. At the same time, the U.S. Airforce was still immersed in, Operation Bluebook, it's study of the U.F.O. phenomenon and Orson Wells had already scared the East Coast of the United States to death with his radio broadcast of The War of the Worlds on Hallowe'en night 1939. I suspect that many of those who first viewed the film were more interested in seeing a scary movie than a scientific study and I'm sure they weren't disappointed. Now, some 50 years later, I can look at the movie and see it as a film that was away ahead of it's time. H.G. Wells wrote the story on which the movie was based long before it was made into a film. He must have been a genius. His stories were almost prophetic relative to what you'd normally expect from a science fiction writer. His books introduced readers to space travel, undersea travel and time travel at a time when people were still reading by oil lamps and travelling by horse and carriage.Don't miss this one if you get a chance to see it on some obscure channel at 3 a.m.. It's well worth staying awake for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so it isn't exactly very faithful to the novel.Okay, so the acting is questionable, and the forced love story between the characters Sylvia and Dr. Forrester is not very believable.So what!I think that 'The War of the Worlds' deserves a lot of praise, for not only being the first film adaption of the novel after forty-five years since it was first published, but for its great special effects. Although in our stupid world in which the computer dominates the special effects you see on screen, people would label the visuals in this film 'unconvincing', you still have to appreciate this film, which was made in a world where computers couldn't do squat for the film-making industry.They were all done with miniatures, people!I don't care what anybody thinks, I still think this is slightly better than Steven Spielberg's remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What is that gizmo?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw the film again today after a long time, and was actually somewhat surprised to see it in color; my first viewing must have been eons ago during the black and white TV era. As such, I found the alien ships to respond well to the Technicolor palate of 1953, as well as the destruction they caused in a spray of primary colors. Quite well done for the technology of the time.I get a kick out of the reviewers who waylay the film for not sticking closer to the original H.G. Wells vision, as if they would have actually preferred to see the aliens battled with field artillery and cannon balls. The same goes for those who belittle the 2005 remake for not remaining truer to the Gene Barry version. Here's a clue to help one understand - it's entertainment.The twist in the film of course is that this time out, we humans aren't the bad guys. The Martian invaders are hell bent for leather to conquer Earth and reinvigorate their dying civilization, and they ain't sharing. It really makes for some horrific destruction, starting with those three white flag wielding peacemakers reduced to ashes. Compare the symbolism here to that of "The Day The Earth Stood Still", where the alien rays made Earth weapons simply disappear. This is a film that works the psyche into a frenzy, as successive levels of power up to and including the atomic bomb have absolutely no effect on the Martians' progress. It couldn't be any plainer - there's no hope for mankind.As grim as it all sounds, there are some lines that struck me as somewhat humorous, though I'm sure they weren't meant to be. The first was the "What is that gizmo?" line when the alien craft makes it's first appearance. The other nearly caused me to roar; it's when the crowds were getting ready to view the first A-Bomb blast like a sporting event. In the background, a voice announces - "Attention please, four minutes to bomb time"! Keep an eye on Dr. Forrester (Gene Barry) during the street panic scene in Los Angeles as he frantically inquires about the Pacific Tech trucks. His face is bleeding and bruised, but after running across some deserted streets, another closeup shows his face is clear. Later on, he's shown with bruises on his face, but no bleeding.OK, the film is dated, but it was made over fifty years ago. Watch almost ANY sci-fi film of the era, including many made into the 1960's, and there's virtually nothing that comes close in terms of special effects and effective story telling for the genre, and it works as a thriller as well. For that reason, it has it's special place in science fiction film history, even with the liberties taken on the original source material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original and the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is still a very good and very watchable film even now. All the Martian "sounds" are pretty much part of the mainstay of Science Fiction sound effects today.The 1st big mistake is the heat ray that the ship fires to kill the first 3 men when the "meteor" hatch unscrews. The EMP(electro magnetic pulse) that seems to stop watches. Back in 1953 most if not all watches would be clockwork, EMP would NOT effect clockwork).The film sets The Martians as totally different from humans, creating an "Us &amp; Them" situation mirroring the East Versus West fears of The Cold War in an already paranoid America telling it's people to beware of Reds Under The Bed.Of course the first response is to send in the military to try and suppress the Martians. Even though only 3 men and a plane and its crew have been destroyed, it is already clear that back then the concept of "acceptable losses" had not been formed.The reaction to "blast them right off the Earth", is a typical macho attitude of the time with America thinking there is nothing their military can't stop.The Priest who has the idea to try to communicate is acting as the voice of reason which is totally ignored of course. He is of course unaware that 3 men already tried this and died.For 1953 the special effects of the ships flying is still quite good and stands the test of time pretty well.The middle of the film is pretty dull, with the capture of the electronic eye and the Martian Blood. It seems to only be there to fill time until they decide to drop a nuclear weapon on the Martians.Again the Americans trying to show superior firepower, almost mirroring their actions in WWII.No-one ever bothers to find out why the Martians came, what they wanted. Those things seem to be unimportant to the people of Earth.It's funny that they think using a bomb will allow people to go back to their homes when they would be unable to returns for years after because of the radiation. The fact that so many people look at the blast (it would burn out their retina's) and that one of the scientists tries to ask about the result by radio (the blast would knock it out for miles around) are two more VERY big goofs.Also the evacuation of the cities is far too calm and orderly, there would be mass panic everywhere.At least the scenes of looting and manic chaos seem real. And another goof, the main scientist goes past lots of abandoned cars in the cities but he'd already been told anything on wheels was being hijacked.People turn to religion as they think it's the end of the world but the ships just start falling out of the sky as though it's divine intervention.In the end it's left to the scientists to try and find a way to stop the Martians which ends up being something so simple that kills them, the ordinary germs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This original screen adaptation of H.G. Wells' classic story of interplanetary war offers plenty of special effects, and floating spaceships of death. While dated by todays standards, the effects do not detract from this film, which offers a multitude of readings into the general mindset of America during the 1950s when paranoia and the possibility of nuclear annihilation by the reds was at its highest. Though the medium's technological limitations change certain aspects of the novel, the overall themes remain. An exploration of humanity's vulnerabilities and ultimate fears that is still applicable to our contemporary world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is great! Much better than any other WotW movies. However, compared to today's Special FX, they are horrid. The martians are totally fake, and their shadows seem to "slide" instead of walk. However, compared to other really old movies I've seen, the Special FX are pretty good. The heat-ray looks good, though.This movie is about a man named Dr. Forrester. He meets a young woman named Sylvia when a meteor crashes in southern California. The meteor is extremely hot, and few people dare go too close to it, fearing they will be burned. Three men are chosen to guard the meteor overnight.The men are ready to leave after no activity occurs from the meteor. However, one of the men proclaims "It's moving!" and the men start to watch the "meteor".A small hole unscrew on the fake meteor, and a long "eye" peeks out. The men decide to show these men from Mars that the humans are friendly. They approach the machine eye, waving a white flag. Soon, the the eye starts to glow furiously, makes noises, and shoots a huge ray at the men.The town's power goes out and three men go over to see the meteor. When there, their car and one of the men is burned by the ray.The military is called to destroy the menace. Three hovering machines float out of the meteor. The military men start to shoot at them with rockets, tanks, machine guns, and other pinnacle warfare of 1953. However, the martian machines are protected by some sort of shield. They start to attack the military men with their heat-rays, and a green ray. The green ray slowly burns the military people to nothing.The air-force is called to destroy the martian machines, but to no avail. Dr. Forrester and Sylvia hide in a farmhouse to get a bite to eat. When in there, a meteor crashes into the house, knocking out Forrester for hours. When he comes to, and small probe enters the house connected on a tube. The tube is connected to a martian machine outside. There are several of the machines of death.The probe goes away, but the two people are spotted by another one. Forrester chops of the "head" with an ax. The tube slowly retreats back to the ship.Sylvia screams when she views an E.T. like creature outside, and Forrester wishes he would have seen it. While Forrester tries to make an escape route without being seen by the martian machines, a shadow of a martian is seen moving toward the heroes. A long, slimy, clammy hand grabs Sylvia's shoulder. She is scared half to death, and slowly turns to see the martian. Forrester throws the ax into the martian's face, and it runs away. The two heroes escape with martian blood, the head of the probe (which is modeled after the martians' head), just as the farmhouse is burned by a heat-ray.The blood and probe are studied. An evacuation of the town is called when the martian machines start to move toward it. In the mayhem, Dr. Forrester loses his truck and science instruments. Also, Forrester and Sylvia are separated.The martian machines have entered the city now, and they burn any building they see. Dr. Forrester finds Sylvia in a church. The martian machines start to attack the church. Suddenly, they stop working a fall down. This has happened all over the world.The martians were killed by our own germs. The End.This movie is great! You can rent it for 3 bucks, but why not just save the trouble and buy the special edition DVD for 5 bucks? Note: A really funny error is visible whenever the martian machines are viewed: you can see the strings holding them up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this movie is very fake in today's standards, it is still a great classic alien-invasion movie. Based on H.G. Wells's bestselling novel, which I have also read and come to enjoy."The War of the Worlds" is perhaps, even today, one of the best science-fiction movies. Definitely one of the best from its time. It has great special effects and I believe it won the Academy Award for that achievement. True, you can see the strings holding up the flying machines, but you can see that in just about every old-time science-fiction horror film. But the visual and sound effects used for the machines and their heat rays were very well-made. Personally, I did feel that the aliens themselves were a little bit goofy-looking, but then again, back in 1953 they were probably scary.The only other thing that I noticed was that the dialogue in some scenes sounded really unusual or strange. But it didn't matter and still doesn't. "The War of the Worlds" is still one of the best science-fiction movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good 50's sci-fi flick that would inspire filmmakers to come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that got a lot of TV play back in the 60's. I haven't seen it in a while but I've seen this many times. Screenwriter and playwright Barré Lyndon who wrote screenplays for such films as The Greatest Show on Earth, the Lodger and The Night Has a Thousand Eyes adapted a good screen story from the classic H.G. Wells novel. Cecil B. DeMille was supposed to do this film back in the silent era of films but apparently the director of historical epics was not much of a futurist and never got around to making it but he was the executive producer here and got 50's sci-fi film czar George Pal to put the project together as the film's producer. Pal brings his special effects creative mind and team on board and veteran director Byron Haskin directs. Haskin was a veteran film director, special effects director and cinematographer with a career dating back to the 20's. This would be the first of three films he would direct for George Pal. George Barnes who was a veteran of films dating back to the silent era and a longtime photographer of DeMille films is this film's cinematographer. imaginative special effects for it's day. Excellent sound effects too. The combined effects appropriately give the viewer a creepy feeling. One of those inspiration films of films to come. A good 50's sci-fi flick but falls a little short of greatness. I would give it a 8.0 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Martians conquer humanity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best science fiction movies of the 20th Century. It isn't very scary today, since we just had a remake War of the Worlds and it was completely stunning, with perfect special effects and great acting. But this movie was the best of its time, and some of its special effects still look good today (not counting the painted backgrounds.) It starts with a chilling commentary by Cedric Hardwicke, who informs us about the Martians searching for a suitable planet, then cuts to a small, bright object streaking through the sky. Some of the dialogue could be improved ("Is that a fireball or somethin'?"; "Jeepers that's big!", etc.) but if you take some of it to be a joke, it's OK. The supposed meteorite, which is metal and shaped like a cylinder, lands in Pine Summit, and three men are told to keep watch to make sure it doesn't start any fires. The rest of the town goes off to a square dance, leaving the three men to freeze their asses off in the middle of the forest. The cylinder unscrews and a periscope-like machine emerges, shooting an orange beam at the men and disintegrating them and their cars. Back at the square dance, all lights, phones, and watches stop working. Clayton Forrester, a scientist, discovers that his watch has been magnetized, and the hands are pointing towards Pine Summit. They go to the impact site, and discover three burnt piles of ash sitting in the dirt in front of the gully. The Heat Ray rotates slowly from the inside of the cylinder, and Forrester realizes what has happened. The military is called in, and three fighting machines, enormous metal manta-rays equipped with Heat Rays and standing on tripod legs, step out of the cylinder. They sweep all of the soldiers and their weapons out of existence, and Forrester and Sylvia, a woman he meets, escape in a fighter airplane. They take shelter in a deserted farmhouse when another cylinder hits the house. It collapses around them, and they are trapped in a pile of rubble. An electronic eye on the end of a metal tentacle comes in and explores the room, and when it sees them, Forrester cuts the end off and it retreats. Finally, the Martians come in and we see them. They are brown and wrinkled, and are made up of an enormous head, two long arms ending in suction-cupped fingers, a tri-lensed eye, and six tentacles for legs. Forrester throws a board at it, and it screams and runs. Martian blood splashes on Sylvia's scarf, and they take it to a lab for testing. They discover that there are no diseases on Mars, and therefore no immune systems. This is important to the plot, but signifies nothing at the moment. The army drops an atomic bomb on the war machines, but the blast is deflected by invisible, umbrella-shaped electromagnetic force fields projected from the tripods' legs. Los Angeles is destroyed and Sylvia is separated from Forrester in the confusion. Clayton's van and equipment are destroyed by an angry mob, and he says that it was their last chance for survival, as he had blood samples in the van that showed how vulnerable the Martians were to terrestrial sickness. Forrester finds Sylvia in a church, where desperate people are praying to God for a miracle to save them as the Martians destroy the city. Finally, the noise outside ceases, and they go outside to see what is wrong. A Tripod has shut down and crashed into the church. The hatch on the bottom hisses open and a dead Martian falls out, slain by the common cold. Fade out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched it again for the first time in many years, and I am still impressed! This version (to me anyway) is far more believable than the 2005 edition. The manta saucers are beautiful, elegant, and frightening and made a huge impression on me the first time I saw them as a boy. It also set a standard for special effects that wasn't equaled until 2001 over 10 years later. With War of the Worlds and The Time Machine, George Pal secured an exalted place in science fiction cinema that even Spielberg would be hard pressed to equal. I'm not sure if anyone else has noticed, but some scenes on the recent DVD version are blurry. It almost appears that something went wrong during remastering to DVD. Also, the scenes of the mantas are so clear, the wires supporting them are plainly visible. Woodfan</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Fifties Adaptation Of H.G. Wells' Classic Alien Invaders Yarn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unusual meteor lands in rural California and a vacationing scientist, Dr Clayton Forrester, is called in to investigate. The meteor reveals itself to be a Martian spacecraft housing three triangular flying ships equipped with devastating weaponry. As more and more meteors land and the military are called in, it transpires there is a full-scale Martian invasion of Earth taking place. Can mankind survive and prevail against these aggressive and technologically superior foes ? One of many great American science-fiction classics of the fifties, this is a terrific adaptation of H.G. Wells' astounding adventure novel. Although it relocates the action from the south-east of England in 1898 to California in 1953, it captures perfectly the sense of complacency in the face of the extra-terrestrial threat and the subsequent anarchy and paranoia which are the main themes of the book. This is simply a fantastic story, and Haskin and producer George Pal bring it vividly to life as a tremendous technicolor spectacle with terrific sets, special effects and especially sound effects. The last reel, as Barry runs through the rubble-strewn streets of Los Angeles as they are systematically being smashed to pieces by the Martian war machines is as terrifying and evocative a sequence as you'll see in any conventional war movie. The film does have some weaknesses however - none of the performances are very strong (except for Hardwicke's narration, which is excellent), the romantic subplot is strictly by-the-numbers and although the scale is impressive the budget does occasionally show. There is also an astonishingly dated but realistic sequence where the heroes attack the Martians with an atomic bomb and stand out in the open as the fallout wind blows through them, depositing poisonous ash in their hair and clothes, unwittingly exposing them to cancer, leukaemia and a dozen other radiation sicknesses; a telling moment of the world's then understanding of the hidden dangers of nuclear fission. In terms of all-out man versus aliens action however, this is a rich and very enjoyable filming of what is probably the most imaginative and influential science-fiction story ever written.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Period Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this when it was released, I was in high school, and was immersed in science fiction. I thought it was so good, I convinced my father to see it.Overall, it's a good film, entertaining, and with a prologue embellished with a Chesley Bonestell tour of the Solar System. For its time, the special effects were good, and it was relatively easy to suspend disbelief.I still like the film. I have it on both VHS and DVD.(Minor spoilers) One thing that was frequently present in early science fiction stories was present in the film. When the "skeleton ray" weapon is used for the first time, Dr. Forrester takes a single look at it and comes out with a detailed technical explanation of its mechanics! Also, when the Martian TV camera is carried to the lab, it's "hooked up to an epidiascope" so that the earthmen can get a Martian's point of view. An epidiascope is a passive optical projector: they might as well have hooked it up to a slide projector.Interestingly, a YB-49 Flying Wing was used to try to nuke the Martians. That really dates the film, since that bomber was passed over to the B-36. However, it looked more like the Martian craft than any other aircraft. (Why to people say they look like swans? Check out Manta rays.) There have been far worse films. This one's still enjoyable.In contrast to the recent Spielberg War of the Worlds, this one has a clearer plot. The scientist on vacation learns of one of the earliest invaders, and brings back data to his colleagues. He and they try to take action against the invaders, and one even discovers a hint as to how they could be defeated (the sample of the aliens' blood). The more recent film bypasses this completely, and just has the protagonist running away with his children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In The Top Ten All-Time Sci-Fi Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the late 1970's, I had occasion to meet Ann Robinson, co-star of WAR OF THE WORLDS at a science fiction convention in San Jose, Ca. She recounted her experiences during the filming of this all-time classic science fiction film...She said the entire production, as hard as it is to believe, was filmed on a single studio sound stage, except for one or two location shots in Arizona. Robinson was 19 then and said her first impression upon seeing the studio preparations--scenery, complex lighting system, etc., was that it was completely senseless and crazy: props and rolling camera tracks criss-crossing in every direction, hills and mounds seemingly disjointed. Robinson thought from the very beginning that, "This movie will never make it. It's too insane." About half way through production, she realized WAR OF THE WORLDS was going to be something special.Comparison's between the H.G. Wells novel of the 1890's and the 1953 classic film will always be made: From England to southern California; from the Victorian age to the contemporary age; from the use of "primitive" war weapons over a hundred years ago to the use of what was, for the early 1950's, modern military technology undreamed of when Wells wrote the the story. But using the novel's original time frame would have created a flat and unimaginative cinematic experience. Bringing WAR OF THE WORLDS to the screen in 1953 meant nothing less than unleashing the known technology of the early Cold War era from jet fighters to the atom bomb. And that, in turn, required a sophisticated setting with all the trimmings----scientists with technological savy, and a major American metropolis for the invaders to conquer.George Pal's trailblazing special effects were nothing less than spectacular for 1953 cinema. Audiences were stunned at the ground- breaking realism of the Martian machines and their destructive lasers as they blasted their way through downtown Los Angeles. Cedwick Hardwick's chilling narrative to open the film provides effective foreboding as we move among worlds in the solar system, finally zeroing in on lush planet Earth as the logical target for the Martian's conquest. But it is the story's unforgettable ending that remains one of the great ironies in all film and literature. Just as Mankind appears to be on the brink of doom, the end of the nightmare springs from the most unexpected and seemingly insignificant source. And in that there is a message: that even advanced intelligences possessing weapons of mass destruction will never conquer Man; for we can count on nature to find a way, step in, and correct even the most devastating threats to human life on Earth.An intriguing side point for consideration: the stock footage of "the flying wing," the jet aircraft which drops the atom bomb on the aliens as a last ditch measure to stop the invaders (very closely resembling today's Stealth aircraft: If the film was released in '53, then the footage of the flying wing is a year old and probably older. The point is that if the military possessed such technology operational in the early '50's, what does it have today? WAR OF THE WORLDS ranks in the top ten all-time science fiction films along with METROPOLIS, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, and others. The wizardry of George Pal has fashioned WAR OF THE WORLDS as nothing less than a movie classic.Dennis Caracciolo</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a golden era sci-fi film, War of the Worlds is a corker. It's got everything that a movie about alien invasion needs, soldiers, atomic bombs, priests and of course scientists. As with most films of this ilk I have a problem with these last two groups.So why is it that the churches were all relatively intact during the invasion? Could this have been a sign that God had actually put paid to those little green menaces, or merely that churches are much better built? In the book, the Phil Lynott said; `These aren't Martians! They're demons in another form! And I have been chosen to cast them out!' He then sang a song about the spirit of man. At least I think that's in the book, I've only got the album, but it's kind of about divine intervention anyway.Now, bearing in mind that these scientists are running around trying to find ways to stop the Martians, surely one of them would have noticed this. Using some quick thinking, some MacGuyver style construction and a few gallons of holy water, they could have created some kind of church/tank hybrid to fight off the Martians. But no! That would have been a bit too much hard work for those lethargic scientists and as a result of their laziness millions died. Well I hope some of them got their wages frozen and overlooked for promotion.Aside from my priest/scientist rantings, I think the film was top trumps and would laugh at anyone who claimed to be a sci-fi fan and hadn't seen it. Although that would depend if they were bigger than me and had any kind of criminal record.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic from the Golden Age of 1950s sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Pal took a classic science fiction novel by H. G. Wells and turned it into a classic science fiction film with Oscar-winning special effects by Gorden Jennings and crew, music by Leith Stevens, beautiful Technicolor photography, skilful direction by Byron Haskins (who did many of the original `Outer Limits' episodes), a first rate cast, and a sterling script by Barre' Lyndon that successful brings Wells' nineteenth century story up to the twentieth century.Sir Cedric Hardwick provides the opening narration, with spectacular paintings by famed space artist Chesley Bonestell which take the audience on a whirlwind tour of the Solar System. The characters are complex and endearing. Gene Barry (`The 27th Day') portrays a scientist who is both intelligent and enthusiastic. When he first sees the Martian war machines, he's as gleeful as a school boy watching a circus parade. Ann Robinson's character is beautiful, feminine, courageous, and intelligent. Other notable cast members include scientist Robert Cornthwaite and newsman Paul Frees (both from `The Thing from Another World'). Paul Birch (`Not of this Earth') plays one of the three men who try to greet to first Martians. The Army general is Les Tremayne, who did the opening narration for `Forbidden Planet', as well as providing narration for the amazing film, `UFO's: The True Story of Flying Saucers'`War of the Worlds' is one of the most well known sci-fi hits of the 1950s, a reputation it richly deserves. George Pal endowed it with the same high quality as his two previous sci-fi hits (`Destination Moon' and `When Worlds Collide'). Of the $2,000,000 spent on the budget, $1,300.000 went to the special effects. A must-see for all true sci-fi fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Effort in 50's Sci Fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think War of the Worlds is simply the best effort ever attempted at a serious adaptation of an alien invasion story. That the quality of the special effects still stands up to Today's standards is unbelievable. Half the effect in special effects are the sound effects, and the sound of the alien death-ray heating up with its harsh humming sound is recognizable to anyone who has ever seen a movie. I saw this movie when I was a little kid (which is the best way to see this movie) and it was so scary I remember wondering if the world might really be coming to an end. The aliens (silly-looking by today's standards) also scared me silly, as well as the creepy long silver hand crawling down the spaceship ramp towards the end. Anyone who sees this movie will remember images from it long after they've forgotten scenes from Independence Day, Men in Black, and Star Wars: Episode One. (Which I am happy to say I have almost completely forgotten about. Meesa happy! Ooops.) If you've never seen it and love sci-fi, you haven't lived. Check it out on the biggest color screen (with the best speaker system) you can find. It definitely belongs in the category of one of Hollywood's immortal films. Eight stars.</fullReview>

The war machines, which the designers based on manta rays and cobras, are sleek, strange objects, and the sound effects curdled my blood the first time I heard them. The movie is flawed with period cliches -- the cartoon Mexican, the piously sappy minister, the wide-eyed screaming bimbo -- which you have to believe the director could've avoided. Some of the dialog is stilted, and one scene where the minister walks slowly toward one of the Martian machines holding up his bible and intoning the 23rd psalm, and is promptly burnt to a crisp by the machine's heat weapon, brings me close to blasphemous giggles every time I see it. And of course the writers throw Wells's novel to the ground and dance on it (no great loss, in my opinion). But none of his matters next to the astonishing battle scenes. This movie is the paradigm for all the others that followed. A must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a sci fi cult classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nowadays, sci fi films are A pictures; back in 1953, science fiction wasn't highly regarded, though War of the Worlds in 1953 was certainly a cut above.Starring Gene Barry and Ann Robinson (both of whom appeared briefly in the 2005 version), the film concerns the invasion on earth of Martians. This story was made infamous by Orson Welles. When performed by his group on the radio, people believed the Martians were coming for real.Barry plays a scientist, Dr. Clayton Forrester, who is asked to look at a spaceship that has just landed; Robinson plays Sylvia, whom he meets at the site. Before long, the military become involved, and the Martians start destroying cities all over the world. Meanwhile Forrester and a team of scientists try to figure out how to beat them, when it's obvious that even the atom bomb couldn't do it.The special effects in this film are truly excellent for 1953 and very colorful. The only thing that takes one out of the film is the radiation. We know from Dr. Forrester's Geiger problem that the first site is radioactive -- and then the Martians start bombing. No one has any radiation poisoning.Some of the film clips are supposedly from "When Worlds Collide," which I did not see, but the world destruction looked to me like World War II footage of bombed out cities.Gene Barry was quite young here, handsome, and does a terrific job. In later years, he wasn't able to show much of a dramatic range as he always played these smooth, dapper types on television. But he had the capability for much more, as his Tony nomination for La Cage aux Folles proved.It seems like everyone on this site is raving about the brilliant acting of Ann Robinson. I thought she was pretty terrible, but I agree that she had one helluva scream. She was possibly directed to go way over the top -- and it sure was a great scene when that creature touched her shoulder. Her reaction is perfection.All in all, very good, deserving of being called a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry, this really didn't work for me. Two problems: I, like most people, know the famous ending. And the characters lacked depth. Gene Barry was pretty good, and brought Richard Feynman to mind. But all the rest was run of the mill acting. My favorite parts were the introduction and the second radio reporter wandering around with a Kudelski windup reel to reel recorder running at 15 ips. The intro did a good job of setting the story up. You really could imagine aliens wanting to take over the Earth. I mean, here we are with an extraordinarily beautiful planet, probably as fine as any created in the galaxy, and we're just messing it up. So it would make sense for some more advanced aliens to decide to wipe us off the face of the Earth and move in. Makes you wonder why it hasn't happened. Trouble is, if it did happen, an advanced civilization would find simpler ways to get rid of us, perhaps so subtle we might not know what hit us. Then again, how do we know it hasn't already started? There were several movies along this theme back in the Fifties that were much better, namely, The Day the Earth Stood Still and Invasion of the Body Snatchers, which, unlike War of the Worlds, was genuinely scary. I love science fiction, but I'm not as much of a die hard fanatic as some of these reviewers. What makes this interesting is trying to get inside of the Fifties mindset, and the 1890s mindset of H.G. Wells. There must have been a time when people genuinely wondered if there were people on Mars. If this were possible, it would be reasonable for them to colonize Earth.This is a movie that is best seen from the seat of a 1950 Chevy convertible in a drive in theater with a cheeseburger, fries and a Coke, with your girl cuddled up by your side. Maybe if you found an old car seat and added it to your home theater setup, preferably a back seat. Then add one hot to trot chick, and start the flick.On the other hand, viewed on the screen of a laptop, solo, kinda undermines the Fifties ethos. But don't let this, or my criticism, from watching the movie. The War of the Worlds is a work of great historical significance, in all its incarnations. Spoiler alert: The Martians don't win. But they do, eventually, get the last laugh when humans destroy their own planet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch out for those death rays!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This '50s adaptation of the H. G. Wells novel transplants the action from Victorian-era Britain to a contemporary Los Angeles, doing away with the mechanical tripods in favour of hovering alien ships with heat-rays designed to evaporate the enemy. As a fine example of '50s-era science fiction, there's little to dislike here, as it's a film that set the template for many other alien invasion flicks to come: there's a chisel-jawed hero (singer Gene Barry), a pretty heroine, an indomitable foe and absolutely tons of destruction rendered in a loving fashion.I can't help but feel that producer George Pal had a big influence on this film. From watching Pal's later movies as director, it's clear that he was blessed with two qualities: first a sense of imagination, which led him to make all manner of films with wondrous subject matters (such as ATLANTIS, THE LOST CONTINENT and my personal favourite, THE TIME MACHINE), and second a real command of special effects and an ability to integrate them into the storyline. The special effects in WAR OF THE WORLDS are wonderful and still hold up today, and the snake-like heads of those alien ships were still enough to provoke a shudder or two in this viewer.Spielberg made the inevitable remake but that film ? alternatively ponderous, sentimental and stupid ? can't hold a torch to this well-remembered classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The War of the Worlds (1953)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"We're going to need plenty of reinforcements.""The War of the Worlds" is the story of how Earth fought it's most terrifying and dangerous threat. 10 years after the end of World War II, the people of Earth find themselves confronted by an even bigger enemy: the Martians.The movie is based on the novel with the same title written by H. G. Wells in 1898. And even though the movie and the book are very, very old, the story still works incredibly well. In an era dominated by low budget B movies like "Attack of the 50 foot Woman", this is the equivalent of a modern day block buster, taking it's place at the very beginning of a line-up of great space operas such as "Forbidden Planet", "Alien" or "Star Wars".The sets are very well done and it is easy to forget sometimes that it was filmed in a movie studio and not in an open field somewhere. The special effects are surprisingly well done and the Martian spaceship design is one of the most effective I have ever seen, on par with much more modern versions and easily surpassing many of the later efforts. Maybe on par with the Star Wars Imperial Battle Cruisers, in terms of sheer awesomeness and effectiveness.In the first half of the movie the story is absolutely brilliantly told. The rhythm is fast, the story is straight forward, there are very little twists or turns and very few odd or questionable events. And even those events or characters that would qualify as questionable work very well, adding flavor and depicting situations in which the people of the time could have very possibly found themselves.But as the story goes on, the movie develops an identity crisis and doesn't really know what it wants to be: a war movie, a romance, a social drama or a political drama. And because of this little internal conflict, even as the Martians take to the skies, the movie puts it's nose firmly into the ground.The main characters are nice, pretty and good mannered (most of the time) and the actors do a pretty convincing job. There are a lot of minor characters who come in, deliver their lines and disappear, and there is a seemingly endless supply of them. They all do their job well, even though it is difficult at times to follow who does what.The historical value of the movie is tremendous. It is great to see a glimpse of the past and to see what the world looked like, more than 50 years ago. And it is also fascinating to be reminded just how far we have come in a very, very short period of time.The War of the Worlds. A good, interesting and valuable movie. 10/10 for the first part, 5/10 for the second.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a blast from the past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Red Menace strikes again in George Pal's colorful production of the H.G. Wells sci-fi classic, appropriately updated on screen to the complacent 1950s, into a society caught between the Cold War and the Space Age. At a time when backyard barbecues were all the rage, what chance would the hapless residents of a sleepy southern California town have against an armada of hostile alien invaders from Mars? Overtures of peace are answered with laser blasts; military retaliation is repulsed by disintegrator beams; even the A-bomb is brushed disdainfully aside as humanity is brought literally to its knees. Wells' pessimism can be both alarming and refreshing: in the end it isn't the indomitable spirit of Mankind that triumphs, but an insignificant detail of microbiology. Given the sometimes laughable stock dialogue and characters, viewers might at times be tempted to cheer for the Martians, who after all are just trying to survive in the only way they know how. Expect lots of unintended laughs, but it's all good fun, and where else can audiences enjoy the spectacle of Los Angeles reduced to smoking rubble?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true Sci-Fi Classic in every sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, 'Forbidden Planet', and 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' are among the films that started my childhood love of sci-fi. Here are a few observations that stand out for me about this film in particular:-The vibrant rich colors, unusual war machine sounds, and exceptional special effects.-The imaginative otherworldly design of the Martian War machines and the Martians themselves.-The build up to final total defeat of the humans. Even our most powerful weapon saved as a last resort was useless.-The depiction of mobs of people turning on each other rather than helping. Even taking the instruments from the truck that were needed by Dr. Forrester to maybe stop the martians.-I remember how surprised I was when the minister was vaporized by the martians as he tried to approach them in peace. Pretty shocking stuff for the early 50s, and even when I first saw it in the mid 60s.In contrast to the panicking mobs there were the later scenes of the people huddled in the churches praying for salvation as the destruction raged all about them. Followed by the sudden silence as the seemingly invincible Martians began to die. It was a memorable moment in the film.It's also interesting to contrast this films attitude towards God and religion with more contemporary films of recent decades. For instance in this film it is said at the end that it was God in his infinite wisdom that had saved us and he/she is given the credit. By placing on this earth tiny germs that we had long since become immune to, but that the Martians had no defense against. When I was a kid this was really a neat concept and a surprising ending compared to other invasion stories. Contrast that with 1996s 'Independence Day' a very similar film where again Aliens have seemingly defeated us with their superior technology. Only now it is not God that saves us but man's own science. Here it is a computer virus implanted in the aliens network that destroys them, not an earthly organic virus or germ. It was a twist on the 'War of the Worlds' ending. To me it also showed how man's science in the form of computers and the like have become what many now rely on more than a belief in God. Comparing these two films might be a revealing study of our changing attitudes towards religion since the 50s. Getting away from all that however. The film is just plan fun, with good acting, dialog and action. I don't think the special effects were rivaled till 1956 when 'Forbidden Planet' came along. I highly recommend this film as a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>77/100. Although it is showing signs of it's age, this is one of the better science fiction films to come out of the 1950's. It has a very impressive production, the acting is quite respectable and the story is delightfully imaginative. The color cinematography is exceptional, and although I love black and white films, the color enhances the effectiveness of this movie.The remake in 2005 just could not capture the spirit and character development of this one. It is never boring, and it moves along quickly. The score is very expressive. It deservedly got Academy Award nominations for sound and editing, and it won for best special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Eye of Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>H. G. Well's famous tale is transplanted to America and given a few Christian and romantic subplots, but mostly this is a faithful retelling of the author's alien invasion story.Watching the film again after all these years, it's amazing to see how many similar scenes pop up in both Spielberg's "War of the Worlds" and "ET". For example, the "tentacle with the eye" that probes the basement of a house in Spielberg's film is the same tentacle with the "fiery eye" that adorns the alien ships in this version. The scene in this film of an alien scampering outside a house likewise resembles ET running and bouncing through the forest. The aliens themselves, with their suction cup fingers and oddly shaped heads, look very similar to Spielberg's ET. The fiery hills in Spielberg's film are also here, though Spielberg mines the surrealist tone of "Invaders from Mars" for the nightmarish shot of a hill covered in red alien foliage.Where this film succeeds best, though, is in its more expressionistic moments. The alien ships are a toxic green, the sound effects are loud and menacing and director Byron Haskin peppers his film with shots of the distant horizon erupting into flames like a Hieronymus Bosch painting. Like Mezies' "Invaders From Mars", it's these surreal moments which stick in our subconscious. Spielberg's version may strive for a kind of "authentic", "documentary" realism (and he succeeds on those terms- it's a riveting ride), but this film is more nightmarish, more mysterious and surreal.The structure of Haskin's film would be ripped off in "Independence Day", but today it's unlikely that a "spectable" film would be made with this many subplots. People want to see stuff blown up bigger, but they also want the gaps between the pyrotechnics to be shorter. In a way, Spielberg's "War of the Worlds", like "Jaws" and "The Godfather" decades earlier, anticipates the future pornographic tastes of audiences. It cuts away the fat and get right down to the violence.7.5/10 ? The line, "...across the gulf of space, minds vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded our Earth with envious eyes" begins Well's novel. These "eyes" become the primary motif of this film. The alien ships are deadly eyeballs and the alien's themselves have a composite eye with a red, green and blue cone, just like early tricolor televisions. These primary colors are known as additive colors and when mixed to different degrees, reproduces most colors within the color triangle. It's unlikely that an alien from another planet would use such an eye, but the effect is strangely powerful. It's like some judgemental eye of God visiting earth and reigning holy destruction.Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film caught in the culture wars (sigh)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The flaws I find in this film are pretty much the problems you will find in any fantasy/sci-if or horror film of this vintage. It's small things, like Ann Robinson's character being the only one without dust on her after a nuclear bomb goes off -- done, you know, simply because "actresses don't get mussed in Hollywood." If you can overlook things like this, you should enjoy this film immensely.Ray Bradbury said in the George Pal documentary, that WotW did something very important among the films of its day, which is deliver something genuinely scary. Bradbury said that. Having gotten his legs as a writer in Weird Tales and other horror pulps before crossing over to sci-if, where he never left the horror completely behind, the great man understood and valued the undeniable universal power in striking a chord of terror.The effects serve the concept, and not the other way around here, which is good and proper. The alien ship design was and is a handsome piece of design -- far more elegant and suggestive of an alien design intelligence than anything put on film before Scott's Alien in 1979, 26 years later. The sound effects are right, too. (Contrast the sound effect of the alien craft here with Gort's extended carbine ricochet, for example, in the great Day the Earth Stood Still. I think you would have to concede that this sound, with it's nerve-wracking strobing and slow accelerating, is more "on it", and more effective.) Watching the film again over the weekend, I was struck again by the robust, energetic American shape of the film. Nothing fancy or arty -- just a hotly propulsive invasion yarn with suspense, scares, and destruction. No question, this is decent mainstream American studio film-making at mid-century.About the elephant in the room: It's irksome that many people on the internet (though by no means a majority) are so exercised over the religious or spiritual dimension of this film. I think it's primarily young urban hipsters who know it's cool to disdain this sort of thing, doing their obligatory generational checking the box. But in any event, it's over-reacting -- bordering on religious phobia -- to interpret anything in the film as pushing religion. Context is all important, and of course it is context that is so easy to distort or omit altogether in an online back and forth post venue.A preacher in the film is killed by aliens. His niece, Sylvia, whom he raised like a daughter, sees much that happens after this devastating loss from a religious/spiritual perspective which she shared with her uncle/father. This isn't a strain of credulity in terms of human psychology, or of character in fiction. A few scenes later, when a scientist says that they've calculated that the aliens will be able to wipe out the people of earth in 6 days, if they continue their assault unchecked, she mutters, somewhat dazedly, "Six days... as long as it took to create it." One can interpret a note of objectivity in some of the faces of the Pacific Tech scientists as the camera pans around the room after she says that. One has a faint smile. Another looks thoughtful. One has a look of pity for the girl. I can imagine the sort of people who announce the first time you meet them that they are atheists getting a blood pressure spike from this scene, the first of many. But within the context of the characters and the emotions of the film, there is nothing to get upset about. Much of the misinterpreted religiosity of the film is of this nature. It's character, not preaching. Sylvia, when separated from the rest of her group, winds up in a church -- which action echoes a story we have already heard about her being lost as a little girl and making her way to a church because she thought her family would find her. From a storytelling standpoint, another purpose is served by having Clayton's search for Sylvia take place in churches across town: in this setting, people are resigned, at peace, but in any event quiet and respectful, not like the loud, marauding herd that had hijacked and wrecked the truck Clayton was driving in earlier. A search among such a crowd would have been impossible and hopeless. The aura that exists in these places -- where these people, lost in thought and prayer, are far past trying to duke it out in order to survive at all costs -- makes the search credible, and the resulting reunion touching. One can question whether churches would fill to capacity if there really was an alien invasion. I think they would, because, faced with certain death, there are many people to whom that would seem apt and natural. (A Pew Report says just over 78 percent of the American public as identify themselves with a religious tradition.) Disagreeing with that doesn't change the reality of people's values and feelings. And, again in terms of larger context, I think this would have definitely been true in 1953.I submit that the WotW isn't simply something that an emotionally mature, reasonably tolerant adult can watch and "get", but that any religiosity the film possesses has been exaggerated by those with a specific ax to grind and agenda to push. Ultimately, such objections are dismissible as so much culture wars cross-talk.Nine of ten stars. Well-designed effects in service to a well-crafted, emotionally effecting, old-fashioned, all stops pulled Hollywood night at the movies. Work with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in the day and age, when Americans still accepted their submissive roles from mom and dad, this science-fiction story hit the movie screen. At that time, when audiences went to view it, no one had any futuristic questions to throw at the actors. Everyone could view it and not be upset with how the simple plot, the corny dialog or the stereotype characters could conjure up a well made movie. But that's what happened when George Pal directed this iconic film. Taken from the classic novel by H.G.Wells, The "War of the Worlds" became a major hit in 1953. The story itself takes its cues from the radio program of the same name and has handsome, Gene Barry playing Dr. Clayton Forrester an Astro-physicist who becomes our survival guide and invites admiration as our hero. Ann Robinson is Sylvia Van Buren his student, turned admirer, who easily morphs into his girl. Les Tremayne plays Maj. Gen. Mann, Paul Frees is the walking reporter and Sir Cedric Hardwicke is the films' narrator. For all of its simplistic hokeyness, archival stereotypes, puppet characters and homespun reasoning, this tale of a Martian invasion reminds us of what we once looked like, back when. ****</fullReview>

You will want to know about every single aspect of the sound, the special effects, and the art design. It's utterly amazing what the producers of this film were able to accomplish in the early 1950s. This film also has a rare heart that's sadly missing in current American commercial cinema, despite the annoying religious overtones that otherwise bog down a pitch-perfect script. The over-stimulation of today's sci-fi blockbusters, which favor spectacle instead of content, still can't compare with the subtlety in the original American sci-fi blockbuster. Peace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To me this 1953 version has the better story than the newer version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never been interested in the actual "War of the Worlds" story until recently, with all the advertising associated with the new remake by Spielberg, starring Tom Cruise. So, two weeks ago I watched it on DVD, and pretty much enjoyed it, and figured I'd better see this original also. Tonight I did, on poor quality VHS from my public library.I found that I actually enjoyed this 1953 story more. They are basically the same, regarding an invasion by aliens bent on destroying all Earthkind to use the planet for themselves. Much of the beginning, middle, and end are very similar in substance, although the presentations are quite different. And, of course, the endings are exactly the same. However, this 1953 version relied a bit less on action, and spent more time on the human interest aspects. I especially liked that they captured and analyzed a lens to study how the aliens form images. Plus, the quick analysis of a blood sample on a rag showed that their blood system was not as robust as Earthlings.These invaders were from Mars, and the beginning of the movie spent a bit of time showing why none of the other planets in out solar system were suitable, and why the dying Martians chose Earth, the jewel in the system.Gene Barry stars as Dr. Clayton Forrester, who doesn't actually do too much except find his girlfriend in a crowded church, taking refuge with others. It was nice seeing him as a 30-something actor. I remember him most from TV series in such as "Bat Masterson." Good movie. Now I wish I had the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The picture narrates as a scientific(Gene Barry) and his sweetheart(Anne Robinson) must to confront an invincible and impassive alien invasion;neither army,air force or bombs manage defeat them .No mind how many weapons are used facing them,the death dealing flying crafts are unalterable and imperturbable.The destroyed urbanizations,the deserted towns with the inhabitants getting away and the death larges rays which emerge of aircrafts and the martians themselves, come joined in an astounding special effects's spotlights. It's based H.G.Wells that stays as landmark in the sci-fi history.However have been made varied changes thus the war machines in the type of walking tripods have been substituted by a creepy flying saucer.Equally has been changed the location of original novel since London 1890 years to California in 1953 years.It's a overwhelming movie but there's also a sub plot of Gene Barry and Robinson's developing a agreeable love story.The picture deals about the survival of human specie,the basic issue is the humanity fighting an extraordinary event as is a martian invasion. It's a imaginative treatment of the science fiction's classic by director Byron Haskin making fulfilment justice to the nightmare remarks of a interplanetary war. Exceptional and breathtaking special effects of destruction caused by aliens war machines are realized by Gordon Jenning. The yarn'll like to science fiction moviegoers but is truly a classic.

		<fullReview>The War of the Worlds is an excellent science fiction motion picture that though even at this date in history provides for an emotional as well as intellectual experience.This film had much going for it due in principal to the machines,and ray guns,not unlike what even today might excite our imagination even if you will the special effects made this a very interesting film to watch.I believe the film actually won a Oscar for its special effects.The acting is worthy of note because it is not overly slick and though this is a motion picture we are not smirking as to who do they think there fooling.It is in a manner of speaking done well,however there is more to this picture than just the capable acting and the special effects,it is a story however stretched that happens on a summer night when meteor like events come crashing down to the Earth.They don't really crash however because as we are going to learn they somehow might call this a rough landing.These events unknown initially are occurring all over the globe and both local as well as military personnel are in a hurry to oversee this unbelievable event.That event is that these are in fact the equivalent of flying saucers and a question as to mans place in the universe is made real through the picture.I don't want to take this so seriously however Iam usually not pleased when there is such firepower made available which provides for an absolutely devastating realization that the end of the world may very well be at hand.Though this is simply an interesting observation the human attempts to defeat these martians is almost meaningless.We could not penetrate there defensive shields and as smart as some of the thinking is the martians moved to quickly for an adequate counter to be developed.There machines and weapons were clearly something that was beyond this worlds ability to understand and quickly there was the end of time approaching the human race,at least here on earth.This idea of gallant in defeat is in fact unacceptable, yet it is frequently employed as a underpinning to some such set of circumstances.This is not meant to sound dubious but the rub provides a glimpse in another psychology which does not include a meaningless effort.However this is what I believe is a double edged sword and that is why I really care for this picture.It is why these pictures of another era stand up so well over time and why even today they are still so very popular.If you recall there is the religious influence had in this film which provides for a deeply felt conviction as to who we are and indeed what we in fact believe in.It is usually hard at times to determine just how we separate the wheat from the chaff however this picture provides for morality that wins the day and the salvation of the world.When the Martians lose there grip and there machines falter,it occurs as they are but a moment from putting an end to our place in the sun.The blessing brought upon the human race caused steeple bells to ring across the earth as a real injustice was attempting to lay claim to our home.This victory had is not a victory as such but a miracle not of science but of faith.This type of underpinning is worthy of long standing value and as well the solution that the picture offers is worthy as a real intelligent alternative to meaningless effort, worthless and without resolution.The fact that the martians could not breathe our air without themselves dying as a result is not the only accomplishment but one of greater value is that they were in fact the disease to begin with as they sought to conquer in order to survive.That apparently is not the best answer other wise they would of prevailed and still the picture claimed we were the world who was dirty.Ann Robinson who plays a interest of Gene Barry is very moved by her uncle(the priest)who in his very faith sought the martians out claiming that they might be nearer the creator and should be communicated with-I felt that scene was excellent and why you want so much for all the bluster to knock there block off.A loving tribute to the cloth is had in this picture and very deserved,that is because we are humbled by the darkness and made to plead in the last places left on earth which are protected by our Father who art in Heaven.There is good reason to like this film and good reason why this film is still so very respected.This though is only the movie and the ways and the hows are part of the motion picture industry,not necessarily evident but not needing to be as we have a witness that is unflinching in his dare to the night.This is not about boasting or showing off because the near death experience is a bit much and as well there is clearly shown that though we were given a reprieve as to judgment the promise is that we have work to do!There may be some ability to define love or romance however that is not what here is most important and that is salvation communicated through the merciful pleadings addressed to Our Father Who Art in Heaven.What we have is the humbling characteristic of mercy and that is why we can love.It is also not stated outright but in a manner of speaking man is put in his place with a lesson not soon to be forgotten.A very commendable attitude is had by this picture as a result of this victory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the best sci fi movie of the 1950's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>War of the Worlds is one of my, if not my favourite science fiction movie of the 1950's. It is also one of the best, along with The Day The Earth Stood Still and Forbidden Planet.A meteor like object lands on the outskirts of a small town, causing a power cut in the process. The local people go to see what it is and it turns out to be a spaceship from Mars. The military are called to guard it. During the night, some local men are put in charge to guard it and a hatch opens, and three strange looking machines come out of the "meteor" and kill the three men. At the same time, more of these "meteors" land nearby and others are reported all over the world. An investigating doctor and lady scientist escape from town in an aeroplane and seek refuge in a house, only for a craft to crash into the house. This is where we get to see the occupant of the craft. They manage to escape from the house as more and more ships land all over the world. Even a nuclear bomb can't stop them. In Los Angeles, the doctor goes looking for the scientist, who have now fell in love. He succeeds just as the city comes under attack. He finds her in a church. Just after, the machines go out of control as the creatures can't stand stand earth's atmosphere due to the bacteria.The Doctor and scientist are played well by Gene Barry and Ann Robinson. The cast also includes Robert Cornthwaite (The Thing From Another World) and Les Tremayne (The Angry Red Planet).I have seen this movie several times and never tire of it. 1950's sci fi at its very best.Rating: 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a Bad film has much more in common with HG Wells' original story than the modern adaptation/remake Independence Day, which has many parallels running through it.Special effects: I did not find them that bad, again given the age of the movie they probably could be said to be quite good.In independence day, you could find things to laugh at or about, this movie is much more serious, and given that, just as enjoyable if not a little more engrossing.Worth seeing at least once.The Digitally Remastered Sound Track on CD is also quite good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still the best WOTW ever! Let's see what Mr. Hines can do.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my second comment about the '53 version. It's amazing how Mr. Pal utilized FX for a film shot over 50 years ago. And Nozaki's machines were way ahead of their time. In my last review I trashed poor Tim Hines for attempting to remake WOTW while jumping on Spielberg's bandwagon. Now it turns out that Spielberg's aliens may not even be from Mars!In the meantime, Tim Hines' film will be set in 1898, as Wells intended. Spielberg had better be careful with his remake. Why call it War of the worlds if the invaders come from "another dimension?"I hope Mr. Hines pulls it off. But the bottom line is: There'll be TWO War of the worlds this summer!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Their have been many Alien invasions, this is the best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Warning, may include spoilers)There have been many alien invasions through history, but the first, and arguably the best, of all them was H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds. It was a statement against British Imperialism and a good sci-fi story at the same time. War of the Worlds is also infamous for Orson Welles' radio scare, which played off the fear of war in the 30s.So in the 1950s, with Red Scares and Flying Saucers, it was the perfect time for a War of the Worlds movie.There had been a project by Ray Harryhausen to make one, but it had failed to get past a few models. But George Pal made this 1953 classic, and it was great.If you have ever seen Independence day (which follows this movie nearly scene for scene), the story sounds familiar. Aliens land, blow up various cities, are nuked (to no avail), but are defeated by a simple thing: A common cold (just like in the novel.)This movie has great Special effects for the time, and it's update of the 1898 wells story was great. Let's hope that any upcoming WOTW movies are also true to the novel (yeah, right.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best audio and visual effort of the 1950s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a time period in motion picture history when technical skills such as sound and visual effects were primitive at best, "War of the Worlds" stands out as a major exception.Admittedly, the storyline takes many liberties from the original novel (godless communism substitutes for the manifest destiny of the original) and the characters are two-dimensional at best. Still, the movie remains one of the best of 50s sci-fi due to the production quality despite the unsophisticated plot.The visual effects, given the time period, are better-than-average. The attack scenes resemble a crude American anime, almost in the Rankin/Bass or Bakshi sense...well, maybe not. Speaking of anime, so many of the AWESOME sound effects have been borrowed by so many cartoons and cheap science fiction films since that it is almost a pity. Sound editors have yet to improve on the classic shrill of the heat ray or guitar riff of the skeleton beam. 'Nuff said.As said, the acting is nothing to rave about. There enough stock footage in the film to make a documentary series and it is obvious that much of the battle scenes recycle footage. It works in some cases when combined with the animation, but not always.Overall, good 50s sci-fi and certainly better than I expected. There is no suspense considering the material though. 3 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For the time, an excellent update of the original story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take the original War of the Worlds story and set it in the 1950's. A difficult task, but one that this film does and does admirably well. The effects were (for the time) groundbreaking, and I liked the fact that the movie-makers at least made an effort to depict the unusual alien nature of the invaders as well as the hopeless efforts of mankind's best technology. Though not as poignant, the parallel is made between the ironclad Thunderchild - the most advanced fighting machine made by man at the time, according to Wells - and the attempted use of nuclear weapons against the invaders... with basically the same results.I would have liked to have seen more of the world the way it was depicted in both the original book and in the Mercury Theater radio translation in this film. Wandering through an empty, alien-haunted wilderness with the fading reminders of human civilization would have given it a wonderful surreal touch, but it would not have been really possible given the time - and the depicted feel - of this film.Still a great sci-fi movie - a classic, and destined to remain that way. I hope the next version can at least live up to the impact of this classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of the book is here (other than the obvious use of the U.S. instead of England). It must have been an amazing feat in 1953 to portray the Martian machines as they are. Of course, in the original, they walked on long, stiltlike legs, but when you think about the advanced technology, why wouldn't they fly? The scenes of destruction are amazing. They show no mercy. They are intent on obliterating every obstacle. They make no effort to negotiate, much like Independence Day, which is really the same story. Of course, there is an obstacle that they hadn't counted on. It's refreshing that this is the case. The military has had its shot; let nature see what she can do.I thought the escape scenes wonderful. I liked that the machines used a primary color sensor that could "see" into places. The Martians are mortal and without machines can barely exist. I suppose gravity was a factor, coming from a planet with little of it. There is a religious angle, of course. These are the godless creatures from another planet. They incinerate a minister. They take shots at the churches though their direction is random, not premeditated. People go to their places of religion in their fright. Still, even if one is bit jaded about this, it's probably what we would do.If one hadn't read the book, there would be a time when we would shrug and say, "There is no hope." It is at that point that one of the ships mysteriously tips on its side, the inhabitant dead. Humankind endures. But we are a bit more humbled. Perhaps that's what Welles had in mind; perhaps that's what the writers and producers had in mind. This is a very good film, done seriously, with a delicate touch, and an effort to be true to the themes and ideas of the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having grown up in Los Angeles and watching this film as a young child the scenes of destruction in my city were frightening. Even as of today city hall looks just like the one that the martians blew up in the film. There was a scene of huge tank just to the side of a bridge also being destroyed and there was a tank which existed for many years until it was finally taken down that was a carbon copy of the film's tank. Yes, this film has much killing but it was humankind fighting for existence against these incredible flying machines that even the most powerful weapon at the time a "nuclear bomb" could not even touch the shell of this machine. Mankinds only chance was to beat the "martian being" with medical science. One trouble with that is the greed of a man's heart because mobs destroy all the equipment which was mankinds only chance. Even in a crisis mobs only want to steal and rob. Just how can the human race survive against such a villainous enemy? Just got to watch the film for the surprise ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREAT 50'S CLASSIC SCI-FI !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rather than repeat the MANY [and mostly] positive reviews in regards to this timeless classic SCI-FI film, I'd like to SUGGEST A PROPOSAL to anyone out there in the FILM INDUSTRY [who CARES and bothers to read our amateur fan reviews]. Granted, even this 1953 film was a 'remake', and it has had a long history of related ventures: H.G. WELLS original published novel (1898), the "Mercury Theater Of The Air' broadcast by ORSON WELLES (1938), George Pal's (1953) film version, the Classics Illustrated comic book version (1955), JEFF WAYNE's excellent Musical Production (1981), the 'official' TV SERIES (1988-1990), MARS ATTACKS (1996), an excellent comic book fantasy adaptation 'SUPERMAN: WAR OF THE WORLDS' (DC Comics 2000) exquisitely set in the year 1938 (written by ROY THOMAS / with beautiful art by MICHAEL LARK!), INDEPENDENCE DAY (2000), and now there are even rumors of a new STEVEN SPIELBERG production (2006). I believe that if this film is to be re-done, it should be as it never has been before - yet as initially as conceived.... set properly in the year it was created ... 1898!! We've all seen the modernist/nuclear versions many times over, yet nothing imagined could ever be more appealing or stunning to the eyes than visions of 'actual' Tripods, Horse-drawn carriages, steamships, locomotives, gothic buildings, farmlands &amp; townships ... THAT'S THE WAY THIS FILM SHOULD BE DONE ... with meticulous care ~ and taken from the BOOK!! It has NEVER been seen this way and it DESERVES ... NO, it DEMANDS to be DONE AS SUCH! That's my opinion and it's all I have to say. HOLLYWOOD ... don't screw this one up!! THANK YOU!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this on a double bill with the recent Spielberg desecration. Were it not for the juxtaposition, I wouldn't have appreciated this so.Yes, the effects are clunky by modern standards. On the other hand, in those days effects don't pound the other elements of the film into non-existence.This version is about sight. If it sees you, it kills you. The primary eye is also a death ray. The ship's sole mission -- those "mechanical swans -- is to support and transport that eye. When the eye becomes personal and enters the house, it takes the form of a tricolor TeeVee dot, the 50's idea of high tech invasive vision.There's no thumping. There's death but these are angel's death not grinding violence. There's a curiosity in the beings apart from their mission. And believe it or not, this camera seems more intelligent than Spielberg's... more Hitchcockian.Se "Forbidden Planet" or "Blade Runner" if you are looking for science fiction. See even "Fifth Element." Or see this, even. Stay away from the 2005 version.Ted's Evaluation: 2 of 3 -- has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

Obviously, they come from totally different periods, so in some ways they are hard to compare, but they are both wonderfully entertaining epics with grand effects, great actors and thrilling music (by Leith Stevens and John Williams).The re-make feels a bit more like a disaster movie than this one, and the 1953 one has a much better ending, they are the two changes that stand out to me.

		<shortDescription>OK for its era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martians invade Earth. Humans are outclassed. Is there any hope for the human race? Well...HG Wells' classic tale gets transplanted to the USA, and saddled with some contemporary (for the 50s) characters, and given flying machines rather than tripods: otherwise, the main story beats remain. The trouble is that Wells' story is a classic for what it is rather than its storytelling: everybody remembers how the Martians are defeated, but it is a singularly limp, anticlimactic, and dramatically unsatisfying payoff in Wells' book, and remains so for this version (and also Spielberg's version in the noughties). So what is left is the survival attempts by the humans and, of course, the eye candy of the Martian invasion itself.The soapy human shenanigans don't seriously engage the viewer's identification but, fortunately, the special effects are nicely realised, bright, colourful, and eye-catching. They're dated, of course - wires are visible, miniatures behave like miniatures (buildings crunch like matchboxes when destroyed, for instance) - but they are still quite good fun. They were, of course, state of the art at the time.This film is OK, but there are other sci-fi films of the time which stand up rather better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>War of the Worlds (1953): Dir: Byron Haskin / Cast: Gene Barry, Ann Robinson, Les Tremayne, Bob Cornthwaite, Lewis Martin: Science fiction saga about that invasion mankind has been anticipated. The martians have landed and the visit isn't a friendly one. The film opens in black and white and gradually goes to colour. A meteor lands on earth and although mankind attempts the waving the white flag, the martians will have none of it. They blast everything from people to machinery and nothing seems to work in terms of military retaliation. It is funny that they announce an umbrella force field shield that the audience clearly sees. The special effects were superb for the time with saucer crafts and creatures that look convincingly creepy upon an encounter at a farm house. Director Byron Haskin does a convincing wreckage job in terms of the massive damage done world wide. The downside is the acting is terrible. Gene Barry plays the hero who has less personality than one of the spacecrafts. Even worse is Ann Robinson who screams to the point where viewers will want her to lower the volume. People from other continents are likely kept awake from her constant wailing and whining. None of the other characters are interesting either. The screenplay does present tension and suspense as it brings reality to our unknown fears from galaxies far away. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

What is their "air" like (what do they breathe)? How primitive of a creature are they - what could they be likened to on earth? Did they in fact have a two or three brains as speculated in the beginning of the film? etc....If you just take the film as a "fun" sci-fi film then you are sure to enjoy this movie.

		<shortDescription>Stick with this still-solid watch instead of the remake - 62%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The brilliance of H.G. Wells' classic sci-fi novel is that each generation has grown up with its own interpretation. For me and most people I know, this would be Jeff Wayne's musical version that terrified my sister and I when we were much younger (and, frankly, still does!). For more modern cinema-goers, Steven Spielberg's recent big-budget remake in 2005 with Tom Cruise would have wowed them with its explosive visuals but it lacked the novel's legendary sense of horror and hopelessness. But on the silver screen, this is the original Hollywood version and given its sixty-plus year lifespan, it remains a remarkably solid watch today. Of course the effects are much cruder and less advanced than today's movies but there is a real sense of panic to proceedings. Like the 1956 alien flick "Invasion Of The Body Snatchers", "The War Of The Worlds" presents us with a terrifying account of the end of civilisation and how we're powerless to prevent it, despite our best scientific know-how and technology.The story is updated and relocated from Surrey, England to 1950's America. Our narrator (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) begins the film by telling us that humanity was unaware that from the depths of space, our planet was being watched by envious eyes. One night, a bright meteor crashes in southern California and nearby scientist Dr Clayton Forrester (Gene Barry) is intrigued enough and take a look. There, he meets local girl Sylvia Van Buren (Ann Robinson) and her uncle, pastor Matthew Collins (Lewis Martin) but the crash site is too hot to explore thoroughly. But before long, the meteor's secrets are revealed - flying alien spacecraft emerge from the rock and begin destroying everything and everyone in its path. And the best efforts of the military, led by Major General Mann (Les Tremayne), are useless due to an impenetrable force field surrounding the craft. Humanity's only hope lies with Dr Forrester's desperate search for a weapon to use against them but as the invasion continues, his quest for survival becomes even more pressing.Perhaps lacking the provocative realism of Orson Welles's infamous radio production from 1938, "The War Of The Worlds" offers today's viewers your basic alien sci-fi invasion picture, complete with flying saucers and men in odd-looking creature suits. But perhaps surprisingly, it isn't as hackneyed as you might imagine. The film's true stars, the menacing alien fighter ships, might lack the presence of the novel's alien Tripods but are astonishingly real as they float over the towns and countryside, laying waste to people and buildings with reckless abandon. Certainly, they're more interesting than the human cast which can't hold a candle to the effects. Barry, as the movie's lead actor, conveys the necessary desperation in his eyes but I rarely found myself interested in his story. In fact, once the carnage begins, the film's screenplay seems to give up altogether as though the writers were content that the simple annihilation of the US would be narrative enough. And it's the scenes of crowded people fleeing for their lives that convince the most, tearing over each other for the chance to escape.It might look crude and rudimentary compared to today's CG-infused gloss but "The War Of The Worlds" remains a cornerstone of sci-fi cinema. What it lacks in human interest, it makes up for in the mind-blowing effects of the highly influential alien spaceships tearing through southern California. It lacks the political subtext of "Invasion Of The Body Snatchers" but instead focuses on giving audiences a good scare via the ever-growing tension of the story. Personally, I felt that it ended too quickly (like the novel) and I wanted to see more of the aftermath instead of the ruminations of the narrator discussing the impact of the invasion. But here's the thing - given the choice between this and Spielberg's remake, I'd stick with the corny original any day of the week. It's the "Independence Day" of its time but instead of revelling in the madness of Roland Emmerich's festival of destruction, "The War Of The Worlds" reminds us of how we'd likely react in such a scenario - with caution, fear and desperation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Landmark Science Fiction Epic from the 1950s!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Too Late for Tears" director Byron Haskin's "The War of the Worlds" qualifies as the first cinematic adaptation of H.G. Wells' classic science fiction yarn about aggressive alien invaders from Mars that attack Earth and try to wipe out mankind. Produced by legendary sci-fi producer George Pal, who later produced "Destination Moon" (1950), "When Worlds Collide" (1951), "Conquest of Space" (1955), and later "The Time Machine" (1960), "The War of the Worlds" is not only a landmark thriller about invading Martians ranks, but also the first big budgeted epic about an alien invasion. Leading man Gene Barry became a household name several years after "The War of the Worlds" as the legendary lawman on the television series "Bat Masterson" that ran from 1958 to 1960. During his 50-plus year career in Hollywood, Barry made only two other sci-fi related titles "The Atomic City" (1952) and "The 27th Day" (1957). At the time of "The War of the Worlds," he was the top-most name in the cast. This large-scale movie received an Oscar for Best Special Effects for 1954 and created the template for sci-fi films about pugnacious extraterrestrials out of rid planet Earth of mankind. Pal, Haskin, and "The House on 92nd Street" scenarist Barré Lyndon have masterfully orchestrated the special effects and the human story. They forged a timeless formula here that inspired later movies, principally "Independence Day," in the depiction of war between mankind and extraterrestrials. Several differences between Wells' novel and the film are immediately recognizable. First, Wells' novel takes place during 1898 and is set in England, while the movie transpires during the early 1950s and occurs in California. Second, the alien spacecraft are cylinder-shaped, while the spacecraft in the film resemble manta rays with a periscope shaped like a hooded cobra. The Martians peer through a lens that contains three colors: red, yellow, and blue. Moreover, although the spaceships in the novel are vulnerable to human firepower, the exotic looking Martian spaceships in the movie are impervious to anything that humanity hurls at them and they come equipped with their own 'protective blister,' a force field that protects them under a giant, invisibly umbrella. Third, the Martians in the novel look nothing like those in the movie. Fourth, the protagonist in the novel is a Victorian journalist who sets out to be reunited with his wife when the aliens arrive. In Haskin's film, the protagonist is a scientist. The biggest difference between novel and film concerns the demise of the Martians. In the movie, for example, the Martians are defeated not by the most awesome weapons that the military can unleash, but through bacteria.</fullReview>

Wells' original story as any other version, this one sees a "meteor" fall to Earth just outside one of those stereotypical small towns that show up in so many 1950s sci-fi flicks. Gene Barry plays Clayton Forrester, a renowned scientist vacationing in the area who come to study the supposed meteor and Ann Robinson plays Sylvia Van Buren, a woman with her own interest in science, her own Master's degree and one of those great 50s hairdos. Of course, being a 1950s sci-fi flick, she basically turns into a frightened, screaming appendage to Dr. Forrester. After checking out the meteor, Clayton, Sylvia and the rest head back to the Southern California town for a square dance (in Southern California?) until the power goes out and the Martians start to emerge. The military gets called in, and if you've ever seen, read, heard or heard about any of the other versions of this story you know how things go from there.One of the first things to say about this movie is how well some of it holds up more than half a century after it was first released. The Martian ships look really good. The first clear image of a ship, supported by three flickering beams of electromagnetic energy, is as striking as any computer generated image of today. The shots of the Martian force fields standing up to artillery barrages is also flawless. Barry does a fine job with his role, given the almost constant play-by-play dialog he has to give and the silly-looking ascot he's stuck with for most of the film. The story also unfolds quite well, shifting from the larger Martian invasion to the smaller story of Clayton and Sylvia's survival without any scene overstaying its welcome.The most interesting thing about this movie, though, it how different the America of the 1950s looks compared to America today. It's an America of an almost unshakable self-confidence, a place where no problem is considered unsolvable if you just put your head down and keep going. It's an America where the government is capable of handling the most extreme situations with calm and deliberate action. It's an America where everyone except hysterical women keeps their cool in the face of Armageddon. Even at the end of the story, when the mob starts looting and panics as the Martians descend on Los Angeles, it's made very clear that the mob isn't made up of regular, normal Americans. These are the dregs of society running wild because their betters are no longer around to keep them in line.The War of the Worlds is also interesting because it predates the idea of the movie as "thrill ride". For a film about mass destruction and slaughter, it has an almost languid pace. It doesn't drag you from scene to scene on an adrenalin rush, but pauses to let you appreciate what's going on, even if it does sometimes undermine any sense of tension from the Martian threat.The War of the Worlds is very much a movie of its time, and if you think that time has passed it may bore you. But if you can disconnect yourself from the expectations modern Hollywood has instilled in you, there's a lot to appreciate in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 1953 classic still holds up after all these years! As a 12 yr. old, I was glued to my front row seat at our neighborhood theater in East Aurora, NY! (a suburb of Bflo., NY!) And had nightmares for months! Producer George Pal created a quality movie and cast, with an effective soundtrack. (I'd later work 17-yrs. for "Billboard Magazine" in L.A., Vegas-&amp;-here) and meet one of thee greatest Hollywood composers, Jerry Goldsmith. ("Alien," "A Patch of Blue," "Star Trek!") Fun fact: Legendary costumer/multi-Oscar winner Edith Head, was uncredited for this film! So: sit back &amp; enjoy "The War of the Worlds!" The remake, with Tom Cruise, is OK, but seems less personal and real than this version. After living &amp; working in L.A., it's-a-kick to see several familiar shots of local areas, such as the nearby mountains &amp; certain bridges.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>War of the World is one of the best science fiction novels of all time. It was written H.G. Wells 1898, and quickly became a classic. In 1938, Orson Welles was giving a radio production of the book, and those who were just tuning in thought it was real, causing great chaos.But in 1953, one of the greatest adaptions of the book was made. In my opinion, this is the best of the War of the Worlds adaptions, and don't even get me started on that stale Spielberg adaption. This film has great special effects, great story, and great acting from actors like Gene Barry. And thank God somebody got the aliens right in this film, in later adaptions, the aliens are crap, but in this film, they are just as they were in H.G. Welles' novel.Overall, it's a great film that I truly enjoy. It's too bad Byron Haskin's later films weren't like this, because this is as bitter sweet as my mom's brownies. Excuse me, I must go get's some.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Science fiction classic that trumps its remake in every way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is sad that a science fiction movie of the 1950's, an age where the money did not flow as freely as it does today, did not fear showing us the martian war machines as did the remake. No the remake wanted to show us Tom and family as much as possible, and not the okay, but not really all that grand machines that do not look like they cost all that much especially when "Scary Movie 4" almost had them copied perfectly on a much lower budget. This one shows you the war machines a lot, and you have good action between them and the military something the remake also failed to show us. Granted the main encounter with the military was one of the first scenes of the movie. You also follow around a scientist and I think his girl as they flee from one area to another trying to escape the highly destructive machines of doom. Their story is far more entertaining than Tom's family as there is no idiot son who by all rights should have died and there is no awful singing seen involving a father and daughter. No this one has a much smoother moving story, more martian war machines, and no Tom Cruise working a crane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Pal updated HG Wells novel to the contemporary era ('53) and moved it to California to preserve the films budget. The movies value comes from a few things I'll get to below, but too much reliance on convention prevents it from being better, and results in many campy moments, i.e. the whiny, girly heroine (although she does hold some token degree, and is allowed to drive now and then). The acting is often bad because the script is so extremely undeveloped. It features the usual poorly scripted scientific and military developments ("4 minutes to bomb time!"). It's not clear if the words 'laser' and 'forcefield' had been used yet. Instead we get 'heat-ray' and 'protective umbrella,' and my favorite 'protective blisters.' Stock footage is still a convention of the time, and cheats the movie of better sequences and a more believable global scale. The major reason no one has seen this is the cast of B grade actors.But the look of the film is very memorable. It's clear the creative team enjoyed themselves working out the color palette. The movie has a lot of fun with saturated colors. Everything looks ultra-crisp and toy-like. Sometimes that's kind of cool, sometimes it just feels weird and artificial.What's pretty clear, is that all the attention that couldn't be spared for the script, has been displaced onto the nice design of the effects; and yes, the movie is worth seeing for those scenes, which are vivid, memorable, and often composed in striking tableaux, i.e., the crafts hovering over a demolished farmhouse with meteors crashing behind them.Some moments of vivid cruelty are also pretty sweet, given that it's the fifties, the blandest era ever recorded, and this stuff didn't get shown too much. The alien design is phony but pretty interesting.The levitating martian craft are distinctive, but the tripods from the book (or the other movie) are much more interesting to look at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Martians Are Coming, The Martians Are Coming,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set on the cusp of cold-war paranoia, the Martians are almost an embodiment of communism. They're cold, ruthless, hell-bent on world domination. And they turn-up where you least expect them. Cue the McCarthy bomb.That aside, this was the first real attempt to produce a mainstream science fiction movie, with a budget to match. Prior to its release, sci-fi had been largely constrained to the cheap, B-movie bug-eyed monster routine intended to mitigate adolescent intimacy on the back row or at drive-ins. Gene Barry seemed an unlikely choice of leading man compared to all of the big-name Hollywood stars of the day. It probably says something of the stigma associated with this genre that the likes of, say - Richard Widmark, Burt Lancaster or Gregory Peck wouldn't touch it. In 1953, handsome Barry was still the stuff of B-movies. Gawky Ann Robinson was little more than his love-interest and scream-fodder. Ellen Ripley she ain't.Set in (then) contemporary USA, the movie otherwise sticks closely to the basic H.G. Wells premise, with the aliens arriving inside fireball-like projectiles. Number 3 still features heavily in their culture, but inevitably; the Wellsian mechanical tripods have been upgraded to a 20th century electromagnetic level. By the same token, a much more sophisticated human arsenal required the Martians to have some kind of force-field. If not, despite their heatray, they'd have been wiped out pretty quickly. That apart, the firefights, destruction and chaos are pretty much as described.For the most part effects are extremely imaginative. The intentionally cobra-like cowl of the heatray rises with a gradual reptilian grace from the pit. There are strange hissing noises, almost like those of a snake. The ray disgorges with a spooky chirruping noise unlike anything you expect. That first encounter packs in tension even today. The Martian machines themselves are wonderfully executed. They are a perfect embodiment of grace and menace. Slowly they drift into position like phantoms, with only their electronic hissing as a sound effect. Once again, the moments are wonderfully tense. Then the shooting starts.Instead of being trapped with a lunatic priest, Barry is accompanied by his love-interest. Which, despite her screams, is a briefer and lot less boring episode than Spielberg's later interpretation.The attack on Los Angeles is very neatly done. Some of the effects still stand up - or perhaps fall down - well, even today. The possession of a force-field precluded any need to use the poisonous gas which featured in the novel. One suspects that its appearance would have been a little too close to the knuckle during the cold war climate.The script is pretty unimaginative and typical for its time. Apart form the opening prologue, non of it comes from the novel. Which is hardly surprising as some half a century separates the fictitious theatres. Acting is likewise wooden and unconvincing, though Barry does have his moments. Several of the set-pieces resemble the landscape from a model railway. And, of course, despite the flashing lights and smoke, we can all see the strings holding up the Martian machines. A lot more could have been done. (Oddly, I saw this movie at the cinema around 1960, and didn't notice the strings at all, not even on the big screen.)Even so, it is still worthy of a watch. Spielberg's 2005 effects are, naturally, top-drawer. As you would expect. But they are the only part of his recent adaptation that hold one's attention. His dead-beat-dad-with-dysfunctional-family scenario otherwise reduces it to little more than a social-services training guide. Of the two movies, the 1953, version is definitely the least irritating. Never once did I feel obliged to mute the sound.Strings notwithstanding, 'War Of The Worlds' took the 1953 Oscar for special effects, and deservedly so. More important, it gave science fiction a first genuine seal of establishment approval. Bug-eyed monsters had finally come of age.Ironically; today you can buy Spielberg's dire but lavish 2005 effort more cheaply than you can the 1953 near-classic original. I think that says it all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I keep reading comments over and over about this movie being excellent. Well, they are all wrong! This movie is well above excellent. From it's plot and human situations (there are people in the Spielberg movie that are creepier than the aliens) to the special effects (the meteors and ships in threes) this movie has it 'all over' anything ever made. And, how about the people in the small town near where Doctor Forrester was fishing, they are all likable. The movement of the ships, the timing of their advances, the use of the two types of weapons on the ships, all set up the suspense and the ensuing battles perfectly. To this day I am still in love with those ships, despite the fact that they were war machines. Every year I watch this 1953 version and every year I appreciate it more. Also, it seems current movies are built around a dysfunctional family or a 'mentally/emotionally struggling' lead character. I enjoyed the 'light' love story in this early version. Somebody please, make us good movies again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full Scale Destruction of Civilization!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This science fiction picture hits it out of the park as first impressions. After you first see it, especially if you're a kid, your mind is swelled up with visions of buildings being blown apart and the army getting blasted to pieces. You also realize, since this came out way back in '53, that it was very influential on the sf genre, in terms of alien technology, such as death rays - those exotic weapons that actually disintegrate things and people ("The Day the Earth Stood Still", from '51, was another early use of such weapons). But this War of the Worlds was in color; this was where much of the 'death by alien weapons' can be traced back to. The story was updated from the original HG Wells novel to present-day California, which upset Wells' purists. But it was actually a clever decision; the threat to modern-day America and the rest of the world made the picture more frightening - much like the radio show by Orson Welles in '38, the threat seemed immediate and less improbable.Since the story does take place in the present time (for 1953 viewers), we get to see the full might of the modern armed forces leveled against the invaders, up to and including the atom bomb. The story doesn't hold back; unlike many other alien invasion stories, which show a very limited scope of the invasion (i.e.small group of survivors) either due to budget reasons or story conceptions, this film goes all out. We see the effect of the invasion on the entire world (for example, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France toppling) through clever use of photos, stock footage and narration. We are in the center of operations making decisions at the highest levels for how to combat the invaders (even the big budget remake last year concentrated on the main character &amp; his family; we are left guessing as to what everyone else, including our leaders, are doing). We also see real footage of mass evacuations from big cities, such as L.A., lending a scope and scale to this type of picture rarely seen before or after ("Independence Day" in '96 went for this scope, as well).The picture has dated pretty well, so far; I think a lot of this has to do with the aforementioned use of modern weapons, especially the atomic bomb. On the other hand, there is a strong biblical slant to the narration, some of the characters, and to the conclusion, since this was the fifties. But even in this case, one of the early victims of the aliens seemed to shield himself with a bible, to no avail; I remember I was a bit shocked when I first saw this scene. This is a pretty exciting, fast-moving tale of mass destruction and still one of the ones to beat for sheer thrills.</fullReview>

The war machines are very different which I think the 2005 ones are much like the books perspective then the 1953 version, but I must say I think the 1953 one is pretty good to. The plots are totally different. The scientist studying these creatures is from the 1953 version and the 2005 version is about a guy and his family trying to survive which is kind of hard. Their are major similarities and then major differences. My over all raiting for the 2005 movie is a 10 and this is a 9. I really thought this one was advanced for its time but it still went way to fast, and didn't really have any great ideas and a good plot line.</fullReview>

Not having seen the movie in several years, I was surprised that it wasn't as slow as I had remembered it being. The pacing, while somewhat slow at the beginning, quickly picks up and off you go. This is timeless entertainment, the script holds up very well, the sound effects of the hovering Martian machines still give you the creeps, I just wish the restoration would have erased those damned wires attached to the spaceships!

		<fullReview>I think, a lot of people knows the effect: When you see a movie as an adult again, that mesmerized you as a young kid, the very most of the old magic is unfortunately gone and you wonder, how this old movie had you captivate when you was a child. Only very few movies are able to pass this ultimate "test of time". Until today, i know only one movie, that hold its level 100%, when i first saw it when i was 5 or 6 years old, and then 30 years later again. But some other movies get close to it. "The War of the Worlds" (TWOTW) is one of my personal favorites of this childhood-films.TWOTW holds approximately 80% of its childhood magic for me. I saw it first on TV, when i was 8 or 9 years old, and it scared and mesmerized me at the same time. At this time VCR was not available or too expensive, and this kind of movies was aired only after midnight on TV. My father knew my love for this kind of films, and waked me up so that i can saw it. I remember myself sitting in front of our old little B/W TV in our dark living room, i remember the eerie "dinnnng....dinnnng..." of the infernal martian machines. The blasting heat ray with its awful sound and the ashes of the first, exterminated welcoming committee, that was send to the landing site...All of this movie seems to be so real, the special effects was awesome. And in spite of the happy ending, my sleep after this film was full of accordingly nightmares! But i won't miss this experience. When i saw it again on DVD (and in color) after approx. 27 years, it lost only little of its power that mesmerized me as a child. Okay, today you can see some of the effects that you overlooked as a child, detecting some fine wires that holding the machines and you realize, that the energy-fields of the ships was made of glass-bowls, but it is still a very, very good movie and it really deserves to became a classic. Spielbergs version of this story that now playing in 2005 is well made too, but the immortal classic from George Pal Spielberg can't surpass! I give it 8 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The War of the Worlds stars Gene Barry as a scientist who happens to be in the area when Martian spaceships land. It's an invasion of the earth by their flying machines with green ray guns. Sci-fi fans consider this one of the better sci-fi movies of the 1950's. The visual effects won an Oscar. They don't look that great today but there is something ominous about the sounds of those hovering Martian machines and the their death rays. There is a very tense moment when Barry and his girlfriend hide in a farmhouse with the machines probing around for them. The War of the Worlds is worth seeing, especially if you've already seen the Spielberg/Tom Cruise remake of 2005.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starting off in year 1936 with a radio broadcast this movie really brings out the suspense of fear and confusion. Starting out in Nevada we see a huge meteorite hit ground. The towns folk get all questiony and such. Then we see the ships. The aliens come out later in the film. They look more like bigger versions of ET. That's all I'm going to say. I recommend watching this and Tim Burtons 2005 remake. I wouldn't recommend letting young children watch this. As it does have a few minor horrific scenes. But nothing dramatic or gross. Just a lot of deaths. Even an alien death is seen. I'd watch it in the nighttime. It's more scary and more interesting then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't compare this film to the recent remake simply because they are two very different tellings of H.G. Wells' story, and deserve to be looked at in different manners. This film, while not free of some silly dialog or FX goofs (I.E. suspension strings!), it remains to me the single most convincing science fiction invasion film I have ever seen; there are a number of reasons for this.First: The dialog, as mentioned, is silly at times, but for a 1950's sci-fi film, the acting is generally top-notch. While Gene Barry's Clayton Forrester maintains the same expression throughout the entire film (which irks some viewers, understandably), he at least remains believable as a scientist who is dumbfounded and awestruck that earth is being invaded. Other roles in the film range from semi believable to very believable, and the panic and sorrow that the invasion creates feels genuine as well, unlike most films from the era where panic is portrayed by women clutching their cheeks and screaming helplessly.Second: The effects hold up. Yes, we know the war machines are models, and here and there we are reminded of that. But thanks to wonderfully detailed craftsmanship, as well as good set lighting, the machines are nonetheless very convincing, and effectively menacing. The first battle scene between the Martians and the Army feels so real, with so much noise, confusion and destruction (for a movie of that era), I determine how much I appreciate all other films depicting battle between the human race and aliens by comparing them to this scene.Finally: The feel of the film is genuine. It is creepy, dreary, and just plain well done. The music is one aspect which dates it, but it remains an essential part of the experience, creating a feel of urgency, depression and eeriness, as if it knows the end of the world is near. One thing I will compare to this film in Spielberg's latest is the feeling of mass panic. While we do see people running and fleeing on an epic scale in both, in the latest, it feels all too convenient for a good action scene. In this version, it feels desperate and real.Is it worth seeing after having the hype of the remake still present in our consciousness? Yes, considering two things: First, the remake pays homage to this film in a number of scenes, with some aspects that never appeared in the book (such as the nature of what happens in the basement scene). It's fun to go back and look at what originally gave Spielberg some of his ideas. Second, while everyone has their favorite S/F movie which they're biased towards, and this one is obviously mine, I still believe this is the most well-made piece of cinema depicting a hostile alien invasion ever to come out of the fifties and sixties. I still look at the effects and am amazed that it was made in 1953. It's a rare thing when watching a 1950's science fiction movie and the word "cheesy" pops up in my head fewer than three times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Byron Haskin's Masterpiece; a Low-Budget Sci-Fi Classic That Looks Expensive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This unpretentious and beautifully-directed Byran Haskin mounting of Herbert George Wells' "War of the Worlds" has become a classic with viewers. At every point it is Haskin's imagination, use of 1950's era special-effects (his other profession) and general skill at fluid narrative photography that makes this a truly superior effort. The screenplay by Barre Lyndon is intelligent, the dialogue often above-average. Edith Head did the costumes, Wally Westmore the makeup. In this sumptuous-looking colorful "B" production from sci-fi veteran George Pal's team, Leith Stevens' music stands out, George Barnes's cinematography, the art direction, sets, monsters and lighting (particularly). Salted throughout the film are familiar faces, such as Ralph Dumke, Robert Rockwell, Henry Brandon, Ned Glass and others. The stars are Gene Barry and Ann Robinson, with long narration by Cedric Hardwicke. Others in the supporting cast include Les Tremayne as the military officer defending Los Angles, Robert Cornthwaite and Sandro Giglio as fellow scientists, Lewis Martin as Robinson's Uncle Matthew, Jack Khruschen, Paul Birch and Bill Phipps as over-curious watchmen and many others. The development of the storyline is unusual. Phenomena begin affecting a portion of California where a flaming meteor crashed. Dr. Clayton Forrester is with hunters in the area and investigates. While he is meeting Abigail Van Buren and her Rev. Uncle, Matthew Collins, he is attracted--and then witnesses the breakout of the machine that only looked like a meteor. Other meteor landings are reported. The situation worsens. There are such alien machines all over the world; ; landing in vics of three; the tanks within them move out--and nothing is heard thereafter. Military force is tried, including an atom bomb, and the aliens, who are from Mars, are undamaged. Uncle Matt, with more religious zeal than sense, tried to approach the machines, and was killed. He takes her with him in an airplane, heading back for his Institute to devise a means of defense. Their plane crashes due to alien effects, and they spend the night in a deserted house; the aliens find them there and one touches Abby, who screams; Forrester counterattacks the thing and breaks off a piece. They then make it to the Institute where the fragment is frantically studied by the team holding out there. Los Angeles rapidly becomes a panicked city. The United Nations are helpless; and when the Institute's truck is prepared for evacuation, he find the streets filled with fear-filled-desperate types, is robbed of the truck and left behind. He wanders the streets of Los Angeles, seeking the others and Abby, who promised to wait for him. He finds her in a church where people are praying for deliverance. And Earth's citizens ARE delivered--the germs in Earth's biosphere cause them with their thin blood and lack of antibodies to sicken and die; so their flying-tank machines crash to Earth; and the crisis ends. The major error in the piece is the amount of panic allowed in Forrester's demeanor. Robinson is very good in her first major role; and most of the supporting cast are well-presented but not given much to do. The famous scenes such as the square dance, the investigation of the alien machine, what happens to the three guards set over the machine, the attack of the aliens/machines on the military defenders, Uncle Matt's suicidal try for peace, the riot scenes in L.A., the U.N montage, and others are quite famous. This is a very entertaining film, made as ad adventure by one of the best users of a camera in history. Exciting and different.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just great. Effects are 50 years old, but the film is vastly superior to the 2005 rip off. EFX department head, Gordon Jennings, passed away before this film was released and later won an Academy Award for special effects.I saw this movie in 1953 with my dad. I was just four years old at the time. Scared to to death. This film was produced by George Pal for a reported $2 million. A substantial budget for that time.Does anyone know if any out-takes exist from this film? Worth renting or owning.I would like to see Paramount re-release this movie with the piano wires used to support the war machines removed. That is possible now. Include all photos from the Paramount archives. Strike the re-release from an IB Technicolor print with the replaced stereo sound track used on a few of the later runs as theatres were getting ready for Cinemascope from fox.Thanks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Current video version is lacking but help is on the way!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally we're getting a special collector's edition DVD of the 1953 George Pal version of "The War of the Worlds." It is due Novmeber 1, 2005 and if it has the stereo soundtrack, a featurette and comments from Gene Barry and Ann Robinson, I will take back every rotten thing I have ever said about Paramount/Viacom.By the way, it's a great film! Yes, the Spielberg re-imagination is likely to be spectacular but this is the original classic that scared the hell out of my generation when it aired on NBC and ABC in the late '60s. If fact, it ran several times on both networks and was one of Paramount's most successful films of the 1950s. Released just prior to Cinemascope and VistaVision, it still is an impressive version of the Welles classic with exciting miniature and mechanical effects. It's the soundtrack that has been lacking in recent video editions.For some reason the region 2 DVD has stereo sound as does the LaserDisc version from the early '90s. Now the rest of us will hopefully be able to appreciate that pulsing, terrifying soundtrack that thrilled theater audiences in 1953.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The War has begun...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The image is all too familiar: the romantic couple, in their hour of desperation, come together and embrace in the sight of God, just as their perfect world comes crashing down around them. This image is just one of the more powerful scenes in 1953's "The War of the Worlds," a film adaptation of the H.G. Wells novel that was directed by Byron Haskin.This couple, along with our fascination with scientific technology, appear to be the running irony of this film, in that our superior advanced knowledge of science is of no match for the armies of invading Martians that look to wipe us out, and then call Earth their new home. In the end, neither science or some powerful new weapon developed by the military defeats the Martians; instead, it's bacteria and germs in our atmosphere that we've since become immune to.The story of "The War of the Worlds" was changed drastically from Wells' original setting of London to southern California, and already I see that those who liked the novel were angered at such transitions. Such changes, I think, are petty in such a way that the movie may have benefited from them in the long run."The War of the Worlds" happens to be a childhood favorite of mine, and is one of the my favorite sci-fi movies of all time. I wasn't alive in 1953 when this film originally came out, but I've read about how it caused such an uproar because it was released in the beginnings of the Cold War, when tensions were mounting between the United States and the Soviet Union.Not only that, but I've also read about the panic and paranoia of when Orson Welles decided to broadcast the story on the radio in 1938, and the chaos that ensued. In some instances, Americans had come to view the story as a frighteningly realistic parable of the communists invading our country. Indeed those comparisons are there, but aren't in-your-face blatant, as later variations would become in the future.The action begins when a meteor crash-lands in a valley in southern California. Dr. Clayton Forrester (Gene Barry) has theorized that all is not right with the situation, and is of course proved correct, when the meteor's contents make themselves known to the world by vaporizing three sheriff's deputies and later a police car with a white-hot death ray.The Martians and their Tripod war machines make an astonishing debut, wiping out everything in their path including man's superior military weaponry. The Martians' use of a protective "blister" or "umbrella" makes bombs, shells, and any other kind of artillery used against them ineffective. Later, as the events unfold, we learn that what's going on in California is not an isolated incident; all over the world, Martian Tripods are blazing paths of destruction, sending countless people fleeing into the hills away from major cities.Finally, it comes to what we've all dreaded (yet the scientists and military have no hesitation whatsoever), the A-bomb, which is being carried on a flying wing and is set to be dropped on the Martian nest that's been set up outside Los Angeles. When that plan fails, the military leaves everything up to the scientists, who then retreat out of the city just as the Martians begin their assault. And this begins one of the most awesome displays of destruction ever realized in any sci-fi flick...The performances are basic - not bad, not good - but are no more or no less than what's needed. The film wasn't out to win Oscars based on acting. What "The War of the Worlds" did get, however, was a much deserved Oscar for Best Special Effects. This did help it out, allowing other sci-fi films in the future to win Oscars for their groundbreaking special effects, like the big-budget alien invasion flick (that's also influenced by this film), "Independence Day" (1996). It also does something else, which I'll detail next.The film is quite chilling and effective in demonstrating the fear and paranoia of its individual characters, some of whom view the Martian invasion as the end of the world. Gee, it does look like it for a while in this picture. The scenario that it depicts in human reaction to a seemingly unbeatable threat is very realistic and perfectly realized."The War of the Worlds" is also getting a modern update this year by Steven Spielberg, who was said to be influenced by this picture and was recently named best director of all time for his life's work in Hollywood. It seems that his remake couldn't have come at a better time for him in his career. He can't possibly fail, especially with stars Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning in the leads.P.S.: If my assertions are correct, then the 2005 film also looks to cash in on post-9/11-era paranoia, just as the 1953 original tried to make money off Cold War fears.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably the best color scifi movie of the 50's (Them for B&amp;W). The first time I saw this movie was from the back seat of my parent's car at the drive in. The sound of the heat ray weapon rotating from the capsule was the scariest thing I had ever heard. I was on the floor for most of the movie after that.The first half of the movie is outstanding but when the focus goes from the humans vs. Martians to humans going berserk(?) it is a let down until the very end. But at least it doesn't become silly. Many times I have watched it only through the A-Bomb scene.Good acting, good script, and great special effects (especially for the 50's). I own both a VHS and DVD copy so you can tell this is a favorite of mine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George Pal and Byron Haskin's version of H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds loses little of its luster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While some of the plot and dialogue can get pretty corny, this is still a very effective film adaptation of H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds as depicted in '50s America. Gene Barry as Dr. Clayton Forrester (a name later used for the comic villain in "Mystery Science Theatre 3000") and Ann Robinson as Sylvia Van Buren do well in the romantic leads especially Ms. Robinson when she's screaming as she is frequently scared to death. Barry himself is compelling when expressing concern when Ann goes missing. The special effects concerning the Martians and their explosions deserved their Academy Award as even today they lose none of their effectiveness. This was a fine collaboration for producer George Pal and director Byron Haskin. P.S. I recognized Chicago native (like me) Paul Frees as both the pre-credit narrator and a reporter who mentions recording what he's saying for "future history-if any".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am on a goal to see all the sci-fi films of the 1950's, I took a film appreciation class a few years back and I remember learning about the 50's era when we had more sci-fi films then any other genre. Now I'm onto The War of the Worlds, based off a radio broadcast by H.G. Wells that shocked the world. I did see the re-make by Steve Spielberg first before I saw the original, Spielberg's version is actually pretty decent, but despite it's cheesy effects, The War of the Worlds is a great classic that can still give anyone goosebumps. This was one of the more violent sci-fi movies, the aliens are not just after a group or a couple of people, but they mean to destroy the entire world. I love watching these old movies to get the feel of the time and how the cold war era effected a lot of the plots or characters of the sci-fi genre.After a meteor crash, a whole town is just shook up, after the meteor opens, the people are excited thinking this may be something incredible to learn about, maybe a creature from another world. Well it is, but they're not there to party with the humans, they're there to destroy the world. Trying to figure out how to stop these evil machines from killing off the entire world, more die as the others figure out they're at war with other worlds.The War of the Worlds is a good film, I know it's cheesy, but it's all good and you just have to think of the time set it was it, when you think about it, this is actually a brilliant film. I thought the most terrifying scene was when the first three men who go up to the alien thinking if they surrender that it'll all be good, but the machine lures over them and just kills them. I would recommend for any film lover to watch The War of the Worlds, it was ahead of it's time and still stands out as a great sci-fi classic.7/10</fullReview>

He and Ann Robinson, who also got a role in the remake, kept us interested as they fought the aliens. Of course, they really didn't do much fighting as Wells made it clear that it was design by god that defeated the Martians.Of course the atomic science was laughable as they didn't have a clue.But, outside of that, it was an exciting film and just as good as the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Classic - And Better Than The Recent Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a story based on the famous British science fiction writer H G Wells' novel. H G Wells' depiction of the "machines" were cylinders with tripod legs like the one shown on the more recent remake of this movie, but in this movie it's a streamlined saucer shape. I think this version is far better looking than the one done recently. And for some reason, I also feel that this 1953 classic is more realistic than the CGI ridden 2005 version. The two movies are separated by 50 years of technical development, and this says a lot about the quality of this movie.Acting is top notch, and there are more first contact with the aliens scenario in this one than the recent remake, which makes for a more interesting screen play. In my opinion, it's also the best of '50s alien invasion movies which there were many. A true classic that stands after 50 years in its genre. Recently remastered DVD is of very high quality, and is a worth while addition to your collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>STILL the best version...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me and fans of classic science fiction, 2005 will be remembered as the year three filmmakers of varying talents -- with access to various levels of resources -- all tried and failed to make updated versions of this great film from 1953.Instead of comparing and contrasting the three new films versus the original, I would prefer to mention some of the things that make this film work.First of all, the scope of this story is greater, and even though it takes place in the 1950s, there is a lot more in this film for the viewer to identify with. The martian threat is addressed from military, religious, and scientific points-of-view. The individual courses of action that these three facets choose rings true even to this day. The military and government choose to use force, religion chooses to try peace, and science looks beyond the technical factors and instead attempt to focus on biological solutions. Everyone else tries desperately to survive.The art direction by Al Nozaki is one of the things that make this film so memorable. As the main designer for the fearsome war machines, Nozaki incorporates the popular streamlined art deco styles of the time to create unique weapons that are frankly more impressive by gliding than stumbling around on three spindly legs.The visual effects are also impressive enough. Even though suspension wires can be seen in a few shots of the machines, and there's one shot in particular when the reflective hull of a machine shows some spill from the blue screen, the composites combining live action with models work. Some of the imagination involving the technology of the machines, such as the skeleton beam and protective blisters, are effectively brought to life on screen. Of course, producer George Pal was the driving force to making this film. He was not the sort of producer who just signed checks and oversaw budgets. His background was animation and grew to help pioneer visual effects. That kind of technical competence by the producer is not the sort of thing one sees in modern Hollywood films. Most producers are businessmen, not artists. What can one say? It makes a difference.The little touches of Americana that are included add more reality to the devastating consequences that lie ahead for humanity's way of life. Things like square dancing, gathering by the radio to listen to the news, fishing, cards (or cheating at them), etc. It helps create a wonderful story. The acting doesn't need to be Oscar-caliber. Real people in real life don't go around squinting their eyes in the sunlight making well-rehearsed inspirational speeches. If there is the feeling that some of the acting is a bit two-dimensional it wears well with the characters being portrayed. It's nice to see such a mix of different characters instead of a bunch of clones. I also like the opening Paramount logo, which incorporates the news theme (as used to be done in film theaters of the time...news clips before the film was shown).The end of the film is probably well-known. The way it is handled is wonderfully done as things look as bad as they can be, with at least two people who have grown to love each other in the crisis find each other in time to die together. But, of course, the film doesn't turn out that way.Bottom line: this film is a timeless classic. The other films will be forgotten within a few years, lost in a sea of other shallow re-makes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holds up well after half a century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>52 years have gone, at the time of this writing, since this classic dropped into American theaters. With Spielberg's retelling rolling at the box office, it's worth revisiting the first film treatment of Wells' novel. Those who liked Spielberg's War of the Worlds are in for a very different movie, but one that they can probably appreciate, especially if they can think in terms of pre-Star Wars special effects.For the first hour or so, The War of the Worlds is a fairly dry movie, consisting of a lot of hokey scientific justifications for phenomena that have either been disproven or were never possible at all. Jupiter, for instance, is shown as a solid planet. Thankfully, it is fairly free of the racism that pops up from time to time in movies this age - though there is one unfortunate portrayal of a Mexican stereotype. As the mayhem begins, the movie is fairly satisfying as an action movie - especially considering the time period. Some early shootouts are fairly exciting, but as one might expect, the swan-shaped Martian machines roll their hapless human victims, and after a while some of the drama comes out of the struggle. It is a strong portion, but there are far better bits to come.It is the final third of this movie that earns its legendary status. After the fairly dry, birds-eye view of the war that has proceeded to that point, the end segments consist of a wonderful symphony of despair. In the midst of the evacuation of a city of millions, the film finds time to show us a child's ball bouncing down the stairs of a hospital. In the end, epic (for the time) destruction is contrasted with a humanity that it has previously lacked as Barry searches the streets of Martian-besieged Los Angeles looking for a good place to die. As he stops in church after church, the film finally delivers the emotional punch, the direct impact of such a gigantic-scale catastrophe. We see people coping with the most horrific of circumstances and see, though thin, the rays of humanity shining through. In the end, though the religious subplot may seem outdated, it adds the essential element to the movie's portrayal of a world that hasn't given up on God yet - and, as shown by the sudden and unexpected conclusion, that God hasn't given up on either. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The War of the Worlds is one of my top five favorite films. But, I have a question for fans. Bear in mind the recent airbrushing techniques used in the DVD version of E.T. to turn guns into walkie-talkies. There isn't an aspect of The War of the Worlds that isn't chilling and awesome. But, the clarity of the suspension wires holding the fighting machines is disconcerting. At some expense, the wires or cables could be eliminated. Some purist fans I've talked with are opposed to the idea in fear that a trend would start in which movies would be tampered with at will. Others think it would improve the film. Eliminating the wires would be the only change I would ever imagine for this incredibly classic film. As of this writing, a revised June 2005 release of The War of the Worlds has been announced; whether enhancements will be made remains to be seen. Your thoughts?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sci-fi classic, if you ignore book adaptation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you allow the fact that this excellent sci-fi film is a very *loosely based* adaptation of the novel, then you can appreciate this well-crafted movie. It's a cut above the usually cheesy sci-fi films from the 50's, though it can't help but contain a few things that seem silly and dated nowadays. As in The Day the Earth Stood Still, and countless other movies, as soon as the Aliens land, it's the Army to the rescue, who surround it with tanks and artillery, only to get disintegrated by far superior weaponry. Indeed, in this movie, Les Tremayne as General Mann does a dead-on impersonation of Eisenhower. Some of the dialog is pretty corny, like when Gene Barry and the girl are holed up in an abandoned house, enjoying their fried eggs, he says, "...you've just been in a plane crash and slept in a ditch, but you still look great!" or something like that. It's hard not to laugh. But aside from that, the George Pal special effects are way ahead of its time, the attacking vessels are incredible in their shape and design, with their heat rays and sound effects. And the sense of panic and destruction towards the end lends a seriousness and despair to the film which is usually not found in these sci-fi movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Front Rank Spectacle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not much left to say after so many reviews. Of the two general types of sci-fi, this is in the special effects category. (The other sc-fi type doesn't depend on special effects, e.g. The Thing {1951}, Invasion of the Body Snatchers {1956}.) The movie's main plus is spectacle, made more so by fine quality Technicolor. For example, those cobra-like tentacles emerging from the saucers are a marvel of design and color. Also, director Haskin blends the frequent scene switching in entertaining fashion. As his resume shows, he was not only an accomplished director, but a cinematographer and special effects technician, as well. Clearly, the producers knew what they were doing when they hired him. Acting-wise, the two leads, Barry and Robinson, weather the attack from Mars in sturdy, attractive style, keeping in mind that the main draw here is spectacle, not character development. Also, I really like some of the quality touches, like LA's deserted streets following the attack, the chaotic looting scenes that make realistic sense, and the little boys with their cap pistols in one of the crowd scenes. Then too, catch that slow tracking shot across military headquarters that shows the huge scale of Earth's response. However, I'm still puzzling over space ships that move about as fast as garden slugs. And a good thing they do, otherwise we'd all be incinerated in nothing flat. On the movie's downside is a smugly righteous miracle ending. It's straight out of the time (1952) when Hollywood was trying to prove to commie- hunters that they were as god-fearingly patriotic as the Cold War demanded. And I'm still marveling over the collapsed church roof that five-minutes later has injured none of the faithful. Oh well, I guess only doubters died.Anyway, apart from the ending, the movie belongs in the front-rank of 50's special effects sci-fi, and remains an impressive triumph both then and now.</fullReview>

I don't think that any director for the movie or the remake really thought they were doing justice to the original version, and the films are starting to become too old. The whole plot is ludicrous, and is only truly stupid near the end, when the scriptwriters were running out of ideas (and cofee). The whole church idea was probably just an addition by some corporate person who felt that his religion should be featured. The special effects are also not very good, but were no doubt shocking in 1953. It follows all the terms you would expect from sci-fi from the era, but it never gets insaneley bad as with b-movies. It was a cut above the other scifi of the time, and serves it purpose well, with little innovation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The War of the Worlds is a modernized version of the book by H.G. Wells. It tells the story of an army of aliens from Mars that come to Earth in giant capsules. They land all over the world, and out of the capsules come flying machines with a death ray. The martians begin to destroy the world. Meanwhile, a scientist and a physicist are working together to try and stop the martians, but nothing seems to work. When all seems lost, the most unexpected event occurs to save the world...This is an entertaining 50s sci-fi film, but it isn't as good as other versions of the story.This movie won an Oscar for special effects, and I suppose for 1953 the effects aren't that bad. Sure you can see the wires holding up the martian flying machines, but people didn't really notice stuff like that. The concept of the flying machines and the aliens was kind of interesting. I like movies about invading aliens, but I like to see what the aliens are up to. My only problem with this film is that it doesn't really focus on what the aliens are doing. I would have liked to see the Martians wiping out big cities all over the world, but instead we see minimal footage of the Martians flying and firing their death ray. Also, the story between the two scientists is kind of dull.The performances in the movie aren't anything spectacular. They're average 50s sci-fi movie performances. However, the acting might have been dull because the characters weren't that great. So far, the best interpretation of the story has been done by Steven Spielberg, but that is more of a remake of this film than an accurate portrayal of H.G. Wells' story. Obviously, Orson Welles' had an effective interpretation as well, considering that it panicked a whole country.Overall, this movie is an entertaining sci-fi film, but it's nothing too spectacular.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe flawed, but awesome for its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 50s, Producer George Pal was very much into Schi-Fi, and after his enormous success with the outstanding "When Worlds Collide", legendary director Cecil B. DeMille approached him with a very interesting project: The movie version of H.G. Wells's most memorable novel, "The War of the Worlds". The movie would be considered among the finest sci-fi movies of all time, and definitely set the basis for modern day sci-fi with its amazing special effects.The movie follows the basic plot of the novel, although it makes enormous changes too. Set in modern day (for the 50s) rural California as opposed to Victorian England, the movie starts with something falling from the sky. Although it looks as a meteorite, it suddenly opens revealing that it is a spaceship from planet Mars, and the invasion begins.Gene Barry stars as Dr. Clayton Forrester, a scientist who just happened to be doing investigations when the meteorite fell. After witnessing the Martian power, he becomes part of the team of scientist that will try to find out a way to stop the invaders. Anne Robinson is the romantic interest in this venture and while his character is typical for its time, she has very good moments. Barry is at times wooden and corny, but his acting improves at the same time his character does through the film.The most remarkable feature of this movie, were its amazing special effects. H.G. Wells tripods are turned into swan-like flying machines that have a certain deadly beauty. Really, the SFX are so mesmerizing that makes you ignore its flaws.Sadly, a movie like this is not perfect, and it is not because of the top-notch SFX, the main flaws of the movie are in the script. The characters are a bit underdeveloped, and the dialogs are corny; and not because of its age, the dialogs are corny for a 50s movie.It's biggest flaw is probably the way it changes H.G. Wells' intentions, Wells movie was grim and dark, a way to show the conquerors (the British empire) what it felt to be conquered, and the lack of hope. While these themes appear in the movie (for example, in a great scene when everyone fights for a seat on a bus), the whole story is about hope and survival, almost optimistic and somewhat religious, something Wells would have objected.Nevertheless, despite its flaws, "War of the Worlds" is a great example of how style and substance can mix very well. Great direction by Byron Haskin as well as great SFX would make this movie a classic of the genre and of film history in general.While personally I prefer "When Worlds Collide" over this one, it is definitely worth a rent. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where are The African-Americas in this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this classic movie and it's good in everything about The Martians are taking LA. However there is one question that the likes of Spike Lee &amp; Aaron McGruder would ask? WHERE ARE THE African-Americans IN THIS MOVIE? Other groups were represented but not one African-American. I don't have the answer for it. However the scene where the people leave LA was the footage actually used in a drill to leave LA in case an event like that was going to go down. However what happened to the African-Americans in the 1953 story, The War of The Worlds. It's better to hear from me than confront the likes of Spike Lee who did "4 Little Girls" and Aaron McGruder who did "The Boondocks". I have an answer, they left some place else &amp; no one saw them leave there communities. That's one answer. So ask yourselves, "Where were the African-Americans in the 1953 movie, The War of The Worlds?" Your answer is good guess as mine. Marcus Brainard</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When I first saw this 1953 treat....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of George Pal's 1953 original film version of THE WAR OF THE WORLDS, which is an exciting, suspenseful treat, drenched in rich Technicolor. I remember, as a pre-teenager, reading that it was going to be on TV one afternoon. At that point I hadn't seen the movie, I only knew about it from incredible photographs in monster magazines. I tuned in a little late, missing the opening credits. The TV station, at the last minute, replaced the film with a western musical. Here I am, ten years old, watching some cowboy get into a bar fight and I'm thinking "Okay, where are those flying saucers?" The cowboy then rescues a stray cat and takes it along on his travels. It's now almost twenty minutes into the film. The cowboy is canoeing down river with the cat, and he's singing about the countryside. I'm confused, thinking: "Wow, this is the most bulloxed up sci-fi movie of all time. Maybe the Martians are behind that mountain?"Twenty years from now, the same thing will happen to some confused young film fanatic when the TV station replaces WAR OF THE WORLDS with BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you can look past the 50's "charm" of the film, it's not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to check this out as I had the chance to do so, free of charge, and because I had heard a lot about the story. The story, originally a novel by H.G. Wells, was turned into a radio-play with Orson Welles, and was eventually turned into this film. Part of the reason for watching it now also lies in the fact that a remake is being made and I heard plenty of people talking about whether or not it would live up to the original. So, I sat down to watch this, and was immediately hit with just how... 50's it is. The dialog, the acting, the pacing, the story-telling, and in particular the special effects... all signs of a film made before the film industry really took off and found a good standing point. I would be lying if I claimed that it was easy to sit through. It required quite a lot of effort to sit through, and unfortunately, more than I had. I didn't pay very much attention to it, but when I did, and I filtered all of the hammy acting and lame dialog, I managed to enjoy a bit of it. The film does have some good parts, and some of the cinematography isn't all bad. If the film didn't try to impress the viewer through the terribly outdated special effects, it would be better. I enjoyed parts of the movie, and the main theme of the film is pretty good. I haven't read the original novel by H.G. Wells, nor have I seen any other film version of this story... and I (obviously) haven't heard the radio-play... so I can't comment on whether or not this is the best (or even a good) retelling of the story. But as a film, I think it's good, as long as you can cope with the awfully dated feel of the film. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has great moments, but it stumbles a bit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the past 30 years of sci-fi cinema, modern audiences have pretty much seen it all. Alien invasions, intergalactic voyages, gruesome future visions, advanced technology.you name it, it's been done. As such, a lot of the older sci-fi films of yesteryear tend to have a much weaker impact when viewed today. THE WAR OF THE WORLDS is a case in point. Yes, it's a likable and entertaining film, but it just doesn't have the punch of some of its better contemporaries. This isn't because screenwriter Barre Lyndon, producer George Pal, and director Byron Haskin had to update the HG Wells story (which didn't bother me, as other book-based movies of the time had to make big story changes) in order to keep the budget manageable, but rather that the movie's a little too genteel and occasionally silly.The plot, based on Wells' novel, goes like this: Cylindrical asteroids crash-land on Earth (1898 England in the book, 1953 L.A. in the movie), containing murderous aliens from Mars armed with super-hot lasers that destroy everything in sight. Attempts to make peace with these maniacs fail, and the aliens launch a full-scale war on the human race in an attempt to take the planet for themselves. Obviously, updating the book meant the story had to be streamlined, and the film does this very well. The dark side of humanity is nicely explored in a wrenching scene where Gene Barry's character (a scientist in this; a reporter in the book) is beaten and overpowered by a mob when he tries to get to a secret lab in order to plan a way to stop the aliens. Instead he's forced to watch as the mob destroys his truck and equipment. The use of military strategy is good as well, as attempt after attempt to combat the aliens fails. And there's a wonderful nod to the book when the movie makes lengthy mention of how the Martians favor England as a vantage point. (As if that wasn't enough, one of the soldiers knowingly smirks when he talks about England being attacked.great in-joke.) But by far, the best scenes in the movie are the full-scale attack sequences. The first battle between the Martians and the U.S. Army is masterfully done, with nervy scenes of soldiers in flames and glowing disintegrations. The death of the preacher (another nod to the book) is menacingly handled. And the finale, where Barry frantically searches the churches of L.A. for his lover and friends while dodging the laser salvos of the rampaging Martian airships, is thrillingly staged. This exuberant climax trumps the comparatively weak resolution of the Wells book.And really, what more can be said of the Albert Nozaki-designed Martian airships that hasn't been said? With manta-shaped bodies and flexible laser mounts that look like mechanized cobras, these vehicles are a vast improvement over the book's impractical tripods, and the brass-with-green-neon color scheme is great. (The humming sounds they make as they're about to open fire are wonderfully ominous.) And the FX work achieved with them is excellent. Except for a couple of early scenes, the wires on the ships are nicely hidden by smoke and fog, and the force-fields are done splendidly. By far, these ships are the real stars of this movie.So what keeps this film from being more than just pleasant entertainment? Well, the whole farmhouse scene (another nod to the book) is pretty weak. The alien probes look like that light-up Simon toy on a big cable. Even weirder, the Martians have those probes for their faces (are they supposed to be cyborgs?). And when the lone Martian touches Ann Robinson's shoulder.he just stands there and does absolutely nothing, giving Barry the chance to whale on him with an axe. (This is an alien invader? I thought the Martians were supposed to be totally ruthless!) The square dance scene is a bit much (where did they get those period outfits, and shouldn't there be something much more happening going on in L.A.?). Robinson's character is way too much of a screaming stereotype. There's a lot of overripe '50s dialogue (the exchanges between Barry and Robinson). And the opening credits suck. "There was WWI! Then came WWII! Now comes the war of the worlds!" (Camp alert!) And the flashing stencil font was really unimpressive. Even in 1953, they could have done a better job. (Why didn't they use Cedric Hardwicke's narration as the prologue over a starfield?) And while Leith Stevens' score is very good overall, the theme music sounds more appropriate to a jungle adventure than a sci-fi apocalypse. But above all else, this film has a real "been there, done that" vibe to it. If you've seen other sci-fi movies before seeing this one, you've already seen it all. This movie could have used less corn and more grit, because it can't maintain the threatening atmosphere of its better sequences. It is, after all, a war movie, and could have been done with more punch and verve. It has fine set-pieces and some truly menacing moments, but the whole doesn't quite coalesce into a great film.This isn't to say THE WAR OF THE WORLDS is a bad film. It's perfectly decent and watchable fare, and I'll gladly watch it again. But it isn't up to the level of, say, FORBIDDEN PLANET or THE INVISIBLE MAN, and its camp tendencies hamper its strongest attributes. Hopefully the proposed Tom Cruise/Steven Spielberg adaptation will bring the proper grit to the story. (Oh, and setting the new movie in 1898 England would be ideal, too.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Difficult movie to review this one...one of those type of movies wich can be classified as brilliant and at the same time an absolute crap. If we forget the book ever existed, it´s realy an excelent sci-fi classic movie, the special effects still look great, the movie is very entertaining ,fun to watch and far most atmospheric than many modern so called sci-fi movies out right now, but i´m sure H.G.Wells wherever he is now, must be wishing for a real martian invasion to come and burn Hollywood to the ground, because as far as books destroyed by moviemakers go, his novel must be one of the most trashed ever and shows how much that "America saves the world." syndrome has been around since ever. Anyway, at least despite everything we still have Independence Day, to show us that War of the Worlds could have been much worse than actualy is.War of the Worlds is a great movie, but it could have been a masterpiece instead, if it had kept all the original ideas and settings from the novel. Wouldn´t it be great to have had a martian invasion in the Victorian London ? Nobody has ever done a concept like this, and this book has been around for years and years filled with great ideas, wich were totaly wasted by the moviemakers when they decided to change the time period and the geography of the original story. Why in America ?! England would be the perfect place for a story like this as it was writen, why change it ? Perhaps because american audiences even back then couldn´t recognize anything else other than their own country. What´s amazing is that things haven´t even changed in this 50 years, so i guess general audiences are condemned to watch Hollywood rip apart good books to fit the american audiences lack of knowledge of the rest of the world.And this stuff ended up giving a bit of emptiness to the movie in all the bits where there is no action or special effects, because those typical patriotic-anti-comunist-50´s style characters have realy nothing to say. Gone are the colonization themes discussed in the book, and all is replaced by that 50´s fear and paranoia against foreign cultures as everybody in the states seemed to be affraid of being conquered. Guilty conscience for what they did to the indian tribes perhaps...Anyway, despite all this book destruction, this 50´s paranoic feeling still gives a charming and fun atmosphere to this type of movies. Who doesn´t love a good invasion movie, right ?...So it´s because of all this that this movie is very dificult to classify, but it´s a movie i would recommend to anyone who is in the mood for a good invasion movie as this one is realy the best ever, and a must see for everyone who has ever read the original H.G.Wells novel, because despite being one of the worst adaptations of a book ever made into film, it´s great to compare both works, as in the end they both ended up gaining its place in cultural popular history and i think both deserve the fame.But read the book first, if you haven´t seen this movie yet, because you´ll have much more fun with it just making comparisons. And if you can get it, don´t miss the Orson Wells adaptation, because it´s also fantastic. In reality, with this story, you can´t loose. If you like sci-fi and you haven´t seen War of the Worlds, you don´t know what you´re missing. Just forggget about the modern TVseries of the same name... And read the book. It´s that great. Despite every flaw War of the Worlds the movie is everything Independence Day should have been and it was not, shame being kicked by a 50 year old movie. This is how you do an invasion movie gentlemen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The granddaddy of paranoid Science Fiction!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Still the most succeeded adaptation of a H.G. Wells' novel ever and simultaneously one of the most influential movies of all time, producer George Pal's version of "The War of the Worlds" remains THE paranoid science fiction classic par excellence! This milestone is over 50 years old now, but still highly unsettling thanks to its attractive (and, for that time, extremely expensive) special effects and its very convincing portrayal of mass hysteria. Superiorly developed Martians explore the universe, looking for a better place to live since the conditions on their own planet become unbearable. An atmospheric voice-over explains us why earth is their only option and, before the world population properly realizes it, alien ships and warfare machinery strategically invade every earth-region. Even mankind's most advanced artillery is of no use against the highly intelligent Martians and our only hope for salvation lies in the hands of a small group of scientists. But they not only have to face the supreme enemy but also a petrified crowd of fleeing people? The original setting of H.G Wells' novel is moved from late 19th century London to contemporary California, with all the typical issues of that era, like post-WWII anxiety and religious influences. Especially the obtrusive religious speeches are sometimes annoying and also the wooden acting performances bring down the film's quality a bit. But no complaints, since "The War of the Worlds" primarily revolves on the special effects and they're simply GREAT! The slowly floating spaceships look very eerie (even though you can occasionally spot the wires) and even the evil Martians are engaging creatures, looking somewhat like the forefathers of E.T. with multi-colored goggles. This is perfect SF from the decade that ruled the genre, with other and equally essential titles like "Invasion of the Body Snatcher", "The Thing from Another Planet", "The Day the Earth Stood Still" and "Invaders from Mars". Steven Spielberg released a boisterous and super-budgeted remake this year but, personally, I'm not really interested in seeing it. Back in the fifties, they didn't need Tom Cruise in order to save the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The idea of an advanced civilization on Mars, expounded by Lowell, was discredited long before 1953. It is a bit surprising that a movie was based on an idea lacking credibility while the modern UFO phenomenon hinted at an advanced extrasolar civilization for years before the picture was made.It is hard to believe advanced invaders from anywhere would act as if they had failed to properly study their target. Really intelligent aliens would initially concentrate all their fire on Europe and North America, and thereby immediately neutralize the bulk of the scientific and industrial means which might turn the tables on the invaders. What was the use of attacking India simultaneously and wrecking the Taj Mahal? The third world can wait.The end is the worst. After repeated failures by Man, the "Martians" are beaten by microbes which "God in his infinite wisdom had created to protect the Earth." Are they saying that Man's science and rationality are worthless, and we should just trust in a putative supreme being? If that were true, it is remarkable that other intelligences had progressed so far, through science and technology, and act contrary to judao-christian teachings!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When will we see a remake???!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film a number of times and it doesn't get better with successive viewings.The film in itself would not be too bad were it not for the existence of the book. Many reviewers may not have read the original novel and it is highly recommended as a piece of modern science fiction. The problem is that along with other landmark stories of science fiction (i.e. "Day of the Triffids", "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" and HG Wells' other masterpiece "The Island of Dr. Moreau") it has suffered through being dragged into an contemporary American context (poorly excused as 'updating for a modern audience') that serves to reduce the narrative impact and a creates a lazy reliance on special effects to make up for messy screenplays. This 'updating' only happens because too many Americans are ignorant of events that occur away from their home soil (no doubt some people reading this will pigeonhole me as living 'on the edge of London').This is a particular problem with "War of the Worlds". Moving the action from the UK and pushing it sixty years into the future does nothing for the storyline, weakening the idea of a helpless and ignorant mankind and giving an excuse to use the American stereotype of a "lets nuke'em" solution. The characterisation is weak, with various parts seemingly wasted, adding nothing to the film - particularly that of the priest.In its defence, the special effects and colour printing are excellent and George Pal did much to advance the course of the SF movie, although he did a much better job with his other effort adapting Wells' "The Time Machine".Perhaps I am being overly critical as this is close to home (I live in Maybury Road, a few doors away from Wells' home when he wrote his book and less than an hour's walk from the site on Horsell Common where the first cylinder landed) but this could have been done so much better if it had followed the original story more closely. I'm still waiting for the time when someone decides to remake the film (no doubt with American money) in its more appropriate setting and not an American accent in sight. I can see it now: Ralph Fiennes, Jeremy Irons, Catherine Zeta Jones....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even if the dialogue is occasionally corny, and the miraculous deliverance somewhat clumsily staged, there is no denying that for me that War of the Worlds is a sci-fi classic. The story is great concerning the Martian invasion and the government's attempt to stern the destruction, the music is atmospheric and the acting is very good. Gene Barry is believable as Dr Forrester, and Ann Robinson is an alluring Sylvia. Sir Cedric Hardwicke also does a really good job with the narration. Also well done is the direction, Byron Haskin ensures that his extras convey a genuine sense of terror as civilisation collapses around them. But the real star are the special effects, they still hold up well after all these years, are really effective and thoroughly deserved the Oscar. Asides from the effects, the film looks good, the cinematography is skillful and the sets are good too. And the sound is amazing too, the scream especially is heart-stopping Overall, classic sci-fi. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original novel by H.G. Wells reveals the darkest side of the author, his extreme fear of extra-terrestrials and his hatred for all those who could bring the human "race" down, including those he considered substandard in the human "race" itself; all colored people, and among the whites alcoholics, the disabled in a way or another and other socially handicapped people. H.G. Wells was a convinced advocate of eugenics. This film reveals this fear and this aspect of his ideology. Try to find one single black or even Mexican man in this southern Californian community and in Los Angeles. Then only one person ever tries to contact these Martians, to go and speak to them, and that is a priest who is obviously out of his mind. All others only want to kill and destroy them, just as the author states that the Martians only have one intention and it is to kill everyone, to destroy civilization. There is not one single element to redeem that dark side. The end is also typical of H.G. Wells who had been trained in biology by the father of Aldous Huxley. The Martians are killed by the germs that were no longer dangerous for us, by these very small and dangerous little things, small creatures. This may appear slightly easy, but why not. After all the extraterrestrials were the victims of a pandemic that did not attack human beings who were immune to these viruses and other germs. But the film is rather simple and there does not seem to be any depth in the characters. George Pal still had some time to spend and tricks to learn before doing his surviving master piece, The Time Machine. It is true special effects in 1952-53 were not exactly developed yet and the zipper was often visible in the back of the monsters.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember when I was younger I caught glimpses of two films of epic reputation: the Exorcist and War of the Worlds. At the time I had heard of both films (and novels) and based on the little glimpses that I caught I was impressed. For whatever reason, though, I never had the opportunity of watching them from start to finish until over a decade later. The Exorcist lived up to its reputation and became my favorite horror flick; War of the Worlds, on the other hand, I found quite disappointing.The film had ambition with its level and scale of special effects; I cannot deny that. It undoubtedly broke ground for the sci-fi genre and paved the way for the likes of Star Trek and Star Wars, which I can greatly respect and appreciate. Though the effects don't hold up by today's standards, it's a pleasure to see the roots of visual effects as we know it . . . the down side is, this is also the root of pictures that spend more time delivering effects than story.Hard to believe considering War of the Worlds came from a famous novel by the same name, huh? Unfortunately, the creators of the film rightly assumed that the novel would require adaptation to fit the new medium, but wrongly assumed that era clichés would suffice. Enter a love story with no steam, a plot with mixed directions, and a bunch of annoying background clichés that are supposed to pass as characters. Some of these characters belonged on The Little Rascals, Three Stooges, Andy Griffith, and not in a sci-fi film about warring worlds. I enjoyed reading War of the Worlds, and how at first I felt the novel was underwhelming but grew to appreciate the downplayed approach Wells took. I vividly remember the ending of the novel years after reading it - the anxiety of mankind's apparent defeat at the hands of the martians, the eeriness of walking the streets of a destroyed city, and the mystery behind a toppled War machine - it stands out more clearly in my mind than most of the sci-fi epics shown in cinema. This 1953 filmed interpretation of War of the Worlds, I feel, does not do the novel justice. War of the Worlds did not need a spiritual and explosive last stand inside a church for its finale. The end result leaves the film with many superficial ideas in place, but the heart of the novel doesn't quite beat for this film. I would love to see a new cinematic rendition of War of the Worlds, one that fully and faithfully realizes the Wells vision on the silver screen. Look to the Spielberg helmed version for a movie that comes close to capturing the soul of what Wells intended. That one isn't quite there, but it's a hell of a lot closer than this.</fullReview>

Just give 'em a good, hearty blast of some of our vilest bacterium. That'll sure show 'em that they can't mess with the likes of us Earthlings (and our germs) and expect to get away with it! Even though War Of The Worlds contained some mighty striking visuals that were really quite impressive for their time (though now severely dated), I thought that this rather disappointing Alien Invasion/Thriller seriously lacked the essential spark and overall vitality that's clearly required in the better-made Sci-Fi flicks from the 1950s, such as Forbidden Planet, The Monolith Monsters and The Incredible Shrinking Man.With its story loosely based on the H.G. Wells' novel of the same name, I found this original screen adaptation of War Of The Worlds to be downright dull, sluggish and basically uninspired for the most part.And what put the biggest damper on the overall drama and terror of the story was the terrible, out-of-place romantic ordeal that unfortunately transpired between Dr. Clayton Forrester and Sylvia Van Buren. Yeah. These 2 were, without question, the dreariest pair of boobs ever thrown together in any Sci-Fi picture for the sake of some unnecessary romantic intrigue.Anyways - If I were to actually go ahead and compare the 2005 remake of War Of The Worlds (from director Steven Spielberg) to this original version, I'd confidently say that, apart from its greatly pumped-up visual effects, Spielberg didn't do any better when it came to improving on the entertainment value of the story or on making its principle characters more interesting and/or likable.</fullReview>

The thrills is really good and some of it is surprising. The special effects are great. The movie is filmed very good. The music is great. The film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end. This is a very good and thrilling film. If you like Gene Barry, Ann Robinson, Les Tremayne, Robert Cornthwaite, Sandro Giglio, the rest of the cast in the film, Sci-Fi, Action, Thrillers, and interesting films then I strongly recommend you to see this film today!Movie Nuttball's NOTE:If you like alien movies and/or the subject of aliens I also recommend the following films: The Thing from another World, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Horror, Express, The UFO Incident, Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, John Carpenter's The Thing, Krull, Time Walker, My Science Project, Howard the Duck, John, Carpenter's Starman, John Carpenter's They Live, Mac and Me, Explorers, Invaders from Mars, Alien Seed, Total Recall, The Abyss, Communion, Suburban Commando, Fire in the Sky, The Arrival, Mars Attacks!

		<shortDescription>Disappointing Adaptation of a Classic Novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The making of this film is essentially the trashing of one of the greatest sci-fi novels ever. Take the Martians. In Wells' novel, they are the Victorians from Hell, a dire warning of how humanity might turn out (and, 100 years later, are frighteningly close to realising). However, in this film, the Martians are nothing but the "Commies from Outer Space" that populated American 50s sci-fi flicks. Similarly, Wells' novel attacks the twin pillars Victorian society were founded on- organised religion and a blind faith in science and technology. Rather than following through with this theme, (which would've been perfectly applicable to 50s America) the entire film is constructed as a shallow homage to religion and science. Interestingly, the prime theme of the novel, an attack on colonialism, never gets a look-in in the film. Given that the story here is basically "America saves the world from the godless commies from outer space", it's certainly amusing that its never mentioned. :) Do yourself a favour- read the book instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why call the 50's the 50's?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this movie and thinking about it as much as possible, I've reached 2 conclusions. 1. After the square dance scene near the beginning, the film goes steadily down-hill in every which way. 2. The ending provides a message for the ages...while the rabble are looting and rioting,the serious Christians pray for a miracle, and get one...in the form of Martian destroying bacteria. It reminded me a little of the biblical Christian epics where Victor Mature and the faithful are going out into the Coliseum to be eaten by lions, or killed by gladiators. Not the results, but the mood and the aspect of religiousity. So to sum up...special effects don't make a movie. And Hollywood has/had no equal when it comes to taking good original material and turning it in to melodramatic, formulactic pap.</fullReview>

Also I really am not interested in watching footage of a square dance.The space ship scenes are terrific as is the introduction and narrative. But, like so many films they move away from the book in so many places that the atmosphere is lost.If only films did not have to have the "Love interest" and the "God angle" it is as though script writers have a real problem with telling a story just as it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tacky and Pretentious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is always interesting to go back to some old sci-fi movies of the 50s and see how they look in the 21st century. We always notice first of all the "bad" special effects, the fact that the technology of movie-making was so primitive back then. We also sometimes see signs of the times--either references to political events of the times or old-fashioned cultural references. We know enough to overlook these things and try to enjoy the movie on its own terms.Unfortunately, War of the Worlds is bad in any era. The main problem with the movie is that it seems to take itself too seriously starting out with a pretentious narration that seems to perceive itself as revealing the meaning of existence. When the aliens appear, looking like some menacing shop-vacs, we begin to think that maybe something is not quite right. And then there is a love story between a scientist and an annoying librarian, not to mention a whole bunch of long boring stretches, and you realize this thing is really pretty dated.Not all movies like this are bad. The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), for example, although it also has the same tacky special effects, has a human drama that is actually pretty effective. War of the Worlds seems to strike wrong notes a bunch of different times while adhering to the notion that it is revealing some great truth about the universe. And then there are the shop-vacs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cedric Hardwicke opens the proceedings with all the dramatic impact of someone reading the London Telephone Directory. It does not bode too well for what is to follow. Gene Barry does his best with a somewhat vague and disjointed script but does not appear to be involved in the proceedings to any great extent; and Ann Robinson screams very nicely. The special effects are, for its time, quite clever, although not a patch on 'Forbidden Planet', made just a few years later. The real trouble lies in the fact that there is no real story as such. At least the recent effort with Tom Cruise had a tale to tell - and obviously far more impactful effects - not just machines bashing up the earthlings! For a better example of cinematic sci-fi of the 1950s have a look at 'The Day The Earth Stood Still' or 'Forbidden Planet'. These two, and some others, are rightly 'classics'. This one is just fairly good fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WAR OF THE WORLDS is an old 1951 science fiction film loosely based on H.G. Wells' novel (although the alien isn't the same at all) and is probably the most action-packed sci-fi film of the 50s, although it sorta lacks in plot. Basically, aliens arrive in flying saucers and start shooting up the earth. People die from the evil alien invaders' wrath and Earth must think of a way to defeat them. (SPOILERS AHEAD!) The aliens end up dying from Earth's oxygen.Grade: 7/10MPAA Rating: GMy Rating: Ages 7 and up (intense sci-fi violence)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible, despite its reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a testament to anyone who says that remakes can't be better than the original. Spielberg's film had its problems, but it's nothing compared to the mess that is this one. It's so hopelessly a '50s film that, watching it today, one can't help but feel sorry for the moviegoers of that era - they had no idea what they were missing. I'm not the kind of guy that hates old films just because they're old, but I'm also not the type that loves them for the same reason. I loved The Day the Earth Stood Still despite its flaws, and I hated this. Well, maybe not hated. But definitely disliked it. The effects are groundbreaking, I'm sure, and there are some interesting themes and ideas that are brought up, but everything is wasted because of the terrible dialogue and even worse acting. There are some scenes and lines that are repeated in the remake, but they're interesting only for that reason in this film; much of this film is a throwaway. There are no interesting or even believable characters, there's no clear and concise plot to speak of, and there's a vicious right-wing slant on the whole thing. Fits right into the stereotype of terrible alien invasion flicks from the '50s, despite a better pedigree and reputation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strictly for kids. I speak from my own experience. I liked it as a kid, but watching it again was a disappointment; I didn't expect a masterpiece, but considering how nice the critics have been to it... Imbecilic dialog, bad acting, and a rather tiresome over-emphasis on religion make this one laughable. I really don't understand why the religious side is so strong here. I mean, where was this God when the Martians bombed most of Earth's cities? Also, I'd sooner believe that "Martians" were really planning an invasion than that people talk in real life like they do in this movie.Still, it could have been worse? It could have been remade decades later by Spielberg and with Tom Cruise in the lead role. Now, THAT would be an awful movie!

		<shortDescription>An earlier bore of the worlds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to watch this version of "The War of the Worlds" after being unimpressed by Steven Spielberg's recent remake. It follows the same basic storyline of Martians attacking the Earth, but is amazingly even more boring than the recent remake.This film does have two commendable points, the sharp narration of Cedric Hardwicke and the special effects, which are impressive for their time. Unfortunately special effects aren't a great benefit because the film has little story beyond the fact that aliens attack the Earth and no tension, which even the Spielberg remake had at points. The acting in this film is fine, but the characters are superficial and don't help make this film interesting. However, I did learn a valuable lesson from one of the lead characters: scientists tend to have handy Geiger counters ready in their car.The scene where the preacher walked into the field was decent, but for the most part this film is consistently boring. The religious overtones near the end of the film are laughably over-the-top as the people of America seek to survive the Martians by clustering in churches and praying. This film does have one key advantage over the more recent version: it is only 85 minutes, so it comes to its abrupt ending much sooner. However, this film resulted in George Pal having free reign to adapt other H.G. Wells novels to film. Luckily this led to the production of "The Time Machine" (1960), which is an infinitely more interesting adaptation than this film.</fullReview>

Not until the 1960s was it learned that Venus, like Mercury, was too hot to be habitable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly awful movie that both fails as an interpretation of the H.G. Wells classic and as a 50s sci-fi B movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite having the full title H. G. Wells The War of the Worlds this movie makes only fleeting references to the source material. Gone are the tripods replaced with UFOs. The main character transformed into a two dimensional hero and a weak love interest is tacked on to provide the screaming and hysteria. The key scene with the Thunder Child war ship to show mankind's best efforts thwarted is nowhere to be seen. Even the important secondary characters are lost like the parson (though there is a throwaway scene at the beginning of the movie with a priest) to show the hopelessness of religion in the face of war (more on that later). The artilleryman also makes no appearance and he is one of the most compelling characters in the novel. The only two scant references to the novel are the falling cylinder at the very beginning and the creeping snake like tentacle in the middle of the movie.Spoilers: I specifically have a problem with the end of the movie as it clashes philosophically with what Wells has to say about organized religion in the novel. In the novel the insane parson looses all reason at first thinking that God is punishing humanity for its sins and then later that he has abandoned them. His ravings eventually get noticed by the martians and result in his death while the secular writer of philosophy, the narrator of the tale, survives. The conclusion of the movie takes place in a church full of the praying faithful just as the martian spaceships fall to the ground. It's not stated of course but the implication (while the closing narration does explain that is was bacteria) is that their faith saved them, and possibly humanity. Wells was surely turning in his grave. This is my biggest problem with this movie, not just that it bears only the faintest of references to the source material but that it also flies in the face of the philosophy behind it. I strongly suspect the script writers had not even read the original novel and only used the title to sucker patrons to come to see it. Had it not been titled after Wells' novel this so called cult classic would quite deservedly have long since been forgotten.But putting Well's novel aside, how doe sit work as a sci-fi movie. Pretty awful too unfortunately. Were it not pretending to be The War of the Worlds I might give it a couple of more stars but not many. All the B movie elements are there, bad acting, corny dialogue, rubber monsters, unrealistic plot and terrifying special effects - terrifyingly bad that is. Especially when you see what movies preceded it, like The Day the Earth Stood Still, can do with a low budget and primitive special effects. The space ships that replaced the tripods in the movie were suspended by multiple wires - and I mean multiple, there is about 20 or so from each space ship - which can be seen clearly in every single scene. There are so many of them you just can't miss them. The film makers use lots of smoke to try to disguise them but it backfires as the wires are black and most of the smoke is white which only serves to highlight them. The rubber monster martian in the movie put his hand on the female lead's shoulder but when she screams it runs off like a startled rabbit with its arms flailing. The monster running off reminded me of Grover from the Muppets which made me laugh out loud. Perhaps it was frightened by her awful performance. I really can't think of one saving grace for this movie other than to watch it for laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>H.G. Wells' novel "The War of the Worlds" was, when you think about it, a metaphor for colonialism: the Martians with their superior technology run roughshod over the Earthlings. Well, when they decided to make this movie, the Cold War was going on, and so they couldn't talk about colonialism openly. So, instead, they just had a bunch of humans fighting the Martians with nukes. And of course, there's the usual sorts of things that you can expect in a '50s movie: the army is glorious, and women cry a lot.What we nowadays notice about this movie is that the main character has the same name as the mad scientist on "MST3K" who forces Mike, Servo and Crow, to watch the worst movies ever made.

The original novel was written in 1898, yes, the 19th century, and set in ENGLAND. ENGLAND, d'you hear? There were no planes, or nukes, and they completely obliterated my favourite chapter, THE THUNDERCHILD, where a 19th century torpedo-ram warship destroys two of the martians. That's another point. The martians had legs!! This is important: H.G.Wells notes that the wheel that is pivotal in human technology is replaced by the leg, nature's own preferred choice. I still hate them for setting it in America!! I hate it!!! And the novel was written from a first person perspective. Surely that must mean something? There was no woman! What happened to the curate??? How dare they involve a plane? And also, I might note, that in the novel, the TRUE war of the worlds, the aliens couldn't fly. They were only just learning to at the end. And what happened to the red weed??? Philistines! I hate it, I hate it!!!!!! I wouldn't hate this film so much if they had called it something different, it really doesn't deserve the name war of the worlds. Set it in America? Why America, of all places, why???

		<shortDescription>The vast majority of the budget went on the effects - and it shows (sadly, no longer in a good way)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a flaming meteorite hits the earth in the mountains behind a small town in California, it becomes a focal point for the locals (thinking of future tourism) and the scientific community. However after a short time the meteorite reveals it's secrets - it is not a random piece of rock but a hollow vessel containing alien vessels. As the vessels spread across America and more meteorites hit the earth, whole cities are destroyed and the world's powers are forced to fight back before it is too late - but what can defeat these seemingly indestructible craft?The vast majority of the budget of this production was spent on the special effects - and it shows. Although the amount of money involved wouldn't even get Tom Cruise out of bed, it was a lot at the time - even if it looks laughably basic now. That's the problem with basing your film so squarely on special effects - chances are it will date badly - heck, even Terminator 2's morphing effects have the look of special effects done on a computer geek's PC in comparison to some of the stuff we've seen recently. That is the problem with this film; the effects were all and now they look very basic. The craft are imaginative and well designed (as are the actual aliens from the odd glimpse we get) but the strings are clear to see at times and the models are just that - models. The actual plot is very basic and the lack of realistic effects takes away from the threat and the tension I knew I should have felt.With so much money spent on effects, it is no surprise that the source material is turned into an effects fest rather than a gripping story but it is also a shame that the bits of story that we are given are not very good. I know that audiences of the time had come to expect a romantic subplot in any film they watched, but that doesn't mean it works - it doesn't. The forced male/female dynamic is a bit false and only serves to slow the sci-fi thrust down a bit - likewise the overdone repetition of scenes of Christianity and religion. The acting also suffers from the dominance of the effects - the main characters are pretty wooden, with poor dialogue poorly delivered. Minor roles of group stereotypes (eg generals) are quite good but they are very basically drawn.Overall this is a reasonably enjoyable piece of sci-fi from the 1950's but it is lacking in tension and the sense of a real threat - even with craft closing in on major cities and countries falling, I never felt tense or on the edge of my seat. The reliance on effects means that other aspects suffer - acting, plot, script and characters are all a distant second behind the effects. It's worth seeing but it is all very tame by today's standards - I'm not really a remake kinda guy but if one story requires a cinematic update it's this one.</fullReview>

What, and this still holds true for Steven Speilburgs insulting offering, the movie makers have failed to understand in adapting this novel to a movie, is the basic premise OF the novel. Its a juxtaposition, a critique, of the perceived the technological superiority of the British, by the British, towards the end of the 19th century, when the reality was that the British were out gunned in all forms by the rise of the Americans and the Germans (which led in part to WW1). Its an observation of Religious doctrine with true belief. The destruction of hope and the rise of desperation. HG Wells wrote this as a wake-up call to the Victorian society that continued to fail to understand how the world was changing...War of the Worlds, get it? This movie lacks intelligence, no subtlety and nothing of the fear that made the book great. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone other than a student trying to understand how American movie makers cannot adapt British novels. I despair at the new offering by Speilsburg who seems to have adapted the 1950's movie rather than the novel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see that this is one of the films that Tim Burton was inspired by to create Mars Attacks! In some ways, this is almost better than the Tom Cruise/Steven Spielberg remake, well, unless you count the remake's groundbreaking effects. Based on the novel by H.G. Wells, this tells the story of an alien race who are looking for a new planet to live on, and planet Earth is the only one with all useful elements. When residents of a small town witness a "meteorite" crash to the ground and they are excited. But this changes when they discover it the mother ship of all the terrible Martian creatures and machines that plan to takeover the planet. The rest of the film is the war of Earth against these evil extra-terrestrial beings, as well as the characters hiding and defending themselves from them. Starring Gene Barry as Dr. Clayton Forrester, Ann Robinson as Sylvia Van Buren, Les Tremayne as Maj. Gen. Mann, Robert Cornthwaite as Dr. Pryor, Sandro Giglio as Dr. Bilderbeck and Lewis Martin as Pastor Dr. Matthew Collins. It won the Oscar for Oscar for Best Special Effects, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing and Best Sound. Martians were number 27 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains and the film was number 44 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a HUGE fan of 50s sci-fi. I love these movies and think most of them are highly underrated, as too many people are put off by less than perfect special effects. However, I am pretty forgiving in this area, as you simply can't compare 50s effects with modern ones--you need to put them in context for what was available for that time. And, in this regard I gotta admit this is one of the better ones as far as effects go.On the other hand, another important thing I consider for sci-fi is entertainment and lasting value of the film. Well, in this regard, this movie falls pretty flat. While the first half of the film is well done and reasonably interesting, the final conclusion is completely LAME--just as the Earth is about to be destroyed, the aliens catch a cold and die! Talk about a silly and anti-climatic ending!!! This made me feel pretty stupid for having wasted my time with the film.I really think the high scores might be influenced by the social importance of this H. G. Wells story--you know, how Orson Welles created a lot of havoc with his radio adaptation of WAR OF THE WORLDS. But, if you ignore this and rate the movie purely on aesthetics and entertainment, a 5 seems like a reasonable score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning - this contains one big spoiler about the end of the movieAlright, im 17 years old, and i grew up listening to Jeff waynes musical version of the war of the worlds in the car. I loved every minute of it, The mood it set, the way it was described, it used to give me nightmares. The whole sociological prospects that Wells puts across are not lost in the musical, as neither is the total climate of defeat and chaos. Then i read the book, and God it got better. The atmosphere of occupation, the feelings of the characters, the shear terror of the Martains that were undefeatable and drunk the blood of the human prey. And then I saw the film. It was horrible. The only thing that the film has in common to the book was its title and the fact the martains get killed by bacteria in the end. Its set in the wrong time period, a post ww2 environment instead of a victorian one. The whole idea of setting it in the 18th century is that the thought of anything coming from another planet was unheard off. Its set in America, rather than Britain. It loses all of the points that H.G wells was trying to put across. The fighting machines are not remotely the same, the martains look more like E.T than what they're surposed too. Please, this film does not deserve the praise given to it, anyone who has read the book will know that.</fullReview>
