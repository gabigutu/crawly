		<shortDescription>The Land Beyond the Law (1927) - Lost ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is my ambition to add as many silent film synopsis of films that have a survival status of unknown or presumed lost. I try to do as much research as I can and it is not my intention to deceive anyone, for sometimes the film does exist. I am more than delighted if someone has knowledge of a film listed as lost but survives, as I wish all silent films did survive. I hope the reader enjoys this brief synopsis.Jerry Steele ( Ken Maynard ) is appointed special deputy by the governor to bring law and order to a troublesome region, infested by roustabouts in the employ of Bob Crew ( Tom Santschi ), whose respectability is a cloak for his rustling and killing. Steele comes to the aid of Ginger O'Hara ( Dorothy Dwan ), a young girl entrusted to Crew, when her guardian takes advantage of her; and the couple soon become romantically attached. "Hanzup" Harry ( Noah Young ), known as a bandit, is made one of his deputies, and following a series of encounters with the rustlers, the territory becomes a haven of security for pioneers from the East and Midwest.This 1927 silent western was produced by Charles R. Rogers Productions and starred Ken Maynard. The survival status of The Land Beyond the Law is listed in the American Silent Feature Film Database as; No holdings located in archives.</fullReview>
