		<shortDescription>Hard cheese! A jolly good show!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This fabulous film is available on DVD at last, twinned with another Alaister Sim classic, THE GREEN MAN. But, the star of this film is the dapper TERRY-THOMAS. Every scene he is in is superb. From the suave cad in the first half of the film to the flustered toff in the second, this is one of his finest performances and stands up to repeat viewings due to his expressive faces and masterful comic timing.I hear there is going to be a Hollywood remake of this film, which will be a huge mistake as there has been no one like T-T since. I recommend anyone who is a fan of British comedy to see this classic or you will forever be crying 'hard cheese'!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the ultimate Terry Thomas film. He gets to act out being the most wonderful cad, stealing girls off poor saps arms, driving open top sports cars are a furious pace, and generally getting the chance to utter 'hard cheese old boy'. Carmicheal is excellent, bewildered to begin with and slowly learning the dark arts of Upmanship. I implore all to see this film, as always the golden rule is - if a film as Alistair Sim in it, its got to be worth a look. Currently avialable on a 2 film DVD release, with another UK B&amp;W comedy classic. Buy and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautifully funny, nostalgic and fabulously-acted comedy of English moeurs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot remember how many times I have watched this film now - it takes me back to a time of charming English etiquette which, being too young, I never witnessed. The range of social situations through which we are taken in the apprenticeship of 'Lifemanship' are hilarious, and in a gentle and exquisitely-understated way. Ian Carmichael is, of course excellent, but my all-time hero, Terry-Thomas, is on the toppest of forms delivering the "Look's like a Polish stomach pump" and "Oh I say, smashing cricket stroke" lines with his unshakeable aplomb. A nostalgic treasure of a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a neglected gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't hesitate: this jolly little movie is pretty much impeccable.An excellent script, which never falters. And a BOFFO cast of British actors. The quintessential role for Terry-Thomas (tho' "Magnificent Men" is a close second).But also fine turns from Alistair Sim, John Le Mesurier, Hugh Paddick, Peter Jones. Hattie Jacques does an hilarious voice-parody of Joan Greenwood. Janette Scott is VERY good in a thankless "skirt" role; what a charming personality.Old car fans will love this. The sport-cars and the mocked-up vintage "Swiftmobile" are worth the price of admission alone. (Sadly, the production designer / props chaps are as yet uncredited at IMDb: perhaps the information is lost.) Very nice camera-setups. Amusingly cheesy sets. A really excellent score from John Addison that is up to Georges Auric's standard.This has a very jolly, intimate ambiance: a sense of small scale. Feels rather like the b&amp;w Tati movies.Ahem. Unlike many British comedies, I can really see the attraction of remaking this: the material is so damned good that it could use another go-round, without necessarily insulting the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How To Win Without Actually Cheating !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humilliated in sport,losing his girl to a cad, and always taken advantage of-Henry Palfrey decides enough is enough and enrols himself at the College Of Lifemanship to learn self improvement strategies.School For Scoundrels is inspired by a trio of parody self-help books written by Stephen Potter called Gamesmanship, Lifemanship &amp; Oneupmanship, with the subsequent result being a deftly charming satire backed up with very knowing comedy. Taking the lead role of Henry Palfrey is Ian Carmichael, tho a star of many funny and successful British comedies, Carmichael is not someone I would normally term as a confident leading man, but here he does well and I think that is probably down to having the ebullient Terry-Thomas to feed off. Terry-Thomas is here in full caddish rapscallion mode as Henry's love rival Raymond Delauney, a devilishly funny character who firmly has us begging Henry to get the better of him come the end. Some delightful laughs to be had here, from the duos tennis matches, to Henry's turning of the tables on an unscrupulous car salesmen. School For Scoundrels is never ever less than a funny movie.However the film is far from perfect, Alistair Sim isn't given that much to do as Henry's mentor, Professor Stephen Potter, and this ultimately feels like a wasted opportunity. The direction is also pretty patchy, which when I delved further is sadly understandable. Robert Hamer was the perfect choice to direct because nestling on his CV is the majestic Kind Hearts And Coronets. But Hamer was fired shortly after filming began after lapsing back into alcoholism {he would die three years later}, so the film was completed by Hal Chester and Cyril Frankel.Frayed edges aside tho, School For Soudrels still holds up well today, and when one witnesses the poor standard of the 2006 remake, this 1960 offering is something of a comedic gem to be cherished forever and always.Hard cheese old boy 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The English Sense of Humour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen Potter's biography tells that, before this happy film version was made, Cary Grant was keen, with American producer Carl Foreman, to make a film about Potter's brilliant (now sadly out-of-print)Oneupmanship books. The problem that confronted Grand and Foreman was that they couldn't find anyway to make the humour "American". In the end they dropped it and this rather Ealing-esque film was made instead. This film is just great fun and a reminder of what British cinema at its best can offer. Thank goodness Grant and Foreman didn't give it the "American" treatment. Thank heavens also for a sterling case, in which Terry-Thomas particularly stands out. Tennis, anyone?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic bit of wicked humour!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Henry Palfrey meets the lovely young April Smith he thinks he has things good. However a meeting with them and Raymond Delauney sees Palfrey made to look a fool by the caddish Delauney. To counter his wishy washy ways, Palfrey joins the `Lifemanship' school of Mr Potter. Here he learns all the ploys of a cad. Upon completion of the course he sets his sight on Delauney ? but can he avoid becoming that which he hates?Terry Thomas is famous for his lecherous wretch and here he not only plays it to perfection, but also gets out played at his own game. The plot here is in three acts. Firstly the caddish Delauney outplays Palfrey. Second act Palfrey attends the school and finally Palfrey returns to his life a changed man. All three acts play out very well for different reasons, only the end of act 3 drags a little bit but ends well. The gentle comedy of the time runs through it ? it is a very English film in its own way. I enjoyed the vast majority of it.Ian Carmichael appears a weak choice for the lead but his transformation from coward to cad is well played and he was actually very good. Thomas is well cast although this is what he is famous for I suppose. Sim is pretty good but given too little to do and there are some nice little cameos from Hattie Jacques and (even better) John Le Mesurier.Overall this is very slight but it is also very enjoyable. It isn't hilarious but it is a very enjoyable film with a good sense of wicked humour running through the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ian Carmichael at his most innocent; Terry-Thomas as his most unctuous; Alastair Sim at his most Simish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Oh, hard cheese, old man!" School for Scoundrels, that cheery, malicious comedy of one-upmanship, was based on Stephen Potter's classic of underhanded winning, Gamesmanship - Or How To Win Without Really Cheating, and its follow-up, Lifemanship. (Potter wrote several others, too.) What is lifemanship? "Well, gentlemen," says the avuncular head of school played by Alastair Sim to a new class, "lifemanship is the science of being one up on your opponents at all times. It's the art of making him feel that somewhere, some how, he's become less that you. He who is not one up, is one down." Getting ready to sign up for the courses is Henry Palfrey (Ian Carmichael), so nice, so pleasant, so helpful that he usually finds himself either ignored, taken advantage of or walked all over. His employees pay him little attention. He meets April Smith (Janette Scott), an attractive young woman, and invites her to dinner, only to see himself turned into the extra man while that bounder, Raymond Delauney (Terry-Thomas) moves in and takes over. He decides to buy a car to impress April and winds up with a moveable piece of smoking, chugging, wheezing metal courtesy of two smarmy used car salesmen, Dunstan (Dennis Price) and Dudley (Peter Jones) Dorchester. And when he agrees to play tennis at the club with Raymond while April watches them...oh, my. Raymond reduces Henry to an impotent lamb in front of April. "Hard cheese," says Raymond sympathetically, every time he maneuvers Henry into looking foolish and losing a point. The worm strikes back, however, when Henry signs up for courses at Mr. Potter's College of Lifemanship. There Henry learns all the little gambits that will put him one up...the cough just as his opponent begins to strike the ball at snooker, hearing a joke about a cripple then standing and limping out of the room, the spilled drink on the dress that leads to a bit of solicitous dress drying after the girl takes it off, the apparently well-meaning delays that drive a competitor to distraction, and on. With Professor S. Potter's help, Henry becomes a one-upsman to be proud of. He learns to make his employees nervous, how to deal with used car salesmen, ways to innocently seduce young women, and how to deal with Raymond Delauney. The person who has to grind his teeth and hear "Oh, hard cheese" is now Delauney. It's almost as satisfying as eating a double portion of sticky toffee pudding. Henry's final tennis match with that cad Delauney is the funniest, most satisfying game of tennis I've seen since Billie Jean King slowly dismembered Bobby Riggs. Is there a lesson for us in all this? Yes, but fortunately it's saved for the very last. And that lesson Henry learns while gazing lovingly at April and telling her he loves her. "We're witnessing the birth of a new gambit," Professor Potter says proudly. No, we're witnessing the moment when love, and the person we love, requires sincerity. All the one-upman gambits are so outrageous and so familiar, and served up with such good-natured manipulation, that all we can do is sit back and smile. School for Scandal is a witty, almost innocent and sweet-natured movie with a fine, dry script, credited to Patricia Moyes and the producer, Hal Chester. In fact it was written by Peter Ustinov and the blacklisted American writer, Frank Tarloff. Robert Hamer, the director of Kind Hearts and Coronets, is credited with directing. When Hamer, an alcoholic, fell off the wagon half way through, however, the producer immediately fired him, brought in another director, Cyril Frank, and the two of them finished the movie unbilled. In addition to the script, of course, what makes this movie so funny and memorable are the performances. Terry-Thomas was never better as the unctuous cad who finally gets his. Ian Carmichael plays another innocent with great ineffectual likability, and then comes through for us. And Alastair Sim as Professor S. Potter is a joy. Watching Professor Potter introduce Henry Palfrey to one-upmanship during their first meeting is to watch one of the cleverest examples of Sim's timing and expression you'd ever hope to see. The only sad spot is seeing Dennis Price in a decidedly secondary role and not looking all that healthy. For many of us, this is a movie to watch while taking notes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hard cheese!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late Robert Hamer never managed to top his Ealing masterpiece 'Kind Hearts &amp; Coronets', but came tantalisingly close in 1960 with this witty comedy inspired by Stephen Potter's 'Oneupmanship' books. They were unfilmable as they stood, so top marks to Hal E.Chester and Patricia Moyes for coming up with a workable script. What is oneupmanship? Nothing less than the art of winning without actually cheating, getting one up on your opponent at all times. Who is your opponent? Practically everybody! 'School' centres on everyman 'Henry Palfrey' ( the splendid Ian Carmichael ), who is by his own admission one of life's failures. Waiters ( John Le Mesurier ) insult him, his own staff - particularly 'Gloatbridge' ( Edward Chapman ) - bully him, an old chum - 'Ray Delauney' ( Terry-Thomas ) humiliates him in a tennis club - and when he tries to impress lovely 'April Smith' ( Janette Scott ) by buying a Swiftmobile ( it closely resembles a reupholstered roller skate! ), a pair of unscrupulous car salesmen known for some reason as 'The Winsome Welshmen' ( Peter Jones and Dennis Price ) rip him off. Desperate, Henry enrols at The School Of Lifemanship in Yeovil to learn how to become a success. It is run by 'Mr.S.Potter' ( Alistair Sim )...Some British comedy films look and feel timeless, and this is one of them. I must have seen it over a hundred times, and it never fails to make me laugh. What a cast! Plus cameos from Hattie Jacques, Hugh Paddick, Gerald Campion, and Jeremy Lloyd. The scene where Henry gets his own back on the shady car dealers is marvellously satisfying. Ditto him getting his revenge on Delauney. As Henry, Ian Carmichael is, as ever, sublime. His naivety gradually giving way to cunning. Terry-Thomas appears in his finest movie role, as the caddish Ray, whose catchphrase is 'hard cheese!'. His mounting stress as Henry turns the tables is hysterical! I can't think of a bad word to say about this film. The final gag at the end - Ray is seen getting off a train to enrol at the School - is the cherry on the cake! In 1976, the B.B.C. brought 'Oneupmanship' to television, starring Richard Briers and Peter Jones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One-Up on the Other Fellow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The English humorist Stephen Potter enjoyed great success in the 1950s with his books "Gamesmanship", which ironically advised sportsmen on "how to win without actually cheating", chiefly by using psychological ploys to unsettle their opponents, and "Lifemanship" and "One-upmanship" which advocated a similar attitude to life in general.It is perhaps surprising that the makers of this film did not use the titles of any of Potter's books for their own title, as at least two of them have passed into the English language. (My Shorter Oxford English Dictionary does contain an entry for "lifemanship", but it is not a word in common use today). The title they actually did use is an obvious reference to Richard Brinsley Sheridan's 18th Century comedy, "The School for Scandal". The central idea is that Potter, not content with merely writing books, has actually opened a College of Lifemanship in Somerset in order to teach his philosophy.The central character of the film is Henry Palfrey, a young man who enrols at the College (a sort of boarding school for adults). Henry is, like many characters played by Ian Carmichael, upper-middle-class and likable but not too bright. (Carmichael was later to become a famous Bertie Wooster on British television). He is ostensibly managing director of his family company, but in reality his job is a mere sinecure, and the firm is actually run by the office manager Gloatbridge, who treats him with patronising condescension. Henry is also patronised by his urbane but caddish acquaintance Raymond Delauney, who thrashes him at tennis and threatens to win over the affections of his pretty girlfriend April. When Henry tries to buy a car to impress April (Delauney drives an expensive Italian sports car), he is cheated by a rascally pair of used-car salesmen who sell him a broken-down wreck for 695 guineas (?729.75- a large amount of money in 1960).Henry therefore enrols in Potter's school where he learns the philosophy and all the tricks of "Lifemanship". The secret, according to Potter, is to be "one-up" on everyone else at all times. ("Just remember, if you're not one-up on the other fellow, then he's one up-on you".) Having completed the course, Henry emerges as brash and self-confident, putting Gloatbridge in his place, persuading the car dealers to buy back the car for more than he originally paid, and avenging himself on Delauney, not only by beating him at tennis but also by making him look a complete idiot in the process. The only questions left to be determined are "Can Henry win the lovely April?" and, more importantly, "Can he do so without becoming as awful and insincere as his rival Delauney?" This story is told in a very loose, episodic manner as a series of jokes and comedy sketches. (The Pythons were later to use a similar technique in some of their films such as "Life of Brian"). Carmichael receives excellent support from a number of other famous British comedy stars, some of them such as John Le Mesurier or Hattie Jacques only playing minor roles. The best supporting performances come from Peter Jones and Dennis Price as the car dealers, Alastair Sim as Potter and Terry-Thomas as Delauney. Like Carmichael, Terry-Thomas tended to specialise in one sort of part, in his case the smooth but lecherous cad. (Interestingly, he was the first choice for the role of Wooster which eventually went to Carmichael. Price played Jeeves in that series).This was, ostensibly, the last film made by Robert Hamer before his tragically early death three years later. I say "ostensibly" because there are reports that Hamer's alcoholism often prevented him from working and many scenes were in fact shot by another director. Hamer was, of course, the director of "Kind Hearts and Coronets", one of the greatest of the famous Ealing comedies. Although "School for Scoundrels" was released in the first year of the new decade, it has the feel of a fifties comedy rather than a sixties one, looking back to the age of Ealing rather than forward to the era of the "Carry Ons"- it is, for example, shot in black-and-white, and the humour lacks the bawdiness which characterises many British comedies from the sixties.The Ealing comedies were, generally, less episodic in format and had a more well-structured plot. Nevertheless, "School for Scoundrels" keeps something of their satirical humour; behind the laughter may have been a concern that the "never-had-it-so-good" Britain of the period was becoming increasingly materialistic and competitive, dominated by the "one-up on the other fellow" ethos of Delauney's real-life counterparts. Although I had never heard of the film until a DVD was recently given away free as part of a newspaper promotion, this must rate as one of the most amusing British comedies of the period. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is classic British comedy at its finest. Having watched it dozens of times over the years it was only the other day when I noticed the following gaff: Early in the film when Palfrey has been stitched up by Delauney at the restaurant he is outside with April when Delauney toots his wolf whistle horn on his 'new Belini 2.6' sports car. He stops and offers one of them a lift making the point that he can 'only give one of you a lift as its a two-seater'.Later in the film when Palfrey fresh from the college of lifemanship is winding Delauney up by keeping him waiting outside his flat to take him to a return tennis match when Palfrey does get in Delauney's two seater Delauney clearly annoyed with Palfrey sternly remarks 'come on we are picking April up on the way' and after much ado on the roads when they get to April's, tired of waiting she has made her own way. Good job really as three in a two seater doesn't work.Overall this is wonderful movie with great performances from all and as for the odd blunder well its hard cheese really!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give 'School for Scoundrels' a 9 out of 10 as punishment for the ending, where good triumphs over lifemanship. Terry-Thomas and Ian Carnmichael are always enjoyable, and of course this is the Golden Age of British (cinema) Comedy; but this is really Alastair Sim's movie, in my view. If you've ever seen a St Trinian's film, or 'A Christmas Carol,' you'll know what I mean. The initial interview between Mr Potter and Henry Palfrey is a small masterpiece, especially where Mr Potter (Sim) asks the oblivious Henry if he wouldn't agree that 'this round goes to me.' AS's (deliberately?) uneven voice, malevolent eyes and feline movements cannot be duplicated. I first saw this movie at the age of nine or ten when it was released, and remember enjoying Terry- Thomas most of all. Watching it again after a half-century I am struck by how astonishingly pretty Janette Scott is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic, (and very, very funny) British comedy that seems to have slipped through the net, (despite having been picked up and remade last year with Billy Bob Thornton). Aficianados, of course, love the film with a passion and for good reason since it represents a high point in the careers of Ian Carmichael, Terry-Thomas and director Robert Hamer, (sadly this was the last thing Hamer did).It's based on the Oneupmanship books of Stephen Potter, in themselves classics of British humour, and here Potter is played by the great and inimitable Alastair Sim, though Sim takes a back seat in this one. Surprisingly, the writers Hal E Chester and Paricia Moyes, who adapted Potter's books, have managed to pull together something of a coherent plot rather than just a series of sketches as initially nerdy Carmichael starts putting Sim's Dark Arts into practice as he goes head-to-head with the dastardly Thomas for the virtue of Janette Scott. Anyone who has ever wondered what the point of Terry-Thomas was need look no further than here. He's a comic fireball and he ignites every scene he's in. Seek this one out.</fullReview>

Even the minor roles are handled with care and commitment.

Even the location of the tennis club is now known to me, thanks to submissions on this website,and would still seem to be the same as they were then. Not only that but are only a few miles from where I presently live.

		<fullReview>Oh, if only we could still make films like this - lightweight, clever and so British - or dare I say *English*. Three of the Fifties best comedy actors here play roles that could have been written with them in mind; the polite and put-upon 'loser' is played marvellously by Ian Carmichael, who specialised in this kind of role; the free-wheeling braggart and womaniser is played to the hilt by the wonderful Terry-Thomas, and the slightly seedy head of the College of Oneupmanship is played with knowing wisdom by Alastair Sim. Even the two minor parts of 'The Winsome Welshmen' - the delightfully dodgy car salesmen who sell our hero the mother-of-all bangers are played with verve by Dennis Price and Peter Jones - "Oh, that's the er.. interpolated accounting system, Sir.." In common with most of the British comedies of the time, this is a film that can be viewed over and over, the familiarity bringing with it an affection that enhances its appeal. For my money, only the ending lets it down - it's as though no satisfactory conclusion could be written, so the screenwriter turned to the device of allowing one of the characters to address the audience directly. Still a ten out of ten though!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favourite Alastair Sim pictures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it is usually sent to the second division of Alastair Sim films (behind such classics as "The Green Man", "Scrooge", and "Green for Danger") this is one of my favourites.Although the credits say the film is based on 'novels' by Stephen Potter, they are really spoof 'self-help' manuals on how to get ahead in life. For example, if you are at a party where someone is talking to an admiring group about a country you have never visited (and don't even know) listen quietly until they give an opinion such as: "Left-wing politics are on the rise in Turkmenistan" and say "Yes, but not in the South." This is the 'Canterbury Block', which gives everyone the impression you are more of an expert than the speaker.In this film Ian Carmichael attends Potter's College of Lifemanship to learn how to overcome those who belittle and take advantage of him (and to win the girl of his dreams). His principal rival is Terry-Thomas with his snazzy Italian sports-car and constant refrain of "Hard cheese!" at tennis (you will want to knock his head off!). Sim acts first as Carmichael's tutor, then assists him in his 'oneupmanship' ploys. There is a great support cast, too: Dennis Price and Peter Jones as shady car dealers, Hugh Paddick and Hattie Jacques as college tutors, and Edward Chapman as the office manager from hell.Another reason for my affection for this film is that I saw it as a boy with my dad and we both laughed our heads off (especially at Sim's closing speech). We didn't have a close relationship and these moments were few and far between, but I always remember this when I watch "School for Scoundrels".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satire with sneakers rather than Monty Python's Doc Martens......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you think David Frost or John Cleese "invented" English satire then I implore you to watch "School for Scoundrels",a cornucopia of gentle and wistful irony at the expense of the arrogant,patronising public school / Oxbridge types that messrs Frost and Cleese usually avoided parodying as they themselves were drawn from their ranks. Mr Ian Carmichael(born to play the meek middle-class doormat)is thwarted in his every move by by the manic Mr Terry-Thomas.In despair he enrolls at Stephen Potter's Colllege of One-Upmanship where shrinking violets are turned into tigers,unravelling the subtle coils of the English Class - System by using the Nobs techniques against them. Mr Carmichael uses the subterfuge he is taught to play those who see themselves as his social superiors at their own game.Unlike Basil Fawlty who merely crawls round those who he sees as his social superiors and whose aspirations are to join that class.Those aspirations are what Cleese satirises,Fawlty's wish to "better"himself is what Cleese despises,quite the opposite to Potter who applauds Carmichael's wish to "better" himself and indeed enables it. Later British satire treated its victims with contempt,subjecting them to heavy-handed humiliation,"School for Scoundrels" merely makes them figures of fun,much more subtle and consequently more effective. Each of Carmichael's tormentors is hoisted with his own petard in a most satisfying manner. Miss J.Scott is innocent and sexy in a 1960 - ish way,Mr Price and Mr Jones incomparable.Mr Sim,first in a field of one,hooded eye and sardonic voice,is perfect as Stephen Potter.But I leave the best to last.Mr Terry-Thomas,leering,loathsome yet strangely child - like, irritatingly good at everything he does,a portrait to join those masterpieces from "Private's Progress" and "I'm All Right,Jack" of the cynical upper-class opportunist who gets his come-uppance. Before satire was written by Oxbridge public school boys for Oxbridge public school boys,British comedy writers believed their audience intelligent enough to appreciate gentle irony without stamping on their heads.It was,and it did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Henry Palfrey is one of life's bridesmaids. Nothing ever is in his control. His work is a case in point. He is the boss of an unidentified London family firm but his long-serving deputy makes all the decisions for him. He meets the beautiful April Smith (well, actually he knocks her over running for a bus) and takes her for dinner. But even that doesn't run smoothly as his deputy has wrinkled his nose at his choice of eatery and has, presumably, deliberately got his name wrong for the reservation. Ultimately, his great rival Raymond Delauney, who is a suave and sophisticated lounge lizard takes control of the situation and woos April successfully. Even buying a car results in being ripped-off for some awful old banger. However, upon successfully attending a residential course in the West Country about how to get your revenge, Palfrey turns the tables on everyone and wins the heart of April.One of my favourite films. It is a joy to watch, it is well crafted and hearkens back to a less congested, more innocent way of life. Perfect Saturday afternoon on the sofa material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well by now you will have already been won over by Terry Thomas and the crop of great British comedy actors (Alistair Sim, Dennis Price, Peter Jones and Ian Carmichael).This comment is posted to reinforce your belief that this is one of the best comedies ever made? I hope so! This film is a must see. Once seen never forgotten is what I say pip pip!If you haven't seen this film before well "bad luck!" ,as Delauney and Palfrey might tell you! (you need to see the film to understand this point!)The movie is based on a book which discussed the art of "one-upman-ship". A comedy played out by Alastair Sym,helping Ian Carmichael win against the odds to find true love and end up a future winner in life.The "comeuppance" of the shady car dealers is really memorable and a chuckle. How Palfrey finally outwits life's chance-rs is, well practically priceless! Terry Thomas losing his "Mr Cool" image whilst driving to Carmichael's directions (surely a voice for a Sat nav?!) is a lesson in comedy displayed by two fine actors at the peak of their careers.Not for the cad or dim witted,this film!When feeling a little cross at the winter rain I watch this and add a little fuel to the glowing fire and open a single malt. Try it!! Oh and don't forget one of petrol two of meths!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just out of curiosity, I clicked-up the 'Hated It' section; it came up 'no matches'. Well - after all, who could hate it? Ian Carmicheal plays the underdog, Palfrey, with no confidence in himself yet a steadfast belief in following the rules. He is the sort of bloke who gave Britain its reputation for being 'decent' whilst simultaneously contributing to its downfall in a world where decency has no place.His circumstances are brought into provocative contrast by Terry Thomas's caddish Delauney who will do almost anything to win out. But when a lady is in the game; Palfrey has cause to rethink. He signs-up for a course in 'Lifemanship' at a Yeovil college, and soon begins to turn the tables.This is the kind of quietly subtle comedy at which Britain used to excel during the 1950's &amp; 60's. There's not a wasted second, word, or expression. Terry Thomas plays the cad-extraordinaire; he was surely born to the role and featured in it frequently. His lingering and impoverished death was all the more tragic.This movie is a great comic watch, but also has a great deal to teach. Notably, it's a warning; don't be too good in a world that doesn't value goodness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of fun...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen the American "School for Scoundrels" and assume it's a remake of this wonderful British film. However, if it IS, then there is no reason for the remake, as I was thoroughly captivated by this little film. Of course, in recent years Hollywood has tried remaking some of the classic British comedies of the 1950s and failed miserably. Big casts and expensive gimmicks can't improve on a wonderful Brit-com from this era.The film starts with poor Ian Carmichael. He's a very mousy "nice" sort of person--and a bit of a loser. He seems to always be taken advantage of and is a sad case. When fast-talking Terry-Thomas takes Ian's girlfriend away as well as his self-respect, Ian is desperate to change his life. On a whim, he decides to attend a school that promises to help him learn to stand up for himself and get the most out of life. However, the school (owned by Alistair Sim) really teaches people to manipulate others and use trickery to get what you want. Ian turns out to be a model pupil and is soon using insincerity with the skill of a politician.Soon, Ian tries out his new skills on a used car lot (this is hilarious) as well as to get his girl back--and to give Terry-Thomas his comeuppance. It's all very funny but not in a very obvious way--with a subtle and cute manner that you can't help but like. On top of that, the actors and writers are at their best and the film ends on a funny note. Well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(64%) A superbly watchable classic British comedy that may dabble in silliness from time to time, but there's very few films from this era that are more fun. The cast is filled with some of the better performers of the time with the always very good Alastair Sim as the essentially the headmaster of this school for cheats, the perfectly cast rival Terry-Thomas, with the ideally good Ian Carmichael in the lead role. Memorable scenes involve the now classic wreck of a car sold by some dodgy dealers, and the very fun "hard cheese old boy" tennis sequences. Anyone fond of classic comedy should without doubt give this a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cads</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh I say, School for Scoundrels is surely the ultimate films for cads and caddish wannabees. Forget the battle of the sexes or the classes which was a popular theme in British films of the 1960s. This is about winners and losers.Ian Carmichael is Henry Palfrey who wants to woo the delectable April Smith a girl he has bumped into but is made to look foolish by his chum Raymond Delauney (Terry Thomas) who is out to steal her. Palfrey also is not having much luck at his firm and his attempt to buy a sports car goes wrong as well. He joins the Lifemanship school where the headmaster played by Alistair Sim soon sorts him out in the ways of gamesmanship and oneupmanship.Ian Carmichael plays the weak willed Palfrey really well but soon after his time at school transforms as the cad on the make. He plays a blinder as you really are onside with him when he gets his revenge on the garage that sold the duff car and then when he plays the return game of tennis with Thomas.Terry Thomas, well what can you say. Its the trademark Thomas performance. The moment he claps eyes on April he turns lecherous and uses his weasel charms to get his way. Of course as the table turn you see Thomas getting frustrated, exasperated and even more bad tempered.Alistair Sim again gives another vintage performance as the wily headmaster of the school teaching Palfrey valuable life lessons.The film has cameos from British character actors of the 1950, 60, 70s. Irene Handle, Dennis Price, Hattie Jacques, Hugh Paddick, Peter Jones, John Le Mesurier.The film is a vintage delight. Light and frothy enough with some genteel laughs and held together by Ian Carmichael whilst giving space to Terry Thomas and Alistair Sim to shine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard Cheese for You, Old Man, If You Miss a Day of School</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ian Carmichael is always getting the short end of the stick and feeling inferior to people. He finds out about a school that will boost your self-esteem. Enter April, a lovely lady, he initially bumped into and made a somewhat goofy impression. He tries to take her out. But his reservation was all a misunderstanding, and then Terry-Thomas shows up with all his usual charming flair, saying they're his guests but making Ian pay and monopolizing all of April's attention. From then on, Terry considers her his girl. But, when Ian goes to the school, things change. The founder and teacher of the school is Mr. Potter (the name of the author of the books from which this is based), played by Alistair Sim, who gives a very understated performance. By way of manipulative tricks, one can maneuver people and control conversations and situations so that he comes out on top of everyone, in other words as Alastair says,"to be one up on your fellow man. After all, there's you and then there's everyone else." In the beginning, Terry was in control and was beating Ian in a game of tennis and Terry keeps repeating "Hard Cheese" whenever Ian's serve fails to get over the net, meaning of course, oh, bad luck, but its constant use gets on Ian's nerves and I've never seen a more hilarious tennis match in my life, but later on they have another match. This time, Ian makes him wait and in the process gets Terry totally frustrated and discombobulated even before they get there. Then there's Dennis Price who sold him a clunker of a car, but after Ian's class, he's learned a thing or two about dealing with these salesman. But will love win out for Ian and April? Watch and see, and learn. "School for Scoundrels" is 90 minutes and is one of the best comedies I've seen in a long time, one that will leave you feeling good long after and make you keep repeating to yourself, hard cheese, and laughing all day, and with Terry-Thomas in his element and never better, no one loses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tennis, Anyone?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Act One: The Sap. Act Two: The Zapped.That is the format of this British comedy about a milquetoast who gets his game together and takes charge of his life-personal and professionally, with the help of the titled school, located where, as you follow the pointing signs, take you across the railroad tracks and hidden far from society. It seems he has lost his girl, has been ripped off by an automobile sales company and beaten at tennis by the gap-tooth lothario who stole his girl. He finds revenge is not only sweet but funny as he turns his life around and makes the move to win back everything he has lost (including his dignity) back while teaching those who took advantage a lesson they'll never forget.Watching poor Ian Carmichael get swindled (whether buying the exotic car that resembles "Chity Chitty Bang Bang's" sick uncle or being humiliated at every turn by the droll Terry-Thomas) is hysterical, but seeing him reverse everything to his favor is sweet revenge for everyone who has ever gone through similar situations. When Carmichael gets his revenge (most innocently) on Thomas by turning him into a raging nervous Nancy by delaying their tennis date, Thomas's slow burn is delightful. Carmichael and Thomas play very well off of each other, and the dialog is downright hysterical. The use of British locations add tremendously to the credibility of the plot and make it so much more fun. Add to that the pleasure of Alistair Sim ("A Christmas Carol") as the schoolmaster who teaches Carmichael the art of getting even.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No "hard cheese" here; this movie's a winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story opens in London, and concerns pathetic Henry Palfrey (Ian Carmichael), a milquetoast who earns no respect from anybody, least of all April, the beautiful girl he wants to impress. Henry enrolls in The College of Lifesmanship" run by Mr. Potter (Alastair Sim) and learns how to always be "one-up" rather than "one-down," always in control of every situation and the confident winner in every scenario. Henry's a quick learner, but is his phony demeanor going to win the fair April?If you like British comedies, you're going to love this movie. It's witty and fast-paced and I enjoyed listening to the actors and their posh accents. Carmichael is great as the loser-turned-smooth talker and is easy to like. Sim is droll and clever and Terry-Thomas is, well, Terry-Thomas and no one is funnier than he is. Jeanette Scott is adorable as the object of Henry's affection.This 1960 comedy is hilarious and worth watching more than once. Heartily recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nostalgic but not dated - brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen Potter wrote a series of humorous "self-help" books at around the turn of the 1950s which purported to teach life's losers how to become winners without actually cheating (although manipulating the rules was perfectly permissible).Some years later those books formed the basis of School For Scoundrels, in which the fictitious Yeovil academy (principal S. Potter, played by Alistair Sim) teaches the easily intimidated Henry Palfrey (Ian Carmichael) how to turn the tables on rotter and cad Raymond Delauney (Terry-Thomas) and win back the lovely April Smith (Janette Scott).The script, by Peter Ustinov, turns the spoof techniques of the book into maguffins driving a coherent narrative. The story, and the developments in it, are pleasing and funny, the performances are all excellent and, notwithstanding the fact that the film is clearly rooted in the 1950s, there is a freshness and timelessness about it.And it is fair to say that it is the beneficiary of a beautifully crisp transfer of the monochrome original to DVD.This film is as enjoyable as any of the Ealing comedies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you feel a bit done in by the patronizing ploys of others, it's possible there's more than just "hard cheese" at work. "School For Scoundrels" is a comedy of manners in which applicants at the title school learn to shed some manners in order to get ahead ? and stay there."He who is not one-up is one-down," explains the school's headmaster, Mr. Potter (Alistair Sims), who finds in Ian Carmichael's Henry Palfrey an apt pupil. "Lifemanship is the science of being one up on your opponents at all times. It is the art of making him feel that somewhere, somehow he has become less than you ? less desirable, less worthy ? less blessed."Palfrey, a well-meaning but inept executive, has met the beautiful April (Janette Scott). No sooner has he taken her on a date than he finds the budding relationship horned in upon by a charming cad named Delauney (Terry-Thomas), who sweeps her away with his command of a French menu and a two-seater coupe in which three's a crowd. Can Potter's school teach him a lesson in "lifemanship" and help him exact revenge?Less a movie in a story sense, "School For Scoundrels" is a concept film in which the concept involves using ploys to keep one from getting buried by others - by burying them first. We watch Carmichael's character as he cleverly takes the lessons learned from Potter to use in his life struggle, eventually settling in on a return match against Delauney at the tennis club where he previously suffered his most piercing defeat.Like ianlouisiana points out in an April 2009 review here, this is the sort of film Monty Python could have done a decade later, but with a heavier tread. One thing I enjoyed thinking as I rewatched this was the notion of a Python remake with Eric Idle in the Palfrey role, John Cleese as Delauney, and Michael Palin as Potter. The comedy might have been sharper and the laughs harder. But the principals in this film do work just fine.Carmichael stretches a bit from his amiable persona to good effect, while Terry-Thomas steals every scene he's in as his character steals April. Sim had a wonderfully mordant tone, smoking his stogie and rolling his eyes as he makes Palfrey sign a check for 250 pounds, which he pontifically declares "part of the treatment."Who was directing this movie, anyway? The credits say Robert Hamer, but he was said to have been fired for his alcoholism. I missed the gentle, twisted vibe he gave to his classic "Kind Hearts And Coronets." The tone here is a trifle disengaged, and leans heavily on the source works, a trio of comic "how-to" manuals authored by Stephen Potter. We don't see much in the way of Palfrey's transformation, just Carmichael's smirk and a wicked gleam in his eye once his one-upping bears fruit.I found this very enjoyable, once it got past Palfrey's early miseries, and I think you will, too. However much Palfrey's tricks or ploys (the distinction may be subtle, but important to Mr. Potter) suggest social commentary in the direction of a capitalist society, the real pleasure of the film is watching him get what he's after, even if this treatment does work out in a rather pat way. Weighing in at just over 90 minutes, there's little time for soul-gazing here.The end is the best part, again pat in a way, but giving some amusing shading to the moral questions under review. Potter finds himself in the presence of a student whose abilities at lifemanship astound even him, and the way he lets the audience in on his unease is quite funny.Terry-Thomas fans will enjoy this especially for the way it gives T-T so much to work with, proving him a fine comic actor in his many spotlight moments. Charm may be a cheap commodity in our world, but "School For Scoundrels" shows where it has its uses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie I'd have run a mile from at the time, lumping it together with a host of 'pathetic' British films that thought they were funny and probably were providing you were totally ignorant of Lubitsch, Billy Wilder, Preston Sturges etc. Seen, however, on TV half a century later it's comparatively painless if you're housebound and it's SFS or Mr. Bean. Ian Carmichael takes the lead, as the kind of guy who, after a lifetime of rubbish finally gets a Royal Flush only for a misdeal to be called. His nemesis is Terry Thomas and on offer is Jeanette Scott. At his wits end Carmichael enrols at Stephen Potter's (Alistair Sim) academy where Gamesmanship is the name of the game and - I trust I'm not giving anything away here - graduates with honours and gives Thomas his comeuppance. If this is not too simplistic for you you'll love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An education to be laughed at.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The English author, playwright and ex military man Stephen Potter (1900 - 1969), had produced what can be seen, then and very much so today, as a social order of competitiveness' and to a degree, fair-play, that he was to term the phrase "One-Upmanship", by this terminology it simply means to win, to use the skills of "gamesmanship". This consists of wining, by breaking into the psychology of the opponents' train of thought, to "put them off", to "distract them from their goal of winning by helping and hindering both at the same time". To reach, also, the goal of "winning without actually cheating" and most importantly, to make your opponent think that they had lost fairly, thus, to achieve "One-Upmanship".School for Scoundrels, with their continuing theme of "lifemanship", is the 1960 movie based on the books of Stephen Potter, directed by Cyril Frankel, who goes uncredited, as Robert Hamer, an alcoholic, was unreliable for duties, rarely sober and who died some three years later.Failure is not an option, at The College of Lifemanship, with the brilliantly talented Alastair Sim (1900 - 1976), playing Mr. S. Potter as the shrewd and cunning mentor, and that has the unfortunate Henry Palfrey (Ian Carmichael), turning too for assistance, with his na?ve, bumbling and placid nature, will soon have him in the right direction. With such classes as "Partymanship", "Lifemanship", "Gamesmanship" and "Woo-manship" and other lessons of "UpManShip" that slowly brings about change and substance to his character and backbone alike.School for Scoundrels is a movie that preys upon the inarticulate, meek and mild that exists in all walks of life, which needs that extra push and guidance, and to show the way to victory, possibly. Filmed during the summer of 1959, a very British affair that carries its darker side of the human theme of deviousness is both skilfully adapt to the human need to succeed in the face of obscurity and the need to change for one owns survival. Done in a very humorous fashion, with the cast of Terry-Thomas (humour), Alastair Sim (scheming), Ian Carmichael (genuine) and Janette Scott (naivety), and with bit parts from Hattie Jacques (1922 ? 1980), Irene Handl (1901 ? 1987) and John "Dads Army" Le Mesurier (1912 ? 1983), you really cannot go wrong here, entertaining till the end.There is the serious side to School for Scoundrels, and that to participate in such activities is sometime counter productive, and toward the end, maybe, a little backbone can be built up on just basic human sincerity. Along with School for Scoundrels, try it, you might just be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>
