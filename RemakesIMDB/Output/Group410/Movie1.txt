		<shortDescription>Good comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen countless teeny bopper comedies the past couple of years, and I can honestly say, this wasn't one of them.This was a good, straight forward comedy, with some hilarious moments and a lovable character. The story was also interesting, even though it was very predictable from the beginning (I don't know many people who watch comedies for a complex, deep, mysterious story line anyways) My favorite thing about the movie is all the actors fit in perfectly with the characters they are playing. Especially the main character, who develops through the movie from a weak, shy, kind hearted guy, to somebody who is still kind at heart, but not afraid to defend himself and fight for what he wants. This isn't the best comedy ever, but its good. And I would recommend it to anybody looking for a good laugh out loud movie with lovable characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and Very Funny, But an Old Formula</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fun movie that offers exactly what the previews promise and a little more. John Heder does a great job as does Billy Bob Thornton. The only drawback of the plot is that we've seen it a million times before if you watch this genre of movie. Dr. P (Billy Bob Thornton) plays an overbearing and obnoxious school teacher teaching Roger (John Heder) and the other students how not to be wimps. The purpose of the course backfires when Roger finds out Dr. P does not like to be outdone. This movie could be compared to any comedy where the underdog must overcome the odds to win the girl. Regardless of the predictable plot, the comedy is clever and fun. This movie is worth seeing in the theater. The previews are faithful, but don't give away all of the humor. The humor is consistent throughout and it doesn't leave you tapping you fingers or looking at your watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw a preview - very funny in parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw a preview yesterday, and the movie is very funny in parts. I laughed so hard I cried a couple of times. On the other hand, there are times when the movie seems to drag on too long. In my opinion, this movie is two stories in one - and one works great, and the other not so much. The whole school for scoundrels thing is hysterical. Any scene with Heder and his buddies had the audience roaring. Jon Glaser was my favorite - will somebody get this guy his own movie, please?! But everything outside that was definitely not on the same level. Even the brilliant Ben Stiller, Sara Silverman and David Cross didn't work nearly as well, nor did the scenes of competition between Heder and Thornton. It's still worth seeing for the scenes that do work with his buddies though, as you don't get to laugh that hard too often. - Mikeontheriver</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scoundrel is synonymous with Thornton, Heder is unusual choice for a leading man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger (Jon Heder) is a wimpy parking meter attendant for NYC. After losing his uniform to thieves on the job and being dumped from the big brother program, he is despondent. Add to this his unrequited crush on a beautiful neighbor named Amanda (Jacinda Barrett), and you have a man on the proverbial ropes. However, a well-meaning friend gives him information about a secret class in male self-esteem, run by the harsh Dr. P (Billy Bob Thornton). In class and on outings, Dr. P uses tough tactics to turn his unfortunate students into successful men. But, what happens when Dr. P decides to put the moves on Amanda, after a chance meeting? Does Roger have what it takes to thwart Dr P's efforts and win Amanda for himself? This is a fairly nice but easily disposable film. Thornton is, of course, a natural choice for the scoundrel teacher and he delivers a good-and-slimy performance. Barrett is beautiful and touching as the love interest, adding greatly to the film's enjoyment. Heder, although a good comic performer, seems all wrong as a romantic lead. But, perhaps it is a bit refreshing for someone without the knockout good looks to go for broke in the love department. Ben Stiller has a fine cameo as a wacko ex-student of Dr. P. The setting in NYC and the costumes are nice. All in all, the film is a satisfying view for a rainy day. But, it doesn't seem like a movie that will be remembered or talked about five years down the road.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billy Bob Does It Again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a world full of really moronic teeny bopper movies, thank the heavens we have Billy Bob Thorton. Here in "School For Scoundrels", he is as hilarious as ever! Roger is a loser living in New York City. He has a terrible job, gets no respect from his co-workers, and has never dated a woman. Secretly, he has a crush on his neighbor Amanda, but is so shy, he can't get up the nerve to ask her out. When his friend recommends him to Dr. P (played fabulously by Billy Bob in his trademark type role), his life seems to be finally turning around. However, Dr. P has a secret agenda up his sleeve.Billy Bob does a great job in this film, as well as all the other mostly unknown actors. The story was funny and fun. It's nice to see comedy films geared towards the "older" crowd. Had a few twists and turns I didn't see coming. Very enjoyable film! Overall, I give this film an 8/10.If you enjoy a good comedy that's not all about fart jokes or satire (as all "comedies" seem to be these days), check it out! I'm sure you will enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A barely passable comedy lacking in originality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"School for Scoundrels" tells the well worn story of a pushover who learns to become more assertive so that he can take charge of his life and finally get the girl. I didn't realize that the film was a remake but the fact that I found it hackneyed to begin with gives an idea of the level of originality we're dealing with here.The cast contains a number of talented and funny individuals but they are unfortunately let down by the material. Looking at the cast list it's difficult to believe that the film is as mediocre as it is. The script just doesn't deliver the goods comedically and the story's too unoriginal to grab your attention. The technical aspect is no better than average either but I must admit that the soundtrack was pretty nifty.In the end, I can only recommend this flick if you're absolutely starved for some comedy. There's little to be had here though those who don't mind clichéd stories may appreciate it more than I have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wasn't really feeling it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a bit let down by this movie. Hearing that Billy bob thorton and Jon Heder were in it, (aswell as sarah silverman) I was expecting to get some quality laughs out of this, but what I got was pretty weak. Not that movies like this have incredible stories or plots, but this one was pretty bad, and it moved at an awkward pace to me, that made it even more unbelievable than the genre usually is, As a fan of this sort of platform for a comedy, maybe I'm being to hard on it by other peoples standards, so I don't want to all out not recommend it, but Don't expect as many laughs as the other Billy bob thorton flicks like bad santa, it's light comedy. I usually tend to enjoy these comedies a few times over, but one viewing of this will be enough for me.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts off fresh, then just settles on stale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went to preview screening last night and was pleasantly amused for the first hour but then it just went downhill. Jon Heder's performance is pretty much flat, not bad in any way except that it does nothing to beyond what was on the page. This is typical of most of the cast who seem to be engaged in some sort of paint by numbers exercise. Even Billy Bob Thorton who is well cast as a drill instructor for losers loses steam. Todd Luiso, best known for the wimpy employee in High Fidelity is probably the only actor that manages to turn in something worthy of appreciation. There is an oneupmanship sequence reminiscent of "Rushmore" but only serves to make one wish they were watching that instead. Wait till it's in the video store and you have trouble agreeing what to rent and need something bland.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a comedy of very dark humor which I enjoy. Its not the greatest but it simply fulfills its purpose of giving a enjoyable moment to the viewer. The story is convincing. A loser living in New York with a crappy job, and no self-esteem seeks for help with a man called Dr. P to win the love of his neighbor Amanda. The cast is really good, Billy Bob Thornton in a role that fits him like a glove, his performance was excellent. Jon Heder also with a role that fits him really well, he is constantly evolving as an actor and a comedian. Michael Clark Duncan was hilarious, never thought he could be that funny. The brief appearance from Ben Stiller as Lonnie was really convincing. The supporting cast like Horatio Sanz, Todd Louiso and Luis Guzmán is a really good complement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneducating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adequately entertaining. Billy Bob Thornton and Jon Heder make mildly interesting, obviously unmatched adversaries. Talented supporting cast also supplies some interest, but no character is fully developed. Michael Clarke Duncan comes the closest, but his hostility, his back story, his orientation is unexplained and sometimes inexplicable. Jacinda Barrett plays a nice girl, and does a nice job. Some laughs, interrupted by huge plot holes. What is Sarah Silverman doing, except being nasty? The premise is funny. Who hasn't felt like "the nice guy who finishes last", with the exception of people like the self-proclaimed "Doctor P", Billy Bob Thornton, who teaches the class of the weak and the meek to become lions. The overall mediocrity of the mess is pretty much attributable to director Todd Phillips ("Old School", "Starsky and Hutch"). Wait for the DVD, and rent it for $1.00; don't buy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When is a remake REALLY a remake?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading the other comments on this film showed that few people realize the title, at least, hails from a British film released in 1960, which while having the same name, is fundamentally different. Indeed, I could find NO reference to the original in the film's credits (which I suspect saved them some CASH).Which brings into focus the whole issue of "remakes'.For instance, the recent film entitled "The Italian Job" was really NOT a remake. It was merely the central character's favourite film and it "inspired" him to use the techniques in the film to pull off a job. In fact, the recent film might have done better with a completely DIFFERENT title, as it must have irritated many viewers who were expecting a true remake. In fact, if you forget about the original film, the "remake" - as a stand-alone film - is actually quite GOOD.The same could be said of "The House On Haunted Hill".On the other hand, TRUE remakes are usually RUBBISH. Treatments of great modern French films and classic British and American films almost ALWAYS suffer in comparison with their originals. This writer avoids them like the plague - I only watched this one (on TV) to see how the subtlety of the original's theme of Lifemanship, Gamesmanship and One-Upmanship had been handled by Hollywood - it hadn't.In fact, apart from Billy Bob Thornton's character name of "Dr P" (an obvious reference to Alistair Sim's character - "Potter" - taken from the original writer of the books which formed the basis for the original film) and the inclusion of a game of tennis (Ian Carmichael did not HIT Sim in the original!) the only thing taken from the original was the concept of a secret school designed to turn losers into winners.But in the original, this was achieved by the use of "ploys" designed to instill doubt and confusion in the students' opponents - "Your opponent is everyone who is not YOU" - while in the "remake", the "techniques" involved were more akin to a self-assertiveness class, with subtlety being replaced by naked aggression.So, as with the "remakes" of "The Italian Job" and "The House On Haunted Hill", this is a film that did itself NO favours by trying to be another example of Hollywood's OBSESSION with remakes. As with the afore-mentioned, it was actually quite a good film on IT'S OWN MERIT.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than Expected *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went with trepidation and worried that this movie would fall on its face. However, I was pleasantly surprised and thought it was put together well, the acting was above average and the story line was acceptable and held my attention. John Heder did show acting ability and exceeded my expectations. He did well at portraying a schlep in the beginning of the movie and then transformed into a competitive stud at the end. Jacinda Barrett was very cute and acted well and BB Thorton played his part well. Michael Clarke Duncan, Ben Stiller and Sarah Silverman added a dimension of humor that seemed to complete the main characters. I thought it was well written and that it seemed to flow at a good pace and developed the characters as well as you can in a 100 minute movie. I'm not saying it's an award movie of any kind, but it exceeded my expectations and was worth my $5 (matinee price in my area).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laughs are few and far between</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Heder stars as a, surprise surprise, nerdy New York City meter-maid who decides to boost his self-confidence by taking a secretive class taught by Billy Bob Thornton. Dr. P (Thornton) is anything but friendly, highly abrasive with the class of individuals who are struggling with their manhood. Thornton evokes his dead-pan character from Bad Santa here. When Roger (Heder) shoots to the head of the class, he is in for trouble when he finds out Dr. P is putting the moves on the woman, Amanda (Barrett), in his apt. building who he wants to date. The slap-stick antics ensue as he enlists the help of some of the other students from the class to exact his revenge.If you are expecting the same sort of humor that director Todd Phillips delivered in Old School, you'll be left waiting for long stretches as I was. The laughs are in fact few and far between. The film is actually more of a light romantic comedy than anything else, which was unexpected. I found the funniest scenes to include Amanda's roommate played by the hilarious Sarah Silverman. Heder seems to continue to be cast as these nerdy individuals, talk about type-casting. Thornton has a knack for creating these sinister characters, but this one is a far cry from his Bad Santa. I give the film credit for having a nice romantic feel between Heder and Barrett. However, you'll keep waiting for the big laughs that you expect from the filmmakers and they never come, that's why this film disappointed me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Billy Bob Thortan so I gave this one a shot. Billy Bob had his typical bad attitude and was extremely funny at times but it just felt too much like a lesser version of anger management.The lead character is a wimp who is a meter maid and in love with this woman that the class instructor comes to fall in love with. The class teaches him to be assertive and take what he wants. It really was the same plot as Anger Management.The big difference between this and Anger Management is that Anger Management was much funnier with pairing Jack Nicolson with Adam Sandler funnier myself.It is basically the same plot but this movie is worth renting when it comes out on video for decent entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very, very typical movie. As soon as one sees the leading lady, the plot outline is clear: guy charms lady, guy seemingly betrays lady, guy gives speech, guy gets girl in the end. It's annoying how, in a movie filled with actors I love, they couldn't manage anything over okay.Don't be mistaken, though; there are some very funny moments in the movie. Seeing Heder nail Billy Bob over and over again on the tennis court was probably the highlight of the movie for me. Some parts are so typical it hurts, though, like the ending in the airport. Every plot "twist" was so obvious that it had me laughing, in a bad way.Overall, it's the kind of movie that you rent if you're bored and can't think of anything else to get. Do NOT buy this on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I left this one feeling very disappointed and frustrated. However, that can be in good part attributed to the last 5-10 minutes of the film. An ending, for my part, can make or break a movie.Oddly enough, I remembered there was a decent amount of humour in it. This, triggered when I happened to catch the trailer on the internet while looking for the latest in lonelygirl15 updates.So, it's not all bad, but it's really not particularly creative or hilarious either. Speaking of which, you could find a suspiciously similar, but a much better, plot line and entire story in Anger Management.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well written, clever and funny...a battle of wits and love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give Jon Heder great respect for doing everything he can to continue his career following his type casted performance as the brutally stupid Napoleon Dynamite which became an instant cult classic. Having seen everything he has done since that film I think this is truly his first step at escaping that role. It's still a comedy and he's still the underdog but he's smart, and cute funny, and he gets to match wits and kick ass against Billy Bob Thorton which highlights this film and makes it worthwhile. It's really an underdog film, and it's about being yourself. The laughs aren't really roll on the floor but more of a subtle dark humor with so much of it basing itself around the battle between these two men...the self confident, conceited, vindictive Dr. P, and the much more down to earth and reluctantly confident, romantic, and determined Roger. It's actually a very clever and intelligent and for the most part originally done comedy.Jon Heder of course heads up the cast as Roger. One of the truly delightful things about Heder's performance in this film is that he is so just a buddy. He's a normal, regular, guy with some real confidence problems and you can't help but relate to the guy. He looks and acts so down to earth and that might be Heder's real charm in breaking out into other roles besides Napoleon (which I never thought was all that spectacular.) He is really good in this part and you'll root for him 100%. His teacher/mentor and then ultimate adversary is the deliciously bad Billy Bob Thorton as the mysterious Dr. P. I mean overall Thorton's character is just a complete and utter A**hole...and I never, ever swear in my reviews but that is exactly what he is. Dr. P is mean and ignorant but yet somehow manages to inspire non-confident men into being mean machines themselves and taking what they want. Thorton is just awesome in this role. You hate the guy and yet find yourself drawn to his weird style. Finally he takes a rather psychotic turn and goes after Heder's girl that Heder absolutely loves launching a complete war between the men with no holds barred. Both of them play a mean game and in the process Heder really shines with his tactics considering how twisted Thorton's character is. But the comedy in the film definitely peaks with their battle. Both actors are terrific!! Jacinda Barrett plays the object of both their affections and despite a small more subtle role she does quite well and manages to have good chemistry with both Thorton and Heder but especially Heder. And she's not classically, outright beautiful but has a more girl next door to her look which helps with the part and the story. Michael Clarke Duncan is hilarious as the equally cruel teacher's assistant Lesher. Duncan's comedy comes entirely from him being so enormous and physical at the same time but his role is classic. Also honorable mention to the supporting cast of comedians including the under rated Horatio Sanz, Matt Walsh, and Todd Louiso. Most useless role in a film gets handed out without hesitation to Ben Stiller who makes a useless cameo that is probably supposed to spike people's interest but he is forced on you in true Stiller fashion. Stiller's comedy doesn't fit this type of film because it isn't a laugh out loud, stupid comedy but far more intelligent and he just doesn't fit. I suppose he likely had a hand in producing or something so he had to make himself a role but he wasn't necessary but graciously the part is small. The director is also a Frat Pack director so it makes sense he brought Stiller aboard.However that's not to say anything bad about director and co-writer Todd Phillips because he does an excellent job. I think his direction style is subtle and he lets talented actors do their thing like Heder and Thorton. He has done a lot of comedy but it has mostly been more the gross out "Porky's" type humor and this is a nice change for him and I think he should hopefully do some much more intelligent comedy like this one. School for Scoundrels is definitely one of the better comedies I have seen as of recently. Some won't like it because it's far more subtle and intelligent but that is it's charm and adults will like it's style of comedy. I do recommend absolutely!! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My 14 year old son and I had high hopes for this movie. Theater was packed for the sneak preview with 13 - 18 males. Some funny parts but it is cheap humor and the ending is so weak you expected a bigger payoff. Not to mention you will have to suspend your disbelief big time during the airport scene. The preview for Mr. Woodcock (also starring Billy Bob) was funnier than the whole movie was. However, some of the comments I heard for the crowd as we were leaving, "Funnest movie I have seen in a long time". "Would go see it again". Maybe the movie was targeted for that age range and it might pay off for them. But, the laughs were crotch shots and other physical stunts. Anyway, I expected more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>School for Scoundrels (2006): Dir: Todd Phillips / Cast: Jon Heder, Billy Bob Thornton, Jacinda Barrett, Michael Clarke Duncan, Ben Stiller: Comedy about learning opposition to what is really best. Jon Heder plays a shy individual with no self confidence and working at a job with no future. He learns of a self confidence course and enrolls under the teachings of Dr. P. This leads to competed affection for a young woman in his building. Observant with twist after twist in the finale. Directed by Todd Phillips as a followup to Old School and certainly an improvement over the dreaded Road Trip. Heder plays a role viewers may relate to going from pushed over to being challenged and eventually successor. Billy Bob Thornton plays Dr. P who covers his tracks while dishing out lies. Jacinda Barrett plays the standard love interest whose only interesting feature is that she is Australian. The idea that Heder is fighting for her leaves no surprise as to how this turns out. Michael Clarke Duncan plays an associate to Dr. P who is nothing more than a thug. Ben Stiller plays a depressed student who was a victim of the teacher's antics in the past. Although a message of self respect does exist, this film seems more interested in bathroom humour than anything else. Like the class itself it presents a potential theme then buries it within nonsense leaving effective plot twists to gain honors. Score: 6 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its comedic heights are present, but its dramatic ones should not be shortchanged</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger (Jon Heder) is a meter-reader with little confidence and not a lot to live for. Browbeaten, verbally abused, and harassed by everyone in his life, he takes the advice of his close friend (David Cross) to take a self-esteem class taught by a man named "Dr. P" (Billy Bob Thornton), who is quickly found to be the kind of self-esteem teacher to teach you the ways of confidence and self-worth by providing you with even more verbal abuse in your life. Roger's ultimate goal - besides earning respect from others - is to win the heart of his neighbor, an Australian graduate student named Amanda (Jacinda Barrett), who he can't seem to talk to without being met with a panic attack or fainting.Todd Phillips' School for Scoundrels is a remake of the 1960 film of the same name, which I can only imagine to be a bit nicer and less bossy in its tone and approach to its material. However, despite its over-arching mean-spiritedness as one of its themes, School for Scoundrels actually manages to be a consistently funny comedy, mostly thanks to its capable band of actors, all of whom have had some work in the comedy field and know just what to say and how to say it when the time is right.For starters, consider Billy Bob Thornton, who is simply fearless as Dr. P here. Thornton has a way of assimilating well to any given role, be it a foul-mouthed mall-Santa, a questionable folk from the backwoods, or a browbeating self-esteem teacher. Thornton works well here because he's as brash and as off-color as the material, often assisted by his character's assistant "Lesher," played by Michael Clarke Duncan. Now consider Jon Heder who, before this, only got to show his skills in one of the most lackluster comedies of the last decade. Heder is a solid, sympathetic character here, especially for those who can see his characters' struggles and hunger for acceptance and are willing to buy into it. Some characters in films are the reason for their own problems (take virtually any Adam Sandler film from the nineties), but Heder's Roger is simply a bit geeky and a tad uncoordinated, and for that, is unfortunately the target for abuse and ridicule. On those notes alone, his character is easy to side with because he is relatively blameless.Alongside Heder are the likes of Sarah Silverman as Amanda's friend who continues to give Roger a hard time, Horatio Sanz, Aziz Ansari, David Cross, Dan Fogler, Luis Guzmán, Jim Parsons, and Ben Stiller (however, in a role of questionable value), all of whom very competent comedians who accentuate the quick-witted qualities that got them to that level in the first place. While School for Scoundrels gets by almost entirely on the charisma of its actors, Todd Phillips and Scot Armstrong's writing shouldn't go unnoticed. For the most part, the writing duo create an unabashedly fun, silly comedy with enough consistent laughs to warrant a recommendation.The only struggle for the film is how it wants to achieve its climax, in this case, making the entire "get the girl" subplot too silly and way too overblown. The film was grounded in a certain, goofy reality up until maybe the eighty-minute mark, and for that reason, the film becomes a bit of a struggle to continue to buy into during its last twenty-five minutes. Regardless, it can't derail the comedic talent at hand, along with Jon Heder's Roger, who, for once, isn't picked on because of his own stupidity but for his own genial manner and geeky appearance. He's a character I can see many identifying with.Three years after the release of School for Scoundrels (which bombed at the box office and has now, eight years later, faded into almost complete obscurity), Todd Phillips hit a comedy homerun, financially, after directing all three Hangover films, effectively transcending his career into heavily-raunchy material and leaving geniality behind with School for Scoundrels. This is kind of an upsetting fact because this film has the unsung ability to identify when the two sequels leaching off the original Hangover were nothing but an annoyance to moviegoers. The film at hand rarely achieves comedic heights, but its dramatic ones are worth noting and appear to have been grossly shortchanged.Starring: Billy Bob Thornton, Jon Heder, Jacinda Barrett, Sarah Silverman, Horatio Sanz, David Cross, Dan Fogler, Luis Guzmán, Ben Stiller, Jim Parsons, and Aziz Ansari. Directed by: Todd Phillips.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jon Heder, dialing down the gawkiness of his breakthrough role in Napoleon Dynamite, stars as Roger, a spineless New York City meter maid prone to panic attacks and being picked on. He can't even muster the nerve to ask out the girl next door, Amanda, a warm-hearted Australian. Roger hits bottom when he's dumped (again) as a big brother, leading him to a secretive, cash-only class taught by Thornton's Dr. P, a self-styled self-help guru who shows weak men how to unleash their "inner lion." This films has an interesting story and premise but isn't all that great and it seems very usual compared to other films. At times it seems like it doesn't know what type of comedy it wants to be. Is it a black comedy that isn't dark enough? Or a dumb comedy that isn't stupid enough, or a gross-out comedy that isn't yucky enough? Or is it really just a romance comedy that isn't sweet enough? It starts out as a silly comedy then turns into a romantic comedy and ends that way. The film could have been much better but it wasn't so bad. Not very funny either. Decent and watchable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In New York, dorky loser Jon Heder (as Roger Waddell) gets pushed around at work. And, he can't pick up flirty Australian neighbor Jacinda Barrett (as Amanda Richards). Taking a friend's advice, Mr. Heder enrolls in a self-confidence class run by ballsy Billy Bob Thornton (as "Dr. P."). Then, after Heder learns how to "roar like a lion" and live dangerously enough to attract Ms. Barrett, he finds Mr. Thornton becoming a rival for her affection.A gay subplot involves Thornton's burly henchman Michael Clarke Duncan (as Lesher), who turns out to be sodomizing Thornton's students. One traumatized rape victim, Ben Stiller (as Lonnie Ratcliff), shows up with revenge on his mind. The tennis match damage inflicted on Thornton, and the sock stuffed in Heder's mouth are two highlights. But, director Todd Phillips' "School for Scoundrels" never rises above the usual sophomoric chuckles.*** School for Scoundrels (9/29/06) Todd Phillips ~ Jon Heder, Billy Bob Thornton, Jacinda Barrett, Ben Stiller</fullReview>

		<fullReview>School for scoundrels. I must admit, the title was a bit confusing; Surely school for losers would be more apt, if a little harsh. John Heder is actually quite a good lead actor, not quite as dopey as his character is in napoleon dynamite. Billy Bob Thornton plays nearly exactly the same character as he played with less success in Mr Woodcock. And the only character who really grated was the ultra rude flatmate of the love interest (Sarah Silverman) who annoyed me so much as no-one is actually going to be that rude surely!The last half an hour was a hit and miss affair, some really well done other parts beyond cheesy, but not a bad way to spend a couple of hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine the poor nerd-like Roger, who is humiliated on a daily basis by his co-workers. He is such a pathetic individual that even the Big Brother group he mentors want to get rid of him. What to do? How about enrolling in a school that will give him the skills that will help him overcome his own shortcomings. For that, he goes to Dr. P's school where supposedly he will learn, among other things, how to overcome his inability to deal with the tormentors he faces everywhere and then get to have great sex that has been denied to him.The premise of this comedy must have sounded great to the people behind the project. Todd Phillips, after all, is a major talent that has done much better. Writing the screenplay together with Scot Armstrong, and loosely based on the original English film of the same title, one would have expected a laughter riot. After all, the casting seemed made in heaven.The pairing of Billy Bob Thornton and Jon Heder, should have yielded an edgier comedy, but alas, it was not meant to be. One cannot blame the actors involved because the material given for them to act, doesn't hold many surprises. There are isolated parts that are funny and work. Most of the time the gags feel flat.Even though the end product is not what one expected, "School of Scoundrels" has its moments and it could be a film to watch with friends if the group is into a party mood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Jon Heder. I liked him in "Benchwarmers". I liked him (less) in "Blades of Glory". He's a likable guy.The problem with "School for Scoundrels" is that Jon's inherent likability is all about his inability to win through. Even when he wins, it's more about everyone winning than Jon's characters winning at his "opponents" expense."School for Scoundrels" tells the story of a bunch of losers who encounter a teacher who turns them into lesser losers. They're all very happy for the uprating in coolness, but at what price? Throw in a plot that twists and turns, and then keeps twisting and turning, and an annoying cameo by the usually film-stealing Ben Stiller, and what unfolds is a tale that ultimately left me feeling uninterested in this movie...chiefly because it offers nothing by the way of interesting outcomes. Which is unfortunate because one plot twist more (or indeed fewer) and you'd have something worth talking about.The movie ultimately falls between two stools. And just so we're clear, the one stool is a "Revenge of the Nerds' remake, and the other stool is an "Anger Management" remake - see what I mean? Oh, and Billy-Bob Thornton. Yeah. Whatever. Don't see what all the fuss is about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this movie. I usually find Billy Bob Thorton fun to watch when he's in reprobate mode. I like "Ice Harvest", "Bad Santa", and the "Bad News Bears" remake. He was good in this as the aggressive dude teaching wimps how to be alpha males.The script could have used some work. The first half, the interesting half, had kind of a "Fight Club" theme. It was concerned with manhood, being a winner, and shooting your classmates in the nuts with a paintball gun. That's comedy! (I dig slapstick - sue me.) Then, as Joe Bob Briggs used to say, the plot gets in the way of the story. It runs out of gas and interest as it morphs into a boy-gets-girl thing. The actions and choices of the two antagonists aren't especially interesting in the second half until maybe at the very end.I think part of the problem is the casting. I don't think Jon Heder is the right guy for the sympathetic loser. He's great as an over-the-top dork. But he didn't engage my sympathy or interest in this role. A lot of the characterization was external, so he didn't have a lot to work with. Lame job, OK. Pajamas. OK. Needs a little...more.

		<fullReview>There are few funny moments in "School for Scoundrels" (2006). I am under the impression that John Hedder is being typecast in silly comedies ever since his "Napoleon Dynamite" success. This film was pretty much as bad as "The benchwarmers" I am not at all a big fan of remakes, especially films that originally stared Terry Thomas. I would appear that Hollywood has nothing better to make, so they tap into classic 40's, 50's, and 60's British comedies and remake them, like the awful "ladykillers" version with Tom Hanks. I found Ben Stiller to be mildly amusing, and Michael Clark Duncan had a couple of funny parts, but the laughs were few and far between. 4 out of 10</fullReview>

However, I found myself extremely bored in the movie, especially with the cliché character of Jon Heder that is really getting stale. The only decent thing about this movie were Billy Bob Thorton and Michael Clarke Duncan's maniacal characters. Ben Stiller had a funny role as well, which should have been focused on a bit more. The outline is almost identical to Anger Management except this movie deals with a loser as opposed to a guy who is "angry." An "odd" therapist comes into play, screws the main character over, they fight over the girl, the main character wins, the end. If you've seen Anger Management (which was sadly better than this movie), you have no reason to watch this unless extreme boredom sets in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My new definition of irony...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I was about to do a search on this film, I actually began to type in the words "school of missed opportunity", because that is what constantly comes to mind when trying to summarise this ill-conceived attempt to capitalise on Billy Bob Thornton's sudden notoriety as a master of flagrantly abusive interaction. And it is not like School For Scoundrels did not have a lot going for it, because the actors are rock-solid at all times. It is only when the screenplay lets them down that things really go awry. Jon Heder is a dopey foil for Billy Bob Thornton's merging of his Bad Santa character with the softer side of R. Lee Ermey's schtick. However, a problem emerges when we want to explore exactly why Heder's character so desperately yearns to be more assertive than his initial configuration allows. The screenplay errs in overpopulating the cast with too many characters and a lot of lopsided development. With the tuition fee that Thornton demands early in the piece, the initial class size looks like it could almost buy him a house in New York State.This, unfortunately, is where the act begins to fall apart. In addition to a large classroom full of individuals that wind up unnamed, we also have to contend with the ins and outs of love interest Jacinda Barrett's social circle. The trick to a comedy like this is that one has to make the characters either pathetic in an endearing way or abusive in an endearing way. Bad Santa aced this trick. School For Scoundrels falls flat on its butt thanks to some performances from Sarah Silverman and David Cross that leave the more Powell-Aspie types in the audience like myself wanting to punch them. A film like this one needs as few main characters as possible, and these miserable sacks, along with half of the class, would have been the first to get deleted from my script. Aside from adding nothing to the story, they leave a bad taste in the mouth and distract from what actually works. Adding to the woes is that Thornton's presence leaves one constantly comparing SFS to Bad Santa, and SFS keeps coming off second best.Thornton is capable of playing this role in his sleep, and the manner in which he delegates to Michael Clarke Duncan would have provided an interesting dynamic had the film been willing to go all of the way and turn into the sort of boot camp for Bad Santas that the audience might expect. Unfortunately, the cast overcrowding leaves Thornton and Duncan battling each other for space. Fortunately, they are more able to effectively manage the problem than the rest of the cast. If the focus had been more upon them, the film would have been a nonstop laugh-riot. Unfortunately, the film instead chooses to cast them as villains or antagonists. If Dr. P had been a genuinely altruistic man who merely wanted to help his fellow man reach his fellow man's full potential or something where a bit more thought is a requisite, for example, that might have made for more comedy. Still, Thornton and Duncan take a script that often seems to have added them as an afterthought and squeeze it for all it is worth.No, the real problem is that their students are the kind of people that real drill sergeants of Thornton's or Duncan's apparent inclinations would look at and declare beyond helping. Heder is required to portray a gormless wimp at the beginning of the film, and a powerful man of action at the end. The problem is that he is quite a long way more convincing at one than he is at the other. People who have seen Bad Santa or The Ice Harvest will know which I mean already. I can already think of a thousand actors beside John Cusack who would have been a million times better in Heder's role than Heder. Hell, even Ben Stiller, who makes a cameo appearance in the final act, would have been a better choice. Nowhere is this more apparent than in scenes where Heder is in the same frame with Thornton. One of them is a charismatic man who one would take seriously if he told you he was going to punch you senseless. You do not have to have seen either actor's previous films in order to work out which I am describing there. Someone in casting should have seen that problem well in advance of production.By now, I am sure that it sounds like I am condemning the film outright. However, with the element of surprise, SFS is a decent and watchable little comedy. The problem is that in the hands of a director or writer with more moxie, it could have been so much more. This gulf between what the film is and what the film could have been is on display from the second Thornton announces his presence in that indescribable manner one comes to expect of him. The A.V. Club is right on the money when they inform us that SFS is too flabby to be funny, as if it needed a drill instructor of its own in order to whip it into shape. Speaking as someone who unfortunately finds himself in need of a bit more than just Dr. P, I felt somewhat cheated once the credits had begun to roll. When I rented School For Scoundrels, I thought I had ordered a veal schnitzel with some fries and gravy. What I got instead was a steak that was comprised of fifty percent fat and ten percent bone. Sure, you can cull a decent sandwich out of this film, but that is the limit of it.School For Scoundrels is a five out of ten film. It is worth a rental, maybe watching once, but the results you get from watching it all the way through will be inverse to your expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nothing new</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this with an open mind, expecting a light comedy from familiar faces, who seemed well cast. Aside from a couple of twists on some familiar gags, I was disappointed by its general predictability, forced dialogue and flaccid performances (even by Billy Bob). I hadn't seen Heder in anything since Napoleon Dynamite; I kept my distance from the handful he's appeared in for various reasons, but was excited to see him in something new. I hope he improves as an actor, but for now I just don't think he's got the chops even for light fare like this one. Billy Bob's phoned-in performance was full of recycled lines. Todd Louiso and Luis Guzman provided the best performances of the bunch, but they certainly didn't "carry the team."Not that a comedy like this needs raunch to be funny, but when they make a decision to go for an R rating, rather than the traditional PG-13 for a movie like this, the filmmakers are sending a message that the envelope is going to be pushed--that the audience is going to see something new. There was plenty of opportunity for envelope-pushing with Thornton and Sara Silverman on hand, but the movie felt more like a PG movie adorned with a few more swear words and a couple of awkward nods to Deliverence. I honestly think this movie would have found a better audience had it been cleaned-up for a younger audience, who perhaps haven't seen a dozen other movies much like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Following his Old School Road Trip, and long before his epic Hangover, Todd Phillips went back in time to remake the classic School For Scoundrels, with disappointing results. The story follows an insecure loser in love, who takes a class on how to become more appealing to women. His teacher is a total player, who teaches the class to the best of his abilities, but in the end, he has the same goal as the others, and ultimately falls for the same girl as the loser. When seeing a Todd Phillips comedy, that is unrated, and features Billy Bob Thornton, you should expect to see a raunchy good time, but that's not what happens here. To Phillips, keeping as close to the original story was more important than modernizing it for today's audiences, and the result was a film that fails to live up to expectations. This film needed a major injection of raunch, the kind Thornton became known for in films like Bad Santa. Instead you get what amounts to an average, mediocre, comedy. In this film, Thornton is paired with Jon Heder, Napoleon Dynamite himself, but as with that film, his monotone lovable loser act, gets old very quickly. This film has all the makings of a wild ride and a terrific comedy, but instead it falls flat on it's face, as just another ordinary, run of the mill, romantic comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roger (Jon Heder) is a meek meter reader who gets hit with panic attacks. He's in love with his neighbor Amanda (Jacinda Barrett). She lives with her smart-mouthed roommate Becky (Sarah Silverman). Ian (David Cross) gives him a phone number. It's a strange class run by Lesher (Michael Clarke Duncan) and Dr. P (Billy Bob Thornton). Then Dr. P starts dating Amanda and Roger gets help from former student Lonnie (Ben Stiller).Todd Phillips is trying for wacky but I find the pathetic Roger really annoying. His annoying weakness doesn't even make sense. It opens with two guys shooting and robbing him but they don't even mention filing a report. They obviously have the thugs' names since he already wrote them the ticket. It's a really stupid opening and worst of all, it's not funny.I don't blame Jon Heder for his character. It's just the way it's written. Neither him nor Billy Bob is funny. The only person who gets laughs regularly is Sarah Silverman. That is all her. That shows how a Todd Phillips comedy works. He comes up with a premise but it takes some wacky comedians to make it work. 'Road Trip' has Tom Green among others. 'Old School' has Will Ferrell. 'The Hangover' has Zach Galifianakis. This one doesn't really have anybody like that.The paint ball section is funny for about 2 seconds when Roger gets shoot over and over again. Then I don't understand why the rest of it would actually be funny. It's what happens for most of the movie. It leaves me scratching my head looking for the comedy. There is a very lightweight rom-com in the center of this. I do mean very lightweight. Other than being pretty, the affable Jacinda Barrett contributes nothing to the comedy. She's simply the trophy. The movie just makes her look stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some audience likes watching Billy Bob Thornton act like a witty smart ass, and in this he is basically a bully that tries to act like a mentor and acts like a smart ass throughout the whole film. I really hated Billy Bob Thornton's character in this movie, in fact it tries to make the audience despise him. There was just no charisma or any witty humor with him this time around. He is basically a prick throughout the whole thing and it's only in it for what he wants and what he wants only, while stomping over others to get it. Jon Heder's character is basically a pansy and a loser in society and is in lover with some girl he thinks he would never have a chance with. So he looks for a mentor, but finds the WRONG one that would screw his life apart and makes everything a test. Never had any high hopes for this movie, but it was just very very slightly better than I thought it would be. The twist and turns are actually predictable if you sort of pay attention, which was for me a bit difficult to do cause I lost interest for most part of this film. I didn't find any of the stuff that happens to be funny, just kinda irritating cause one guy they want you to root for is a major pansy and the so called mentor is a huge prick. That give worldly advice about how to take from society while stomping over other people in order to do so. There is somewhat of a moral it lacked morality, but it doesn't matter cause a lot of stuff was just sloppy and most of the characters were just unlikable. But seeing a uber wimp gradually start to stand up for himself and fight for the girl he is in love with was somewhat nice and yet disappointing. It isn't a terrible movie, but the film was dull and boring for the most part and even has a weak ending to go with it. Although since the way the plot is going there is almost noway around it.4.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Todd Phillips is known for making funny, original comedies. From the director of Road Trip, Old School, Starsky &amp; Hutch, and The Hangover comes School for Scoundrels.Billy Bob Thornton and Jon Heder star in this funny movie. Heder plays Roger, a hopeless romantic who wants to better his life and get the attention of a girl named Amanda. He attends a class taught by Dr. P, played by Thornton.Dr. P is not afraid to say it like it is. He believes that people have self help books because their self sucks. He has morals that are unusual, but knows how to actually make his students better themselves.Roger has even more to fight for as Dr. P always chooses one student to give a much harder time to. Roger is that student and doesn't know what to do. Later, he stands up to Dr. P and ends up graduating his class.This movie has some laughs, but lacks some morality. It is still a solid effort by director Todd Phillips. Phillips knows how to make a movie and original, but this one was a little cheesy, but still a sold effort. There is also a hilarious cameo by Ben Stiller as a former student who also got picked on by Dr. P.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was a decent but not outstanding British comedy (1960) by the same name as this film, starring that great comic actor Alastair Sim, who also was wonderful as Scrooge in 1951's Christmas Carol. It was based loosely (the books resemble self-improvement manuals) on Stephen Potter's well-worth reading "One Upmanship" and "Lifemanship" books. Those hilarious best-selling books provide the reader with a guide as to how to use guile to get even with someone you identify as worthy of getting even with, or as Potter put it, "creative intimidation." To some extent the 2006 "School for Scoundrels" could also be said to be based on those Potter books. While the original books and the 1960 film envisioned a small private college that taught the art of being one-up (if you are not one up, you're one down), the 2006 version is a single self-improvement course taught secretly by a masterful rogue (Billy Bob Thornton) who calls himself Dr. P, to a group of low self-esteem "losers." His course resembles extreme confidence building sink or swim exercises more than one-upmanship. But he also goes one-on-one to put down the best of his students. It is explained that Dr. P is very competitive and shoots down anyone who might approach his level of skill. When facially challenged Roger (Jon Heder) unexpectedly is standing out as the best of his class, a one-upmanship contest between the master and the student gets underway.This is a fun film to watch; not at all sophomoric and not leaning on the slapstick approach. In addition to the two leads, the rest of the cast includes, among others, well known comic Sarah Silverman and comic actor Ben Stiller. Stiller is about as good as he gets (he is usually in films that are not my taste in comedy, although I recently saw him in something I really enjoyed.) On the other hand, the lines given to Sarah Silverman just make her character brassy rather than funny and are not up to the caliber of her stand-up comedy that she writes for herself.</fullReview>

As Heder's confidence grows, he begins to show his true interest in the girl across the hall from his own apartment, but things really take a turn for the worse as Thornton pretends to show an interest in the girl, too, in an effort to get Heder to the next level.I thought this film would be one of those teenager flicks that would be profanity every other word, but it wasn't. The premise of the movie was all right, but the plot probably could have used a little more work. Someone turned me onto this film, telling me that it would not be at all like I expected, and I rather enjoyed the time I spent watching it, but, looking back, it seemed like there's something missing to the film. The chemistry between Thornton and Heder was very good but it just lacked that "something" that would have made this a great film. Thornton has had those roles lately that just make you want to hate him (Mr. Woodcock, for example), and I feel that he has a range of much more than he's been trying to accomplish, lately. It just felt like the cast and crew just sat down, laid out the movie plot, then filmed it.7 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you like Billy Bob Thornton? How about the many wives he has had? His movies? All the above? Well, this movie is probably for you. Instead of being a mall Santa or flying into space, he runs a "class" for loveless losers and takes their money. Problem is, some people like John Heder get too good.So Billy Bob proceeds to try to win over his woman (Jacinda Barrett) and starts an all out war with Heder. Things get a little crazy and some of the things that happen are quite hilarious, although its not always a 'laffer' at some points.And how Michael Clarke Duncan got involved beats me. But at least he is shown some love in this movie.Overall, not bad. I like the acting in this one. "B"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Funny Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By this time we all knew Jon Heder from his famed performance in Napoleon Dynamite. Now when this came out it put Heder in a whole new perspective because of the romance edge to this movie. I think that a lot of people did not like this movie, but it is a little underrated in my book. It does deliver the laughs more than once and you will find yourself mildly entertained once again by the writing of Todd Philips and Scot Armstrong. This was actually a very decent comedy with that romance factor added in as well. Jon Heder shows great on screen chemistry with Billy Bob Thornton as they both one-up each other to win over this girl. A very outrageous comedy that is worth seeing at least once.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and great as ever. Billy Bob plays Dr. P, a teacher for losers with low self esteem. Roger is a new student, played by the funny Jon Herder. He wants to stop being pushed around and to get a girl, Amanda. We get several funny scenes of Dr. P asking his students to be more confrontational. At the paint ball game, Roger proves to be learning quickly, which causes Dr. P to want to one up him. So, Dr. P makes a play for Amanda. He says he is a doctor and sweet talks her all the while infuriating Roger. He even convinces Amanda that Roger needs mental help. But in the end Roger uses the help of friends to get back at Dr. P. He almost gets tricked again but remembers one of Dr. P's number one rules. Lie, Lie, Lie. Ben Stiller makes a cameo as one of Dr. P's former students who was traumatized by him. He wants revenge.FINAL VERDICT: Quite a few funny scenes. Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watch "The Man Who Wasn't There" and "Dead Man" i have big respect to Billy Bob Thornton specially because of his terrific performance in the first film that i mention. But now i have been watching some of the recent films with Billy Bob and i have enjoyed all so i can say that i'm a fan of BBT. Some weeks ago i knew for the first time of this film because i see the DVD in a store, i don't remember if this film was released in the cinemas of Mexico City and i doesn't have any references of this remake or the original but i decide to take the risk and buy the DVD just for BBT and Napoleon Dynamite or Jon Heder.The film is about Roger (Jon Heder) who is having a real bad time in his life: he is fired of his job in a gym, in his other job as a cop he is nothing but a joke to the delinquents and to his partners, he can't have the girl of his dreams and every time he is near to her he suffers panic attacks. Tired of all that he decide to join the secret class of Dr. P. (Billy Bob Thornton) where he and his right hand Lesher (Michael Clarke Duncan) gives unique lessons of behavior to losers like Roger but soon Dr. P. is going to compete with Roger for the girl of Roger's dreams, Amanda (Jacinda Barrett).I found this film as a very funny and entertaining remake with a lot of great lines. I haven't watch the original (i'm going to find it) so i can't compare them but i can say that the idea of this class is as funny as cruel specially with a teacher like Dr. P. that is played in a good way by BBT. Another similar character of his recent works in "Bad Santa" and "Bad News Bears". And well, Jon Heder is nothing but fun in this minor work after the total memorable Napoleon Dynamite. The rest of the cast is nothing special with the beautiful Jacinda Barrett, a cameo of Ben Stiler and a little performance of Luis Guzman.Conclusion: i like this film, is a perfect way to spend 1 &amp; 1/2 hour with your friends. So prepare some popcorn and enjoy this nice comedy. And by the way, Wolfmother's "Dimension" really rocks! 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just rented this movie last night. My girlfriend talked me into it. She had seen it in the theater a while back and claimed that it was really good. I gave in with little expectations. It was better than I thought it would be and it was actually pretty funny in parts. John Heder does a good job, it's probably one of his better films. Billy Bob Thornton does a good job playing the guy you want to slap. The movie did however, get kind of annoying in parts and I found myself getting a little frustrated. It felt like the movie wasn't going to come to a conclusion, but it finally came to a good ending after all of the scenes where I wanted to pull my hair out of my head.

		<shortDescription>Great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was really good. I will be honest, I watch all of Billy Bob Thornton's movies, good or bad, because I always know it will be interesting, funny on occasion, and always have a heartwarming feel to it.This was the best of the lot so far, although personally I didn't find it funny, but then again, being a person who would have went to the "school for scoundrels" I took the movie quite seriously.Next to Billy Bob is the guy who played Napoleon Dynamite, and (in my opinion) he gave an Oscar winning performance, I was very impressed with him so much I actually applauded at the end, and am writing a review about it.This movie was excellent, it could have been so many things, but as long as you don't go in expecting to see titanic or Forrest gump, you won't go away feeling hard done to.I am trying not to spoil the story for anyone, because it is a good story, and personally (as a movie lover) I prefer to read reviews without spoilers.The movie is 2 hours of pure and utter excellence, I only give it 9 because it is lacking in comedy in my opinion, and I would have given it an 8/10, but as far as I can remember, Billy Bob wasn't playing a drunk, which gives it a boost, because he as well as the other guy (who I can't remember the name of as yet, but I certainly will be a fan after this movie) gave a top class performance.See this movie, you won't regret the 2 hours it takes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Napoleon Dynamite fans get a very large amount of that actor in this film- which could be a selling point for some people- for me it was more of a- let's see what you can do different situation and there wasn't a lot that was different in his character other than that he was less interesting, and less funny this time around.Billy Bob's character is film flam, without enough visual details to encourage character development- he's a bullshit artist so him TALKING about himself is of no use- we never really get to know this character...I think in order for this film to be funny it had to be a lot darker and tell the truth, as in be a lot a meaner- about women in brutal detail. However- that wouldn't sell with the chickees in the audience- about 23% of them- so they probably market-tested their way out of a really good film here.PLOT: geeks get trained by billy bob to be less of wimp and more of a man hence becoming more attractive to women- there are a couple of good scenes- but only a couple. If you are a fan of both of these actors- a six pack is recommended for full enjoyment...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious Romantic Comedy about a Man chasing the Girl of his Dreams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger (Jon Heder, Napoleon Dynamite), a "geek" with little self-confidence, is desperately in love with Amanda (Jacinda Barrett, Ladder 49), a British grad-student who lives in his apartment building. To overcome his lack of self-esteem, he signs up for a course taught by Dr. P (Billy-Bob Thornton, Friday Night Lights), an aggressive macho-man. After Roger finally develops a sense of personal pride, Dr. P begins pursuing Amanda as well.I saw this movie on a date a little less than a year ago. It was a feel-good comedy, and it was all about the "average man", and the movie has the strong message that any man can get any woman (similar to Hitch). Jon Heder was hysterical in this, as was Thornton. I laughed so hard during this movie, and continued to root for Roger until the very end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>School for Scoundrels seems undecided whether it wants to be a (yawn) conventional romantic comedy, or a quirky offbeat indie picture more typical of its stars Jon Heyder and Billy Bob Thornton. The presence of Sarah Silverman in the cast made me expect more of the latter, but alas, she is as underused in this plot as she was in School of Rock - a few biting moments, but not enough screen time. Jacinda Barrett is ornamental as the obvious love interest, but sleep walks through the part. There is no explanation of her motivations for behaviour that leaps over hugely improbable plot gaps (none atypical of the rom com genre. Billy Bob is consistently restrained but over the top at once - more Bad Santa than Astronaut Farmer. Heyder seems misused, misdirected or miscast. Having outgrown the high school roles, he seems uncertain whether he is Tom Hanks boyish leading man, or Mathew Broderick's adolescent twit in an adult body.There are enough plot twists to keep the movie vaguely amusing, but it never grows wings and soars above the ordinary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie! I Loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had wanted to see this film because I am a fan of the two lead actors, Billy Bob Thornton and Jon Heder. And I had heard that it was a really funny movie. It had to be funny! The thought of tough guy Billy Bob teaching a self respect class is a funny premise anyway. And Jon Heder, the nice, quiet guy being taught by Billy Bob just adds to the comedy. And, being a fan of Napoleon Dynamite and Blades of Glory, I had to see Jon Heder in this film. And needless to say I was not disappointed in the least. It was as every bit as funny as I had hoped. But it also had some drama mixed in with it that I had not expected. But the drama worked in this film. And I was pleased. So basically the plot involves a loser meter-maid named Roger, played by Heder, who is nervous and prone to panic attacks and passes out when he tries to speak to a girl he has a crush on named Amanda, played by Jacinda Barrett, who lives down the hall from him in their apartment building. One day Roger's friend Dave, played by David Cross, tells him about this class that he took to help him build up his self confidence and get girls. So Roger takes Dave's advice and pays for the class and attends. It is taught by Dr. P, played wonderfully by Billy Bob Thornton and his assistant Lescher, played by Michael Clark Duncan. Dr. P teaches Roger and his classmates to take what they want, initiate confrontations, how to speak to girls and how to become the hunter and not the hunted. Which is one of the funniest parts of the film. It involves the guys chasing after each other and shooting each other with paint ball guns! And poor Roger gets hit in the crotch three times at close range! That had me rolling on the floor. And at the end of that scene Roger sneaks up behind Lescher and shoots him. And Dr. P praises Roger for that and Roger starts feeling better about himself. But then Dave tells Roger that Dr. P does not like to be outdone. He is the best at everything and he always will be. And after Roger is told that he catches Dr. P talking to Amanda, the girl that Roger likes. And once Roger realizes that Dr. P is trying to outdo him, they become rivals and start doing things to each other to see who is the best. That involves the funniest scene in the move where Roger, Dr. P, Amanda, and Amanda's witchy friend Becky, played by Sarah Silverman, playing tennis. Every time Roger serves the ball the ends up hitting Dr. P somewhere on his body. It is so funny. Had me in stitches! So then Roger is on a mission to find out what exactly is Dr. P's deal and what his background is. Then that is where the drama unfolds.School For Scoundrels isn't the greatest movie ever made, but it's definitely fun to watch. If you liked Anger Management, as I did, you will probably enjoy this one. Fans of Jon Heder or Billy Bob Thornton will enjoy their performances in this film as well. Ben Stiller, Horatio Sanz, and Matt Walsh all have funny supporting roles as members of Dr. P's class. The only thing that annoyed me about this film was Sarah Silverman's character. Boy was she annoying! I know she was supposed to be that way but after about the third time she got in the way of Roger's plans you just wanted her to go away. But this film is a wonderful mixture of comedy and drama and I was not disappointed. I loved it. Thanks for reading my review!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie wasn't good, not at all... But it wasn't that bad either... I like John Heder, I thought he was pretty good in Napoleon Dynamite, playing the ultimate loser. But then I saw The Benchwarmers and Just Like Heaven, and I thought to myself: Man, this is a one-trick-pony... He needs to progress, a lot! But in School for Scoundrels, I saw that with the right co-actor (Thornton) and a half-decent director (Phillips) it was possible to squeeze a decent (and i mean decent, not good) performance out of him. The story was predictable, but judging on by this movie, Heder could have a future in the movie-industry as a versatile actor. Don't get me wrong, he's not that great, but he could evolve, like Sandler or Carrey. Anyways, happy to see he can do more than play a complete loser.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roger (Jon Heder) is a extremely shy, scared young man with occasionally has panic attacks. When his friend (David Cross) recommends him to go in a school specialized for confidence for Roger. When he decides to take the course, he meets the mysterious teacher (Oscar-Winner:Billy Bob Thornton). Which he gives Roger much cock-sureness but when the teacher decides to steal Roger's dream girl (Jacinda Barrett) away from him, It's war between Roger and his teacher but Roger decides to dig if there's any dirt on his obscure instructor.Directed by Todd Philips (Old School, Road Trip, Starsky and Hutch) made an amusing comedy, which is based loosely on the 1960 British film of the same name. Thornton and Heder are good in the movie, it is light-hearted and it has some big laughs. Since i am reviewing the Unrated DVD, which in this version has vulgar language added back in.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an amusing commentary by the co-writer/director and co-writer:Scot Armstrong, alternate ending, outtakes and more. This movie was a box office disappointment but it will surely do well on DVD. Despite it's flaws. It is worth a look. Super 35. (*** ?/*****).</fullReview>

He enrolls in a top-secret confidence building class taught by Dr. P.(Billy Bob Thornton)and soon enters a competition to woo Amanda(Jacinda Barrett), who recently befriended the beleaguered Roger. The rivalry spins completely out of control and the pranks that ensue are assumed to be the comical hight-lights of the film. I thought I didn't like the movie, because I just don't like Heder.

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: School for Scoundrels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So you're a pushover, lack guts to go after the one you love, and rely on stacks of self-help books to tide you over your pathetic life. Wake up! Genuine help is on the way! Be a lion! Get what you want! Welcome to the School for Scoundrels!OK, I think I sounded a little too enthusiastic for this movie, but that's basically the premise of this remake. Yes, it's another remake from Hollywood, and it's no surprise that this one just coasts along on material that seem a little uninspiring and with a premise only all too familiar - the usual loser needs lessons to hook up with hot babe story, with a twist.Jon Heder (Napoleon Dynamite, The Benchwarmers) stars as Roger, who's a complete loser in a dead end job, relies on books to instruct him on life's lessons, and has the hots for his neighbour, Amanda (Jacinda Barrett, last seen in The Last Kiss). However, being innately shy, he lacked the guts to pursue her, until he signs up for an ultra secret course called the School for Scoundrels, led by Dr P (Billy Bob Thornton) and burly henchmen Lesher (Michael Clarke Duncan).Naturally, the crux of the jokes are from the lessons derived from Dr P's unorthodox teaching methods, for these shy students to graduate into slick operators, and there are a few genuine laugh out loud moments (like the reference on the babies). However, most of the jokes relied on sexual innuendoes and slapstick, which have been tried and tested before, coming across as familiar rather than ground breaking funny. If you have seen a lot of comedies of such nature, then you'll find it difficult to have your funny bone genuinely tickled.Directed by Todd Phillips, who also helmed comedies like Road Trip and Starsky &amp; Hutch, despite its shortcomings on the laughter front, I thought it was relatively well paced, with drama, comedy and enough tension rolled into one. You'll more or less guess the outcome of the story, but trust me, I did get fooled, well, almost. Jon Heder, as always, is effective as the Loser, while Billy Bob Thornton probably lived up to his real life notoriety in this role as the teacher up to no good.School for Scoundrels worked by using a sprinkling of gems along the way, so pay attention to that little dig on Angelina Jolie, and that appearance by Ben Stiller. Yes, that's him! But no, even having probably Hollywood's #1 funny man of the moment, failed to lift this movie from mediocrity and familiarity.</fullReview>

I went to see it with my friend and film producer and he definitely had a good laugh about it. Well, I wouldn't say for sure that I recommended this film because as I'm concerned it is way too typical for a person with intellect. Comedy films really suck, especially with their "breifly romantic" moods and "new and improved" cinematography. If you're looking for a break and want to go with Flemming's words that people only watch movies to relax, then check out this movie for it is filled with outrageous comedic twists, stupid comedy, and a man accidentally getting his nuts zapped. BUT if you want a darker and much more complex film that reflects on reality and makes you actually think, then pass on School for Scoundrels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the sequel to Napoleon Dynamite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this film an IMDb 6 (the equivalent of ***) for one reason and one reason only: Jon Heder.Don't get me wrong, I love Billy Bob too, but he's lame in this movie; his character is pathetically written, and he does the best he can with wretched material, but this is NOT Bad Santa. No, this is an inferior retread of a different movie, and it ain't Napoleon Dynamite, which everyone keeps referring to. It ain't that film OR that character, mainly because (1) ND was a far superior movie, and (2) Heder's character in this movie has far more edge (more like the Scorpio he actually is). I think Heder's a genius, really, which of course Billy Bob is too, make no mistake - I did see Sling Blade and the aforementioned Bad Santa - but in this context, it's Heder who comes out ahead because (1) his character was better written, and (2) the camera plain loves this guy; no matter what he's doing he comes off sympathetic and credible. I believe eventually he should play a serial killer and he would prove this beyond all doubt.</fullReview>

I liked Billy Bob Thorton in "Bad News Bears" and "Bad Santa" and hoped that this movie would be like one of those. It's not. Unlike Billy Bob's other film's, in this one, he has no one to work with. Micheal Clark Duncan comes off flat and Ben Stiller's cameo is weak and pointless. I think the biggest problem I had with the film was John Heder. I didn't like him in "Napolean Dynamite" and I mildly liked him in "The Benchwarmers". He's just to bland. You can't relate to him and he doesn't steal any scenes like the main character should. The story is the same old story with a mild twist at the end. The producers weak attempts at jokes fall flat and the acting is so sub par is bad.

I won't say that I wish I hadn't bothered, because I'm of the opinion that any film is worth seeing, but "School For Scoundrels" is truly rubbish, terrible and not very good. Lame is also good word.Not funny enough. Not nasty enough. Not pacy enough. Way too polite and amiable. Where was the farce and the violence and the pain? Billy Bob Thornton sleepwalks his way through his part, and that is a shame because he could have been great, and we know that with the right material Jon Heder can be incredibly funny. Such a shame. What were they playing at? It should have been better.According to IMDb "School For Scoundrels" was inspired by the 1960 movie "School for Scoundrels or How to Win Without Actually Cheating!". Don't believe a word of it. Practically the only elements they took from the original was the title and a comedy tennis match. If only they had remade that movie, which is a little British gem.

		<shortDescription>John Heder is awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie did have me laughing out loud. John Heder is one of the best "acting" dorks in the movies today. While I am not a Billy Bob Thorton fan he was good in this movie also. All of the "losers" that played in this one, they were cast with a good eye. They were all believable. I do agree with the PG-13 rating due to the language in this movie. I wish someone would make a really good movie without all the cussing. It isn't needed. Ben Stiller was hilarious as usual playing the part of the crazy hermit. But John Heder stole the show as the nerdy guy trying to win the girl. He is destined for the big times I think, because he is so funny, seemingly without trying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the fault of the advertising</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be honest, I enjoyed this movie immensely, twice in two days, actually. In fact, the second time I watched it, it was in a small den with 14 or so people. In an attempt to find the group behind one the songs ("Set Me Free" by The Kinks), I came on IMDb like I usually do. However, I was amazed when I saw the reviews. I was expecting a 7, or a 6 at least, but a 5!? I was surprised, but I'll never push a movie on someone. I looked at some of the comments and saw what I severely dislike. Comments saying that the movie wasn't as good as the original and comments saying that it was barely funny. It's sad when people criticize a movie for not being as good as the original (such as when it happened with Dawn of the Dead). The fact is, they have to change the movie or it isn't a remake, and for the last time, they couldn't use the original actors because Ian Carmichael is in his late eighties and Terry Thomas is dead. There are far too many people who think that they can't appreciate both films, or that by spouting off the alternate name of the original and saying that the original is twenty times better makes them great. I've seen the original, and I don't prefer it. I found it reminded me of My Fair Lady (that's not a good thing), although I thought My Fair Lady was at least tolerable. But then, whether you like the remake or not, the original will always be there. The second problem resulted from advertising to the wrong crowd (such as with Girl Next Door). John Heder tried to make the jump to a semi-dramatic role, which people weren't expecting at this point, that coupled with the fact that the commercials made it seem like an average 'Go in, Laugh, Leave' movie, the entire crowd was people expecting a non stop laugher. Billy Bob Thornton didn't impress me in this one, which surprised me more as he was mentioned first in the credits. He seemed to try harder during some scenes, which could just be a result of having to pretend to be lying. Even still, it just didn't feel right, although, he did a fairly good job overall. John Heder has shown he can do more than just comedy now, hopefully leading to more roles such as this one. Many are saying it's the worst movie ever, but I have one thing to say, no movie is worse than Airplane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About 20 minutes of humor and heaven knows what you call the rest of this movie. Sadly disappointing. I sat down thinking, "Bad Santa", "Bad News Bears" and now this? Then the previews came on &amp; he's in another movie where he is the nasty ex-gym teacher who now married a students mother and he acts the same. I always thought he was a fine actor, but don't understand where he is going.As far as this train wreck - what the heck was the rape talk all about? All I can figure is a they thought a Ben Stiller walk on would save it. But, to be fair, the funny parts were pretty funny, but few &amp; far between. Billy Bob needs to find a script where he can show his talents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>School for Scoundrels is a movie about a group of men who sign up for a class in order to improve their self-esteem and motivate their lives. Taking lessons from a crafted Professor, each student increases their ability to succeed in life and enjoy it. Featuring Jon Heder, we knew there were going to be many stupid funny moments. I was surprised at how professional he was in this movie.I thought that Billy Bob Thornton was excellent. He really portrayed his role well as the professor and showed us his leadership side. All the thought processes he had to go through in the movie show intellectuality and poise as a teacher. Truly a good job I thought on his part.Shown as a comedy, School for Scoundrels was much less what I anticipated. Not terribly funny, but mildly entertaining. The plot was well thought out and run, especially towards the end. The relationship between the three main characters made the movie. Overall, it was an okay film, but I wish there was more... don't we all?5/10. Fun to watch, but I'd wait until it is broadcast on TV. Save your money for blockbusters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poor Jon Heder. It must be hard to find decent roles now that he's known as Napoleon Dynamite to anyone who knows his name. But seriously Heder, why did you accept this script? I'm sorry to say it Heder, but "Gosh! You're such an IDIOT!" Alright, forget the fact that the plot is a direct rip-off of the much funnier Anger Management. Forget the fact that Billy Bob Thornton unsuccessfully reprises his Bad Santa character minus the excessive drinking and f****ng. Forget the fact that the film makes traumatic rape memories a running gag. The fact of the matter is that the film just isn't funny. Seriously, how did it fail? How do you cast Billy Bob Thornton as a complete asshole and Jon Heder as a hapless loser - the parts that these two were born to play - and fail to make it hilarious? How does Thornton + Heder + Luis Guzman + David Cross + Michael Clarke Duncan + Ben Stiller add up to a film which is just so... NOT FUNNY? It simply doesn't make sense to my tired brain.I guess it could be because the script is so incoherent not even Kubrick could've made a decent movie out of it. It has very few funny jokes and it barely knows what it wants to be. Comedy or drama? Romance or thriller? A heartwarming, intelligent comedy masterpiece or a lazy cash-in on Thornton's popularity? Well, I think you know the answer to that last one.The film's pacing is way off; as the film rushes to its conclusion (a plot twist even the kid from Bad Santa could've seen coming a mile away) it feels like we've only watched half a movie. The lack of any real laughs, an engaging plot, the rehashed characters, it all makes for an utterly unsatisfactory comedy which isn't worthy of Billy Bob Thornton.Much like this review, School for Scoundrels is lame and a waste of time. Don't see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a renter. There were some funny scenes, mostly all of them shown in the long theatrical trailer, which basically gave away most of the story. The dude from Napolean Dynamite played the identical character from that movie; maybe he's not acting. He was still very funny, and Billy Bob was good as well. Ben Stiller had a small part, and his character was moderately funny.I had high expectations for this movie. They didn't crash, but fell short. I liked 40-Year-Old Virgin much better.

Thorton steps into yet another cynical and callous role. Barrett is cute but unconvincing. The script is awful. The humor is lacking. Even Sara Silverman, one of my favorite comedians, was struggling to provide laughs with the terrible lines she was delivering.

		<fullReview>It's like Anger Management meets Gilligan. Silly physical humour mixed with Billy Bob's deviousness...well, it's beyond funny. We had low expectations of this movie because I didn't like Napolean Dynamite (I'll have to try it again now that I like the leading character), and my husband doesn't like Billy Bob. We rented it because we'd run out of movies to watch. I'm certainly glad we did. Billy Bob has a couple of funny lines but the "losers" of the "School for Scoundrels" get most of the laughs. The romance is incidental, not annoying--something to focus the plot. I rarely rate a movie a 10 (especially comedies!) but the enjoyment level was so high, I had to. My husband and I both held our sides and roared throughout the entire movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I missed this in theaters, but rented it through Netflix and surprisingly enjoyed it. I then bought the DVD.One thing about the movie was the character's shyness and awkwardness, something I can totally relate to. Even though I'm a woman, I feel I identified with the character very well. I always like it when I see a film character I can identify with, even though the plot elements are a bit far-fetched, such the paintball gun shooting (with no protection) and the confrontation initiation. I thought the girl was very beautiful, in an enviable way. I've never seen "Anger Managemnt," but may just add it to my Netflix cue after seeing this movie. I always try to find similar movies when I find one I particular enjoy. The Netflix page for "School for Scoundrels" said it was enjoyed by member who enjoyed "You, Me and Dupree," another film form last year that I really loved. Perhaps that was how I unexpectedly enjoyed "School for Scoundrels." I recommend "School for Scoudrels."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes!!! Finally A Movie Worth Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was absolutely great! I loved it! It was funny, entertaining, and allowed for every emotion to felt at some period from beginning to end.The cast is great, could not have been better! Jon Heder's character was great and Jon played a more serious role for a change. His role was probably the biggest and most refreshing change as far as casting. It was so different from Napoleon Dynamite and Blades of Glory! He truly done a great job, showing that he can do anything in the way of acting. I would like to see him play something serious like a detective or something funny, such as a: hippie, stoner type character. He could do it! Bill Bob, well...He is always great and lets face it, Billy Bob as a scoundrel, a cant miss! He totally nails it by the way and allows for some surprises, laughter, and the "shock" factor. He plays a lier, a manipulator, a cheat, and a scum bag. All in one movie...So him! Heratio Sanz, who plays a weakling who is abused by his wife. Then after the class, leaves his abusive wife for a verbally abusive woman (Sara Silverman). Heratio is one of my favorite actor's...Loved everything he done on Saturday Night Live and Boat Trip! Sara Silverman, the bitchy room-mate who seeks and craves attention. She is so good at playing these parts and she plays this one great. Job well done! Michael Clark Duncan playing the tough guy was great. One of my favorite scenes was when he got shot between the eyes by Jon Heder and the other was when he had to play Cindy for the class. (Him in a blonde wig was hilarious!) Lastly, Ben Stiller as a crazy, demented, "cat-man" psycho seeking revenge was great. No one else could have played that part any better!However, the whole time I was watching it, I was thinking, this is going to be just like Anger Management. At times, it was very close. Then boom, the end, where Billy Bob is really trying to steal Jon's woman and whisk her away. Totally unexpected...was a great twist...It had me on the edge of my chair, cussing Billy Bob, biting my fingers, and pitying Jon Heder's character! WOW! If you are looking for a great, entertaining, and suspenseful comedy...This is it! It is definitely an entertainment filled 2 hour movie worth watching a couple of times! Thanks for a great, refreshing movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jon Heder is Roger, who signs up to take a class for losers taught by Billy Bob Thorton in this genuinely funny and charming screwball comedy.The story is simple enough and follows the same old formula but still engaging and offers some genuinely funny and smart moments. Jon Heder is good at playing the likable loser who still wears pajamas to bed and gets tongue tied around girls while Billy Bon Thorton fits perfectly in the cynical "mean guy" role. Supporting roles from Jacinda Barret, Micheal Clarke Duncan and Sarah Silverman as well as the sweet and innocent nature of Jon Heder's character keep the movie from getting too bland. I would have liked to see a bit more of an ending to wrap things up.Overall this movie was funny and enjoyable and worth renting if you missed it in theaters or are looking for a decent comedy.</fullReview>

Even Sarah Silverman as Amanda's cranky roommate was well cast for the part. Billy Bob Thornton must have had his part written just for him, as he excelled at it.The scene which I most enjoyed was the dinner date between Roger and Amanda. It reminded me of my first date with my husband, We got drunk, and he kissed me in almost the same manner as Roger did. Like Amanda, I ended up putting him to bed then going home (and I also lived in the same building). (I was really hoping that Roger and Amanda would have gone for it, since they were in Roger's bedroom..oh well)I found this movie reminded me of a lot of things, which is why I gave it a 10. It was a very warm and funny story.I'm buying this when it comes out on DVD. Awesome movie!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was an OK movie. Every time I see Jon Heder I think "Gonna eat your tots ?" or "I had an excellent time". To see him in a love story just seems strange. He seems to play the same guy in every movie. Down on his luck, insecure, shy and loves a woman he can't talk to. Sarah Silverman plays probably the worst person in the world. If she was real people would kill her or beat her. Ben Stiller is wasted (not drunk but not used to his abilities), in fact Ben Stiller could have had Jon Heder's part and it would have been the same movie. Billy Bob is not really in this movie. Maybe if he had been the Sling Blade guy it would have been hilarious. "MMHmm, you like fried taters with your woman ?'His character is just there. I have no idea what Micheal Duncan Clarke is doing in this movie. He plays a tough guy who isn't very tough. The whole airplane scene is pretty good. Probably the best part of the movie.

The story where a loser tries to save his love from the hands of the master manipulator is truly funny. The way the student beats the master at his own game is worth watching and every laugh. The scenes between Roger (Jon Heder) and Eli, Diego are funny. The first scene where Jon confronts two dudes for a parking ticket is very hilarious. Micheal Clarke Duncan is funny in parts and sometimes doesn't evoke any emotion. Ben Stiller makes a small cameo appearance and is funny. Jacinda Barrett looks beautiful and acts well.

If you've seen the trailers on television you've seen the most humorous parts of the movie; I might add that this is usually the case but never so true as in School For Scoundrels.

		<shortDescription>School for Scoundrels equal to the 1960 British original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>School for Scoundrels (2006) with Billy Bob Thornton as as Doctor "P," which starred Alistair Sim (1900-1976) in the role of Mr. S. Potter. Ian Carmichael (1920-) was the original Henry Palfrey, played now by Jon Heder. Terry-Thomas (1911-1990) was Raymond Delauney, this time played by Scot Armstrong. It is said that writer-director Todd Phillips asked for Billy Bob Thorton for the part of the manipulative Dr.P, an instructor at the Learning Annex, A perfect foil was needed for Scot Anderson and Billy Bob Thornton; Billy Bob was considered the "anti-Christ," so they needed an actor who was 180 degrees different, that is when Jon Heder was brought into the picture, he comes across and naive and very nice. There are similarities in both the old film and the newer one; this one mixed broad comedic sequences with loads of heart. The actors were allowed to improvise while on the set. There was a diagram more or less to follow, but as they wanted the actors to be funny, they were asked to be a little more organic about their approach. It is a farce about one of life's losers who enrolled in a school that taught "one-upmanship." Of course it is a secret class taught after hours by a very suave untrustworthy character, Dr.P! He says he can turn mouse-like men into roaring tigers. As in the original where Henry Palfrey (Ian Carmichael) woes April Smith (Janette Scott 1938), Roger (Jon Heder) woes his secret love too! The entire film is funny and keeps you laughing from start to finish and you'll want to buy a DVD of it when they hit the market! Sarge Booker of Tujunga, California</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Halfway through watching this mediocre comedy I had to remind myself that Todd Phillips was the director. That's right, the director who gave us "Road Trip," "Old School," and "Starsky and Hutch" (all very funny movies) gave us this dull piece of fluff. Is it an awful movie? Far from it. But at least terrible movies stick in your mind. "School for Scoundrels" is your typical lame PG-13 comedy filled with typical PG-13 gags. Though "Starsky and Hutch" was a PG-13 movie, it still had an edge. This movie has no edge. Worse off, Jon Heder is a weak leading man. There's no denying that he was good in "Napoleon Dynamite," but judging from his performances in this movie and "The Benchwarmers," he should stick to playing Napoleon Dynamite for the rest of his career. With a cartoonish, over-the-top character like that, he pulls it off with flying colors. As far as playing an average Joe, he just comes off as boring. Heder possesses moderate acting ability, but has no charisma. I think Phillips cast him in the film simply to further cash in on his "Napoleon Dynamite" fame. Billy Bob Thornton never fails to please, but he isn't given much to do. So he just goes through the motions, delivering the standard I'm-just-here-for-my-paycheck performance. The same goes for Michael Clarke Duncan. If you get Duncan in a blonde wig and not draw out big laughs...I think that's a sign. Even Ben Stiller's cameo didn't make me laugh, though I can't exactly blame Stiller himself. Sarah Silverman delivers a few funny lines, but even she doesn't help much. She can't exactly showcase her trademark raunchy humor in a PG-13 movie. All in all, you're better off waiting until "School for Scoundrels" plays on cable (in case you're stuck at home and feeling extremely bored).</fullReview>

However, the trailer for the movie gives ABSOLUTELY no indication of how funny it is. I just don't get how they came up with a trailer like that. Ignore it please and go to see the film. And to the producers, hellllloooo it needs to be edited, try using the FUNNY parts of the film.The acting is great, the slapstick is great, and the jokes don't resort to cursing and/or bathroom comedy. A great comedy for all perceived "loser-types." Todd, you did a great job! Keep up the good work.Y</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lazy Writing Earns "School" a Failing Grade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 47 years, maybe it was time for a rip-off (er, remake) of the classic British comedy --- a film made at the peak of England's Golden Age of Comedy (Terry-Thomas, Dennis Price, Ian Carmichael, etc.). Updated and now set in New York, the new version was an instant box office strike-out while the original (1960) was a long running hit. In terms of raw box office data, the new one might have grossed more, since movies cost $11 in 2007 vs. $1 or less in 1960.The current movie had lots of potential, and I'm disposed to like most films with Billy Bob Thornton. BUT... but... all too often these days the writer can't be bothered with thinking up effective and clever dialog; so they slouch into endless "goddams" or "Jesus Christs" and now a few of these jerks think "Jesus f...ing Christ" is akin to the rebirth of Will Shakespiere. Actually, it was in 12th grade that I learned peppering one's speech with god-damns instantly pegs the speaker as a dunce and a loser. The writing in School for Scoundrels just sucks (to take a clue from their style of expression)."There's no sense in beating a dead horse," they say. Not true, McGee. Even though School for Scoundrels marks another box office tank-job for the Weinstein Company, isn't it time Hollywood woke up and stopped trying to peddle garbage the ticket-buyers do not want.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, the movie yes, started off pretty boring. Anyone who can sit there and call John Heder an intolerable actor is absolutely lame. He is by far the best comedic actor in his age group. He is full of good humor.Also, if you expect every movie to be freaking awesome with him in it then your wrong. That's whats wrong with America today, they can't adjust to change. By the way,the movie wasn't suppose to be based around Billy Bob Thorton either. It's about a guy who is lame and wants something more out of life, which would make John Heder the main character, duh. Of course the end was going to be predictable, but what ending in a movie isn't. You rarely get a movie that is unpredictable. I give John Heder, a new rising actor,Two thumbs up. He's only trying to adjust his image, so people won't always look at him as Napoleon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie looks funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this movie looks funny with Ben Stiller in it and a whole cast of characters. I believe this movie will be really big in the theatres, but I guess we will see depending on what happens you know. I have always enjoyed Ben Stiller movies they have a certain originality to then. Authenticity like Adam Sandler movies, with exception to his Mystery Men movie considering that it was a complete flop. The elements in this movie look well considered and ready to please. To bring it all together in the end that makes sense I believe. I wonder about the plot whether it will be well thought out or make sense. We will have to see when you guys go and see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely funny in most parts but can get confusing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the preview that was going on in theaters across the nation last night and I had a lot of mixed thoughts on the movie. The story is fairly simple and easy to understand. However, some parts of the movie may become confusing if you don't pay attention to the little details. Other than those little parts, the movie was overall hilarious. Some parts will get you out of your seat laughing and you won't be able to stop. The people in the theater were bursting with laughter at certain parts. However the movie is not all funny. Some parts become serious and emotional and when you find out what's really going on, you will probably even feel a tear in your eye as you get the really know the characters and what they want. This movie was great because it was funny, emotional, touching, and had an overall good message. See it when it comes out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Fight Club" for losers - disappointingly inert and unfunny comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SCHOOL FOR SCOUNDRELS (2006) * Jon Heder, Billy Bob Thornton, Jacinda Barrett, Matt Walsh, Horatio Sanz, Todd Louiso, Michael Clarke Duncan, Sarah Silverman, David Cross, Luis Guzman. (Cameo: Ben Stiller) Disappointingly flat and inert comedy about a loser (Heder) who enlists in a self-awareness class run by a sadist (Thornton) whose questionable methods lead him to believe he can overcome his short-comings by winning over his lovely neighbor (Barrett) until he finds out the good doctor has deigns on her himself. Woefully unfunny and too cruel to be kind methods make the viewer squirm instead of laugh. (Dir: Todd Phillips)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst comedy of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caught a sneak preview of School for Scoundrels last night and I really wish that I hadn't. I'm a huge fan of Todd Phillips work, up until last night I considered him the best comedy director working today. Road Trip, Old School, and Starsky &amp; Hutch are modern day classics as far as I'm concerned. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for School for Scoundrels, which can serve as a prime example as how not to make a comedy. This is Todd Phillips' fourth comedy and yet it felt like it was his first. The direction was flat as a pancake. The fun energy of Road Trip, Old School, and Starsky &amp; Hutch is completely missing here. The pacing and comedic timing is totally off in almost every scene, certainly not helped by the limited performance from star Jon Heder. Heder, actually okay in his post-Napoleon Dynamite role in this year's Benchwarmers, is completely miscast here. He has three facial expressions: goofy, attempted anger, and when he tries his hand at seriousness, it is a disaster. He has no chemistry with love interest Jacinda Barrett or Billy Bob Thornton. For someone to pair up with an actor of Billy Thornton's talents is asking a lot for anyone yet Heder doesn't have what it takes. I hate to rip on actors, especially Heder who really seems to be trying, but that's the problem, he's trying too hard. The rest of the cast is completely wasted. David Cross and Sarah Silverman, always great in their roles, have absolutely nothing to do much like the audience in the theater watching this catastrophe. Not recommended to anyone. Thornton fans will be especially disappointed considering this is his worst film. 0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie had me laughing the entire hour and 40 minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i would have given it a 12 out of 10 but that wasn't an option. I got to see this move early at a theater that had the full length sneak peek. I laughed so hard i was crying at points all of the cast worked so well together. It was one of the funnest movies that i have seen all year. from the one liners to the slapstick it all had me laughing. They tied up most of the lose ends which doesn't always happen in comedy movies these days. I think what i liked best is that a lot of main plot points couldn't be foreseen. I usually watch a movie and am able to guess what happens. Not in this movie. Thiswas just a well done comedy. YAY for Hollywood this one rocked!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than a movie with both Horatio Sanz and Jon Heder has any right to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's take a trip back in time, shall we? All the way back to August 29, 2006 when I unveiled my wildly hilarious and alarmingly accurate Weinstein Company Fall/Winter Preview. If you'll recall (and I'm sure y'all have my previews memorized), I was NOT looking forward to School for Scoundrels. For the sake of those who are too lazy to click on the link above, here are my initial assumptions:"Sigh. Do we really need more Jon Heder movies? Plus, how good can a movie with Horatio Sanz be? My guess - not very. Ah well, Billy Bob Thornton and David Cross are in it, so maybe it has potential. Let's check out the trailer...Huh. Is this supposed to be an unfunny 're-imagining' of Rushmore? That's certainly the vibe I'm getting. I think I laughed once, maybe twice during the trailer. Johnny's setting his expectations at LOW on this one. Can we sue the studio for including 'hilarious' in the synopsis and not delivering? FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!Or maybe this is one of those rare films that's keeping the jokes out of the trailer and saving them for the film. Oh wait; Jon Heder and Horatio Sanz are in this, never mind."Welp, let's examine my comments in light of the fact that I've now seen the film.* Horatio Sanz' role is small enough for him not to do any damage (except to any chairs he sat in during the filming).* Jon Heder still remains a one-trick circus act, and I pray I never see the guy in tighty whities again, but he's tolerable.* David Cross' role is basically nonexistent, but the rest of the supporting cast is very good and elevates this to a level that Heder couldn't have managed on his own. Jon Glaser (the curly-haired dude from Conan O'Brien) steals every scene he's in. The movie is worth at least a rental if for nothing else other than the line, "There's no doubt in my mind that you'll be murdered." It's all in Glaser's deadpan delivery.* Man, there's a whole lot of ugly in this movie. Juan Guzman, Horatio Sanz, Jon Heder, AND Billy Bob Thornton? They sure aren't given the ladies much enticement to see this, huh? This gives The Night Listener (Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Sandra Oh) strong competition for 2006's Ugliest Cast.* As predicted, Billy Bob's presence does indeed help the proceedings, especially with condemnations on self-help books such as, "You can't help yourself because your self sucks." Good point.* It does borrow the "teacher and student going after the same woman" theme found in Rushmore (and other films), but that's pretty much where the similarities end. I'm not telling you to run out and pay full price to see it because this certainly won't appeal to everybody and I don't want anybody ganging up on me for giving this a blanket recommendation, but I will admit that it's much better than a movie with both Horatio Sanz and Jon Heder has any right to be.There are some slow stretches, jokes that fall "Kate Moss flat," and the two leads fail to bring the movie's biggest laughs, but hey, there are laughs to be had, and that's good enough for me. If you're like many of the people who have told me, "I can't stand that Napoleon Dynamite dude" then it's probably best if you don't risk it.THE GISTSchool for Scoundrels doesn't demand to be seen on the big screen, but there are enough laughs to warrant a rental. If you insist on seeing it at the theater then make it a matinée, lower your expectations, and enjoy.</fullReview>
