		<shortDescription>Way, Way Better than I Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a surprisingly good, old fashioned ghost story.I haven't seen the original and I'm not a fanboy, so I didn't have any axes to grind going in. The cast is very good if somewhat underutilized, the photography and musical scoring are excellent, and there's a plot twist that caught me completely by surprise.Watching the previews you'd think this was the one millionth Asian horror with a vengeful female spirit who has long black hair and dark circles under her eyes. There's more than that going on here.And, without giving any plot points away, the final shot of the film is going to stay with me for a long, long time.Sure, this isn't the most original piece of work ever. It's part of a long tradition of ghost stories. But the makers had the sense to keep it to 85 minutes so it's over before you really begin to think how familiar some of the material is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mediocre Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In North America, after getting married, the photographer Benjamin Shaw (Joshua Jackson) and his wife Jane (Rachel Taylor) travel to Japan for a job opportunity with Ben's friends Bruno (David Denman) and Adam (John Hensley). While driving on a lonely road in Japan during the night, they have a car accident with Jane hitting a girl first and crashing a tree. When they awake, the police do not find any body and Ben believes that Jane imagined the situation. Later when Ben reveals his latest pictures, he finds some mysterious shadows, while the couple is systematically haunted by the ghost of the girl. Jane investigates and finds that the victim was Ben's former shy and weird girlfriend Megumi Tanaka (Megumi Okina), who worked as translator for Ben. Later Jane discloses deep and hidden secrets about the relationship of Megumi, Ben and his friends Bruno and Adam.The American version of "Shutter" is a mediocre remake of a great Asian horror movie. Actually it is ridiculous, with the author poorly using the same storyline and transforming a creepy and dark story in another Hollywoodian standard of silliness ? shallow screenplay but with beautiful actresses, handsome lead actor and wonderful locations in Japan. If the viewer has never seen the original "Shutter" (2004) (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0440803/), watch it instead. If the viewer has already seen the Thailand's movie, prefer watching it again. It will be better than wasting time watching this terrible remake. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): "Imagens do Além" ("Images from Beyond")Note: On 25 February 2012, I saw this film again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PERFECT! for our image of American youth...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie shows exactly how Hollywood sees America's youth. Compelled by fashionably dressed model women, sometimes half naked, bright colors, spooky images and scenes that are only there to make you jump. Oh... and I forgot, no brains. They think you're all idiots so they give you this cliché garbage.Skinny attractive woman who couldn't act if it were cursed on her, walks around always looking fresh and dumb in designer clothes. This movie is about as intelligent as a log. Everything seems forced and none of it is original or done in a compelling way. I have to wonder if English was the native language of the director since most of the dialog is unacceptably terrible. Many times I cringed or laughed at things that I knew weren't meant to have that kind of reaction.Poorly paced, poorly written, poorly acted, the effects are okay. I haven't seen the original, but conceptually, this movie could have been great if it were done the right way. Unfortunately, it was not. F-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of a good Thai horror movie that was released back in 2004. I really enjoyed the original movie and I recommend it to everyone. Why did they need to do a remake of a movie that was released only 4 years ago? Did they think they can improve it in some way? Not only did they not improve it, they made it worse than the original in many ways. The brilliant music and sounds from the original are gone, the ghost is less scary, is shown more often, and it seems less menacing (at one step the ghost is even singing!), the acting is worse, and the characters are less believable than in the original.The producers introduced a few new elements hoping to make the movie more scary, but in fact they made it more disgusting (the flies for example). The original movie was full of clichés, but this one is even more so. The most brilliant part of the original movie was the ending. In the remake, they simply copied every scene from the last part of the movie, but with less talent and less impressive results.So, I return to my original question: why did they need to do a remake? What was the problem with the original movie released only 4 years before this one? The fact that the main actors were Asians and that they didn't speak English? Or more likely, the fact that Hollywood, which is apparently all out of ideas, couldn't let a good story fly by them without them making money out of it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this movie, I was shocked by the comments. The movie wasn't that bad at all. In the beginning I wasn't sure what to think. It was rather scary, and the plot itself made my question whether I saw this movie or not already. It reminded me of similar movies like the grudge.But let's face it, the end was surprising and not in any way predictable.I like the movie. I'll see it again someday. I gave it a six because it was very entertaining, surprising, but it wont go into history as a masterpiece.See this movie if you want to enjoy yourself, be scared, be excited and you wont regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Remake, But...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I reviewed this American remake of a highly regarded Thai horror film from 2004, I ordered a copy of the original to make a comparison.Although the original is superior, the remake, to be fair smooths out some of the inconsistencies of the tale. This is not always a good thing as it's these little things that give the story a bit of character and individuality.To be brief, the story involves the haunting of an American photographer and his new wife in Japan after hitting a young woman with their car on a lonely country road.Most of the ghostly horror is more suggested than overt, with images appearing in photographs and just out of direct sight. Most of the set pieces from the original are here, but several of the most startling and effective moments of horror are missing. The unfortunate PG-13 rating keeps everything in check, so, while compelling, the horror is fairly muted. Another fault is the ghost lacks a bit of the personality the original has in spades. The final twist takes the story in a very different direction and is quite startling. But, like another reviewer wrote, leaves you feeling justice has been done.Not a great film, but very watchable and satisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another unrelentingly boring ghost-in-the-machine remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take it as it is. A derivative, leaden, mind-numbingly simplified remake of a superior original. That's not to say that it's genuinely decent on its own merits if you've not already seen 2004's seminal Thai-horror "Shutter" that reignited that country's interest in producing slow burning, luxuriously made horror films. Interestingly, and perhaps even fittingly, the Hollywood machine that devours and regurgitates the recent slate of J-Horror films has turned its sights on "Shutter", which arguably finds its core roots in Japan's horror conventions in its vengeful, waifish ghost girl tormenting the living by manifesting through various electronic mediums. So what Masayuki Ochiai's adaptation essentially becomes is a carbon copy of copy.American photographer Ben Shaw (Joshua Jackson) and his blonde schoolteacher bride Jane (Rachael Taylor) go straight from nuptials to a working honeymoon in Japan, natch, because America just isn't as scary to Americans as Asia is. Before heading off to Ben's lucrative assignment in Tokyo, the newly minted couple heads to a remote countryside inn when a brief accident derails Jane's constitution and compels her to seek out answers led by a phantasmal presence in photographs and a newly discovered knowledge of spirit photography.Unremarkably, Luke Dawson's screenplay omits and appends details to its basic premise. The original uses the stark disassociation of city living to intensify the eeriness of isolation, and the idea that we never really see what we think we know. Dawson's script transplants the couple to a different country, ramping up the cultural alienation and exoticism of another culture. It's not dissimilar to what we've already seen in "The Grudge" remakes.Even as Ochiai's direction is comparatively surefooted and patient with the camera choosing to hang on to a scene instead of ludicrously harping on jump-cuts and eyeball-rattling shots that bounce off the wall, the film feels unambitiously stale. "Shutter" goes through the motions of dourly checking off look-behind-you set pieces and reflections on windows. The plotting and performances are so apparent; you'd find yourself a couple of steps ahead of the film's central faux-mystery. While the bizarre symbiotic relationship audiences have with particularly mediocre remakes of Asian horror films should still live on after this, what remains most terrifying is how textbook simple and undemanding the film-making has become for films of its ilk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What really pains me is this movie does absolutely no justice to the original version. Watch the original Thai version. It is MUCH better in terms of plot, pace, suspense and horror. Instead of relying on the cheap, predictable *suspenseful music-BANG* Hollywood ploys very evident in this version, the original Thai version is very well built up, takes its time to set the mood and let the suspense and horror just seep in, and they also manage to throw in a bit of black humour as well (the public toilet visit late at night - classic). The background and development of characters in the original is MUCH better, and more plausible (with a more plausible explanation for why she turns up in photos - not this "spirit photography" crap), not to mention the acting is infinitely superior in the original.Hollywood fails once again. Skip this stupid knock-off and just go straight to the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why do i do it? I keep complaining about these Asian remakes yet i keep watching them . Maybe i do it so you don't have to , maybe it's because I'm sadistic or maybe I'm just waiting for there to be one that's any good? Whatever the reason one thing that i know is true is that Shutter is worst i have seen yet. For photographer Ben and his new wife Jane , his new assignment -- a lucrative fashion shoot in Tokyo -- was supposed to be a kind of working honeymoon. Ben and Jane arrive in Japan. But as they make their way on a mountain road leading to Mt. Fuji, their new life together comes to, literally, a crashing halt. Their car smashes into a woman standing in the middle of the road, who has materialised out of nowhere. Upon regaining consciousness after the accident, but they cannot find any trace of the girl . Shaken by the accident and by the girl's disappearance, they arrive in Tokyo, where Ben begins his glamorous assignment. Having worked in Japan before and fluent in the language, Ben is comfortable there, and he eagerly reunites with old friends and colleagues. Jane feels very much like a stranger in a strange land as she makes tentative, unsettling forays through the city. Ben, meanwhile, has discovered mysterious white blurs , evocative of a human form , that have materialised on an entire day's work from the expensive photo shoot. Jane's concerns escalate as she believes the blurs in Ben's photos are the dead girl from the road, who is now seeking vengeance for them leaving her to die... Without watching Shutter you already know the format. Spirits that have pasty faces and fail to recognise the value of the slogan "rest in peace. Shutter is also another "ghost in the machine" story, except this time the machine is a camera.The trouble is there is absolutely nothing scary about this movie . There is plenty of bangs and crashes and you are bombarded with noise but nothing at all visual that would remotely send a chill down the spine. There is one scene that i liked where the screen went black every few seconds as to imitate the flash of a camera but that is all i cant think of that i can say is good about this film.The acting is irrelevant because the film is so dull . Fans of The American Office and Heroes might recognise a couple of the cast.This is the first Asian remake i have seen that hails from from Thailand but it is still the same old dross that has been dished up over the last couple of years . Director Masayuki Ochiai has failed miserably to achieve anything worth while and it's a film that will fade from the memory very fast indeed.The PG-13 rating says it all, while opening the gates to bored teenagers it will turn hardcore horror aficionados in the other direction.I don't know about you but i want my Horror movies to be 18 rated and nothing less.3 out of 10</fullReview>

Same look, same style, etc. I think the writers overseas are better but the production in America is better. More than frightening me, it left me a little sad. You feel sorry for the character, you don't particularly fear her. And his wife's reaction to the secret photos was pretty extreme...you would certainly be alarmed and unnerved, but somehow I don't think you'd have such a visceral reaction. They made it seem like someone had torn off her face or something.I did like knowing why the Japanese nurse kept weighing him though...pretty clever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shutter was a pretty decent movie. The movie was pretty predictable. People will probably not like this movie because of the ending. The thing that people need to realize is that when they are going to see a movie like this you know what you are going to get out of it. I hate it when people keep cutting down movies like this, such as One Missed Call and The Eye. In these kind of movies the ending is pretty predictable, its pretty much going to leave you hanging. Thats why I think people need to understand you can't hate a movie because of the ending. I thought that their was so much more to the story than just spirit photography. It explains why its happening to the people that are on their honey moon. It seems like in these kind of movies the story explains a lot more near the end. They kept doing many flash backs in this movie as well. That's when they were explaining the story a lot. This was actually pretty creepy, freightning, and scary all at the same time. It had a ton of sudden pop out right at your face scenes. Im sure that when you see this you will jump many times. I thought that it could have been a little bit better. I liked the idea of having it be two newly married couples that this spirit photography is happening to. I liked how the wife was fighting the ghosts the whole movie. The acting was surprisingly really good I thought. The wife in this played by Rachael Taylor did such a great job playing all the scared parts and emotional parts. Her husband played by Joshua Jackson did a great job as well. Some of the visuals were pretty sweet. They had a lot of nice camera shots of the whole city in Tokyo. After some of the people left the theater I heard them say I want my money back. This movie was trying to prove to you that making fun of people and treating them like crap at a younger age will come back to haunt you. Overall this was a decent movie with some good scares. I would go see this at the cheap show or only pay five dollars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was HORRIBLE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The attempt for this movie was a valiant one... but it failed none the less. They tried so hard to sum up J-Horror movies into one movie that didn't scare you, leave you in suspense, or even guessing. At one point I asked my girlfriend to wake me up when it got good. Had I actually gone to sleep and had her wake me up when it was good... she would've woken me up at the credits. The cinematography was great, but that was probably the only good thing about the movie. You see a side to Japan most movies don't show you, NOT the hustle and bustle of Tokyo, but the side parks, the small houses outside the main cities, the apartments, etc. The movie left nothing to the imagination, you knew what was happening the entire time. There was no point in the movie where I was scared... I didn't even jump. All in all this movie was terrible, don't waste your money on it, watch something else instead... like moss growing, ANYTHING but this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imitation is Limitation. Wake up Hollywood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hmm, the lead characters are like Barbie and Ken. How much more ridiculous can it get?! Hollywood's obsessive love affair with making remakes of successful Asian horror films has given many chilling treats like 'The Ring' and 'The Grudge'. But nowadays, more and more disappointing and mediocre films are being made. Unfortunately 'Shutter' is one of the more disappointing ones I have seen. This film didn't scare me, didn't hold my interest for the most part, save the scenes after the false climax. Few days back I had defended 'One Missed Call' (actually that was more creepy than this), but now I will not take this film's side. Directed by Masayuki Ochai this is a remake of a Japanese and Thai film. Know how much parents think before showing their young ones a horror film? Don't think about it on this one, just let them watch it. They will have seen so many photos on T-shirts more scarier than the ghostly elements in this movie, even they will probably get bored. (I have even forgot that ghost girl's name!) Ben (Joshua Jackson) and Jane (Rachael Taylor) are newlyweds who excitedly head to Tokyo where Ben has a prestigious fashion photography assignment. However that excitement soon turns to dread as the couple is haunted by the ghost of a girl who appears in all of their photographs, and Jane had actually crashed her car into this spirit girl some time back. Jane is curious as to who the girl might be and her bizarre attachment to them, but Ben is more cynical at the beginning. Jane discovers some shattering truths that can change her life forever.This was coming on TV the other day and the opening sequence looked cool, so I watched it. It has some formulic horror genre elements: a Japanese ghost girl who is vengeful, black haired (and possibly anorexic!!), a subdued color setting and set design which imitates The Ring, a very happy couple. I was just waiting for the spirit to seek revenge and right all the wrongs inflicted upon her. Now that would be a good thing for me, if not for the laborious screenplay which doesn't take the plot forward and has no clever twists. Even little children won't be scared by this film, it was more like a drama to me. Performances are bland throughout, except for Jane, but she didn't have any other work other than clicking photographs. What other things did she do? Never explained, but Rachael did try her best and was pushing herself, I will give her credit for that. If the director had just focused on her rather than Joshua who still hasn't evolved from his Dawson Creek (I like that TV show by the way) level of acting, this would have been better. His friends are simply awful, they are caricatures and highly superficial. In terms of content, originality, characterization or emotional journey, this film didn't give me anything, at least it should have given me some chills. So, don't waste your time on 'Shutter', instead go and see 'The Ring' again.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Shutter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone remind me what's the point of a remake again? A dearth of ideas? Thinking that one can do the job better? Don't laugh but one of the better Asian horror I've seen (probably amongst the first few too in recent years) was the Thai movie Shutter, which played on the plot device of spirit photography, those strange streaks of blurs that cover weird angles in a photograph, and with a vivid imagination, you can even make out faces of people you know, or know not.There are remakes which challenge on the technical fronts - having to recreate scenes shot by shot, or those helmed by master directors in the hopes of injecting some depth into characterization and story. Some filmmakers even choose to remake their own films with a different cast (Funny Games anyone?), and the list goes on. But one thing's for sure, I seriously hope that the number of Asian horror remakes start to dwindle, given that the westernized versions pale in comparison to their Asian originals, and Shutter happens to be one of them.OK, so perhaps half the fun was eliminated when you know just about every plot twist and turn, character motivation, and probably even what dialogue will come out of the actor's mouths (so I jest). But in all earnestness, I reckon that this remake will appeal more to those who have not seen the original. It's easy to be thoroughly bored because you know just what's about to come, and can eliminate red herrings, as well as spot the now-so-obviously subtle hints that the characters try to hide unsuccessfully.Also, you can bet your last dollar that Hollywood will again go over the top in trying to explain everything verbatim, as well as attempting to up the ante with the finale, but in doing so, tried too hard. I do not deny that it was much needed tension too little too late toward the end, but really, it added nothing to the plot besides succeeding in making you squirm. Technically this remade version boasts nicer production values, but lacked the edginess that the original had to offer, well, because the directing duo of Banjong Pisanthanakun and Parkpoom Wongpoom were rookies then, and lacked certain horrific charm and soul (pardon the pun). In fact, there was one critical scene which the Thai version had which boasted some ingenuity in a tracking shot, but one which the remake had chickened out to do, opting instead for cheap CG and unnecessary cut-shots.So the remade had blinked first, and didn't offer any really frightening moments to genuinely scare. Somehow I thought it was rather subtly pre-occupied with sex, given that you have a great looking cast with Joshua Jackson as Benjamin Shaw the photographer, and his newly wedded wife Jane Shaw, played by Rachael Taylor. For some reason, Japan gets automatically associated with Asian horror, and that's where this remake was set in, maybe because the director - Masayuki Ochiai - is Japanese too.But the final straw which I found really disturbing, was the lack of acknowledgement that this is a remake. There's nothing in the opening credits to inform the audience that it is one (the original Thai directors given only producers credits), and probably tried to pass off as an original story. Recommended of course to those who have not seen the original (even then I'd suggest you only watch the Thai version). Those who have, are advised to steer clear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original movie is brilliant: Starts like a typical 'scary movie', and suddenly it turns to be an excellent 'love drama' with one of the best endings i have seen in an movie like this,,, But, again, the studios bought the script, adapt it, and put someone who, technically can make a good version,,, the director make a decent work portraying the Japanese society(in a very mediocre way in the end,,,not bad: mediocre... a Japanese girl jumping to the arms of a man? bad bad bad),,, Why Japan and not Tailand? Who knows (we know, but I can't be so rude), in the end is irrelevant, but at the beginning its kinda strange,,, The story starts almost the same as the original,,, and 30 seconds later changes completely,,, the original plot of a man fighting the 'ghosts' of his past, is changed by the plot of a woman fighting with the 'jelous and dead' ex-girlfriend,,, near the end of the film he screams 'he left you because he doesn't love you!!!',,, that's ridiculous,,, the end remains almost equal to the original,,, but it feels terribly empty: the original presents three people(live and dead) destined to have a shared destiny for the mistakes of one man,,, this remake shows a man receiving his lesson because he is a jerk,,, so disappointing,,, I tell you: Go, buy the original Shutter, watch it, enjoy it,,, stay away from this,,, thing,,, remake,,, whatever you call it,,, don't tell is good because you didn't see the original,,, even if you don't watch it, don't make this movie good,,,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to start with this...Everything about this film is telegraphed; I can tell before the actors do anything what's about to happen and roughly how they'll react. While being predictable isn't necessarily a bad thing this movie already has strikes against it for being a remake of a Japanese movie that just doesn't translate well...like most Japanese horror movies.Don't get me wrong, I understand the plot and why the ghost is haunting him and all of that...it isn't complicated, it's just stupid. Ben's friends raping Megumi to get her out of his life is so far out there that the person who wrote it needs help from a competent therapist; or they should at least make an effort to study human behavior rather than cobble together a weak-ass plot out of a few poorly thought out ideas and then write in actions to justify the events of the film as an afterthought. None of the characters, besides Jane, behave in ways that make sense or in ways that a normal human would. I know, I know, this is supposed to be the result of a terribly tragic event that created psychic ripples or whatever but it's just not plausible. Sorry, I just need more than what this movie's story offered.The events in this movie could have been believable if the three characters who were involved in the abuse of the dead girl had at some point during the film been exposed, at least a little, as being somewhat sinister. I think the writer/director/whomever MIGHT have TRIED to convey this but unfortunately did so in such a poor manner that what the three of them did just didn't make sense; based on the characters and how they were presented and how they behaved throughout the film I just couldn't see them traumatizing that poor girl. The filmmakers should have attempted to show some private side of these three, shown that while they were adept at appearing normal they were in fact the real monsters, made even more monstrous by their ability to seem so normal.But no, instead we are presented with an implausible scenario perpetrated by people who, given examples of who they are as presented in the film, are acting so incongruous to their presented natures as to render suspension of disbelief nearly impossible. A good horror film should be immersive, persuasive even, and Shutter's lack of that, which is due to its disjointed story, is the final nail in the proverbial coffin.If, however, you have particularly low standards when it comes to entertainment and can be easily taken in by cheap camera tricks (that have been done before (and better)); if you can overlook bland, mediocre acting; if you don't mind "scary" content that is so cliqued that it's no longer even remotely disturbing...then you might like this movie. For those of you out there who, like me, want more than pretty pictures and a hackneyed plot for 90 minutes...look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take a Ghost-Picture, it'll last longer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately I didn't manage to catch the 2004 Thai original before this American remake premiered at the annual Belgian Horror and Fantasy Festival. I didn't bother to see it when it initially got released because there already was an overload of Asian Ghost movies at that time and I really couldn't cope enduring another dull and scare-free imitation of "Ringu". After seeing the US remake I'm definitely interested in checking out the original sooner or later. The basic idea of restless spirits trying to communicate through photography is remotely original, but the elaboration (at least in this remake) remains somewhat tedious and predictable. Immediately after their marriage, Jane follows her photographer husband Ben to Tokyo where his friends arranged a splendid job for him. Jane, but soon after also Ben, suffers from visions of a deceased girl and all the pictures they make are ruined by ghostly images of this same girl. There's more than obviously a link between this girl and Ben's past days as a bachelor, but Jane only gradually learns the truth of what happened exactly. To my knowledge, this is the first and so far only Thai film to be remade by a Japanese director but with American funds and cast members. Talk about an international co-production! Masayuki Ochiai previously directed the incredibly atmospheric and uncanny hospital-horror film "Infection", so he definitely knows how to build up suspense and terror through suggestion. The main problem here is that the ghostly subject matter is too "soft" and doesn't lend itself to provide some genuine shock-moments. We've all seen too many (Asian) horror movies already in which white-faced spirits spontaneously appear &amp; disappear again, and the mystery is always build up towards a point where the script can't possibly fulfill the audience's anticipations anymore. In "Shutter", you rather quickly figure out that Ben knows than he tells, so you can easily guess each and every plot twist far in advance. There are a very limited number of sets and exterior locations. Why didn't the film take advantage of the wondrous city of Tokyo, like for example "Lost in Translation" did? Rachael Taylor is certainly a promising actress with a lot of growing potential, so I hope she'll get offered a couple of better screenplays in the near future. Thus far, she only has horror rubbish like "See No Evil" and "Man-Thing" on her repertoire and those things won't get her noticed. Neither will "Shutter", for that matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>go watch Ring remake for a fifth time. you will thank me...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have signed up just to say how much US shutter sucked. I haven't seen the Thai version, but considering the high recommendations for it, i thought US version would be able to carry out the level of Ring in some sense anyway. My bad... Acting, script, special FXs, score, there s nothing to defend. Casting sucks too. Ghost is actually cute. Supposedly womanizer friends of Joshua Jackson just look like 2 dorks. The accident, Jane taking a final glance on the ghost before passing out, all are beyond ridiculous. Spare the lack of general continuity, there s no suspense building up. Feel for your 1,5 hours. If you are still persistent about watching a far-east horror remake, u are about to see one of the worst.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoiler Warning*So my friend and I went to go see this movie on opening night, and we were HIGHLY disappointed by the end of it.Pretty much, it was as if someone mixed most of The Grudge and some of The Ring together, and added in a camera. PRESTO, a cheap horror movie ripoff!Here are a list of Parallels or Similarities between this movie and the Grudge and the Ring.Both - Person(s) who are dead, wanting revenge. Grudge - A man jumps off a balcony killing himself. Both - Hallucinations/Seeing Thingsie.Grudge - Ended with character in metal hospital, with the spirit nearby. (Grudge: Sarah Michelle Gellar's character, Shutter: Ben w/ Megumi on his shoulders.) Both - Female character investigates. Grudge - Occurs mainly in Japan Grudge - Person(s) that are dead, of Japanese origin. Ring - Bodies of the spirits found Ring - Occurrences don't stop after a "proper funeral/burial" had taken place as expectedAnyways, here's a quick rundown of the movie.Ben and Jane get married. Honeymoon cut short due to job opportunity in Tokyo, Japan. Both go there. While driving in a forested area, they run into a "seemingly alive" woman, literally. Car crashes, and both knocked unconscious. By the time they come to, the woman is missing, and they call the authorities but nothing turns up. From then on, all the photos Ben takes seem to have "Spirits" in them, which eventually mess up one of the photo shoots he was doing for his job. Also from that incident, they both start having hallucinations and rundowns with this "spirit". Eventually they both investigate together (after Jane herself has done by herself already) and find Megumi (the dead woman) dead in her house outside of Tokyo as a skeleton. Proper funeral occurs after a night where Ben and Jane both nearly die from her, and they expect everything to be fine; moving back to America. After that Jane discovers that her husband tortured Megumi in a way, and then Jane came to a conclusion that Megumi was trying to warn her about the kind of man he was, and leaves him. Ben then tries killing himself and ends up in a mental institution.If the story had a more original twist to it, it would have been a much better film. The suspense scenes were more comical then frightening (The spirit was randomly sitting down brushing her hair making a "Grudge-ish" sound, frightening Ben), and random women screaming didn't help the movie in any way.However, the acting in the movie was pretty good, so I can't fully hate the movie.Overall 3/10. I only suggest seeing it if you are trying desperately for a good laugh, or if you are completely bored into insanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just no good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this movie was just not very good. although i did enjoy some of the acting at times there was just not really any real plot. it straight out just didn't make sense. the only time you could see her was when you take a picture of her. what? OK OK maybe that isn't that bad but yeah the big question in my mind was the mans injury after his car accident. if he wasn't having the pains from the girl on his shoulders before the accident then his neck/shoulder pain wasn't from the girl. so how does that make sense? i also thought the ending was rapped up really quick at the end. they could have given hints about what they did to the girl it just doesn't add up to me. i also didn't really understand why it never showed up in any of his pictures before. And the scale at the doctors? what????? one you think that he'd have realized it by then. and two aren't ghosts supposed to to be weightless? i don't know i would have just liked the movie to maybe build up more and not just try to be scary. i think it had good potential when it started but when the job started in japan i think it seemed to go from plot to let us try to scare you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Not The Ring but it still is a delicious scare!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as I'm concerned The Ring (remake--and the original really) is the scariest film I've ever seen. It just downright creeped me out and ever since then I've been all for the barrage of Japanese remakes that Hollywood has churned out even if some of them haven't been great. The Grudge was okay, most recently Jessica Alba's The Eye (see my reviews) and there have been not so great sequels and remakes as well from the Japanese or Asian films but I knew Shutter looked good and I'm so glad I checked it out because I think this is one of the top ones from the genre that they've done since the grudge. The entire film just has this eerie quality about it and even though it does have some cheap thrillers, scares, loud noises, it also really tries to get under your skin which I love about these types of films when you just get that eerie chill down your spine and Shutter does that. It deals with all the paranormal and eerie aspects of a haunting ghost story and even throws in a killer twist to boot although perhaps a little predictable I think you do see it coming but it doesn't make the film any less watchable. I happen to think Shutter is a downright brilliant horror thriller.I really like Joshua Jackson, and even during Dawson's Creek I thought he had potential and for the first time I think he really shows his adult acting chops in Shutter. He's a great lead in the film and you can almost let go his teenage persona from his younger years. I think this will really open up some doors for him because he's great at it. I would love to see him come back for a sequel if they ever did one. Beautiful Rachael Taylor is Jackson's newlywed wife Jane. She is probably even more the main character getting even more screen time which is nice because she is EASY and then some to look at. Despite her near picture perfect appearance she still has a very down to earth quality and you follow the mystery with her much the way you did with Naomi Watts in The Ring. She does a great job and her and Jackson are hot together and very believable. Together they make a terrific combo and add to the already great feel of the film. Megumi Okina plays the haunting gal from beyond the grave. She is appropriately eerie and adds even more human qualities to the seeming monster killer so that it feels even more real. David Denman, and John Hensley play small roles as Jackson's best friends and they both do a decent job in those roles although are kind of overshadowed by the stand out performances by Jackson and Taylor.Korean Director Masayuki Ochiai makes his American debut and he obviously has a clear grip on suspense and an intriguing story in any language. He does a really great job at the overall ambiance of the film and uses stereotypical but nonetheless terrifying settings like the abandoned buildings, and images in pictures and such. The film just will make you creep with the feeling that you're being watched through a camera nonetheless. Shutter lives up to it's name by really making the camera the focal point of this mystery and how to solve it. The story is really interesting and even though I had my suspicions of how the mystery would end it didn't make it any less enjoyable. I wouldn't say that Shutter is gory or really brutal although it does have it's moments but it really does go for the thrills and any great fan of this genre of film will LOVE Shutter. I think it's just awesome!! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Date Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cliché. Agreed. I knew pretty much what the ending would be about 20mins into it. But, there really is no such thing as an original movie anymore. Whatever it is it's been done. The only thing they can do now is get a better actor or more special effects. You don't go to a horror movie for a thought provoking story line, you go to get scared or grossed out, or to get REALLY close to your date. The movie accomplishes this, unless you are one of these people that walk through haunted houses and roll your eyes no matter what they throw at you. If you are then go get a job in Kosovo because that's about the only way you are going to get scared.I liked it and the ending was fitting. There's some good jumps and they manage to pull off ultra creepy without the jerky photography so commonly used in ghost stories now. One thing though: **spoiler**I also noticed a few comments as to why there was such a fuss about the pictures Jane finds in Ben's forgotten pictures. Ummm...lets see..he took pictures of the poor crazy girl while his two best friends raped her. There were more than 3 pictures. He didn't just mistreat her; he used her to make snuff pictures which is usually why you have vengeful female spirits. Again, cliché, but how many reasons are there to come back and terrify someone really?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie expecting it to be good... It turned out that it is one of the worst movies ever, and I got so bored that I started text messaging to make the time go by. The story line is miserable and it moved so slowly with nothing scary happening at all. The only scary thing is when the a sharp object goes in the one guy's eyeball and blood goes everywhere. This looks totally fake though! The whole movie you have no idea why this chick is trying to kill these people, and in the end, they seem to throw together an explanation for why she did it (the only interesting part of the whole movie). I was bored out of my mind, not scared, and I laughed more than I screamed. Maybe a viable comedy, but definitely not a horror movie at all! Plus, the images with the people are so obviously photoshopped and the people get so scared over the lamest stuff that it is pathetic! I could complain for hours, but you can understand what I'm getting at.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A protracted (even at 85 minutes), unimaginative ghost/revenge movie whose belabored ending makes a viewer weary... long after they've decided any money spent on it (by producers or viewers) is just too depressing to contemplate. God almighty, how do film companies keep finding the money to make this crappy movie? Any thought, emotion or innovation is pushed off screen to make room for a) a non-scary ghost who needs closure, b) atmosphere instead of horror, c) derivative commerical film-making in place of authenticity, d) sexual teasing instead of content, and ho-hum, d) people seeing blood on their reflection in a mirror which disappears after they rub their eyes, g) ghosts who disappear over an edit, and h) bugs that can be seen moving under people's skin, and last and very least, i) loud noise/jump scares in place of more refined fright. I would dance a little jig if all of these devices were retired, and all the directors who use them, lined up and shot.I don't think it's possible for a movie to find a less interesting path than Shutter. I just don't care about this movie or the hacks who made it. Kill it before it can reproduce.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like this movie. The photo imaging subplot is great. One notices the grainy quality which foreshadows a oncoming storm. The lighting is always dark, which gave me a feeling of dread which adds to the script. Always signs of sexual tension with the fashion industry characters. The three elements create a perfect storm of a women scorn. All 3 males act as if they have a wild secret. When the storm hits by the vengeful spirit the story theme about what comes around does go around is revealed. I like the surprise ending when obsession never ends and a broken heart begins. Be careful what one does there is always human feelings. 7 out of 10 A good mystery. A good date night movie. My friend Dax though run of the mill, but I like the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film deals about a supernatural palish spirit threatening a happy marriage. After celebrating their wedding party at USA , young couple goes to Japan for working. There the young photographer Benjamin Shaw (Joshua Jackson) and his recent wife Jane (Rachael Taylor) have a car crash on the road and hitting a rare girl who flees. Then Benjamin reveals his latest photographs and discover mysterious shadows. As they investigate the phenomenon, asking for help an expert (James Kyson Lee, Heroes) and a medium . As they find other pictures contain similar supernatural images, that Benjamin's best friends (David Denman, John Hensley) are being haunted as well, and Jane discovers that her husband has not told her everything. It soon becomes clear that you can not escape your past.Then a vengeful specter (Megumi) kills everybody go into their haunted house and Jane attempts to get the bottom of the mystery. A series of terrible and mysterious deaths occur, as one friend commits suicide dropping himself from a high apartment while the creepy spirit possesses its victims.This frightening movie displays terror, shocks, hard-edged drama and creepy images. While the look is suitable atmospheric and eerie, the argument stretches plausibility to the breaking point. This is an acceptable Japanese adaptation of the novel and movie that took successfully Thailand. Nice and colorful cinematography filmed in Japan by the cameraman Katsumi . Suspenseful and mysterious musical score fitting perfectly to terror by Nathan Barr. The motion picture is professionally directed by Masayuki Ochiai in similar style to Hideo Nakata movies -The ring, Dark Water-. The director Masayuki(Infection, Dark tales, Hypnosis) is an expert on horror cinema and follows the wake of Japanese eerie phantoms of pale complexion and long hair as ¨The grudge¨ and several others. Rating : Acceptable and passable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good remake with a lot to like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following a gruesome car accident, a newlywed couple in Japan believe that the female victim of the accident has returned as a ghost and seeking retribution against him for a previous incident against her and forcing them to find a way to stop the rampage.This wasn't at all that bad if looked at on it's own as it's actually a rather good entry. One of the best features is that there's just a literal ton of encounters with the ghost, and all of them are handled well enough to earn some great moments. From the first dark-room encounter where he finally becomes convinced of the presence of the ghost, the encounter with the ghost in the boardroom which is another stand-out due to the fantastic innovation of the Polaroid camera allowing for some suspense to be had with the waiting for the photo results to come about, and the interaction that happens once the revelation has occurred is really good, and the later attack alone in the apartment with only the flashing camera to provide any light in brief spurts, the sounds of what's going on making it so fun and creepy that works so well due to being quite long and intense, which makes it stand-out a little more than the quick-shot appearances throughout the beginning. Those quick-cut scenes are also are pretty good, with their being a fantastic collection of banging noises off in the distance, ailing cries throughout the house and different pop-ups everywhere, from a great appearance on a train that results in a fun freak-out to a really creepy scene with the ghost appearing in photos all across the apartment, these are all quite fun and really worthwhile. As well, there's an incredibly fun and enjoyable encounter late in the film through an attack at the house, which has a lot of good points about it, from the creepy ghost action to the great setting and what it signifies for what has happened so far, it's a great scene and really makes a great lasting impression. Even the early car accident here with the ghost appearing in the middle of the road and causing a severe accident comes across as really nice here, being a nice shock jump and done early in the film as well. The last plus is the conversation at the magazine, which is quite fun spilling the basis for the film's mystery and getting it all out in the open with the discussion of what's going on, it makes for some really good times and the photographs along the edges aren't that bad at all. These here all work to make this one quite enjoyable. There oddly wasn't a whole lot really wrong with this one. One of the biggest issues is a lame encounter in a friend's apartment late in the film being way too short for what it was intended to do. This here just doesn't really do much, and just really has a feel to it that makes it come off like so many other efforts in the genre. Of course, the camera angles used here are another factor, as they hide everything during the scene and really making it hard to figure out what's happening. Another small problem is the finale in America, which just feels tacked on and unnecessary as the story had ended nicely in Japan and really didn't have to come back to America for the final twist at all. The last flaw is that the revelation comes way too late to really mean what it could've, and since it's based on a mystery that just comes out of nowhere without really being developed well, making that twist highly unorthodox. Overall, though, this wasn't that bad at all.Rated PG-13: Violence, some Language and sounds of Rape.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a ghost story is good, it can be REALLY good, like "The Innocents", "The Haunting," or even "The Uninvited." The shocks are judiciously placed and the eerie atmosphere builds. Others seem to fall apart, like "Ghost Story".This ghost story isn't so hot. It begins with an apparent accident and it's revealed that the victim, a young girl, is haunting the couple in the lethal car. But, actually, that's not the reason at all. The REAL reason the young lady is haunting the couple is that the husband had an affair with her, blew her off, and now she's getting revenge.These spirits or ghosts or whatever they are seem to be all around us because they show up in some photographs as white blurs. Sometimes their ectoplasm is realized and they stick their tongues down your throat so you drown in your own blood. Sometimes, in the ectoplasmic present, they just sit around in the distance and sulk.The acting here is okay, no more than that. And the direction includes a lot of cheap shots. The women in the piece, Rachel Taylor, an uber-Aryan, pauses trembling before a door. Her hand reaches towards the doorknob. And with a loud BANG on the sound track, the door is jarred open and an ordinary chatting couple pass through from the opposite side. No opportunity for a cheap thrill is passed by. There is the rotten skeletal corpse from "Psycho," the spoiled photographs from "The Omen," and multiple surprises accompanied by stings on the sound track.The photography of Tokyo is magnificent, though, crisp, with colors drawn from the cool end of the spectrum, so that when a scarlet kimono shows up, it's a bigger shock than the hand reaching in from off screen and touching somebody's shoulder.Nice location shooting, yes, and Tokyo is so CLEAN for a monster city. Yet there's nothing much new here, so move along.</fullReview>

While driving on a deserted road, she runs into a woman. Both Ben and Jane pass out in the crash. Upon waking, nobody could find the woman. However they start to be haunted by her. A spirit shows up in their photographs and they are hounded by her.It's a horror based on a Thai original that is inspired by Japanese horrors. With photography going digital, this one is on the verge of being obsolete. It's a rather bland horror and not a scary one. There is no new visual ideas in this. I do like the Japanese locations which is made into a cold foreign place. There is something obvious about the final twist although the particulars have some bite. Overall, the movie isn't interesting for too long and never gets that compelling anyways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Decent American Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a section of people that will more than likely put this American remake of the original Thai movie down purely BECAUSE it's an American remake, which is ridiculous in all honesty. There are plenty of remakes of Asian horror that have still been as enjoyable as the originals and it's actually quite sad people will not like the remake purely because it's an American version. If you go into this version with an open mind, even after seeing the original, then you should still quite enjoy it.This one sticks pretty close to the original in storyline as well, which is a good thing because with it being a remake you sometimes kind of expect them to change things around, and end up ruining it but they don't. The ironic thing is with that though, is if you've seen the original then you know what to expect at the end so it kind of takes that surprise element away slightly.Anyway, this one felt like it was a bit slower for the first half of the movie that what the original did, but thankfully it picks up enough within the last 30 minutes or so to make up for that. The story unravels nicely enough as it goes along, keeping your interest peaked to keep you watching until the very end with a decent amount of tension &amp; suspense, which again gets better as the film goes on. There are also some nice creepy moments here and there and while none of them will seriously freak you out, they do enough just to make you feel that wee bit uncomfortable.The cast are OK and they do a decent enough job, but there's just something about Joshua Jackson that is out of place with his role of Ben. It's not that he does a bad job with the part, but I do feel that someone else might have done a better job. Then again it could have been worse...they could have got the emotionless Mark Wahlberg in instead.Overall, while this won't go down as being one of the best horrors of all time, it's still a very decent movie. Ignore any of the hate you read about it and judge for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American remakes of Asian horror films have mostly struggled to win grace and favour with horror fans. Shutter is no exception, it has been met with the usual howls of derision, claims of it being pointless, losing the horror essence of the original and etc. But what for someone like me who hasn't seen the original?I found Shutter to be much like how I found The Ring, the Naomi Watts starrer from 2002, a very effective chiller with a solid mystery to be unravelled at the core. The ghost is creepy ? as are the various photographic links, the scares handled professionally by the makers, and the finale pays off with a startlingly chilling revelation that freaked me out; and I'm a middle aged man!It's far from perfect, the pace is a bit haphazard, logic goes out the window often, and cast performances are only adequate in the absence of "A" list stars to propel the story onwards. While it's tough to hang your hat on the two principal players since the emotional empathy hasn't been earned by them, courtesy of the writing. Yet with no frame of reference to raise expectation levels ? or down them as well, this is a safe and sturdy spooker that does its job well enough. 7/10</fullReview>

The original was a Thai movie, but for some reason this is set in Japan, but really that's the least of its problems. Storywise this is a decent idea and I'm guessing the original perhaps worked out better, but this is largely overly tame, and for a movie not even 90 mins long it feels very plodding at times, and rather directionless. The two leads are dull characters played by dull performances, and there's a cheap TV movie feel, not to mention some very cheap jump scares and seen it all before "spooky" ghost women.

		<fullReview>A tale of misery and betrayal witnessed in manifolds; A woman agonized by some men returns for revenge and claims the lives that took hers. The film offers several instances that are riveting and startling enough to make you shudder at times, especially teens I guess as most of the people in my theater hall were young adults and cringing. Definitely not those who are more than familiar with predictable Horror sequences and adult audiences who squint their eyes at the thump of abrupt background din, which seems to have become mandatory in chilling scenes these days. But the way the film is presented makes you yawn sporadically a couple of times, or maybe it was just my short 6 hour night nap. None of the deaths are meticulous enough to demand positive reviews, except the climax with Joshua Jackson, in which he doesn't die but becomes deranged. Overall a good performance by Rachel Taylor, but still not sufficient to provide the film an edge-of-the-seat fright tag. Could have been made better. Could have been skipped. 5 out of 10.

It mostly keeps to the original storyline, and while some suspense is lost, it is still enjoyable.The acting is a little over the top though. The original Thai actors are able to convey fear and disgust almost effortlessly, but the American version seems to need its stars to over-emote to convey the same feelings.The surprise reveal at the end however, is still preserved, thank goodness.(Sorry if I keep comparing versions, but since I usually watch the original versions first, I can't help comparing the Hollywood versions to the ones I watched earlier.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American photographer and his sweet wife (Joshua Jackson and Rachael Taylor) find a new home in Tokyo thanks to a friend of theirs (David Denman) who sets them up in a building to both live and work, but they encounter a lingering, pestering spirit. This Onry&#x14d; could very well have a reason for showing up (and ruining) Jackson's photographic sessions with models in/outdoors, as well as, constantly turning up to haunt them. It seems Jackson and Denman (and also their mutual friend, played by John Hensley) eventually recognize exactly who this spirit is and why she is hanging around to remind them of past sins. Formulaic, dull plotting (the sheen had then worn off the allure of American remakes of Asian horror so popular in the late 90s/early 2000s by 2008), and a severe lack of imagination leave this remake dying on the screen without much to grab us. An image of why Jackson feels such a weight on his shoulders seems to be one of the few scenes (I also dug the scene where Taylor visits the magazine popular for showing (and creating, especially) spirit photography, and is shown a room with authentic photographs of specters on film) that leave an impression at all, but even it has been better executed before. You can just revisit (or watch for the first time) the Thai Shutter film and experience better creeps than what are available in this uninspired remake. One of the shining examples of how remaking past films over a period of time can numb the senses of horror fans, eventually draining our desire to even watch their Asian counterparts. The finale, where Jackson goes to great lengths to remove what is haunting him, is the death knell in this rather worthless remake. Taylor tries her best to encourage our sympathies for her difficult situation (not of her making; she's a victim of circumstance, unaware of what her husband done), but her character is basically reactionary, while Jackson bores with a performance and character that aren't able to rise above the material.

		<shortDescription>Quite good... but not scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SHUTTERI had never heard of this before, but i read the synopsis on the TV and it just sounded good.The movie is about a newly married couple who move to Japan. They have an accident and run over a girl, but they can't find a body when they regain consciousness. Then after that they start seeing her ghostly image in the photos that they take.For a psychological horror it wasn't scary. There were a few jump scares that were average. They made my girlfriend jump, but I unfortunately saw them coming a mile off. It is just a shame that this was not scary. But then I have never been scared by a horror. I wish I was... I think I would enjoy them more if I felt the fear. Instead I just find them entertaining.The film stars Joshua Jackson, Rachael Taylor &amp; Megumi Okina. The acting was alright... I liked the Megumi. She was spooky and intense.The effects were good... when she got run over it was gruesome and really well done. Also, there were some scenes later in the film where she starts haunting them where it was so well put together it didn't look too fake. I liked it.I will give this film 7 out of 10.It was good, but a little predictable. I would consider this more of a thriller rather than a horror.For more reviews, please check out my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen the original, so I can't compare the two films. From what I have read on this site, the remake is virtually the same to the original. My biggest complaint was that Megumi wasn't scary at all, she just looks like a normal girl, lets compare her to Kayako from The Grudge, Kayako looks frightening and her classic vocals will haunt you, but Magumi doesn't offer anything scary, all she wants to do is hang around Ben. The acting was bland, much like the script, but thats to be expected. I thought a film like this would have a great atmosphere, but no, they dropped the ball big time. And once again the ghost just wants revenge and then it's done, how's that scary, I prefer the idea of a ghost being a curse and will kill anyone it pleases, thats scary. I guess what happened to Magumi was somewhat disturbing, she was a timid girl and didn't deserve what she got. Now I would bet money that the original was the film I should have watched, because this one wreaks of being designed for American audiences. Give it a watch if you want, don't expect anything good though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Shutter' (2008)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I wanted to enjoy 'Shutter' and as intriguing as the premise was, this film just fails to deliver on so many levels. The writing is lackluster, and has clearly been written with haste and was obviously doctored by three or more people. The acting isn't terrible, Joshua Jackson has always been convincing, even in a sh**ty role, and John Hensley of 'Fifty Pills' fame is a nice added touch. Rachael Taylor is a beautiful new face to me, but she isn't really anything to brag about, and I feel like she was probably only given the role because of her similarities to Naomi Watts.No real scares to be had here at all, although I suppose if you were watching it alone late at night &amp; if you scare particularly easily, the film does give off a creepy vibe in the scene with James Kyson Lee at the spirit photography office. Although, I must admit, I would much rather skip this film and just watch the episode of 'Celebrity Ghost Stories' with James Kyson Lee in it, because that is actually scary and is actually real.SHUTTER -----5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tired remake, there's a surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of remakes, but I'll watch them out of interest if I see them on television (the main point being that I don't have to pay for the privilege). I absolutely loved the original Thai horror film, SHUTTER, and I thought that this film might be interesting because of the new setting (Japan) and the presence of a Japanese director to give it some Asian sensibility. Sadly, while the film does have some flashes of inspiration here and there, these are few and far between and for the most part it ploughs the same old tired and familiar furrows.DAWSON'S CREEK actor Joshua Jackson takes over the leading role, a newlywed photographer on assignment in Japan who brings along his unfeasibly pretty wife too. Of course, there's hidden tragedy in his past, relayed to us via some plot contrivances and coincidences, involving his ex-girlfriend Megumi (played by Megumi Okina, who gives the only decent performance in the whole movie). Every major set-piece already happened in SHUTTER, especially the excellent twist ending from that film, so I found this movie bereft of surprise, originality and inspiration.It's well shot, but it feels hollow. Jackson plays a bland, self-loving character who frankly bored me, and his wife just seemed dim. The scares are signposted far in advance, and the old schtick involving spirit photography was frankly tiresome. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more had it been a truly original movie, but like most remakes this one just seems to have no point in existing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spooky and atmospheric horror which is surprisingly quite good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shutter is a rather different remake than the usual Japanese to American horror, it has a pace which is just cracking, it's speeds along very fast but smoothly, one thing I dislike is when a film takes too long to get going and it lags but this movie doesn't waste any time in telling the story. American remakes of Asian film can either be really good or really bad, this is a good one, in lots of ways, the first being the excellent central performance by Rachael Taylor, Australia's newest up and comer. This film was made a few years and it was before I knew anything about Rachael Taylor but recently I have seen her in quite a bit of stuff and I have to say she has a great screen presence, she is wonderful in Shutter and pretty much everything else she's in.Josh Jackson is pretty standard as the boyfriend with a bit of a secret, I mean his role could have been played by anyone but yeah he's also pretty good. The story is a cool one which made me google spirit photography afterwards, when horror film come out they have to have something different about them, not enough of them do and they suffer because of it. The story unfolds in a mish mash of photos and horror images and the twists that come out towards the end are ones I didn't see coming.All in all I just found this movie to be far superior to so many others, it just has something the others don't, I can't put my finger on it but it just does. Horror fans should enjoy this a lot and I would recommend it to people who like something a bit different, yes it's pretty tame and could be a lot scarier but it doesn't out stay it's welcome at all. Check it out people, and discover the great actress Miss Taylor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good story and surprisingly well-made. Suspense built slowly and seemed in hand of competent director and actors. Film was in 3 takes. The introduction, the main play, and surprisingly the post episode was genuinely frightful. There was a moral ending instead of senseless chop-em-up flicks. The cast was perfect. Rachel Taylor was a good actress and very believable as the young wife of photographer Ben. The Japan outdoor scenery were breath-taking. Only complaint - the Japanese women were shown and treated as objects; and the women seemed amendable to playing that role. Maybe that's reflecting the cultural norm in Japan. Otherwise a good movie night if you want enough scares.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very morose and pretty bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a richer cousin of films like "One Missed Call", where Hollywood remakes a successful Asian horror film trying to gather more audiences since there are people in the world who hates reading captions of foreign films, so they film a English version and everybody gets happy (or not which is my case). And the similarity between both films does not stop right there. This is also a story where ghosts from the past comes back to life to scare and kill away a bunch of people, deaths that seems random and with no connection but there is one goal to be achieved by these ghosts. Instead of an cell-phone, the ghosts come out of photographs in bizarre moments; spirits ruining the photos taken by Joshua Jackson while enjoying honeymoon with his wife (Rachael Taylor), and also taking photos (that will be ruined too!) for his work making a great advertisement for a big company.Their problem started after accidentally run over a girl in the woods, and it looks like the girl's spirit is chasing them and killing some of their friends. The photographer's wife decides to investigate ghost appearances trying to understand what's behind all this, becoming an expert out of nowhere."Shutter" has an style that is becoming a trend in horror films with a unfair fight between real world and imaginary world or people versus spirits, where one can attack and the other can only run and hide; Father Merrin and Van Helsing are not here to help them, and charismatic and intelligent guys like them does not exist in films like these and that is a shame. Worst than this: it's not a scary film and not even funny. It's just morose. But the plot twist at the ending, reminding of "Ghost Story" (1981) was amazing, lift up the movie a little bit, but not enough to make a good film. The main couple has a charm and a good presence but that's it, with the help of embarrassing special effects they'll be scared for life with a strange ghost behind their backs. Bad, bad, bad. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really surprised by this movie because it seemed like the movie would be another Ring type movie because a paranormal spirit would attack the main characters, but it was not. Ben, a photographer, comes to Tokyo Japan for a new life with his wife and the past to brought back when a ghostly presence follow him around. The movie then explains why ghost seem to follow around people who are alive. I love Rachel Taylor in this movie because the ghost is mainly trying to tell her something.She finally finds out what it is and results change the movie. A lot of twist and turns in this movie but the ending is pretty surprising.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I really don't understand why a great majority of people are so negative about this film. I am a huge fan of horror movies, believe me I have watched masses, and trust me that this film is not as bad as people claim it to be. Over the recent years we have been plagued with remakes of Japanese horrors and usually the originals are way better. It is the same in this case, but it is still a film that offers many scares ( many refer to these as 'cheap scares', but IT IS rather entertaining and I found myself jumping a few times. :') The plot I have found interesting and was quite surprised by an ending. Acting wasn't too bad from the actors, and especially Joshua Jackson played his role well. The film was neither too long nor too short. If you have some free time, it's worth to give it a try. :D</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't realise that this was Americanised remake of the Japanese original, I knew it was rated very lowly by the critics, I guess I just wanted to watch it for the sake of watching a bad film, hoping to agree with the critics. Basically Benjamin 'Ben' Shaw (Joshua Jackson) and Jane (Rachael Taylor, a near spitting image of Nicole Kidman) are newlyweds, so are naturally taking as many photos as possible, whether meaningful of mundane. They move to Japan because of Ben's new and exciting job opportunity, a photo shoot in Tokyo, but on the way, driving on an icy road through a dark forest they seem to hit a girl and skid off road, but then they wake up, no body. Jane is sure of what happened, but she and Ben continue on to find their new perfect home, which they quickly, and the taking photos continues. Recently though when taking photos, Ben and Jane notice a strange white light is in most of them, and an expert tells them it is the sign of a spirit, i.e they have a ghost. With a series of nightmares, and worse strange events and attacks, the couple confirm that they are being haunted, and it appears to be that Japanese girl they hit with the car. But Ben reveals a very scary fact that he knew the girl, named Megumi (Megumi Okina), she used to be a stalker to him, she never left him alone, and they tried to frame her with some photos, but it turned into rape, and she committed suicide. In the end, Jane leaves him, and the saying "she's with me all the time" is very literal, she has been sitting invisible on Ben's shoulders since her death, explaining his weird neck thing, and in the end turning catatonic he is in a mental hospital. Also starring David Denman as Bruno, John Hensley as Adam, Maya Hazen as Seiko, James Kyson-Lee as Ritsuo, Yoshiko Miyazaki as Akiko and Kei Yamamoto as Murase. Jackson and Taylor are slightly dull together and separately, there may be at least one jump that actually got me, and the moment or two that was chilling, but almost all the way through was bored, not scared and unimpressed, a silly remake horror thriller. Poor!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This version of shutter was very disappointing! I watched the Thai version of Shutter first and it has so much more to offer! In this American version the ghost is not even scary looking. I actually found myself laughing at her because she just looked like a normal girl who was mad at the world. The Thai version of Shutter creates a horrific looking ghost that will make you jump out of your seat many times throughout the movie. The acting in the Thai version is better and so is the direction. This is just another ridiculous American re-make that doesn't know what its doing. Bottom line, if you want to see the REAL version that will actually scare you then watch the original Thai version, and yes you will have to read subtitles, but it is worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honeymooning in Japan, a young couple run over a woman in their car. Or do they? The mystery of whether or not they did is compounded when, Omen-like, their photos begin to be obscured by smears which begin to reveal themselves as the woman in the accident. Then the new young wife begins to find out who the woman is.This little ghost story is a western remake of an oriental film - there's a lot of it about - because western audiences can't cope with subtitles (something genetic, apparently, the bit of the brain which can read a line of text below while watching moving pictures above simply isn't present in occidentals). I haven't seen the original, but this isn't bad. It's mildly creepy with no major surprises - you don't jump, and you don#t have to watch from between your fingers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unscary and unthrilling attempt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say first that I have not seen the original, but this has definitely pushed me to do so. Why? Because, while it is not an entirely original concept, it is one that has a very strong possibility to create some real scares. I've experienced spirit photography and worked in the field for a while, so the story is an interesting one to me.But, why did this fail? It has an actor that I've enjoyed since my youth (Josh Jackson since the 'Mighty Duck' series), an interesting story (spirit photography), a beautiful backdrop (Tokyo), and looked pretty good for its meager $8 million budget.The simple answer to its failure is this: It completely ruined every single thrill and scare it was trying to give. For instance, when Ben (Jackson) was in the studio in the dark, this could have been a terribly frightening scene. . . but it just wasn't. I'm not entirely sure WHY it didn't give a single good scare in this scene, but it just didn't.Another mark of failure was the overall pacing. It would shift from long periods of no/subtle ghost activity and then hit a patch where every single scene would have some type of "big" ghost scene (the most obvious instance of this is after they go to Megumi's place and return home). It made for an overall boring film with a few chunks that overdid it with the attempts at scares (almost all of which failed).From a technical point of view, the direction wasn't too shabby and managed to make a very good-looking film. The script needed some work, as I said, with the pacing. It did work fairly work with some of the character building, but I would have liked to see a bit more of the downward spiral of the two main characters. They seemed a bit too. . . well kempt for having been tortured by a ghost for weeks/months. Also, the acting was very stale and stiff for the most part, with most of the actors just moving through without passion.Overall, it was watchable. . . but, truly nothing special. There's nothing very new here and I can imagine many losing interest halfway through. However, the twist is interesting enough to warrant sticking with it, even if it's not all that surprising.Final Verdict: 5/10.-AP3-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me Explain the wrong Vowel summary, Should have took the "U" out and replaced it with a "I" reading "Shitter!" This is really that bad, terrible acting from all concerned the only saviour cinematography which by all accounts is very good. The story line is so predictable that you as the viewer are 10 minutes ahead and know exactly whats coming next, if you have viewed films of this type before ( i know you have otherwise you would not be reading this) there is nothing new here for you to see. Quick Breakdown of story: Couple get married , Move to Japan, on route Run Down fully clothed girl in middle of nowhere, couple knocked unconscious and when they awake girl is gone from road and no trace of Blood etc etc. Hubby is photographer and every picture he takes has a strange blur in photo's(the ring) Girl then starts to haunt the pair, glimpses in dark corners, behind people, images in photos etc etc could somebody be hiding a terrible secret and the girl wants revenge? shock horror!!! lets face it Scooby doo and the pesky kids could have worked this one out! Anyhow, Couuple flee Japan after a couple friends meet their maker in bizarre deaths, but yep you guessed it, girl follows back to New York where suddenly what you knew was coming is revealed.. Wow! One saving grace and was pure genius was the nurse weighing Hubby at the hospital as a result of crash, the reason for puzzled look on nurse's face is revealed at the end of the movie! Luckily i did no pay to see this movie so did not learn the hard way. Try it if you like the genre but otherwise my advice is to avoid. Peace!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>White Noise and The Ring played with photos instead of tapes and audio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say that the Hollywood J-horror has outstayed its welcome since first arriving many years back with The Ring would be an understatement; nowadays it's not uncommon to see three, four, maybe even five releases in the one year, all of which being more or less unidentifiable from each other. The one difference that most do have however lies in their basic premise, or concept, or gimmick. Shutter's gimmick lies in the paranormal field of spirit photography; ghosts or spirits that communicate their overwhelming emotions and unfinished business through the medium of photography. As a concept, it flat out beats the vast majority of the others that have graced the big screen so far this year, but lumbered with the same run of the mill techniques to convey its concept, the movie as a whole feels tired and lazy. The performances aren't half bad, and there are moments when Shutter does get a little intriguing but unfortunately much of this is usually followed closely by arrays of problems. Fans of the genre should probably give it a look but then again, anyone who has seen more than a few of such films really won't be surprised by how things unravel here.For this spooky adventure we follow photographer Benjamin Shaw (Joshua Jackson) and newlywed wife Jane Shaw (Rachael Taylor) as they travel to Japan for business on account of Ben's new job. Japan being the misty, forest-filled country that it is however, soon has tourists Ben and Jane lost in the middle of nowhere and lo-and-behold, they run over a weird looking Japanese girl in some eerie dress from the twenties. Following this, it appears that Jane and Ben can't escape the image of the girl whether it's through their own eyes or the lens of a camera. Herein lays Shutter's biggest interest which purely lies in the concept of a spirit contacting people through photographs; sure it's undoubtedly ridiculous, but as a cinematic premise, it's not bad and lends well to creating atmosphere and tension. As is mostly always the case with films of the genre however, the writing is far overdone here, and soon the idea turns into an over-analysed gimmick that the writers and their characters try far too hard to explain. Director Masayuki Ochiai does well to try and cover up much of this detective-mystery tangent in order to conceal, and in turn develop some tension, yet the scripts insistence on giving reasoning too often overwhelms its insistence on telling an interesting, scary story.Main characters Ben and Jane are your typical horror movie newlyweds; both are madly in love, and as such their gradual loss of reality soon contrasts with their early airy nature. Jane, the movie's lead figure (one wonders how women got dumped with occupying most lead roles in these stupid films) is nothing out of the ordinary; emotional, unable to escape the visions she's having and adamant in her craziness, she provides the film with its driving force; she's the one who asks questions and seeks answers. In such a way, Jane isn't so much a character as a plot device, cold and boring in every respect. Actress Rachael Taylor isn't incompetent in her role here, yet she never does anything remotely remarkable either; like her character, she blends in with the background far too much. Husband Ben again fails to stray too far from the workaholic, doubting companion figure yet at least actor Joshua Jackson shows a bit of personality in his performance. As a pair they are unconvincing both in their reaction to what is going on around them, and to what is bubbling around inside them; there's no love here, and while fear is present when needed, it always seems inconsequential.Perhaps the single greatest feature of Shutter lies in its score penned by Nathan Barr. While it certainly has its moments of blandness, every now again certain scenes are given extra depth and resonance through Barr's string pieces which create a sense of spiralling insanity on their own, even if the accompanying photography is everything but. For a movie about spirit photography, Shutter is surprisingly unconvincing through its medium, and Katsumi Yanagishima never takes advantage of the subject that he is photographing; there's no imagination present in how this film is shot, it just is, and it feels just as generic as the two or three other movies of similar style this year. And yet, this sentiment just about sums up the entirety of this latest instalment of creepy for the sake of creepy paranormal detective drama; perfunctory, predictable, tired and overly familiar, Shutter is sporadically interesting but such moments are far and few between. For fans of the genre, you could do worse, but one feels that Hollywood should give it a rest with these for a while, either to let them grow up or simply to come up with new ideas; Shutter has neither, it's White Noise and The Ring played with photos instead of tapes and audio. Unless you love this sort of thing, I suggest you give this one a miss.- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not since Thirteen Ghosts (2001) have I seen a movie that is SO loud. Here, they made the "jumpy" scenes so loud so it would scare people (mind you this is coming from someone who LOVES going to concerts, especially the best band ever Iron Maiden). That aside, Shutter is like an alarm clock in an empty room. It goes off for a bit, but then after a while, it does its job and shuts up because nobody cares, and nobody, yes, nobody even has a CLUE that it turned off... let alone even turned on in the first place.Shutter is a remake of a Thai film of the same name, except this time directed by a Japanese filmmaker (kinda like the Grudge, except Takashi Shimizu had directed the previous one too). You may recognize the director's name, Masayuki Ochiai, if you have a knack for Japanese horror films, because he had already directed Infection (back in 2004, part of the J-Horror theater series), which, from what I've been hearing, is a good movie even for it's genre. Shutter isn't. And while I must admit I did find the concept remotely interesting (spirit photography), like most horror movies nowadays, is poorly executed.(Warning, this may contain spoilers) So the story goes: Benjamin Shaw (the aforementioned Joshua Jackson) and Jane Shaw (Rachael Taylor) have just gotten married, and as a part of a career Benjamin dreams of, move to a loft in Japan. Before getting the loft, they give themselves a little holiday, and get away to a cabin near Mount Fuji. On the way to the Cabin, they imagine themselves hitting a girl standing in the middle of the road. They crash, and are knocked unconscious for 4 (or so I think) hours. The next day, it's snowy (Continuity error number 1), and they wake up, while Jane looks for the girl they hit. Apparently, there was no girl. Hmmm, that's strange! Anyways, to the Loft. A week later after staying in the beautiful (apparently it's "SO beautiful I'm surprised I haven't take pictures of it yet" in the words of Benjamin) cabin, they move to a loft, and they are able to pursue a photography career. However, the pictures they took from the cabin arrive, and there's something fishy here- there's a weird light-like effect in the pictures. I dunno how that got there, Nor do they. They're sure it's just something with the camera, in which I'm sure it wouldn't be. However, this isn't just with THESE pictures- On the 2nd photoshoot (which involves girls dressed up old-fashioned amongst a modern background, which is actually a pretty cool concept if you ask me), in the camera's previewer, a girl magically appears. That's also strange, because she's not amongst the other girls!But this isn't just with those photos- it's happening in EVERY photo they take. This woman is appearing in the photos is the girl Jane thinks they hit (Continuity error number 2- Her clothes keep changing in each flashback to that night). We don't really know who she is until midway through the movie (I won't give away the whole thing). There's this one friend of theirs living down there, the really cute Seiko (Maya Hazen). She takes Jane to the leader of a Spirit photography Magazine, and Jane is given an issue of the magazine. I'm not gonna say the rest, because right now, typing the whole thing up is really wasting my time when I could be out doing things like riding a bike, visiting friends, etc.... But then again, that's the case with the whole movie.The main problem with Shutter is that everything in the movie seems forced. I haven't seen the original one yet, but I can assume that one is much better. I mean, a whole lot of the movie doesn't make sense. I also noticed a lot of religious undertones in the movie, it's like they're smacking you across the face with a bible. Or some book on Buddhism or something since it's in Japan, I'm not sure. The story is interesting but told in the most unprofessional way possible. There's plot holes GALORE, stuff which doesn't have any relevance to the story whatsoever, and even a twist at the end which feels silly, stupid, and tacked on at the last minute.Joshua Jackson has the facial expressions and acting talents of a wooden chair. Throughout most of the movie he mumbles incoherently, especially in the scene where they visit a spirit expert and he translates for the character Sarah- you can hardly make out what he says (how Rachael Taylor made out what he said, I have no idea). Rachael Taylor seems to have gotten her acting talents from Joshua Jackson, but now that I come to think of it, that's actually quite understandable- I really don't expect the elementary-level script to have excited them to the point where they actually started caring about their characters. Sure, the film isn't COMPLETELY terrible- it has some moments that are creepy and build tension, but just "some" moments ain't enough. If this film had any potential, it certainly would have been frustrating. And if it had a good cast too, it also would have been frustrating too- but at least it would have been easier to watch. A lot of people say "If you ain't got nothing nice to say, don't say nothing at all". Well, there isn't a whole lot of nice things to say about this so I think I'll shut up now. Instead, I'll just end this review with a quote from Norman Jewison from the Toronto International Film Festival 2004: "You wouldn't believe all the bullshit those studios want you to make nowadays".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A waste of time - sorry, but it's true.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Repeat after me: Boring ? contrived ? predictable ? a waste of time.I really tried to get into this movie but just couldn't do it. It had a couple of good moments but on a whole I felt I'd just wasted my time. I don't expect much from this type of film and perhaps I'm being overly critical - but, damn - it just didn't do anything for me - perhaps I need to view it again with an even more open mind. But then, what's the point - right? If I have to try a like something it must not be very good. After all - I love most B-grade horror movies - but, not this one.Michael</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The American Encore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remaking Japanese horror movies seems to be the latest film-making trend these days and "Shutter" is no exception to the rule. The Japanese are a highly superstitious people concerning the paranormal and their fascination and/or reverence for it clearly comes across in their films. To that degree, they are the leaders in the horror film genre and always manage to be more creepy and hair-raising than their American counterparts. Filmmakers here in the States must've figured that out long ago and are seeking to profit from it. It's a shame really, but then again, isn't imitation the sincerest form of flattery? It must be, since so many of these Japanese filmmakers are sanctioning these remakes.Take for example the one that started it all: "The Ring", a horror film originally entitled "Ringu" by Hideo Nakata made in 1998. Gore Verbinski remade it in 2002 and when comparing the two films, several shots were arranged in the very same manner and the art direction is curiously similar. In the five years since then, "The Grudge", "The Eye", "Dark Water", "Pulse" and "One Missed Call" have all made appearances, their Americanized stories culled from their Japanese counterparts. At first wildly popular, the Eastern horror juggernaut must be slowing down because "Shutter" made a modest $10.4 million it's opening weekend and a domestic gross of less than $26 million compared to the staggering box office of "The Ring" (domestic gross was $128.5 million)."Shutter" begins with just-married couple Ben (Jackson) and Jane (Taylor) as they embark on their lives together into bustling Tokyo. Ben's occupation as a fashion photographer moves them there (much the same as Charlotte's husband in "Lost In Translation") and while the couple are cutesy and affectionate, it ain't all sweetness and light - somebody's got a dark past and it's about to get unearthed in the creepiest manner possible.Ben and Jane's married life gets off to a rocky start. As they are making their way on a dark wintry road on the outskirts of the city, an unidentified woman steps suddenly from the shadows in front of their vehicle and Jane slams on the brakes, fishtailing off the road and slamming head-on into a tree. When both of them come to after passing out, there is no trace of the woman despite a police search and inquiries to local hospitals. As they try to forget about what happened, images of the woman both in Jane's dreams and in her waking hours make it impossible, as do all sorts of photographs they have developed after the crash. Every picture Jane or Ben takes contains paranormal imagery and convinced it is the girl that she saw in the road that night, they go to an expert in spirit photography to help analyze their photographs. When given an unsatisfactory answer, Jane does some of her own sleuthing and armed with a Polaroid camera, she snapshots her way into a startling discovery with the guidance of the agitated specter.Jane links the spirit, Megumi Tanaka (Okina), with her husband and he admits to a long-ago relationship with Megumi that went horribly awry. It isn't long after his confession that Megumi begins to haunt those she knew in life and people start to have strange "accidents" resulting in their deaths. We think Megumi is simply a predator bent on destroying people who have wronged her but a character's words always come back to "haunt" us throughout the film: Why go to all that effort unless you have something to say? "Shutter" may be predictable for that very reason (as many will speculate) but it's a cut-and-dry 90 minutes so you don't get strung along for too long with this been-done formula. It's twist ending is hardly a twist, seeing as how so many filmmakers go for that anymore but it's entertaining enough for a Saturday night rental with the lights out and a tub of popcorn in your lap.The "Shutter ? Unrated" DVD has an array of featurettes along with commentary and an alternate ending that's not really worth it (there was only a minor change ? the ending remained largely the same).Bottom line: "Shutter" doesn't really live up to its predecessors (namely "The Ring" ? that's still my top choice for Japanese remakes) but if the story interests you and you enjoy a good paranormal yarn, it's a potentially satisfactory choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was bored with this movie from start to finish. I can honestly say I wasn't scared, surprised, startled or otherwise unnerved at any point in the movie. This film was not frightening in the least. It follows a formula that has been done too many times. It is painfully predictable and brings nothing new to the table. You see a story with methods and "twists" that have been used time and time again. I can't understand how whoever made this movie thought that it was in any way original. I hope the next "horror" film I rent is a better representation of the genre and not some ridiculous cocktail of the worst parts of a few weak horror movies.</fullReview>

But i want to say that i watched many Hollywood's's horror movies but i don't know why there is nothing new. There are all old themes &amp; concepts, some are re makings of old movies like Hills have eyes, Haloween, Dawn to dead, Day of dead etc. People always admire or like to see new ideas, so i would suggest that Directors of movies should prepare their-selves for some experiments &amp; new ideas. Just like "Ghost Ship" was a good new idea. But usually Indians copy the movies of Hollywood mostly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I almost didn't make it all the way through this slow-paced movie. Most of the scares were cheap, and you could see them coming a mile away. Very cliché stuff going on here, it's like the director hasn't seen a horror movie for 20 years.That being said, it does start to pick up near the end. It also has a "twist" ending, which was a real relief for me. Was thinking of rating this a 4 tops, until it added rhyme and reason to why the events were taking place. Still kind of predictable though, but at least it did deliver somewhat.You don't HAVE to see this movie, but if you're into horror and are able to give it a chance, it's not TOO bad.

This is one of the best non-American horror movies I have ever seen! It is pretty scary seeing as how a ghost in a photograph can be the most scariest thing to think about. It is really a masterpiece and deserves a higher rating then it has! I mean even though you have to read text I promise you will love it! The whole thing is a build up toward the awesome climax! It really makes you realize how gifted these types of ghost movies are from different countries! First it was The Ring now this!

		<fullReview>The first hour of Shutter is down-right boring. Nothing happens except from the car-crash and a few short images of Megumi, the girl they hit with their car.But the last 30 minutes are horror at its best. The actress playing Megumi, who is also named Megumi in real life, but with a different last name that they hit are truly scary looking. And there are many disturbing images that will stay with me for a while after watching this movie.The ending is really creepy.The only thing that is a let down is the acting of Rachael Taylor. She is never convincing and the way she leaves her husband before he finds out the truth about him and Megumi, would never happen in real life.Also considering what he did to Megumi it seems strange he kept not only the camera she gave him, but also the memory-card with the photos that could send him to jail. But that was necessary for the ending.But that's okay, considering the scares are really good.</fullReview>

I am a fan of PG-13 horror movies, and I get scared on most of them, but this one failed. The story was a simple, but it was somewhat good. But in the end, the story just barely had a purpose. I have not yet seen the original movie from Thailand, but what my instinct say is that it could be better. Hopefully not like Pulse. Americans should stop trying to make remakes and try to make good original horror flicks that could be good in order for other countries to want to make remakes of American movies.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shutter Another Disappointing Horror Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shutter is another disappointing horror remake from director Masayuki Ochiai who does a decent job with this film but the lack of real scares, suspense, and an original ghost is what weighed down the film the most. The cast for the most part are okay in their roles but nothing memorable including Joshua Jackson, Rachel Taylor, and John Hesley in a brief extended appearance. This film was really lacking inventive scares, suspense, and a scary villain who seemed to be just a rip off all the other vengeful woman ghosts who can be found in many other horror movies out there. The eventual surprise dealing with one of the characters I sort of saw coming and the ending wasn't the greatest either but then again when do most horror films have a happy ending. There was a little suspense but no real scares fortunately they kept this movie to a trim 85 minutes but after watching it you still feel like that was a total waste of time. Overall Shutter has an interesting premise but little suspense, no real scares, originality (villain wise), and it doesn't offer anything new or exciting to the genre. Even the cast who put in an effort can't save Shutter from joining the long line of disappointing re-makes coming out these days. If they amped up the suspense, scares , and a more original villain the film Shutter would've been that bad but it ended up being a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not completely original, but decent viewing for an evening ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what the obsession with Asian horror is, because most movies based on them seem to bomb. However, this one was a bit better. It's got a familiar ghost story theme, but it's still decently executed.The story is basically about an American couple in Tokyo who accidentally hit a girl while driving. Not long afterward, vague images of her begin to show up in their photographs ... and the story progresses from there.Sound predictable? Surprisingly, there's more to this movie than that simplistic plot. I didn't think that there was and I was even beginning to get irritated when husband took on the typical blindly disbelieving sidekick role. However, even that led lead to some interesting developments.All in all, this movie is decent viewing if you're watching it on TV late at night. It's atmospheric, serious in tone and has a relatively decent story. Not great - but not too terrible either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The weakest Asian horror remake of them all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not going to be a review of the American version of SHUTTER per se, but rather a comparison to the Thai original. A short one. The concept is flawed right out of the gate--why Japan? Because of the Japanese director? Japanese co-funding? Either way, the story just doesn't hold well in its Japanese reincarnation. The producers simply should've booked the writers/directors of the original; the new guy although Asian, has come up with a very generic horror remake. His pace is wrong, the casting isn't very convincing either. The editing is below mediocre, and the cinematography only so-so. Oh and even the score is a big fat cliché on its own. Whereas the original is really solid and takes its time, slowly building the plot, but not for a second letting you off the hook. Another thing--the Ghost here simply isn't scary, she's sort of bland. And the extreme creepiness of the final twist here is done completely wrong. A triumph of mediocrity, this remake. And this is probably mildly put.</fullReview>

This time though you're supposed to be given serial heart attacks by a ghost showing up in the pictures taken by a photographer (the annoying guy from Dawson's Creek). No, not that guy, the other one, the r.e.a.l.l.y. annoying guy.And remember the little girl from The Ring? The one with the loose hygiene practices? Well, apparently she's all grown up now and minding her business as usual, i.e. hopelessly trying to be the resident creep in lousy J-horror remakes. And I almost could have sworn Naomi Watts was the female lead here too, but no, it was this younger lookalike they found somewhere. Easy on the eye, I'll give her that. Though her acting abilities rank somewhere between Joshua Jackson's and those of a jerrycan.Shutter commits that most aggravated of all horror movie sins: it fails to even startle people. Actually it's so tame it's been reported to have a soothing effect on people with pacemakers.Then there are all these moments when they build up some tension such that you expect to see someone getting it big-time. Then the most mundane thing happens, ridicule ensues, the Scary Movie franchise lives to see another installment. I'll give this one an extra star for the ending. Not that they redeemed it at the end or anything, it's just that I honestly appreciated the darn thing did eventually come to an ending.Oh,that's right. You read this to learn why they stopped making Polaroids.Um, because they're no longer economically viable?</fullReview>

My friend told me that the American version was better than the original. After watching the movie, I have to disagree. As usual, it was dumb-down significantly compared to the Thai version. The story was rearranged, so it was more A-B-C. It's like they couldn't make it jump here or there because it was going to confuse the American audience or something. The friends were barely in the movie, and so you really didn't feel what idiots they really were. It wasn't as bad as other remakes, but it could have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever and scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the remakes of Asian horror movies, this is the best. Other than The Grudge, it's the only one that has scared me, and been a good movie besides. I think it has several advantages over The Grudge: a solid story (rather like an old Twilight Zone), economy of means, and clever staging. Unlike The Grudge and most other horror movies, it employs few make-up effects, and uses those sparingly. It gave me chills quite a few times, but in the manner of someone stealing up behind you and touching you lightly with one finger. In this it runs against the current wipeout mode of horror movies, but it is more of one piece, and sticks by its characters instead of throwing them away at the end.Notice, by the way, that this movie and The Grudge are not really full translations from one culture to another; both ease the task by transporting their American characters to Asia. Though this movie was from a Thai original, it chooses Japan as its setting and, even more than The Grudge, becomes pretty much a Japanese horror movie with Americans. (These, existing in a superior little clique of their own and skim off the local culture without having any interest in it, come off like imperialist intruders; I think this was the impression intended.) I haven't seen the original of this, but I can't believe it can have been any better. The movie knows what it's doing--which is to say, it keeps its mind on what it's doing. It isn't all over the place; it devotes itself to one task at a time; keeps in mind at every point what the audience knows and where it is; and judges where each stroke should fall for best effect. The whole thing is cleverly calculated, right down to the casting--and that's as much as one can say without spoiling some of the surprise. I will say this much: in the first few minutes the movie does something that I think must have been deliberate, since it manipulates expectations and anticipation exactly to the purpose. I had to think it over afterward to realize how the trick was worked.The story has one noticeable fault, which it shares with several others of its type: the big clue that one of the characters follows to uncover the information being sought would require a leap of intuition most people would be incapable of; the screenwriter is, of course, but it's his clue. Also, a few of the shots were so oddly angled that I couldn't grasp what I was looking at during the short time they were on. I was seeing them on a TV; on a large screen they might register better.But those are just quibbles. All in all, the experience of this movie was like a walk through a terrific spook house. A job well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only good Japanese remake since THE RING (2002) that I have seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've had to endure a lot of American remakes of Japanese horror films. I loved the remake of THE RING. Gore Verbinski got it right. However, since that movie featured haunted video cassettes that kill after 7 days, we've seen haunted cell phones, haunted cameras in this movie and there will probably be haunted toasters, blenders and dishwashers before the cycle burns itself out - and there is no sign that it will anytime soon. This film has a plot and kind of stays on track for the most part, unlike a lot of the others. It keeps things manageable with a smaller number of characters you can keep track of and best of all, it actually has some pretty effective scares. There isn't much more I can say about it without revealing anything and you should check it out for yourself. It actually satisfies, unlike a lot of these things. I don't know how the Japanese version stacks up but this is actually a pretty good little film. I was pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually I'm pretty easy-going about horror movies; I can usually watch movies for their entertainment value, despite some of the lower remarks of some people. But this ain't one of them. This movie was boring. I mistakingly bought it partly because the DVD commercial looked interesting and partly because I thought the average IMDb.com rating was 6.4/10, not 4.8/10 (as it stands today). Nowadays, I usually try to avoid movies with a rating less than 6/10 (in most cases).In any case, this movie was boring and not even remotely scary. There were a few interesting scenes, but most of them were near the end/climax of the movie. Even the dialogue/relationship between Jane and Ben were laughable, though I cannot remember how at the moment. I'm beginning to wonder if I am beginning to block this movie from my memory (but not enough for me to watch it a 2nd time).To help give you an idea of how bad this was, I liked White Noise and Boogeyman (2005) better than this flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unholy amalgam of a few much better films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, here's a unique film plot for you: A young American woman, recently married to a young photographer, moves to Tokyo with him for work, but he seems far more interested in both his career and a lady friend he hasn't seen in some time, whom the wife immediately and instinctively dislikes. Since he's neglecting her for his photography work, she wanders the streets of Tokyo doing touristy things. Yes, Shutter's opening reel is almost directly lifted from Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation.But we have to switch into crappy J-horror territory sometime, so it deigns to rip off its own genre instead, blatantly stealing from a myriad of recent, much better horror films, The Ring and Saw chief among them. In fact, there are scenes where I literally had to do slight double-takes, as lead actress Rachael Taylor clearly resembles Naomi Watts (she's ALSO an Aussie blonde), and in numerous scenes, her hair is done in such a way that it resembles exact shots from Verbinski's film, in addition to thieving the slow Psycho touch-based spinning-chair-reveal (the setting, situation, soundtrack and look are what makes it indistinguishable from its excellent source). As for Saw, you know that terrifying scene early on when the little bike-riding puppet shows up and keeps giggling while the main guy is having flashbulbs going and screaming, "WHO'S IN THERE?!?". Well, that scene is repeated nearly verbatim here, and amusingly, it doesn't even make sense, as he comes across his wife and it instantly switches gears (and in a second viewing of the scene, I realized they were trying to scare you by putting the ghost girl in different places, but they're laughably inept at even this, not leaving the exposures long enough to even get the effect of the scene).The original Shutter is a Thai film (you can tell by how long the crew's names are), and that far-less-reviled production is set in Bangkok, which would have, if nothing else, at least provided a new and unique locale for this type of film, but the producers of this American remake were stringent in their desire for it to be as formulaic as possible, so not only did they transfer the film to Tokyo, they decided against hiring the original director, choosing to go with a *JAPANESE* J-horror hack. The acting is about as unremarkable as possible, and I can literally remember two FACES in the entire film, much less character names much less actor names.The film is remarkably easy to watch, if only because so little happens that it made it seem like less time had passed. Its' main competition in 2008 are the three other neutered horror films, Prom Night, as well as fellow J-horror wheezers The Eye and One Missed Call. The Eye was surprisingly decent, blessed with both a unique conceit and a desire to actually develop its characters first. Prom Night provided empty pain from the opening frame, and One Missed Call, well...at least had that creepy ringtone. Shutter didn't even have that. It just made me want to watch The Ring.{Grade: 2/10 (D) / #53 (of 59) of 2008}</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My family and I watched this movie yesterday and we all enjoyed it. Was it the best horror movie? No. But we were entertained. The theme of the movie becomes apparent towards the end and it does keep you guessing. Just when you think the movie is over...it isn't. For some that technique may be distracting but I actually feel it enhances a horror movie. The more the audience is fooled, the more potent the ending.Whether or not you believe in ghosts or ghost images, the theme of the movie is universal. We all pay the price for foolish acts whether or not we participate or just stand by and let it happen. The ending of the movie exemplifies this in a very creepy way.The fact that much of the movie takes place in Japan adds to the mood of the film. I have to admit that how Jane, wandering the streets of crowded Tokyo, manages to always find her way back to her apartment is a bit of a stretch. Anyone who has ever visited another city, especially one with a very different culture than our own, knows that you really don't want to go wandering the streets alone much less find your way around.If you're looking for a creepy movie, this might fit the bill. Don't expect Oscar-worthy acting, though. And don't expect scintillating conversation. The movie thrives on its creepy atmosphere, not dialogue.I have to say I did like the actress who plays the character of Jane. Of all the young faces on screen these days, she's pretty good. Something about her reminds me of Charlize Theron a few years back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much plot and not enough running time reduce the scares to a minimum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Apparently reasonably faithful) Remake of a Thai horror film concerns a woman and her photographer boyfriend who seem to be being bothered by the ghost of a dead Asian woman. Complex story is speedily told with varying degrees of success. Interesting but never really scary the films drive to condense a complex plot into about 85 minutes pushes many of the chills aside (to be honest the story is all there and nothing feels too rushed, as opposed to the recent One Missed Call remake which moved so fast that plot was overlooked or discarded). While there is some tension its never really enough to push it into must see territory (maybe if it had some memorable scary images instead of a solid pot). Certainly worth a look on cable or DVD, if you don't mind an okay little tale. (6 or so out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable remake, give it a chance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised by Shutter, the American remake of the Thai fright-fest of the same name, specially after the general bashing the movie received when it premiered. The original and way better one revolved around the story of Tun, an overall nice guy and professional photographer haunted by a mysterious figure that appears on his snapshots, after a weird road accident. As it turns out, not everything is what appears to be, because the strange figure seems to have a connection with Tun and his dark past. The plot flows nicely through it's interesting twists and turns, and the film gladly took a different route, not relying on CGI or special effects, but acting and atmosphere, to deliver the goods. The new version of Shutter, although enjoyable, suffers from a basic problem: the plot turned out to be contrived and full of gaps. It was like the remake had to fit under a very limited running time, so some major parts of the script were written off, when it was needed that this missing parts were shot and kept on the final product. For what it is, though, Shutter isn't that bad.People battered Joshua Jackson's performance, claiming that he didn't evoke the sympathy we felt for Tun in the original, but he did what he could with the material, and created an average, likable guy for whom you feel sorry for. Joshua didn't have to be Laurence Olivier, and frankly, he wasn't even supposed to. His job is to create an average, good sport Joe trying to make it big, although hiding a terrible mistake done in the past, and that's it. Director Ochiai used to the max the locations, the compelling shots of Tokio's exhilarating big streets filled with people and vibrating buildings work beautifully in contrast to the quiet, cold and old fashioned small towns nearby, making it an interesting visual experience. The supporting cast did good, although the characters of Joshua Jackson's buddies weren't fleshed out enough.The actress playing the ghostly girl stands out as Shutter's outstanding performance,marking the only point of this remake that turns out to be better than the original: the mysterious girl has some more presence in this version, mainly because the actress is terrific, even though her past and motivations weren't developed very well, the writers could have used some more depth (the main problem of the picture, as I've said before -contrived script, short running time). In the end, Shutter the remake gave me an enjoyable, entertaining evening in the theaters, uncompromising and light-weighted, not on par with its superior original source, but nicely done, shot, and satisfying. Don't compare it to much with the first one, leave your expectations behind, and give it a try, you will be gladly surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having watched the original the day before, I was intrigued to see how it had been adapted to a different audience.I was sorely disappointed. Maybe that is an understatement...They missed the unbelievable weave of the story and turned this into a disjointed hack.Ironically a movie involving a photographer was given cinematography like this. The original has so much in the way of great cinematography that it is sometimes distracting.Not only did they miss all the brilliance of the original, they even took the story to Japan. If I was involved in any way with the original I would be incensed.I would strongly recommend that anyone thinking of watching this get the original rather.Shame on the producers of this drivel. Shame on me for watching this till the end in the hope that it would somehow get better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse than anything Uwe Boll ever made...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into the theater to see this film, I had never seen the original. I was looking forward to this film after seeing the above-average remake of The Eye, but this was just terrible. I kept waiting for the movie to get to the scary part, or at least the INTERESTING part. It never did.The ghost in this film is the least threatening movie ghost since Casper, I swear. Apparently she kills some people, but we're not ever shown what her involvement in the deaths is. She doesn't even look or act scary. She's just... there.This movie also falls into the same pitfall of confusing gross with scary that the One Missed Call remake did and gives us lots of bugs and other creepy-crawlies rendered in mediocre CGI.However, unlike One Missed Call, there isn't a single piece of genuinely chilling imagery here to save the film. We are shown a few things that are supposed to be creepy, but they're just gross or boring.And the story is completely uninteresting. There is no sense of foreboding because the story never hints that the ghost is going to do something violent or scary. Maybe this was intended to make it scarier when she did, but that doesn't matter because it isn't at all scary in the first place.I won't reveal the final twist, but be warned... it's only unpredictable because it's so freaking stupid and not scary that you can't believe they put it in the movie.Overall, I can honestly say that this is the worst movie I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Grudge but with Cameras</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SHUTTER is just your typical grudge type movie copycat. The film begins with a newlywed couple on their wedding day, all smiles and then they go on their honeymoon. While they re traveling on a wooded road during the cold night a 'grudge' type woman pops out of nowhere and the wife (who is driving) accidentally hits her and then her car spins out of control and hits a tree causing the couple to pass out. When they wake up the mysterious girl has vanished and soon the couple just end up going to there destination, Tokyo where the husband has a new photography job. But when the mysterious girl's image starts to show up in photo's they know they're not alone and soon the wife starts to unravel a mystery involving the girl and her husband who isn't what he appears to be...My main problem with 'Shutter' is that its to predictable. The whole 'mystery' of why the girl is haunting them is blatantly obvious from the start, the viewer can easily guess she was involved with the husband. The film feels like 2004's THE GRUDGE (Which was much better) but with cameras. SHUTTER is an average film that really is only here because its the latest non scary Ring, Grudge copycat and Japanese remake. Overall, Shutter is entertaining but predictable.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, don't expect 'Shutter' to be the best movie you'll ever see--certainly, it is far from perfect. However, I saw it with no preconceived notions, and I left the theatre with a smile on my face. So while it may not be the best movie out there, it most certainly is not the worst.Sometimes, the movie does feel a little cliché, and the acting can feel just the same--sadly, the main protagonist of the movie is guilty of this crime. On the other hand, there were no flaws glaring enough to make me walk out of the theatre, so I can deal with small things like this.The movie only made me jump once or twice, and only then because my friend was making me really nervous. Don't worry, though, I got her back by jumping when nothing was happening, causing her to scream. The few "horrors" in this movie are mainly shockingly disgusting visuals and a few "boo!" moments, but other than that, don't expect to have nightmares.I kind of feel like this movie was a bit misrepresented. It wasn't really a horror movie--it kind of left me in a thoughtful mood. If you go into the movie with an open mind, I'm certain you won't be disappointed. The ending was certainly nothing like I expected--again, the movie was not the best, but you could do a lot worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I get scared pretty easily, and let me tell you: if you want to get scared, don't see this movie. It was pretty predictable, the acting wasn't that good, and it wasn't very creepy at all. The most horrifying part of the whole movie was when Ben's two friends rape his ex-girlfriend and he doesn't do anything to stop them -- not scary, but still horrifying.All in all, not a very good movie. My friend and I had a few good laughs while watching it (although the movie wasn't supposed to be funny), so I can't say it wasn't entertaining. It felt like it dragged on a bit despite being a relatively short movie.The room with all of the photographs was very creepy, though, as was the (somewhat predictable) final shot.Rent the movie if you really want to see it. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake of shutter isn't as good as the original Thai version. However, it was good that at least it wasn't shot in American as per typical Hollywood remakes of Asian horror shows.The Hollywood version is actually a collaboration with a Japanese studio, hence the setting in Japan. Most people who just watch movies just because it seems interesting will leave disappointed. You really have to listen and analyze the story in order to leave the theater fulfilled, knowing that you actually paid attention to the characters and not just the plot.The story is basically about a woman who marries a guy, but doesn't know the thorough details about his past, and ends up finding that he was a jerk to a Japanese woman working as a translator while he was on assignment in Japan. While in Japan for a honeymoon cum assignment, the wife slowly finds out about his past and why the spirit of the now-deceased translator is following them about and causing harm to her husband and his two close friends. It culminates when the newlyweds return to America, and she finds out the secret that he's been keeping from her.The ending is lacking, but at least explains that the spirit of the translator, other than wanting to warn the woman about the man she married, wants him for herself, as seen in the final scene.The effects, while not as scary as expected, were spooky enough. I would say that its horror content is about a 3/10. It really makes one think about whether the things one does in the past would return to haunt them in the future.</fullReview>

I watched the Thai one and thought it was outstanding, watch both and make up your own mind don't judge just by my own personal opinion but think it lacked substance, fear and atmosphere. Thought the two lead characters were very good, especially Rachael think she's stunning but for some reason when they make the American remakes they take that edge off, the little jumps, unexpected scenes and the effectiveness of the main 'scary' character. I just feel so disappointed after watching this. I can think of a few scenes from the Thai version that stick in my mind, none in this and its nothing to do with the fact I've seen the Thai one first. If you like ghost/haunting films, then go for the Thai version of this or Tale of Two Sisters, two great films which will BOTH no doubt end up being ruined by crappy remakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a bad movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And it had so much potential! It WAS NOT scary! It HAD NO plot! It was 1 hr. 23 Min's. but felt like 4 hours because it moved along so slowly. I have seen some stinkers (i.e. I Know Who Killed Me, Balls of Fury, Good Luck Chuck), and this was up there on the list of the all-time worst movies. Allow me to list some of the worse points of the... a hem... "film." 1. "The Script." It was so boring. Half the audience was laughing at how stupid it was and the other half was asleep. The best part of the movie was the audience's reactions! 2. "The Horror." Or lack thereof. An Asian girl wearing a hideous dress is not scary. Her just looking into the camera is not scary. A fly is not scary. The only thing scary was her dress.3. "The Choices." I know this is a broad topic, so I'll go into detail. First of all, Josh Jackson is not the star. He plays second fiddle to some unknown Elisha Cuthbert look-alike. Come on, Dawson's Creek has to count for something! Secondly, The choice in setting was all wrong. It should have been set in the good Ole' U. S. of A.. Cut out all the "Asian" scenes... audiences are tired of remakes and any Asian components are both unnecessary and ruin the plot/dialog/script. I'm not saying there can't be Asian people... the assistant was fine... but it does not need to be "Asianified". Make it in America! Make it ACTUALLY Scary! 4. "The Photos." We all went into this film wanting to see ghosts in pictures... admit it. I only wish I would have known before that I should have just internet searches "Ghost Photos". There were no "real" ghosts photos! I wanted to hear some scary stories about people who had their intestines turned inside out because there was an orb over their head in a photo from 1984!!! I think the film would have been a little better if it would have focused on the spirit photography instead of Joshua Jackson's character's personal demons. There are about 2 BA-Jillian movies out there where a character has personal demons. None of Spirit Photography, that I know of.So, now you see the reasons I have for you, loyal movie-goer, not to see this film. It will put you in a bad mood. Enough said!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always been a fan of Horror films, but it's only in this year that I've become a real devout fan and started to really peer into the depths of the genre. For instance, I used to have a very big problem with watching foreign films, simply wasn't able to connect with a film in a language I couldn't understand. However, luckily the Horror genre really cured me of that, and today Japanese Ghost stories are one of my favorite sub-genres.Shutter is the only Hollywood remake of a Japanese Horror film that I've seen after already seeing the original (haven't seen A Tale of Two Sister before The Uninvited, or the original Ring and Grudge before the remakes). It takes a lot out of the experience of watching such a film, as it's very loyal to the original, so anyone who's seen the original will not be surprised by the turn of events and twists...The real compliments I have for this film are for the excellent story and surprising twists that really caught me off guard, and should therefore go to the original version. This remake is, however, very well done.All I can say is that this film is recommended for all you Ghost stories fans who enjoy Hollywood more than Japanese cinema, or for you truly devout Horror freaks who'd like to compare this to the original. In any case, make sure not to pass on this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts out slowly and never really does pick up momentum. The plot centers on a young American couple that travel to Japan for their honeymoon, while on the way to their cabin they hit a young woman who gets up and disappears from the road. When Ben (the husband) gets an opportunity to shoot a fashion spread, Jane (the wife) starts wandering around Tokyo seeing the form of the girl she hit everywhere. As the movie progresses Ben's secrets from the past come out to haunt the young couple until the rather surprising end. While the plot of this story was interesting, the development was poorly executed. The acting was average, but the script never really fleshed out any of the characters and one was left with a feeling of apathy when the end credits rolled. Most of the movies in this day and age seem too long to me, but this one might have benefited if the producers would have added something to the story. At only 85 minutes the story just never took off the ground. I always know a good thriller/horror when I can't sleep after watching it and the night I watched this movie I slept straight through without a single image floating through my head. It was a good attempt at a scary movie but fell well short.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young American couple newly moved to Japan for his photography business find they are being haunted by the ghost of a Japanese woman who once worked for the husband. Her spirit keeps popping up in his photographs, and people close to the situation start dying in horrible ways. Later on, as things grow progressively worse, the wife discovers a terrible secret about the dead woman. This remake of an Asian vengeful spirit flick stars TV actor Joshua Jackson as the photographer and Rachel Taylor as his wife. The acting is barely passable, although there are a couple of decent "jump" moments. However, they are nothing you haven't seen before in movies like THE GRUDGE and THE RING. Speaking of other movies, the basic premise of this was lifted from an oldie but moldie with an all-star cast, GHOST STORY. Unless you're really bored, I'd pass on this one. Jackson is a very weak lead, Taylor is a generic wife, and nobody else in the cast caught my interest. They all just seem to be going through their paces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A married couple discover ghostly images in the photographs they develop and they discover a spirit of a dead girl is seeking vengeance.Shutter was released the same year as the Mirrors (2008), in the wake of other successful remakes of Asian chillers including the exceptional Dark Water. This offering is as average as it's 2004 predecessor, screenplay writer Luke Dawson injects the Americanisms and little else. There are good solid performances by Joshua Jackson and Rachael Taylor, with the template already set director Ochiai does a more than satisfactory job. He also makes the wise choice of using Japanese locations than sets, which are striking at times.Regrettably, everything is forgettable and it not the films fault. It's the fact that if you've seen any recent Asian remakes The Grudge for example; you know ten minutes in what the twist is going to be. There are some creepy moments and it's better than most of the remake batch including films such as the teen orientated One Missed Call (2008)and Pulse (2006).Shutter is competently spooky,with some nice effects and to its credit a lot better than the endless supply of teen horrors that are doing the rounds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Develops into a half-decent remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another week goes by, another remake of a highly regarded Asian horror movie passes by the eyes of tyler-and-jack. It's been a while since I've seen the original film but I remember being decidedly underwhelmed with it upon first viewing, thanks largely to the undeserved hype that all of these films started to acquire. Yes, there are a few genuine great films out there from our friends in the East and many genuinely spooky moments but not nearly as many as some people would have us believe.Joshua Jackson plays the photographer and Rachael Taylor (a new face to me but with a great mix of beauty and decent acting ability) is his girlfriend, the pair just about to arrive in Tokyo for Jackson's new dream job, served up thanks to an old friend of his. Before they get to the dream set-up though there's a bumpy road as the pair seemingly hit a young woman with their car on a late-night drive. However, the woman seems to disappear and all could be well . . . . . . if only she didn't start appearing in one form or another in all of their photographs.Anyone familiar with this particular subgenre will find themselves nodding knowingly as all of the usual factors are checked off. Dark-haired, moping girl - check. Unusual behaviour from modern technology - check. A tragic moment finally exposed in a revelatory second half - check. The occasional, impressive moment of actual spookiness - check. Yep, it's all here.The cast do well but struggle to really impress with material that already felt a little bit tired the first time around. And it must be said that, while comparisons are not always unfair they are inevitable, it still does not manage to be quite as spooky or enjoyable as the original movie.Nothing spectacular then but perhaps a movie best appreciated by those new to the genre "tricks" of the Asian film world, someone looking with fresh eyes upon material that others already find going slightly stale.See this if you like: Dark Water, The Eye, Phone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unrated DVD Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a remake of the original 2004 Thai horror film, newlywed Ben and Jane Shaw have traveled to Tokyo, where photographer Ben is investigating a potentially lucrative job opportunity. While driving on a dark road at night, the couple runs over a mysterious woman who seems to appear out of nowhere and can't be found after the accident. Over the next few days, Jane goes sightseeing while Ben works, only to see strange apparitions that also appear on the photos she takes. After Ben's photos show the same ghostly forms, he confesses that he knows something about the woman they ran over, but it may be too late to stop her trail of terror.I was surprised. I really was. Well, the idea of me liking this movie isn't a bit improbable, because I always seem to never loathe the new surge of Asian horror remakes that have been coming out the last few years. In fact, I seem to be enjoying most of them, but I was still surprised. Throughout the film, I found myself entertained and intrigued. Scared? When are they ever? Nevertheless, the film was entertaining. Do I keep my standards low? You can answer that yourself.I have never seen the original film (whoever does?), but I found the premise very interesting. I was hooked and never found a boring moment in the film...ever. Now that says a lot. Maybe the idea of spirits trying to contact humans from photographs is interesting. It sounds plausible too. It's not as if a tape is going to kill you in seven days, right? Just look at the infamous photo of Abraham Lincoln standing behind his wife after he died.The scares are kept at a minimum here, which is no surprise. After all, it's PG-13, geared towards a certain young demographic. However, there are still some moments of suspense and scenes I found disturbing, probably due to the extra five minutes in the unrated version I've seen. Also, the movie doesn't try to scare the audience with pop out moments. Doesn't that just annoy you? Thankfully, there aren't any here, or at least any major ones that I can remember. There is one fantastic scene that is pretty memorable and can get underneath one's skin. I'll not spoil it but I'll just say it involves a camera (duh). The scene is really well done which then leads me to the technical aspects of the film.I've got to say, I was impressed by the overall look of the film, most of it shot in Japan. I found the scenery just beautiful and gorgeous. The cinematography was great along with an actual score that I found stunning. I also liked the fact that there were little uses of CGI and big set pieces. The movie feels contained in its own world and it doesn't depend on CGI to make audiences feel uncomfortable. What made this movie not linger in the "bad area" were the leads. Joshua Jackson and Rachael Taylor were both great in the film. I really liked them.In the end, the movie also managed to trick me in one or two plot twists I didn't predict. Sure, the scares are mostly nonexistent, save two or three scenes, but what can I say? I found myself thoroughly entertained and intrigued from beginning to end. The leads were also pretty good. Overall, if you usually enjoy these PG-13 Asian horror remakes, movies like THE RING and THE GRUDGE, there's no doubt that you'll enjoy this too. For others, if you loathe these remakes, well, you know what to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shutter the Thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Remake of the Japanese movie of the same name "Shutter" has to do with this just happily married American couple Ben &amp; Jane Shaw, Jashua Jackson &amp; Rachael Taylor, who's trip to Japan, where Ben landed a job as a top fashion photographer, turned into a nightmare.Driving on a dark country road with Jane at the wheel the couple's car struck this young woman who seems to have materialized out of thin air. With the police at the scene finding no body, after Ben &amp; Jane's car smashed into a nearby tree, it becomes apparent to Ben at least that his wife, from the all night driving, was just hallucinating when she thought that she struck the young woman. It wasn't until a number of photo's that Ben took of Jane and himself with Mount Fuji as a backdrop that it became evident that the woman wasn't a figment of Jane's imagination at all! she was real! Real enough to somehow be able to get herself into the pictures and make her imprint on them!Later when Ben does his photo shoot for Japan's top fashion magazine the photos come out blurred with this white eerie ghostly streak running through them. Jane knowing that there's something very strange about Ben's ruined photo's notices on one of them that the streak points to the TGK building in downtown Tokyo where Ben, before he met her, used to work! Going inside the building to take Polaroids Jane notices a photo hanging on the wall in one of the offices that has a group photo with the mysterious woman in it! The woman, Megumi Tanaka, turns out to be a former employee of the TGK building and the person, who's name is printed on the back of it, who took the photo is non-other then her husband Ben Shaw!***SPOILER ALERT*** I takes a while for the film "Shutter" to get to the point of its story with Ben, who acted as if he was totally unaware of Megumi existence, knowing a lot more then he lead on to. Ben having had a affair with Megumi, before he met his future wife Jane, and then breaking it off drove the sensitive young woman to to suffer a serious mental breakdown. Trying to get Megumi, who was constantly stalking him, off his back Ben tried to blackmail her by getting his two American friends in Tokyo Bruno &amp; Adam, David Denman &amp; John Hensley, to get Megumi stoned, on wine mixed with sleeping pills, and have them photographed, by Ben, having sex with her. As it later turned out this attempt at blackmailing Megumi would soon lead to both murder and suicide to everyone involved with the exception of Ben Shaw. Megmi had something very special in store for Ben which in his case death would have been a much welcome relief!Nowhere as good as the Japanese version the film "Shutter" is still worth watching not only because its gorgeous photography of the Japanese countryside and the city of Tokyo but it's unexpected and out of left field surprise ending. It's then when Jane finally finds out what Ben has been hiding from her, in regards to Megumi, and checks out on him before the "shutter", a wall photo of herself, clicks open and shuts down on her!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah...I have to fill in ten lines to make my comment when the title summary says it all.It's a movie which is the same in many others, but set in Japan or China or some Asian country.The secondary story about a magazine publication defrauding pictures of spirits was a bit more entertaining than the first story.Maybe on Shutter 2 the writers will construct something that is built around the magazine company.Right now I'm at a loss for words as what to write.I've watched 20 movies in 3 days and now I'm just filling space.This was OK...not overwhelmingly scary, but the lead actress was pretty hot and thats where my vote goes to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shutter vs. Shutter: Comparing the original to the remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately, I took seriously all the gushing comments about how Shutter (2004) was "the best thing since The Ring" and out of curiosity watched it back to back with the remake. The only thing fans of the original got right is how dismally bad the remake is.Shutter (2004) would have been a lot of fun in the 1980s, and I can understand why kids and people new to the genre like it so much, but there's not much here for those more experienced in the genre -- Asian horror, or horror in general. It's not a bad movie, but I've seen the same story so many times in earlier, lesser-known Asian horror movies that it didn't do anything for me. The scares are all textbook routines; again, done well, but done so many times before they're never a surprise. I put off seeing this for years because it sounded so generic, and it turned out I was right. That said, it's a masterpiece compared to the remake.Shutter (2008) is so poorly written and plotted that it could only have been made in-house by studio wonks who don't have to go through the slightest quality control regarding scripts or production skills to get the green light on a film project. Shutter (2008) would have insulted me as a moviegoer even if it weren't a remake. The characters are weakly written and performed (this should be a career-ender for Joshua Jackson), and the special effects are so cheesy they're embarrassing rather than scary.Now I see why this new version makes fans of the original so angry. I'm not even a fan of the original, but I found it frustrating that the remake ineptly ignores the only story-telling hook that made the original good enough to watch in the first place. Then it goes on to parrot some of the original plot points while skipping others that make them contextually relevant. The result is a jumble of pointlessness. No one involved in the making of this film had any idea what they were doing.Verdict: Shutter (2004) was a decent movie, but nothing special, and has little to offer more experienced moviegoers who'll find it rather dull. Shutter (2008) is an insult, not to the original, but to the movie-going public that studio execs must think are tasteless imbeciles who will watch whatever crap they're given.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Jump Out of Your Seat Scary, But Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was going into this movie with mediocre hopes. I'm a fan of Joshua Jackson and Rachael Taylor, so I was pretty much just hoping the two of them would make the film entertaining, which they did. I think they made the film a lot more realistic and relatable than lots of other 'horror' film characters. The story was simple but very interesting because the turns sort of kept you going 'hmm...'. Most of the remakes of Asian Horror haven't been very much to my liking. I did enjoy The Ring and The Eye but I found The Grudge to be a little bit less my style. Shutter has all the classical elements of a haunting but it's got quite a few good twists and turns. Not the most terrifying ghost film ever made but I did enjoy it, especially Jane's spunkiness and determination as well as the twisted ending and would recommend it to anyone not going into the film with hopes of being scared witless. I give it 7 out of 10 for good acting, chemistry, cinematography and story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bit spooky. The real shame is waiting until the last fifteen minutes or so to really raise the hair on your neck. Photographer Benjamin Shaw(Joshua Jackson)and his new bride Jane(Rachel Taylor)fly to Japan so he can report for his new job, a very lucrative fashion shoot in downtown Tokyo. The honeymoon will become tense and stressful when they discover their personal photos contain ghostly reflections of a strange young Japansese woman. An expert on such strange occurrences says that the blurs are probable "spirit image" and may be a link to part of Ben's past. When two of Ben's working colleagues die mysteriously Jane is sure they are on the threshold of danger and fears for her husband's life. The newlyweds return to America only to find they haven't outrun the strange intruder. There is no hell like a woman scorned...takes on a new twist. Definitely creepy, but no real screamer. The cast is rounded out by: Megumi Okina, David Denman, John Hensley and Maya Hazen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, it's not The Ring but thank goodness it's not The Grudge either. So when are we going to stop ripping of Japanese movies and for the most part making them worse. When are these Hollywood types going to get it, the reason the ghosts or spirits or whatever they are, are all Japanese in the originals is because they were made in Japan. This does not mean that when you re-make them here in America the evil spirits all have to be Japanese, am I the only one that is bothered by this. If I ever saw a ghost that wasn't Japanese I wouldn't believe it was real and if it was Japanese I'd just kill myself right there because those spirits are relentless. Anyway back to the film, it didn't have the depth of story like The Ring (which I loved) did but it had way more story then The Grudge (which I hated). Sure all the story lines are a little weak but come on this is a horror flick so you've got to lower your standard a bit. The actors weren't great but did what was asked of them and I was glad they didn't go down the loan crazy women is the only person who sees these things road. I was genuinely surprised by some storyline tweaks at the end which was the same way I felt with The Ring. The attacks or appearances of the spirits whatever they are were unique and thankfully not over the top, well not too over the top. All said and done nothing great but as far as Japanese horror rip-off's go, I've seen worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's awful! The story (should there be one if you find it) makes no sense, has no continuity and yet, you manage to always know what's going on, meaning you're never scared or even mildly startled. The cinematography, well, if you like it when one scene cuts violently to begin another, you'll find this OK. The scenes of Japan look beautiful, please focus on that and not on the actual movie. No story, yet totally predictable. Not scary, awful side effects and also superficial, because maybe they could've gone deeper into spirit photography and it would've been more interesting. The performances were not terrible, for actors working with that kind of script. Overall, I know horror films don't offer much these days, but I'm sure you can find a better one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And here we go again! In 2004, the Thai movie "Shutter" made audiences cringe in terror. Now, in 2008, America has decided to once again remake an Asian film and take away all the whimsy and wonder that the Asian original had."Shutter" is about two recently married Americans who travel to Japan so the husband can work on a photography shoot while his wife sits around and watches her husband do his thing.One night they're driving and she sees a young girl on the road, but is too late to avoid her and hits her, but once the police arrive, there's no girl to be seen. She's still shaken over the experience, and swears that there was a girl on the road.Now both her and her husband's pictures are coming out weird, and they visit a paranormal photographer who tells them that a spirit is being caught on camera. She's convinced it's the spirit of the girl she killed on the road.Of course it's never that easy...well, it kinda is, but you can still act shocked.Lackluster acting, lame effects and hardly a traditional "jump scene" to be had, "Shutter" is definitely one of the lamest Asian-to-American horror movie transfers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lukewarm. Very lukewarm at best. These are the words that first came to my mind after I finished watching this movie. My main problem was that it is too predictable and presents virtually no original ideas. The title "Shutter" sounds promising and thus I was hoping to see more of a mystery or at least a different angle on creating intense, dark scenes.To be fair, the acting was totally acceptable. Though Joshua Jackson is the better known actor, it is Rachael Taylor who delivers. Even if you are not in the least bit into the movie, you can spend the next couple of minutes thinking what a marvelous job her hairstylist did. Of course that is not her only forte; she depicts the intensity very aptly.My problem is that the whole story seems so flat. All characters are fully predictable as is the plot.If you really have nothing better to do, it is worth a watch. Don't expect anything you haven't seen before though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For photographer Ben (Joshua Jackson) and his new wife Jane (Rachael Taylor), his new assignment -- a lucrative fashion shoot in Tokyo -- was supposed to be a kind of working honeymoon. With this exotic professional opportunity and the limitless possibilities of a new marriage, Ben and Jane arrive in Japan. But as they make their way on a mountain road leading to Mt. Fuji, their new life together comes to, literally, a crashing halt. Their car smashes into a woman standing in the middle of the road, who has materialized out of nowhere. Upon regaining consciousness after the accident, Ben and Jane cannot find any trace of the girl Jane believes she hit with the car.Shaken by the accident and by the girl's disappearance, Ben and Jane arrive in Tokyo, where Ben begins his glamorous assignment. Having worked in Japan before and fluent in the language, Ben is comfortable there, and he eagerly reunites with old friends and colleagues. Jane, a newcomer to the city, feels very much like a stranger in a strange land as she makes tentative, unsettling forays through the city.Ben, meanwhile, has discovered mysterious white blurs -- eerily evocative of a human form -- that have materialized on an entire day's work from the expensive photo shoot. Jane's concerns escalate as she believes the blurs in Ben's photos are the dead girl from the road, who is now seeking vengeance for them leaving her to die... So many bad movies happening.

		<fullReview>This title is nothing like the original Thai version. Well i find that there is nothing wrong with remakes but a good or bad remake heavily depends on the directors given and when given to a Japanese director don't get your hopes up. So far the Ring is still the best Asian horror remake so far (can't go terribly wrong when given to Gore Verbinsky).But overall this movie i wouldn't say its bad but just a pass if you have nothing to watch. However if you don't mind reading subtitles grab the Thai version because that is a MUST SEE!!!!My advice is when there is a remake try to see who is the director before you decide to see it or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That remakes of Japanese horror movies often hitting only once and thereafter is difficult that success be repeated. We saw with The Ring, it was achieved a film not so deep as interesting as Ringu was, but it has an atmosphere much more dense and dark, just enough to give a new magnitude to the film.Thereafter we have not been able to see a remake that at least show us something different. And if many people thought that after One missed call could not come another movie of this kind, just arrived Shutter. The film is not bad itself, is not an adaptation that has many flaws, but tries to be as attached to the original,the problem is the same that all horror films, at least supernatural, has: the use and abuse of clichés.The whole movie ends up being an eternal sense of "I saw this somewhere" and so nothing about the little of a lot of depth of story seems to cause the greatest impression on the viewer. Everything at the end ends up being a mere farce to pass the time and see a Joshua Jackson in a different role to that of Pacey so long that it has had box as the "good boy" of the stories, but even as we face something new. It will be for the next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We're Getting Better At Remaking....right?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There should be no doubt in anybody's mind that Asia has had an extreme impact on American horror. Within the past couple of months, the theaters have seen more than their fair share of remade Asian-horror flicks (e.g. The Eye, featuring Jessica Alba, and One Missed Call). Yet, what made Masayuki Ochiai's Shutter (based on the Thai movie of the same name) stand out above the rest was its style, psychological impact, and visuals.Let's face it. One Missed Call was nothing special, a far cry from The Grudge or The Ring in all respects. The Eye was interesting and had its moments, but all in all it had no real lasting effect. Shutter is closer to the old-fashioned ghost story. It doesn't waste most of its time with cheap scares, but takes the time to set up tense scenes that leave images in your mind. Rachel Taylor plays the role of Jane Shaw, the newlywed to Benjamin Shaw (Joshua Jackson) who moves with him to Tokyo where he has just received a job as a photographer. It is here that they begin to notice that in his pictures, and all other pictures of themselves, there are imperfections; what Ben figures is a "trick of the lighting" but which they soon find out is much more. These photographs are indeed evidence of "spirit photography" in which images of the dead are caught on film. It is clues hidden within these images that lead Jane to figure out who this person haunting them is and what she wants.However much better Shutter is from movies like The Eye and One Missed Call, it is not perfect and falls short in a few places. One was its editing. The movie ran only 85 minutes long, and I can't quite imagine why, but the editors for the movie felt the need to cut out many of the key plot points from the original movie. In watching the American version, I was saddened to see some of the scenes missing that really should have been in there and, if they had, would have made the movie make more sense. There were two key scenes in particular that they disposed of, and for this I highly recommend anyone to rent the original Shutter to see them. Where Shutter also fell short was its inability to keep up its originality. We've all seen the creepy girl with long black hair who walks funny before, and there was so much they could have done with the ghost's appearance; much that was done in the original, but tamed down for Western audiences.Overall, Shutter was well worth watching and a refreshing breath above many of the cheap movies being released all the time. I recommend seeing it in the theaters, but recommend even more so that you find a copy of the original Thai movie, sit down, and watch it first before seeing the American remake.</fullReview>

To us westerners, a foreign city and an alien culture is the perfect backdrop for a horror movie and I think the director captured this perfectly. The suspense built up nicely throughout and there were a couple of great twists when we found out Ben was not as innocent as we thought he was. I am a big fan of anti-Hollywood "mainstream" endings and this movie ended in exactly the right way.Don't be put off by fans of the original who have unfairly trashed this just for being a remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>there must be a lot of ghosts in Japan....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>since it seems every year, Hollywood makes a ghost movie set in Japan. Plus it seems the same female ghost stars in all of them. In this story, newlyweds Ben and Jane, move to Tokyo. Ben has lived and worked there before. He is a photographer. One night, they run over a girl in the road and crash. When they wake up, there is no sign of the girl in the road. It doesn't take long for Jane to think they are being haunted. Also, spirit flashes show up in the pictures Ben takes. What Jane doesn't know is that Ben knows more about the girl then he is letting on. Soon, Ben's 2 friends become victims, but why were they singled out. It's pretty easy to guess.This movie is written poorly. It's very predictable, using the usual scare tactics. The one cool thing was the film's explanation for the pain in Ben's neck. Watch to find out.FINAL VERDICT: Nothing great. I guess it's OK to watch if you think Joshua Jackson is hot. He's pretty good looking in this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was something that happens towards the end that should have been omitted (see the end of this review for the spoiler). Otherwise, there was nothing horrible about this film, but there was nothing memorable about it either. Perhaps if it was more atmospheric, it would have kept us more intrigued. Another way to deal with this is to connect the crowed Asian city with loneliness, but the film makers didn't seem to understand one of the basics of film making, which is to use visuals to reflect internal, psychological states. However, the biggest problem I had with this film was that it was difficult to feel much towards the main two characters.Now there is a good reason for this, and I won't spoil things for those who haven't seen the film, but I'll just say there was probably a better way to handle the situation Now on to the spoiler, so stop here if you don't want to know something that happens towards the end. Obviously, there is no way a young woman would have been deteriorating there for months, and it's not consistent with the story anyway. The film seemed too long, and the major development at the end, what the wife discovered about her husband, and what happened to him, should have been enough.One thing that could have been emphasized is that the woman/ghost was part of the problem - she wasn't totally right or horribly wronged, as if she had been murdered. In any case, something was necessary to "spice" this thing up, but instead it's almost seems like a ghost story "by committee."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Day, Another Horrible Asian Horror Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the words "PG-13 Asian horror remake" didn't make you want to avoid "Shutter", maybe these wise words will. IT SUCKS."Shutter" is the third PG-13 Asian horror remake of the year, following "One Missed Call" and "The Eye". "The Eye" was surprisingly alright, I give that an average 6 out of 10. "One Missed Call" was absolutely horrid, but it was extremely funny, even though it wasn't trying to be. "Shutter" may be a step up from "One Missed Call", but not by much.So, instead of a killer in your TV, or a killer in your cell phone, or a killer in your video game, in this movie, we have a killer ghost that you can only see by taking a photograph of it. The movie follows two newlyweds off to Japan so the guy, Ben, can have a photographing career there. On the way to Japan, they hit a woman in the road! OH MY GOD! Of course, there's no evidence there was a woman there, so they go on their merry little way, even if the girl, Jane, is a bit weary.Soon, you guessed it, strange occurrences start to happen. Was it the woman who they hit? Has she come back as a ghost? Or will there be a dumb twist (or multiple dumb twists) that will change everything? I guess you're just gonna have to watch the movie to find out, because I'm not giving any spoilers. But, if you really want to know what happens, just find out on the internet and save yourself an hour and a half of your life.The characters are about as developed as you'd expect from one of these stupid PG-13 horror flicks made for hordes of teenagers that don't know that they're gonna suck. So, that basically means you don't know anything about the characters. The twists are poorly done, they don't really even change anything, and they just seem thrown in to waste time. The dialogue sucks. The plot sucks. The kills aren't original, and since it's PG-13, it's about as gory as your average romantic comedy. There's nothing to recommend about this film. It's not even laughable, as "One Missed Call" was, it's just boring, stupid, predictable and a waste of your time.Plus the fact that the ghost is not menacing or scary in any way. She's not freaky looking like "The Ring" girl. She's just a normal looking Asian girl. Ooh. Freaky.Speaking of freaky, there's nothing remotely scary about this movie. "Shutter" aims low, with no real attempts at suspense, just stupid jump scare, after stupid jump scare, after stupid jump scare. It's like they weren't even trying. It's just the 'ol "girl looks scared, then the guy puts his arm around her, and she freaks out" trick OVER and OVER and OVER, until you're so sick of it, you just want the stupid movie to be over. There's not even stupid freaky-looking mothers and babies like there are in "One Missed Call".I got the Unrated DVD from Netflix, because I wasn't gonna pay to see this crap in theaters, but I have no freakin' clue how it's "unrated". I didn't see the PG-13 version, but I can't imagine it's that different. There's no gore, there's no nudity, there's nothing that could possibly make it even rated R. But, then again, it's probably just the same version put into theaters, with an "UNRATED" sticker put on the cover to increase sales.I have yet to see the original "Shutter". It's apparently supposed to be pretty good, and maybe I'll watch it, but if it's as bad as this one, I'm staying as far away from it as I can. I'll give "Shutter" a 3 out of 10, because it made me laugh from time to time. (Like when a character starts electrocuting himself, and when a guy gets his eye snatched right out of him)Oh, by the way, it's sad that the guy who plays Roy in "The Office", and John Hensley from "Teeth" agreed to be in this mess, because they actually have talent. Alas, alas.3 out of 10 (SKIP IT)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch original SHUTTER, Thai production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This US version is actually almost copy of Thailand version name SHUTTER as well. I watched it 3-4 years ago and believe me that we all family agreed that this is the best horror movie ever with DTS-ES sound. We were shocked that Thialand can produce something with excellent acting, excellent video and camera angels, excellent idea and excellent sound. The US version is almost the same/copy so i give credit back to original Thai version. You all guys must see the original Thia version. I don't see any much difference between US and Thai version. But anyways i don's mind to see both versions and i just watched the US version because i have seen the original Thia version so i was curious to know that can US make better than the actual version and i must say that US failed to produce better one, but US version is worth to see as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can easily see this movie taking bits from the Grudge and Gothika and interweaving them together into this stinker of a film. Can this film be docked for plagiarism? I really think it should be. There are many, many, many, plot holes and devices that seem too coincidental to achieve even a speck of verisimilitude. I don't even know why this was even set in Japan, it really added nothing to the film at all, if anything it took away, because you keep asking "why is this in Japan, what the hell is going on?" The acting was so awful, even in the scenes meant to be "emotional" or "scary" I found myself laughing - along side everyone else in the theatre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So here we have a movie called Shutter. This is based on some guy who did something to his previous girlfriend leading to her untimely demise. Then she haunts him. But the catch is she does so through pictures, whilst attempting to kill him and his current girlfriend at the same time. Either way the movie uses a camera to subject you the viewer to this entire plot. Woppie, let's see what I think. oh and by the way this is my opinion and i don't care if you don't like it because i don't know you. Okay is it just me or did the director of this see a preview for the wicked awesome series Fatal Frame, made by Tecmo, and Project Zero, and then have this random idea to entirely rip them off? Honestly it looks like they took all of the same ideas and kept slightly more people alive. I give this movie nothing because I would rather play the game and have a much better plot and play with the camera as well. Other then that hooray for another time waste of a movie during the rare point in time where hardly any good movies come out of the year. Hurry Summer for your huge block buster so we wont be subjected to anymore of this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is the almost exact copy of the version made in thailand. the version made in thailand has most of the focus on making it as scariest as possible. this is more of a remake of that version. If you are the kind of movie goers aiming for other elements, this movie is very lacking but it serves its purpose of intention. the US remake tries to put in the other elements but as you may see from watching, they are still lacking. I wont spoil the movie nor make a sugestion since the desires and preferences is upon the movie goers not me.In general, if you are not of those going for movies for other elements of a movie but are those that just enjoy the thrill of scary entertainment then this movie would be more suitable, but then i don't think its that scary, at least comparing to the scary thai films that i have watched before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do so many people hate this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit, the only reason i saw this movie was because i went to the movies with a friend and "Prom Night" was sold out, so this ended up as our plan B. When we walked into the theater I started to brace myself for what i assumed to just be another crappy American remake of what was originally a decent Japanese horror flick. In the beginning i did have my doubts. As Shutter started out, I found it to be pretty predictable, but as it went on me and my friend (who at any other movie would most likely be pointing out some horrible mistake made by the directors)found ourselves wrapped up in the plot. By about half way through the film the twists the story had taken had totally eliminated my previous expectations. While the movie itself isn't as "scary" as a few people have made it out to be, it still has its intense moments.And while the ending wasn't as surprising as I had hoped (after being won over by the second half of the film), this movie definitely earns a B+ in my book.I recommend you buy this when in comes out on DVD, or at least rent it and see it a few times.Hopefully, you won't be disappointed again in our culture and our never-ending talent for ripping good movies to shreds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Isn't it interesting to see how the Japanese succeed in creating an atmosphere of suspense without using an awful lot of violence? To me it seems, at times, that only the setting in the country of Japan causes the mystic ambiance to arise. OK, we've got to admit that we've seen all of this before, in the Ring. Same kind of ambiance, same kind of fear. But still, the skills of the actors and the creative way in which pictures are used to develop the story, makes it well worthwhile. This is not gonna be the best movie you've ever seen, but it's certainly going to give you an interesting viewing experience, and it'll keep you thinking for a little while after.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is it with these Japanese horror movies? They are all the same. All of them! Meaning, they are not scary at all. They always have some pasty faced ghost person seeking revenge. And it's not just the remakes. I've been forced to see the originals and they are not scary either.This movie in particular is frightening simply because a group of people actually paid money to make this trash! And for what? To create a boring, mind-numbing non-entertaining pile of dung. If every victim of crime in Japan became a killer ghost everyone in the country would be dead. The actors all sucked, especially the photographer guy. Who is this moron? Wait, I don't want to know. Why did he try to kill the ghost with a flash? It was never affected by any one of the thousands of flash photos before, so why would this butthead think a photo flash would somehow do something? WHY???? What a bunch of crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew going into this that I was going to get the same old flaws that come pre-packaged with any US remake of an Asian horror. Anyone who has seen the remakes of the ring, the eye, or the grudge shouldn't be surprised to find that, here too, much of the atmosphere and tension has been replaced with canned "BOO! Got-ya!" jump scenes.But in spite of this, and in spite of some seriously dire acting and a few other flaws, this remake still managed to hold together okay. The story is coherent, if a little clumsy. There's just enough momentum to keep your attention and the climax is sufficiently haunting. It's not the sleek vessel it once was - now it's more like a leaky, rickety thing, taking on water fast - but it still gets you there. Just.I'd recommend Shutter for those ghost movie fans who are just in the mood for something to fill up their Friday evenings. It's about on a par with the other American-Asian remakes, which still means it's fairly more intelligent than the typical home-grown horror flick. Don't go in expecting greatness, and you just might be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

No scares, no jumps, no gripping intrigue or suspense.There is a twist at the end, but it's 'too little too late', by this point i was only watching because i hadn't managed to find a rusty fork to stick in my eyeballs.Don't waste your time on this film, juggling 'rio snappers' would be more frightening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trailers for this movie made it look pretty good, but it turned out to be not the best movie. It delivers the scares, but there are too many 'false alarms'. A lot of the love stuff in the beginning could've been left out. The real horror starts a little too late, and basically is pretty corny. Most of the acting is pretty bad, and some of the dialogue seems to be totally improvised. This is one Japanese horror remake that shouldn't have been made at all in my opinion. It has a pretty bad plot that takes a long time to unfold and, at times, is rather boring. Warning - do not be fooled, for this is one movie that blows! If you want to see a movie, just avoid this, and see something else instead. Trust me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shutter starts as newlywed couple Ben (Joshua Jackson) &amp; Jane Shaw (Rachael Taylor) are driving along at night, suddenly Janes notices a women in the middle of the road &amp; hits her. Both Jane &amp; Ben search the area but find no-one, shortly after Ben who works as a photographer is given a job in Japan so both he &amp; Jane pack up &amp; move out there. After Ben's first photo shoot for an important client all the pictures come back with strange white, ghost like images on them which renders them useless. Ben thinks there's a technical problem with the equipment but Jane becomes convinced the pictures are spirit photo's, photograph's that capture the image of a ghost. Strange things begin to happen to Ben &amp; Jane &amp; soon they both believe they are being haunted by the girl that they ran over in New York but Jane decides to investigate &amp; discovers a shocking truth about Ben &amp; the girl who has been haunting them...Directed by Masayuki Ochiai this is an American remake of the Thai film Shutter (2004), while I have not seen the original Thai one it's probably a safe bet that it's better than this soft teen supernatural horror that is remarkable only for it's blandness. While I didn't think Shutter was the worst remake of a not as good as everyone makes out Asian horror I would have a hard time recommending it to anyone, having recorded it off cable telly &amp; having watched it for free at least I didn't spend any money on it. The script is fairly routine, some young happy American couple move to Japan &amp; are menaced by some ghostly girl with long black hair that covers her face, the looks &amp; sounds are also very familiar. As usual it all ties into some shocking past event that the leads have to investigate &amp; unravel, to be honest I didn't mind the ending that much &amp; although it does come across as a little bit silly I did like the dark idea of some guy being left a hunchback vegetable confined to a hospital room for the rest of his life. The basic plot about spirit photo's doesn't go anywhere &amp; in fact any serious exploration of the phenomena is abandoned after a couple of speeches by so called experts (wasn't it lucky that Jane showed those photo's to that Japanese girl whose boyfriend just happened to be the editor of a magazine about spirit photo's?) where Jane gets to look worried &amp; then the concept is merely used to show what the ghost is up to. Also, why did Adam jump out of his apartment window &amp; to his death? Was it guilt? He had never shown any guilt before. had he? Was he possessed? There's nothing else in the film to suggest possession so that's a little bit of a loose end for me. At just over 80 minutes at least it's short, it moves along at a reasonable pace with one or two decent enough moments but overall Shutter felt far too routine, bland &amp; uninspired.Available in both PG &amp; Unrated versions the Unrated cut doesn't feature any new violence or gore but instead some extra dialogue scenes that don't really add much (apart from a couple of minutes of running time). Like a lot of modern US horror Shutter was obviously intended for a teen audience &amp; as such with it's PG rating feels very tame, there's no real gore or violence &amp; only a couple of people die. Like the script the visual style of Shutter is also very bland &amp; forgettable, there are lots of plain whites, greys &amp; blacks which gives Shutter a very drab look.Filmed in Tokyo in Japan this did respectable business at the box-office taking over $25 million, the acting is alright &amp; the cast is cute enough but again it's pretty bland.Shutter isn't the worst remake out there but at the same time isn't very good, I did like the concept behind the twist ending although the execution wasn't entirely successful. Watchable in a short none offensive sort of way but I doubt I will remember anything about it in a few days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of the time I watch a movie that starts out awesome and dims down near the end. With Shutter, it's the other way around.Because, for the first 30 minutes I wasn't really impressed. Sure, a bunch of stuff happens and it's a nice story that goes on, but it's not really impressive. But as the movie progresses, so does the quality of the film.A photographer and his newly-wed wife accidentally hit a woman on a road at night. The woman then mysteriously disappears. Everything seems to be OK at first, but then strange things start to happen. Something seems to stalk the couple, by appearing in pictures. The photographer seems skeptic at first, but eventually agrees that something's not right. Together with his wife, he tries to understand and ultimately stop who or what is after them...More and more is revealed, and by the end you are on the edge of your seat. Truly, Shutter is a creepy, interesting movie.I had my doubts at first, but in the end I decided to keep Shutter in my collection. It's not the BEST movie of it's genre, but definitely interesting enough.7 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While on their honeymoon in Japan, a professional American photographer (Joshua Jackson) and his new bride (Rachel Taylor) run over a young woman who, for some inexplicable reason, just happens to be standing in the middle of a deserted country road in the dead of night. Soon, the victim - the obligatory pasty-faced, stringy-haired brunette in a nightie - is haunting the couple's pictures in the form of a "spirit photo," first hanging around the edges of the images, then - when the novelty of that wears off - appearing to the couple in corporeal form, and generally making a first-class nuisance of herself.As thrillers go, there are more shutters than shudders in this slick Hollywood remake of a well-received Thai film from 2004. The storyline and imagery in this version are so reminiscent of other films in the genre that I kept feeling, as I was watching it, that I had seen this exact same movie before (and, no, I haven't seen the original). The derivative nature of the film hampers our enjoyment of even the few moderately suspenseful scenes director Masayuki Ochiai has been able to wring out of this shopworn material. All told, the movie doesn't add up to much more than a handful of creepy photos combined with a soupcon of spirit-world hocus pocus - though the worm-turning twist ending is pretty darn satisfying, I must admit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the original Thai version of this movie before I watched this one so perhaps I'm a bit biased. I don't know why they decided to bring this version to Japan? They should've just kept the story in the United States. Taking it to Japan makes no sense.As with most of my reviews, the acting in this movie is good. It's a horror movie so you shouldn't expect a Forrest Gump performance. As long as the cast members don't sound like Ben Stein when they scream, I'm good with the acting.The atmosphere is well done too, although I think they should've kept the entire movie in the US. Maybe American's think Japan is a spookier place. I don't know...it was just really foolish of the writers to bring the characters to Japan.Compared to the Thai version of this title, this American version didn't summon much emotion out of me. I didn't feel bad for Megumi, I didn't feel bad for Ben, I didn't feel anger toward Ben's buddies. If a movie fails to get its viewer emotional, then it really has failed. And in my opinion, this movie failed.Whoever is reading this, if you have not seen either versions, please watch the American version before you watch the Thai version and let me know which you like better.** NOTE: I didn't write a review for the Thai version, but compared to the 5 stars I give here, I'd give the Thai version about a 7 or 8 **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another J-Horror remake? Truthfully? It's lacking "shudders"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a certain fashionable trait when it comes to J-Horror remakes. Bumps in the night, disturbing images and the most famous of all that same scary Japanese girl with the black hair covering her face. So it's no surprise that this latest revamp of the Korean chiller looks exactly the same ass all the ones that have been before. Only worse. Lacks the jump out of the seat horror of The Grudge, without the stunning atmosphere of the ring. No shutter takes its place in front of the Disaster of a film "One Missed Call" so bad you'd rather that very girl was haunting you simply to end the nightmare that is "Shutter" And yet with such a shimmering premise and an original that is remarkable at creating up scares it's a mystery why this did do too well. With One missed Call it was all out in the open. What with the Japanese original being far from brilliant. But here we have a brilliant premise, a decent cast and room for improvement. And yet it still managed to flop. Congratulation Hollywood you've done it again.For photographer Ben and his new wife Jane, his new assignment--a lucrative fashion shoot in Tokyo--was supposed to be a kind of working honeymoon. With this exotic professional opportunity and the limitless possibilities of a new marriage, Ben and Jane arrive in Japan.But as they make their way on a mountain road leading to Mt. Fuji, their new life together comes to, literally, a crashing halt. Their car smashes into a woman standing in the middle of the road, who has materialized out of nowhere. Upon regaining consciousness after the accident, Ben and Jane cannot find any trace of the girl Jane believes she hit with the car. Shaken by the accident and by the girl's disappearance, Ben and Jane arrive in Tokyo, where Ben begins his glamorous assignment. Having worked in Japan before and fluent in the language, Ben is comfortable there, and he eagerly reunites with old friends and colleagues.Jane, a newcomer to the city, feels very much like a stranger in a strange land as she makes tentative, unsettling forays through the city. Ben, meanwhile, has discovered mysterious white blurs--eerily evocative of a human form--that have materialized on an entire day's work from the expensive photo shoot. Jane's concerns escalate as she believes the blurs in Ben's photos are the dead girl from the road, who is now seeking vengeance for them leaving her to die.In all its merely an uninspired, freightless mess that nether inspires, incites of scares ultimately. Its half baked cliqued trash that deserves the be discarded as soon as possible.My final verdict? Avoid at all costs. Nobody will enjoy this and on the list of bad J-Horror this ranks second last behind the dreadful One Missed Call. The movies never seemed to have one full complete plot that lasted from the start to the end. Everything happened so fast, and was insanely unrealistic. It wasn't entertaining, scary, or interesting. "A classic dud."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You'll shutter when you see how horrible "Shutter" is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmmakers have been shooting movies about ghosts as far back as 1898 when Gallic director Georges Méli?s made "The Cave of the Demons," or as the French called it "La Caverne Maudite." Over a thousand movies since the Méli?s cinematic short have been made about ghosts. Clearly, unlike some genres and characters, the ghost in a horror movie has proved to be a profitable if not always artistically successful staple of movie makers.The new Joshua Jackson &amp; Rachael Taylor supernatural saga "Shutter" tries to imitate better Japanese horror thrillers like "The Ring" and "The Grudge." This tepid remake of the similarly titled 2004 Thailand tale of terror about a ghost bent on revenge lacks spirit. Incidentally, the American-made "Shutter" qualifies as the second remake behind the 2007 nail-biter produced in India as "Sivi." Unfortunately, Japanese director Masayuki Ochiai?making his English language film debut--scares up no memorable thrills or chills. If you've ever seen one Japanese chiller about a cadaverous, raven-haired dead girl in a shabby white dress that materializes and vanishes without a trace, then you are miles ahead of both Ochiai and sophomore scenarist Luke Dawson. Despite its attractive cast, atmospheric Nipponese locales, and lenser Katsumi Yanagijima's superlative cinematography, "Shutter" qualifies as a hopelessly predictable and dreadfully dull frightmare. Creeping along at a minimal 86 minutes, this Twentieth Century Fox release provides nothing that you haven't recoiled at in previous PG-13 rated ghost stories. Blood and gore are held to an absolute minimum. Although it wasn't designed to discriminate against American tourists in all likelihood, "Shutter" appears to be anti-American to the core. If you come to Japan, bad things will happen to you, especially if you take advantage of native girls.Newlyweds Jane (Rachael Taylor of "Transformers") and Ben (Joshua Jackson of "The Skulls") travel to Tokyo where Ben has been hired by his old friend Bruno (David Denman of "The Replacements") to shoot high quality fashion photography. Actually, Ben has lived in Japan before and speaks with language fluently which puts his wife Jane somewhat at a disadvantage. Everything is love-dovey until Ben lets Jane do the driving late one night down a dark, freezing, snow-swept two-lane blacktop highway. The wraith of a young woman (Megumi Okina of the original movie The Grudge") suddenly appears in Jane's headlights in the middle of nowhere, and our heroine slams into her. Reeling from the shock and the impact, Jane loses control of their automobile and crashes into tree. Afterward, our married couple inspects the asphalt but neither can find any traces of either blood or a body. Later, when the authorities arrive, they cannot find anything. They believe Jane struck an animal and the beast fled into the darkness to die. Nevertheless, Jane cannot shake the eerie feeling that she really did hit a woman.Not surprisingly, inexplicable things begin to occur to our twosome. Jane awakens from a nightmares about the accident, while Ben suffers from a pain in the neck. A doctor prescribes a pain-killer, but the medication has little effect. In an otherwise light-hearted scene, Ben programs his camera to snap pictures of Jane and him standing in front of Japan's breath-taking Mt. Fuji. When Jane and Ben look at the photos, they spot a smear of blinding white light on them. Of course, literal minded Ben contends that either he loaded the film improperly or the roll was defective when he bought it. Later, when Ben is shooting some expensive fashion stills, the same ghostly streaks mar his photos and he fears that he will lose his job because the budget cannot accommodate retakes. One of Ben's Japanese female assistants, Seiko (Maya Hazen), takes Jane to see her ex-boyfriend who runs a magazine devoted to 'spirit-photography' or pictures of ghosts. Interestingly, Ritsuo (James Kyson Lee), the editor of a magazine that publishes phony pictures of poltergeist phenomenon explains to Jane that the surest way to make certain that ghost streaks in a photo are genuine is to take pictures with a Polaroid camera. Since the picture is developed immediately, Ritsuo points out that the image couldn't have been tampered with by anybody. Jane takes his advice and sure enough she has a close encounter with this female ghost. Nothing that Jane can say, however, alters Ben's sense of disbelief.Things grow progressively worse as the evil she ghost attacks one of Ben's friends Adam (John Hensley of Fox TV's "Nip/Tuck") and he dies under mysterious circumstances. Eventually, after Jane decides that she does believe in the supernatural, she has to wonder why this Japanese girl is attacking the men that work in Ben's photography studio. By this time, you'll figure out for yourself the scandal that happened and everything boils down to an ordinary murder mystery so predictable that "Shutter" doesn't have a ghost of a chance of either surprising or shocking you with its revelation. What's really incredible about this botched effort is that Japanese director Masayuki Ochiai blew it as badly as he did. Ochiai made an impressive horror movie in 2004 called "Infection" that has been available for rental in the United States. Granted, "Infection" contains more blood and gore than "Shutter," but "Infection" also generates a great deal of suspense and tension.Altogether, "Shutter" is a utter waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How average can one movie get...???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...very.American couple moves to Tokyo where they are terrorized by a ghostly Japanese girl who keeps appearing in their photos.I went to see Shutter with absolutely zero expectations and it's probably a good thing I did because I would have likely hated this movie otherwise. Much like its tailer suggests Shutter is another one of those Japanese supernatural horror films remade for America - very much in vein of The Ring and The Grudge, but not as effectively chilling as either of those movies. The story is pretty routine, the 'scares' are generally typical clichés, and the over all movie is underwhelming. It's basically another formula supernatural horror film that could really use a bigger dose of imagination.But despite all of its predictability, Shutter had a few good points that kept it from being a complete waste. Joshua Jackson did a decent performance and was the biggest highlight of the cast. There was a couple of effectively creepy scenes involving the evil dead girl menacing Jackson in his sleep. Finally, the conclusion of the movie actually wasn't bad and I dare say it was a bit darkly humorous.So all around, Shutter doesn't impress, but you could do worse.** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was THE WORST in a while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was absolutely one of THE WORST movies I have seen in a long time. I went to the theater so I can see a nice scary film... definitely did not get that. The entire plot was so predictable and I literally sat there telling what would happen next without seeing it. It was not scary, the plot was terrible, and the ending was bad as well. The acting was decent, but in general the movie just wasn't good! I would not recommend this movie to anyone at all. I hate to be so pessimistic about the movie, but it really just was that bad! Take the $10 or so you would have spent on this movie and donate it to the American Cancer Society..the movie is just not worth it. EXTREMELY disappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little bit of everything.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, I never saw the original.However, the trailer for this looked somewhat promising than a few other horror movie remakes. So I decided to watch it with a few friends. So five minutes into the movie. Nothing new. Ten more minutes into the movie. Nothing new. Thirty minutes... and so on, and so on.Everything in the movie seems just to be a re-hash of the other movies (it's somewhat understandable, as this is from similar producers), but the fact that a lot of the scenes (majority =P) were very generic was just a negative.There were probably one or two memorable scenes or elements, but that is it. At best, the movie is okay... And just for the record, One Missed Call had more creepy scenes than this flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why was this movie even made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shutter seemed like a promising horror flick. I saw The Grudge (American) when it came out and thought it had something to offer my kind of crowd, the college moviegoer. I was expecting for this film to have the same effect. Unfortunately, I think that the best thing about this movie was the trailer, and after finding out that this was a remake, I have to ask why was this movie even made? Was it only made because we can't read (subtitles) and watch at the same time? Without seeing the original, I can only guess that it is better. The Shutter remake had all the potential to be a great scary movie. It had the creepy music, lighting, and ghosts. It also had a very interesting theme of incorporating a vengeful spirit into photographs that definitely worked better than the whole "noise" concept of the movie White Noise. (Shutter remake is definitely better than White Noise.) However, the concept was not original to this film, and therefore, they really didn't need to remake a movie so soon after the original (if at all). The effects in this movie were probably a little bit more enhanced, but it's nothing I haven't seen before. They definitely weren't on the level of The Grudge (maybe budget constraints?)I don't think the actors and actresses stood out at all in this movie. You'll think Rachel Taylor is beautiful and Joshua Jackson plays his part well, but they're just blah. Their chemistry is blah. Their performances are blah. You could replace them with another actor and actress, and it wouldn't make a difference. I just felt like they could have done a lot more. It didn't scare me nearly as much as I would have liked it too. It was enjoyable to a point, but my friend and I both had to ask, was that it? I thought the ending was a bit contrived, maybe because I already gathered everything I needed to know from the trailer so the "twist" was just as predictable as everything else. They needed to do a lot more with Joshua Jackson's character in my opinion to put this movie over the edge, and they failed to do that. So basically, this film will scare the younger crowd. In fact I think that's why it's PG-13 rated to get kids in the theater and make a buck. It's not going to do anything for anyone who is wanting something more than The Grudge. It'll creep you out a little but its style and concept is predictable and nothing new.Overall, 6/10 for me for its average horror movie appeal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior Spooky Horror Flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fairly engrossing ghost/horror movie and is far better that many people have opined. A professional photographer is newly married.He is on assignment in Japan with his wife and bizarre events happen with his photographing which gradually spiral out of control in a supernatural and murderous way. The two main leads Joshua Jackson and Rachael Taylor are excellent and give convincing and compelling performances. As the story reaches its climax all makes sense in the context of the kind of film this is, and throughout the picture there are some genuinely scary moments.Worthy of at least:7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing horror movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two good reasons to watch this movie: 1) Joshua Jackson is extremely hot and good to look at (okay, I admit it, I'm a fan!). 2) Rachel Taylor does a good job in this role with the material she had to work with. Aside from that, I honestly can't really recommend this movie. I was expecting, given the rating, this movie to be scary and/or gory but it really wasn't either of those things. I'm a pretty squirmish person, so I was even surprised at how 'tame' I thought this movie was in the end. I guess I was expecting more, as the actual premise is quite good, but for whatever reason it just didn't quite work in this version. Now I haven't seen the original version to compare, but this movie wouldn't inspire me to, either. Disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reminiscent of the Grudge?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...Yes. In fact, so many of the scenarios seemed taken right out of the Grudge. Ghost in bed. Ghost under table. Ghost crawls around, scaring people. Even in the photos, I could help but think of the "Shutter" ghost's counterpart. They had the cute young American couple, complete with the blonde bimbo of a wife (ahem: Sarah Michelle Gellar's replacement). Also, the horror was so overdone! I wanted to laugh at each jumpy scene, because it was not scary or nerve-racking in the slightest, but the moronic junior high kids next to me kept on shrieking. Basically, the movie's over-rated. Try something else. Something original, maybe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm tired of this already.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was between this and Meet the Browns. And since I had only seen Diary of a Mad Black Woman, I caught the 10:15 showing at my local theater. It was packed! But yet, i don't know why. The movie was terrible. Well, all you need to know about this film is that there are ghosts in the pictures. That's it. The acting is tasteless, and the haunting sound effects and music fit the mood, but doesn't help this film. In some points in the film, the pictures will creep you out. But this wont give you nightmares, unlike The Exorsict. This film, of course is a Remake of another film of the same name. Just like The Eye. Stay away from this one, at best, its a rental. But to pay money to watch it in theaters,no.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wouldn't say awful, but awful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a total disaster. I had expected much out of this movie since it claimed to be a horror/thriller, and was everything else but that.I've seen better movies with quality horror content and this definitely is not one of them. The plot begins well, but its done badly after wards. So, if you're eager to watch this, better wait for something else.The concept of this movie has been used in many other movies too, and some of them have (pardon the pun) "clicked". It seems like they haven't given enough thought into making this movie. You can actually tell that in some places where the pace of the story is uneven, some events jump ahead.There are a couple of scenes where its actually scary. But its just a few. The acting isn't done too well and overall the movie isn't good enough. Some of the "horrifying" scenes aren't actually scary.So, finally, I wouldn't recommend it, unless you wanna catch the comical side of a horror/thriller movie.</fullReview>

At least for a scare.BUT BOY, WAS I WRONG! It sucked. Don't waste your money or time with this audacity of a movie. I was at the point where if it didn't end, Iwas going to hang myself. Don't even bother with "Shutter" (aka Crueland Unusual Torture)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie Ever!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People please save your money and don't see this movie. It's absolutely horrible and so cliché. The script seems like it took all of 3 minutes to write. Whats up with these ghost that all look Japanese(The Grudge anyone?).Haven't we seen this enough. And these ghost that appear for no reason only to find the husband had an affair with the woman and treated her wrong and that's why she haunting people.(What Lies Beneath anyone?).We've seen this countless times and it never stops it seems. And whoever wrote this script knows this. This is why the quality in movies are going down because of horrid movies such as this. When you watch a movie like "No Country For Old Men" you think Hollywood is getting back on track, then you see a movie like this and all your hopes turn to sand. Please don't waste your time or money going to see this people.</fullReview>
