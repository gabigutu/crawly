		<shortDescription>One of the very best alien invasion movies...it still is!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You gotta love the '70's! It was really the golden age of cinema. '70's movies were real, gritty, they had a sense of realism, had an unusual and often revolutionary style of movie-making. Many of the best movies ever made are from the '70's. Not sure if "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" classifies as one of THE best movies ever but it certainly is one of the very best alien invasion movies ever made and therefor remains still one of the very best movies out of its genre.The realism turns out to be a perfect combination with the horror and science-fiction elements in the movie. It makes the movie haunting and makes us really feel with all of the characters. Their fear becomes sensible and their actions understandable. Nothing 'big' or 'impressive' is ever shown and very little is explained in the movie. The movie and how the events unravel are totally told from the main characters view point. None of the main characters are 'heroes' and instead they are just normal every day persons. Those two elements are the main reason why this movie is so realistic and haunting to watch. It also is the reason why alien invasion movies made present day fail to impress ("Independence Day", Spielberg's "War of the Worlds") They are all told 'big', with special effects and lots of violence with big name actors in them. They are made for entertainment and most of them surely also work well as entertainment, especially in my opinion "Independence Day" which I, unlike many others, find to be a very entertaining and good movie to watch. Those movies are surely good and entertaining enough and its not the cast or crews fault that those recent movies fail to impress the general audience, it's just that those movies were made in the wrong decade and it misses the '70's touch that makes the movies so gritty, raw and realistic to watch."Invasion of the Body Snatchers" is told slow and things happen in a low pace. Since nothing is really explained as the movie unravels, you never really fully understand what is happening and why. It gives the movie an almost paranoid kind of atmosphere, which helps to make this movie more of an horror movie than a science-fiction movie, even though the story itself is obviously fictional. The story to be honest is quite far fetched and perhaps even ridicules at moments but due to the realistic and slow way it is told, none of this matters. It helps to make this movie one of the most haunting ones ever created, also due to its unforgettable haunting ending that is one of the very best out of cinema history, it really is!The typical unusual '70's cinematography is from Michael Chapman. Leave it up to Chapman to give a movie a realistic look and feeling. ("Taxi Driver", "Raging Bull", "The Fugitive")The cast of the movie is great. Like every good genre movie from the '70's, it has Donald Sutherland in the main lead. He plays an average, not perfect guy, which again adds to the realism and our involvement with the character. Other fine roles are being played by Veronica Cartwright, Leonard Nimoy and Jeff Goldblum in one of his first really big role."Invasion of the Body Snatchers" is way more than just another average, unlikely alien invasion movie. It's brilliantly told, crafted, acted, thoughtful, haunting and realistic. '70's film-making at its very best and it makes this movie still one of the very best out of its genre.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eerie, Suspenseful &amp; 'Classy' Horror/Sci-Fi Effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a solid horror/sci-fi story with good production values. Those values include outstanding direction by Philip Kaufman, camera-work by Michael Chapman and acting. The cast of main characters was comprised of Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, Leonard Nimoy, Jeff Goldblum and Veronica Cartwright. Of the group, Sutherland had the most lines and was the most impressive. All of it added up to a pretty classy film, a lot more than you'd except reading the movie title. There was some profanity and nudity so maybe it wasn't totally classy, but the profanity was light and the nudity was a few shots of Adams' breasts. The movie clicked because it built up the suspense beautifully, and proved you don't need a lot of violence and gore to scare the viewer. Too bad modern filmmakers of horror films can't seem to understand that. In fact the scariest thing of the movie - and it WAS scary - might have been the eerie noises emanating from the "re-born" humans.The photography is good and I loved the facial closeups and interesting camera angles. The film is a visual treat. The original film in 1956 is a good one but it's generally conceded this re-make is superior. The star of that first film, by the way - Kevin McCarthy, makes a cameo appearance in here. That was a nice touch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent remake of the 1950s paranoid classic. ALMOST as good as the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 'Invasion Of The Body Snatchers' is one of my favourite thrillers of all time, and a very hard movie to top. I'm always sceptical about remakes of classic horror and SF films, but this version by Philip Kaufman is much better than one would expect, and ALMOST as good as the original. I still think Don Siegel's version is the best because it really evokes small town life in middle America, and that makes the horror and suspense all the more effective. Kaufman transplants the setting to San Francisco and the big city location means it loses its sense of intimacy and community, and instead has more of an alienated urban feel to it. But it's still an excellent movie, and along with Cronenberg's 'The Fly' and Carpenter's 'The Thing' the most successful remake of a 1950s horror classic to date. What really helps this movie is the cast. Donald Sutherland, one of the 1970s most interesting and intelligent actors, is excellent in the main role, played by Kevin McCarthy in the first film. And the lovely Brooke Adams ('Days Of Heaven', 'The Dead Zone', 'The Unborn') is first rate as the main female lead, her role being much more substantial than Dan Wynter's in the original. I've had a major crush on Adams ever since I first saw this movie. She is beautiful but goofy and I really thought she was going to be a major star. The supporting cast is excellent, led by the wonderful Jeff Goldblum and 'Alien's Veronica Cartwright, and of course Leonard Nimoy, in his most memorable non-Trek role. Also keep an eye out for cameos by the star and director of the original version (Kevin McCarthy and Don 'Dirty Harry' Siegel), and a very brief but eerie one by Robert Duvall! 'Invasion Of The Body Snatchers' is a superb example of how to remake a horror classic, and is one of the creepiest and most nerve-wracking thrillers of the 1970s. I highly recommend it and the original 'Body Snatchers', they are two of the scariest movies ever made!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Close enough to get a cigar, but not as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shortly after Elizabeth Driscoll (Brooke Adams) discovers a strange plant in her San Francisco-area yard that she cannot identify, her boyfriend begins acting strangely--he looks the same, but Elizabeth swears he's a different person. Before long, more and more people are claiming the same thing about their friends and relatives. Just what is going on? Although not quite as good as the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), this remake is very interesting and well worth a watch. Some things it does better than the original, although slightly more is not done as well. But it is full or intriguing ideas, some beautiful cinematography, and quite a few quirky charms.One oddity about this film is that it seems to assume that very few people will watch who aren't already familiar with the original. Scripter W.D. Richter and director Philip Kaufman give away the "twist" immediately, and there are a number of statements from characters in this film (such as the first time we hear the advice to not fall asleep) that only make sense if one already knows from Don Siegel's original just why they shouldn't fall asleep. For this reason, I strongly recommend that anyone interested in this film who hasn't seen it yet should make sure they watch the original first.The opening shots, which firmly set this remake into sci-fi territory, are a great idea, even if the execution is somewhat questionable. I'm not sure that Kaufman's "art gel" works, and the way it moves through space, as if blown by trade winds, is slightly hokey. But I'm willing to forgive a misstep if it's in service of a great idea, and especially if the misstep is the result of budgetary limitations.Early in the film, the major asset is the cinematography. There is an excellent, slow tracking shot down a hallway, where we only see our main character by way of her feet and a slight reflection in a window. There are a lot of great "tilted" shots. There are a lot of subtle lighting effects to set mood, and a just as many subtle instances of symbolism for the horrors to come.The cast, featuring Adams, Donald Sutherland, Jeff Goldblum, Leonard Nimoy and Veronica Cartwright, is an interesting combination of stars who tend to give idiosyncratic performances. Kaufman exploits the collection of personalities well, although occasionally gives us odd "everyone talk at once" scenes which can verge on the brink of annoying. Although I'm not usually the biggest fan of Goldblum (in some roles, such as The Fly, I like him, in some roles he tends to irritate me), I noted an odd similarity between him in this film and an actor and performance I'm much more fond of--David Duchovny and his X-Files character Fox Mulder.Speaking of that, there is a strong X-Files vibe to this film overall. Whereas the original Invasion had thinly veiled subtexts of fear and doubts of "The Other"--whether politically-rooted (the common analysis is that the original Invasion was a subtext for U.S. fears of communism), religiously-rooted (some see it as a parable about cults, or religions in general) or simply about personal identity (in a philosophical sense of "Who am I/are you?" "What makes one oneself?"), Kaufman's take has stronger subtexts of encroaching mental illness--fear of losing one's mind and a generalized, "clinical" paranoia.Given that difference, it's perhaps odd that there are so many similarities between the two films. The character structure and relationships are largely the same, with some mostly insignificant differences, including slightly different occupations. There are many scenes taken almost verbatim from the original film, often only with differences of setting, but staged the same, with similar scenarios and occasionally identical dialogue. There is even a wonderful moment where Kevin McCarthy, star of the original film, comes running down the street, screaming that we're all doomed.A number of quirky moments push the value of Kaufman's film up a notch. These are sprinkled throughout the film, but some highlights are a Robert Duvall cameo as a priest inexplicably on a swingset next to toddlers, the "mud bath" parlor, a brief spurt of marvelous, Zappa-sounding avant-garde classical as we witness a chase down a staircase, and a greenhouse in a shipping yard, through which Elizabeth eventually strolls naked, casually walking by employees. The "creature" effects may be better here than in the original, but they are not more effective for that.But overall, this is a great film. Just make sure you don't miss the superior original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"They grow out of those PODS!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSEven more than the original film, which channeled a mounting zeitgeist of suspicion in a way that some found to be vaguely reminiscent of McCarthyism, the 1978 "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" relies on a paranoia that was distinctly related to the 1970s. In other words, it's re-envisioned as my favorite genre of all: what I call the "70s Doom Film"."Invasion of the Body Snatchers" presents an adventure that has few equals in movies of this type, an adventure that finds our main characters staying awake together at night, dashing down dark alleys and hiding behind shipping crates, whisking away in taxicabs, and hiding under desks in darkened offices after hours. Philip Kaufman has given us a vision of an entire city gradually giving way to a conspiracy helmed by extraterrestrial plant life that has randomly fallen from the sky to take root on the Earth, duplicating human beings (and destroying them in the process). The reason this movie is so effective, and one of the reasons why I love it so much, is that the characters are all lovably odd. Donald Sutherland's Matthew seems like a real stone-faced health inspector who berates a snobbish restaurateur about finding a "rat turd" in the grain, until you see him talking to Elizabeth and cracking jokes about the job. Elizabeth, played by the wonderful Brooke Adams, is a little offbeat, laughing nervously a lot and rolling her eyes in a bizarre manner. Jack and Nancy Bellicec (Jeff Goldblum and Veronica Cartwright) are completely off-the-wall, Jack being the tortured poet and Nancy buying into outlandish theories of alien colonization and health food while compulsively reading novels written by authors who were more than likely tripping on acid. We believe them as odd but genuine characters in real situations, particularly the touching romance between Elizabeth and Matthew. Specifically, they are people with oddball characteristics in danger of having those differences stripped bare by the alien pod life. This film is a real credit to all of the talent involved in it.The tense and increasingly grim third act finds our heroes on the run from people whom they may have suspected all along of wanting to harm them. Shots of prowling police are interspersed with seemingly ordinary people who have suddenly taken on an ominous attitude. The fact that a good portion of it takes place without dialog shouldn't be a liability, but it is here that the film begins to bog down a bit, and I think it's because Kaufman so effectively portrays the exhaustion of the characters that this begins to transfer to the audience as well. Like the contagious quality of a yawn, the desperation that Matthew and Elizabeth feel becomes pervasive.What seals this movie's place in history as something that freaked a lot of people out in the 70s is the fact the conclusion is so downbeat and agonizingly bleak. There is no happy ending for anybody; the characters we grow to like are systematically worn down until their fight is gone and their very need to sleep forces them to succumb. The tragedy of Elizabeth's conversion to a pod seems very real, especially when we see her soulless clone rising up out of the weeds like an ugly vine. The starkness of her nudity, and the utter disregard that the other pods have for it, strikes at a bleakness that is far more terrifying than anything else in the film. Likewise, the final confrontation between the converted Matthew and the still-human Nancy is chilling not only because of the horrendous scream that she is met with, but also because of the naiveté that does her in. As she crosses the street, you can see her smiling at Matthew in a conspiratorial way, never dreaming that he could have become a pod himself. The way his face morphs into the grimace of one of the pod people represents a betrayal of the worst kind. It suggests the very real fear that even our most trusted friends and lovers can suddenly become different overnight, turning on us for reasons unknown.Kaufman's dark fantasy has tapped into these emotions with stunning ease, and he has created a beautiful, heartbreaking, and lyrical film that is loaded with good stuff. Any serious fan of film or the horror/sci-fi genre in particular should find this a really witty, funny, and sometimes horrifying experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Filmed nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film in a movie theater at midnight, as part of an October horror-movie festival. I almost didn't go; I had always had this movie figured as another stupid Hollywood remake of a great film from the past, and thought they were probably only showing it instead of the original because of that weird, vague prejudice against black and white movies that still for some reason permeates this country, even though the novelty of color wore off about forty years ago. But I figured what the hell, it wouldn't hurt to check it out, and when will I get a chance to see any of these movies in a theater again? So I went, and was almost immediately sucked in by the mind-bending direction and the terrific acting. But not only that; it was after midnight, remember, and I was getting sleepy, and I found myself in that kind of hypnotized, pseudo-dreaming state you can get into when you're watching a movie really late at night. I was really into the movie, mind you, but it was like a dream, I wasn't wholly conscious. And just as I was at my most out-of-it, as I was almost technically asleep, the movie hit me with that last shot, you know the one I mean, and jolted me wide awake like a bucket of ice water. It was just like waking up from a nightmare. I thought I was gonna start crying. I haven't been that freaked out by a movie since I was a little kid. As the end credits rolled and the house lights came up, I heard some other people in the theater talking about what a stupid movie it was, man, was that a waste of money, I'm glad it was only three-fifty, and it was a really surreal moment; I've just had one of the most horrifying moments of my waking life, and they're talking about how silly it was (although, truthfully, they may have been a little shaken up themselves and just covering for it, I dunno). A week or so later I was talking about it with my dad, who had seen it when it came out, and I mentioned the ending, and he did a dead-on mimic of the last shot, and I said "God! Don't do that!" I was STILL shaken up by this movie.There aren't a lot of movies that even try to be frightening--most horror movies (and novels and so on) actually have other concerns: being funny, or shocking, or gory, or surprising, or bizarre, or whatever--and even fewer actually pull it off, actually scare you. Man, does this one pull it off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Invasion of the Body Snatcher (1978)The original 1950s version of this movie is such a favorite of mine, I hesitated to watch this one. But fear not. This is great, too. It's got the same theme, but very richly and creatively rendered, some superb photography, great night stuff, and most importantly, great acting by the key 3 or 4 people.Director Philip Kaufman works sporadically as director and writer (he hit it big with "Raiders of the Lost Ark") and he clearly has a unique and somewhat fearless vision that remains rooted in Hollywood sensibilities. That is, this is no independent film, yet it's creative.And it's scary. Between the development of fear over the actual biological invasion, and the old fashioned chase and hide sequences, this is a tense movie. But yet it's convincing, given the realistic, nuanced acting by the main couple, Donald Sutherland (as a Health Department official) and Brooke Adams (as a lab analyst in the same department). Of course, what happens isn't believable at all, somehow, but it's so close to feasible, and in fact so close to what we live with already (some people without feelings, out for themselves, part of a conspiracy, etc.), it isn't hard to pull it off.Cinematographer Michael Chapman is about as good as it gets in the Hollywood vein, polished and with amazing, varied lighting (he also did "Raging Bull," "The Fugitive," and "Taxi Driver," for starters). So this movie works on every level. The one thing it isn't, of course, is original, but as a remake, we have to take it for how it handles it, 1970s style. Impressive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent take on a brilliant story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phillip Kaufman's adaptation of Jack Finney's classic novel had a lot to live up to after the classic 1956 take on it - and I think it lived up to expectations. Though not as great as the more politically orientated original, Kaufman's film is still a lesson in suspense and the central story has lost none of the intrigue that it captured in the original. The story follows an alien life form that has come from outer space and taken residence here on earth. Not content with living in sibilance with humans, the aliens become 'body snatchers' and make duplications of people while they're sleeping. These duplicates take the original host's place and are everything their originals were, only all forms of emotion vanish. Our story takes focus on Martin and Elizabeth, two workers at the US Health Department. After taking home a supposedly new type of flower, Elizabeth finds her boyfriend acting strangely and later discovers that she's not the only one with relatives who aren't quite themselves...This film works because of a constant sense of paranoia. In the 1950's, this was tied in with the then 'reds under the beds' idea of communism spreading through capitalist America. This film seems to have dispensed with that idea, which gives way to more opportunity for sci-fi horror, which is more than welcome in my opinion. The special effects on display are bold and lavish, and therefore exciting to watch. They are a little hokey, but still not bad at all - the parts where you see the alien duplicate forming are fantastically gruesome, and also rather frightening. The whole idea of the film is frightening, even in spite of the fact that it ever happening is very unlikely. The idea that an alien race can take over almost an entire city in one night, and without anyone realising it, is not one that I'd like to have if I was a paranoid conspiracy theorist! Then there's the notion that they'll get you if you sleep as it's like one man in the film says..."gotta sleep sometime". Invasion of the Body Snatchers is also notable for featuring a great cast, which not only includes the excellent Donald Sutherland and the beautiful Brooke Adams, but also Jeff Goldblum (in his first of two successfully good remakes) and Leonard Nimoy, a.k.a. Captain Spock from Star Trek. Also watch out for cameos from original Invasion of the Body Snatchers director Don Siegel and said film's star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story we have here, filmed once before in 1956 (I haven't seen that version) and once again later, in 1994, is so strong and thought-provoking that even a just-adequate film based on it would be quite effective. This 1978 remake goes beyond "just-adequate", though. It's a creepy, scary chiller, and also one of the most intellectual films of this genre I've ever seen. Maybe it lags in a few places, but excellent performances, methodical direction and a LITERALLY chilling finale make it first-class entertainment. (***)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Few Good Remakes- A Sci-Fi Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Invasion of the Body Snatchers is the remake of 1956 movie by the same title and considered to be, by many fans, to be the definitive and the best version of the story.The movie begins with images of plasmas from an alien world floating out into space towards planet earth. Then the rain comes and we see an odd organism growing on plants' leafs. Before too long, people start to act strange, they group and exchange plants, they act indifferent to their surroundings, they are emotionless, almost robotic. A group of characters who are not affected soon find themselves a minority in a world that is changing rapidly.One of the greatest appeals of this movie is its socio-political resonance. It can be interpreted as a state of minority versus majority, us versus them and individualism versus social conformity. It shows how we try to turn the others into a version of ourselves because we can't tolerate the otherness. And maybe this is a universal common trait of all beings whether alien or human. Even though the commentary is about humans, it is actually alien organism that takes over human bodies (snatches human bodies - hence body snatchers).The movie also questions how much we should sacrifice to achieve harmony in society. Should we preserve our individuality at risk of conflicting with other members of the society, or should we just join the majority, think like others, walk like others and talk like others do? Like all great science fiction movies, the story is social commentary on the state of the world. This is probably the reason why there are so many versions of this movie. And most recently in 2007, another version was made called "The Invasion" starring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake of the great story of the original is definitely worth a lot of recognition. It keeps the original story line and stays quite close to it but adding a few great things such as the ending. It stays very thrilling and exciting throughout the whole movie. It may seem a little old fashioned when watching it nowadays but the tension makes up for that. The only thing that seems a little strange is when he tries to destroy the factory and it seems like he succeeds doing so because it appears a little exaggerated in my opinion. Still I personally love the dark ending, you really wouldn't expect it and to me it's the most powerful possibility for ending this movie. So if you're in for some chilling tension and enjoy movies like Alien this is just right for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effectively Atmospheric Sci-Fi Horror Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is an absolute classic and is one of my all time Favourites. This is a perfect example of a great Film it has a good story and good acting and some good special effects. I feel that this film is actually a little Underrated because it does not get talked about enough now a days and it deserves to get talked about more. I do feel that the older films are better than the newer films and this film holds up to this day. The film was Made in the 70s and I could watch it over and over again because of the great story and great actors involved. The story is about spores that fall from space and take root in San Francisco and they change into strange flowers but we soon find out these flowers have the power to clone people and dispose of the original bodies which is a creepy idea. This is without a doubt one of the best Alien invasion movies I've ever seen. The movie has a dark brooding atmosphere throughout and there is a sense of realism in this film.I've always found older films to be more realistic and the good acting helps obviously. The film has the perfect Paranoid atmosphere and good music and it just works so well. Most sci-fi films now a days can't do what this film did they cannot create the paranoid foreboding atmosphere that this film had,Some can but not many. One by one the people of San Francisco get replaced by pod people and I liked how Brooke Adams started to notice that things in town were not right she could sense it and she knew the people were not normal and her and Donald work together and figure out what's going on. This film Is just so well made well written and well directed and I cannot say enough good things about it.I liked the main five characters a lot and I cared about what happened to them and that's because they were likable and had good character development. Donald Sutherland was great as the main character he was very likable and strong and gave a great performance. Brooke Adams Looks stunning in this film and her character was likable. Jeff Goldblum Veronica Cartwright and Leonard Nimoy were all good in the film and I enjoyed watching them together in this classic. This film has some very memorable scenes in it.one scene that I loved was when Donald fell asleep in the garden and the Alien pods started opening all around him and I have to say those pods looked great the effects were Awesome and the scene itself was creepy and chilling and the sound effects were good too which adds to the suspense. I liked how our main characters had to work together to fight all the pod people I found that entertaining stuff and the last 20 minutes of the film were intense and exciting. There are some really exciting chance scenes at the end of the film I also thought Donald Sutherland kicked a lot of Ass in this Film and he was Fun to watch. The film has many chilling and creepy scenes most memorable the Ending which I won't spoil. The only negative thing I can say about the film is it has a couple of slow spots but other than that I have no problems with the film and everything else works well. This Film is a classic and one of the best Sci-Fi films as well as one of the best remakes I've Ever seen. If you have not seen this film definitely give it a Watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>She Was Correct! (This time.)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite sci-fi/horror hybrid movie.I agree with Pauline Kael who said it is "The best science fiction movie ever made." It's flawless. Donald Sutherland has never been better. Jeff Goldblum was allowed to be as unhinged as possible. Brooke Adams is absolutely lovely. Cute as a button, and those eyes! How she does that 'trick" with rolling her eyes is a mystery to me. And Veronica Cartwright was as loony as she was in "Alien." She's terrific. It's creepy, which is much more effective than "scary." Yet when it wants to, it can scare the pants off you. (Think of the banjo player and his dog.) There's little things that require repeat viewings; such as all the garbage trucks, or people behind translucent glass doors simply watching as Sutherland and Adams talk in a hallway. The weird floor polisher, who just happens to be Michael Chapman, the film's cinematographer. Its cameos are so clever, they're brilliant. Kevin McCarthy screaming "You're next!" obviously recalls the later-added bumpers from the original. And Don Seigel even plays an odd cab driver! I love it. I like Philip Kaufman's other movies, but he never made another film as perfect as this. To paraphrase Ms. Kael, it's as close to perfect as a movie can get.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies get branded in your head, they're so searing. Phil Kaufman's version of the Jack Finney novel is just such a film. I remember approximately where I was sitting with my girl friend (I remember her name too) in the Fox Theatre in Spokane in the spring of 1979. I remember reading about the secrecy surrounding the film in the science magazine published by that sleazoid founder of Penthouse. I remember thinking that this is not going to end well.And I was right.I think IOTBS is the perfect apocalypse movie, several cuts above The Omega Man or Colossus: The Forbin Project. Because of two things, I make this claim. First, the ending leaves us without any hope, not a shred of belief that humanity will somehow survive. It's like On the Beach, only without the radioactive fallout. I left the theatre not glum or dispirited, but in sheer awe of how Homo Sapien Sapien had had a going out of business sale.The second reason is that Kaufman took the time to breathe life into the characters. The grief felt by the audience over the loss of people they cared about walked hand and hand with the astonishment that we all were finished. Kaput. Won't see ya later, 'gator! Seeing Brooke Adams' body collapse as Donald Sutherland tries to wake her, and his horrified wail is just one of the images I won't ever let go. Even the tiny bits stayed--Leonard Nimoy sliding into a car with another baddie and croaking, "The sooner, the better." Totally devoid of emotion; utterly alien; spot on.Kaufman's version is also several cuts above the Don Siegel pretty darned scary original from 1956, but that's not fair. Siegel was hemmed in by the production code and '50s sensibilities, plus the studio making the original thought audiences would stay away from a downer. Siegel shot it, but then had to shoot additional footage that gave the audience hope. The endings of these two films are so different, it's almost as if they aren't related. One was a metaphor for a burgeoning Communist conspiracy; the other was totally straightforward--aliens land, and we lose.We lose big.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams discover their friends are being taking over by cold human-duplicates</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the second adaptation , still very scary and eerie , about vintage novel deals with San Francisco residents who are being replaced by duplicates hatched from weird pods . It creates an altering the human behaviour in the new invaders. Meanwhile a doctor (top-notch Donald Sutherland) must protect his helper ( significant role for Brooke Adams) and soon aware that pods from outer space are duplicating and replacing everyone there . The doctor may hold the means to avoid the extraterrestrial invasion . The mysterious epidemic from outer space is spread her friends (Art Hindle, Jeff Goldblum , Leonard Nimoy) and San Francisco people , everybody are being take over by emotionless , cold behaving . The mysterious seeds from outer space are growing and destroying San Francisco Bay Area at an alarming attack.This scary Sci-Fi displays a tense screenplay based on Jack Finney novel titled ¨Body snatchers¨ that can be considered truly disturbing . Packs suspense, chills , thrills, spectacular scenes and pretty turns and twists . Good performances from Donald Sutherland and Veronica Cartwight who subsequently acted in the last version , besides important cameo role by Kevin McCarthy , Donald Siegel and can be glimpsed Robert Duvall . Appropriately rare and frightening musical score by Denny Zeitlin at his last soundtrack . Very good cinematography by the magnificent cameraman John A Alonzo . The motion picture is professionally directed by Philip Kauffman , with great originality in spite of being a remake .Other versions about this known story are the following : the classic adaptation which emerged as a cinema classic directed by Donald Siegel(1956) with Kevin McCarthy , Carolyn Jones and Dana Wynter, concerning about mysterious seeds duplicating people , it has emerged as a cinema classic that brings astonishing nightmares ; and inferior rendition in which the horror is diminished by Abel Ferrara(1994) that takes place in a military base with Forrest Whitaker , Meg Tilly, Terry Kenney and Gabriella Anwar. Lately recent version that results to be the least satisfactory titled ¨Invasion¨ with Daniel Craig, Nicole Kidman , Jeffrey Wrhight and directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel . Rating : Better than average . Worthwhile watching .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most underrated films of my life. It will scare the daylights out of you, not just because of the story but because of the characters. The characters, especially Donald Southerland, just get under your skin the entire film. The screeching when an unaffected person is found, the pods, the garbage trucks, and the spa are images that will stay with me forever.I will never go to San Francisco without being reminded of this movie.If you haven't seen this, rent it. But know that you will not sleep well for a few nights. You will keep hearing the words "don't go to sleep".The 50's original is good, but not acted as well as the 70's. The later one (90's) takes some of the scariest elements out. This is the one you want to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent paranoid science fiction thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen the original Invasion of the Bodysnatchers but I've long known of the basic set-up through its prodigious influence on genre cinema and writing. Its a terrific idea and endlessly adaptable, which is why there have been three remakes thus far and I'm sure more to come. This one is situated in late 70's San Francisco a fast moving affair with terrific effects work, fine performances and taut suspense steeped in the chilliest of post hippy bad vibes. Donald Sutherland is the hero of the piece, a Department of Health worker who gets involved in an ever escalating nightmare after his co-worker reports her husband acting, well, not himself. Sutherland is good value here, Democrat, skilled cook, able to laugh on his job, model public servant who smacks of free thought, while Brooke Adams is an ideal partner, bringing more of a early rising driven fear to the films earlier stages. As things move along they are joined in their growing awareness by Leonard Nimoy, Jeff Goldblum and Veronica Cartwright and the film offers some of its best moments here, quirk coming to the fore as the four players spark off each other. Apart from the largely stoic Nimoy, each brings a crackling live wire paranoia to their roles, Adams fearful, Sutherland methodical and Cartwright lively and loopy. Her character is the most far out of the group, an ancient aliens believer and she brings a memorable brightness to the role. One could hardly wish for a more engaging set to meet an individuality sapping menace and they do a great job of powering the film during some of its chase scene longueurs. Those slight lapses were my only real problem with the film, its action is never as interesting as its build up or its wondrous science fiction horror visuals. Fortunately the score keeps the atmosphere up even when the film seems to lag, with lots of nifty disturbing drones. Thematically the concern seems to be with the aftermath of the 60's, radicalism tapped into the mainstream, free thought consumed by quick solutions, societies encounter with such elements actually taking away its freedom. Notice that the aliens first spawn in the form of flowers, and especially the manner of the pod-peoples birth, illustrated in graphic fashion in a great, creepy sequence of obvious symbolism that I shall not reveal here. Altogether I thought this very fine stuff indeed, nightmarish situations, chilling atmosphere and powerful playing, virtually a must see for genre fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While some contend the original was a better version, I still prefer this one. Donald Sutherland, Jeff Goldblum and Leonard Nimoy was excellent, providing more logic and insight to the film where the original failed to accomplish. Sure, it was tougher to make a secret invasion of a large city seem more believable, but the more believable and rational appeal of this film puts it heads and tales above the rest. Also, the fact that it is a little more drawn out and conceptualized, it makes for a better night of movie making than the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake that not only lives up to the original perfectly but almost beats it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I say this as a big fan of the 1956 film. I have nothing against remakes, some are great, some are good, some are bad, some are downright awful. Fortunately Invasion of the Body Snatchers(1978) is one of the truly great ones, one of those rarities that not just lives up to the original film but almost beats it.The only reason why it doesn't quite is because the 1956 film does more with the change of the townsfolk. That said, it is a very well made film, with the special effects enhancing the mood rather than distracting from it and the scenery and cinematography striking. The make up is also outstanding.Invasion of the Body Snatchers also has a strong score that just adds to the tension and suspense, a compelling story especially the ending, in fact for me I marginally preferred the ending here, the dialogue is intelligent and well-delivered and the direction is very fine.There is some great acting too. Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams are strong leads, while Jeff Goldblum steals the scenes he appears in. Overall, a great film and worthy remake. Anybody who has not seen the Invasion with Craig and Kidman, it may be a good idea to keep it that way. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Remakes on Record!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid" director Philip Kaufman fashioned a genuinely sinister remake of the classic Don Siegel chiller "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (1956) that boasts everything an inspired remake requires to eclipse the hallowed original. Kaufman's Technicolor rehash changes the setting from a rural California town of Santa Mira in the middle 1950s to the sprawling metropolis of San Francisco during late 1970s. Scenarist W.D. Richter received an Oscar nomination for his adaptation of author Jack Finney's novel. In other words, Kaufman's film is not a strict remake because he didn't replicate the Siegel film shot-for-shot any more than Richter duplicated the dialogue and action. The Kevin McCarthy &amp; Dana Wynter relationship in the Siegel film differs from the adulterous relationship between Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams. Mind you, they never have any time to bed down with each other, but the relationship is still extramarital. Nevertheless, this outstanding science fiction remake ties itself to the original because the hysterical character that McCarthy played shows up during a traffic sequence. He is warning the world that all is not well and that 'they are coming for us.' As if this homage to the original didn't constitute something unusual for a remake produced twenty-two years later, the casting of the original director?Don Siegel?in a bit part a blessing of sorts for Kaufman's film. Indeed, Richter integrates the narrative from one film into another, despite the obvious fact that the McCarthy character couldn't have been on the lam that long. Since Kaufman and Richter have refused to confine themselves to a remake in the strictest sense of the meaning, they fleshed out the narrative considerably and provided visual exposition about the evil alien spores that migrate from a distant planet through space to settle on the Earth. The early sequence depicts how the alien spores--referred to as spider webs--permeated the Earth. Indeed, Kaufman and Richter have developed the narrative in greater depth than the Allied Artists' original without sacrificing any subtlety. The first-rate cast, headed by the incomparable Donald Sutherland of "M.A.S.H." fame, includes "Star Trek's" Leonard Nimoy, Jeff Goldblum, and Brooke Adams. Literally, Kaufman and Richter have taken the Siegel classic and given it a new lease on life with their elaborate, often thrilling, art-house version that plumbs the subject matter for far more. A metaphor for the changing world that appears early on during the action is the cracked windshield of our protagonist's car. Like everything else in "Invasion of the Body Snatchers," this symbolism doesn't get in the way of the action. Of course, the surprise ending is fantastic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best alien movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Donald Sutherland heads a cast of characters living in Sa Fransisco who slowly come to the realization that people all around them are being replicated and replaced by emotionless aliens. This is a GREAT tale of claustrophobia, paranoia and suspense. Of the many times I've seen it, the cast never truly shines, though they all get through the film without grating on me. They accurately portray every day people caught up in a terrifying situation, but no one ever grabs my attention above keeping me interesting. The true starts of this movie are the sound design and cinematography. The sounds of everyday life: city traffic, snip-its of conversation, the sounds of a dry cleaning store, multiple conversations overlapping are all used to create tension and keep you slightly tense and off balance. The camera work equally keeps you often off center. Odd angles, close up face shots, and in particular a scene where the hysteria of a scene is driven home by a rotating camera shot of a busy san Fransisco street combined with over lapping conversation is truly effective and serves to unnerve me every time i watch this scene. The story may have been told before, but i think this version captures the feelings of mistrust and paranoia far better. 8/10 high recommend for any fan of suspense or 70's cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best remakes ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most frightening movies of the 1970s as well as one of the very best remakes ever. Phillip Kaufman revisits Don Siegel's classic of '50s paranoia and transfers it to late '70s San Francisco, where people have become complacent, turned off and just plain bored. Soon the bored start to be replaced by pods from space and all hell breaks loose. Health inspector Donald Sutherland seems to be the only person realizing this is going on. Kaufman wisely continues Siegel's thread from twenty years prior by having the original star (Kevin McCarthy) pop up in a very odd cameo. The film is disturbing and, as it's grounded very much in reality, decidedly terrifying. Sutherland is great and Brooke Adams (as one of the few who believe what's happening) is dynamite. The supporting cast is eclectic and includes Jeff Goldblum, Veronica Cartwright (excellent) and Leonard Nimoy as a new age author with an answer for just about everything. Robert Duvall has a silent cameo in a playground.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That not my wife</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superior to the Nicole Kidman remake, this taut thriller remains a little less convincing than its 1956 predecessor of which that film's star (Kevin McCarthy) has a memorable cameo in this revision, picking up where his character left off in the original running frantically on the streets, warning motorists of the imminent invasion.Essentially the story revolves around Matthew (Sutherland) a health inspector who is inadvertently alerted to the possibility of humans being replaced by alien lookalikes. Ostensibly the same as the human predecessor, these aliens display a withdrawn and distant emotion which is ultimately the key to detecting their false identity. In the ensuing pursuit, Sutherland teams with Brooke Adams, Jeff Goldblum and Veronica Cartwright, while Leonard Nimoy makes his most significant acting contribution outside of "Star Trek" as the offbeat psychiatrist with ulterior motives.Some memorable scenes and dialogue delivers suspenseful moments (the laundromat husband concerned about the changes in his wife's demeanour when he confides in Sutherland with trembling concern "that not my wife, that not my wife"). Later when Sutherland returns, the man is no longer concerned about his wife's aloofness indicating he's been 'replaced'. There's also a graphic scene or two in which the evolving replacements appear as adult-sized embryos, to which Sutherland takes a pick to his own lookalike before it can reach maturity and 'replace' him.Probably a bit overlong, there' still enough thrills and suspense to entertain, and in the context of a remake (and in particular, one that remakes a classic sci-fi), director Kaufman has not disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Good If Not Better Than The Original Because of the Characters and razor-sharp Dialogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start out by saying that I am very fond of the original movie of 1956. But the biggest difference between the two films is the handling of the characters and the use of camera angles that ring of film noir. The characters of the 1956 offering are just a little bit generic. Dr Miles Bennell is an "ordinary" doctor in an ordinary town. Handsome and amiable, he does seem a bit "typical". The two couples that become the main focus are a little bit less defined, which was true of B-movie horror/SF flicks of the 1940's and 1950's in which the horror of the plot trumped character development. By the 1970's, horror had to some degree become more mainstream, and character development became nearly as important as the shock value in some of the higher-budgeted offerings. "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Exorcist" come to mind.The four characters of the 1978 film are quite distinctive individuals. Matthew Bennell (played by Donald Sutherland and essentially the equivalent character to Miles Bennell) is a bureaucratic FDA inspector who gets his car windshield smashed when he tags a restaurant for sub-standard quality. His best friend is Elizabeth Driscoll (Brook Adams) who is a fun-loving woman with a rye sense of humor and married to a sports fanatic. Both of the Jack Bellicec characters are writers, although in the 1978 offering, Jeff Goldblum's take on the role is as a very frustrated writer/poet who is jealous of the likes of Dr. David Kibner (Leonard Nimoy), pop-psychologist, writer and lecturer. Jack attends one of Kibner's lectures and book-signings. Nimoy plays his character to the hilt, acting like he has the answer to all people's problems. Goldblum at one point says "His ideas are garbage. Pure garbage." response: "How can you say that about a man like Kibner?" Goldblum: "Not a man like Kibner. I'm saying it about Kibner." We never find out what the character wrote about in the 1956 offering. Nancy Bellicec played by the incomparable Veronica Cartwright in the newer offering becomes a much more important character than in the 1956 film. She's the one, not Bennell, who realizes how to fool the "snatched" people by exhibiting no emotions. She has one of the best lines when she says "Well why not a space flower? Why do we always expect metal ships? Their lives start to fall apart when Elizabeth Driscoll claims her husband Geoffrey is not her husband. Before he is snatched, he is an amiable guy who enjoys watching sports events with headphones to hear the announcers. After he's snatched, all he watches on the television is a video of a stop-watch, as if for him life has stopped, and he's just marking time. She recounts to Sutherland how she followed him and that he was meeting all these strange people. Sutherland encounters others with similar dilemmas, particularly an older Asian couple who own a Laundromat. The older man claims "she not my wife." The build-up in the 1978 offering is a little slower and more deliberate. Jack's wife, Nancy Bellicec (Cartwright), discovers a duplicate body of Jack in a back room of their mud bath. At first the body seems to have almost no detail. But gradually it begins to look like Goldblum. Is there any connection with this body and this epidemic of people claiming that their loved ones are not their loved ones? In a particularly brilliant if not disturbing sequence, Bennell tries to call some of his contacts in the US government. The camera angles work well to literally dizzying affect as Bennell begins to realize the snatchers have infiltrated the government.An incredible take on Jack Finney's original novel about the horror of losing one's identity to an emotionless collective, sort of akin to what it would be like to have to spend eternity with either Jehovah Witnesses or Beaurocrats! You are no longer you but simply a clone among the collective, a terrifying thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hip, Stylized, Reworking of a Timeless Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably one of the most disturbing PG rated horror movies that I have ever seen, and one of the best remakes of an old classic. This movie is basically about the world being taken over by alien pods that replicate people, and then their clones become emotionless drones. A small group of survivors now must band together and stop them before they too become infected. There is one major factor that makes this movie so good and that's the way that it was written; in my opinion, remakes now a days don't have this kind of writing. This movie had a great cast of characters with excellent performances and a great theme that goes with the story. But, I cannot stress the fact that it is the best remake of its kind.The acting in this movie was very well done and performed by top notch actors and actresses. This movie had two great performances by Brooke Adams, who plays Elizabeth, and Veronica Carthwright, who plays Nancy. They both did outstanding job acting extremely paranoid and overall scared, which I think heightens the emotional intensity of this film; something that the clones in the film obviously don't have. There are outstanding performances by Donald Sutherland, who plays Matthew, and Jeff Goldblum, who plays Jack, whose somber yet paranoid performances encourage the overall theme of the movie. There is a good supporting cast by Leonard Nimoy, who plays Dr. David Kibner, and Art Hindle, who plays Dr. Geoffrey. There performances give this movie that extra bone chilling kick that makes this film so good. It's just an overall great performance by all the actors and actresses.As I said before, this movie is one of the best remakes ever, mainly because of the well-crafted writing and the plot structure that gives respects to the original movie. Because of the writing, there were a lot of disturbing undertones and scenes that the original movie could not accomplish, because of it's time, and those scenes are the "larval" stages of the clones, the slow build up of how the clones eventually take over everybody and just the way that the pods take over people. It's hard to explain, but the clones aren't just people running around taking over people, they are well organized, intelligent, systematic and horrifyingly emotionless. There screams haven't change that much, but in this reworking they are more of a horrible air raid siren. When you watch it, you'll notice that the clones and the progression of the alien take over is vastly different from the original and has a flavor to it that makes this movie raw, so to speak.Like the first movie, the central theme of this film is paranoia; however there is not allegory for real live events that would have caused this theme to work. However, what this movie does accomplish that the original one did not do is provide metaphors for what the world is experiencing. Case in point, there is a scene in which Sutherland is driving down a city block and we see a POV shot with a cracked window; this shows how the world we see is about to be shattered by the newly arrived guests. There are plenty of paranoia scenes, mostly dealing with Elizabeth and Mathew, but the one sequence that shows Mathew's paranoia is when he is calling all the emergency agencies and they all refuse him while he is vision is blurred with paranoia. There is plenty of third-characters that heighten this theme even more than the main characters and secondary characters. A good example is when an old man jumps on Sutherland's car and screams about how "they" are taking over the world. This old man is played by none other than Kevin McCarthy from the original movie.Overall, this movie is one of the best remakes ever; I really cannot stress that enough. This remake had things that remakes now a days don't have and that's a well crafted plot, great performances and a hard hitting central theme. This movie's plot structure pays tribute and respects to the original 50s classic. This is one of those few cases were the remakes is equal are better to its predecessor. I would strongly recommend this movie to any horror fan as well as any beginning horror fanatic. Those who are a fan of the original and cult classics would enjoy this too; ultimately I think any kind of horror fan should see this movie because it is very memorable. As for me, this is a movie that I can watch again and again because it's just very well made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dripping with killer spores from outer space, Phil Kaufman's claustrophobic remake unleashes cinematic chills and flurries of fright and imagination. Brilliant. The movie does not take a false step. Never. But look out for the cracks in the sidewalk--especially that crack in the windshield of Doctor Bunnel's government-issued vehicle. Usually, I think it would be a mistake to monkey around and update a true classic. But here is one of the rarest of treats: a competent and artistic remake. Maybe, the best. The location change to San Francisco is ingenious. Even inspiring. Underrated Brook Adams is wonderful and carry's her own special effect around in her hip pocket: rolling and darting her big brown eyes back and forth like crazy ping pong balls. Amazing. Meanwhile, Donald Sutherland has his best part since he played "Hawkeye" in M*A*S*H. There are a slew of clever touches: breezy pinwheels, recoiling telephone cords, and upright dry cleaning presses; all of which fill the soundtrack with scary jolts and sharp noises. The Transamerica Pyramid looms over the entire film. In 1978, special effects were mounted in very real terms--nothing phony could be used to dress up a shot. Veronica Cartwright, a child actress who gave "Beaver Cleaver" on television his first smooch, has a beefy and star making turn as a ditsy urban dweller. Leonard Nimoy scores as the logical psychiatrist. No surprise there. And a youthful and lanky Jeff Goldblum jabbers away like a man on speed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Respectable remake, but not as good as original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' is one of my favorites. There were so many films from the 1950s that involved an alien threat menacing small town Americana, but 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' was one of the few standouts because it took what it was doing seriously. Not another in a long series of man-in-a-rubber-suit movies, its tactics were more psychological. We, like Dr. Bennell, are uncertain what's going on or even if there actually *is* anything going on until its too late. Then the walls close in on the doctor and Becky, and nowhere is safe, there is nowhere to hide. Added to this is the film's ambiguous subtext, and you end up with a movie that really is much better than it should be.While I don't think the remake was bad necessarily, I don't think there's anything remarkable about it either. It was good for what it was, but it lacked any real suspense because it began by revealing the threat and then rushed to get that threat underway. Setting the film in a large city was a mistake. One of the strengths of the original was the confusion and horror the characters felt as they slowly watched the people around them, the people they had grown up with and known so well, become strangers. That element's lost when you set the movie in a place where nearly everyone is a stranger to begin with, where you wouldn't know if the person walking down the street is different today than they had been the day before. I also think the third act is overly long and drags out.Kudos to the man-faced dog, though. That was great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Under-celebrated Sci-Fi-Horror Classic...who knew in 1978?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do these people all have in common? Donald Sutherland ... Brooke Adams Jeff Goldblum Veronica Cartwright Leonard Nimoy Kevin McCarthy They all had roles in one of the most underrated sci-fi/horror films of all time. It's a pleasure to revisit it every time---and that has been often. 7.4/10.0 on IMDb and I concur. Notably, this 1978 remake of this 1956 classic, unfolds with almost ~zero~ soundtrack music to garnish the scenes or the dialogue. Occasionally some orchestral trumpets blare to accompany forthcoming shocks. I won't bore you with a plot synopsis. Who hasn't seen one of the versions of it? It's an iconic grandparent to many sci-fi offspring over the past 3 decades. BTW; just an aside...a young Jeff Goldblum has already begun to carve out his specialty niche in 'Snatchers-2'; e.g; the fast-talking eccentric whose free associating dialogue keeps the film moving at a brisk pace... (yet with no particular goal in mind.) Goldblum has this particular 'shtick' patented...reacting to scenes like they were Rorschach inkblots is a colorful additive. Alba's Real Science Ratings give it an acceptable RSR...i.e; it's realistic except for stretches the "MacGuffin" (the body snatching pods.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well made film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had an amazing story that gives a nice thrill and makes you wonder what will happen next. It was as adventurous as scary and it will leave you excited during the whole film. The reason i liked this movie was because it was special and was not boring like the modern movies we have today. Many actors in the movie were awesome and there was one character that i loved the most and that was a beautiful girl named Nancy, i wont tell you what she will do in the movie but I can say that she was probably the smartest of them but she did make a mistake, you will understand what I mean after you watched the whole film. I usually don't watch scary movies but this one took the cake and i really recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a double bill of two versions, 1956 and 1978</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A thrilling double-bill of this classic tall-tale of alien body-snatchers, based on Jack Finney's novel, for latter-day audience, perhaps we can still recall the latest remake THE INVASION (2007, 5/10), as a star vehicle for Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig, which was dead on arrival as a major flop and presages their next colossal box-office fiasco THE GOLDEN COMPASS (2007, 4/10). Fortunately these two earlier versions are considerably better than the ill-fated mega-star paycheck product, the original 1954 film is directed by Don Siegel (DIRTY HARRY 1971, 7/10), within a condensed 80 minutes, it delineates the absurd story with a gripping pace and impressive monochromatic cinematography. Miles Bennell (McCarthy) is a small-town doctor, who has just reunited with his sweetheart Becky Driscoll (Wynter), they discover that many townsfolk are progressing into a widespread hysteria and claim their relatives have turned into emotionless where as their pretense remains the same. Soon with another couple Jack and Teddy (Donovan and Jones), they come to grasp that human beings are being duplicated during their sleep by unspecified alien species, things goes downhill quickly, they have to differentiate aliens among people they know, flee for help while try their best to resist the overwhelming sleepiness.Due to the curb of special effects development and budget, the supposedly bone-chilling scenes with human replicas are visibly mannequins covered with foam, and the extraterrestrial seedpods are equally below the groundbreaking line albeit the eerie and intense atmosphere is rendered in full throttle. McCarthy exerts sizable effort to maintain the intriguing momentum meanwhile manages to squeeze time to ignite the moment of romance with Wynter, although appearing on screen for most of the screen-time, whose role is inclusively subsidiary, merely as a gorgeous love interest and a shorthand of a secretary. The rest of cast is serviceable but there is no room for any showboating in the taut storyline. Wisely, the film probes into the analysis of humanity-depravity process, even disregard the reference of the purported metaphor for the McCarthyism at then, the sudden action of draining away humanity into a void robot shed an urgent light to our mundane procedure of dehumanizing our personality in a far slower but equally toxic manner. The film starts with a flashback to the horrifying happenings, and the ending echoes Mile's narrative with a more encouraging upshot, which conveniently slackens off the impact of a no-way-out despair when Miles finally reaches the highway, no one stops to listen to him and overtly the seedpods have already been transported to elsewhere to indicate a thorough duplication of our entire race is ominously under way. Plus, one inexplicable mishap is that there is no explanation of what happens to the original body when his or her inexpressive clone comes into life (thankfully, in the 1978 version, it is explicitly demonstrated). The 1978 color version is directed by Philip Kaufman (QUILLS 2000, 6/10), the story is transposed to a metropolitan San Francisco, Matthew Bennell (Sutherland) and Elizabeth Driscoll (Adams) are fellow health inspectors, while Elizabeth is living with her dentist boyfriend Geoffrey (Hindle), screenwriter W.D. Richter upgrades the romance to the mutual attraction between two colleges after Geoffrey firstly being replaced. One striking feature of this remake is to visualize the aliens in a more graphic picture, ever since the opening credits, beholders are fully witnessed how the unearthly life forms arrive and thrive on our planet. Using lurid palette and tilted camera angle to evince that the abnormality is threatening (with a cameo of Robert Duvall), these two stunts are further maneuvered to produce the omnipresent weirdness with the hypnotizing sound effect. From the floral embellishment, to the spooky mud bath, to the paranoiac street mania, Kaufman does modernize the original concept up to the hilt, it is also more scarier and disturbing by default. Sutherland crafts a slow-burning exigency of being a reluctant hero under a rampant panic, the utile assault he is wreaking on the primitive clones and a final howl guarantees his leading status in this overhaul of a telling fiction. 1978 is a breakthrough year for Brooke Adams, starring both Terrence Malick's DAYS OF HEAVEN (1978, 9/10) and this Sci-Fi remake, her Elizabeth is more intuitive and has more initiative to get to the bottom of the mystery, the chemistry between her and Sutherland is also given a full-extent development. Leonard Nimoy, brings a solid supporting role as Dr. David Kibner, masks his ulterior motive instead of being conspicuously opinionated as Larry Gates in the original movie. A youthful Jeff Goldblum is offered very few to perform, whereas Veronica Cartwright, who would be best remembered as a regular in Sci-Fi or fantasy productions (ALIEN 1979, 9/10; THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK 1987, 5/10), assumes the most sleep-resistant character in the climactic finale. The ending is essentially different from the original and the novel itself (where the aliens voluntarily retreat), with its silent end-credits, it surprisingly evokes a sublimated sensation of shock value. Also worth mentioning, Kevin McCarthy and Don Siegel's cameos are signs in homage to the original. Generally speaking both films are of excellency to be viewed by newer generations and personally, I give an edge to Kaufman's more comprehensive achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best remakes to this day.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Invasion Of The Body Snatchers has to be one of the best remakes made to this day. It is able to go in different directions and expand on ideas that were shown in the original while being able still remain true to the what the originals vision. The idea of aliens imitating humans work better for the times that this was released.With the film being in San Francisco compared to the small town of the original shows how disconnected from each other people really are.It is able to relate to the idea of communism which was at the time seen as a very big threat by the general public and because of this is able to create a very real story about free will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's Painless... It's Good... Come... Sleep."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It's painless.. It's good... Come... Sleep." These words, irresistible to an exhausted and frightened man, are spoken with soothing authority by the woman he absolutely adores. But this is one of the moments of chilling horror in Philip Kaufman's 1978 re-imagining of the '50's classic, "Invasion of the Body Snatchers".The original, where a small-town doctor (Kevin McCarthy) is confronted by patients who claim that their loved-ones are not quite themselves, is a superb thriller of gradually escalating paranoia. But Kaufman's version is truly something else altogether. Set in a big city (San Francisco), mostly at night, it is an unfolding nightmare fraught with alienation, suspicion and panic. I saw this film when it was first released in Toronto. Several weeks later I was looking in a department store window - I remember this clearly - when I heard a police siren. A chill ran up my spine and my mind shot back to this movie. That's the extent to which it got under my skin. It's not just the cacophony of police sirens and garbage truck rumblings which pervade this "Invasion...", it's the part electronic, part orchestral score by Denny Zeitlin and the sound effects by Ben Burtt. Combined with Michael Chapman's eerie photography and extremely visceral images they make this a very creepy experience indeed.With pod people running amok the pervasive sense of danger is amplified by the fact that the people we get to know and love in the movie are so HUMAN and endearingly eccentric. They're a motley crew played by Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, Jeff Goldblum and Veronica Cartwright. They're not the usual movie cardboard cut-out heroes. It really matters that they survive, and to lose them would be heartbreaking and tragic. This is the weight at the movie's core.This is not some serious piece that must be gravely pondered. Kaufman and the writer, W.D. Richter, knew full well that they were dealing with pulp sci-fi material and they weren't about to drain the fun out of it. From screaming spores rushing through space to Kevin McCarthy still running after all these years, from winks at American sci-fi culture to Leonard Nimoy's turn as a flatulent pop psychology guru this movie displays a wit that I can't remember having seen before in this sort of venture. Oh, and there's a really demented bit of humour involving a banjo-playing man and his dog.Kaufman's "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" is a major living, breathing work of art from the paranoid '70's and a triumph of good old-fashioned film-making. It is, surely, one of the best horror movies ever made. It flexes its cold fingers and stirs our deepest fears. What if I go to bed and don't wake up the same? What if I lose what is uniquely me and become like everybody else? What if I can't feel love anymore? Now that's scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It'll give you chills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original 1956 version, but I saw this one last night, and I can tell you, it was a scary good time! Starting off with what I think is a scientifically brilliant alien invasion, the movie kicks off with Elizabeth Driscoll (Brooke Adams) picking a flower and bringing it home. The next morning, her husband is "different", as she says. Many people begin to notice their spouses are "different" in the same way, and she goes to her friend Matthew Bennell (Donald Sutherland) for help. As more and more people begin to get affected by this disease, they feel alone, and the suspense tightens, and the first appearance of a pod really puts things "out there".All the performances are good, and I thought the two lead roles with Brooke Adams and Donald Sutherland were fantastic. They are part of a foursome that feels isolated, and these "emotionless zombies" seem to be closing in on them, and things are getting a little too hot for them. And they are aided by a mysterious psychiatrist who dismisses the whole "alien invasion", but for all they know, he could be one himself!That's what makes the film so good. You don't always know whose good and who is bad. A lot of the people have obviously been "snatched", but some of the snatched seem to be smarter than the brainless zombies that are beginning to parade through the San Francisco streets, and that's where the film gets you thinking and gets you worried. While a lot of horror/thriller films are unsuccessful when they reveal their "faceless" monsters, this film is all around scary. The births of those who are being snatched is disturbing and disgusting, and the suspense of isolation is a dark tone that purges the film, making EVERYTHING scary.It's not PG though. Yes, that's what it's rated, but in no way can it be viewed as a PG movie- it's really more like a strong PG-13. There is frequent scary scenes, disgusting and disturbing images, and some nudity. I thought that with this being PG it wouldn't be scary, but it was.I was excited to see the film, and was pleased when all was said and done. One of the best quotes in the film is when Nancy says, "Maybe they are from outer space...you know they don't always have to come down in metal ships". If there ever were an alien invasion and war on mankind, it wouldn't be in the form of giant metal ships that blast us with their ray guns. No, it could be something like this, and that's another reason why this movie is so terrifying and brilliant. It gave me chills. 7.6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospherically, Stylistically, and Tonally the Ideal Traditional American Sci-Fi Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is an essential for the feeling one can enjoy from the right kind of horror or sci-fi movie that makes you just want to snuggle up in front of the TV late at night or on a really rainy or snowy day when no one's around, have everything you need within arm's reach of the couch or comfy chair accompanied by a close ottoman you're camping out on, and lose yourself in it's eerily fun atmosphere. It is several times better than the original, which was treated with an unbearable lightness, virtually as if it were a romantic comedy. Philip Kaufman, the director of this 1978 version, gives the film a fast-paced yet homey style that includes the dynamic cinematography and music that make the exact type of film it is work.This version does not have the ideal atmosphere for a straight horror movie, but a sci-fi film. It makes us feel the way we want to feel before watching a movie like Forbidden Planet or The Day the Earth Stood Still or The Invisible Man or, actually, like the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers. And in a good, cozy, eerie sci-fi film on a late October or November night, unlike the right horror film, it's great to have a cast of actors with particularly amiable presence, which this film has, such as Donald Sutherland as the modest, practical, and analytical hero, and Jeff Goldblum as Jeff Goldblum, which is absolutely no criticism, because that is exactly what I want to see from Jeff Goldblum. However, Brooke Adams, whose performance is fine if not a highlight like Sutherland's or Goldblum's, looks quite remarkably like Karen Allen.To me, this version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers is atmospherically, stylistically, and tonally the ideal traditional American sci-fi film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visceral update that's pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An update of the classic from 1956.The plot is basically the same with strange pods landing this time in San Francisco. Soon certain people are not quite who they were before lacking all emotional touch they used to have. A small group of people not yet taken by the pods, figure this out and try to do something, but the situation looks hopeless.As with most remakes the film suffers on many levels. First and foremost anyone who has seen the first will not be in for much surprises since the plot and development is all very similar if not the same. The pods are even shown landing in the beginning of the film, which was a poor move since within the first 2 minutes people who HAVEN'T seen the original will know more than they should to totally enjoy the story. Much of the ambiguity is unnecessarily made clear in those moments and the original was ambiguous well into the film and you never knew more than the characters. Here that is not the case. Even as the pods begin to "awaken" (for lack of a better word) there is a pretty big focus on special effects with all sorts of tentacles going up peoples' noses and ears. I don't know about you, but if a slimy tentacle went up my nose, I think I'd stop breathing and sort of notice. The purely mental connection from the first one was more terrifying. As is small town setting where everyone knows everyone. The big city seems like a good place to place an update of the original, but the spread and suspicions as well as the fears of the protagonists aren't nearly as intense as they were in the first. Perhaps it is due to the general lack of suspense I felt since I have seen the original. First time viewers of the "Body Sntachers" films will undoubted have more to be tense about.However, this version does deserve credit for some innovation. The twist on the dog scene from the original is a REAL GOOD jolter. There is a fairly big consistency from the original that has been fixed in that we learn what happens to bodies after the pod clone is born. And the special effects aren't bad, quite gruesome actually, but they almost outrun themselves. --- 7/10Rated PG, pretty generously, for violence and horror. Ages 13+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who Can You Trust?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first remake of the paranoid infiltration classic moves the setting for the invasion from a small town to the city of San Fransisco and starts as Matthew Bennell notices that several of his friends are complaining that their close relatives are in some way different. As the invaders increase in number, who can he trust to help him and who has already been snatched?No, I have not seen any Body Snatcher movie, except this one, obviously, if you don't count "The Faculty" as a Body Snatcher movie (which it is in some way). And yes, it took me this long to watch this movie. Did I like this movie? Of course! I liked it a lot!This is like "Alien". The movie is chilling and unsettling and it works. The scenes actually works! Yeah, I knew the ending before watching this movie (stupid Wikipedia) and I knew it would've been bad but that's the only complaint I will give to this movie. I didn't like the ending.Other than that, this movie took my attention from throughout the film. Yeah, there are some scenes that dragged the movie (it was a bit too long, I thought) but there are some really suspenseful and tense scenes.The performances are great from the cast, including Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams and the score is really creepy. Body Snatchers is a movie that will scare you with its quiet scenes and make you feel for the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leonard Nimoy's Best Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched this film for the first time in years and was struck by a number of things. Not the least of these was the performance of Leonard Nimoy. Bearing in mind the relative breakdown of his career at the time of Kaufman's remake, this is a terrific and brave performance. A lot of actors would probably have sought out a more sympathetic or less complicated role but Nimoy doesn't play it safe. Arguably, as anti-Spock as anything he's ever done, Kaufman elicits a perfectly modulated take on the pop-psych guru-types of the era and then, with great surprise, reveals that Nimoy's Doctor is one of THEM. The spookiest scene in the film may be Nimoy's final conversation with Sutherland and not the explosive ending.Great stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me this is the best sci-fi thriller of all time. Aliens is good too, but this is the best. I won't spoil the ending, but it is the most chilling of all time! I love the original; it was a touchstone of my youth. We used to refer to it often in my family &amp; in the neighborhood. Pod people... There is a brilliant simplicity in the original, low budget but tight &amp; effective. This remake shows you what can be done w/ money. Everything hinted at is seen in '78. Yet the plot &amp; the tension take on commensurate sophistication and artistic ambiguity. Nimoy's gobbledygook explanation of why this horror is not really happening is one of the greatest things in the movies. It's a brilliant satire on self-help and feel-good pop psychology. Lord, do I wish Hollywood would come up w/ something so brilliant again...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrifying in its portrayal of "inhuman" nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1978, I was 12 and saw this film, and it gave me nightmares for ages. The reason is simple: those you trust will, if they can, betray you. I know the film and its original refer to consumerism and McCarthyism, but to me, at its core, it speaks a scary truth about human nature. When Sutherland lets out his horrendous, traitorous Pod-yell at his trusting, conspiratorial friend, who approaches him as still being human, his betrayal so deeply affected me that I remember the ending 29 years later. I can't sleep tonight after re-viewing the film, and no horror/slasher movie has affected me more. The stuff people consider to be "horror" now is all about violence, gore, misogyny, and brutality, but this director veered into our feelings and our decisions about trusting others, about which we are often, as humans, inherently wrong. This, in itself, is horror. And that's what the director of "Invasion" deeply understood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like the original, this movie improves with age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>25 years ago, I saw this movie as a teenager. Now I work near the Dept. of Health building where several scenes take place, so I thought it would be a kick to watch again (for about the 6th time). Once again, I was struck by how strong this thriller is and how it's themes and sense of dread have become stronger over time. The original from the 50's was a great parable for the Cold War (your neighbors can't be trusted, conformity is the enemy, the film could actually be claimed by both schools of thought as a metaphor, that is a true sign of greatness). This version by Phil Kaufman and screenwriter W.D. Richter ups the ante on the paranoia factor by moving the action from small town U.S.A. to big diverse city. In a big city people become insular, relating to few, and knowing fewer. Thus, the concept of an underground, or hidden, movement working behind the scenes becomes all too real. People are chased down the street and witnesses simply stare, if that. The desire to assist the authorities turns into a struggle against the system. If alien invaders (or in our modern society - terrorist factions) were to suddenly absorb individuals in a big city, I imagine it would happen just as it does in this film. Quietly and under our noses. We'd see strange things, but dismiss it as our imagination getting the better of us. And all the while, those with influential positions could easily be part of the menace and easily use their position to complete the takeover. Images of cultivation plants in remote areas and cargo ships in deserted shipyards being loaded with pods says it all; there would be no way to stop the process.The movie works on all levels. It's suspenseful, has moments of humor, quality acting and production values, fun cameos (Robert Duvall, Kevin McCarthy, etc.), a great ambient score, effects that still look pretty damn good, and a great shocker ending. They don't make genre pictures like this anymore. An interesting footnote; just weeks prior to the film's release, San Francisco was hit by two tragedies, the mass suicide of the Peoples Temple and the assassination of Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Milk at City Hall. This must have dealt an unnatural eeriness to Bay Area audiences still reeling from real life events while watching scenes of their city fall to unseen invaders operating out in the open in front of the same City Hall.</fullReview>

I do not have the original available, but Kevin McCarthy does have a small role in this remake.This film features Donald Sutherland (MASH, Ordinary People, and my favorite, Eye of the Needle), Brooke Adams (Gas, Food Lodging), Jeff Goldblum (Independence Day, Jurassic Park, The Fly), Veronica Cartwright (Alien, The Witches of Eastwick), and Leonard Nimoy ("Star Trek") as the main characters.Oscar nominated writer/director Phillip Kaufman (The Unbearable Lightness of Being, The Right Stuff, Quills) was honored for this film by Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films.Composer Denny Zeutlin produced an outstanding score for this film, but it so wore him out that never accepted another assignment.Invasion of the Body Snatchers is not a cheap horror film, but a thoughtful, provocative piece of paranoia about how Americans are being turned into a society of emotionless robots. You will be born again.Keep an eye out for an uncredited appearance by Robert Duvall.SKIN-fining Moment: Brooke Adams, who did a great eye roll early in the film, walks topless through the pod factory before pointing out Donald Sutherland's presence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above average replicant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version (1978) follows the general outline of the earlier version (1956) but suffers from being still another remake in what appears to be a recent cascade of replicants. Talk about pods.What happens is that these pods grow from seeds that have drifted down from outer space. The seeds produce pods that grow into imitations of individuals human beings, with all of the details of the original but without any emotions such as love or hate. The pods finally seem to win.Right away, there are questions about just how this business works. At least in this version we know what happens to the old, original bodies when they're replaced. They turn into some ashen fluff that's thrown out with the garbage. The 1956 version left that manhole uncovered.And yet this one is pretty cavalier with the dynamics of podification too. Both versions show that the target person has to be asleep in order for the pod to replace him or her. But in neither version is it clear that the pods must be in physical proximity to the victim. Much is made here of the victim putting the evil flower next to his bed so it can more easily take over while he's asleep. But sometimes, as in the case of Elizabeth (Brooke Adams), she falls asleep out in the middle of nowhere and her replica arises from nearby reeds, where no pod has ever had any reason to tread.And this version, unlike the earlier one, has scenes that suggests thin slimy tendrils must creep up a victim's arm and into his sleeping nose and eyes in order to complete the process. At other times the tendrils are evidently superfluous.Then too, if the replicants are as they say, devoid of emotion, well then how do they -- well, reproduce? Do they pollinate? Now, this movie, like the successful pods, is a replicant too. But it's not bad for what it is. There's a playful element to the script and the direction that reflects its Zeitgeist, as did the original. If the 1956 version was all about a small community in which everyone knew and trusted everyone else, and everyone was kind and generous, and the conformity was stultifying but satisfying, that's kind of what the 1950s were like -- full of what Emile Durkheim called mechanical solidarity.Eighteen years that happened to encompass the 1960s is a long time between an original and a remake. And this update is bound to a particular location, San Francisco, a big beautiful wide-open city, not an encapsulated village. The ludic spirit informs this later version, so the script has several jokes in it. When a formless, lifeless dead body with some revolting attributes appears in a mud bath, the proprietress (Veronic Cartwright) warns the others, "Don't touch it! You don't know where it's been!" As if it were a stray cat.In the original, a treacly Spanish song leads Matt Binnell (Kevin McCarthy there, Donald Southerland here) to believe that anyone listening to such beautiful music must be human. Here, the music Bennell hears is "Amazing Grace" on the bagpipes. That piece is a commercial and artistic cliché by now, but it wasn't in 1974. The fad for the hymn on bagpipes may well have been started by the piper who played every Saturday night at The Edinburg Castle on Geary. Kevin McCarthy, by the way, has a cameo as the guy who flops on the hood of Southerland's car and screams, "They're coming! You're next!" And the director of the 1956 version, Don Siegel, appears as a taxi driver who is a pod person.San Francisco is a strangely tolerant city and is probably the most suitable American place to develop a contrast between ordinary citizens and those who are emotional black holes like the pod people. Example. An acquaintance of mine, Waldo, who appeared as an extra in this movie, was a successful artist in Berkeley and while I was chatting with him about his work, which IMHO was pretty good, he described how he got his ideas. Whenever he had an interesting dream he would wake up and quickly sketch the images and take a few notes. To wake him up, he wore around his head a band that had jingly bells sewn onto it, in the belief that when he dreamed his head rolled around more actively. His wife, sitting next to him on the couch, remarked laconically, "I guess it works if you say so, Waldo, but it still feels a little weird to sleep next to a guy with bells on his head." She didn't CARE that Waldo wore a fool's cap to bed, and neither would anyone else. That's what I mean when I described the city as tolerant of alternative approaches to life. Nobody cared if Harvey Milk was gay or the Emporer Norton claimed to rule California or a Viennese weight lifter was elected to the post of governor. In 1982 one of the candidates for a city office was a male transvestite, Sister Boom Boom, who wore a miniskirted nun's outfit and sported garish makeup and high heels. Her platform? "Nun of the above." She was on the ballot as an official candidate. You can see, I hope, that there could hardly be a greater contrast between some of these people and the pods. I wouldn't have wanted the remake to be filmed anywhere else.The movie is a good remake but not without its flaws. Why does it have to end so pessimistically? And that pig-like squeal with which converts point out the unconverted is a bad idea. It's unpleasant to listen to and unsubtle. In the novel the pods sensibly gave up because resistance was too strong. They floated back into space. That kind of discretion is sometimes a perfectly reasonable way to get out of a tight spot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If it were not a remake..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>..then It would be a very original movie.The main concept is very interesting,with a plot as rich as you can imagine in sci-fi:it could be a metaphor on totalitarianism,but ,in a more universal way,it is our world,in which we are more and more asked not to show our emotions."Big boys don't cry" mama tells her sensitive boy.Supposing that this is the case,and because this is a remake,and a remake of a one of the strongest sci-fi movies in history (Don Siegel,1956),we 've got to expect a new approach,some further developments,in a nutshell,we want to be deeply surprised.Whether Kaufman succeeds in such a difficult task,the answer is unfortunately no.Yes,there are special effects.Yes,there are good actors:Donald Sutherland,excellent as always,Jeff Godblum,who will score high in the eighties.Yes there are a good use of shadows and light,and of short focal distance,a la Polanski.The last picture is strongly reminiscent of that of "the tenant" (Polanski,1976)But,on the minus side,there are "updates " that are hard to swallow.Best/worst example:in Siegel 's version,there's a terrifying revealing scene which consists in ..a kiss.It becomes an overtly erotic scene,here,complete with nudity,losing all its emotional power. All the ideas were already in Siegel's version,which renders the new one predictable,really that crowns it for a movie which focuses on suspense.SPOILER * SPOILER* SPOILER IN THIS PART: A good trick is to be credited to the script writers.At the end of the movie,Sutherland becomes like "them".The director did not use the cinematographic codes:he did not show Sutherland's surrender,and as he leaves his office ,we think he's always "normal".That kind of ellipsis ,which will rarefy as the cinema makes its way across the eighties,shows that he assimilated at least one of the Master Alfred's lessons.END OF SPOILER.There will be a third version(Body snatchers,Ferrara,1994).I agree with M.Maltin when he writes:"Setting the story in a military base when everybody's is supposed to act alike...not a good idea " Stick up with Don Siegel's version,without color,scope,stars,but with a genius going for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Average. Overall a Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the special effects to be the only thing of strong value in this movie. It involves a health department and scientific research team investigating why people are becoming zombie-like shortly after going to sleep. I liked the beginning of the movie the best. The viewer is drawn into some clever outer-space camera shots. One feels that this is going to be good.But than, it dies. The dialog is predictable and corny. Even the good actors can not make up for them being forced into B-grade Sci-Fi acting. Invasion of the Body Snatchers seems to drag on and on with very little to excite the viewer. In fact it was on one of my local stations last night and I kept falling asleep missing the last half hour of the movie! To achieve a great sci-fi effect that is everlasting to the viewer, there needs to be a suspense or build up that is maintained throughout the film. A few screams here and there over some strange corpses would be something that you would expect from a 50's horror film. This would be good for its time, but not enough for a 1978 film, which incidentally is a remake.With this film coming out the year after Close Encounters of the Third Kind and the Star Wars phenomenon, one would expect better pacing in this film. IOTBS appears to have been put together with several characters that don't get into a weak plot, combined with a 50's type script. Good special effects can not save this weak movie.It's too bad that the quality cast ensemble didn't have a stronger, faster-paced, script to showcase their acting abilities so that this film could have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's in my top ten films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes it's a real pleasure to re-watch a childhood favourite and find out that it holds up just as well today as it did when you first saw it in your rose-tinted memories. Well, guess what, INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS is just one of those pleasures, a truly terrifying alien invasion flick that offers first-rate suspense. In fact, I can fairly say this is the most claustrophobic, suspenseful, paranoid, conspiracy-style movie I've had the enjoyment of watching; no other film exactly matches the rising hysteria and the sense that your neighbours are out to kill you. Sure, the movie is slow-paced by today's standards, but that adds to the realism and the sense that you're watching a slice of everyday life unfold, albeit with a major twist.The movie is a remake of the good 1956 original and '50s star Kevin McCarthy has a wonderful cameo as pretty much the same character. The first thing you notice when you watch the film is that it isn't dated at all; the script is refreshingly true-to-life and the characters are normal, everyday modern people. Director Kaufman offers up excellent camera-work and editing to highlight the brooding suspense and deepening chaos without ever going over the top, even in the pyrotechnic climax. The casting too, is top-notch; the major players are a carefully-assembled group of unconventionals who find themselves banded together against alien evil. Tall, gangly Donald Sutherland is all bug-eyes and heroism and looks like he stepped straight off the set of DON'T LOOK NOW; Brooke Adams is all wide-eyes and fragile feminine beauty. Then there's the always kooky Jeff Goldblum in a first major performance, possibly even weirder than we're used to; whilst Veronica Cartwright displays the screaming credentials which earned her a part on board ALIEN.One of the film's most inspired pieces of casting is in Mr. Spock himself, Leonard Nimoy as a psychologist doctor, a really creepy character at that. Then there are the little things that make this film hold together so well: the continuity being immaculate (see the kicking the pod sequence for an explanation of this) and the weird, pulsing sound effects and dodgy music. Special effects are underused and work so well as a result; they're ace and the stuff of nightmares, and definitely scared the heck out of this reviewer at the tender age of 12 or so. The culmination of all this great stuff is an awesome movie that stands the test of time as THE greatest alien invasion flick there is ? Spielberg should have tried watching this when he made his pointless and overblown WAR OF THE WORLDS remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Invasion of a Great Update.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978): Dir: Philip Kaufman / Cast: Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, Leonard Nimoy, Jeff Goldblum, Veronica Cartwright: Ominous and chilling remake that is every bit as great as the original, only it heightens the paranoia aspect. Set in glorious San Francisco, Donald Sutherland plays Health Department representative Matthew Bennell who is confronted with cases of people not being who they are emotionally. Brooke Adams plays Elizabeth Driscoll whose husband is different. These people fall asleep and replaced by pod lookalikes thanks to a flower that Driscoll discovers. Leonard Nimoy plays Dr. Kibner, a friend of Bennell's who attempts to explain this bizarre event in society. Unfortunately Nimoy is too obvious in his motives. The relationship between Bennett and Driscoll is subtle with a hint of romantic interest that is not tresspassed due to her marriage. Another interesting marriage relationship is between Jeff Goldblum and Veronica Cartwright who work in a massage parlor mud bath where a pod body is discovered. Director Philip Kaufman creates paranoia while toying with gadgets and showcasing Adams and her weird eye twirl talent. It can also symbolize the Biblical Rapture when one factors the shocking ending. Great update with a strong theme regarding paranoia and the importance of personality and the outside forces that invade one's senses. Score: 9 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranoia and horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Invasion of the Body Snatchers is directed by Philip Kaufman, has a screenplay by W.D Richter, is based on the novel by Jack Finney and stars Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, Veronica Cartwight, Jeff Goldblum and Leonard Nimoy.Usually remakes are terrible in comparison with the original film or series, occasionally though there are some exceptions and this film is one of those.This film is extremely horrific thanks to the impressive pod effects and makeup. The growing pods look organic, they look like living things being born and that realistic look really freaks you out, you believe that what you are seeing is real. This film proves that if you want something to look real then you should use real things instead of using effects. Computer generated effects wouldn't have been able to create anything that looked so real as what we see here.The sound effects in this film are brilliant too, the sound we hear for example when a pod person is being born sounds like a heartbeat and is quite unnerving. There is also the chilling scream of the pod people, this is truly scary and I also like how in this film the pod people are depicted as having a hive mind and they can sense when someone is still human.We also get to see how the alien invasion begins in this version. Alien spores land on earth and attach themselves to plants, they then grow into flowers and then transform into seed pods. At first just a few people are killed and their bodies duplicated. Characters notice that people seem different and if you pay attention throughout the film the bin lorries can all be seen collecting the dusty remains of humans who have been killed and duplicated and that helps give the film another level of creepiness.Health official Elizabeth Driscoll(Brooke Adams)is concerned when her boyfriend's personality changes, she becomes afraid of him and asks the advice of her friend and colleague Matthew Bennell(Donald Sutherland). Matthew thinks she is imaging things and recommends that she sees a therapist he knows(Leonard Nimoy)to discuss her fears with. As time goes on Elizabeth notices many other people seem different and soon Matthew notices the change too.Jack and Nancy Bellicec (Jeff Goldblum and Veronica Cartwright) are friends of Matthew who own a health spa. One night they discover a growing pod person in the spa and call Matthew. This small group realise something is happening and when they discover that people in authority have been changed too they realise that they can trust nobody except each other. They soon discover that going to sleep makes it easy for the pods to assimilate their next human victims, so they have to try and stay awake as they attempt to avoid detection as their city is overrun by the alien invaders. This film is truly chilling and the paranoia depicted here is off the scale, these characters can trust no one not even each other. The scene featuring the half man and half dog pod person is one of most shocking and bizarre things I've ever seen in my life and the pod screams chill you to the bone. There's also a cameo by Kevin McCarthy the star of the 1956 version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the movie. I decided to watch it with my niece last night. And boy I really enjoyed it. It was a real good doom sci-fi that just turned the world into a dystopia...although I'd hardly call this a dystopian film.It was an alien invasion film plain and simple, with great acting and characters. Jeff Goldblum and Leonard Nimoy could be in the worst films and still bring something good to them, same with Donald Sutherland.I'm not even into remakes. I hate remakes because they just have a tendency to completely ignore the previous film or film series, basically establishing a "new universe." That being said, I never saw the original, so I had nothing to judge it by. I will probably see the original but I hope it is different enough from this film that I won't feel like I'm watching an older version of the same movie.All in all though, a great film...check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this to be creepy and scary in places. Much more so than the original version and the ending is truly chilling. It is more downbeat than the original too as the invaders win in this version.Donald Sutherland puts in a great performance. There is a feeling of menace about this film with some tense and creepy moments. The effects are good especially when we see the pods starting to resemble humans. I found the part where Sutherland discovers that Brooke Adams' character has been taken over scary.The ending is truly chilling or at least it was to me. Although half expected Sutherland is very scary when it becomes obvious that he has been taken over. This is a great ending although very downbeat as it creates the overriding impression that mankind will soon be wiped out. As I said totally different to the original. A good film with excellent performances. There is a feeling of foreboding coupled with unease, tension and creepiness throughout which certainly made me feel uneasy. The downbeat ending was also not what I was expecting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PLOT Some cauliflowers from outer space develop clones of humans, in order to replace them, while Donald Sutherland tries to frame up a local restaurant claiming that a caper is really a rat turd. The invasion spreads very quickly. Leonard Nimoy, a.k.a. Dr Spock, tries to contain it with marriage counselling sessions. Jeff Goldblum and his wife through mud bathings. And Brooke Adams by worrying very much and moving her pupils unsettlingly. Will our handful of heroes be able to defeat the aliens? MEANING Human relationships have become so alienated that we have mutually become aliens to each other. This concept is represented literally: humans are substituted for aliens. These aliens are cold and indifferent. They are the sci fi objectification of the sociological concepts expressed by Dr Spock ("we get in and out of relationships as if they meant nothing"). To the invasion of alien detachment is juxtaposed and opposed the human warmth of the leading couple, formed by Sutherland/Adams, which toward the end, particularly, declare with effusion and warmth their sentimental inclinations. But the alien coldheartedness looms over them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That rare thing - a very good remake of a great original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen Phililp Kaufman's film several times over the years - but always on t.v. or video, and viewing the blue-ray, which came out a while back but which I only just got around to watching last week, I'm struck by how clever the use of lighting and colour is in the movie; subtle but highly stylised. I've always liked it a lot, while thinking Don Siegel's 1956 movie a masterpiece. But it's unfair to compare the two. They attack the story from different eras and different directions.Donald Sutherland leads an interesting cast, including Brooke Adams, Leonard Nimoy, Veronica Cartwright and Jeff Goldblum. And they tell the story very well. Nimoy is relaxed, Sutherland manages to make a public health officer cool, and Goldblum and Cartwright are agreeably cooky. Adams is also very good here, showing vulnerability without being the stereotypical horror movie female.It's the story you'll remember, though, and rightly so. Jack Finney's classic tale has stood the test of time, and with the aid of excellent effects, so has the movie. And of course that final scene remarkably manages to match Kevin McCarthy's jolt down the highway in the original. He has a great cameo in this, doing exactly the same thing, and it's fun to spot Robert Duval and Don Siegel himself.Kaufman's direction is highly unusual and highly effective -shooting one scene early on in a hallway while the scene goes on inside a room, steadily tracking in - it actually makes an exposition scene interesting.Gripping, compelling, and yes, very frightening. So rare for a remake to be this good. Perhaps only Carpenter's The Thing has matched it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Respectable Remake is Almost an Oxymoron. But Not Here. This is One of the Few that Pay Homage and Creates its Own Thing from Another Thing, with Talent, Style, and "Originality".Everyone Working on This Film Contributes and the Result Made This Into Not Only an Update but a Movie that was Embraced by Critics and Audiences and Has Done Nothing But Gain in Reputation from Both Over the Years and at the Same Time Does Not Diminish the Original from Director Don Siegel in 1958.This is Communal Filmmaking at its Best. From the Script (W.D. Richter) Using Contemporary Subtext and Metaphor, to the Director Philip Kaufman Showing Flourishing Restraint and an Ultra-Hip Playfulness to the...Cinematography (Michael Chapman), to the Creepy and Unsettling Use of Score and Sound Effects (Denny Zeitlin and Ben Burtt), to the Actors Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, Jeff Goldblum, and Leonard Nimoy, and Veronica Cartwright, Each Delivering Interesting Characters with Intelligent Portrayals as Believable Individuals Caught Up in an Invasion that Removes Both Intellect and Oneness. The Homages are Plenty and Will Not Be Ruined Here. There are Certain Scenes, Cameos, and Dialog that Pay Tribute. The Style is All 1970's at its Most Rewarding and Artistic. The Horror Make-Up and Other SFX are Excellent for the Period and Show Some Restraint Considering the Era but When Done are Extremely Effective. It Starts with the Opening "Worlds in Collision" Space Shots and Continues Through Some Gory Shocks and Slimy Make-Up Work. Overall it is the Group Talent that Makes This One Come Together as an Excellent Stand-Alone and One of Those Rarities. The Respectable Remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rat turd, not a caper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, I'm not calling this movie a turd. It's actually a great movie, particularly for a remake. But the turd/caper scene, which occurs very early in the film, is one that stuck with me as a kid. For one thing I had no idea what a caper was. For another, every time my family went to a restaurant I worried there were rat droppings in my food. Anyway, back to the review. This is the first (and best) remake of the 1956 sci-fi classic of the same name. The plot, if you've been living under a rock, is that aliens are quietly replacing people with duplicates. The script is solid and Philip Kaufman's direction is excellent. Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, Leonard Nimoy, and Jeff Goldblum are all good. Veronica Cartwright steals pretty much every scene she's in. This is touted by some as being better than the original. I don't think that's the case but it is a great film that wisely avoids being a scene-for-scene remake (I hate those). It feels like much more of a horror movie (although the original was certainly scary for its time). Definitely recommended, whether you've seen the original or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the best Sci-Fi horror/thrillers of all time. In fact it should be among the best Sci-Fi films as well. Now it surprised me that this was a remake because it was extremely good, and remakes rarely are. Not since John Carpenters "the Thing" have I've seen such a good remake. The story is well written and the acting is great. Most of the credit should go to Donald Sutherland of course. Also we have Brooke Adams, Jeff Goldblum and Veronica Cartwright as the rest of the escapees. Also it was nice to finally see Leonard Nimoy doing something else than Spock from Star Trek. This movie definitely has him in a very different role.Now this is one of the reviews where I'm not going to bother to spoil anything by writing a synopsis. i think the IMDb synopsis speaks for itself. Plus, this is simply a must see film, please don't spoil anything for yourself. I had seen the ending before, ruined the fun a bit, but I feel that I still gave it a fear rating.The only negative parts of this film were, that it can be a little slow and repetitive. You can only run and hide for so long and keep it interesting. But still they always stopped it right before it got bad, and that saved the movie.I loved this movie. It was scary, suspenseful and damn right chilly. Good effects for it time, maybe a little dated but most people would hardly notice. I really can't say anything but, "watch it". If you're a Sci-Fi, thriller, horror or even a fan of Donald Sutherland, this is a must see movie. I give this movie a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent re-imagining of a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1978 re-imagining of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' is a classic in its own right. It's a brilliant example of how Hollywood could, on occasion during the Cold War, portray and reflect on the fears and anxieties of the American consciousness. The invaders could've been aliens or creatures from another realm; it didn't really matter. The force that takes over personifies America's fear of invasion from an intelligent and unrelenting hostile force. The aliens themselves could almost be an allegory for an enemy that America didn't really understand and therefore feared, namely, the Soviet regime. Throughout the film there are many scenes which give a clear indication of the deeply-set paranoia which was prevalent at the time. The score composed for this movie is excellent at conveying the fears, anxieties and paranoia of the characters. There are moments where the music almost becomes alien itself; an innovative use of synthesizers screeches erratically, changing pitch and speed according to the level of anxiety on-screen. It's especially poignant during the scenes which show the Invaders 'snatching' people.. The acting is, by most, excellent. There are a few scenes which are a little 'hammy' by our standards today, but for the most part Sutherland, Goldblum et al, do a fantastic job at conveying their frustration, anxiety and terror when they begin to realise the sheer magnitude of what's happening to the world around them. The cinematography is very well done with regards to the frenetic chase sequences, and frenzied emotionally-driven conversations. The most impressive and memorable sequences are the scenes involving the 'body snatchers'. The only film I can compare the alien visuals to is perhaps the 1982 remake of 'The Thing', where puppetry and cosmetics are unseen; only other-worldly and horrifying visuals prevail on-screen. Overall I'd say that this film is an excellent reflection of Cold War anxiety, and it translates the somewhat convoluted and laughably over-the-top plot of the original movie, into a movie which provokes fear and contemplation. The 1978 re-imagining of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' is a must-see for anyone who enjoys intelligent, tense and thought-provoking thrillers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Glutinous seed pods traverse by drifting across interstellar space, until finally coming across a planet suitable for habitat. Able to adapt the spore invasion takes the form of alien clones, taking over the memory and body of the host, leaving but an empty shell. The new human is devoid of independent emotion, hollow and focused on base survival. Among the first to notice changes occurring in people is Elizabeth Driscoll (Brooke Adams), whose lifetime partner Geoffrey Howell (Art Hindle) overnight changes from obstinate and excessively easy-going to orderly and focused. Elizabeth shares her doubts with her friend and co-worker at the Department of Health in San Francisco Matthew Bennell (Donald Sutherland). Soon together with their friends Jack (Jeff Goldblum) and Nancy Bellicec (Veronica Cartwright) become overwhelmed by the paranoia of being the only ones left...A dreadfully terrifying vision, the most subliminal in sci-fi history, allows "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" thrive through time, in a large part due to the unapologetically dark script coupled with grim settings and an unrelenting sense of detachment from reality. Grabbing under the skin with the sense of no escape and a growing terror of encirclement, the movie has lost none of its gripping appeal. Gloomy cinematography and special effects as if taken from the most disturbing Cronenberg body horror designs it remains an undying classic, unrivalled by future instalments. Gliding shots through alleys following feet of nameless clones counter-played with subtle lighting brings out an unmistakable dread as the heroes become increasingly cornered.That comes irregardless of sub-textual messages on society, including in my opinion the most timeless dilemma of the mass, the crowd syphoning emotion, diversity and inner innovation, subverting even the strongest individual into its machinations. Who an I? Is that question really relevant in the mass? Or is survival and the context of 'Who are we?' the only intuitively important question? Still one of the most efficient horror movies ever made, causing the skin to crawl and subconsciously forcing a short analysis of your loved ones as to whether they are still who they claim to be... :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"In an hour, you'll be one of us"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Philip Kaufman's 1978 remake of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' updates the story from a small fictional town to San Francisco. His film stresses the influence of Watergate and the Vietnam War in fuelling government mistrust, and casts the Pod-people as New Age fanatics (literally "flower children") who are disturbingly detached from reality. One implication of the film is that humans are open to invasion because citizens have become fragmented and alienated, searching desperately for a sense of belonging. Kaufman's canted cinematography evokes a potent sense of disorder and paranoia; even from the opening moments, the order of San Francisco is eerily askew, suggesting that the invasion is already well underway (Kevin McCarthy's cameo appearance is particularly unsettling).The 1950s film adaptation of War of the Worlds (Haskin, 1953) prominently featured religion as Mankind's ultimate saviour. Religion is largely absent from the 1956 'Body Snatchers,' but remains important as a defining characteristic separating "us" from "them". Conversely, in the 1978 film, religion is obliquely offered as a mode of conformity in direct association with the Pod-invasion: a priest (Robert Duvall) swings eerily on playground equipment, possibly a newly-transformed Pod- person ? one of the first, and so unacquainted with social customs. The ending, one of the most devastating in cinema history, is likely to disrupt your sleep patterns; silence over credits hasn't been used so well since Sidney Lumet's 'Fail-Safe (1964).'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie when I was about ten years old, so I don't remember much about it, other than that it struck an unpleasant nerve deep inside my subconscious somewhere that lasted until this day. Sure enough, it's been almost twenty years now and my perceptions may be a bit off, but reading some of the other comments, perhaps not. There's just something deeply unsettling about the whole movie, not to mention the ending, which will probably remain etched into my brain for the rest of my life. Makes me uncomfortable just thinking about it. Together with "Jaws" and "Gremlins", this is one of the films my parents shouldn't have let me watched. Anyway, there are so many movies today that are worth watching and probably better than this, but I'd still recommend it for a boring Sunday afternoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great sci-fi thriller that holds even after 30 years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other reviewers have adequately explained what makes this a good movie. I would just add that for a picture made in the 70s (and a science fiction movie at that) it holds up surprisingly well.To be sure, there are the 50s Red Scare elements from the original and some 70s New Age additions, (Spock as a touchy-feely psychiatrist, Veronica carrying on about how plants have feelings) but the story itself nails the universal and timeless fears of conspiracy, infiltration, and how horrifying it is when you know something is the matter but nobody will believe you.The casting is also strange but enjoyable. Donald Sutherland makes you wonder what ever happened to heroes who commanded a presence without being overly violent or even saying a lot. Jeff Goldblum plays the only character he has ever played: Jeff Goldblum. However, he is perfect in his quirky scrawniness for this kind of movie. Brooke Adams is probably at the apex of her long career here. She gets topless in the end for no apparent reason other than that's what used to happen in 70s science fiction movies. It was disconcerting to see Leonard Nimoy looking groovy with long hair, a turtleneck, and displaying facial emotion that Spock never did, but seeing Spock without pointy ears only adds to the viewer's uneasiness as the tension grows in the movie.Kevin McCarthy, the star of the original, has a good cameo as "Running Man." Jerry Garcia is also credited with playing the banjo. Makes sense. It was in San Francisco, after all.Sometimes, invasion and disaster movies leave you feeling like you are watching the news because the constant newscasts are used to "explain" to the characters and the viewer what is going on, as if something really didn't happen if a reporter wasn't there to document it. Aside from a few subtle newspaper clippings, this distracting phenomenon is absent from this movie and it is much better for it.Finally, it has one of the scariest endings in the history of cinema. It terrified me for weeks afterward when I first rented it as a pre-teen. It still gave me goosebumps the next time I saw it 20 years later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie on TV in my early teens and it really caught my eye. Since then I've seen it multiple times and I'm still convinced that it's one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made.Briefly, it's the story of a bunch of people who see the city around them gradually changing, people becoming distant and somehow cold. Paranoia and later panic ensues when they discover that people are being replaced with duplicates who have the same memories but no emotions. The acting from Donald Sutherland as Matthew is brilliant (and apparently effortless) and Brooke Adams does a great job as Elizabeth. I love the scene were Matthew is cooking for Elizabeth at his apartment and they end up talking outside - it's played very naturally and subtly shows the affection they have between them. When Elizabeth does 'that funny thing' with her eyes, it's a wonderful moment and gives a perfect respite from the paranoia. The whole scene gives us a peek at how enjoyable life is for the characters and makes us aware of what they have to lose. It's easy to like these characters.Veronica Cartwright as Nancy exudes a sense of foreboding mixed with panic as only she can - on this performance it's easy to see why she ended up playing Lambert in 'Alien.' The terror in her face is amazing and totally convincing.Jeff Goldblum puts in a fine turn as Jack - suitably creepy, quirky and funny all at once. He seems to have continued this in other movies but has never bettered this role so far in his career. Leonard Nimoy fits perfectly as the patronizing shrink Dr Kibner - he clearly found playing a logical analyst very familiar. Interestingly, on the DVD Director's commentary, Kaufman says that this was an attempt by Nimoy to break away from his type casting as Spock. He could have fooled me - this is just the Vulcan all over again but with a hint of malevolence. That's not to say he doesn't do a good job - he does everything right. Overall - a superb job by the entire cast.The film is shot to accentuate the feelings of paranoia and dread. Lots of hand held camera shots, offset angles and long takes add up to an organic feeling, like you're floating around the characters. When they're in the car, you're in the back seat. When they're all together in one room, you're moving amongst them. There's lots of opaque glass, plastic and mirrors in shot - characters are often seen behind them and obscured so only an outline or a shadow is visible. It all adds to the strange feeling. The lighting is amazing with the great use of shadows and colours - check out the use of blue and green in lots of different scenes. A lot is lit from below or from a strange angle.The special effects are pretty good but are kept to a minimum - this isn't a flashy movie - it's about suspense and the feeling of hopelessness, not action sequences.The sound track is just as off beat as the rest of the movie. It's minimal but there at the right moments, often consisting of pulsating noises or strange keyboard melodies. It fits just right and id one of the best things about this movie.The ending is fantastic. If you haven't seen it, don't read anymore reviews of the movie as if it's spoilt you'll regret it. Suffice it to say that it's one of the bravest and mind blowing endings ever.I can hardly fault this film - perhaps there's a few action scenes towards the end that slightly disrupted the menacing feeling, but overall it's a true classic of it's genre. A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this film! The ´70s must have been the greatest decade in american cinema! (I happen to live door-to-door with a cinema that frequently shows classic films like this, and I end up going there a couple of times a week. And mostly end up renting, for a quarter of the price, the bad Hollywood films that plague the European cinemas.)Just think about what great films the ´70s gave us, everything from ´The French Connection´ to Star Wars´. Body Snatchers feels like a typical ´70s thriller, down- to- earth storytelling with a natural feeling of reality. What´s so special about this Science fiction classic is that it manages to give an believable portrait of how easy it is for us to turn a blind eye. Even when people change over night, (which they do here thanks to the body snatchers) we hardly bother to wonder why.It doesn´t take a genius to draw parallels to the totalitarian ideologies that plagued the ´70s, everything from the Soviet Union to Pinochets Chile. But what´s so typically ´70s, and in turn makes this a great social portrait, is that they didn´t seem to be obsessed with making films that avoided being scary and uncomfortable. Here you can truly feel the paranoia, Donald Sutherland gives an great performance, and the terror of the characters. What gives this film a slot in my top ten science fiction/thriller is the fantastic ending. Even if your not used to the slow pace and the greyish tones, give it a chance. When you see the last scene you will know what I´m talking about!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw `Body Snatchers` as a young child when it appeared on television. It led to the only time in my childhood when I had repeated trouble sleeping, and left me questioning aspects of life in general for the first time.When discussing films, I found my boyfriend had identical memories of `Body Snatchers`, so we spent many months looking until we found a copy (It was deleted at the time). Never have I been so chilled. Things I`d forgotten, like the strange astral introduction, the scary trees or the bagpipe music emanating from the ship, flooded back almost against my will. We both braced ourselves for the `hybrid` dog which had haunted us for two decades. Oh sh*t! No warning, it came like a ton of bricks in the face, and took me right back to my irrational childhood fears (I don`t want to be a doggy, daddy!)The film does merit at least two viewings. Second time round the plot developments, direction and twists may be appreciated more. This is a film which affected my life, by scareing me beyond belief. It made me aware of the power of a well-directed film, and I became a movie-lover as a result. I also became a regular visitor to San Francisco, partially to satisfy my obsession with the city, which started with viewing this film. If you haven`t seen it yet, buy or rent it, and savour your first viewing (I recommend not to watch alone, or when near bedtime!)</fullReview>

Particularly noticeable sequences include Jeff Goldblum's unfortunate sacrifice to save his friends to Leonard Nimoy's attitude change from a warm doctor to an emotionless drone. Donald Sutherland is excellent in his role as the health inspector with one hell of a supporting cast. Unlike the original, the drones scream when they see a real person.

		<fullReview>"The marginal man is one whom fate has condemned to live in two societies and in two, not merely different, but antagonistic cultures. His mind is the crucible in which two different and refractory cultures may be said to melt and, either wholly or in part, fuse." - Robert ParkIn Don Siegel's "The Invasion of The Body Snatchers" (1956), a group of hostile aliens attempt to take over a small Californian town. The film used a "cultural invasion" from outer space to symbolise the annihilation of "individuality" or "free personality" in contemporary society.Philip Kaufman's 1979 remake, however, sees "cultural invasion" as a blend of what sociologist Robert Park called "migrations" and "passive movements". Migration as a mass movement usually entails either a certain amount of cultural conquest (economic or political) or assimilation, whereas passive movements represent a more individualised negotiation of cultural boundaries. In other words, in Kaufman's film we have the migrating aliens actively displacing humans, whilst we have the humans attempting to survive by acting like aliens who are themselves acting like humans. For both groups, conformity thus becomes a kind of fake parody of humanity. A never-ending cycle of mimicry in which you attempt to fit in with someone who is himself trying to fit in.In Don Siegel's 1956 film, actor Kevin McCarthy stumbles out onto a street and yells "They're here!", warning townsfolk of the alien invasion. In Kauffman's film, the same Kevin McCarthy appears in a busy urban street. The relocation of the alien invasion from rural town to urban mega-city marks an important shift. By placing the invasion within a metropolitan centre the sharp distinctions between ethnic groups (Blacks, Irish, Italian, Japanese, American etc) are down played whilst the question of the individual as Other within the large, alienating convolutions of a modern landscape takes precedence. In the modern world, individuality as a means of defining oneself against any number of groups becomes lost within the ubiquitous streamlining of social, ethnic, and religious differences, everyone essentially becoming the same in their differences. In Kaufman's next film, "The Wanderers", he again has a character yelling "They're here!", this time when a virus-like gang called "The Duckies" appear. In response, several rival Bronx gangs band together (recognising the various traits, morals and codes that unite them) and attempt to fight off the "foreign" invaders.Significantly, the lead characters in Kaufman's "Invasion" are all oddballs. Donald Sutherland plays a civil servant, another plays a poet, another a spa owner and another a New Age Guru. Living on the fringes, they all position themselves against what they see to be an encroaching conformity. Unlike everyone else in San Francisco ? the city in which the film is set ? they refuse to bend to societal pressures, shame, and the fear of being different.The choice of setting the film in San Francisco is itself important. This was the last stand of the hippies, the "freaks", the flower power movement. But eventually even they gave up and became just like everyone else, the Baby Boomers bulldozed by mid-century techno-capitalism, consumed by the Great American fantasy, voting ultra-conservative and morphing into the drone-like Yuppies of the 1980s. In this way the film represents the dying gasp of the 1960's, flower power idealism suffocated, ironically, by alien plant spores and intergalactic flower pods. Kaufman lays this theme on thick with his allegorical plot, in which the "truthseers" and "outsiders" eventually "fall asleep" and "become just like everyone else", vegetative, passive, thoughtless and, as one character says, without "substance or detail".Today, in an age when corporate power defines image and "alternative lifestyles" are themselves pick-and-mix commodities, "individualism" itself no longer seems to exist. Early in the film, one character says that nobody has meaningful conversations anymore, nobody really listens, nobody ever knows anybody absolutely. Unlike Siegel's film, with its quaint Californian town, Kaufman's urban city is one in which it is increasingly difficult to spot the pod people, because blank faces are the norm and neighbours are themselves all alien. The larger the community, the less of a community it is, man most alone when he's surrounded by large, unprocessable groups of people. Who can you trust, Kaufman asks, in a world that is increasingly isolated, alienated, passionless and self-absorbed? Who's real when all behaviour is dictated by the sales-desk?Incidentally, the film's central motif is a web of cracks on the hero's car windscreen. On the cusp of globalisation, the film's heroes are happy to resist homogeneity by being crackpots, fragmented from the whole. Flash forward several decades, and the latest "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" movie (simply titled "Invasion" and staring Nicole Kidman) portrays an even more frightening horror. In this future world, where globalisation has led to the pods taking over every country on the planet, the message is now a kind of rational acceptance of the aliens: be thankful that we're all spaced-out pod people, because resistance is too damn stressful. Kaufman's "Invasion" was released in the 1970s, a decade in which even big budget films crackled with a certain gritty, neorealism. His film is low-key, grungy, and even his movie stars seem like "real people" (the glamorous Brooke Adams excluded). The film's sound design is also special, especially one humorous/sublime scene in which "Amazing Grace" plays at a shipyard. The film is also part of a wave of 1970s paranoid conspiracy thrillers ("Chinatown", "All the President's Men", "Parallax View", "They Might Be Giants" etc), of which it is one of the best.8.9/10 - Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting, but incomplete script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had a collection of great actors, especially Donald Sutherland and Leonard Nimoy. Sutherland plays a health inspector, who very slowly finds out that these aliens have infected San Francisco through flowering plants that grow pods to replace humans when they fall asleep. At first, Sutherland doesn't believe his colleague (Brooke Adams) when she says her husband is now a complete different person. In fact, her husband is now an alien clone with no emotions. Slowly, but surely, the health inspector sees signs that San Francisco is slowing being taken over by these alien clones.However, the trouble I had was how many questions were unanswered. For example, was this invasion by these alien spores (that eventually created the pods that became alien clones). For example, Sutherland's character destroys his pod. How then is he replaced in the end? Doesn't destroying one's pod mean that you will fall asleep and not be replaced by your clone? Was this invasion just in San Francisco originally, or did the alien spores land all over the World? Why were there normal people still in the "red light" district, but aliens in other parts of the city? When, at the end, Sutherland's character destroys the pod producing plant, what is the significance? Was this the only pod producing plant in the World, or were there already numerous pod producing plants all over the World? I loved the ending of the movie and the acting, but I felt that the script left too many questions unanswered. It was as though Kaufman, the director, assumed that we had already read the book and seen the original 1956 version. I felt confused, and had all these questions. That interfered with my enjoyment of the movie, and made me give in just a slightly above average rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No movie more influential than INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forgive me the slight exaggeration of the title, I'm only trying to get butts into seats.But seriously. If we are to accept NOTLD as the unspoken dividing barrier between traditional and modern horror; if we acknowledge that Romero's pioneering brand of zombie apocalypse, a unique blend that marries the visceral to the psychological and the claustrophobic to the allegoric, owes more to the original INVASION (and THE LAST MAN ON EARTH without doubt) than other proto-zombie excursions; if we furthermore track the evident influence Kaufman's INVASION had to modern apocalyptic horrors like 28 DAYS LATER and the DAWN remake, the running drones (which also predate Lenzi's custard-in-the-face crude zombies from NIGHTMARE CITY), the hair-raising howling and screeching and the atmosphere of clinical paranoia; and finally if we guesstimate the "don't fall asleep" angle to have played no small role in inspiring Craven's NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET - then I believe we can arrive safely to the conclusion that the two INVASIONS from '56 and '78 combined rank among the most hugely influential films in horror history, deserving of a place right there alongside PSYCHO, NOTLD and the original Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE.Kaufman's remake piles impending doom upon chilling paranoia and tension upon tension. The acting is great all around and the plot moves along with surgical precision, Kaufman turning his narrative screw a little tighter every time increasing the pitch of claustrophobic tension. There are minor flaws to be found, the jarred and obtrusive music and Kaufman's unassured direction chief among them, but overall I think we have in our hands that rare thing in movies: a remake which not only has a perfectly good reason to exist but has the creative gall to stand side by side with the original, if not surpass it in certain aspects.My only gripe with Kaufman's adaptation, and it has little to do with what I wrote above but I feel the need to rant a little more, is Kaufman's direction. There's something very haphazard in the way he shoots the picture, as though he's not quite sure at times what to do with his camera so he just randomly moves it around. Updating the "red menace" to a more faceless clinical background works wonders but there's something missing that would transform it into a surefire masterpiece. For some reason I was thinking how AWESOME it would be if Kubrick was in the director's chair. If he could turn a solid but rather formulaic story about an alcoholic writer going batsh#t crazy in a deserted hotel into a fullblown masterpiece of sensory horror then imagine what he could have done with the endless political allegories at play here. It would have been surely one for the ages, right there along with A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and DR. STRANGELOVE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Urban Paranoia and Social Alienation Trigger the Fear Factor in a Classic Take on the Pod People</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen Philip Kaufman's ("The Right Stuff") supremely chilling 1978 movie in thirty years, so the 2007 DVD is a great excuse to revisit one of the most atmospheric and thematically intriguing sci-fi thrillers I have ever seen. Ostensibly a remake of the low-budget 1956 classic, this version foregoes the former's allegorical references to the then-prevalent Red Scare in favor of a post-Watergate mindset of escalating urban paranoia set most appropriately in the Mecca of acceptable non-conformity, San Francisco. Kaufman and cinematographer Michael Chapman ("Raging Bull") effectively evoke an off-kilter world overtaken by an encroaching sense of disquiet with a heavy use of crooked camera angles and elongated shadows that make the film downright noirish. Moreover, thanks to W.D. Richter's sharp screenplay, the film has a hip, almost blackly comic tone that makes a nice contrast to the scarifying situation being depicted. Overall, I find this film more entertaining than the original.The macabre plot begins with health inspector Matthew Bennell and his colleague Elizabeth Driscoll, who encounter a strange, unidentifiable flower they see growing everywhere. At the same time, people all over the city, including Elizabeth's boyfriend and the local dry cleaner, are acting peculiarly distant and devoid of emotion. It eventually dawns on Matthew and Elizabeth that aliens in the form of plant pods are slowly replacing the local populace with robotic duplicates. Accompanied by their mud-bath-owning friends Jack and Nancy Bellicec, they are determined to find a way to escape the city before they fall asleep and become transformed into pod-derived automatons. What makes this version particularly compelling is the palpable idea that you can live in a city amid thousands of indifferent strangers and see how easily an increasing army of pod people can infiltrate it without much resistance. Even though the method of dehumanization is far-fetched, the theme resonates because the macro-level trend is happening in a more figurative sense even more now than in 1978.You wouldn't expect the acting to be noteworthy in what may seem like a genre thriller, but the offbeat cast is razor-sharp. As Matthew, Donald Sutherland effectively plays an uncharacteristically sympathetic part, and his eccentric screen persona works particularly well in this context. Coming off of Terence Malick's acclaimed "Days of Heaven", Brooke Adams, with her distinctively throaty voice, gives a smart, watchful performance as Elizabeth, the character who first notices that something is amiss. The interplay between Sutherland and Adams has a quirky-funny chemistry that brings an unexpected comic element to the film. Jeff Goldblum ("The Fly") and Veronica Cartwright ("Alien") are no strangers to this genre, and they play Jack and Nancy with customary skill. Even Leonard Nimoy lends credibility as the know-it-all psychiatrist David Kibner, who tries to convince everyone that the strange goings-on reflect a mass psychological delusion. We know that's not true, and the scenes of the pod transformations, especially the key one in Bennell's garden, have that uniquely phantasmagoric effect that manages to be gross, scary and oddly amusing at the same time. Ironically, the film sags somewhat during the overextended chase scenes, and the piercing screams of the pods seem like a conventional touch for such a unique work. However, the final few minutes are well worth the wait. I live a few minutes away from the locale of that final shot, and I can't tell you how many times my friends and I have replicated that scene.The two-disc 2007 DVD is a welcome package of an under-appreciated film. The first disc provides the movie with an optional commentary track from Kaufman, a holdover from the original 1998 DVD. Kaufman is relatively low-key in his recollections, but he provides insight into the film's underlying themes, the creativity he had to encourage to produce the low-budget special effects, the challenge of using San Francisco locations, and the inclusion of cameos from Kevin McCarthy and Don Siegel, the star and director of the 1956 original. The second disc contains four featurettes, as well as the original theatrical trailer. The first is a cheeky retrospective look at the production, the sixteen-minute "Re-Visitors from Outer Space, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Pod", which describes Kaufman's rationale and approach in updating the 1956 original. Kaufman, Sutherland and Cartwright, among others, are interviewed. The second short is not as interesting, "Practical Magic: The Special Effects Pod", only five minutes long, which gives a cursory look at how some of the special effects were created before the convenience of CGI. Sound designer Ben Burtt is the subject of the third short, "The Man Behind the Scream: The Sound Effects Pod", as he explains how he created the gaseous pod-birthing noises and the unique scream of the pod people when they identify unaltered humans. Chapman discloses the influence of film noir in his camera-work in the five-minute "The Invasion Will Be Televised: The Cinematography Pod".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Philip Kaufman's chilling take on "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" has range, depth, emotion (a dangerous thing), and state-of-the-art visuals (effects and normal shots alike). It still remains the best adaptation of a story that has been beaten to death (thanks mostly now to Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig).This particular adaptation is more about average seventies paranoia than anything else, with Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, Jeff Goldblum, and Veronica Cartwright as people who realize something is wrong when they start to notice the people around them changing. Leonard Nimoy gives his best non-Spock performance as Dr. David Kibner, a psychiatrist (psychologist? I always get them confused) who doesn't believe in their wild stories even though there's really nothing that wild about them on the surface.So, yes, everybody's changing. And it's all thanks to plantlike aliens that migrate to Earth on solar winds (explained here in a visually stunning opening sequence). Sadly, the action occasionally shifts to clunky, and Kibner's attitude really begins to irritate after a while. But kudos to everybody-- particularly Cartwright-- for helping to make this a highly memorable invasion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It has set a precedent for how a remake should be - advanced, though respectful to its predecessor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As has been made apparent to us before, creating a worthy book-to-film adaptation is very difficult. That being said, remaking a model book-to-film adaptation is nearly impossible. Philip Kaufman, award-winning director and gifted screenwriter, upgrades on Siegel's adaptation ? also called 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' ? of Jack Finney's 1955 sci-fi novel, 'The Body Snatchers,' while simultaneously offering homage to it. This longer, more in-depth remake also expands on the terror of the first, creating a more modern visual exploration of what scares us the most: a worldwide conspiracy, in which we are the ones everyone's out to get.Kaufman's film, similar to Siegel's, focuses on a health inspector named Matthew Bennell (Dr. Miles Bennell in the original), played by Donald Sutherland, who, along with co-worker Elizabeth Driscoll (Brooke Adams) and friends Jack and Nancy Bellicec (Jeff Goldblum and Veronica Cartwright), realizes that citizens of the San Francisco area, where he lives, are being duplicated by alien pods, which copy their human victims while they sleep, then discard their bodies. As the invasion spreads sporadically, Bennell tries to inform others of his terrifying discovery, only to find that everyone already knows? and is a part of it.Masterful in the art of adaptation, Kaufman gives this translation what original novelist Jack Finney envisioned while writing his paranoid classic: fear, suspense and temperamental anxiety. Sutherland and Adams share the spotlight and both do so very convincingly, whereas Jeff Goldblum, expert on paranoid studies ('The Fly,' 'Jurassic Park'), gives the film a necessary idiosyncratic character, contributing much of the film's humor, whilst heightening it's level of neurosis.Philip Kaufman's 'Invasion' has set a precedent for how a remake should be ? advanced, though respectful to its predecessor. Not taking anything from the '56 version, which still stands as one of American cinema's most monumental achievements, Kaufman's deft writing ability heaves this remake to the top of the seventies' sci-fi list in an era shared with definitive masterpieces such as Ridley Scott's 'Alien,' and Tarkovsky's 'Stalker.' Embrace the apprehension that the film strives for, for if you do, you, too, will begin to see the world through skeptical, suspicious, and very terrified eyes; and you'll love it!</fullReview>

Here, in a creepy and nearly oppressive (but entertaining) re-envisioning of the first film, the concept of alien pod people taking over human life on earth is beautifully blended in with the style of paranoia films that were so popular in the 70's. Films like "3 Days of the Condor", "The Stepford Wives" and "Damian: The Omen II" (among many others) made it clear that no one can be trusted. This one joins right in as one day in San Francisco, directly following a rainstorm, various people no longer seem to behave as they did previously. Adams' casual, sports-nut boyfriend (Hindle) is suddenly all business. All over town, people are claiming that their spouses are not themselves any more. Adams' fellow Health Department employee Sutherland starts to investigate the situation, but is confronted with either disbelief from higher authorities or an overly jaded outlook from friends, such as psychologist Nimoy. Soon, Sutherland, Adams, Nimoy and married couple Goldblum and Cartwright begin to feel as if they are the only "regular" people left in the city and they must scramble to find a solution to the epidemic cloning of citizens! But how far has the conspiracy of the takeover spread and is there a way to defeat the pod people? Sutherland and Adams give terrific, believable performances in this sometimes agonizingly unsettling film. They (along with Goldblum and Cartwright) are given intriguingly human idiosyncrasies that make them characters to root for when everyone around them begins to turn robotic. Nimoy is also believable as the somewhat detached doctor who has trouble believing what is happening around him. Goldblum gets a strong early role as a sensitive, philosophical man who finds himself up against the unknown. Cartwright (who cut her teeth on the supernatural as a child in "The Birds" and would later kick it up a notch further in "Alien") is excellent here. She manages to encompass everything from quirkiness to vulnerability to strength to despair and even fearsomeness in her portrayal of a woman struggling to deal with such bizarre circumstances. Everything about the movie (it's odd lighting, innovative camera angles, enhanced ambient sounds, moody music) is designed to create tension and unease and it succeeds admirably. Continually, in the background, elements of what is happening in San Francisco can be seen. The concept of the aliens beginning as tiny little flowers and evolving into large birth-giving pods is presented in a way that may make people think twice before going out to weed their flower beds, particularly after a rainfall. The special effects, created before CGI, are rudimentary, but extremely creepy and effective. Just as the characters become afraid to fall asleep, some viewers may feel reluctant to doze off after viewing this one (especially if there's a house plant nearby!) Robert Duvall (a friend of the director) has a tiny cameo as an unusually stone-faced priest in the beginning of the film. The original film's director (Siegal) and star (McCarthy) each have small, effective roles as well. There are occasional holes in the logic/plot, and nothing can change the first film's place in sci-fi history, but this can stand proudly by it as a remake that compliments the original and in some ways improves on it. That isn't always the case as so many rotten remakes have proved over the years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fun engaging &amp; still very creepy &amp; suspenseful remake of the 1956 film has the alien pods taking people over in San Francisco with a public health inspector &amp; his friends aware of the invasion. Within time, the 4 people realize that they have no one to trust but themselves &amp; race to stop the duplicates before they fulfill their plan in taking over the entire world. In a way this isn't really a remake, it's more like a re-imagining of the original film &amp; while it does slow down in spots, it's a worthy enough remake that holds up well to the original black &amp; white classic. Definitely a creepy movie &amp; one that is highly recommended. Followed by a less successful remake in 1993 called BODY SNATCHERS: THE INVASION CONTINUES &amp; another remake on the way!**** (stars)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Remake That Surpasses the Original, and All Other Versions Since</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Philip Kaufman's remake of The Invasion of the Body Snatchers is an excellent film in its own right that improves upon the original. Where as the 1950s version was a standard B-movie, the remake features an excellent cast and film direction that raises it above the level of a typical sci-fi horror movie.In particular, the film owes a heavy debt to the paranoia thrillers of the early to mid 1970s, such as Klute and All the President's Men. The use of camera angles and music to create an atmosphere of genuine dread is extremely skillful. Denny Zeitlin's synthesizer score is classic, and makes one wish he had done more film scores.The cast, as mentioned above, is a stand out, and plays a major role in raising this film to the level of a classic. Donald Sutherland, as usual, gives a bravura performance, while Brooke Adams makes an appealing female lead. However, the true stand out of the cast is Veronica Cartwright, who plays a smarter than she seems sci-fi buff who knows an alien invasion when she sees one. The cast as a whole gives their characters an empathy which makes the viewer care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finely constructed science fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The people of San Francisco are being duplicated by an alien organism and replaced while they sleep with an emotionless copy. A handful of citizens who realise the truth try to escape the invasion.Opening with a distant planet and it's life-form's journey to earth with its spore spouting (thanks to some well executed) effects, it's a quality production. Like it's 1956 predecessor what's interesting is the refreshing angle how a scifi invasion flick can be handled without spaceships and green men. As well as the number of subtexts to discover there's also a San Francisco undertone of a city changing. Here so convincingly true to life are the expected reactions including terror, humour and wit from the characters. It's relevant covering inherent fears of paranoia which is probably a testament to why the 1978 version is so well regarded.A lot of attention has gone into the background activities on display as the characters discover something is not quite right, there is great self aware camera work and realistic settings, natural lighting and so on, it's hard not to like director Philip Kaufman's finely constructed science fiction. Overall, subtle in places, it's intense in others with chases and effective hard hitting scenes featuring ghastly half formed pod people, including a part man part dog alien. The special effects holdup and are still creepy.Complete with a cameo for Kevin McCarthy of the original this is both Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams (complete with hairy armpits) arguably finest performances, with the likes of energetic Jeff Goldblum, Veronica Cartwright and Leonard Nimoy in their respective supporting roles. Thanks to a convincing script from W.D. Richter, Kaufman's fine direction coupled with Jack Finney's solid novel source material and the natural delivery of the actors, Invasion of the Body Snatchers is still a credible, mature and tour de force of mistrust and conspiracy.A must see for serious science fiction fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I'm going to be consistent, I have to rate this film lower than the original, even though it builds it's suspense quicker and has a competent cast. The main problem I have is that the story doesn't maintain a continuity regarding the behavior of the aliens taking over San Francisco's human population. During the opening of the picture, we're treated to these spooky tendrils that form a weblike pattern on plants, in the mud bath parlor a fully formed replacement body is decked out on a massage table, and there are subsequent scenes of pods disgorging human replicants. "They get you when you sleep" seems to be the operative manner in which the aliens take over, but the picture itself offers all those other alternatives.I'll say one thing I noticed though, as far back as 1978 when this film was made the movie industry was showing it's ideological bias by equating Republicans with having an affair, contracting a social disease, and heavens forbid, being gay! If the picture were remade today, that gay reference would never even be considered; come to think of it, liberal Hollywood doesn't have much of a problem with the other two issues either. So I guess that leaves Republicans as the lone surviving villains today.Getting back to that body at the Bellicec mud parlor - can anybody explain why Jack (Jeff Goldblum) would have made an observation that the 'creature' on the massage table didn't have fingerprints? What reasonable person would have been thinking about fingerprints at a time like that, when you had a potentially dead body in a public place of business?Through it all Matthew Bennell (Donald Sutherland) maintains his unwavering belief that he and Elizabeth (Brooke Adams) can save mankind and humanity by coming up with a way to destroy the pod people. He makes a valiant go of it, but help me out here - it seems like the writers couldn't figure out for a way for this film to end, so they just ended it by Bennel turning into one of 'them'! Lights out, cut, and make that a wrap - talk about a let-down ending.But you know, the movie did have it's genuinely scary elements, like dial telephones, Seventies hair styles and that previously mentioned mud bath parlor. Nancy Bellicec (Veronica Cartwright) managed to make her way through a really creepy scene giving a massage to that totally bloated fat guy who couldn't get out of the tub by himself, but you want to know the eeriest? Can Brooke Adams really do that with her eyes?!?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this movie I did not truly no what to expect. I'm not a huge fan of science fiction but Donald Sutherland is a great actor. At first the movie didn't strike me as very interesting but as the movie progressed it seemed like the perfect movie set up telling the story of a few people alone as the only pure humans. After watching the movie (which I enjoyed very much) it drew my attention to the original 50s classic made by the great director Don Siegel. Once again I found myself engrossed in the story. Both movies feature the emotions people feel in a disaster situation. Both movies also featured great character development, although I still think the remake does more so considering its length. Invasion of the Body Snatchers is possibly the greatest sci-fi/horror flick I've seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Remakes of All Time....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually remakes don't work. They're poor substitutes for the original which may have worked because of some odd quirk in casting, direction or subject matter and/or timing of release. That certainly would seem the case with the original "Invasion of the Body Snatchers". Released in 1956 during the hellish days of rabid anti communism, its story was said to be a metaphor about the perils of socialism and its dehumanizing effects. Whatever. The 1978 remake takes the basic premise and makes the material very much its own. There's just enough homage paying to the original (such as Kevin McCarthy's brief but effective cameo) so the film makers don't seem like they're unaware of or belittling (disrespecting) the source material. But they're not making a carbon copy either. The mood is entirely its own and it is creepy as hell. What's so good about it? The cast (especially Brooke Adams and Sutherland), Kaufman's understated but controlled direction and the films pacing which gets right into the story straight away. But the film's dire mood is what makes it so effective: you feel just as panicky as Adams does at the bookstore when Sutherland takes her to see Leonard Nimoy's Dr. David Kibner. You don't want what she's feeling and sensing to be true but it is and as the tension and suspense escalates, the film turns from a paranoid thriller to a horror movie.This has been one of my favorite films for years and just seeing it again recently on MGM/HD (in pristine condition) made me realize how good it was.</fullReview>

I've seen this one now i think like 3 or 4 times, and i swear that it just seems to get better and better every time that i watch it. It is packed with a lot of drama and suspense, there isn't much "drag" time in this movie at all,, the performance by Donald Sutherland is classic,, Oscar worthy if you ask me,, Jeff Goldblum is in this one, and does a very good job,, Leonalrd Nimoy is also in here so there is a very decent cast in here that does know how to act , and yes it does show up on the big screen very well, i also think that this movie has one of the best horror endings of all time, , This one will shock you,, maybe even gross you out a bit,, i think that all horror fans should watch this version at least once in their lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best horror films are the ones that stay with you long after they're over. Hollywood had lost the ability to produce crawling horror until very recently when The Others marked a return to form.This move is a bona fide classic. Yes it's a remake of the famous 1956 movie where are handful of people come to realise that the human race is being taken over by emotionless alien invaders, but this time round things are very different.Those familiar with the original will see the plot develop down seemingly familiar lines. But a couple of minutes in, it starts to dawn on us that the main characters aren't the first to notice the subtle changes in everyone around them, they're the LAST. Brooke Adams walks through a park where a teacher is instructing her children to take the toxic pods home with them. Unexplained crowds of people chase a terrified man down the street as she walks to work. Refuse collectors are everywhere, disposing of human hosts. A face stares impassively through the frosted glass of a window. Kevin McCarthy's anguished warning falling on the deaf ears of Sutherland and Adams and his death watched by unmoved onlookers. The damage has already been done long before she and her friends catch on.It's this sense of helplessness, the knowledge that the alien takeover has happened right under everyone's noses that really makes the flesh creep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Semi-faithful remake to the original with a few deft touches.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Synopsis: Remake of the sci-fi classic transplants the story from small town California to San Francisco. A health inspector and his small, intimate circle of friends begin noticing bizarre behavior of their fellow citizens when they start showing no emotion. They uncover a conspiracy to wipe out the human race with clones completely free of emotion. This race of beings are descending upon them fast as day by day, the city by the Bay is becoming headquarters for the clones.Review: Absolutely creepy in the way it's told. Philip Kaufman and the writing team have crafted a seriously creepy film that has a few deft touches to it. It still maintains a somewhat faithful storyline, taking the characters from the original and putting them in San Francisco, many of the plot conventions that happened with the Siegel version are put in, and a few new touches are put in. There's more of an emphasis on paranoia, as strange people become the eyes and ears of the city. Donald Sutherland is impressive in his role as the less than likable to restaurants health inspector. He provides the soul of a character who doesn't realize the rope he's hanging on is getting smaller by the minute. Leonard Nimoy breaks typecasting as a sympathetic doctor who may not be who he seems to be anymore. Brooke Adams provides the right chemistry to Sutherland's lead character as a sensitive scientist becoming aware of her own boyfriend's odd behavior. Jeff Goldblum before he became famous (or joined a gym) is well cast as the uptight friend with Veronica Cartwright as his uptight wife. The ending is a real surprise and there are some seriously creepy sequences. Look fast for Robert Duvall in a non-speaking role as well as the film's original star and director, Kevin McCarthy and Don Siegel. Director Philip Kaufman pops up twice as the voice of a city official on a phone, and you'll see him as a man with a hat who walks up to Donald Sutherland in a phone booth. Very creepy, and an ending just as shocking as what the original's intended version would have been.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Body Snatchers is a piece of original work re-invented in 1978 by Philip Kaufman with great analysis. The setting moves from a small town to a expedition in the city of San Francisco. Plant pods from the unknown make their presence valid by landing in one's backyard. Once picked and absorbed, the contents of the substance enters the bodily construction, renouncing a new developed specie. They travel like flies and everyone that makes contact is transformed into a non-feeling, zoned out living organism. Many are taken under, but I will not give into details of the victims. Story unfolds when Brooke Adams discovers a flower in her backyard and brings it into the house for boyfriend Art Hindle to see. The next morning, her boyfriend is somewhat "Changed" and Adams is confused from it. Soon after, she notices the whole town has changed... like a cold take over of the soul. She tells Donald Sutherland about her dilemma and they set out to find information. This in turn, leads to a great adventure of humans versus alien abductors through out the city. This is a mix of suspense and thrills that should enchant the mystery minded individual. The original was first predicated with Kevin McCarthy running through out both films. A really cool idea. If you want more on this puzzle linked film, check it out when possible. It is a second-rate classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERSWhat a surprisingly good update this is. The direction is tremendous, mixing elongated images, mirror shots, aerial takes, skewed angles and point of view but never so that it's audacious.Some of the plot elements are arguably contrived ? a complete stranger telling Donald Sutherland "That not my wife" in the middle of a launderette, for one ? though the unclaimed attraction between the two leads keeps the momentum going until the events of the film are allowed to take over.The use of music, combined with unusual technique ? the camera focussing for too long on seemingly irrelevant bystanders, for example ? creates a palpable sense of unease. Though often the characters in the film are more scared than we are, which isn't always logical. "Just don't fall asleep" Goldblum is told by his wife. How does she know that that falling asleep would cause the husk to take over his life? No one tells her this, unless she's just watched the original on cable. Maybe she's just a big girl's blouse and is too stared to be awake on her own. This "characters jumping at their own shadow" technique is very effective, but when you think about it often makes little sense to the people in the film itself.Perhaps not having an issue helps. The (still very fine) 50s original was the epitome of red menace propaganda. Here Invasion acts only as a late 70s take on social alienation. If there's a worry that the antiquated title was too old for the era then it's quickly forgotten with convincing performances and a sensitive treatment. "Don't be trapped by old concepts," says David (Leonard Nimoy) at one point, and to its credit the film never is.The picture is almost universally dark, lightbulbs illuminating only themselves and none of their surrounding environment. It's a crucial element, and one that adds magnificently to the work. European direction combined with a literate script makes this a superb achievement. When a couple are in a bedroom, the camera stays respectfully, and statically, just outside the door. And look out for the stationary shot of the massage parlour, going on for longer than should be necessary, with only a hissing sound to be heard, yet unseen. This is a horror film that knows that less is more. The only thing that holds it back from becoming a first-class SF thriller is that really stupid and unnecessary scene with the man's head on the dog's body ? I mean, why?? (Maybe it wouldn't have seemed so silly at the time, released pre-Mars Attacks!) And did we really need that topless shot of Brooke Adams at the end? For an intelligent, adult suspenser that tastefully avoids schlock and gore it seems out of place. And maybe I would have found the whole thing more enjoyable if I hadn't accidentally seen the twist ending before the rest of the film. That said, this is still an excellent work, with Ben Burtt's special sound effects well worth a mention, as is allowing the end credits to play out without sound. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the scariest sci fi films I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really! I recall seeing this movie when it came out. I was about 8 years old and the movie scared the living daylights out of me. I couldn't sleep for weeks! I saw this movie just recently and now i have trouble sleeping again. It's on of my all time favorite sci fi thrillers.First of all this movie is not a remake. It's more like a continuation of the first (also recommended) version. The basic story is the same. Aliens invading human bodies. The same paranoia is still thee. Although instead of the paranoia of the 50's (communism) it uses more of a paranoia of the 70's (watergate, cointemplo) to relay the same sense of foreboding dread.The direction by Philip Kaufman, who later directed movies like the right stuff and unbearable lightness of being is excellent. The weird camera angles, the use of mirrors and drab settings, (was it me or where everyday overcast or raining) help add to the feeling of alienation. (no pun intended) The acting is great all around. Donald Sutherland plays a great straight man. His lack of emotion and sense of control makes the story more believable the more you see how this rational man is confronted with the end of the human race. Brook Adams, Jeff Goldblum, Veronica Cartwright and Leonard Nimoy round out the great ensemble cast. Look for cameos from Robert Duval and Kevin McCarthy (from the original) Another creepy thing about this movie are the sounds. If you really listen to the soundtrack while watching it's as eerie as the images. Heartbeats sounds that are speeded up and slowed, distortion, a busy signal and lets not forget the music. Some new age electronic stuff that sent chills down my spine. Definitely recommended to fans of all sci-fi thriller movies. And just about anyone who loves a good scary flick. No slashings or killers with a knife behind the doors. Just a good old fashioned well told story.But beware you might have a little trouble sleeping after watching. BE CAREFUL OF STRANGE PLANTS!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Invasion of the Body Snatchers," director Philip Kaufman's superior 1978 remake of Don Siegel's 1956 original (itself an adaptation of the novel "The Invasion of the Body Snatchers" by Jack Finney) is the scariest sci-fi thriller I've ever seen. Nothing matches the level of fear and paranoia in this movie, except of course for the original novel that it's based on. Just as Finney's novel and its accompanying cinematic adaptation by Siegel were frightening satires of McCarthyism, Kaufman's remake can be seen as a chilling satire of mindless consumerism - human beings devoid of emotion and personality mindlessly going about daily routines for no apparent reason. That it's set against the backdrop of San Francisco, a city known for celebrating its unique sense of individuality - Siegel's original and Finney's novel were both set in fictional small California towns - deepens the irony. Dr. Matthew Bennell (Donald Sutherland) and his assistant Elizabeth Driscoll (Brooke Adams, who can do the most amazingly weird, and sexy, little thing with her eyes) are two San Francisco health inspectors who make a horrifying discovery: alien pods are taking over their friends and neighbors as they sleep, and replacing them with emotionless duplicates. Together with hippie-liberal mud-bath owners Jack Bellicec (Jeff Goldblum) and his wife Nancy (Veronica Cartwright), and pop psychiatrist David Kibner (Leonard Nimoy), they go on the run throughout the city streets trying to find a way to stop the invasion. But as this film's ending proves, even that's not a sure thing, giving this film a strong anti-Hollywood vibe and showing us that not every alien invasion story has a happy ending. (In fact, "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" is famous for having one of the most shocking and terrifying endings ever filmed.) Philip Kaufman wasn't playing around with this movie. I don't know what possessed him to do what he did with this movie, but everything, from the performances (Sutherland and Goldblum, in particular, are real stand-outs), the action, to the camera shots, and every word of dialogue (excellently scripted by W.D. Richter) seems to count for something; there is not a single wasted moment at all in this terrifying sci-fi fright flick. "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" is one of the great sci-fi fright flicks out there; for the record, it's the scariest one I've ever seen. It remains the best adaptation of Finney's original novel, and two remakes followed afterward, "Body Snatchers" in 1993 and "The Invasion" in 2007.10/10</fullReview>

It seems they cannot trust no one, including those are being acting strange and emotionless.Directed by Philip Kaufman (Henry &amp; June, Rising Sun, Twisted) made an unique, paranoid, suspense, sci-fi/horror film of the late 1970's. This is a semi-sequel of the original 1956 movie of the same name. It also includes an couple of in-jokes for fans of the 1956 picture as well. This intriguing story, which is based on a novel by Jack Finney. Which it's been certainly an classic premise. Which it's been remade twice again in 1993 as "Body Snatchers" and 2007 as "The Invasion". Sutherland gives an strong performance in this film. But he's surrounded by a good cast like Adams, Goldblum, Cartwright and Nimoy. Which these supporting cast are giving an fine performances as well.The latest DVD from MGM/FOX is a two disc set. DVD has an fine anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good:Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound. DVD also has an interesting commentary track by the director (Which it's been from the previous DVD edition and it's wasn't anamorphic as well). Disc two has an entertaining featurettes but they are disappointingly short. Which all these features from disc two are under one hour! The featurettes from disc two has interviews with the filmmakers, sound designers and actors. The features are good but they could have been much longer and i would love to production stories by Adams, Goldblum and Nimoy but they are not interview sadly. The two disc set also has an fascinating collector's booklet. This horrific paranoia thriller certainly has a lot of attention and it has one of the most bleakest eerie conclusions in movie history. Don't miss this unusual movie. Screenplay by W.D. Richter (Big Trouble in Little China, Needful Things, Stealth). Weird music score by Denny Zeitlin. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Sci-Fi film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is absolutely fantastic and still doesn't look out of place now amongst the big sci - fi adventures such as independence day and that stupid film with john travolta (i made no effort into finding out what the film was called!). With a mixture of good acting, very dark suspence and a plot that has you on the edge of your seat, you know you've got a great film in your hands. This is far superior to the 1958 version and still overshadows the questionable 3rd remake in 1992 with forest whitaker. I was so impressed with this film that i bought the DVD and can now watch it whenever i want to amuse myself. Its true cinema brought to the TV screen.9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie for the first time when I was 13 years old, watching it in three parts, after school, and even if it was daytime, it scared me to death. Some images of it are still haunting me, such as the ending, well... just the way an ending should be, just plain maddening.The plot features a brand new idea, alien plants, and has a dark, moody and paranoid atmosphere. There is no gore, just unrelenting suspense. You never quite know who's possessed by the alien form, you suspect everyone and it's almost unbearable. Nancy Cartwright delivers a great performance -- she looks soooo scared! -- and the ensemble cast is convincing. The same subject has been filmed in 1956, under the same title (it's OK, but the remake is better) and in 1994 under the title Body Snatchers ( almost every good idea is wasted in this one, tough it's entertaining if you haven 't seen the others).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is just as good as the first one, with some current characteristics thrown in. Both Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams were fabulous.It still had the same subtlety as the the 1956 version, but other horrifying scenes had been added, at least for the 1978 audience, to maybe answer some questions about the whole phenomenon. This thing crawls into your psyche and, again, as I've said before, makes you think about it for a long time. Blatant horrificness (is that a word?"} ran rampant through the last one, which even sets it apart from its ancestor. There really was a perfect balance between the sublety and blatant "horrificness." The one nudity part seemed to be necessary, if nothing else for a sort of realism.San Francisco was a good normal backdrop that almost everybody could identify with, instead of a fictional town. Tat makes it even scarier. The ending differs from the first one, but it does nothing to detract from the story as it exists, 22 years later...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Improvement on the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1956 B-movie classic is given the big-budget Hollywood treatment--which means more money and bigger names--and would you know it, they actually managed to improve on the original.Communist infiltration and Cold War paranoia is SO 1950s, so this time around the story about pods from outer space replacing earthlings with mindless automatons is set in the urban atmosphere of San Francisco and feeds off of the conspiracy theorist paranoia of a post-Watergate America. Director Philip Kaufman owes Roman Polanski a beer for borrowing the "everyone is watching" jittery camera work and wacky jazz music Polanski used to make "Rosemary's Baby" so nerve wracking, and I'm guessing the scene of Donald Sutherland panicking in a phone booth while suspicious strangers lurk outside is a direct homage.Sutherland, with his afro and bug eyes, seems only one step removed from a space alien to begin with. Jeff Goldblum is present as well, and he becomes more normal after being cloned. One has to conclude, therefore, that the movie doesn't make much of a case for the human race being much worse off after an alien invasion. But it's a lot of fun, and does succeed in creating some creepy scenes, unlike the first one.And because this is the 70s and not the 50s, we get some extra bang for our buck: like some gratuitous boob shots (which come to think of it actually makes sense though, since it's not logical that replacement humans would be spit out of a giant seed pod fully clothed) and a bizarre scene featuring a dog with a man's head that licks his lips suggestively at our heroine. O.k. so that one's not really explained, but what finally IS explained in this version is what happens to the original human bodies once there's a cloned version of them walking around; they deflate like a punctured air mattress.Not really that scary, but a fun movie nonetheless.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somewhat overlong but chilling remake of the 50s classic about pod people trying to take over the world, with a much more downbeat ending. Also these pod people are more stoic, anti-social and maybe even more violent than the ones in the original film, including the tendency to scream rather loudly. There are still the undertones of the dehumanization of humanity and the loss of identity and fear of ceasing to be "us" and becoming "them" and when "us" is the minority and "them" is the majority. Kevin McCarthy, the hero of the original film, has a cameo as a man running in the streets. Also Don Siegel, the director of the original film, has a cameo as a cab driver.Veronica Cartwright seemed to have a knack for appearing in doomed roles.Leonard Nimoy gets to play a rare villain, Jeff Goldblum has an early role and Donald Sutherland has an afro!The sight of Brooke Adams naked is also a welcome sight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 70's sci-fi classic that feels a bit outdated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Well why not a space flower? Why do we always expect metal ships?"Since its publication in 1955, Jack Finney's Sci-Fi novel has been adapted many times for the big screen. The first adaptation was directed an year later by Don Siegel starring Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter. The story took place entirely in a small Alabama town where some of the locals began mysteriously behaving in strange and detached manners, but more than twenty years later Philip Kaufman decided to remake this film and relocate the story in the populated city of San Francisco instead. The circumstances were different and the underlying political themes weren't necessary so this film focused entirely on the growing sense of paranoia behind the invasion. The mystery element is gone here, because from the very first scene we witness how this strange organic life form, similar to gel spores, begins drifting from a far away planet through space until it reaches our atmosphere and is washed down by rain in San Francisco. Here the spores develop into plants with pink flowers and the people who come into contact with them begin behaving in strange ways, which is of course a result of this life form taking over the bodies. The first to notice the change is Elizabeth Driscoll (Brooke Adams) who shares her concern with co-worker, Matthew Bennell (Donald Sutherland), a public health inspector. She tells him that her husband has begun to act in a very mysterious manner and that he seems detached from any emotion. Matthew recommends she talk with his friend, David Kibner (Leonard Nimoy), a renown psychiatrist. When Elizabeth goes to speak with him, David mentions that other people have come up to him with similar concerns. Their fears are confirmed when Matthew's friends, Jack (Jeff Goldblum) and Nancy (Veronica Cartwright) discover a strange corpse that is being formed by the plant to duplicate one of them. By this time the invasion is in full force in the city and they must find a way to escape before it's too late. The original film was already considered to be quite good, but this remake is probably the most referred to when mentioning Finney's novel. All the other adaptations after this one haven't met the same reception. The way in which cinematographer, Michael Chapman, shot the film gave it a much more disturbing atmosphere with the skewed angles, deep compositions, and dark shadows which only adds to the bizarre qualities of the film. It is an eerie sci-fi movie with some memorable sequences (who can forget the moment that mutant dog with a human face suddenly shows up on screen?) and you never know what direction the story is going to go. Unfortunately the film is a bit outdated and the effects don't look as great. The performances are solid, but sometimes they were over sold. Invasion of the Body Snatchers wasn't as fun as I had anticipated it to be, and the pacing began to drag at times. I probably would've enjoyed this film more if I had seen it several years ago, but by now the plot is overly familiar so the suspense and the scares don't work as well. Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams play the two lead characters and they manage to engage the audience and allow us to sympathize with their cause. Adams is especially cute here and she can move her eyes like no one else. Nimoy gets a very conventional role and his character doesn't do much for the film. We've seen Goldblum play very similar roles as well and he did manage to get on my nerves during some of his freak out scenes. The cast delivers, but they were all far from being memorable. I can imagine the story freaked audiences out during the 70's and 80's, but for today's standards it isn't as effective. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satirical Update of a Sci Fi Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're going to do an update of one of the greatest sci fi films of all time, just go all out and put your own spin on it! That's what happens with the late 70s update of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." The fear of communism and McCarthyism is updated and replaced with encounter groups and the whole "me decade" thing. It doesn't work as well as the original - I think the small town setting serves the story better than San Francisco. And Donald Sutherland and Jeff Goldblum aren't really topping the list of actors who typify human emotions. But Veronica Cartwright is wonderful in her role and there are some extremely chilling visuals -- including that damn dog with a man's head. I also loved the downbeat ending. This is a fine and fun remake that won't match the original but truly deserves to be seen along side it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A somewhat flawed remake of the 1956 original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1978 version is not quite up to the original 1956 one, but nevertheless warrants a viewing anyway. The director, regrettably, succumbs to a little cheap and gruesome horror tactics to achieve nasty and unnecessary visceral shock value in the genre of teenage slasher flicks a la 'Scream' et al, as opposed to progressively building up to the climax slowly and inexorably to its ultimate conclusion.(The best form of terror is always implied and creeping). The movie somehow can't sustain the momentum necessary to bring the viewer to the edge of his/her seat because there are too many mini climaxes which intercede before the finale, that unfortunately vitiates rather than heightens the full impact of the final climax/scene; however, it is still reasonably shocking and chilling and reminiscent of the final scene in the 1973 movie, The Wicker Man. These moments are still memorable and indelibly ingrained forever in the viewer's mind's-eye to the extent they define the respective movies' signature.Oh, and another thing what makes the movie truly unforgettable is the actress Brooke Adams who plays Elizabeth: she is simply gorgeous --with a face you love to love.</fullReview>

They meet in a lecture and he tries to convince her that she has some emotional problem with Geoffrey, while Elizabeth notes that other people are having the same complaint.When Matthew's friends, Nancy and Jack Bellicec, find a clone of Jack in their medical mud business, they call Matthew and he immediately seeks out Elizabeth.He breaks in her house and finds a clone of her.The quartet discovers that people are being replaced by exact emotionless replicas using plants that get them when they sleep...The thing that you realise whilst you are watching this the most, is just how much is going on in the background, and how many normal people of the public (not extras) are included in this brilliant movie. making it feel a little more real than most horror films.The sense of urgency throughout the film is very apparent, the soundtrack slowly playing the same sound over and over in more tense parts of the film.For the time that the film was made, the effects are pretty groundbreaking, and are on par with The Thing for effect.The cast are great, especially Sutherland and Nimoy, and while Goldblum is impressive, he becomes very annoying at times, especially when people are trying to have phone conversations.Camera-work is the films Strong point, and lighting plays a very important part to the narrative, giving the film a fresh feel.all in all it's a good movie, and one of the best remakes ever, and don't forget the ending, it's so anti Hollywood, it's brilliant, and makes the film the classic it is today.</fullReview>

My dad rented it, saying that it was "a classic" and that I had to watch it. I was sure I would be disappointed-that I would get bored and that the special effects would be pathetic. I was wrong. WAY wrong. The plot starts out slowly-we see vague messages and signs. Then it deepens, once we start realizing what is happening, you can't wait to see what happens next! It's just great entertainment. I especially liked the acting from Jeff Goldblum, it was very realistic.A wonderful script, superb acting, and the second-best movie ending of all time(Watch "The Sting").

		<fullReview>The start of this 1970s horror film is a taut, minimalist movie that like all the best of its genre, trades off an atmosphere of fear without actually showing the audience anything. And when we do eventually get to see something, it is then truly horrible. Sadly, once we know the nature of the terror, the film loses its way somewhat, and drifts into unfocused action scenes. The film still stands out for its interesting cast including Donald Sutherland, Jeff Goldblum and Leonard Nimoy (who plays, to all intents and purposes, Mr. Spock without the ears); and for all its limitations, it still has some merit compared with modern equivalents that hide their lameness behind a gallery of superfluous special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the original, but closer than most</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror movies tend to be the source of the most remakes, as is the case right now, with plans in the works in Hollywood for what must be every low-budget horror film to be "re-imagined." There are good reasons for this; the basic aim of horror is to create visceral reactions in the audience, so premises are usually simple and dramatic. Big stars rarely appear in horror movies, since it's really the content that's the star, and as what content is considered acceptable in movies changes opportunities for updates come up. Philip Kauffmann's Invasion of the Body Snatchers is one of the better remakes that I've seen. Actually, it could be taken as a sequel as much as a remake to the earlier movie, showing the invasion at a later stage. Here, instead of a small town the setting is San Francisco, though the story's structure is fairly close to the original. It's not surprising that this already grim scenario, a product of 1950s paranoia, would become even bleaker in the 70s. The original showed the aliens taking over a small town; here they take over an entire city. The cast is the first of the movie's pluses. It includes Donald Sutherland, as a food inspector, Brooke Adams, who also appeared in Days of Heaven but is given an actual role here, Veronica Cartwright, the other woman aboard the Nostromo, and Jeff Goldblum, playing his usual neurotic. The movie's major strength, though, is its atmosphere. Kaufmann's inventive direction builds a sense of paranoia and unease in each scene through off-kilter camera angles and ominous details. Since a remake by its nature is going to lack the original's element of surprise, Kauffman compensates in the first half by keeping the audience constantly on its toes with the feeling that something may be about to happen. The movie falters a bit when it comes to storytelling. The premise, at least as developed here, is a little too thin for the full running time, and once the characters have recognized the threat, the rest of the movie consists of them running away. In comparison to the lean Don Siegel original, this goes on for too long, particularly when it becomes clear that none of these people are going to get away. It's not too surprising that this already grim scenario, a product of 1950s paranoia, would become even bleaker in the 70s. The original showed the aliens taking over a small town; here they take over an entire city.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Invasion of the Body Snatchers begins on a distant planet far far away from Earth. Some strange looking white jelly substance, a bit like Frog spawn, rises from the planets surface &amp; floats into the darkness of space. San Francisco, California &amp; it's a normal busy working day for the inhabitants of the city. A laboratory assistant who works for the Department of Public Health named Elizabeth Driscoll (Brooke Adams) is on her way home when she notices a strange looking unusual flower &amp; pod on a bush, she picks it &amp; takes it home. Elizabeth discusses the flower with her boyfriend Dr. Geoffery Howell (Art Hindle) &amp; speculates that the flower may be a totally new species created when two different plants cross pollinate to create a unique third individual. Elizabeth &amp; Geoffery settle down for the night &amp; go to sleep. The next morning &amp; Geoffery seems different to Elizabeth somehow, he won't answer her &amp; appears emotionless (he ain't a politician is he?). Elizabeth voices her concerns to her friend &amp; boss, field investigator Matthew Bennell (Donald Sutherland) &amp; he suggests she visit a psychologist he knows named Dr. David Kibner (Leonard Nimoy). Strange things begin to happen throughout San Francisco as more people claim to have suspicions about loved ones not being themselves &amp; without feelings. Jack (Jeff Goldblum) &amp; Nancy Bellicec (Veronica Cartwright) phone Matthew when Nancy discovers a hideous mutated human thing covered in slime, white stringy hair &amp; tendrils that was trying to clone her husband Jack while he was asleep. Matthew starts to believe Elizabeth's crazy theories as he sees the proof in front of him, it soon becomes clear that the cloning is widespread through the city &amp; they simply don't know who to trust in their bid to stop the alien invasion that intends to wipe out the entire human race &amp; replace them with emotionless clones! (I knew there was a reason why my workmates acted like they do!)Directed by Philip Kaufman I thought Invasion of the Body Snatchers was a highly entertaining horror film that's well worth watching. This version made in 1978 was the second of three Body Snatcher films, the first being Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) &amp; the third was Body Snatchers (1993), I would say this '78 version is probably the best one. The script by W.D. Ritcher based on the novel The Body Snatchers by Jack Finney is slow to start but superbly manages to build momentum &amp; tension as the film progresses. The invasion is told from a very small perspective, basically just Elizabeth &amp; Matthew are the only characters who are constant throughout, we see the invasion happen &amp; progress through their eyes. As a whole the approach works very well rather than having say the entire army &amp; loads of survivors battling the invasion. As Invasion of the Body Snatchers reaches it's conclusion I was starting to become paranoid about the characters who I as a viewer could trust &amp; might turn out to be pod people! I liked the downbeat ending which probably didn't sit too well with most audiences, there's no happy outcome here! The thought of an emotionless society without love, hate or any kind of feeling is indeed a scary one. The slightly slow pace &amp; near two hour running time may put some off as it's not exactly action packed but anyone who puts the effort in to sit down &amp; watch it should be rewarded with an interesting &amp; thought provoking horror film, it's not too often I can write that in a review! One thing I will mention that didn't work for me is the fact these aliens never attempted to kill either of the troublesome Elizabeth or Matthew when that would have solved the situation very easily for them, still that's a very small point overall. Everyone involved put in good performances, Brooke Adams makes for an attractive leading lady (&amp; yes, she does get naked at the end!) &amp; Donald Sutherland makes for a likable hero. Jeff Goldblum &amp; Leonard Nimoy are both great in their roles &amp; good fun to watch. What little there is in the way of special effects are well done, the space shots at the beginning look good &amp; the slimy pod transformation scenes are suitably gooey, messy &amp; feature lots of loud crunching on the soundtrack! The only sequence containing any gore is when Matthew repeatedly hits a pod creature in the face which splits open &amp; implodes. There is also a freaky dog with a human face after a transformation obviously went wrong. Generally speaking Invasion of the Body Snatchers is well made throughout with good production values that while aren't outstanding are more than acceptable. Overall I really liked this film &amp; recommend it to anyone who wants to see something creepy, plays on a basic fear of who we can &amp; can't trust &amp; as a result probably touches a nerve with most of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another 70s Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of the best movies of all time were out in the 70s and 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)' is no exception.There are no ways to describe this masterpiece. The pacing, the story, the acting, the music score, the direction, are all perfect.Comparing it with the 1956 original - the unfortunate producer's cut (the intro and outro were added later and destroyed half of the film's impact) - this one's clearly better.I would like to emphasize Leonard Nimoy's appearance as the psychiatrist. In this role it is being proven what a talented actor Nimoy is and that he is worth a lot more recognition as an artist. His performance makes the movie more credible, as he gives a pragmatic dimension to the movie.Recommended viewing conditions: Alone, very late at night.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie "Snatches" your attention!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the alien-type invasion movies out there, this movie is by far the best ever made! This is one of those movies that make you think about for days after watching it the first time! Though confusing at times, the drama and horror of the movie, especially the ending, makes this an A.1. thriller! This was the first movie I saw where the "Bad Guys" come out ahead in the end, unlike all the typical endings where the good guys win. That's the main difference between this and the original 50's version. You can watch this movie and think to yourself "This could really happen". I would have to say this version is slightly better than the 50's one. The 1994 version showed no love to the story - it was horrible! All in all, you must unplug the phone, turn off the lights and watch this bad boy - you'll love it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only thing I'm sure of, having seen this film, is that it is one of the few seventies films I found you could sit through without really having to try. OK this ain't a masterpiece, but tell me, which film is?? This film is carried by it's actors by the story and in some way by the fear you feel. You really are wondering, who has been ?snatched' and who has not. OK this is neither an big explosion nor an extremely thrilling vehicle, but it keeps your attention. The best things in this film I think is the scene when Donald Sutherland falls asleep in the Yard and the end. The end really made me like this film and it was easy for me after it to give this film a 7, but I won't because as I said the rest of the film was not as convincingly good and it was not good all the time. But in the end I was extremely terrified. So this all summons up to a6,5 out of 10 (something is missing in this film)!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The remake is never as good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My comments are directed to a comparison of this film and its original 1956 version, directed by Don Siegel. I've seen both versions twice, most recently on television, back to back. On second viewing, I liked the original more than I did the first time, and the remake less. I now think that the original is a near masterpiece, while the remake is much inferior. [new para.]One reason is that the remake is a full 35 minutes longer than the original, which was only 80 minutes long. Of course, this is very typical of how movies have changed in those two decades: an audience today would feel cheated if they spent $14.00 for a movie less than an hour and a half long. The fact is, however, that for the telling of a single narrative about 90 minutes is plenty and nearly two hours is too long. [new para.]The premise of both films is really quite simple: aliens invade earth in the form of spores, they grow in pods, they take over the bodies of humans and replace them, and their plan (presumably) is to take over the whole human race. The plot centres on the discovery of the conspiracy, and on whether or not the heroes can escape. [new para.]Another reason is that the remake is full of special effects not present in the original, which has very few - and those few are not especially good. However, and this is another of my prejudices, there is almost an inverse relationship between F/X and dramatic impact. We know the body snatchers are hatching in pods. How they actually do it really doesn't matter. What is scary is that humans are becoming non-humans: they are losing their vital spirit, their emotions. The shots of half-formed pod-people is just yucky stuff; it's not truly frightening. [new para.]A third reason is that the musical score in the original is much superior. This is surprising: music in the 1950s usually was overdone. Here it's the more modern score that is overblown and calls attention to itself. Indeed, the sound effects and camera tricks indulged in by Philip Kaufman - although some are effective - are mostly distracting. Technically, I think Siegel is the better director, even though his style is much more traditional. Compare the chase scenes: Siegel's are better. [new para.]Lastly - and this is the most important reason - the original has a resonance that simply cannot be attained in the remake because of the time in which each was made. It is crystal clear, regardless of the intention of the author of the novel, that the theme of the original is related to Americans' fear of Communism. That invests the plot with a terror that is much more convincing than the superficial one of aliens from outer space, which is all the remake has. There are clever cultural references in the remake to bring it up to date - particular having to do with pop psychology, but also with health and environmental concerns, and some crackpot scientific theories - but none carry any great weight that take the remake outside the genre. The ending, though creepy, thus cannot compare to the horrifying scene of Kevin McCarthy screaming "you're next" to disbelieving drivers on the highway, unaware that their freedom is about to be stolen.</fullReview>

The actors aren't very good, unlike the first film, and their voices are unemotional though they try. The oppressive atmosphere that made the first movie so successful is gone. Brooke Adams is way too pretty. There's also the heavy handed or bad writing that gives away plot developments from miles away, making this just another horrible horror movie. There are red herrings about the nature of this alien thing that are probably the result of shoddy writing/editing work. I can go on and on, but I shall stop now. Rent another movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High quality suspense from start to finish!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For once, you can put all the skepticism and prejudices you have on remakes aside? Philip Kaufman's update of Don Siegel's classic piece of science fiction is all but redundant! A truly scary picture about alienation and mass hysteria that literally leaves you speechless. Kaufman relocates the small-town nightmare of the original to big and anonymous city of San Francisco, which has a slightly less claustrophobic effect. The inescapable `fear' of the '56 version weakens because of this, but cast and crew still manage to create an extremely tense atmosphere and a blood-rushing tempo. Of course, the terrific cast also contributes to the high quality status of this film. The charismatic Donald Sutherland and the stunningly beautiful Brooke Adams make a great film couple and they receive excellent feedback from top-actors and actresses like Jeff Goldblum, Veronica Cartwright and Leonard `Spock' Nimoy! Matthew (Sutherland) and Elizabeth (Adams) are good friends and colleagues at the Health Department. One day, Elizabeth takes home an unknown species of flowers and their lives start to change dramatically. It seems like all kind of inhabitants of San Francisco are going through a bizarre metamorphosis all of a sudden. Their bodies still walk and talk, but all emotions and feelings seem vanished. Elizabeth slowly succeeds in convincing her friends something strange is happening! And how? people seem to turn into pod-people while they're asleep! An exact duplicate is growing while you're asleep, waiting to take in your displace you!The basic plot (based on Jack Finney's novel) is ultra fascinating and very believable, even though it contains far fetched extraterrestrial aspects. Fact is, if you're completely living yourself in to this film?there's a good change you'll be terrified. Kaufman brilliantly causes fear with simple methods. There isn't much musical guidance in Invasion of the Body Snatchers, but there's excellent usage of natural noises like heartbeats, hearth fire or just?silence. Also, long shots and pans of one interior, which really increases the tension second by second. The majority of `scares' in Invasion is caused by the compelling and suspenseful storyline, yet some sequences are purely horrific with awesome use of special and make-up effects. Never gross or anything, but definitely uncomfortable to look at. The high-rate quality of this film keeps on rushing buy and there isn't a dip or unnecessary moment to detect! Even the few sentimental sequences don't seem forced! Kaufman's film is a perfect and memorable wholesome, which includes all the necessary elements to form a classic in its genre. If you're looking for an adrenalin-filled film experience, you found it here. Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a great remake! Director of the original ? Don Siegel ? obviously thoughts so too, otherwise he wouldn't have agreed on playing a small role in it, don't you think? Keep your eyes open for him, as he shortly appears as the vicious cabdriver. Decent horror remakes are rare, but this one is the perfect proof to state it's possible. Along with John Carpenter `The Thing' and David Cronenberg's `The Fly'; it's one of the few films that actually pay tribute to the original, instead of ruining it. The classic novel received another update in 1993, directed by Abel Ferrera this time. Even though he clearly is an over-talented filmmaker (Driller Killer, The Addiction), his version of the story lacks the tension and audience involvement of its predecessors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the original version a few nights ago and last night I saw 1978 remake of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS . I thought the remake had the edge over the original . What made it better was the dark , bleak oppressive atmosphere of utter paranioa helped a lot by the synthesiser heartbeat on the soundtrack and the nightfilming . The remake also contains one of the most disturbing images I`ve ever seen with that " Dog " . If you`ve seen the movie you`ll remember that bit no matter how hard you`ll want to forget it and ( !!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILER TO ENDING !!! ) the remake has a memorable downbeat ending very different from the original ( !!!! END SPOILER !!!!!)I saw the original last week , watched QUATERMASS 2 yesterday morning and saw the INVASION OF THE BODYSNATCHERS remake last night. I`ve also seen the rather weak 1993 BODYSNATCHERS and the poor PUPPETMASTERS so I think I`m qualified to say this is the best film version dealing with the theme of humans getting taken over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matthew Bennell (Donald Sutherland) is a health inspector in San Francisco. Elizabeth Driscoll (Brooke Adams) is a lab tech in the health department but she finds her husband has changed. Nobody believes her. Dr. David Kibner (Leonard Nimoy) tries to explain it all away with some psychobabble. That is until friends Jack Bellicec (Jeff Goldblum) and Nancy Bellicec (Veronica Cartwright) sees something shocking.This has some slow spots. But when Kevin McCarthy comes banging on the windshield, this movie really starts. That is great moment that references one of the most iconic scenes in movie history. I couldn't ask for a more beautiful scene from this movie. It still has its problems. Nimoy's character was revealed too early. The pacing do drag too much. Sutherland's character is too willfully blind for too long. Basically the audience knows too much and too far ahead of the characters. It's a balancing act that they fail to maintain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that it has taken me years to see this movie. As a child, I had a fear of being possessed whether by alien pods or demons. I avoided this movie. Today, I finally saw it and it is really a good movie for horror and science fiction. Brook Adams better known as Tony Shaloub's wife is terrific in her role and reminds me of Linda Fiorentino in some respects. Donald Sutherland plays Matthew Bennell. Brook's Elizabeth confides that her husband Jeffrey is acting strange. So other spouses are discovering their partners have changed overnight. The film is set and filmed in San Francisco. The supporting cast members include the under-rated Veronica Cartwright and Jeff Goldblum and also Leonard Nimony as well as Art Hindle as Jeffrey. The film is faithful to the original movie but there are minor changes and this version allows us to see how the transformation happens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a solid remake, about on par with the original, as it does some things better but other things worse. The story really isn't changed at all, just updated to the '70s in San Francisco, and that kind of hurts it, because anyone who's seen the original knows exactly what's going to happen. That is, up until the twist, which is really terrific and suits the film perfectly; it's quite dark, something that the original sorely needed (and almost had, if the director had had his way). The direction is quite good with some impressive cinematography, and there are some truly scary moments, but the acting is okay at best and the characters aren't developed at all. It does a nice job of updating the paranoia of the first one, but doesn't do enough to distance itself from the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1978 remake of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" is in many ways the equal to the original movie. Running a little under 2 hours, the story keeps your interest and has a few really creepy and scary scenes. As some other reviewers have pointed out, the music and cinematography were quite atmospheric.********************** WARNING SPOILERS ******************************There are a few scenes that are quite startling including a replication gone bad between a dog and man and the disintegration of one of the characters as replication has completed. Once scene where Donald Sutherland's character is joyed to hear a ship in the harbor and believes it will offer him escape from the evil pod people. In the next scene we see his spirit crushed and hear him mutter "Oh God" as large pallets of pods are lowered into the hold of the ship. The ending provides a nasty shock as well and it is clear the future of humanity bodes ill.********************* END SPOILERS **********************************This film got some exposure in the early 1980's, but has since dropped off the radar screen. I remembered seeing it in the early 1980's and recently purchased it on DVD. It has a good cast of characters including Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, Jeff Goldbulm, in one of hist first big roles, Veronica Cartwright and Leonary Nimoy in a role as one of the pod people nasties.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the fifties we were all slightly paranoid. I can remember a period when I was watching the skies, expecting them to come. So The Body Snatchers, The Thing, and other fifties sci fi films used to scare me rotten. I remembered having seen this seventies version many years ago, and the fact that I couldn't remember much about it, made me think it can't have been very good. However I have just watched it again, and have to admit it was a well made sequel. I call it a sequel because It didn't seem to be a remake, but a continuation of the fifties cult film. Even though the plot was the same, there was enough going on to keep me entertained. Another good performance by Sutherland, and all the extras were quite good. The big difference in the two, was that I wasn't afraid to go to sleep after watching this one. Perhaps it's just a sign of the times. Maybe we are not so paranoid nowadays. Jeff Goldblum didn't look so Tall in this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective Remake of '56 classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most remakes of great movies stink because they try to clone the original and then make it more hip. Philip Kaufman's "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", however, has a completely different take on the story first filmed by Donald Siegel. Though Siegel's masterpiece of science fiction is more taut and engrossing than its remake, Kaufman's adaptation is a good, very scary film in its own right. Siegel's version is an analogy to Nazism, Communism and general forces of de-humanization. Rather surprisingly, it is more swiftly-paced than its remake. The 1956 classic's terrifying power came from the images of normal-looking people in a nice town doing strange and insidious things. The camera is beautifully handled; the director presents these images without a lot of show, so that they can take their grip on the viewer. Kaufman's 1978 version is slower, more ponderous. The camera is constantly on the move-- zooming, jumpily cutting, hiding behind banisters, tilting, and going so far as to fly into a character's mouth. Kaufman's film is shot like a chiller, taking tremendous care to throw the audience into confusion. In a way, this lessens the overall effect by drawing attention away from the material. However, the material itself is enough to make you want to burn all your houseplants. It starts out terrifically in a very slow build-up, very different from, but quite as good as the 1956 version's plunge into the unknown. Unfortunately, when the action really gets under way, the film starts to drag. It's buffered with some rather unnecessary gore. Too many things happen before that neat, chilling ending. Still, the story translates wonderfully to themes more appropriate to 1978; rather than representing the brainwashing power of society, the pod people are treated like members of a huge and growing cult, an ordered revolt against the order of the human race. By not trying to outdo the near-perfection of Don Siegel's film but approaching the material differently, Kaufman has turned out a unique horror movie that will probably keep you up a good part of the night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the few scary films around that truly is scary. And with a minimum of blood and gore, no less. It takes its time by getting to know the characters and the fact that something is wrong, although you can't quite figure out what... All the leads in the film are good, and Philip Kaufman's directing make this film one of the masterpieces of science fiction horror. His use of odd camera lenses and warped mirrors to give the movie that fish-eyed sense of distortion; weird camera angles to make people think they're in one place, then turn the camera around to make you realize you're someplace else. The alien screams are what really raise the hairs on your neck, simply by how they're not like anything you've ever heard in your life. But at a basic level, the movie says something very frightening about conformity, which is the most terrifying thing of all. The aliens' persuasions: you won't feel a thing, you'll feel better afterwards, you'll never be afraid or hateful again; sound suspiciously like real people today persuading others to cut their hair, dress and behave properly, be polite... All in all, a great story about the horrible cost of what it takes to "blend in with the others."</fullReview>

It was interesting watching it with a dozen other college-age people because we were all pretty skeptical what appeal a (seemingly) corny 70's flick would have for us, but after watching the creepy build up and final, unforgettable scene there wasn't a single person there who didn't get the chills! It's hard to classify this one as it's a suspense/sci-fi/horror movie (in that order) but by the end of the movie you'll definitely feel an uneasy knot in your stomache greater than most horror movies could ever give. For those like me who were disappointed in the grossly overhyped THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, watch this instead for a great example of how genuine creepiness and horror can be conveyed without a lot of gore, although IOTBS has its fair share of special effects, all used very effectively.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Both are very well done. These are excellent science fiction thrillers with exceptional writing and acting. The color of the 1978 film vs. the black &amp; white of the 1956 film makes very little difference. To me, the cast of the newer version does make a difference. Five strong performances by Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, Leonard Nimoy, Jeff Goldblum, and Veronica Cartwright outweigh the excellent acting of Kevin McCarthy, Dana Wynter, and Larry Gates. I can recommend both films. The Miller-Movies formula awards this film a solid 9, and the 1956 film a high 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of films claim to be scary, but few often live up to their claim. Invasion of the Body Snatchers, is creepy, and the way it works, you will think that everyone around you is a pod person by the time the film is over. The story starts out slow, but that's only to give us time to get to know the main characters. Then, slowly, strange things start happening. People start acting weird, mysterious flowers are popping up all around San Francisco and there seems to be more trash pickups than usual. Halfway through the film, the chase is on, and it doesn't let up. The ending will blow you away, I can't describe it here because that's half the fun of this movie. So, go pop some corn, dim the lights, and whatever you do...don't fall asleep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ultimately pointless and disappointing, Phil Kaufmann's film is an update and homage to Don Seigel's low budget classic of justifiable paranoia that transposes the setting to San Francisco. An effective opening, a classic closer, and a terrific nod to The Mephisto Waltz justify this enjoyable though over extended remake. The original at only 80 minutes long was quietly menacing, had the feel of a waking nightmare and effectively used it's small town setting. The 1978 film features too many scenes of people being chased by shrieking crowds and an over reliance on special effects without any real payoff, and after the first hour, the story slows down, becomes repetitive and coasts to that aforementioned closer. Goldblum and Cartwright are standouts while the leads are merely adequate and Leonard Nimoy as the psychiatric voice of reason feels so expendable. The film is more diverting than the other 2 remakes which followed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Remake to the Classic Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) *** (out of 4)Remake of the 1956 classic has Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams trying to figure out why so many people seem to believe that their loved ones aren't who they're supposed to be. As in the original, people are being duplicated through pods from outer space and it's only a matter of time until it spreads through the world. It could strongly be argued by those against remakes that there wasn't a need for the original movie to be remade but I always enjoy seeing what twists and turns other artists do with certain material. Director Philip Kaufman does a pretty good job at telling the story even though those familiar with the original aren't going to see anything not coming their way. I think the strongest thing this film has going for it is that it uses the updated technology to build up some of the material. This is especially true with the special effects because we're given more graphic pods as well as more graphic deaths. There's a sequence where Sutherland destroys his double and it's shocking to see that this got through with a PG rating and it's even more shocking when you consider it's more graphic than some of the stuff we'd see in the next decade and that stuff was getting hit with X-ratings. The performances are all a major plus with Sutherland doing a great job in the lead and I thought he and Adams had some great chemistry to take us through the film. Jeff Goldblum, Leonard Nimoy and Veronica Cartwright are also good as is a fun cameo by a member of the original. The one thing really missing here is the paranoid and built up tension that the first film had. I think some of this is due to the extra thirty-minutes of running time, which is really used to explain a lot of the stuff that is going on. These scenes certainly don't hurt the movie but at the same time I think the tightness of the original helped build up the tension. Still, as far as remakes go, this here is a good one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely watchable, though there are plenty of better films from its era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After discovering a strange flower pod and taking it home, health department agent Elizabeth Driscoll (Brooke Adams) notices her partner Geoffrey (Art Hindle) acting strangely. She follows him, watching him meet up with similarly morbid characters exchanging packages. It is only her work partner Matthew Bennell (Donald Sutherland) who seems to take her seriously. He takes her to meet intellectual psychiatrist David Kibner (Leonard Nimoy), who thinks she has convinced herself of this due to a breakdown in communication between her and Geoffrey. Only when Matthew's friend Jack (Jeff Goldblum) discovers a re-animating body of himself at his work, does the truth hit Matthew, and the group, along with Jack's wife Nancy (Veronica Cartwright), flee to escape the alien onslaught.Anyone who has seen Don Siegel's 1956 original, which was based on Jack Finney's 1955 novel, will know that the plot serves as a metaphorical interpretation of the U.S.'s political attitudes to communism, which they felt was attacking their countries democratic idealism. Philip Kaufman's 1978 remake abandons this intriguing premise in favour of something more straight-laced and old-fashioned. Not that this is a bad thing, as although inferior to Siegel's version, Invasion... is still a highly entertaining horror, that takes its time in the early stages to establish a foundation of impending dread, and to develop the main characters. This was an aspect that was prevalent throughout 1970's horror movies, with respected directors taking on the genre, and bringing their own artistic aesthetics and embedding them on screen.It is after the first 50 minutes or so when the film seems to abandon this approach to pursue a more relentless, panicked tone, as the film descends into a chase movie. It was this aspect that brought the film down a peg or two for me, as it seemed to almost sell-out on its atmospheric openings, and resort to more action-orientated tactics, with repetitive scenes of fleeing and hiding. Interestingly though, the camera-work shifts from calm and slow-moving, to hand-held and loose just as things get frantic, a similar approach directors Nicolas Roeg and Roman Polanski would take in their masterpieces Don't Look Now (1973) and Chinatown (1974), respectively.But, like I said earlier, the film is undoubtedly entertaining, and has plenty of homages to the original (stars Robert Duvall and Kevin McCarthy put in cameo appearances - the latter shouting "they're here!" in the street as if wandered over from the climax of the original), and, differently from the novel, stays true to the original's depressing and unresolved ending, the final image now being somewhat iconic in the world of horror. There are plenty of better films from the era of a similar ilk, but Invasion... remains extremely watchable, and unashamedly B-movieish in its execution.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Invasion of the Body Snatcher (1978)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers starts off really slow and compared to the original is inferior. The last half saves it from being a total flop, but it still a very average attempt at retelling the story of the body snatchers. The plot is of course that people are being replaced by replicas grown in plant like pods. It is up to Donald Sutherland's character and three others to escape the pod people and to try to save the world from an emotionless existence.I'll start with what I didn't like. I didn't like the first hour or so of this remake. I felt it to be very dry, very dull and slow moving. Things that should have kept my attention never really did. Being a huge fan of the original, it was really disappointing to see a remake made in 1978 to be so average. It could have been much better. I thought the acting was average. This movie was filled with good actors that just seemed so off for their roles. I did however enjoy the cameo of Kevin McCarthy who was in the original. Very well done scene of him trying to warn people that the "pod people" were coming.What really got my attention was when Matthew (Sutherland) and his friends were asleep and they were almost duplicated right in front of our eyes. That was such a dramatic and jaw dropping scene. The special effects were actually well done for that scene as well. After that scene, the movie picked up at a great pace, the chase was on. I loved the try to survive aspect of this and the original movie. You literally cannot trust anyone in the city. And if the pod people see you, they let out this piercing scream to let the others know where you are. I liked that addition to the movie.There was of course the famous "twist" or shock ending as well which I liked. Overall a decent remake to a true classic. I still love the original over this one by far. The 1956 version did a great job at character build up. We saw the change in the townsfolk more, and it helped make the first half of that movie interesting to watch. Invasion 1978 failed to get my interest for a large part of the first half, but did save itself by having a very strong finish.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another scary movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes are inevitably compared with the original. Is that a condemnation for the practice of making remakes? Not necessarily, although I don't think any producer would dare try to remake Citizen Kane, Casablanca or The Third Man (I'm ignoring those atrocious TV productions of the second and third; they just don't count).This film, of course, is a remake of a great black and white sci-fi classic, that had Kevin McCarthy (in his heyday) and Don Siegel (of Dirty Harry fame) as the director. I liked that original, but I didn't particularly like this one when I finally got to see it this year (2006).Donald Sutherland is always good, of course, and he does acquit himself well as one of San Francisco's health inspectors; Brooke Adams has never impressed me with her acting skills, but in this she turns in a surprisingly good performance; Jeff Goldblum again brings arrogance (he does it so well) to the role of a psychiatrist; and Veronica Cartwright is one of the few female actors who can perform 'the terrified female' without bathos or camp (who can forget her performance in Alien?). Leonard Nimoy, I'm afraid, is always Spock for me, no matter what he does.So, why do I dislike this effort? To answer that, I must hark back to the original that, according to most sources, was a thinly disguised warning of what was viewed, by 1950s authorities, as the Communist menace. Perhaps it was, but it should also be recalled that, at that time, the UFO craze was well in place, project Blue Book was under way and Area 51 was just a vague rumor. So, was Don Siegel et al just cashing in on the then current crop of talking points? Who knows? But, after seeing that movie, I was certain that most would see it as just Another Scary Movie for the times (recall the 1951 version of The Thing From Another World).This 1978 remake, however, cannot fall back on any of that communist or UFO mumbo-jumbo as its underlying theme, or message, if you will. So, if there is a message in this one, what is it? The only thing that makes any sense as a message is: an indictment of All Pervasive Authority (aka Big Brother is watching you), which ironically begins with Sutherland as a health inspector who trolls through the city's restaurants, giving and receiving abuse. So, is this remake trying to take itself seriously? It would seem so, and it's probably that aspect that is jarring for me.That's not to say that the film is not done well: it is. I liked the cinematography, particularly the dark interiors and a nicely done sequence as Sutherland rescues Adams from the clutches of her boy friend. The special effects were great ? and gory. The original score is effective but often unrelenting in its discordant sounds; hence, it tended to intrude on the narrative (I turned the sound down often to soften it). And the cameos by Kevin McCarthy, Don Siegel and Robert Duvall were a nice touch. But, the story is pure sci-fi and should be viewed as such: just Another Scary Movie.Now, if you want a movie about Big Brother, go see 1984.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to become an insomniac</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that it would suck if you fell asleep only if Fred Krueger haunted you, now there is a whole new reason to drink plenty of coffee. INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS is a creepy film that should have spawned plenty of sequels, if not at least one more. I can tell you that this film is very well done but it is also frustrating. This is such a huge subject and the film does a superlative job in exploring much of that topic. It also seems to give us just enough to keep us interested. As I was watching the movie, I said to my fiancee that there is enough material in here to make another film, and that was before I knew how the film ended. And then when that last shot stares you in the face, and the credits role, I was creeped out, felt icky ( two incredibly juvenile terms but nonetheless appropriate in this instance ) and left completely unsatisfied. I can't believe that this film has been around for 22 years and no one has taken it on. And given the fact that Philip Kaufman is the director here, couldn't he had at least some opportunity for a sequel? After 1981 he must have been at one of the high points of his career as he penned the script for RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. Perhaps he could have taken the script to Steven or George and they could have helped develop it. All I know is that there are very few sequels that aren't just a rehash of the first film. But this one could have been a true sequel. The next one could have started off right from the very last shot of the first. Dammit! I want to know more. I want to know where they came from, how they clone you while you sleep, and how come when some people got cloned when there didn't seem to be any pods around. There are so many questions that have answers to them. There has to be an intelligent script out there that is just collecting dust somewhere. Okay, I feel better now that issue is off my chest. As for the film itself, it is not really scary. It is incredibly creepy and it is very well done. Where as most horror films of this era are incredibly parsimonious with their budget, you can see that there was a substantial amount of money put into this one. The special effects are wonderful and the tension that builds is excellent. I like the fact that this also doesn't take long to get into the crux of the story. In the first ten minutes you can feel a sense of paranoia. We feel just as Liz does. We know there is something wrong, but just not what it is. We know the flower has something to do with it, but not sure exactly what. The film takes great pains to unravel the mystery like an onion. It has many layers to it and each one is peeled back with painstaking precision. But again, this brings me back to my original point, I want to know more, aaaahhh!!!I am 28 years old and I have seen tons of films. That may not seem old to many people but for my age I have seen a great many horror films( mostly from the 70's and on) and films in general. I believe that horror today can not compete with horror of yesterday ( there are exceptions, of course ). It is films like this that prove that point. While not scary the way HALLOWEEN is, it is intense and creepy. You feel weird after watching this film. And believe it or not, it will stay with you for a while. I was not terrified to go to sleep but it did stay with me during my slumber and I had a nightmare. In it, Leatherface was chasing me, and if I fell asleep, not only could he get me, if I alluded him then the Body Snatcher people would get me. Now that is a cool nightmare. I tossed and turned a few times and woke up in a cold sweat. But here is the capper. I wanted to go back to sleep so I could get back into that dream. How many movies from today can you think of that can do that to you? BLAIR WITCH, maybe SIXTH SENSE? Not many that's is for certain.8 out of 10 A great flick, but where is my sequel? Dammit!One of the coolest last shots of a film. Who thought Donald Sutherland could be so creepy?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In San Francisco, a group of people discover the human race is being replaced one by one, with clones devoid of emotion.Unfortunately, I am going to be a bit harsh on this film, and not just because it is a remake of a classic. The cast is excellent -- I absolutely love Donald Sutherland, Jeff Goldblum and Brooke Adams. Leonard Nimoy was alright, though i cannot say I am big fan of his. The cameos from Kevin McCarthy and Don Siegel are priceless.The effects are also quite good and far surpass the original. The plant-like body doubles? Excellent. I am not sure who did the effects, and I am not going to look at the moment, but they deserve the chief credit for this film. Above all, they are the ones who shine here.Despite this, and a fairly strong first half, the film just dies in the second half and left me rather bored. Once the complete takeover is imminent, the movie is done but keeps going for some reason. How many times can we see Sutherland run, almost get caught, escape, run, almost get caught... Once or twice maybe, but it keeps happening. And why? Just wrap it up -- we know he is doomed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not the original movie, but probably the best. Director Philip Kaufman's 1978 INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS remakes Don Siegel's 1956 movie of the same name, from the 1955 book by Jack Finney. And it is terrifying: Jeff Goldblum's scarecrow-skinny xylophone ribcage, Donald Sutherland's style-less white-fro, Veronica Cartwright's pre-ALIEN whining - oh, and some spores from outer space that replicate humans...The alien body snatchers are devoid of emotion and submit to a group-think, "free of anxiety, free of fear or hate, or love" (sounds vaguely Republican), and become automatons (yep! definitely Republican) that simply carry around big eggs that hatch the next generation of snatchers.When these spores recreate a human, they destroy the human counterpart, which might explain the American Republican Party in 2009, with the likes of thoughtless ditto-drogues Bobby Jindal, John Boehner and Eric Cantor. Where are the MEN IN BLACK when you need 'em? Donald Sutherland is a San Francisco health inspector with a white-fro that somehow passed approval with the FDA, heading a small group of humans who evade the body snatchers and fight back. There is Brooke Adams doing her junior Karen Allen, who lives with her shiftless boyfriend who suddenly becomes un-shiftless one morning, giving away his body-snatched persona; Jeff Goldblum, nerve-janglingly skeletal - but still doing his funny Jeff Goldblum impersonations; and Veronica Cartwright in the panic-stricken mode she would become famous for in ALIEN (1979). After the plant-like spores are identified as bringing the body-snatchers to Earth, in an exchange with Goldblum, Cartwright voices an interesting point about alien invasions: "Why do we always expect metal ships?" To which Goldblum provides the comedic rejoinder, "I was never expecting metal ships..." Yet the point is excellent, as Finney's story puts forth a very plausible biological, rather than frontal-assault-forceful, method of invasion; like China invading America with knowledge rather than combat. The Poffy Snatcher If you can stretch your imagination that far, imagine Leonard Nimoy playing a psychiatrist, calm, assuring, emotionless. (I know, I can't imagine it either.) That's before the body-snatchers take him. Afterwards, well, who can tell? One by one, our heroes are snatched tragically, with Brooke Adams doing a grand nude scene for her art. And Jerry Garcia cameoing as the face of a dog! INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS exploits the communism fears of 1955, the "group-think" Orwellian thoughtpolice idiom of forcing everyone to be the same. W.D. Richter's screenplay is shot through with paranoia and foreboding, with a final scene that chills the blood. Spock - I mean - Nimoy's character gives the barest of explanations about the spores: they travel through the cosmos and perpetuate Life wherever they can. Hmm, isn't that how HUMANS terraform other planets without the consent of the life forms already there? I guess "invasion" is just a point of view.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Always enjoyed viewing the older version of the Body Snatchers, however, this film had plenty added with color and very dramatic scenes and very graphic situations and images of horror. Donald Sutherland,(Matthew Bennell),"Ask the Dust", gave an outstanding performance as a Deputy of Health for the City of San Francisco, California, who went around looking for rat turds and another annoying things. Brooke Adams,(Elizabeth Driscoll),"Gas Food Lodging", is a good friend of Matthew and they encounter strange things happening to their husbands and wives and even a Chinese Laundry Owner. Jeff Goldblum,(Jack Bellicec) "Incident at Lock Ness" gave a great supporting role in trying to help Matthew Bennell find out just what was going on with the people of San Francisco. There is great photography around the City of San Francisco, especially the Victorian homes (Alamo Section) inside and out and plenty of trolley cars going up and down the steep hills. There is even some nudity with a certain girl running around topless because of some brain damage. Enjoy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Invasion of the Golden Perms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't believe I hadn't seen this movie before. It stars two of my favorite actors Donald Sutherland and Jeff Goldblum, and even Leonard Nemoy as a kind of swinging psychoanalyst -- which would be reason to watch it alone. Donald Sutherland (with the worst golden perm ever) and Jeff Goldblum join little Brooke Adams (a dead ringer for Genvieve Bujold) in the"Invasion of the Body Snatchers" remake of 1978.How could I have possibly missed this gem?Well, it turns out that despite the super-star power in the movie, it isn't a gem at all. In fact, boy is it bad. But bad in a pretty entertaining way. So we all know the story's premise: that alien life forms come down in the form of spores which turn into large flowering plants that replicate already-existing humans. It's a "get-you-while-you-sleep" kind of thing. When you wake up you're one of them, which honestly didn't seem to be that bad, in my opinion. I mean, the aliens in their human forms seemed very calm and orderly. No one was making any trouble, they were just tending to their plants! But, Sutherland, Goldblum, Nemoy and the rest don't seem to relish the makeover, so they band together and try to stop them.Before I go on, can I just mention one scene that stands out as one of the WEIRDEST things I've ever seen in a movie? Something that might actually give you nightmares, and all the more startling because it was so unexpected. I mean this movie really could be one of the most boring "horror" movies ever made, at least for the first 40 minutes, but then the CREEPIEST HUMAN-FACED DOG FREAK COMES RUNNING OUT! My jaw hit the floor. I mean, WHAT THE HELL?! What writer's alcohol-induced nightmare did this come out of? So then the human-faced dog runs away and the story continues. Ahem.SPOILER ALERTOf course smooth-talking Lenard Nemoy turns out to be one of them, too. I should have known by that weird leather thing he wears on his hand. What IS that? Alien style? It's never explained. Nemoy, wearing a turtleneck and pointy sideburns along with that weird leather thing advises Sutherland "Not to get hung up on old concepts." Then he shoots him up with a sedative. Sutherland says to him, "David you're killing me." I say, David, those side burns are killing me, too.Sutherland TRIES not to get hung up on old concepts, but he just can't help himself. And you can't blame him.In one scene he finally falls asleep and one of the pods starts to replicate him. Like many other elements in this weird boring movie the plants themselves are ridiculous. Straight out of Sid and Marty Crofts reject pile, the cloth-and-wire petals do not look capable of pushing out the DISGUSTING, MEATY, PUS-COVERED human forms that they do. The "special" effects of the births of the new aliens is pretty gross. Call the midwife, anyone?One of the pods pushes out another Donald Sutherland. Suddenly there are TWO golden perms and TWO blonde mustaches, but only one of them is covered in goo! Yuck! Luckily the real Donald wakes up and takes a shovel to his doppelganger's perm, resulting in some really messy effects that were almost worthy of HBO.Unfortunately Goldblum is killed by a red plastic dart to the neck. Dang!!! One of the reasons to watch the movie is gone. But I make myself keep going.Finally, Brooke Adams gets transformed. They got her while she slept. In one scene she strides unexpectedly on screen, completely bare breasted and makes a sound like a dying pig. Totally freaked me out! (I'm sure her real-life parents were dismayed by the turn this role had taken, can you imagine their faces when they saw that scene for the first time? And probably every time after? I wonder if they ever spoke about it at family get-togethers.) Donald is the only one left now. He escapes from the aliens by pulling the old "hide under a bridge while they run by" trick.And--what is up with the gratuitous priest on a swing set scene? The next thing you see Donald is watching a truck unload more pods and the loudspeaker announces the next destinations which happen to be Medford, Eugene, Portland and Vancouver. Hey, maybe THAT'S how all the hipsters got here!The end of the film was just embarrassing. Nobody should make Donald Sutherland make that ridiculous face. And frankly, I did not want to get that close to his mustache.All in all, a really terrible/hilarious/campy movie. Good fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Review Of "Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is very simple to enjoy. There are no major plot twists that can over complicate some stories. This film stays true to its origins. However in the 1956 film the invasion began in a small town and in this film it moves to the big city of San Francisco. This film also plays on the psychology craze that seemed to sweep the nation between the mid 60's and early 80's. Apparently for a while shrinks were the in crowd. I try dealing with them but they just keep wanting to lock me up. It is a conspiracy. Anyway this film is easy to watch and good if your wanting just a hint of horror and mostly looking to feed on nostalgia. The action was pretty weak and the sci-fi was almost non existent at times. The few times that special effects did play out full on in this film was worth it. The scene of the pods giving birth to the doubles is both organic and entertaining. Mostly this picture relies on the cast to act out with emotion and later without emotion to convey the thrills across to the audience. I don't think that it came off quite how the director intended. At times Donald Sutherland looks more like a psycho perv than an emotionally concerned citizen. He definitely didn't know the term "personal space" because he all but crotch rocks Brook Adams in almost every scene they share. Which is a lot because hey!- I noticed!.Leonard Nemoy's character is spot on as a psychiatrist and Jeff Goldblum is almost watchable. This version is almost like watching the more recent adaptation with Nicole Kidman except you don't have to endure Nicole. She ruined "Invasion" for me! One of my favorite stories of all time. All in all this film is watchable and I enjoyed it for what it was- cheeky fun and nostalgic nuance. However the best Body Snatcher movie for me is 1993 version on the military base with Gabrielle Anwar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Much of a Horror Movie, Nor a Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Invasion of the Body Snatchers has an all star cast and a lot of potential. The idea of flower pods cloning humans and leaving behind emotionless creatures (essentially taking the memories and feelings of the humans and compiling them into what I assume is a hive-mind) is neat and the execution isn't bad. It's just the fact that the movie is really boring for the longest time. It's not till about two thirds in that things get exciting and even then it's not all that great. The film goes from a psychological thriller to a zombie movie in essence.There were a couple strange and haunting moments sprinkled throughout but getting to them is the biggest problem, and then they aren't even long enough to care about. There's a romantic subplot that isn't very well-done. None of the characters are really likable.The ending payoff isn't really great either. It's just a lackluster film with good ideas but not enough going on to keep me interested.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst remakes ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a good movie. It is just awful. I can think of remakes better then the originals. But this not one of them. I keep hearing that it is better the the original 1956 version but I honestly don't know why? The original 1956 version is one of the best science fiction movies ever made. And this one is just awful. The story line is awful. The ending is awful. Good actors wasted there talent being in this awful movie. The original is so scary. And this one is just stupid. I can't believe people like this movie. It as great special effects will say that for it. I like a movie with a lot special effects if it is well written. And this is not. They took a great story and ruined it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who in their right mind would want to snatch-and-invade Donald Sutherland's body? Or Veronica Cartwright's, Jeff Goldblum's, and Leonard Nimoy's, for that matter? Not very picky, are they...Some aliens just don't have anything better to do with themselves. Instead of invading proper civilizations, they go to lousy little Earth to muck about with a couple of humanoid morons. And then what? "OK, people, we've invaded all of humanity, even Alan Derschowitz, and now we... Ehm... Er... Geez... Actually, does anyone have any ideas what we're supposed to do now?" "Invade pigs, hamsters and Sean Penn!" "Oh, yeah, good idea... That'll keep us busy for a while." These aliens must be suffering from an inferiority complex. They're not happy with what they see in the mirror. How else do we explain this obsession with taking over another body, and these meticulous preparations to change one's physical appearance? Perhaps one day one of them will invade a very politically correct motivational speaker whose mind will tell them to "learn to love yourself as you are!". We're all beautiful, no matter what they say, words can't bring me...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clumsy, outdated, overrated, slow and dumb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure had a snippet of an idea but just didn't know what to do with it. The science fiction aspect felt dumb, cinematography was too dying to please and the direction is confused whether to make a meaningful drama or a mindless thriller. At the end it did not please me on any department. People getting cloned from a biological pod down to their hairstyle, aliens has the technology to travel from planet to planet but could not make it from point A to B to catch a few fugitives. Overall, it was not well thought out and even badly executed.Matthew Bennell (Donald Sutherland) is an officer from the public health department who is friends in a one-sided love with married Elizabeth (Brooke Adams). One day she announces that her husband is not the same person anymore after she brings in a strange flower she finds on the street. With a few more incidents on similar lines, Matthew takes it a bit more seriously and finds out the human beings are being replaced by Alien clones and the entire government and public services are already replaced. With him, Elizabeth, Jack (Jeff Goldblum) and his wife being considered fugitives, they become desperate to find a way out.One of the poorly executed science fiction movies of the time. It neither worked as sci-fi drama nor a thriller with a good central idea but a very dumb way of implementing it. The unnecessary gimmicks in photography, very loud background score, an irritating nerd of a Jeff Goldblum, poor pacing - everything about it felt wrong. Brooke Adams is very inconsistent with masterful dialogue diction at times and unnecessary screaming and whining otherwise. Donald Sutherland just looked uninterested with the whole mess happening around him. Since the script was originally written in the 50s, I don't think this version didn't seem to upgraded itself (cannot confirm since I have not seen the original) as the technology looked outdated even for its time to be a science fiction.Clumsy, outdated, overrated, slow and dumb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsettling but unsatisfying...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ham-handed remake/follow-up to the 1958 suspense classic, directed with energy and flair by Philip Kaufman but weighed down by the non-sensibilities in W.D. Richter's hectic script. Alien pods are replacing human beings with robot-like replicants, and Kaufman does a great job at setting the scene: following believably eccentric San Franciscans through the city as mysterious flowers begin popping up all over. Curly-headed Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams are very companionable co-stars, and they match up with each other amiably. Once the horror mounts however, the film scrambles around for an ending, with some over-the-top theatrics that don't work and a final third that verges on depressing. Kaufman is vigilant that his version of this story won't end happily (like the original did); that's fine, but his conception, while at times admirable, is eventually ugly and dispiriting instead of scary. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a feeling seeing this remake film that I would want to see the original first, which I didn't, I think the only good thing about this film is the stars. Basically some alien flowers are planted on earth in amongst some already grown ones, and Elizabeth Driscoll (Brooke Adams) is the first one to see it and take it. Everything is normal, and then a little while later her husband is acting secretly and meeting people he has never met before, and many other people are complaining about these changes in their close-ones' lives. Hygiene expert Matthew Bennell (Donald Sutherland) along with Elizabeth and some friends, Jack Bellicec (a young Jeff Goldblum), Nancy Bellicec (Alien's Veronica Cartwright) and Dr. David Kibner (Star Trek's Leonard Nimoy) are questioning but also confident to try and find the problem. Eventually they find out the flower is alien, and that people are being cloned by pods, almost like a vagina. I did fall asleep somewhere, but I did wake up to see the amusing sound and face of Sutherland as the climax. I really need to see the original. Worth watching, at least once!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Leonard Nimoy? Donald Sutherland? Jeff Goldblum? I did not know all three of these people had somehow in the late 70s were cast for the 1st remake of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers". Well, when you watch it you realize that maybe you are glad it was them and not you. Unless you want to cast for a sub-par project.Plants, their spores, and other things are invading the U.S. Jeff Goldblum is here to help fend off the invasion. And Leonard Nimoy seems to be a nonbeliever throughout much of the movie. But despite the irregular chase scenes and odd instances were plants and destroying cars, nothing really exciting happens. Or, dumb enough to be funny. Its just dumb.Yes I know I could be missing the point. But I am glad to do it. "F"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Attack of the Clones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In San Francisco, alien pods replicate humans and turn the population into emotionless robots. This lavish remake of the low-budget 1956 classic has elaborate special effects showing how the cloning occurs. However, given how slow and inefficient the cloning process is, it is hard to believe that the entire population of a city is cloned within a couple of days. McCarthy and Siegel, star and director of the original, make cameo appearances and serving as reminder that this version falls far short of the original. Whereas the Siegel film had a spooky atmosphere, this one is all about special effects. Kaufman employs an odd visual style that is rather distracting.</fullReview>
