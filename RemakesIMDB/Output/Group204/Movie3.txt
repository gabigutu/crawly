		<shortDescription>Invasion of the Script Snatchers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Invasion" had a lot going for it. It had two big stars, an acclaimed director, a big time producer, and a time tested premise. The only thing missing was a script."The Invasion" does not follow the same story as the earlier movies. They took the premise and made a new story. The new story has only a threadbare plot, no character development, and some of the most banal dialog I have heard in recent years. At 93 minutes, there are long passages that go nowhere and do nothing for the story.Whoever gave the green light to this production without having a decent script first should be fired.Despite that, there are some parts that are watchable. It is just frustrating that they could not have come up with a better story and better characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad... just not award worthy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know much about Invasion before I walked into this movie. I heard the bad reviews from critics but hell, who listens to them? While watching this movie, I wasn't aware that The Invasion was re-filmed and rewritten. Apparently they rewrote it to add the twist in the end, as well as they added more action sequences with faster and better-angled camera work.So the movie starts off right away with Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman) scattering around the medicine cabinet in a Pharmacy whispering "stay awake, don't fall asleep" to herself. The neat fast-paced camera work kept you right into the movie from the beginning, but sadly the amazing beginning just doesn't match up to the pathetic ending. It seemed like they got tired of writing the movie so they decided to end it off with a simply and quick ending.Some organism from a different planet crashed down to Earth and took over the citizens of the world. When the organism comes in contact with a human, they will become a different alien-ish like being obsessed with capturing people and affecting the world with their plague. When each person was affected, they would turn into these emotionless, mindless and painless zombies while they sleep. In search of her son, Carol Bennell gets affected and must stay awake so she would be able to save her boy. With help from Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig) and his team of doctors, they go on the search for a cure, to save humanity and especially, save Carol.I find that this movie gave off the message it was trying to, but in the process it failed at almost everything else. I was expecting, before walking into this movie that it would be filled with suspense with my heart jumping ever so often... but I wasn't scared or thrilled once. The suspense scenes had great music playing, had the great camera angles, but was just missing the spice to make it really work. And in regards to the end of the movie... I can promise you the writers got tired of having to rewrite a story and just through in a quick, painless ending. Course the quick painless ending resulted in annoyance for the audience.While I walked out of the theater, I was thinking about this movie and how I would interpret it. One thing came to my head, and it was that the new directors did what they were supposed to - make me think and remember this movie once I leave the theater. This was NOT a forgettable movie, rather quite memorable. Sure there was a bad ending, but my eyes were attached to the screen throughout the whole film. I didn't look at my watch once, and for me that gives this movie a big bonus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad..Nicole lookin good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We went to see this last night. After all of the horrific reviews, I was expecting a real P.O.S. I was pleasantly surprised. While not to say it was an AWESOME movie or anything. It was good Sci Fi fun. I get irritated when a lot of movie buffs are looking for every film to be a Gone with the Wind or something. This was just a fun, smooth, entertaining production. I've never been a real fan of Nicole kidman, but I must say, she was quite fetching in this movie. If you are looking for the 50's version of War of the Worlds..The forbidden planet..John Carpenter's the THING...etc..it doesn't qualify. If you are looking for a fun Sci Fi Thriller to watch, it does the job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blame it on the Hollywood suits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly don't think the movie is worth an 8, not in its released form. But since the cuts and additions from the suits are so painfully obvious, I'm willing to give a higher rating to the movie that could have been... and for now, only the original director Oliver something has seen.So the original movie (which is still discernible somehow) was supposed to be a dark, slow take on isolation, pill overuse and boring modern life. With a twist: a mom so desperate to protect her child, she would silently watch other people being killed as long as she can find her kid. That's actually moving and seldom seen in a macho-dominated Hollywood. I won't say that ice cold Kidman is the right choice to depict a desperate mom, but given that her role is to often look emotionless (so she can pass as another "pod people") she doesn't do too badly.Now, the suits didn't like that and called those soft-brained Wachowski bros to make it -supposedly- more mainstream. And what they did was to add car chases, crashes, helicopters, fires and senseless violence in general. Inserted into the original movie at close intervals to keep people amused (or so they thought). Now, there are a few good directors who can pull out a combination of slow burn and crazy action. But a patchwork movie made of two different directors' bits, guys with widely opposed instincts and goals, no wonder the result is a flop.If anything is to be learned from this, it's how little do Hollywood executives know about what makes a good movie. Granted, a non-stop mishmash of violence and fifth-drink bar philosophy like The Matrix can earn the big bucks, but you can't expect Matrix-like bits to improve what was intended to be a slow paced, moody film. Which was probably condemned to be a box office failure, but also could have been pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taunt and Smart, Kidman shines here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this is not a scary movie. Instead, there is an atmosphere of tenseness, especially when Kidman and Craig's characters must pretend to have already changed in order to survive. Kidman easily carries this film, and she makes you believe the plot line that another actress would have easily made ludicrous. I have read some critical reviews questioning the casting of Kidman in this role, mostly due to the fact that her icy demeanor is seemingly miscast in a role that calls for emotion. However, I believe that it is this very demeanor that allows her to be believable in this film. She plays an extremely smart psychologist who catches on to the situation fast. She is an analyzer, and it is her lack of deep emotion that allows for her to think quickly and critically, without it, she would have easily succumbed to the body snatchers and there would have been no movie. There is indeed a liberal undercurrent through this movie. It questions our role in Iraq but more importantly, it questions our actions as a species, our emotions, our anger, our selfishness, and their effects on our society. To create a world in which everyone is equal, rational, no war, no disease, no famine, no inequality is what the body snatchers are offering...and for this movie goer, there was at least one point in the film in which I found myself asking whether that would be so bad. Sure, the ending was a little too quick and tidy, but overall, this was a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At turns mind-numbingly obvious and clichéd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually went into this movie with pretty high expectations, considering that the Wachowski brothers were involved and it seemed like an interesting premise from the trailers. Well, as it turned out, somehow all of that potential was utterly wasted. From beginning to end this movie is boring, predictable, and terribly clichéd. I kept hoping until the end that at some point it would get better, but bit for bit everything in this movie is the epitome of all that is trite and stale in sci-fi movies and little to nothing of what is interesting and original. Every crummy sci-fi/horror movie starts out with little hints of whatever fantastic thing is supposed to happen later, and so did The Invasion. Except, in The Invasion this whole section keeps pointing out things to the audience that were mind-numbingly obvious. "My husband is not my husband anymore..." Oh really? Well surely she's just some nut-case and it has nothing to do with the storyline that's been explained on TV commercials and in movie trailers for the past several months! I honestly don't understand why filmmakers like these frequently feel the need to spend half of the movie beating the audience over the head with information that they could (and probably already did) find in a one sentence synopsis of the film. Per the typical, trite sci-fi/horror movie formula there's also a scene where the main character brings a same of something weird to a scientist and he examines it and conveniently explains everything that the audience needs to know about the substance/disease/alien race in a straightforward, uninteresting way. There are so many scenes like this where the characters are supposed to be revealing something new and interesting but it just comes out as if the writers think that the audience is a a bunch of slobbering morons who can't take a simple hint. Here's one detail that particularly struck me for its idiocy: about a third of the way through the movie, there's a scene where the Russian guy (who cares what his name is) basically explains (through a convenient monologue) the thesis of the movie which goes something like, "a world without newspapers constantly talking about violence and hatred is a world without humanity." Later on, there are some segments showing on a TV that say that fighting has ended in Iraq and then Daniel Craig's character gives another speech that is very obviously supposed to be a counterpoint to the first one that goes something like, "in our world, there is no need to hurt one another." At the end, after the aliens are nearly destroyed Daniel Craig talks about how 87 people just died in Iraq. As if ALL this information wasn't enough to make you draw some sort of a connection, they just have to drill it directly into your skull by replaying the Russian guy's quote again. I could mention plenty more things like this, but I'm starting to get annoyed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 70s remake of this film succeeded because it was a chilling psychological thriller with little to no horror film elements and a biting ending that lingered with you for days.This film starts out with the premise and setup, but quickly deviates into a different film -- a rehashing of 28 days later and outbreak with illogical, formulaic action sequences that are literally lifted straight from any zombie film. As usual with sub-par screenplays, the plot requires illogical and implausible events to move forward and provide thrills. In the end, it couldn't make up its mind whether it was an intellectually compelling, psychological thriller or yet another zombie action film? The ending was ... eh I don't even want to explain it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood destroyed everything good about this film. There was a resounding creepiness that looms over the body snatcher remakes and the original. This film misses that on every mark. No pods... No siren screams... And the ending, well, is a slap in the face to the concept.If your not a fan or have never seen any other versions you might think it is OK. But thats it, just OK. They screwed up one of the scariest concepts ever thought up. Permormences were OK. It had one or two bright points but overall it was crap. Take the cgi out of war of the worlds and you have invasion... thats not a good thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Perfect But Still Very Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit that I was hesitant about seeing "The Invasion" after reading some poor reviews and coming to this message board. I also was leery after learning that part of it was re-shot by different directors which is usually a very bad sign. Plus the fact that they give Kidman a kid in this film had me leery for I often grow weary of female leads in suspense/action/horror films having to protect children instead of other adults like male leads do especially if the kids are annoying.So, I almost didn't see "The Invasion" after reading and hearing all of the complaints about no plot, no real character development, bad acting and poor directing/editing.Yet, I finally agreed to just go with my gut and take a chance on a matinée show of "The Invasion." Boy, am I glad that I did, not only because I did not have to pay the outrageous full price of ten bucks but I actually liked this film.Despite what some are saying this film does have a plot. People are actually doing things that lead to other plot points like the whole deal with Veronica Cartwright's character and Kidman's character leaving her son with the ex-husband. These two story lines lead to important discoveries and actions that happen later on in the film.Also, there is character development. Kidman's character does develop because she's forced to change in order to survive and to protect herself and her son. The warm relationship between Kidman's character and her son and Ben also is established.So beyond these relationships do we really need to dwell on the other characters for too long? After all this is a plot driven movie not a character driven movie. Besides, if they had taken time to thoroughly get into everyone else's back story people would be whining about the movie being too long. But I digress.Also, I thought that all of the actors did a good job especially Kidman. She showed good range from being a caring psychiatrist, to a loving mother to a terrified woman to a desperate mother who would do anything to protect her child. I also like the mood and tone of this film. Granted the Pod People in the 1956 and 1978 versions were a tad bit creepier but I liked this film better than the 1978 version overall and I didn't miss that crazy scream. However, the 1956 version is definitely a classic.Sure "The Invasion" is not perfect and it has it flaws and I feel that the studio probably should have left the original version alone. After all, the majority of the film is stronger than the last half which is obviously where the re-shoots took place. Still despite the unnecessary out of order time cuts, and a tad too many car crashes, the film still worked for me. I was definitely entertained.Now that's saying a lot especially since I went in with low expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not Sleep!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While returning to Earth, the space-bus explodes and the fragments bring an alien virus that recodes the human DNA. In Washington, the psychiatrist Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman) observes the modification of the behavior of one of her clients first, then in her former husband and finally in the population in general. Together with her friend Dr. Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig) and the researcher Dr. Stephen Galeano (Jeffrey Wright), they discover that the extraterrestrial epidemic affects human beings while sleeping and that her son Ollie, who had smallpox with Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) when he was a baby, is immune to the disease and may save mankind from the outbreak.Don Siegel's "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" is one of the best sci-fi ever, therefore most of the remakes are good because the story of earth being invaded through replicas of the human beings is excellent. "The Invasion" is maybe the third remake of the classic that I have watched and I liked it in spite of having an optimistic and corny conclusion. I do not dare to compare the classic movie of Don Siegel with this remake, but I have found it very reasonable and entertaining. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Invasores" ("Invaders")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Kept an Open Mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You hafta' go into every movie with an open mind if you're going to give it a fair assessment, right? Well, I did exactly that with "The Invasion". Despite all the heavy and (quite) ugly criticism this movie received, it had a fair cast and it isn't too often that Nicole Kidman is in something completely awful. Let it be known, as well, that I am a big fan of both the original and the 1978 versions of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers". It is reasonable to speculate that fans of either of those two films will be disappointed with this latest stab at the "body snatcher" storyline.However, I asked myself, is the point to compare this film against its predecessors or should I evaluate this film on its own merits alone? I decided the latter was the right course and with this in mind, I watched "The Invasion".The film opens with a very frantic Carol Bennell (played by Nicole Kidman) rummaging through the shelves of a pharmacy. She is searching for sleep suppressants. We are then taken back in a recent past where a space shuttle crash lands into the countryside. The shuttle's wreckage has brought back something with it. From the moment that Bennell's ex-husband (played Jeremy Northam) pricks his fingers on a foreign organism, life becomes a serious drag for the (evidently, terrible) human species. Bennell, who is a psychiatrist, doesn't get it at first when one of her patients (played by Veronica Cartwright who also starred in the 1978 "Invasion of the Body Snatchers) irately claims her husband isn't her husband. But it doesn't take long before Bennell figured out that all is not right in Everytown, USA.This film was not awful. This was, by no means, the worst of the "snatchers" make-overs. 1993's "Body Snatchers" is my nominee for that award. There were some moments in this film that worked well such as a brief, but tense scene when Bennell and her son (played by Jackson Bond) are unsure whether the other is... them. I also liked the "attempt" at a different approach to the body snatching "method". All in all, for me what kept me watching was Kidman. No, not just because she's a super-hottie (although it never hurts.) She adeptly became Bennell and breathed life into her character. I actually thought this was one of her better performances. This could have been an excellent film, but as is all too often the case these days, character development was not a priority. Beyond Kidman as Bennell, character development was non-existent. How people are being snatched, also, is never adequately, not even remotely, explained. Wherein the other snatcher films, while the victim sleeps their body rotted away and their alien replacement is created within a giant pea-pod, in "The Invasion" the process is never identified. This makes for a very weak ending. Truly, with today's SFX, this could have been an extraordinary "revelation". What was most disappointing was the attempt at social and political commentary. Good grief! I cannot think of a more articulate adjective then just plain...lame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't even bother to find fault with it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't always listen to film critics but when three reasonably reliable ones all give this movie a 2/4, I should take heed. Why did I watch it then? I am a Nicole Kidman fan. Sure enough, Kidman was in every scene, if not every frame. But that was about it.I won't even bother finding fault with this movie because it is so formulaic that it gives you everything you expect, which isn't much. If you watch close to 200 movies a year (granted not all of them Hollywood), you have seen them all ? divorced professional mother with young (ten-ish) son and good-guy boyfriend, mass hysteria in which you just don't know which one is a sinister "them", just to name the two key elements. There is really nothing seriously wrong about this movie ? that a woman and her son have become the only people among thousands in the city that are unaffected is something that Hollywood expects you to accept without as much as a blink. Nor is the split-personality change (of the movie, I mean) from a dark, sinister suspense into a chaotic havoc of wild chases anything that you should really criticize because you've got to have these things in the movie. By the way, this movie is a sort of a partial remake of "Invasion of the body snatches", if you don't already know and whether it's the fourth or the fifth depends on who you talk to.Yes, there are some good, damned good actors in the caliber of Daniel Craig, Jeremy Northam and Jeffrey Wright but in this movie they may as well be props. A terrible waste, you say, but these people got to have a paycheck every now and then too. So in the end, there's just Kidman. This isn't exactly her bid for another Oscar, but she does a fine job here, limited scope notwithstanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Remake Gone Bad........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't go into details telling about this film. Simply this is just another remake gone bad. For those who wish to be thrilled and scared, see the 1978 film "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." It scared the crap out of me when I was young. I never forgot it either. Unfortunately, this film will be forgotten as quickly as it was thrown together and released.It's amazing how a film over 20 years old could be better than this pile of steaming #$@#*. But the fact is that the further we move along in technology, the worse the films seem to get. All imagination and creativity seem to have been lost. I am probably the worst critic of them all. I haven't seen much of anything in new millennium releases that I would call outstanding or even good. This film is no different, and I suggest that anyone having been born early enough to remember the original or even 78's version, don't waste your time on this pathetic attempt. It's just a sad, lackluster, unimaginative pop-corn affair.</fullReview>

Now after reading that the producers brought in another director then re-wrote &amp; re-shot chunks of this movies you understand the disjointed feel of this movie. There is a flow that happens on the set of movies that gels most movies together. So often good actors pull a poor script up and we get a fairly good movie as a result.

		<shortDescription>Worse than you might think, considering the talent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Invasion | 3/10 We are all finally greeted with the 49th remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and yes, it's every bit as unnecessary as you might think. Considering the talent involved in this project, however, I'm actually a bit disturbed at how bad it turned out. Oliver Hirschbiegel directed the outstanding WWII film "Downfall" a few years ago, and Nicole Kidman is among Hollywood's greatest actresses of this or any other era. Baffled by how terrible the film turned out to be, I did some research. Apparently the producers of the film weren't happy with Hirschbiegel's vision, so they went ahead and had a completely different director (James McTeigue, director of V for Vendetta) re-shoot entire scenes. This was clearly a terrible idea, but probably not the only reason for it's failure.The plot presented here, as thin as it is to begin with, basically goes nowhere at all. Kidman's character contracts the 'virus' from her ex-husband in an attempt to take her child from him to a treatment center of sorts. What's worse is that nothing of even remote interest happens before this, and we're not exactly treated to edge of your seat suspense afterwards, either. Kidman spends the rest of the film in search of this so-called treatment center while finding out along the way that her son is somehow immune to the virus. The virus, for the sake of information, can only fully convert you after you enter REM sleep. It's alien nature and motive are barely touched upon at all. There is of course the obligatory sub plot of lovers, unconvincingly played out between Kidman and Craig, that are best friends but really think it's best if they stayed that way even though they clearly want to be with each other. You know, the usual Lifetime network effect. We're also given a handful of mediocre to terrible supporting characters that are each given their share of awful dialogue to delight us with.I suppose it's not among the worst films I've ever seen, but it is without a doubt a miserable one. There are a few solid scenes with Kidman that quite literally save this from being a complete and utter waste of 93 minutes, but even those are few and far between. On the whole the film fails at literally every genre it attempts or presents, from Sci-Fi to Action and, worst of all, Horror. This is the least horrifying Horror film I've ever had the displeasure of sitting through. I hope for the sake of film that this talented director chooses to build on the promise he showed in Downfall by putting this embarrassment as far behind him as possible. To his credit, though, I would have to assume that whatever Hirschbiegel originally filmed was at least a few steps above the final product that was somehow unleashed upon the viewer.</fullReview>

The newest thing here is that the zombies sometimes kind of spit/vomit on their victims,a new thing that i just couldn't appreciate!The best new variation here is the addition of a story plot stating the fact that her kid couldn't be contaminated and therefore has to be eliminated.This then gaves a very powerful motivation to escape,a motivation that anybody can understand.The additional scenes involving what seems to be a two part car chase(one with fire on the car and one without)is just too little, too late to turn this average film into a must see film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than I thought, tension but not terror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should start this off by saying I saw the 1978 Invasion of the Body Snatchers when I was seven years old. I think I still have nightmares of the final scene. That said, this 2007 remake (the Invasion) has some moments of edge of your seat tension, along with a few screams by a raucous preview crowd.I think Nicole Kidman does a good job as Carol Bennell, a professional, single mom whose world revolves around her son Oliver and her job as a psychiatrist. The movie starts with a quick snap-shot of Carol desperately trying to take meds and caffeine to stay awake. I didn't think that scene was necessary, as all the previews and tag-lines have stressed the "do Not Fall Asleep" theme.The alien invasion comes by way of another tragic Shuttle incident. This is a necessary plot point but is hardly expanded upon.For most of the movie the turned human-aliens pursue Carol as she desperately tries to get to her son. It seems almost matter of fact that while what seems like 99% of the city's population is after her, she stays pretty calm. I won't state much else about the plot details only to say that it seemed to me that for a good portion of the movie, all you see are human chase scenes... lots of running and car chases. Nothing really scary about any of them.I had fore-warned my wife that given my experience with the 1978 Sutherland/Goldblum movie that she would be terrified. That was not the case at all, she actually liked the tense scenes and enjoyed the movie as a whole, but scared she was not. I liked the movie and have purposely left out any references to politics or commentaries on the current state of the world. I thought some of those scenes were crow-barred into the film.Just my 2 cents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fourth is the Worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is already the fourth large-scaled film version based on Jack Finney's legendary story "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" and I must say this is just one too many. The two oldest films (the 50's film directed by Don Siegel and the 70's version by Philip Kaufman) are righteously regarded at as genre milestones, but the "newer" films don't manage to convey the creepy basic premise in a good old-fashioned and atmospheric way. Abel Ferrara's 1993 film "Body Snatchers" still contained a few very effective moments of fright, but this latest; big-names-involved version became somewhat of a disappointment. It's is clearly noticeable that director Oliver Hirschbiegel ("Downfall", "The Experiment") wanted to make his English language debut like a genuine throwback to paranoid &amp; claustrophobic 50's Sci-Fi, with enthralling suspense, mysteriousness and character development. Unfortunately, however, the producers wanted more spectacle and explosions, and thus hired other people for re-writes and re-shoots. The finished product evidently suffers from this, so my advice would be to try and focus as much as possible on the substantially terrific sequences and the creepily-themed ambiance. The familiar concept is still, according to me at least, the archetype of superior Science Fiction. What if some sort of extraterrestrial force caused people to metamorphose into soulless, emotionless and insensitive replicas of themselves overnight? For some reason, I always found this the most nightmarishly plausible Sci-Fi formula, and apparently many genre fanatics with me. This time, the "epidemic" is generated when a US Space Shuttle, containing the unidentified alien substance, crashes down on earth. Shortly after, the entire population is gradually getting replaced by exact copies. Psychiatrist Carol Bennell desperately tries to get to her son, who's staying with his estranged father and happened to be one of the first victims of the infection. Apart from a couple of really powerful sequences and a few isolated moments of pure shock (the tunnel-accident, for example), "The Invasion" is a rather redundant movie that adds absolutely nothing to the original masterpieces. The alien menace isn't very detectable here and the fear in the eyes of the survivors is never fully convincing. The additions to the original storyline, like for example the sub plot on immunity, are inefficient and not compelling. Nicole Kidman, of whom I'm usually not a big fan, is quite good looking in this film and her performance is more than adequate. Her male co-stars Daniel Craig, Jeremy Northam and Jeffrey Wright all give away much more intense and plausible performances, however. I hope that, one day, perhaps Hirschbiegel director's cut will be available and we get to see the film as it was initially intended: slow-brooding, uncanny and petrifying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Projectile Vomit isn't just a *feature* of this movie - it's the perfect summary of what this movie *is*!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note: It was not my choice to give this movie one star. I would have chosen to give it zero stars, but there is no option to do so.The Invasion is a very badly done remake of 3 previous "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" films. Each of the 3 prior films was a masterpiece. The Invasion is, simply put, projectile vomit.Why does projectile vomit come to mind, you may be wondering. The reason is, because projectile vomit is *literally* spewing out of everyone's mouths constantly &amp; gratuitously in the movie The Invasion. You see, in The Invasion, they have done away with the sophisticated method for turning people into emotionless, zombie-like drones from the 3 previous films. In the 3 previous films, there was a process called "podification" that accomplished this. An alien, plant-like pod would discreetly start growing next to and entangling itself with a host body while he or she slept, and then it would create an exact clone body of his or hers, and then destroy the host.But all that is way too "outdated" and not nearly so "hip" enough for The Invasion remake from 2007, in which the whole podification process is discarded and in it's place, you guessed it: projectile vomit. The aliens, the pod people from all the previous 3 films are completely absent in The Invasion and in it's place you have humans who turn each other into drones by literally spewing projectile vomit onto each other. If you think it sounds disgusting, you are right. Actually having the misfortune to be subjected to it in the movie is far more disgusting than me describing it though, so if you read this review then decide that a movie based on projectile vomit is not your cup of tea, then I have done you a favor by disgusting you somewhat now to save you from being even more disgusted from seeing it live on-screen. Oh, word to the wise: don't let that cup of tea anywhere near the virus carriers in this movie, as they have been known to spew projectile vomit into tea cups as their one and only "stealth tactic". Although usually, they spread the virus simply by projectile vomiting into each other's faces. It is notable that while the other 3 films featured an alien race invading and taking over the Earth, "The Invasion" only features a virus; no aliens. Despite being entitled The *Invasion*! Go figure. Maybe they got so excited by their brilliant projectile vomit film-making innovation, that they forgot the title no longer fit the movie they were making. The trademark, scary, much-beloved alien shriek and finger pointing from all 3 previous films is also absent from The Invasion.The acting in this movie is universally terrible across the board. Nicole Kidman appears as if she is an emotionless drone in every single scene of the movie, starting with the very first one. But, she is *supposed* to be playing a normal woman, not a drone, so you can see why the whole movie slips on it's own projectile vomit and falls flat on it's face when the lead actress is *required* to be emotional for the premise of the movie to work, yet due to the actress chosen for the role, she is incapable to be emotional. There has been some compelling suggestions that perhaps it is botox that Nicole Kidman has injected which has caused her face to become incapable of moving in recent years. One thing is certain: her face certainly does not move at all in The Invasion, and there is little if any discernible way to tell Nicole from a projectile vomit drone victim at any point in this movie. They are equally emotionless due to bad acting on Kidman's part.Whilst driving in this movie, Nicole Kidman completely turns around - while the vehicle is moving - to look at and talk to her son who is in the backseat. This is an act of lunacy. But it is played off in the movie as a "normal thing to do". Not only is this bad for the character in the movie, it is also socially irresponsible that the lead character, the role model, the "hero" of the film, is shown to be driving in a ludicrously reckless way. If anyone watches this movie and then comes to think that to turn around to look at and talk to someone in the backseat while driving is acceptable behavior, that could tragically lead to unnecessary fatalities in real-life. I suppose the projectile vomit innovation taking up most of the film makers' thoughts is again the reason why they didn't bother to pay any attention to this.This movie was extensively re-shot by the brothers who made the Matrix films. Perhaps the original cut of the movie was somewhat sophisticated. But The Invasion that was released certainly was not. All the Matrix brothers did was add some extravagant car crash special effects to the movie. That's it. I suppose if you want to see some expensive car crashes, this movie might be for you. But if you are expecting a decent story, decent acting, aliens, or a movie that lives up the legendary brand name of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", you will be sadly disappointed with "The Invasion".Needless to say, "The Invasion" is *easily* and *by far* the worst Invasion of the Body Snatchers movie. It's not even a good movie on it's own, even if one pretends the other Body Snatchers movies don't exist.Do yourself a favor. Pass on The Invasion and rent all 3 of the previous "Body Snatchers" films; each of which is vastly superior to "The Invasion" in every conceivable way. And best of all, they don't have any projectile vomit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, perhaps that's excessively harsh but this was a terrible movie. The brief special effects didn't improve this over the 1978 version and even good acting by Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig couldn't take an inane screenplay, poor cinematography, and even poorer directing and make it good.The Screenplay author was LAZY!! He wanted to do as little as possible to deliver his story and so there are plot holes that you could drive a truck through.The special effects were Cheezy. OOOOh I'm really scared when I find a disgusting prop. The little bit of CGI didn't make up for the 90 minutes.See the 1978 version or the 1950s version but steer clear of this dog!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another generic remake with feminist touch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is all about a mom groping and kissing his son and underlining how unnecessary and obnoxious dads really are for little boys. And oh, there is a generic "invasion" plot too.As for main characters, Nicole Kidman is starring as a single mom with a boy (of course its not a girl) and works as a psychiatric for some kind of feminist help center. Daniel Graig is just some kind of ad-hoc lapdog boyfriend who is only called for help when needed. And then there is the dad who pretty quickly turns into the "dark side" and can be hit with an iron bar. Movie pretty much goes like mom and son running around the city avoiding bad guys. There is no suspense, acting is throughly wooden and plot is non- existent ripoff from previous body snatcher movies without any twists. The amount of plot holes and illogical behavior is high as would be expected from a dumbed down remake of a remake. There is a few good special effects if something positive must be said. Thats it. I can't think of anything more to say from this POS. The movie is maybe worth 3 or 4 out of 10 but as a protest depicting dads as "locusts", I give this crap 1/10. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many cooks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This updating of Jack Finney's 'Body Snatchers' story, directed (according to the credits anyway) by Oliver Hirschbiegel of the gripping last-days-of-Hitler film 'The Downfall,' clumsily interweaves a low-keyed mood piece with some loud mayhem--noisy car chases and a helicopter rescue in which Nicole Kidman proves to be a mean racing driver. She also on several occasions kills some people in cold blood--rare moments of fun for an audience starved for a little violence relevant to the original plot. There isn't a lot else happening on screen, despite the fact that masses of Americans are being "turned" by an alien virus into soberly dressed, tidy zombies whose aim is to create a more orderly, peaceful world. The irony--though clearly underdeveloped--is that this positive transformation isn't what people want. "They," the infected ones, are trapping people, infecting them, and taking away their personalities. They sneeze on them and the virus takes effect during their REM sleep. There's a new twist somewhere here about how visions of a better world get compromised in the execution, but it gets lost in the botched result.There are no monsters or gooey ectoplasm, just little sheaths of clear tissue and some people whose faces glaze over--all of which, from the horror-action-movie standpoint, comes off as pretty tame. And the creepy psychological elements--and the ideas about various social and political issue--aren't allowed to develop fully either.This new scaling down of the old story appears to have all the earmarks of a low budget piece except a low budget. With big crowd scenes and the likes of Craig and Kidman signed on, it must have cost a few bucks. Actually, Craig did this before he got the 007 franchise, which explains a lot. In any case the technical package reads as mediocre. Lacking is the spectacular excitement of the 'Alien' movies or earlier 'Body Snatchers' ones---or the military ironies and fast action of the recent '28 Weeks Later,' which like this (which is set in DC), is full of political references. But in the case of '28 Weeks' the political satire is integrated into the action in ways that are far more cinematic and satirically effective. What went wrong here?Apparently what happened to 'The Invasion' was too many surgeries by opposing doctors. Hirschbiegel originally had a low-keyed horror movie going on; we feel its chilling menace in the early sequences. Then, because of some poor test audience responses, the producers called upon the Wachowski brothers to inject some "action" into the piece. This was when uncredited sub-director James McTeigue came along. The disconnect is super-evident. Implausibility would have perhaps been inevitable in this story anyway, but the clumsy patchwork destroys the mood and resolves everything with super-conventional rescues and a too-easy off-scene medical solution that restores everything to normal. Oliver's little friend Gene (Eric Benjamin) who had turned into a nasty little monster, is suddenly "cured" at the end and, having lost his parents, now lives with them. That's unintentionally creepy, and a sign of how poorly structured the screenplay wound up being with too many cooks.The tie-in between the alien virus and the leads is simply made. Carol Bennell (Kidman) is a psychiatrist. People are certainly beginning to act strangely and as a behavior professional she's qualified to note that. Those who've "turned" don't sweat or show emotion. Ms. Kidman says, "My patient's husband was infected by an alien virus and all I did was prescribe an anti-psychotic drug. What an idiot I am!" Yes, but how was she to know? Her ex-husband Tucker (Jeremy Northam) has "turned," and when Carol suspects this, Tucker's sudden desire to have their little boy Oliver (Jackson Bond) spend time with him after a two-year absence is deeply sinister. (This movie might not be good for small children whose parents have separate households.) Carol's boyfriend--wait, make that "best friend"--Ben (Daniel Craig), is a doctor, who luckily knows Dr. Stephen Galeano (Jeffrey Wright, a brilliant actor completely wasted here), an ace virus scientist. The creepy menace of early scenes, which is truly disturbing, is thrown away with a too-easy resolution when vaguely referenced government efforts come together, the invasion is eradicated (off screen) and little Oliver is saved from his creepy dad.A movie like 'The Invasion,' which takes an old zombie/alien theme and injects it with some political references, incidentally makes one realize why Phillip K. Dick's writing is so often adapted to the screen: Dick's books and stories are packed with original and provocative ideas. The thinking behind The Invasion is sloppy and skimpy. It seems to be talking primarily about how chilling and oppressive do-gooders can be. This could be seen as a dark vision of how projects to make the world better may be compromised by authoritarianism. Jeffrey Wright is in the lab finding a cure, and as Americans get their humanity back, violence starts up again. The way to stay human is to keep the world a mess. The irony is heavy handed. Iraq, Iraq, Iraq comes at us from TV screens; then as those infected with the alien virus begin to take over, there is peace. The idea of a conflict between wanting to change for the better and clinging to our old animal instincts is potentially an interesting one. But it's not helped in this movie by throwing in references to other current stuff like distrust of government, fear of a medicine-resistant pandemic, and squabbling with other ex-bloc nations in the Russian embassy. And none of these themes is well integrated into the action--nor do the events themselves seem menacing or exciting enough to outweigh the skimpiness of the ideas.This is a clear example of what happens when a studio tests a movie on an audience, worries that it's too arty or subtle, and calls in a team of fixers. The result is a hack job that has good moments, but ends up not fully satisfying any audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Third time is definitely NOT a charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the second remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, this movie distinguishes itself by a complete lack of metaphor, some of the laziest storytelling you'll ever see, Nicole Kidman with the biggest breasts of her career and shows what happens when not very bright filmmakers run head first into the brick wall where their intelligence ends.It's the same basic story as the first two versions, though this time it's mixed together with a rip off of The Andromeda Strain. A space shuttle crashes back to Earth, contaminated with an intelligent virus that infects people and then takes them over when they sleep. In this version, you get infected when one of the converted either projectile vomits on you or pukes in something you drink. As the infection spreads through a city, a psychiatrist named Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman) and her best friend/love interest Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig) rush hither and yon to save Carol's son Oliver (Jackson Bond), who is somehow immune to the alien virus. I don't really need to describe any more of the plot to you because if you watch The Invasion, it will explain everything that happens in laboriously explicit detail. This is one of those films where every so often there's a scene where the characters sit around and tell each other (and the audience) exactly what's going on.The Invasion has absolutely no internal logic to it. The alien virus spreads with ridiculous speed solely because the script needs it to spread that quickly. The alien-possessed humans are emotionless, except for every time when the script needs them to show emotion. In a foot chase where converted people are after Carol and Oliver, in one moment they're dozens of feet behind and the next moment they're hundreds of feet behind, for no other reason than they the script needs that to happen. Characters show up places they have no business being, knowing things they have no reason to know and doing things they shouldn't be doing. This is the sort of film where a character can get a syringe full of adrenaline shot directly into their heart, and all it does is wake them up from a nap with absolutely no other effects at all.The original Invasion of the Body Snatchers is renowned as a metaphor for the anticommunist paranoia of the 1950s. The people who made this movie wouldn't know a metaphor if it bit them in the ass. The Invasion makes extremely simplistic allusions to the fear of a global pandemic, but none of that has anything to do with the whole "people losing their identity" concept that's at the heart of this tale. It also makes some hackneyed speechifying about the corruptibility of civilization, but all that leads to is a truly dumb scene where a bunch of people stand around and let themselves be shot. I know what I just described doesn't make any sense. It didn't make any sense in the movie, either.None of the acting in The Invasion is particularly wretched. And besides a couple of montages that appear to have been edited together by a hyperactive gibbon in the middle of a week long cocaine binge, the movie looks fine. There are even a handful of moments that manage to be vaguely suspenseful. But it's plain as the day is long that the only reason this movie was made is because somebody thought they could make money with yet another Hollywood remake. They were wrong. This film was a massive bomb at the box office, primarily because the ambition to do nothing but make money produced a shallow, stupid, plastic thing.Don't watch this movie. Watch the original from the 1950s or the first remake from the 1970s. If your video store doesn't have them, then stare at a piece of lint. That'll be better than viewing The Invasion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPOILERS: From Sporing to Snoring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whoever gave this movie rave ("delicious") reviews either must never have seen the original "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", or even the inferior remake...or must have fallen asleep and thought he/she had seen a much better movie. The only fright in this movie is seeing some goo spread over people like marmalade and seeing people spit what looks like phlegm on Kiddman's face. (And either one of those events describes raising small children.)A stinky remake where the plot is badly damaged as to become nonsensical. The original with its "pod people" was imminently clear and the effects (50 years ago) much more frightening than fake phlegm and marmalade. Other than wiping some goo off herself from time to time Kiddman shows no effects of being awake supposedly for days or of having been infected so badly that her skin is beginning to change. And you see people transforming, but into what and from what? Without the total replacement by plant people it makes no sense. The vast majority of the world is infected yet suddenly everyone is well and all's well that ends...well...not well. And they have the nerve to try to turn it into a morality play in the last few minutes.From roots to leaves, from sporing to snoring, this entire movie is incredibly boring (other than seeing Kiddman, of course, in much of her glory, especially in one scene thrown in to keep us men awake apparently). The only fear you should have of this film is of staying awake somehow and of the money you got rooked out of and time you've wasted if you watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved the 1970's version of "Invasion". It was creepy, psychologically scary and I have never forgotten that final scene. It takes a lot to scare me (dolls that come to life and Blair Witch) but "Invasion" was one of my very favorite scares. So I was excited to go see this remake. What a TERRIBLE movie! It starts out OK with people changing and weird things happening. The kids trick or treating was a great scene where the dog attacked the "changed kid" and the kid broke the dogs snout. But the last two thirds of the movie were ridiculous. Oh Nicole's characters son just happens to be immune. Give me a break. And the last ten minutes were completely insulting. A Hollywood ending to a classic story. I have never been so disappointed but unfortunately not surprised. If you loved the 1970's version, rent it and rewatch it and don't even bother to get this one on DVD when it comes out. IT IS TERRIBLE!!!</fullReview>

The ending was the absolute worst for me. I know the Studio pods tacked on an intro &amp; ending to the original, but you can just ignore those. To try to turn this particular premise into a so-called "happy ending" shows such contempt for the original it is untrue.Finally, why do all film titles have to be so short now?

		<fullReview>Its another alien invasion movie, and its a bad one. How many times can we see re-makes of "Invasion of the body snatchers"?!? We had the original in 1953, and a re-make 25 years later, in 1978. now 29 years later - they make another one. I guess we should prepare for another one in 2030... 97% of the movie describes the invasion, though the idea is quite well understood after 10 minutes. - then the whole problem is solved at the last 3 minutes like with a magic wand, and with minimal "heroic" action. True - it does have a more modern feel than the old ones, but its the same lame and chewed-up idea all over again, and badly done. Don't waste your time. Don't even waste time downloading it.

		<shortDescription>One To Enjoy With An Open Mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>.Having seen the 1978 remake of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" I really enjoyed the movie immensely. It was involving and very gritty and surely gave me nightmares for the next five days (that's how effective that movie was and still is to this day). When I walked into the premiere of this 2007 remake, "The Invasion" I pretended that I wasn't just walking into another adaptation, I walked in with a clean slate and open mind with the intentions of viewing some virus injecting excitement and I couldn't be satisfied more.Some of my friends dismissed "The Invasion" as an overrated zombie movie and to me that is the misnomer of all misnomers. This movie doesn't even come close to a typical zombie movie. We get people talking like they're in a daze, the perpetual stoic expressions and completely void of events that's happened before them. Never once do they make the effort to eat one's brains and are oblivious at first to who is or who isn't brainwashed. However, their unorthodox walking patterns is quite noteworthy and that they can survive without depending on nourishment and how they walk around with stoic on their faces just to infect victims who haven't been infected gives them that zombie thing going for them. In some ways these zombie-like beings are quite reminiscent to the zombies in Stephen King's novel "Cell: A Novel".Okay I'll be honest with you, the story seems a bit jilted at first. A UFO crashes on Earth and from the get-go, we already know that trouble is not too far behind and not just from a guy manifesting into a gooey substance in his bed. As the film progresses, we begin to notice that people were starting act anything but human-like. They have weird grins on their faces, have a creepy friendly demeanour in their personalities and they barf in your coffee. At first people get the feeling that a global epidemic is on the horizons, only to realize that something far more evil is lurking around than one might expect.The horror factor is that some alien bacterial infection is running rapidly on the world's population and nobody around knows where it's coming from. The infection moves from one individual to another almost identical to "28 Weeks Later" where they target their victims using bodily fluids which then the victims end up with a change in attitude which makes them very passive, aloof and their only initiative is to pass their fluids off to other unexpected victims and annihilate the immune. But what separates "The Invasion" from the other virus infected movies is that in most of them, war and utter chaos erupts and victims and non-victims are not safe from those catastrophes. In "The Invasion" it seems that war and anarchy has stopped in its tracks. The Americans have stopped fighting with the Iraqis, Israel and Palestine are now living in harmony and President Bush has a talk with late President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela. It seems that thanks to this virus, the world can finally live as one.With that in mind, this movie proves that this is anything but a brainless virus movie as we ask ourselves, should this manifestation be stopped or is this the poison from God to keep us from our aggression towards one another? Should we look for antidotes to bring us back to reality or should we just take it as it is? These are the little food for thought when watching this movie, but from the look at those who were effected you should be lucky you didn't become one of them. And sure it looks good to live in a peaceful serene setting of Earth, but in the end you realize that we're better off as violent tyrannical humans than peaceful, soulless individuals.The only flaw to "The Invasion" was that ending was too rushed and unexpected. Sure they had a good thing going for it, but they needed to further uplift the conclusion a little better. I mean it had a lot of good things going for it and before you know it, it just stops without a word of warning. But overall, I would have to say that "The Invasion" was quite intriguing. If you like horror movies you should check out "The Invasion" I think you'll have a ball with this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is such an underrated title! I loved the movie since the beginning. I would compare to 28 days later. It was just luck that I found this one as there is no propaganda of the movie. No one I know had heard of this movie but man, what a movie! I love the actors , I love the acting , everything! There is some darkness in the movie and there where some scenes that did scare me. Don't you like it when movies can induce different emotions in you? The idea that this series of events could actually happen in real life made the movie more appealing to me. We had something similar when the virus H1N1 came. The movie takes you right back to those moments of suspense. If you like those feelings don't let this movie unwatched!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was supposed to be a remake ... but only the main plot was taken, some spore from outer space, the contamination, the humans will win. We will survive. Anyway the screenplay is someway empty. The propagation of illness is very curious (during the REM sleep), it propagates externally on the skin and then vanishes. All contaminated people act together as guided by a very efficient and centralized hierarchical organization (very unrealistic, it is a spore not an army from Mars). When finally the way to the cure is found none is said about how the vaccine (or whatever) is obtained from the immune humans. Apart from the icily beautiful Nicole Kidman this movie does not give us anything really interesting to be watched. A remake should be done to update the plot and screenplay to our days, to add new filming techniques, to remove and correct any possible error made in the original movie. Nothing of this is successful with The Invasion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Craig and Kidman are always a draw, but even they can't elevate this stuff above mediocre. Unaware of the production troubles and coming to this film cold, I still felt it just doesn't get off the ground. The pod people aren't scary enough, Kidman's "I must find my kid" routine mimics her ex-husband's motivation in another sci-fi flop remake, War of the Worlds. In both films, the danger just does not seem immediate enough. And the alien life-force is defeated far too easily in the end, with no input from the protagonists (another similarity to the Tom Cruise flop). Re-making a fairly good film badly seems to show up the dearth of ideas in Hollywood at the moment. There really wasn't a better original script kicking about to attract this talent and financing?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This fourth adaptation about vintage novel deals a space shuttle blows up and the fragments transfer an alien virus that recodes the human beings DNA. It creates an altering the human behaviour. Meanwhile a psychiatrist named Carol(Nicole Kidman) must to protect her son(Bond) who may hold the means to avoid the extraterrestrial invasion. The mysterious epidemic from outer space is spread her friends, ex-husband and Washington people, everybody are being take over by emotionless,cold behaving. Carol is helped by her good friend Doctor Driscoll(Daniel Craig) and scientific Doctor Stephen(Jeffrey Wright).This scary Sci-Fi displays a tense screenplay based on Jack Finney novel titled ¨Body snatchers¨. Packs suspense,chills, thrills, spectacular car pursuits and pretty turns and twists. Good performances from Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig and Jeffrey Wright.Appears in secondary role Veronica Carwight as deranged wife, she acted in the second version by Philip Kauffman, besides cameo role by Jeff Wincott as a security agent,he's a B series star. The motion picture is professionally directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel, though with no originality. His greatest hits were ¨The experiment¨ and ¨The downfall¨.Another version about this known story are : the classic adaptation which emerged as a cinema classic directed by Donald Siegel(1956) with Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter, concerning about mysterious seeds duplicating people ; a magnificent semi-sequel which takes place in San Francisco directed by Phil Kauffman(78) with Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, and Leonard Nimoy; and inferior rendition by Abel Ferrara(1994) that takes place in a military base with Forrest Whitaker , Meg Tilly and Gabriella Anwar.</fullReview>

Can you imagine if something of this magnitude ever occurred here? The film had a creepy touch to it. The alleged action scenes were not overdrawn IMHO as many message board junkies were stating. What, was she not supposed to drive the car fast...? The ending (which I will not ruin here) was wise (considering my stress level).

		<shortDescription>Kidman Alone Brings The Movie From Below Mediocre To Above</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Invasion' is by no means a perfect film but I enjoyed it. Part of the reason is due to the company I was surrounded with (my family loves these kind of movies). It is very much a typical Hollywood sci-fi horror that 'pretends' to deal with themes like overuse of antidepressants and the desire for a 'perfect' world where all humans live in harmony blah blah blah. With such films one can almost always expect plot holes and overdone stunts and 'The Invasion' is no different. But, it does manage to create an intense alien atmosphere. The use of washed out colours to portray New York is well done and the camera-work is good. Nicole Kidman is superb. I don't understand all this criticism against her and accusations of her being a wooden actress. In my humble opinion, she is one of the finest actresses who even manages to lift a film like 'The Invasion'. In addition she looks absolutely stunning and healthy. I prefer this look than the extremely skinny look. Daniel Craig and Jeremy Northam are alright, though clearly overshadowed by Kidman. Thus to conclude, Nicole Kidman alone brings the movie from below mediocre to above average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I have written a comment on maybe 1 other movie, that just shows how little I would make the effort to come on here and type, but seriously, this is a ridiculous movie and it deserves to be bad-mouthed. The scenes in this movie that are supposed to establish parts of the story are far too short and lacking in depth and acting. Within the first 15 minutes of the film the story has large developments but nothing that leads into it, it just happens. Scene after scene jumping forward into the story without explanation or depth. I don't understand why an actor would pick this movie to be in, or at least agree to working with whoever produced/directed it. I wouldn't even rate this CLOSE to average, its insane that people could have watched the final cut of this movie and thought it was a well produced piece. I would have laughed incredily hard if someone screened something like that to me. To summarize, this movie reminds me of a TV show called Surface, and that's bad because Surface got cancelled, due to extreme crapiness.</fullReview>

Why would anyone not wonder why there boyfriend has not arrived after 8hrs from an infected city ? How lucky that she manages to have so many coincidences happen to her. Crap i don't know the mistakes are so many and so many plot holes you can actually get annoyed for having high hopes. Listen to me, If someone give this movie 8 9 or 10 THESE lot may possibly be working for the film studio.

There is hardly anything new in "The Invasion" - I had to put in serious effort not to remind myself of "Resident evil" and "Shaun of the dead". On a number of occasions I found there was a disconnect in the screenplay, later I read that it was re shot a couple of times, which explains ("too many cooks" syndrome, perhaps?). Nicole Kidman pouts the moment she faces the camera. Very wooden and extremely plastic at lot of places. Daniel Craig was ill-suited for the role of the doctor and plus chemistry with Nicole was lacking. The book might have been an interesting read, the movie clearly isn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is in no way worthy of the classic body snatchers plot used to make this film.Good dialog but a lot of weak scenes. I find it sad that film makers can slap together a script like this, spoil the production team with a huge budget, slap a big name like Kidman in it and see a huge return on their investment. It's pleasing the first time around when you rush out to see it in the theater but the long term quality of the product is disappointing because it's just not there.For one, sci fi flicks shouldn't thrive on drama and suspense. Sci Fi fans want creepy effects and ones done physically, not purely CGI. Replace the plot of this film with something like a genetic viral outbreak to turn the world into a super race of Nazis and they could have made the EXACT same film.Finally, since this is of course a popcorn flick for the lame of brain, there is a happy ending and everything is resolved. Another huge setback when it comes to remaining true to the classic plot.One time around I admit it's entertaining but repeat value leaves a bad taste in one's mouth. This is a pop culture yuppie flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Invasion of the zombie Hollywood execs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to be original when dealing with the zombie genre. However generic this film may be, it does play with the interesting premise that separation and conflict are a mark of our humanity. This idea is developed further, when we see the main character (Kidman) letting people die all around her, in order to protect herself and her son. We really start to question how far we'd go in such circumstances.Sadly though, this film then goes the same way as most Hollywood pap - it tries to please its audience instead of challenging them. Apparently screen test audiences need a story to be spoon-fed to them. Perhaps they are all on Ritalin, I don't know. So what we end with is a corny car chase, a chopper on the roof, "miracle boy" is whisked away to safety, and the world is saved. A few news flashes and the film abruptly ends. Poor Jeffrey Wright, who was so brilliant in "Basquiat", must have cringed at that script.So what I suggest is this. Watch the first half to two-thirds, and then fill in the rest with your imagination. Unless you've watched too much Hollywood pap, in which case your imagination may be severely impaired.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title of this film is pretty self explanatory: It deals with yet another invasion from outer space. This time though, the human race doesn't have to deal with huge space ships controlled by lizard-like creatures (Independence day) or with stupid looking tripods coming from underground (War of the worlds). In this particular occasion we are confronted with an alien virus that takes over our bodies. Now, viruses are part of our every day lives, which makes this story a bit more realistic than other alien movies: Anyone can get sick. You can't see who the real enemy is. Indeed, this is a rather smart thriller. It's a movie that makes you think and wonder about the human condition itself and how fragile we are as a society and as species in general. Kidman gives another solid performance as a psychiatrist (I wonder what her ex husband would think of this) whose world starts to shatter before her eyes.Nothing is what it seems anymore.She wants to protect her son against this invisible enemy. Kidman is able to translate her character's fears, frustrations and protectiveness in a realistic manner, without being over the top or a cliché like it often happens in this kind of films.She is not a hero: she is an anti-hero, which is rather refreshing to see on film.How far will we go to protect the ones we love? Can we go against our own principles?How far will anyone go to survive?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>does not deserve so much indifference</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This latest incarnation of the famous alien pod people invasion story has gone through so much misfortune that I consider it a miracle that it was even given a cinematic release. As a matter of fact that said release can be deemed a cover-up. The studio, as if ashamed of its treatment of the film during production has done nothing to promote it. Thus, as a fan of any science fiction movie and someone who has watched and enjoyed all three previous versions of the story, it was understandable why I was worried about it entering the local cinema last night. Now I can safely say that all the indifference and negativity is quite unfair. Nowadays people sadly tend to be prejudiced about films prior to their releases, getting affected by positive or negative hype. What I watched last night was pretty decent science-fiction if not ranking among the best of the genre.First of all, I liked the way the story has been updated for yet another installment. Abel Ferrera's update in 1993 kept the basic premise of people being replaced by alien pods during their sleep and with the support of nice special effects was highly effective. This new version completely drops the pods in favour of a virus that reprogrammes the human DNA to turn it into a lifeless and monotonic being, devoid of any features that define it as a separate human identity in the first place. Thus the story comes bang up to date, displaying all the anxieties of current global society as regards the genetic issues and controversies. All the scientific aspects of the story appeared believable and probable to me.By turning humans into monotonic beings, the alien virus actually manages the utopia of definite peace in the world. This was a nice and well-thought-of point of irony by the filmmakers and continued to resonate in my mind after the film ended. Is it better or worse for us to keep our personalities intact, with all our inherent genetical psychological defects included that create all those never-ending conflicts both at global and daily life basis? Nice philosophical aspects of the screenplay and a well-deserved 10 points to the film for that matter.Upon this ground base, the usual stages of the Body Snatchers story structure are ticked in an economical running time of 100 minutes, but with an added twist. Here the filmmakers try to do something different and tell the story in a very quick fashion. The viewer experiences the same sense of confusion as the heroine. She goes through her daily routine while the inhabitants of the city around her change abruptly during every passage of nighttime and sleep. The panic she feels after 3-4 days is very believable as a consequence. This sense of helplessness is further enhanced by a style of flash-forward editing structure utilised in some scenes. I found myself quite breathless during certain parts of the film as a result.The two high profile stars of the film give decent performances, with special mention going to Nicole Kidman. She reminded me of Hitchcockian heroines, appearing cold from outside but taking control of the situation if necessary. She is in my opinion the right casting choice since her perfect features and stiff posture blend wonderfully with the background of lifeless virus-influenced people during the mid section of the film, making her imitation tactics for survival believable. Also I liked the chemistry she had with both the child actor playing her son and Daniel Craig.The highly criticised ending was also satisfying to me. With the vaccine changing people back to their normal selves, the violence and war throughout the world continues as if nothing had happened. The alien phase is experienced as a blackout by the brain so humanity can safely go on in its routine of self destruction until the end of time. The doubtful look on the heroine's face at the last shot while the latest TV announcements about the killings in Iraq is heard in the background neatly wraps the story. No alien invasion can stop humans from being humans, for better or worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shouldn't of made it at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film "The Invasion" was nor good or bad, and as the second remake of the "Invasion Of The Body Snatchers" they could have made it better by not making it at all. The plot it's self is a bit different then the original and the first remake, first being that the main character is a woman and her child, whereas in the original and the first remake both the main characters where men with completely different professions. The second and biggest difference is that In each "Invasion Of The Body Snatchers" they made the Body Snatching process different. The first remake of the film the aliens duplicated the bodies using a weird plant thing that killed the original body so you couldn't reverse it. Unlike in the latest "The Invasion" where a organism takes over the bodies but not duplicate them, so reversible which I don't like.Then again in each "Invasion Of The Body Snatchers" it shows what people's worries were in those times, and at the moment it happens to be threatening organisms. maybe in another twenty or thirty years there might be another "Invasion Of The Body Snatchers" with the thing that we would be worried of then, and it would probably be called something different like Body Snatchers or some other abbreviated name.Obviously this film has some action which nearly all 21st century audiences are attracted to. If you really enjoyed "The Invasion" I do not recommend the first two "Invasion Of The Body Snatchers" but if you like the plot of the film more than unneeded action I do recommend these films.My opinion on this movie is that there is good acting and good directing but the story line could be improved. But I really think that films shouldn't be remade if they don't need to be remade, I think the first one was good anyway, I don't see why they had to remake it twice, yet this film might draw more younger audiences to the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>God, I just finished this film and cannot believe how unentertaining it really was. The change of directors and script, reshoots, and re-editing are extremely obvious, and make the movie more like two completely different genres trying to tell a similar story in one go. Starts off more interesting, then becomes a comic book-like action flick. Leaves so many holes, it makes your head spin... if you're still even really paying attention. It doesn't really even deserve to be picked apart because of how predictable it is, even if you never saw the original and have no idea it is a remake. What did amaze me enough to write something is how crazily thin and 'poreless' they made Nicole Kidman!! The constant "Moonlighting" effect, surgeries and Botox made her unbelievable as a human, much less a mother and doctor. Not to mention the size 00 and posture of someone who has never lived a real life. I found myself continuing watching just to see if we'd get one clear, unfiltered shot of her face!! I paused the movie for a moment close to the beginning, during a shot of just her from her chest up, and when I turned back to the TV to restart I joked, "Look, I bet she wasn't even there that day!" THAT'S how 'treated' she was!! I'll so sick of this!! Actors like Nicole Kidman and Al Pacino that have gotten to a point where all their characters are exactly the same... and all unbelievable. If I see one more Pacino movie with one of his 'speeches' or Kidman playing a mother concerned in some way for her child, I'll have to shoot something!!

		<shortDescription>Rethinking of the classic story removes many of the elements that makes the story so scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fourth film version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a misfire. Neither the disaster that most pre-release reviews made it out to be, nor the classic a (very) few post release reviews claimed, this is destined to get lost sometime soon. The problem with the film is that in rethinking the story it removed many of the elements that made it so scary. Here the virus is known about more or less from the get go as shuttle crash brings the "virus" (gone are the pods) to earth. The battle is that the virus now bringing an end to conflict, everyone is getting along...mostly. It seems that Nicole Kidman's son is immune and with him a vaccine can be made. Owing more to say Robert Heinlein's Puppet Masters and its 1990's film version (which I really like) this is a scifi movie of the been there done that variety. Sure there are some scares but the visceral punch is gone. The first version worked because of what it represented. Philip Kaufman's remake/sequel worked (possibly better) by taking the known form of the original and upping the ante in all the right spots. Abel Ferrara's army base set Body Snatchers worked (less well than the first two but still worked) because it spun the tale in new directions, and even covered similar ground as this one. If this version works at all, it's perhaps because of the craft, but its chills and thrills are empty and moments after a scare or shiver you realize that what frightened you makes no sense except in the unreal world on screen. For hard core fans of the stars or for those needing to see every scifi remake that comes down the pike only. All others are advised to avoid this waste of celluloid, until you're forced to see it on endless cable rotation. (Hey what did you expect from a film that sat so long on the shelf that new scenes featuring Daniel Craig were shot long before he was even cast as James Bond, thus allowing him to become, unintentionally, one of the big names in the cast).</fullReview>

Lackluster remake of the sci-fi chiller "The Invasion of The Body Snatchers" with an alien parasitic organism that hitches a ride on the Space Shuttle which crashes releasing it to an unsuspecting Washington, DC populace including psychiatrist Kidman who suddenly sees odd behavior in her patients and the slowly adding of 2 and 2 to the threat at hand. In spite of some state-of-the-art visuals which vary from cool to boring, the film suffers by not focusing more on the social strata than the geopolitical climate which its forbearers had the good insight to do just that. Kudos to having some insight to have Cartwright (from the vastly superior first remake in 1978) on board as one of Kidman's troubled patients; and yes it's true the Wachowski Brothers were hired to pump up the climactic chase sequence.

Neither the Storyline nor the Direction has anything to account for,except for being farcical. Their is no element of thriller nor horror nor mystery in this science fiction misfit.Overall, "The Invasion" is a mess.

		<shortDescription>A first rate intense science fiction thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the people in the world, who would have thought Nicole Kidman could play an action heroine? She has certainly proved her acting chops in just about every genre, but there is something too classy about her? Her icy, aristocratic personality gives her that isolated sense of royalty... and yet, it serves her so well here, as she must battle an entity that threatens with taking over the world.As the film opens, Kidman's character is making desperate attempts to stay awake, since falling sleep is the transitional period when the alien viruses begin to take over their victims' bodies. She frantically searches in a pharmacy for anything that can keep her going, and she is desperately trying to protect her child. It's a great introduction to a story that appears deceptively simple and can suffer from the remake syndrome perception or from the attitude of serious filmmakers who can't understand that every genre will only succeed if there is a great screenplay and very capable actors. Both of those elements are present here, as we see our actors portray varied emotions showing pain, despair, paranoia, anger, relief, etc. Kidman wanders around the city, looking for her child, and along the way she discovers that the new world is scary because people are being inducted and transformed against their will, and yet the end result is both terrifying and almost alluring.What makes this remake so special is the way the background has been expanded, giving us some scientific background about how the cells are affected by the invading organism, and there are also some issues that are raised about the possible side effects of the aliens' changes in the human body, mind, and attitude.This film has a very strong last third as tensions mount and Kidman must try to rendezvous with her rescuers. There are some very exciting thrilling moments, and moments that will chill the audience as we see what a desperate woman is capable of doing while protecting herself and her child. The ending is pretty strong, too, since we are giving a look at what the world we live really is like...Magnificent film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife rented this movie, but I love her so I forgive her. This is one of the two worst movies I have ever seen in my life. From the screenplay to the pseudo-science to the "acting" to the directing to the editing, the only movie that comes close to this abomination is Pitch Black, which is the only movie I've ever walked out on in the theater. This movie now has the distinction of being the only movie I've ever walked out of at home.Any student of film will either avoid this film or use it as an example of how not to make a movie. The movie abounds with jump cuts, continuity errors, and other no-nos that would make any editorial student gag.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strategy of the invaders: bore us to death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This uninspired remake of a classic sci-fi paranoia movie from almost five decades ago serves no purpose other than to invade your hard earned savings and cure chronic sleep deprivation.Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig were obviously bored too; they blandly drone out poorly written lines and wander around in a bewildered state (that goes for the supporting cast and extras, too). Many people actually appear to be yawning during this snore-fest; both the characters on the screen and the unfortunate souls in the seats tolerating this dismal affair.What kind of film were they using? Recycled? It makes early silent films look high-tech by comparison. The cinematography is browned out many times, and is just ugly to look at. People look like poorly designed CGI creatures making jerky, illogical movements. Cameras spin around in awkward gyrations in a desperate, lamentable, and failed attempt to instill audience involvement.Horror fans will be angry at the lack of scary scenes. Sci-Fi fans will be irritated at this mockery of the original "Body Snatchers." Mainstream audiences will find this script dimwitted and the acting a complete joke. The only group that might enjoy this are folks who like to laugh at lousy movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Deliciously Terrorifying and Compelling Remake of a Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I'm prejudice. Nicole Kidman is one of my favorite actresses. Second, I anticipated what might happen in this movie based on the original and subsequent first remake of this movie. After watching this movie, I couldn't really come up with any changes to the movie if I could. From the very beginning, in a fascinating use of flashback, Invasion throws the audience off balance with its thrown down in the middle of the movie scene. Because of the original movie, the fear element is heightened by what has gone on before. I cared about the mother and boy. And the director updated this movie tapping into not the 1950s communist scare and conformity element but skips any pretense and goes from the jugular, the literal heart of the matter - emotions make humanity, including its devastating horrors but also a much stronger focus on love and compassion than the original and sequel. The element of drama and mother-daughter bond is well captured her. The element of fear and tension, the use of having to hide and mask oneself in public. One of the best scenes, unique scenes is when mother and son must determine whether one of themselves have been transformed. There is a car chase scene has brings new meaning to cover-up. This along with "1408" are among the best horror movies to come along in years and among the best movie of the year. Nine out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie twice now, and I thought it was fairly entertaining both times. (Once again the IMDb score does not seem accurate, and it seems to be based on extraneous factors that have little to do with the movie itself.) I rather enjoyed the performance of Nicole Kidman. I also rather enjoyed the way this movie slowly reveals the gradual spread of the alien contagion, and what it says about our society. We are repelled by the "crazy lady" on the highway until Nicole Kidman turns into one herself."Alien possession" is a theme that has shown up so often in science fiction movies lately that it seems to be a separate subgenre.I think it started with Heinlein's 1951 book "The Puppet Masters". Back then alien possession was a metaphor for communism. Americans who adopted this political ideology were seen (by some Americans) as having been possessed in some way by an alien belief system. It's difficult for us now to understand how frightening this was.I'd like to know the psychological and social forces that have given rise to this more recent subgenre in Hollywood. Has anyone studied this? (I suppose the study of the rise of vampire movies has more priority.) Is it fair to write possession movies off simply as an offshoot of American religious extremism? What is the difference between religious possession (both good and bad) and alien possession (both good and bad)? Not much.As is the case in all these movies, the possessed are blown away with glee. In this movie, we are expected to cheer the boy attacking his own father. Why? "My father is no longer my father." In other words, you are my father, and you are a human being, only as long as you are, do and say the right things. Let's call it subjective relativism -- literally.This represents the demonization that occurs when relationships collapse, intimacy is lost, and alienation sets in. I don't like my husband anymore. Hell, I don't know my husband anymore. There must be something terribly wrong with him. It's him, but he's become a monster."My husband is no longer my husband." Well, that's something we're all going to tell ourselves at some point in our lives.</fullReview>

Seems a lot of folks really hate this movie. I don't know why. Don't care either, to tell the truth. I gave up giving the remotest damn about what haters hate years ago. Nicole is a hottie. Boy is she ever. Shapely, beautiful, and she loves her kid. I like to see that.. a woman who fights to save her kid. Too many movies are populated by worthless passive goons who won't defend themselves. Love the way she gunned down them stinkin' alienized zombies. Obviously the good doctor knows a thing or two about handling a firearm. Yay on that! Can't stand people who won't defend themselves and their loved ones. Really. And her kid got plenty of guts too. Imagine having to stick a needle in your mom's heart to get her going' again. Yikes! Double yikes! But he did it. A chip off the ol' block(ette)? SPOILER: Has a happy ending. I was worried it was going to be one of these "modern" flicks that sows dispair and leaves you depressed because the ending is bleak and awful. I hate those loser flicks. Really. What kind of entertainment is that?? Bottom line: me, I found this flick watchable.</fullReview>

The cast of this new version (can you imagine third remake!) is fantastic. Nicolle Kidman is amazing as is Daniel Craig, though I found him less convincing after he was changed. Jeremy Northam was great as scary dad.I always try and watch remakes without comparing it too much with the original. This was a good movie but didn't impress me too much. But if you DO compare it I found this one not so scary, I missed the horrible screaming of the "changed" persons". The original and first remake just do a better job. The fact that in this remake they suddenly find an antidote makes it an American movie that has to have a good ending. My feelings are mixed about this one.My movie is not my movie;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent, but arguably the least of the four</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Invasion," starring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig, is the fourth in the quasi-franchise based on Jack Finney's 1955 novel "The Body Snatchers" about an alien invasion where people die and their bodies become pod-versions of their former selves. The entries in the series are as follows:- "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (1956) - "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (1978) - "Body Snatchers" (1993) - "The Invasion" (2007)The first one is in Black &amp; White and is probably too dated and tame for most modern viewers, but it's still worthwhile; it takes place in small town, California. The 1978 sequel switches the setting to the big city of San Francisco. The 1993 sequel switches to an army base in the deep south. And this 2007 version switches back to the big city of Washington DC (shot in DC, Baltimore and Los Angeles).I prefer the 1993 film, followed by the original, and then the 1978 version and this one. What I like about "Body Snatchers" is the cast and the setting; the Army base naturally makes it easier for the alien imitations to go undetected. Unfortunately, "Body Snatchers" bombed at the box office and so did this one. Although I like Daniel Craig, I'm not big on Kidman; I can take her or, more likely, leave her. Those who are Kidman fans will appreciate this entry more than me. It's not bad; it's got some creepy moments and quite a bit of action, particularly car chases, but the story's too city-bound for my tastes and filmmakers take the safe route with the horror, unlike the other versions. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, though. Why should every film end on an ultra-downer note? I respect this different approach. The film runs 99 minutes.GRADE: C+</fullReview>

The politics is pretty unsubtle - coming from me that is saying something (it is difficult for me to get the message quite often but with this one it was definitely clear, I sat through Atlas Shrugged pt1 without really thinking for a second 'hey maybe they're trying to make a political point').

		<shortDescription>Highly infectious viral plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't show emotion, don't blink your eyes, walk like a zombie, and above all don't go to sleep -- or else you change into a simulacrum of your former self. Where have we heard this before? Well, it was a story in Collier's Magazine in the early 1950s. It was made into a superior low-budget science fiction movie by Don Siegel in 1956. Remade and up dated in the 1970s. Done again, with less panache, ten years later. Then Carpenter's remake is in here somewhere. And now, yet again, the permutations of the plot have been shuffled and here we go.This time, Dr. Binell is Nicole Kidman. It's from a woman's point of view, and she has a child that must be protected. See, women are more helpless than men, and children even more so, so that less effort needs to be put into the attempt to involve the audience in the protagonist's predicament.There is no mention of pods, though I kept thinking throughout of the victims as "pod people." This time, what appears to be "the flu" is "going around." One wonders where the flu "goes" when it's not going around. Some vast staging area in the sky probably. But, as the experienced viewer already knows after the first few minutes, this is a remake of "The Invasion of the Body Snatchers" and the problem has nothing to do with earthly pathogens. It's a large virus from outer space that goes to work in the human body when "hormones are released during REM sleep." (There are several inserts of gurgling blood streams and bursting spiked basketballs, just so we understand what's up.) The extraterrestrial virus does something to the skin before it morphs the victim too, so that we see one guy, half-morphed, who looks like a thousand-year-old freeze dried Peruvian mummy.The plot is nonsense but it hardly matters. The plot of the original was full of holes too, but Siegel did such a good job of conveying the small-town atmosphere of Santa Mira and the performers were so good at their jobs that the impression left at the end was that of a good fairy tale.This one is a bad fairy tale, tasteless, tawdry, cheapened in every way except in terms of budget and cast. There's nothing wrong with the cast. Nicole Kidman is expert at handling some challenging roles -- "To Die For" and "Eyes Wide Shut" come to mind -- but she has nothing to work with here. Basically, she runs and runs and runs, usually tugging her child by the hand, while pursued by gangs of zombified goons. There is no atmosphere to speak of, and less character.The direction is perfunctory and the script pandering. There are shoot outs, grotesque spastic semi-corpses, falls from skyscraper rooftops, transmission by means of vomit colored like spinach dip, multiple car chases, multiple car crashes, and gore galore. It borrows clichés from every action thriller you've ever seen, including a gratuitous hypodermic jab into the heart, from "Pulp Fiction." It raises, almost by accident, some interesting questions. In the background of all this hectic activity, we notice on TV that the world leaders have stopped bickering because, presumably, they've been infected with the virus. Kim Jong Il disbands his nuke project; the president turns Iraq over to the Iraqis; pharmacies give away vaccines for AIDS, and so on. Zombies have nothing to fight about or to covet, you understand. So, then, what's so bad about zombification? The original posed an interesting conflict between humanity, with all its flaws and virtues, including love, and a placid but will-less existence. Absent here. And is Kim Jong Il a pod person? Is George W. Bush? And, if the victims don't really care about anything, how do they reproduce? The film raises another interesting point. There's a virus going around, for sure, but it's a viral idea that spreads from production to production, first insidiously, then fulminatingly, leading to terminal Gargantuanosis. An idea, once proved to be commercially successful, invades the other Hollywood cells and forces them to replicate the DNA of the original until they finally pop and release still more viruses into the cinematic blood stream and before you know it, every new movie you see is a replica of an earlier one, whether this is acknowledged in the title or not. Yes -- "The Invasion" is the perfect title for this piece of brummagem garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Studio killed the atmospheric thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a shame to think what could have been, had the studio not wanted the film to be so commercial and therefore destroyed whatever Hirschbiegel hoped to achieve. It's clear that he had a great picture going, until they took over and crafted a final act that was almost unbearably predictable for such a unique and terrifying story. The first hour is incredible. The plot line itself is terrifying as humans are taken over by an alien being that makes them empty shells, striving for a perfect world without sin. The acting all around is pretty spectacular and nobody misses a mark by showing any emotion when it's not required.Nicole Kidman stars as Carol Bennell a woman who notices the strange things happening around her, but the government's decision to keep everything quiet and publicize this alien invasion as a simple flu leads to her not realizing what's happening until it's too late. Now, with the help of her doctor best friend Ben (Daniel Craig) she has to go and find her son (Jackson Bond) and get out of the city before they are taken over. Luckily for her, her son is also immune to the virus meaning he may also hold the means for a cure. So the race is on to find him, and Carol must pretend to have no emotion in order to trick these body snatchers. I've never been a fan of Nicole Kidman, but I must say that her performance impressed me here.Up to this point, the film is a knockout and was looking to become one of the best of the year and something that I couldn't really understand why everyone hated so much. But then she finds her son, and that's when the obvious studio takeover occurs. The rest of the film features horrendously predictable plot points and an ending that is just jaw-droppingly unreal, with some very out of place action scenes and a car chase that is laughably ridiculous. It's a shame that something so promising could turn into such a mediocre commercial thriller. Hirschbiegel also sets up some political commentaries on how the American government reacts to epidemics and how flawed this is, but that's thrown out the door as well when everything turns into explosions and fast cars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great commentary on what makes us human.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John McEvoy Feature Movie Review: "The Invasion"The timeless beauty of Nicole Kidman graces the screen again in the latest and greatest film adaptation of the 1955 novel "Invasion of the Body Snatchers," by Jack Finney. Just as the previous three body snatcher films preyed on society's deep rooted emotions through the fears of the time, this film touches on our contemporary fear of infection. It also makes a powerful statement about what makes us human. Throughout the film, the viewer is kept abreast of what is happening in the news headlines: "Three American soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb in Iraq." "Border war prolongs Darfur's misery." The most compelling news in the beginning of the film is the destruction of the space shuttle "Patriot," which blows up in a spectacular fireball during re-entry. Lurking in this scattered debris are spores able to survive the bitter cold of space and the heat of re-entering earth's atmosphere. Once inside the host, these microbes change human DNA during REM sleep and turn victims into passive automatons of one sinister mind. This is a much more believable scenario than the previous films where alien seed pods duplicate the bodies of the host and then assume their identity after murdering the still sleeping human. One of the earliest infected is Kidman's ex-husband, who coincidentally is one of the directors at the Center for Disease Control. Through his powerful position he orchestrates a massive inoculation for what is being reported as a dangerous strain of the flu. Within a few days, changes are becoming obvious as more and more people transition from emotional human beings to apathetic aliens. The news declares: "Bush and Chavez reach an agreement of cooperation," and "The Janjaweed have agreed to lay down their arms." Peace is breaking out all over the planet. Also entirely too coincidental, Kidman's son Oliver is immune to the alien threat because of his contraction of small-pox as a child. This is not discovered however, until after Oliver has been dropped off at his father's for a visit and before Kidman suspects her former husband is a part of the plot. What follows is a suspenseful and dangerous quest to rescue her son and then a heart pounding, edge-of-the-seat ride to escape the city infested with insidious aliens. Unlike previous versions of the Finney novel where one is left in a world full of aliens and no chance of remaining human, this movie ends with a sense of triumph over evil. After killing a few aliens along the way, Kidman recovers her son and gets him out of the city and to a place where people are still people. Using her son's blood, a vaccine is created and the world is saved. Although this movie was a box-office disaster, it is an enjoyable, 90-minute escape from reality. Or is it? News flash! "Today there were 83 more deaths in Iraq." "North Korea threatens to stop dismantling its nuclear reactor." When asked by a reporter if the alien virus had been eradicated, an official replied, "Pick up a newspaper. For better or worse, we are human again."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know when capitalism goes bad at the movies, because the producers forget to conceal that viewers are really just consumers. The first half of this movie is average, and then the second half arrives, heavily bandaged, and relying on convention so much that it just becomes dumber and dumber until it falls to pieces. The more convention reigns, the less specificity you get, and the less satisfying everything becomes - and the more you ask, why did they think this remake was necessary? Sadly, convention is what makes nervous industry execs relax and open their checkbooks. This movie makes us spend a lot of time in alleys, parking garages, and cinder block service-halls. I guess they saved a ton on sets. But as I was popping in my next movie, I was thinking, "Did I really just watch a movie whose climactic scene involves waiting around a convenience store?" Everyone wears gray and black after they go pod. No one with an ugly coat or bad hair, no pre-teens in slutty clothes. Everyone looks like they work at a creative agency. The town at the end is supposed to be D.C. or Baltimore (I lost track), but it's clearly L.A.. It's all unspecific and interchangeable. Prior to the invasion Kidman isn't exactly lively. She whispers all her lines, so very little difference registers when she needs to become chilly to blend in. Another problem lies exactly where it should have been anticipated; the more people become pods, the less emotional range the actors can show. But here they're all haughtiness, peevishness &amp; resentment. The more emotion they show, the LESS scary they are. Poor Jeremy Northan has just one scene before he's off to pod land. It takes a lot of work to make Craig look unattractive but they succeed here.The reconception of the pod outbreak as an infectious cycle results in a movie that behaves more like the zombie flick, 28 Days Later. Of all the reproductive methods shown in the invasion movies, I was fine with giant quivering gummi-bears, slimy pupas, tentacles snaking up people's nostrils, but puking into the beverages of unsuspecting victims is just grotesque. There are two thoroughly nasty shots of wait-staff bending over a service table, hocking into coffee pots (in plain view) which are so over the top they'd be comical if the movie was a subversive riff on how oblivious the population is. No such luck. It's merely disgusting. The shots are as absurd as anything in Buckaroo Banzai, another movie where aliens hock things up out of their throats. Maybe the next remake should be a comedy. It might have been a beautiful send-up of Scientology. Kidman's movies have had enormous problems lately; this movie, The Stepford Wives, and I'm going out on a limb (because I haven't seen it) Bewitched. Twice now she has had to return to the studio to shame-facedly reshoot inept, revised finales. The end here, which reverses everything, is in every way the equal of the nonsensical conclusion that was duct-taped onto her rotten Stepford Wives remake.It must be a grim moment after a dud preview, and after you've brought in the Wachowski Bros to spice things up (and John McTiegue to pinch-hit) that you realize nothing can rescue your movie. I'm guessing this occurred during the late night shoot of a careening car piled high with evil pod businessmen in a failed effort to portray something thrilling. In the ridiculous 'making of' feature, the crew is as dumb as modern culture allows. They're still pushing the idea that the first movie was about Communism, when Siegel has continually asserted that it was ridiculing suburbia. The Communism &amp; McCarthism allegories, fascinating though they are, came later. Keep your eyes peeled for a ridiculous starstruck physician (Marc Siegel) and a Homeland Security Researcher (Terry O'Sullivan) who must be pretty desperate to appear as talking heads, and take a paycheck for badger viewers about a crap sci-fi movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only pleasure from watching this movie is a smug "I-knew-it-was-crap" aftertaste; still, it's a Pyrrhic victory after wasting two hours of your life with this insipid mediocrity.There are three previous Invasion of the Body Snatchers films that I know of, and this is by far the worst of the bunch: it lacks the creativity of the Siegel version, the memorable ending of the Kauffman remake and the creepiness of Ferrara's. Plus, it lacks a defining chilling moment - although the thought this script was approved is pretty scary in its own right.You don't really need me to give you the plot, do you? Alien organisms, people start to change, "my husband is not himself!", and yadda yadda yadda. I am a Nicole Kidman fan, but she could give this kind of performance in her sleep. Daniel Craig looks somewhat constipated, with the awkward, tired expression of a python which has just swallowed too big a prey. It doesn't help many actors playing the infected humans are dreadful, with the predictable "robotic pantomime, cold glance" shtick.Like an incompetent magician, the movie shows its tricks too soon. In the others Invasion movies the most unsettling part was the setup, the growing realization of an unspeakable horror. Here characters understand everything at once and are remarkably calm about it: "Oh, it's a virus from outer space which changes people's personalities" claims a scientist without raising an eyebrow.The only element of some interest is the moral dilemma the main character seems to face at a certain point - what's better, our normal existence or a world without freedom but also devoid of violence and fear? Of course the dilemma is quickly forgotten in favour of a perfunctory car chase. Oh, and there's a scene in which Kidman finally falls asleep (I can't blame her - I was tempted to do the same) and her ten-year-old son gives her an injection in the heart to save her. Huh-huh, sure.What Invasion lacks is tension, depth, good character development, interesting dialogues and, in brief, a reason to exist. Apart for that, it's okay.4/10</fullReview>

It makes Michael Bay films look slow and patient. Any attempt to set an atmosphere and mood is inevitably wrecked by the jarring cuts, overbearing music, and forced action scenes. It's partly due to the reshoots, but I get the sense that the original film wouldn't have been much better. Kidman does her best, but she obviously doesn't believe what she's doing, and no one else is notable. And the way too sunny ending not only doesn't fit into the film, but it completely ruins the spirit of the story as it's been done before. As said, some of the sociopolitical stuff works, but that's about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Invasion did have the ingredients to be good, but sadly not only as a remake but also as a film it falls well short. Its main merit is that it is well made, the cinematography is quite striking as is the lighting, the editing is okay-ish if rather too jittery in places and the special effects are also pretty good.However, everything else fails. The cast are great on paper but when it comes to other assets they are wasted on screen. Nicole Kidman is a very good actress when she has a good role and script, but she has neither here and she offers very little other than look pretty and give forced facial expressions and dialogue delivery. Daniel Craig is certainly a charismatic actor, seen with Casino Royale the previous year, but when it comes to his dialogue and his bland delivery that is another story. Oliver Hirschbiegel is a talented director, but his direction here is lethargic and lacks any substance.The worst asset of The Invasion is the script which is just dreadful, with lines that are toe-curlingly bad, are cheesy and further slow down the movie. But that's not all. The story is very threadbare, even with trying new ideas. It tries to have some science-fiction elements, some mystery elements and some thriller elements but The Invasion fails at all of them because there is no or little suspense or thrills to be had here with a last act that is severely lacking in any atmosphere or tension. And the less said about some of the logical lapses here, the better.I think the pace can be blamed as well. A vast majority of it moves very slowly which makes The Invasion a tedious watch considering how banal the plot and dialogue are. But in the process there are some plot elements that are rushed especially the boy being attacked by a dog which is so rushed you feel no terror whatsoever and the idea of the alien virus which the script foolishly skims over. Also any scenes that do try to be suspenseful and the like are ruined by the lack of emotion, such as the alien-possessed humans idea. And then the metaphorical elements that made the wonderful original and its worthy first remake are either lacking or omitted.All in all, not the worst remake out there but a very poor one and the worst and most soulless of the three films. To say that third time is not the charm in my mind is being too kind. 2/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>very weak and unconvincing movie, the plot is flat and you've seen it in a number of other movies. complete lack of novelty. This isn't getting any better because of the superficial attempts to dress this plot in what should be "plausible" explanation. Any attempt for realism is ruined by what is supposed to look like science. It is not. what we have here are stereotypes, coming from earlier movies. not a touch of reality. live 3D images from EM (electron microscope), well that is just as possible as Skype chat over 19th century telegraph. don't want to bother with the rest. its hopeless...waste your time with this movie only if you don't have anything better to do.</fullReview>

How many times can we see re-makes of "Invasion of the body snatchers"?!? We had the original in 1953, and a re-make 25 years later, in 1978. now 29 years later - they make another one. I guess we should prepare for another one in 2030... 97% of the movie describes the invasion, though the idea is quite well understood after 10 minutes. - then the whole problem is solved at the last 3 minutes like with a magic wand, and with minimal "heroic" action. True - it does have a more modern feel than the old ones, but its the same lame and chewed-up idea all over again, and badly done. Don't waste your time. Don't even waste time downloading it. It's that bad. get a Nicole Kidman poster instead"Just for the record, this is the Forth remake - one was made in the nineties to with the dumb actress from night of the living dead remake.

		<fullReview>There's genuine acting talent in this movie (even the child actors are not too annoying) and a standard sci-fi horror plot which is not too bad.Unfortunately the finished article is less than the sum of its parts.This movie needed to invoke that feeling of dread and creeping paranoia as the events unfold, but it never reaches that level of suspense.Kidman has difficulty delivering characters you care about and Craig's "Britishness" just seems odd in this setting. You end up indifferent to their plight.The ending is far too convenient, almost as if everybody involved realized the film was a turkey and wanted to get it over with asap.Shame because there is not enough good sci-fi out there at the moment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful, Often Frightening Incarnation Of A Classic Sci-Fi Story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Invasion" is about psychiatrist Carol Benell (Nicole Kidman), an intelligent single-mother with one young son living in Washington DC. After a series of bizarre incidents, a sort of alien epidemic emerges and spreads throughout the city, and soon the entire United States - a strange virus which takes effect after one falls asleep, turning them into a mindless drone void of any emotion. After Carol becomes infected herself and her son is kidnapped by his biological father, she and her colleague/boyfriend Ben (Daniel Craig) must fight to save themselves from the already-infected, tricking them by showing absolutely no emotion, all the while attempting to find some sort of cure - without falling asleep.To be frank, I really, really enjoyed this movie. I have not seen any of the previous incarnations of the "Body Snatcher" story, so I know that I cannot make any comparisons. But based on what I witnessed in this movie, I thought it was an excellent film. From what I've heard, the original "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" and the 1978 remake of that film are the best incarnations of this story, and I really cannot understand why so many people despised this movie. My only explanation would be that it's simply because they have seen the other versions and I haven't. Nonetheless, I thought this was a great flick.Plot-wise, I like mostly everything about it. The story is original (despite it being a remake/ re-vamp of a novel) and the script here was well-written. The characters are believable and realistic, and there are some extremely scary, well-thought-out situations that abound. Thrown into the mix are some obvious commentaries on politics and the current state of humanity, which are interesting, depending upon your point of view I suppose. But the overall film toys with the idea of a worldwide pandemic, something that is easily frightening to many people - and something that could mean the end of humankind as we know it, and that's a scary concept to nearly anybody with an imagination.I also admired how the movie managed to blend science fiction and horror elements and be ultimately effective. The hybrid here works well - there's plenty of horrific moments and some genuinely scary scenes, and there is plenty of scientific themes (including the viral infection, its side effects, and the alien pandemic itself) that keep it well balanced out. We also get some sufficient action scenes and some neat set-ups. The suspense is strong and the tension solid throughout. Nicole Kidman shines as our female heroine in a rather versatile role, and Daniel Craig plays her male counterpart well. Also notable is Veronica Cartwright (who starred in Hitchcock's "The Birds" as a child), playing a patient of Kidman's. The film does kind of go out with a whimper, but besides that I enjoyed everything else.Overall, I felt "The Invasion" was an intriguing and thrilling sci-fi horror picture. Regardless if it is a remake, it is a suspenseful and entertaining roller-coaster ride with plenty of thrills and chills along the way, with some neat themes thrown into the mix and some solid performances. If you're a fan of science fiction thrillers with apocalyptic, hysteria-laced themes, I'd strongly recommend this. I really don't understand the harsh reviews on this site, because I thought this was far above the standard horror/thriller fare. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just when I was tiring of Nicole...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it's good I read so many negative reviews before seeing The Invasion. It doesn't hurt two of my favorite actors, Jeremy Northam and Nicole Kidman, are in the film (Northam should have been the male lead), but since The Hours I haven't been that wild about any of her performances. Northam could read a phone book and keep one enthralled. Kidman gives a fresh and credible performance as the mother desperately trying to save her son from aliens who claim they have the answer to humanity's problems but want to kill the boy because he's genetically unable to become one of them. Anyone get the not-so-subtle irony? I'm a big fan of the original '56 version and '78 re-make but not one made in the 90s (with one of the Tilly sisters and... someone else). I wouldn't expect anyone to try to match either for the incredible tension and real scares each still creates in its own way (the '78 version was as close as one might get to the original and a 3rd close remake would have been too close). This version's special effects are, to me, the best since the pods in '56 just look silly and even in the '78 version the transformation still looked pretty fake. The transformation scenes are creepy, especially at the beginning when Northam appears cocooned in his sleep. The movie jumps about in time right from the start so one is unsure if, for instance, Northam's nocturnal metamorphosis is real or imaginary until a few scenes later, in which he's clearly one of the pod people.There are direct references to both previous films, such as retention of the lead character's name ('56 and '78) and occupation as a doctor ('56), and both love interests in the '56 and 2007 version are named Driscoll, and the Bel(l)icecs play much the same roles in all three versions. Best of all Veronica Cartwright (Nancy Bellicec in the '78 film) plays a patient of Kidman's who is also immune to the alien super-virus and apparently survives in both versions (well, in '78's finale it's unclear if she escapes Donald Sutherland's horrific pod person squeal to identify an extant human and in 2007 the viral pod peeps may off her as they want to kill the immune kid too...). There are two scenes in which terrified humans are trying to get cars driving by to stop but are ignored, also homages to both previous films. Too bad they couldn't get 90+ year old Kevin McCarthy to reprise his car-stopping cameo from the '78 version.The 2007 movie is more subtly menacing and tension builds more slowly. While it's true there are no major scary scenes there are a few good jolts, such as when the chrysalis-pod person, in deep sleep, is jolted awake by a camera flash and dies due to the interruption. I also liked the ant-like sacrifice made by two people who jump from a building to their deaths, eliciting screams from some who are quickly descended upon (but just realized the jumping couple kiss before jumping, so they aren't pods... just inadvertent helpers). The drone-like actions of the 2007 pod people, who are often standing in seemingly idle but somewhat well-formed groups, are subtle and not as overtly menacing as the groups in the '78 film. As she's escaping from pod people she gets on a sparsely filled subway train, where the essential secret for human survival in all 3 films, "Don't show any emotion" is revealed to Kidman by another passenger.The idea of sleep as catalyst of change involves only the REM stage, which explains why Kidman can fall asleep for a few minutes without being consumed. It's also an interesting twist because our bodies do undergo biochemical changes during sleep. The idea of REM sleep as trigger for the transformation is as credible as HIV attacking the very immune cells meant to destroy it, another elaborate cellular joke at the expense of human lives. The resolution also seems logical if a bit far-fetched, allowing those infected and changed to revert to their former genetic make-up and become human again.The ending of the movie is actually closest to the end of the novel by Jack Finney upon which all three are based, but it's a little provocative and ambiguous as well. The world is cured and "back to normal," with 86 killed in Iraq on that particular day. The words of a Russian diplomat (whose transformation is the most graphic and startling) echo in Nicole's head at the end, posing the question the aliens may have been right in one sense. In their inhuman world there are no wars, no murders, no hatred, just a large colony of creatures who coexist, a utopian ideal if they could retain that which makes them human. This wasn't a really great movie but it was good (and if Jeremy Northam had the larger male role it would probably have been much better...). It stands on its own as one of the better movies in the genre and more than enough is adopted/adapted from the earlier two films to satisfy its definition as a remake.My biggest complaint is Kidman says "KLO ZE PAM" two or three times when the drug she's referring to is "KLO NAZ E PAM (i.e., clonazepam)" but the director or script-reader should have caught that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good little sci-fi flick that isn't spectacular but not a disaster either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading several other reviews on IMDb I came to the conclusion that many regular film goers saw the same thing in The Invasion that I did...it was okay period. It was a good flick, entertaining, worthwhile and by the time you get out to the car you're thinking about what's on TV later that night...it doesn't stick with you. It has no especially powerful moments or performances, but while you're watching it you're not disappointed. Critics trash talked the film like it was the worst thing of the year and it's not by a long shot. In fact it's a fun night at the movies without having to think about why something is going on. If you think too hard about The Invasion then yes you'll walk out hating it. The film is wrought with plot holes and even a bit of a non-conforming time line made even more confusing by an unnecessary jumble of chronological plot points. Flash backs and flash forwards and things that don't help the story and stick out like crazy. They also seem to rush through several things to make sure they get to the main story and tie it up in a neat little 2 hour window (or a little less.) Everything with The Invasion seems to happen so quickly and you're trying to keep up but then once you get to the heart of the film it keeps you riveted to your seat.Nicole Kidman is a terrific actress, and very versatile and she has done her share of playing the 'scream queen' type role having performed in other thriller/horrors such as the superb "The Others" and "Dead Calm" and she definitely has this ability. She is beautiful and almost too exotic looking to play a down to earth type person but you do become enthralled in her adventure against these zombie type beings. Daniel Craig is terrific as her best friend/boyfriend Ben Driscoll. He almost seemed like he purposely holding back a better performance to not overshadow Kidman but the script for both of them was pretty weak. The two of them together make a great team given a better story. Young newcomer Jackson Bond really holds his own with Craig and Kidman as Kidman's son Oliver. He has a lot of screen time and really does a terrific job and I'm sure he'll be an up and coming star. Jeremy Northam is Kidman's ex-husband who is one of the first to be infected being a CDC (Center for Disease Control) agent. I would say that his performance is a little bland but that seems like an ironic statement given that he is supposed to be an emotionless zombie like alien but it didn't really impress me and he was forgettable compared to the other cast members.The film has great potential (obviously being a remake of a classic.) I have not seen the original film nor it's 2nd remake but I would like to in hopes that it might fill in some of the gaps sadly left by this installment. It seemed like they rushed to get to what they thought they could really sink their teeth into. The eerie world where everyone is being converted and the normal are forced to act without emotion should be a lot more powerful but it loses something...I just don't know what. The disease spreads very quickly and the heroes (Craig and Kidman) just seem to catch on to and accept what's going on far too fast. Basically it could have been dragged out over a trilogy (not that I would recommended that for this film.) Still sci-fi fans might get a kick out of this latest remake and even a movie goer won't be disappointed but it won't likely make any of your top ten lists this year or ever. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you haven't seen the 1956 original, this isn't bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie season should be called "The Summer of our Re-makes." First we had "Disturbia," whose creators--uh--rip-off artists--didn't even have the decency to acknowledge, in the movie credits, that they stole the plot from Alfred Hitchcok's "Rear Window," or that the screenplay was based on the short story by Cornell Woolrich. Soon, we're going to have "3:10 to Yuma" with Christian Bale and Russell Crowe. The original starred Glen Ford and Van Heflin. Also, coming along is a Jodie Foster project, "The Brave One." The plot is as follows: Woman's boyfriend is murdered--woman buys gun--woman is confronted by a robber--woman shoots robber--woman begins a spree of shooting a whole bunch of low-lifes. Hmm. . . Hmm. . . Hmm. . . this sounds awfully like "Death Wish" with Charles Bronson! By the way, one of Jodie Foster's last movies, "Flightplan," is also a direct rip-off of Alfred Hitchcock's "The Lady Vanishes." So, now we have the (at least) 3rd re-make of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." The first re-make was with Donald Sutherland and Leonard Nimoy, another ("Body Snatchers") featured Gabrielle Anwar, Forrest Whitaker and Meg Tilly, and now we have this one, and, I'm not positive, but I think there's another version around, too. Now, the original is one of the greatest Sci-Fi/Suspense/Horror movies ever made. Directed by Don Siegel, a director who also influenced Clint Eastwood's work, it holds up as well today as when it was first released, and I would suggest obtaining the DVD, finding as big a screen as possible (preferably one with a front projection system), getting the snacks, turning off the lights, and then setting back to watch a movie that amply demonstrates the art of superb movie-making.However, this newest offering is not bad. Yes, if you want to compare it with the original, it is inferior to that. But, if you've not seen the original, you will find it scary and suspenseful, unless your idea of scary is someone drilling a hole through some kidnapped woman's fingernail. If that's the case, then you should be in counseling, anyway.I say it's not bad for two reasons: (1) I thought it was going to be horrible because of the buzz I'd heard about it, but I found that it had a good amount of suspense built into it. In other words, my original negative mindset was dispelled by the story; (2) I observed the audience, and they seemed to be totally engrossed in the film. Therefore, I objectively assume others would enjoy it, too.Now, it does have flaws. The main one is that it becomes laughable when it decides to play a strange form of politics with actual current events. It's primary message seems to be that people who exhibit emotions such as love, hate, greed, selfishness, humility, etc., (i.e., us, we the people)are the problem. Why, if it weren't for us, we'd live in a perfect world. Shoot, if people would just submit to the inevitable rightness of the aliens way of life, then they would find that hunger, poverty, greed, the war in Iraq and all sorts of undesirable things would no longer exist. Okay, isn't that sort of like what Adolph Hitler was telling the German people as he began his conquest for world domination? Follow me and I'll be your savior? Anyway, I don't go to movies to hear lectures about the filmmakers political leanings. If I wanted to do that, I'd pay money to listen to Al Gore and Michael Moore lie to me some more.The car scenes are so blurred, you can't really see what is happening, and the aliens transmit their virus by spitting green stuff in your mouth.Three trivia notes: Controversial director Sam Peckinpah appears in a brief acting part in the 1956 version.In the "Loony Tunes Back in Action" movie with Brandon Fraser, there is a brief scene in which Kevin McCarthy (star of the original "Invasion") is seen carrying one of the infamous pods that brought him film immortality.Finally, have you ever noticed that Daniel Craig's upper lip doesn't move?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By now you know the obvious, that this is a failed remake of a remarkable film. You can read from others about the cinematic properties it lacks, the imprecision, the failed pace, lack of urgent focus... Its really bad. Films like this are their own sort of virus. What I'd like to remark on is the lack of subtext. I'm not sure one needs such a thing in horror films of this conspiracy-invasion kind. But the original had it and it gave it great power. The context was the cold war and the suspicion that there were silent, secret sleeper cells. That what this (the cold war) was all about was some grand battle between good and evil, but that evil often had persuasion on its side. The "convinced" were effectively brainwashed and thus behaved like zombies.We use things like this today. I saw a zombie movie (the one with the shopping mall) that clearly conflated Muslim extremists with the zombies, and the recent "Cloverfield" deliberately evoked 9-11.I'm not sure how one would convey that today with this film and stick close to the original idea. This business of "don't go to sleep." The notion that ADD kids are the salvation of society, somehow the root of what it means to be American. The subtext that psychiatrists matter. The idea that a lowly technician in a local hospital could mobilize and lead a worldwide response. The massive amount of explanation we suffer, particularly at the end.Kidman has had better days. It has a troubled production history with rewrites and massive reshoots. It shows.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Invasion" is a film about a Washington psychiatrist who unearths the origin of an alien epidemic, she also discovers her son might be the only way it can be stopped and it appears to be another adaptation of the classic "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" book.The film starts when a space shuttle lands on earth launching the movie into a fast paced (however sometimes nauseating) thrill ride and assumes that the audience already know what is going after the fourth installment of the franchise, however even if someone has never seen the earlier installments it is very easy for someone to pick up on the story and the plot. Saying that the plot and dilenma of the story is explained very well, it just doesn't really go into detail about the virus and only really deals with the emotional side of the story and character development.The emotional story of the film is possibly the strongest factor in the film because it shows Carol Bennell, played by Nicole Kidman (Moulin Rouge, The Others, Fur) slowly start to crack as events go on. The reason why this is so superb is because Kidman gives on of her best performances in recent years and maybe of her career; she gives unbelievable depth and character to her role and to add to that plays up her role best when she is with her on screen son Oliver played by Jackson Bond, who also gives a solid and interesting performance. Daniel Craig (Casino Royale, Munich) and Jeremy Northam (Wuthering Heights, The Tudors) have smaller roles however they give good solid performances, even though a little uninspiring.The Music in the film, composed by John Ottman is breathtakingly suspenseful and is a strong point of the film leaving the audience wrapped in suspense with the acting yet also with the music. This is the same with the editing which is no-nonsense and quick, however the editing can sometimes be confusing as at numerous points through the film, clips of the past and future are shown sometimes disorientating the audience and leaving them wondering what just happened.Aside from a the good points of the film, there is one thing that really stood out in the film, the re-shoots and that isn't a very good thing, the re-shoots stand out from the rest of the film and the end, well the end just doesn't go with the start of the film and the last ten minutes nearly ruined the film for me. With ten minutes to go the film is still a sophisticated Thriller, yet after that it turns into some mad action flick, however that is not director Oliver Hirschbiegel's fault as Warner Brother's pushed him aside to re-direct what they thought audiences would like.Overall this film is a sophisticated and enjoyable thriller with excellent performances (mainly from Kidman and Bond), yet the ending and a few other scenes totally flawed by re-shoots nearly ruin the film, who knows, maybe one day we will see a true Directors cut of what Hirschbiegel truly wanted in this film, but until then we still have this enjoyable, solid thriller, which is an OK adaptation of "The Invasion of the Body Snatchers" by Jack Finney. "The Invasion" is however a great film, but you can't help but wonder what levels this film would excel in if the studio had left it alone.4 stars out of 5</fullReview>

And the don't show emotion thing that was ridiculous, I mean it didn't even look scary it was more of boring effects. As I said before the only redeeming part was the part the studio made them reshoot.All in all the acting was fair, the editing was good but the story lacks on so many levels.

		<fullReview>Mindful of Daniel Craig's fine performance in "Casino Royale" and Nicole Kidman's in "The Hours", I thought "The Invasion" might have some interest even though it was panned by the critics. Wrong. It started quite well with its picturesque setting in Washington, DC and good photography. It progressively got worse, leaving the last half of the movie a tedious mess of noisy car chases, fiery crashes, violent beatings or shootings and mucus-covered zombies. Kidman and Craig exchanged tiresome clichés and mother-kiddie emotive syrup was poured over the ever-worsening script. There were only five people in the entire cinema on the 2nd day after opening - how come others knew to stay away? It pains me to think our ticket prices helped pay for Kidman's massive $15m or so salary for this truly dreadful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Civilization is an illusion, a game of pretend?The Invasion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why do Hollywood producers set their sights on a talented European director, get them to film one of their scripts, and then subsequently throw it away while hiring one of their own to helm reshoots and change the entire movie? First you dump all your cash on an artistic vision and then you grow scared that the public won't get it and therefore won't pay to see it. So, here is a smart move, lets spend even more money to redo what you just paid for and make a piece of trash that people really won't go and see. You'd probably end up making more profits by just releasing what you think is a failure rather than drain the bank even drier. Unfortunately for Oliver Hirschbiegel, director of the Oscar nominated Downfall, this is exactly the case. Credit him for being civil and saying that the Wachowski brothers and their ward James McTeigue had good points to offer for enhancing the tale. Still, though, just the fact that he didn't shoot the retakes himself tells that he was unceremoniously dumped from the project. There is no way to tell at the moment whether Hirschbiegel's version, from last year, would have been a masterpiece, but, this hodgepodge out now surely is not. The real kicker is that I enjoyed it much more than I probably should have. I like to think that I have Oliver to thank for that.The film itself is of course a new adaptation of the novel The Body Snatchers. An alien lifeform has come to Earth, begins to inhabit the humans, and transforms them during their sleep into a being without emotion. Maybe it is because I am reading Atlas Shrugged at the moment, or because the novel was written after World War II, but the tale has a pretty overt anti-Communism bent. There are many moments speaking of how conflict is human nature and that once our world becomes peaceful and serene, we then cease to be human. This is quite obvious when the leader of the aliens talks of how war has stopped and peace treaties are being signed everywhere. These pod-people have no anger or fear and therefore are able to coexist peacefully, but what is the point of living unafraid when you can't ever be happy or joyful in that tranquility? The people who have been taken over have now become a collective, out to convert all those different from them. They live together for the good of the group, while the "capitalists" strive for feeling and emotion and life to be lived. The real interesting thing, though, while being anti-Communist, it is also pro-war. This is a rare thing nowadays in film. When Iraq and Darfur are mentioned here, it is to show how the aliens have alleviated these problems. In effect, the bad guys have stopped the war that our heroes have started. Fascinating to think about.Since the story is known by most people alive today, it has been made into film so many times, we need to talk about the artistry of what is on screen. This film is definitely a mixed bag. Like so many hijacked works, there are many instances of cutting that appear awkward and choppy. Whether a weird tonal shift or a huge jump in time, it feels as though someone laid all the footage taken and hacked and slapped it together to try and keep coherence by using the thriller aspects of Hirschbiegel's stock with the action sequences of McTeigue. Lets just say that this is annoying and makes you realize you are witnessing a movie, never letting you soak completely into the tale. With that said, someone did an amazing job with editing nonetheless. Sprinkled in with the disjointedness are moments of genius?a splicing of past, present, and future in a single vignette. I've seen this trick used before, the film eludes me now, and I love it. While our stars talk about what they must do, we see flashes of past instances, which led to their thought process, along with flashes of how they actually do what they are discussing. We then get the planning, the thinking, and the execution all at once for what is an exhilarating experience. Credit to either Hirschbiegel or McTeigue for that bit of artistry, whomever was responsible.When all is said and done, though, the film is really just a slight actioner that tries to thrill. It is a bit of a headcase, never quite knowing what kind of film it wants to be and as a result can never be a success. I applaud Daniel Craig, Jeremy Northam, and especially Jeffrey Wright for not choosing to phone in their performances, but instead take their roles seriously. As for Nicole Kidman, I can't say the same. While the cinematography is wonderful throughout, always on eye level and always in close-up, I almost wish it weren't. While in any other film I would thoroughly enjoy non-stop Kidman, here it just doesn't work. The whole Meg Ryan/ collagen lip thing is very unattractive, and her voice is annoying. Whether it's the lips or the whispered voice to disguise her accent, it is just plain bad. While she gets better as the film continues, the early scenes are atrocious. When the camera cuts to her while seeing a patient, her expression is total fake doctor pretending to care about your troubles for as long as needed until I can write you a prescription. She plays a psychiatrist like the kind of stereotype that her ex-husband hates. Maybe some Scientology Tom Cruise rubbed off on her because she makes the occupation out to be a joke, even to the point where she decides to solve problems with more meds. Her look of interest is amateurish and never natural. Tom must be proud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, we have the unfortunate "invasion", if you will, of the IMDb Bury Brigade toasting a superb movie without really offering any justifiable criticisms in their responses. I would really like to ask these people,"Did you even WATCH the movie at all?" First of all, the performances on the part of both Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman were absolutely stunning. Nicole's performance was so believable that I felt exhausted during her intense fight to stay awake in order not to become an unfortunate victim of the alien virus. Secondly, this was a very worthy remake of a sci-fi classic and I even have to admit that I liked this one better than even the original and definitely more than any of the other remakes that have ever been produced.So, please. Do not listen to the negative rants of the critics on this one. I can guarantee that you will find this film to be a highly engaging, and intelligent, sci-fi thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Invasion" isn't to me a classic, yet it's entertaining and worth a watch with some interesting moments and good acting from Nicole Kidman. Kidman stars as Carol Bennell a Washington, D.C. psychiatrist who one day meets with a patient who claims her husband is no longer really her husband. Soon that will be the norm as the viewer finds that the whole national capital is under the control of people who are zombie like and act very different. All of this apparently resulted from particles left over from a space shuttle crash which has left some type of dead virus that has affected humans. The virus is mostly transmitted thru saliva and liquids as it's crazy during moments of the film as the infected will spit on the last of the human race to try and inflict them. So it's up to Carol to save the day thru science and experiment with chemicals at the national government lab with the help of a scientist(played by Daniel Craig). As well portrayed in the film this overtakes all headlines just as in real life when such outbreaks happen they become media darlings and we like forget about Iraq and terrorism. The movie is also interesting and entertaining with car chases and crashes and the need to save the human race. And anything is worth a watch with the charming and beautiful Nicole Kidman her performance here was glossy and soulful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What were You thinking? Like Honestly.I'm actually upset with you.With the original "Invasion" films, we have gotten a gloomy, scary theme of "Who do I/Can I trust?". And we have gotten a strong protagonist. And overall all of the "Invasion" films have been great or at least enjoyable.Sadly with this new, I guess "re-imagining", we end up with an oddly put together film. Let me start with the feel of the film.If you have seen ANY of the original or re-makes of the "Invasion" films, you know we have that "Who do I/Can I Trust" theme, so you won't really be overly sold on the theme alone, soley based on the fact you aren't going to be shocked if someone turns out not to be who they say they are.Let me take us onto the Cast of this film.In the originals/re-makes, we have gotten ourselves an overall strong performance from the characters. But in this we get a mixed cast, mostly for these reasons. Daniel Craig, he's great...but... not in this, because he seems so bored and unimpressed with where this is going. Nicole Kidman, i usually like her, in this I wanted her character to die. Then the rest of the cast has a mixed feeling amongst them, mostly because a lot of them don't seem to want to sell the movie to anyone.I guess the directing isn't bad, so i won't attack.But really there is no need to this is film, it doesn't do anything for anyone. It's just so meh.Thanks Hollywood, for wasting talent, and my time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that I expected more from a movie that stars Nicole Kidman. I was curious at first but as the movie progressed, I got frustrated and so bored that I ended up admiring Nicole's beauty instead of focusing on what was happening with the characters. The idea of an "invasion" either made by some virus or by aliens is not new and I've watched a lot of movies from the same genre that put their characters in much more harsher situations. But with other movies, the thrilling parts usually come from unexpected and continuous events while in this movie, the thrilling parts come from unexpected carelessness or even stupidity of our heroine. I understand a mother's desire to rescue her son but how could she just walked into her ex-husband's house without support when she had already suspected him to be infected? And in a scene when she was reunited with her son, maybe she was so happy that she left the door open (again, in enemy's territory) and I could immediately predict that someone would walk in. The acting is great but clearly the script is lacking. In conclusion, if you just want some entertainment and some thrilling but not-so-intense moments, you can watch this movie. Don't expect too much because you would be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid first half gives way to a forgettable second</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being the third remake of a classic '50s-era B-movie chiller, THE INVASION actually manages to hold its own and wring maximum suspense from the familiar premise ? at least until the second half, where it pretty much falls apart. While my favourite of the "body snatchers" films will always be the incredibly claustrophobic and chilling 1978 version starring Donald Sutherland, at least this is a credible attempt at reinterpreting the story and far better than Abel Ferrera's 1993 variant. German director Oliver Hirschbiegel, who made the 'last days of Hitler' thriller DOWNFALL, proves himself a force to be reckoned with in the early scenes here, investing moments with an utter alien eeriness that's just as good as in the Kaufman flick. The plot doesn't hang around, the invasion is underway pretty fast, and there are a ton of creepy/spooky moments to enjoy (the visiting census man is one such highlight).And then?the studio saw the completed draft of the film and decided there wasn't enough action or things blowing up. The decent, slow-moving, suspenseful scenes were jettisoned and some generic chase stuff brought in, in which Kidman et al attempt to evade capture by driving around in burning cars, driving through things, running down streets, ad nauseum. The second half of the film turns into some bland, seen it all before thriller, and it's so predictable that I felt like screaming. Had the film stayed focused to Hirschbiegel's vision, it could have been a made for the '70s outing, but instead it turns into typical Hollywood tosh.Still, kudos is still there for the first half. The acting talent, too, isn't half bad. Kidman looks eerie to begin with ? some kind of post-production manipulation has happened here to give her skin a flawless, elfin look ? and I enjoyed watching her trying not to fall asleep. Craig just plays a nice guy, which makes a later twist more effective. Jeffrey Wright, who plays Felix Leiter in the new Bond movies, is excellent as a sympathetic scientist, and even Veronica Cartwright ? who starred in the 1978 version ? pops up as a psychiatric patient convinced her husband is a stranger. Until the repetitive action starts, the film's generally devoid of special effects which heightens the stark realism, and I had real hopes that it was going to be something other than a missed opportunity. Studio interference ruins a good film once again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well intentioned thoughtful failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tries to rework the whole body snatcher concept to encompass new realities, but doesn't go far enough to get there. It signals so clearly so quickly that the pods won't win and assimilation is reversible that the tension is seriously diffused. At the same time, the pod system offers an alternative to our current political and social disorder; in the background you hear reports of peace in the middle east and reconciliation between the United States and Venezuela. However, instead of playing this theme up for some sort of ambiguity, the pod beings don't get along with dogs. In a choice between world peace and no dogs, what choice is there? In the originals the trade off is between order and love, while this one introduces some mild indications that the pod beings are still capable of affection and empathy. This theme is handled blandly and is countered by the plot twist that a main character is immune to assimilation. Even worse, Kidman is surrounded by people who are helpful and know what is going on and that network prevails right to the end, eliminating the sense of isolation that is another hallmark of body snatcher movies. It is as though the filmmaker wants to avoid any serious sense of threat or tension. Maybe they were pod people themselves, or the movie is intended to create the experience of being assimilated! I can say for sure it is a vehicle for displaying Nicole Kidman's figure in a series of tasteful rib knit tops, which does provide some interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Invasion sounds promising enough and could have been awesome. But this is basically just a bland and dull version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers.I will tell you about it casually. The acting is quite good for the most part. Kidman and Craig are excellent as usual. But that pretty much sums up all the positive factors. The negative factors are much more dominant. The characters are a bit stiff and so is the entire setup. The cinematography is good, but the editing is sometimes dreadful. There are some idiotic plot holes and details that made me think a great deal about the level of inconsistency in the movie. Oh yeah, and the whole thing was incredibly boring. There is nothing that makes us remember anything from it. It is just so incredibly dull. For a horror movie it doesn't feature any psychological terror or gore at all: it is, like I said, a trip to Dullsville.This one deserves a four out of ten. It is not even mediocre, but lazy and pointless. I hated it. But it is not Tommy Wiseau-style either; there is some technical insight behind the craftsmanship. But please stick to the original remake from the seventies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right at the beginning of "The Invasion," the thought comes that "I've seen this before." A couple of minutes later, the thought comes that "I've seen this before, too." Alas, folks, the plot is a slightly adapted recycling of the 1997 TV miniseries "Invasion" starring Luke Perry with some "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" thrown in, along with a pinch of 1986's "Lifeforce" (a really, really, really bad film) and a dash of "Species II." This film might be entertaining to viewers unfamiliar with the above titles, but even taken on its own terms as a distinct work, it doesn't work. The direction is clumsy, the editing is choppy, the pacing is ponderous, and the filmmakers mostly fail to deliver anything scary or suspenseful.The two lead actors, Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig (just beginning his career as James Bond), are both gorgeous, but both appear to be pretty much phoning in their performances; the same goes for most of the rest of the cast.Message to any newcomers to SF reading this review: Your time is better spent seeking out the original "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." Yes, it is rather dated, but it's still scarier than this film.</fullReview>

Basically, this was just a slightly better, high budget version of a Sy-Fy made for TV movie. The science is bad (or non-existent), there is little (or no) attention to detail, etc... What the movie has going for it however is Nicole Kidman... Even though this is certainly not a role she will be remembered for, she carries the movie almost single handedly. Daniel Craig is basically wasted here, I don't even know what he was paid for in this film, his role is so marginal it makes no sense in my mind to enroll such a star and then do nothing with him... The rest is all average, the music, the cinematography, the script, etc. It will kill an hour and a half of your time decently though, so what the heck!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly effective retelling of the classic sci-fi thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 2007 sci-fi thriller starring Nicole Kidman is the fourth film version of Jack Finney's novel "The Body Snatchers," the earlier movies being the classic 1956 "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" and its 1978 remake of the same name, and 1993's "Body Snatchers." (Actually, it's the fifth one, if you also count "Invasion of the Pod People," a direct-to-video bomb described by one IMDb reviewer as "a flick about an alien ginger plant that turns mean girls into sex-starved, naked lesbians.") But a good story can stand repeated interpretations, and this is no exception. Although Kidman's acting is in some scenes fairly stiff, and Daniel Craig (fresh off his first turn as James Bond) seems somewhat wasted in his role as her boyfriend, this is a surprisingly effective version, nicely playing up the most important element of the story: the growing apprehension and suspicion that captures the quickly-dwindling number of uninfected people. With almost no sci-fi trappings other than minimal make-up effects, the movie instead emphasizes that psychological angle; the victims are not physically replaced as in the earlier films, but mentally enslaved. (In a small but key role, Veronica Cartwright plays one of the few who are immune, a tip of the hat to the 1978 version in which she also appeared.) A new element is the introduction of a child character, the safety of whom is a key motivator for Kidman, who plays the boy's mother. While this film does take a slightly different route from its predecessors in replacing the original bean-like "pods" with a virus-like epidemic brought to Earth on a crashing space shuttle, it repeats a key plot point: that "they get you when you're asleep." Since everyone has at some time had the experience of struggling to stay awake, this puts the audience right in the same situation: what if staying awake meant more than seeing the end "The Tonight Show," but was instead a matter of life and death? I know some reviewers are upset with the producer's decision &gt;&gt;&gt;SPOILER ALERT&lt;&lt;&lt; to have mankind ultimately defeat the alien invasion, but the "twist ending" from the earlier films is already well-known, so little is lost from having the plot of this one essentially tied up in a neat little bow (although I must admit that the climactic "escape" scene that ultimately leads to the victory was a bit lackluster.)Still, while by no means a science fiction classic, "The Invasion" is an entertaining movie, and well worth seeing at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Invasion (2007): Dir: Oliver Hirschbiegel / Cast: Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, Jeffrey Wright, Jeremy Northam, Jackson Bond: This is easily the worst of the Body Snatchers films with penetration still being the theme but never fully examined here. The 1956 version was groundbreaking and suspenseful with a remake in 1978 that is easily one of the best of remakes with its paranoia theme. This one seems more action oriented than thrilling and even those scenes will put viewers in that sleep state that victims are subdued too. Directing and production are fine but the cast are a complete waste. Nicole Kidman holds her own as a mother struggling to find answers and a solution. Her son apparently is immune to the virus so she requests that he inject her if she happens to drift off asleep. Daniel Craig should fire his agent after going from James Bond to this. His role is merely a potential romantic prop that is beneath his talent. Jeffrey Wright is another worthy talent who makes a wasted appearance. Jeremy Northam plays Kidman's ex-husband who will obviously become infected early. Jackson Bond plays Kidman's son who is about as useless as mowing grass in five feet of snow. The 1956 and 1978 versions are highly recommended thrill rides that work, while this stupid and pointless film invaded by idiocy and a complete lack of intelligence. Score: 3 ? / 10</fullReview>

There's little originality, but the production and editing is solid. Even though it's not new, the scenes are well acted and there is established tension. The movie loses it towards the end though, it completely blows off the ending with what, a ho-hum car chase?! Again quite disappointing.

		<fullReview>This is yet another adaptation of The Body Snatchers. The space shuttle explodes and crashes bringing an alien virus. It spreads quickly throughout the world. Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman) is a psychiatrist who has a patient (Veronica Cartwright) who is claiming to find troubling signs in her husband. Carol brings something strange to her doctor boyfriend Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig). Eventually they discover that the virus is changing people as they sleep.When there is a great idea, people will hammer it into oblivion. Bringing Veronica Cartwright on is an obvious ploy to hearken back to past glory. Is there anything new here? No. There are a few interesting scenes. I really like the subway scene. But there is nothing here to justify a whole new movie. They have reduced the concept to a simple mother and son story. That is the real takeaway.The subway is probably the highest point of the movie. After that point, the movie gets too unrealistic. More than that, it becomes unimportant. Her only goal is to rescue her boy. It's a noble goal. But it's a relatively small goal considering that the world is collapsing. The movie scale kept growing, but the goal kept getting smaller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Invasion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Finney's 1955 science fiction novel The Body Snatchers has proved out to be very filmable over the decades. The first film adaptation, Don Siegel's Invasion of the Body Snatchers, was produced barely a year after the novel came out and belongs among the best older sci-fi movies. I haven't seen the next two adaptations/remakes from 1978 and 1993 by Philip Kaufman and Abel Ferrara respectively, but the most recent version of the old story, Oliver Hirschbiegel's The Invasion, is no match against the first film.The premise of the story is the same as before: some kind of alien spores or bacteria arrive on Earth on a crashed space shuttle and reach contact with the residents of the area. Soon, people and animals start behaving in an oddly emotionless and uncanny way. This is also noticed by Dr. Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman), a psychiatrist, who eventually realizes the danger the infected pose to herself, her young son Oliver (Jackson Bond) and romantic partner Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig). A race against time and Carol's ex-husband Tucker (Jeremy Northam) begins, but it may already be too late...The studio was reportedly unhappy with the film Hirschbiegel had directed and hired the Wachowski brothers to do some rewriting of Dave Kajganich's script and James McTeigue to shoot additional scenes in order to insert more action to the story. Perhaps the film's shortcomings can be attributed to this kind of dumbing down, but it is frustrating to see such a good-looking movie with such boring scenes. Indeed, the visual style of The Invasion is very pleasant to watch with its tones of yellow and cold turquoise. The subdued music by John Ottman also stays pleasantly low-key and unconventional throughout, as opposed to the bombastic scores of many other suspense movies.After having directed his breakthrough success Downfall (2004), a claustrophobic recounting of Adolf Hitler's last days in the Führerbunker in 1945, Hirschbiegel had proved his ability to create suspense with few elements, but with The Invasion he doesn't succeed as well (assuming it is mostly him responsible for the earlier scenes of creeping paranoia). Of course, the well-known Hitler is a delicious protagonist for a story, whereas in an entirely fictional story like this one the characters must be introduced with no previous knowledge of them. Sadly, Carol, Ben, Oliver and even the antagonistic Tucker remain rather bland and uninteresting all the way through; Carol's motherly love to Oliver and her fear for his safety cannot create the necessary tensions for the tale to feel exciting (or maybe I'm just not sensitive toward this type of emotional connections).Ultimately the suspense has to make way for more action-driven scenes that are pretty boring and generic, like in so many sci-fi thrillers before. Some earlier "disturbing" scenes involving vomiting and car crashes look so tacky that I was wondering if it would be best to see The Invasion as a modern day B-movie pastiche (the red-hued poster seems to suggest this as well), but I guess the stars and the budget are too big for such an approach to feel credible, let alone the general tone being so serious. Also, I am not a fan of the frequent CGI flashes of the alien cells interacting with human blood. Other than those clips, the film is delightfully pixel-free though and creates the nasty transformation moments with mostly physical methods instead.If the original film could be seen as an allegory of the Red Scare and its ability to wage paranoia and suspicion among ordinary people, The Invasion could be understood as a similar symbol for the frightened post-9/11 world with potential terrorists lurking everywhere. However, as a suspense thriller it is not very exciting and feels rather lackluster compared to the atmospheric 1956 film. In summary, The Invasion has very nice visuals and music, but character-wise it doesn't live up to the expectations. It is not terrible by any means though, so sci-fi fans can well check it out to pass about 100 minutes of their spare time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forgetting that this is a remake for a moment, lets focus on the film at hand:An alien spore arrives on Earth and infects humans like a virus, changing their DNA to make a collective race of New Beings.Great premise, and at times startling delivery. The movie opens with a bang and never lets up. Its pace is well designed and filled with tension. The highlights are the running undercurrent of "the world is a better place with the New Beings." This satisfies my hunger for some social and political involvement with a film. It is the only thing keeping the movie from becoming a shallow thriller. (Truly effective moments are of "police" dragging Humans to be "processed," reminiscent of civil rights marches and other world dictatorships. It begs the question beyond the obvious: "are we better as Aliens," and moves towards "Does it take extreme force to complete world peace?")With all this going for it, why only 6 stars? Well, the movie as a whole felt too forced - and cold. Lackluster performances and cheap CGI infection scenes mock the truth behind the film, diminishing any real statement.</fullReview>

However, after that it just kind of goes flat. People seem to be changing ... and well, she just has to keep running and looking for her kid - who seems to be immune to the changes. Nicole Kidman's character doesn't seem very believable either - she looks nervous as heck and a "lack of nervousness" is supposed to be her camouflage.Oh well - at least they tried.

The guy used to do some interesting work, at least now and then, but I can't recall the last time he was involved in anything worth watching.I don't want to list all the problems... but you know when a remake resorts to silly car chase &amp; car crash scenes to juice it up, then the whole project is in trouble.Don't bother with this movie. See the original instead. Or the 1970's remake, which was good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the most disjointed film I have ever seen. One moment Carol Bennell is running from the aliens in the suburbs, suddenly she is running in the city centre. In another scene Carol and Ben Driscoll are surrounded inside a building, then the film cuts to them speeding away in a police car with no explanation to how they got there! Not to mention the tons of smaller errors such as when Carol takes off her shoes and is then instantly running in her shoes again.Who edited this!? Was it their part time job? Did they ever actually watch the film again after they shot it?! Did someone steal reels of the film and they never realised....?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Invasion is well made but it's too routine to be scary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Invasion is the third remake of the 1956 original Invasion Of the Body Snatchers. The movie begins with news footage of a crashed space shuttle, which is causing quite a stir because of the possibility of the spread of infections. We then meet a psychiatrist Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman) who unwillingly has to let her son Oliver (Jackson Bond) stay with her ex-husband Tucker (Jeremy Northam) for a few days. Tucker has not been acting normally however, he seems far too emotionless and calm. In fact Carol and others, including her patients, begin to realize this loss of emotion in people all over the place. Carol and her boyfriend Dr. Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig) soon fully understand that a strain of alien bacteria is infecting people all over the world, causing loss of emotion and aggression, and beginning to rapidly take over the populations. Carol and Ben rebel to find Oliver fighting to stay uninfected and not get caught by acting droll and poker faced. Even though the infected people urge them just to let the infection take place, with promises of peace on the planet and no more anger and sadness.I liked the premise of The Invasion but I don't think it plays out as great as it could have. This film is the third remake of a classic horror movie, so things are bound to get a little dull and repetitive. But there are quite a few things this movie does get right. The acting is very strong which I kind of expected. With actors like Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig how could you go wrong? Daniel Craig is a an excellent actor and I'm very glad he's being recognized. Kidman is also looking very good and her acting abilities are as good as ever. The other actors and extras that play the poker faced infected, which I'm going to call them, mostly play the part accordingly. It can't really be that hard to sit there in front of a camera without any expression. In fact they all kind of remind me of Hayden Christenson (Ha Ha).The movie has some great car crashes as well. They were probably the most thrilling part of the whole movie because they were filmed with great camera techniques. The movie also has an evident glossy and smooth look to it which I really liked a lot. The Invasion may not be that scary but it does have a few chilling moments. For instance there is a scene where Carol has a therapy session with a patient. The patient tells her that her husband has not been himself lately, he is far too droll and expressionless. She tells Carol that one night the dog started barking ferociously at him, and that her husband swiftly and easily killed the dog. Without crying or looking sad at all he simply carried the dog away and dropped him in the garbage bin. This scene was very well delivered and effectively creepy. It involves the audience to become frightened by imagining what this woman witnessed, and that element is much stronger than any special effect or blood and gore that horror movies nowadays have to offer. I also enjoyed how it touched with the relentlessly violent and angry world we live in. Since once the alien bacterial invasion began peace and harmony spread all over, which was a topic I wanted the movie to get more into rather than all the action.The Invasion was far too watered down to the point where it's really not all that frightening, in fact it was boring at times. The way the poker faces infect the regular people involves puking bacterial goo on their faces, which is more disgusting than scary. The movie also made a leap from horror to thriller suddenly once the car crashes began, although this makes the lack of scares and real horror a bit more plausible. But there is one huge implausibility that The Invasion forgets to deal with. After someone is infected they turn disgusting and gooey looking overnight, and by the next morning they are fully infected and completely poker faced. There would have been many normal people who realize what was happening to their infected loved one. They would have contacted the authorities and eventually the government would learn of this bacterial strain. In fact the government literally does nothing till the end of the movie which was completely ridiculous. The ending felt like they came up with it on the spot.Overall this movie doesn't have the guts to break from the formula. It is well made and acted, contains an intriguing message, and is nicely shot. But is very devoid of scares and terror. I give The Invasion a 2.5 out of 4. It's an okay movie but not really anything I haven't seen before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice movie, and here's why</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It makes me fun when people tell "this movie has a good end, it's not original, so movie's sux" Movie isn't about ending, it's about what's inside. "The End" is just a scenario point, so if you want to sort it by "good" and "bad", you have only two options and all the movies with "good" ending point is sux. But also movie, if it is art, has an idea and a culmination. What's the idea of The Invasion? I think, the idea is "people could be completely healthy society only in death". Culmination of the movie coincides with the end, and main character (Nicole) comes up with the thought of "is our victory, is this "good end" is really good?" That's why movie isn't empty action and worth of good votes.In conclusion I must say, here's some hurry of subject in the last part of the work and it was hard to me to feel the issue. I think this is imperfection dictated by deadline, action element of whatever, but may be this is a way of expressing the idea.Thanks.</fullReview>

Adding to that, the supporting cast was good as well. I thought Jackson Bond was quite perfect for the role. Overall, the movie did well but I must say I was disappointed with the way the director/writers rushed into the movie. It's like they were thinking "Gosh, let's get this over with!" If only it was longer, I would have liked it even more. And yes, the storyline was a bit simple. If it were to be more complex, I would've applauded the movie with a standing ovation.No matter, the movie was good enough for me. I give it 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than Meets the Eye - And a Decent Pop Corn Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Manhola Dargis, the NYT Reviewer, didn't really fully comprehend "The Invasion" with her bad review, and, most important, she overlooked something very curious about this film, namely, its presentation of the utopia theme. In this rendition of the body snatcher narrative, we've clearly lost the old cold war moorings of the 50s original and are dealing with something quite different here. Utopia has become a significant theme in academic and sci-fi writing recently, and this film has an eerie, nuanced take on that theme that I personally found curious. The film operates with an odd sense of irony, and the point should not be lost on audiences that the civilized world, now mainlining anti-depressants like there's no tomorrow (and which the Kidman character, as a shrink, prescribes) seeks the very sort of controlled, temperate solace the pod people promise to deliver. There is an allegory of self, ideology and utopia which this particular rendition of the pod people narrative delivers that I thought intriguing. The promise of Utopia may be snake oil - or snake slime in this case - but there's also the question of whether humanity is capable of the realization of utopia. Who is more worthy ? pods vrs. humans ? isn't as easily settled here as we might like to think. (And let's not overlook, we certainly see pod persona-as-virtue in our own culture. We may prize "podliness," to coin a phrase, more than we realize) In any case, this isn't your Grandpa's cold war allegory, but something else. And Dargis, who's a pretty smart lady, should have picked up on that. For all its technical and narrative faults, which Dargis makes sound much more damning than they actually are, all the same, Invasion is still worth a matinée. For a "B" narrative film, albeit with an A budget, there's more here than meets the eye - and of that which does solicit the eye, namely Ms. Kidman, well, she looks absolutely smashing. The lady can't help it. I'd be curious to know what Kidman saw in the early script that made her want to do it. Clearly she saw something in the original conception that was worth her time to pursue ? and she has her pick of projects. And some of that early promise, I think, is still to be found in what was delivered. Don't blow this one off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No More Screams Just Constant Noise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing you need to know about The Invasion is that the antipathy bestowed upon it is completely unwarranted, for this is not a bad movie.It's not the greatest entry in the franchise so far, falling short of the truly spectacular 1978 cover, but nor is it the worst. It does succeed in places where the tragic 1990's rendition failed, albeit that one had its moments too.The Invasion, in fact, feels a lot like the pod people won and are now calling the cinematic shots. And from this reviewer, who for one has always wondered whether the pre-pod world was all that hot to begin with, that's a compliment.This latest Body Snatchers has a bit of a mechanical tone to it, and it surely is of the least positive disposition towards "normal" people. Whatever keeps sending these sinister invaders our way must have approved. At any rate, The Invasion is also quite pertinent and has a message to convey about the society we find ourselves living in, although, and unlike its predecessors, it goes to pains in needlessly dating itself. There's constant talk of the war in Iraq, Venezuela's Chavez and North Korean nukes. The politicizing we could have done without.Also, it begins with a worryingly Resident Evil-esquire scene, but we soon find out that it was merely a flash forward. The Invasion has quite a few of those, by the way. After that, it's mostly smooth sailing until the awkward ending.In its favor, the film produces a novel twist on the invaders' arrival, this time not via some whooshing, psychedelic 70's Technicolor wonder but through the vehicle of a shuttle disaster.Once on Earth, the critters begin taking over, and the movie's jabs at contemporary, noise-obsessed society commence. You see, the normals are all emotional, borderline neurotic basket cases addicted to Blackberries, headset-less PSP's and car horns. You can't trust them with anything. The turned people come across as cool, collected and absolutely civil. They just don't have much in the way of emotion.That's why The Invasion can't be written off as a bad flick: it does have something to say, and is surprisingly unabashed about it. And unlike any of the previous episodes, it offers a perplexing choice, almost as if becoming one of them isn't so bad after all. Touched upon in the older movies, here it's much more pronounced, which I for one applaud.So we get Nicole Kidman as Dr. Carol Bennell, a shrink who gradually begins seeing strange things around her. Together with her work scientists Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig) and Stephen Galeano (Jeffrey Wright). While Kidman does a good job overall, the two male leads get very little room to show off their skills.And yes, Nancy Cartwright returns for a cameo and she's as good as ever.There's also some motherly melodrama with Bennell's son Oliver (Jackson Bond), and you will please note that many of the names used are tributes to characters past, only here Bennell and Driscoll are gender-reversed. This also applies to the urban setting, now in east coast DC, which recalls the San Francisco of Kaufman's 1978 rendition, even if its less palpably paranoid.Most likely the one factor contributing to The Invasion's lukewarm reaction is its ending. Well intentioned and meant to make us think about why is it so important to hold on to our humanity, it culminates in a goofy mess where, wait for it, the marines and modern science come to save the day. "Save the day" is bad enough in the Snatchers canon, for what remains without the concept's bleak hopelessness? In The Invasion's case, what remains is the realization that after ridding themselves of hostile interstellar microbes, the characters are back to square one in a world where people kill other people and civility is a thin veneer. If it wasn't so bluntly obvious and tacky, this ending could actually have had some philosophical impact.So yes, this isn't a bad movie. It's too short and not adult-oriented enough, suffers from a cumbersome finale and has very little genuine atmosphere.But it's also inventive with the license given it and highly relevant to the sad truth we all know so well, that indeed civility, our precious social orders and even humanity, are always in question. Something to think about.</fullReview>

I think if this movie would have kept the same mood of those first 30 minutes it would be a good movie.Ah and other thing, they would have made the people infected with the virus a little more smart and without that stupid slow way of walking and talking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surprisingly Above Average Anachronistic Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been many contemporary remakes of older films, like The Manchurian Candidate, Casino Royale, Underneath, or You've Got Mail, that take to the device of anachronizing its timely issues, and the said device of it comes off as just that. The Invasion, however, perhaps like Scarface, maintains the tension and sense of entertainment had by its preceding versions. A surprising follow-up to Olivier Hirschbiegel's incredibly powerful last film, the German docudrama Downfall, his instincts are prevalent in his helming of this unexpectedly decent Hollywood sci-fi update. The intensity and gravity of his portrait of Hitler's reign deflate from that level to the proper size at which a film like The Invasion works as a satisfying thriller, rather than a thriller that is yet the peak of significance portrayed by your average Hollywood studio director-for-hire in his career so far.The story is essentially the same as the previous Body Snatcher films, with the adjustment of sociopolitical renovations involving the current world affairs that include war and other crises, which act not simply as an inert part of the film meant to familiarize itself with current audiences but also as a way to absorb us further into the concept of the world's domination by the pod people, and what they may have to offer through a perfect world without emotion, even though it definitely proves extremely difficult to have fast-paced chase sequences without any emotion on the part of the pod people. Indeed, when a group of them are chasing Kidman and Craig through a passageway, they clearly show frustration, which is an emotion, once they cannot find them.Beside Nicole Kidman, whose strength as an actress lies in the diligent logician whose role as a mother suffers agonizing burden, not so unlike her character in The Others, Jeffrey Wright proves again to be more than token scenery in a supporting role, and rising guy-movie staple Daniel Craig continues to show his true colors as an able dramatic actor in the same action-adventure context.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Half-Hearted Invasion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Finney's original 1950s Collier's Magazine serial of his novel 'The Body Snatchers', obviously spoke to some deep levels in all of us. It has been filmed four times, most recently in this effort of 2007. The earlier versions were in 1956, 1978, and 1993. The first version was the classic, 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', compellingly directed by Don Siegel, and unforgettable to anyone who has seen it. At the time, it shocked cinema audiences round the world. For a low budget black and white film which must have seemed at the time it was being made like just another horror movie, it had a social impact which has never died, and which goes on reverberating. The idea that some seeds or entities from outer space, a kind of intelligent panspermia, might 'invade us' and turn us into emotionless zombies is clearly a fear which goes to the heart of our existential angst. Who are we, and what are we? We are afraid. If you take our emotions away from us, what is left? And then there is the theme brought out so strongly in this version of the film: 'Do not sleep'. Of course, sleep as the metaphor for death represents the very same obliteration of consciousness and loss of identity that being turned into a zombie represents. In this film, Nicole Kidman, who does a very good scared look, is the terrified person who represents all of us. Will her individuality be obliterated? In typical Hollywood fashion, this message has been underlined by 'the threatened child' motif. Nowadays, the formula says that the US audience will be with you all the way if you can just show a threatened child, for whom the parent will sacrifice anything. So there Nicole Kidman is, sacrificing anything to save her son, and the son played by Jackson Bond does have a very sweet and endearing smile, and is a nice kid, well played. Unfortunately, one of the world's most boring actors, Daniel Craig, who can neither act nor even smile properly, is stuck into this film as the leading man. Help! I prefer zombies! In fact, I suspect that Craig would have been cast as one if he could only have acted a little better. Instead, the wonderfully sinister and creepy Jeremy Northam, who really knows how to act, is perfect as Mr. Creep Zombie who unctuously says: 'You don't feel anything.' Yes, Jeremy, quite, except when we look at you as one of 'them' we get really worried. I don't know what it is about Nicole Kidman. I have always felt that she was really a man in a woman's body. Am I imagining this? Of course she is slinky and sexy, but I just can't go along with it. I think she was already 'taken over' (perhaps by the Scientologists?) before she was even cast. Anyway, she at least knows how to act, which is such a relief, as she is the centre of everything. And this version of the film is truly harrowing, with some of the wildest and wackiest extreme editing ever seen in a mainstream film, which intensifies the horror and the pace, although it takes a lot of chances and sometimes misfires. This film will have you on the edge of the same seat you were on the edge of the last time you saw a film of this story. We will never be free of our worries about being 'taken over'. However, it is less likely to be by seeds from space (I missed the pods this time, by the way) than by 'them' of our own species, I mean the mutants who ... well, maybe I had better not spell it out, but just think conspiracy theory and you get the idea.</fullReview>

Those who come in contact with it are changing in ominous and inexplicable ways. Soon Washington, DC psychiatrist Carol Bennell and her friend, Dr. Ben Driscoll, learn the shocking truth about the growing extraterrestrial epidemic: it attacks its victims while they sleep, leaving them physically unchanged but strangely unfeeling and inhuman. As the infection spreads, more and more people are altered and it becomes impossible to know who can be trusted.

One scene that the little boy smiled to her before she walked him to school and later it caught her to feel so emotional to think about that, Nicole gave an A+ act in this scene, it hurts when I see her cried. The drive in her character is not only how smart a doctor she is in the film, it's more the mother kind of power to me. It's beautiful to see that element in this si-fi film, isn't it? Nicole now is really in her high peak of acting career, she still tried her best to take all the different kind of characters, I love her for doing so. It feeds me great deal as a movie goer, to see a wonderful talent like her making the film with her standard. Even in this light touch of Hollywood film, with her presence, it's worthy to watch twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Invasion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems like Nicole Kidman's The Invasion is something like a tit-for-tat response to ex Mr Nicole Kidman's War of the Worlds. Aliens from outer space, check. Estranged spouse (the cinematic one that is), check. Cute toddler kid, check. Being the only one who figures what could be going on, check. Lots of running, check. Single parent power, check. Having people clamour on your escape vehicle, check. Cop out Hollywood styled ending mocking the aliens, check. Pointless remake? Probably not, and that's its leg up against the tripods.The Invasion is an update to the many movies based on Jack Finney's novel The Body Snatchers, and the last movie I can remember about the same was the one starring Garbrielle Anwar (that beautiful lady who tango-ed with Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman, and together like Chris O'Donnell, has already faded from the limelight). At its core the story's about how alien lifeforms start to take control of human beings by being their doppelgangers, and with behaviour like a Stepford Wife, it's definitely not appreciated by those who value their freedom and the ability to choose.The movie did try to elevate itself from the run of the mill thrillers, in putting in not so sublime anti-war-anti-terror messages. In its cinematic world, the war on Iraq is over with the US troop pullout, and the Koreas get unified. That's because the aliens have taken over and taught us truly what world peace is all about. And therein lies the issue - if we're beings who strive for the greater good, why not let the aliens take over, instead of resisting and insisting on continuing our flawed existence? A human utopia is impossible, given our human nature to suspect, fight, and kill each other. Borg-like assimilation however, we cannot accept.So Nicole Kidman's psychiatrist Carol Bennell and Daniel Craig's doctor Ben Driscoll (who looks just very Blond here in bland Bond like moments) seem to be the few who would take a long time being found out to be puny humans, and battle it out with the aliens in a hide and seek cat and mouse game, together with cute kid Jackson Bond as Carol's son Oliver. You cannot sleep, and you cannot show emotion, lest you be pinned down, given a taste of a tazer, turn into a cocoon and wake up a new person.The movie does have its fair share of excitable moments, contrary to what I would have believed from other opinions of the movie, and there are genuine, effective jump at your seat episodes. While Craig is bland, Nicole Kidman is reason enough to watch the movie as firstly, she illuminates the screen with her gorgeous poise, even when she's trying to be robot like, or running around with kid in tow frantically trying to save their souls from zombie-like humans, who thankfully subscribe to the George A Romero model rather than the Danny Boyle one (though I would have loved to see more energetic aliens takeover than the docile world-peace loving ones here).My greatest beef with the show however, is how everything must be ended nicely, bright sunshine and all. Woefully typical, instead of my personal preference for an apocalyptic styled one. Perhaps therein lies the belief that we humans can provide the fix for our flaws, in good time to come, as Carol Bennell so confidently states early in the movie.</fullReview>

Daniel Craig went from a superb regeneration of James Bond to a part that had the emotion of a cucumber sandwich. Nicole Kidman can act, and even if the part is good, the part still has to be supported by the rest of the movie. I suppose my biggest dislike was the fact that the benign invaders had to throw up on or into something of their victim: pre-teens potential? Intelligent life from outer space that has adapted the capability to "adopt" the physical being of it's earthly victim, surely does not need such a dozey way of contaminating new victims. I also felt the quality of the performances by both Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig harmonized with the impoverished direction and scripting: the result was, yes you read it, a 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't believe the (negative) hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of the genre and previous incarnations of the book, save the 70s version (which i have not seen in its entirety, nor particularly care for viewing) i bought into the negative hype surrounding The Invasion, due to the films use of a virus instead of the pods. I admit it. I made a judgment before having seen the movie. Which was perhaps not wise, but then it was more of a pleasant surprise when this movie turned out to be highly adequate. Oh go on then, ill allow myself the emotional reaction missing from the titular visitors; the movie was great.Though, I've noticed my reaction to films has a lot to do with my state when watching, and i was chilled and calm, before watching, allowing the creeping dread of seeing a world gradually overtaken by the conscious infection to arise unabated. For all the negative reviews i have seen for this movie, i really cant fathom it. It hits all the right buttons, and is hardly run of the mill. Kidman is as Kidman does, and you cant really ask for Oscar performance in the hokey overplayed sci-fi genre, (or maybe i'm being somewhat narrow minded) but what i know is i enjoyed it all. And beyond existential introspection thats all i ask for from a movie these days.P.S. I ain't not never read the book</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a big fan of the 1955 (56?)original, and even an admirer of the 1978 remake by Phillip Kaufman (I have not seen Abel Ferrara '93 version) I approached this version with a mixture of trepidation and interest. The basic story of ourselves being taken over by 'the other' has endless possibilities, and can be used to illuminate the darker corners of the human soul, our paranoia (as the original did with the fears over Communism etc), but I am afraid that this version fails to do this after a promising start.The concept of the Space Shuttle crash landing back on earth, bringing with it some form of alien life, is actually rendered fairly believable at the start of this film, and the change in behaviour in some of the characters, especially that played by Jeremy Northam, is well done. Nichol Kidman's growing sense of isolation and paranoia is handled well, but beyond this I found the rest of the cast totally unbelievable, most notably Daniel 'James Bond' Craig, who seems to be total miscast. What really lets the film down, and is the biggest cause of disappointment, is the fact that the issues raise, what makes us humans etc, are brushed aside as the film quickly becomes just another chase movie, with an ending which is, frankly, awful.One question - if the mutant humans have become so unemotional then why do they show so much anger when chasing Nicol Kidman and a.n.other?! Surely their cold logic would have caused them to find an easy, effective way to deal with them? Oh well, maybe I am expecting too much from a typical empty headed bit of Hollywood fluff!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not trust anyone. Do not show emotion. Do not fall asleep.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A space shuttle mysteriously crashes on Earth, and an extraterrestrial disease in the wreckage begins infecting human beings. A psychiatrist from Washington, D.C., Carol Bennell, and her colleague Ben Driscoll discover that the transformation caused by the infection is triggered by REM sleep, robbing the victims of their humanity. As the infection spreads, fewer people can be trusted. Fighting to stay awake, Carol looks for her son, who may hold the answer to stopping the invasion.So, there have been like what, three movies on this already, excluding "The Faculty"? And you heard the movie did some re-shoots, which most of the times means bad news? And you're expecting why remake a movie that has been remade two to three times already? Sure, it's excessive, but I like it!Unlike the 1978 version of the movie, this film is more fast paced and a lot louder. The whole movie moves like a speeding bullet just because, I assume, we've seen at least one version of this story already. It doesn't get deep from the explanation to the transformation of the pod people but goes to what makes these movies so good and eerie.Reshoots done by the Wachowski brothers must at least mean one thing: The action scenes are great! And you're right! At least the film doesn't drag from the explanation of how and why the aliens are here. There are even some scenes that are actually quite surprising and scary, with the strange tone.Other from that, there's nothing new to see here. It still has most things that was in the 1978 version, but this is like "Final Destination" to me. If they do something the same differently, I'll still like it. Nicole Kidman also gives a really good performance and finally a kid, Jackson Bond, actually gives us a decent performance. I won't say much about Daniel Craig because he isn't really in the movie as much as the poster shows.This may be the "House of Wax (2005)" of this year because critics panned this and I loved it! I even thought this was better than the 1978 version but since I've seen that movie first, I knew what was going to happen before it did. I still had a great time though. If you're a fan of any of the three or four versions, you should watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Same as many other reviewers, I haven't watched or heard this movie before I enter the cinema, my aunt told me it was a popular film when she was young so we bought the tickets. From what my aunt said, the original movie (or novel?) was trying to portray those invaders as communists, I don't know if this is true or the director is still trying to do the same, but it's interesting to see the cool down of so many international conflicts after many people were infected, does it mean our world would be better or worse if all of us got infected? I would give it only 6 stars, it's not boring movie, but I wouldn't want to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>without Kidman's compelling presence, this would've tanked further, but all in all it delivers the frights</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"For better or worse, we're human again..." While suffering bad reviews, comparing it to the two previous renditions of The Invasion of the Body Snatchers, 2007's The Invasion works as a pretty good suspense thriller, mainly because of Nicole Kidman's strong performance. The supporting cast was pretty good, too. Wonder how director Oliver Hirschbiegel's original cut was, as the movie had to be reshot and redirected by the Wachowskis (prolly not mainstream enough?).This is the German director's Hollywood debut, and he tells the story of a strange pandemic that turns humans into zombie-like closet aliens in a flurry of flash-forwards. He starts in the middle with a frantic pharmacy scene to immediately establish the chaos, then hurtles back to the past to tell the audience how they got there.Kidman plays psychiatrist Carol Bennell, who intuits the dubious alien activity. She teams up with her colleague Dr. Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig) to protect her son Oliver (Jackson Bond), who may somehow be key to stopping the invasion. Craig still looks like a caveman but somehow maintains a likable quality, enough to make sense being alongside Kidman. The adorable Jackson is thankfully terrific and convincing, like a male Dakota Fanning.Jeremy Northam plays baddie Tucker Kaufman, Bennell's ex and Oliver's father, and his polished features and understated acting gave extraterrestrial a touch of class despite the disgusting manner of conversion.This was actually a good formula suspense flick; it probably got so much flak because it strayed from the heavier sci-fi approach of the original. The director's stylized approach may have been more distracting than helpful and without Kidman's compelling presence, this would've tanked further, but all in all it delivers the frights, and the updated backstory makes the unbelievable plot relevant and even thought-provoking: are we really better off being human?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A rushed, blurry movie but worthwhile to view. Of all of the Body Snatcher movies, this one comes close to Jack Finney's ending in his 1955 novel that started it all.Notes: 1. Space shuttle crash brings the spores to earth? C'mon, makes better sense to have a meteor shower with spores rain down across the countryside. Folks come in contact with it, get infected and change during RIM sleep.2. Gone are the seed pods..this is just plain infection. OK, I can buy that part. But, vomiting into the victim's face or spiking their drinks to spread the infection? They should already be infected by casual contact.3. And, yes. The ending is a bit too tidy. But, after the doom and gloom of the previous snatcher movies.... it's a welcomed ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardly Invasive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you live in a world where violence is the answer to so many conflicts and misunderstandings, manifesting itself as war or hate crimes or road rage, it is easy to see aggression as an instinctual human behaviour. We don't like to acknowledge it as such but we certainly can't pretend it isn't there. In response, we humans do what we can to keep these impulses under control. Some of us meditate; some of us medicate. We strive to be better people and better people don't give in to their anger. In Oliver Hirschbiegel's THE INVASION (a remake of the 1956 classic, INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS), a unique opportunity is given to humanity. You are first infected with an alien genetic code. Then, when you fall into REM sleep, your genetic code is reprogrammed. You wake up feeling refreshed and like yourself, with all your memories and knowledge in tact. There is just one tiny difference. There is no more hate. Only humanity rejects this opportunity despite all their previous efforts to accomplish exactly this. While this conundrum might make THE INVASION insightful, it certainly doesn't make it necessary. After all, the original already made that point over fifty years ago.I suppose the rational was to bring attention to all that we have in place today to help numb our senses. THE INVASION is determined to assert itself as a timely film while distancing itself from its B-movie roots. In the original, the alien epidemic makes its way to neighboring towns with farmers making their deliveries. Flash forward to 2007 and the disease is traveling the globe through contaminated e-bay purchases. Granted, times are more complicated than they used to be. Nicole Kidman's Carol Bennell text messages her son, Oliver (Jackson Bond), to remind him to take his anti-anxiety medication before bed while he stays with his father for the first time after his parents' divorce. Between all that, the portable video games and seemingly endless hours of television watching, there are plenty of ways to numb the senses. Perhaps Hirschbiegel wanted to modernize BODY SNATCHERS into a contemporary thriller to shake people up, to show that we all need a good smack in the face to wake ourselves from our trances. After all, if Carol Bennell is fighting her hardest to hold on to the spirit inside of her, why have we allowed our modern world, read aliens, to dull our potential? To make that point though, THE INVASION would have to actually be thrilling.Aside from a few unexpected scares, THE INVASION is pretty low on chills. In fact, it often feels as though the film is having its own crisis of identity, bouncing back between a polished, intellectual suspense piece and an explosive, effects-heavy action flick. This might have something to do with the number of hands involved in the production. Hirshbiegel's original cut was said to be tepid and drawn out. The producers, who had already sunk a lot of money into the film, called in bigger boys to tweak it here and there into something with a bit more pulse. The Wachowski Brothers (THE MATRIX) were brought in for rewrites and James McTeigue (V FOR VENDETTA) was hired to shoot new footage. Without seeing Hirschbiegel's original product, it's impossible to say for certain whether they helped or hurt the final version but THE INVASION's visual aesthetic is probably the strongest thing it has going. Slick picture and sharp edits that play with time and space add a much-needed edge to a story that has been dulled by an air of self-importance. The final cut is well paced and smooth but the film's salvation was clearly more important than creating meaning in humanity saving itself.It's funny when you think about. THE INVASION warns us of what might lie ahead if we continue to allow our modern conveniences to run and control our lives. If we would just think less about everything, than it wouldn't bother us so much but the sacrifice is human development and progress. Yet, in order to actually enjoy THE INVASION, one has to do exactly that ? stop fighting, shut off and allow the reprogramming to happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Invasion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard a few things about this long before seeing it, and when I realised it was another remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers I was certainly interested, from director Oliver Hirschbiegel (Downfall), and additional director James McTeigue (V for Vendetta). Basically a space shuttle returning to Earth explodes, and fragments of it are landing in a few places, and they are also bringing an alien virus that will cause serious consequences to the human race. This virus recodes human DNA while they are sleeping, so this alien virus spawns a large number of extra-terrestrial mindless copies intent on taking over the world. In Washington, psychiatrist Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman) is seeing a few patients, including Wendy Lenk (Veronica Cartwright), who notice their other halves are not their usual selves, they have no reactions to situations that otherwise they would have, and they believe they are different people all together. Carol along with her friend Dr. Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig) and researcher Dr. Stephen Galeano (Jeffrey Wright) discover this epidemic that affects people in their sleep, and they also find out that her son Oliver 'Ollie' (Jackson Bond) is immune to the disease. So with hundreds of people changing into these mindless zombie like beings, it is hard to escape the threat and they are doing everything they can to get away and get the cure safe. The other problem with the threat is that you don't know who to trust, and you especially can't be sure if someone you know is still their real self. Also starring Jeremy Northam as Tucker Kaufman, Josef Sommer as Dr. Henryk Belicec, Celia Weston as Ludmilla Belicec and Roger Rees as Yorish. Kidman who apparently got injured in a stunt, and Craig who the year before proved himself as the new James Bond 007, both of them are daft casting, the special effects are quite wasted, and there are about two tense moments, so overall it is probably the worst of the remakes, a waste of time science-fiction horror thriller. Pretty poor!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I never knew that lack of emotion could be so fearful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was quite a surprise to find out that the latest movie featuring Nicole Kidman was a bit of a horror movie. Upon reading the title, I had expected it to be a drama or perhaps a comedy but certainly not a movie about zombie-like humans stalking the remainder of humanity. True: Nicole Kidman is one of the most versatile actresses having done all kinds of different genres such as action ("Batman forever"), comedy ("Bewitched"), musical ("Moulin rouge!"), thriller ("The others") and of course drama ("The hours"). Now she can add a new genre to her great film career even though "The invasion" is only horror on paper, because there is hardly any blood or gore to be found (which I think is a good thing). It is much more a psychological thriller that will drive up the tension slowly as well as provide a good fright every now and then.Another actor who isn't shy of jumping genres is Daniel Craig. He became famous in the movie "Tomb Raider" and continued from there as a mob figure in "Road to perdition" to eventually become the new James Bond. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I was amazed that a thriller-horror remake would contain two A-list actors. The horror-genre is usually something established actors would like to avoid as much as possible. It is more often than not the ultimate way for any talented young actor to gain quick stardom. Jamie Lee Curtis became famous through "Halloween", Kevin Bacon did the same through "Friday the 13th" and Johnny Depp got a name for himself by playing one of the victims in "A nightmare on Elm Street". Even Jack Nicholson played in a few forgotten horror pictures before becoming an icon.For whatever reason Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig chose to be a part of this project, it isn't a bad call. "The invasion" is a good movie and one of the finest thriller-horror remakes ever made. The story is about an alien epidemic sweeping the world and turning people into emotionless replica's. The original film and its finest remake (the one featuring Donald Sutherland and Jeff Goldblum of 1978) are a bit more horror-driven than this one. Those familiar with more than one version will notice the few changes this film has made. Apart from the slightly disappointing ending (which I believe is the only real flaw this movie has), everything falls pretty much into place. They also seem to rush things a little too hard near the end, but that might be the obvious choice of the director to put a little action into the plot. Pity however that these very scenes appear overly hectic for they clearly diminish the stressful fear that this otherwise very decent thriller earlier had.The cast is very good. Nicole Kidman proves once more that she truly is a multi-talented woman. Daniel Craig provides a couple of lighter moments in this film. His character seems somewhat similar to some of his past characters, but he still manages to grab your attention. There is also a kid named Jackson Bond (the new 007 perhaps?) and he does fairly good given the fact that this is his first movie ever. He's done some television work before all of this. Veronica Cartwright should ring a bell amongst movie fanatics for she appeared in numerous of interesting thrillers. Some of those are "The birds" (yes, the Hitchcock-one of 1963), the 1978-"Invasion of the body snatchers", "Alien" and The witches of Eastwick" featuring a brilliant Jack Nicholson, a heavenly Michelle Pfeiffer and plastic-face singer/actress Cher.In short: "The invasion" is a good thriller mainly because, as a remake telling the same story all over again, it still manages to be quite refreshing supported by a beautiful cast. Shame about the ending though: but those who have never watched anything like this before, shouldn't take this as a minor thing. It's only when you compare it to the endings of the previous Body-Snatcher films that you realize that the older films have a far more gruesome finale ? and one that sticks to mind!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guilty pleasure of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard nothing but bad comments by people about The Invasion when I went to see it. In fact the paper review I read this morning condemned it as laughable, poorly made, and just pitiful in general. So you can forgive me for feeling a little sceptical as I lined up to see the movie. The omens were all there, release delayed, actors refusing to promote the movie, two directors, a remake, flopped in America. In fact the movie looked destined to be hated. My first surprise of the day has to be when I walked into the screen and found it pretty nearly full, and my second surprise happened as I walked out of the movie and realised I actually had really enjoyed the movie quite a lot. In fact the movies reception has now really irritated me, the movie is not bad at all, sure its not perfect and there are a lot of flaws, but in terms of entertainment this is pretty solid. Okay I'll be honest and admit that the movie has problems, the script at times is clunky and you can tell there were two directors as the movie seems to have tow very different halves. However, the storyline remains perfectly intact and still has the ability to make you think Nicole Kidman is not wooden as critics has said she is, the action is very good and fast paced, and the movie never feels slow or dull. The Invasion has to be my guilty pleasure of the year as I am partly ashamed to like it quite as much as I do, and actually if I was honest this gets a pretty high 7/10 rating, but am aware I will scrutinised if I give it much higher. Truthfully I have no idea why this is hated as much as it is, and I really don't understand why it bombed as badly as it did in America. Perhaps the idiot critics or poor marketing caused a huge problem for the movie. But I would highly recommend the movie so long as you go in aware that it is essentially a piece of dumb entertainment.Nicole Kidman has come under a lot of scrutiny by the critics for her allegedly wooden performance. I actually found her performance to be pretty good, sure the odd bit of clunky dialogue makes her performance seem pretty bad, but look at the smaller moments, especially the moments she is among the infected, and you notice that she is delivering a very noteworthy performance. The scenes that she shares with Daniel Craig are actually quite touching, especially one moment where she reveals something to Craig. You actually care very much for her character and you are constantly rooting for her, this is a good thing as I have seen many movies recently where I want the lead character to drop down dead at the first opportunity. Daniel Craig, in his before Bond mode, delivers a pretty good performance, a shame that for a majority of the movie he has little to do. Thankfuly as the movie wears on he gets better bits to do and has one very impressive scene towards the end. He also has a good amount of chemistry with Nicole Kidman which makes me hope that the pair star together in a movie again at some point. From here on though the cast is a bit superfluous, Jeffrey Wright delivers a mediocre performance in a pretty pointless role, while Jackson Bond pretty much ticks all the right boxes for cute kid, although at times he is a little too cute and happy given the situation he is actually in.The critics have also condemned the pacing and way the movie is executed. This actually baffles me as I found the movie went by very quickly and never left me bored at all. The beginning delivers just the right amount of set up without ever letting the audience get bored, the middle section draws the audience in, and the final third just has the audience on the edge of your seat before they deliver an ending which actually does get you thinking quite a bit. The pacing is actually one of the best bits of the movie so unfortunately its just another example of the critics nit-picking. The execution of the movie is admittedly something I have a bit of a fault with. There were two directors for this movie, the first of the directors obviously being the better one at making this movie. The nice execution at the start of the movie shows the first director was more than capable, unfortunately the second director chooses to have loads and loads of jumpy cuts. Its the mixture of two directors that leaves us with some bizarre editing that switches between time in seconds. One minute its night, then its day, Carols' at work, then she takes her kid to school, the she is at work again. It gets less noticeable as the movie wears on but for me it was distracting at first. The script also makes the movie a bit faulty. Daniel Craig explanation of the virus has to be one of the funniest things I've seen all year, I honestly did not understand a damn word of that scene and nor did my friend who just burst out laughing in the scene. Thankfuly that is the worst bit of the movie and there are lines that are pretty good. Overall The Invasion is a pretty good and quite memorable movie. In many ways its this years Poseidon, slaughtered by the critics, not seen by masses of people and unfortunately regarded as a failure. Luckily for me I am one of the few people who can see why this movie should be watched and hopefully, in years to come, this movie may find the audience it does deserve.</fullReview>

Why make us go through so much if at the end all they're going to say is: "everybody took their vaccine and got cured, roll the credits" ? The cast of this movie is pretty good but unfortunately its biggest weakness is that it is not very scary. After some 30 years I still haven't forgotten the very last scene of the second version with Donald Sutherland pointing his finger at Brook Adams.

		<shortDescription>Impassive remoteness oddly tying into the film's structure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fourth cinematic incarnation of "The Invasion" based from Jack Finney's novel "The Body Snatchers," is an uneven film devoid of scares and emotional impact one might wonder whether its theme of an alien microorganism starting a populace of stoic individuals might have a bearing on the plot's structure.Nicole Kidman stars as Carol Bennell, a psychiatrist recently divorced from her husband (Jeremy Northam) and their son Oliver (Jackson Bond) is staying with Dad for the weekend. Meanwhile, in what seems to be a regular session, one of her patients acts agitated and claims her husband is not her husband. Carol prescribes her medication apparently dismissing it as nothing extraordinary. Soon, people start acting weird - like they're zombies except they're not dead - and it's clear an epidemic is at hand. Together with her best friend Ben (Daniel Craig) and a couple of other "survivors", they must dodge the infected and get to safe grounds.With the film a wild mishmash of low-key horror and a climax that's anything but restrained, it seems churlish to put all the blame on director Oliver Hirschbiegel's shoulders. As there are reports of the Wachowski Brothers and James McTeigue doing re-shoots for the film (obviously to make it more mainstream), "The Invasion" is a prime example of how studio interference can ruin a filmmaker's vision. Yet, with all this multitude of cooks spoiling the broth, it's hard to draw the line that would at least lessen the ambiguity regarding the rightful auteur. This makes it rather difficult to say whether the film's absence of real scares and lack of intelligent insight is out of Hirschbiegel's professional capacity.It doesn't help that newcomer Dave Kajganich's screenplay reduces Kidman and Craig's acting chops into roles that don't require much of a stretch except for them to look uncannily good even after a car chase. Ah, the power of Hollywood. Attempts to juxtapose the storyline to real-life perspective has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer and effectiveness of a politician's rhetoric. And I don't know what's more icky: Kidman having a man on top of her puke on her face; or Kidman uttering a line that goes something like, "You're my best friend, I don't want to lose that" after a kissing scene with Craig. Despite all that, one could go worse than watching "The Invasion." It's not frightening enough to earn a recommendation but it's not a howler either. If anything, it serves as an unfortunate reminder of how trying to be a lot of things can end up with nothing. In theory at least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I have not seen the previous two, and I'm not going to say anything about them from here on. I'm judging "The Invasion" as a stand alone movie.I liked this movie for many reasons. The characters were extremely convincing and identifiable that I actually cared about their fates. Secondly, although it wasn't too scary, it was pretty suspenseful at times and there were a few times when I jumped. And lastly, it had a very deep and thought provoking message that really had me thinking for awhile after I saw this movie, about the world and today's society. I don't want to spoil it, but it was interesting.Okay, now on to why I didn't like it. There were times when the movie sort of dragged although it didn't happen too much. Also, there is a visible boom Mic in the shots which was a little funny, but not too distracting, but definitely noticeable. They also could have ended it a bit better.Overall, the movie was pretty good and it does succeed in being entertaining and it leaves you with something after you're done seeing it. It's not a movie that you'll want to rush to the theaters to see, but if you ever get the opportunity, don't be so quick to pass it up. This movie is really good.And if you happen to not see it in theaters, it's definitely worth a rent when it comes out on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The other versions of this story make fantastic movies, and this one does NOT disappoint. In fact, I was ecstatically surprised. After seeing a few negative comments, mostly concerning this being just (yet) another treatment of the same story, I reluctantly went with a friend. (Really, there are so few options these days.) It was a genuine thriller in large part due to solid acting performances. Nicole Kidman is excellent at the center of the action for the length of the film, is very believable as a psychiatrist (I just saw it again with a friend of mine who actually IS one), and keeps the pace moving the entire time. I thought Daniel Craig was charming and a true supporting character as the love interest, Jeffrey Wright is always a joy to see and in this film served as an admirable catalyst/helper, and the KID was fantastic -- both cute and believable, starting with his terrified-kid scream in the beginning and culminating in his having to stab Nicole in the heart with an Epinephrine-filled syringe when she finally nods off. My doc companion did say that such an act would probably result in her immediate death, but that did not spoil my fun.The writing, photography, and directing worked very well, and I recommend this strongly for a great time at the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Invasion" displays more optimism about the fate of humanity than its classic predecessors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People who hate horror movies may enjoy the creepy new Nicole Kidman science fiction/horror thriller "The Invasion",with Daniel Craig, Jeremy Northam, Jeffrey Wright, and Veronica Cartwright. If statistics matter, "The Invasion" is the fourth take on author Jack Finney's cult 1955 literary chiller "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." This tense, low-key tale concerned space aliens quietly cloning human beings in a attempt to dominate planet Earth. No, you need not worry about any bug-eyed. tongue-slithering monsters lurching out of the dark to shock you and you won't have to wad cotton balls in your ears to muffle the screeching music that accompanies the violence. Not only does this version of "Body Snatchers" relies less on subtlety than the first three versions, but "The Invasion" also alters several things in the Finney novel that make it more palatable for people who prefer PG-13 movies, in other words, mildly scary, to full-blown, R-rated, pornographic, blood &amp; gore nightmares. Furthermore, this glossy looking Joel Silver production transforms Nicole Kidman with her blond hair and dark eyebrows into a bright-eyed action heroine.Anybody that has either read the novel or seen the influential "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (1956) with Kevin McCarthy, the 1978 Donald Sutherland &amp; Leonard Nimoy remake, and the 1994 Gabrielle Anwar &amp; Forrest Whitaker rehash will recall that the space aliens appeared only in human form. Armies of these replicated humans would place huge but harmless green plant-like pods without fanfare near people. When somebody dozes off, the pods twine a strand of its organism onto the person. As the person sleeps, the pod gradually draws the life out of the body and the pod grows into a flawless human replica. Meanwhile, the unsuspecting human withers away without a peep while the pod yields a life-like replica that nobody could in most instances distinguish from the genuine article. In Finney's novel, people complain on a country doctor that their friends and relatives don't seem like themselves. These pod people display no emotion and they act with one like mind. They wear placid expressions and seem dazed but not confused. "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" emerged as a metaphor for the paranoia that infected Americans like a plague during the Cold War years when most of us worried that Communist subversives were silently trying to take over America. Projectile spitting has replaced the pods in "The Invasion," and after a spat upon victim falls asleep does the cloning process begin. Actually, it looks like the bodies are wrapped in gauze. The alien spawn still travels through the icy vacuum of space to reach Earth and infect people, but this time the plague makes a more spectacular entry. The space shuttle 'Patriot' explodes upon re-entry and debris with a substance containing the virus litters the country from the Atlantic seaboard to the Mississippi River."The Invasion" uses computer-generated special effects, but most of the movie concerns average, ordinary, everyday things, objects, and people. Again, there are no scaly monsters in "The Invasion." Nevertheless, monstrous accurately describes the impact that this virus has on the human population. Furthermore, anybody who complains about this silent take-over is immediately labeled as delusional while a team of replicants begin to stalk them. As a result, it's really easy for the virus to replicate humanity and increase its numbers to epidemic proportions.Psychologist Dr. Carol Bennett (Nicole Kidman of "Cold Mountain") encounters this virus initially when a patient, Wendy Lenk (Veronica Cartwright of the 1978 "Invasion of the Body Snatchers"), confides in her that her husband isn't acting normal. Predictably, Carole doesn't initially attachment any significance beyond the ordinary to Wendy's words. Meanwhile, the virus affects other people. Some of them are pretty important, too. For example, Carole's ex-husband, Tucker Kaufmann (Jeremy Northam of "Happy, Texas"), works for the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and he is perfectly placed to pave the way for the virus when it contaminates him first and he leads the charge. After his replication, Tucker calls up Carole and demands to see his son, Oliver (talented newcomer Jackson Bond), who has never been separated from his mom. Meantime, Carole's friend Ben (Daniel Craig of "Casino Royale"), a medical researcher and physician, and Ben's buddy, Dr. Stephen Galeano (Jeffrey Wright of "Broken Flowers"), analyze a sliver of the virus that Carole brings to them. Eventually, the replicants themselves confront Carole. They defend their way of life to her. They assure her that their way of life is better because everybody is alike and they reside in complete harmony.The story takes place in the here and now and makes satirical use of current events. During a domestic scene at Carole's apartment, we hear a TV news program about the America withdrawing troops from Iraq because all hostilities have ceased. The social commentary about the human condition echoes Finney in his novel when one character argues that humans aren't human unless they possess the right to be different and engage in wars to celebrate those differences.Once mankind manages to expose the plague, our heroine must rescue her son from his replicant father. German film director Oliver Hirshbiegel, who helmed the brilliant 2004 Hitler movie "Downfall," mines the mother/son relationship for the suspense and tension inherent in its child-in-jeopardy plot. As it turns out, Oliver is immune to the virus. You can imagine the problem that this creates for the replicants who want to kill him. At that point, Nicole Kidman turns into an action heroine. She wields an automatic pistol and later we see her deliver a devastating blow to a replicant child that kills him. Her true moment of glory comes when she careens through downtown Washington swerving hysterically to dislodge the assailants clinging to her car."The Invasion" isn't the classic that its predecessors were, but it is still a good movie. The first three movies ended without a shred of hope in sight. The PG-13 rated "Invasion" exhibits more optimism about the fate of humanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>classic story, subtly political</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is not that unpredictable but actors certainly do a first rate work; characters are pretty likable and action scenes enjoyable (car chases, pc simulations of exploding cells and so on). Camera maybe lingers too much on Nicole Kidman's underwear and shapes but the whole story gets in my opinion to arouse the right dose of scare and passion. Wrote in the headline the movie is subtly political because it comments on humans being so indifferent and lacking of empathy. Different from other "Alliens" films, more modern, could say and passable on the whole. Daniel Craig is a decent actor, not more, and this time as well his performance is nothing special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Try not to fall asleep.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it was the intention of the filmmakers to make a movie about something horrible that happens to you when you fall asleep, and then try real hard to make the viewer get sleepy so they get scared. I can't think of any other reason that anybody would have allowed this dud to escape its pod. Why on Earth did we need this movie, especially when it brings nothing new to the table? All of the previously covered bases are touched on here in the new version: Someone says "My husband is not my husband", someone runs through traffic trying to flag down people and warn them, there's a mad grab for pills that keep people awake, etc. The one thing that's missing is anything creepy or scary.Nicole Kidman is the main character this time, a psychiatrist whose work allows her to hear the paranoid stories about people who are noticing something strange. But instead of pods duplicating human beings, it's just a case of alien flu that takes over a person's consciousness during sleep. Coincidentally, Kidman's young son is immune to the alien bug. She's also well connected enough that she has access to things like medical labs that can run some pretty amazing tests in a matter of hours.I guess bringing this story into contemporary times is what killed it; they tried to make it more subtle, and it failed. The movie throws in a lot of heavy-handed stuff, mostly about the war in Iraq, but then it just sort of stalls. It reminds us that atrocities are a part of being human, and then suggests that the alien flu is either our salvation or our death sentence. The movie is almost too subtle for its own good when it comes to the alien threat. In the previous films, there were weird seed pods that contained the potential new bodies of whoever happened to be sleeping in the vicinity. The process by which they converted their victims was bizarre and visceral enough that it resonated on some level. That's all been removed in this version, and all we get is...alien vomit. What's worse, the aliens themselves are real dopes. They aren't very bright, and have a hard time passing for human, even though they're in our bodies. One jerk thinks he's going to get over on Kidman when he comes to her house late at night asking to interview her for the census. Uh, yeah.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling, but not scary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, so I was lucky enough to catch the first screening of this film. It's an enjoyable movie, despite what the critics say, IF you forgo the fact that it's a remake, and not so much "horror" as action and thriller.If you're one for extracting life philosophies from movies, then you'll probably like it. However, if you want to see a movie that's gripping, terrifying, and will leave your heart pounding minutes after the film has ended, this is not for you.Positive: The acting By Nicole Kidman (who plays a high end psychiatrist, concerned most with her son and career) and Daniel Craig (a very very close friend and colleague who is in love with her) is superb. While it gets off to a rocky and slow first start, it gradually gets better and more tense as it goes on. The action scenes are very well done, full of stressful moments that make you anxious. This film explains the scientific background of the aliens more than its predecessors' in a very interesting way, giving you the inside look of how exactly the aliens work.Negative: A lot of ideas and themes were mentioned, but none really explored beyond that. You have a vague clue of how it started, but not where the aliens came from, why they came to earth, what happened to the space shuttle that made it crash, how the aliens got on the space shuttle in the first place; etc etc. You're left to pretty much guess for yourself. The ending, also, wasn't thorough. I think that one thing I disliked, also, was the fact that you find yourself sympathizing with the aliens, rather than humanity. It's a movie that wants to have a logical point, but it's not quite sure what it's trying to say.Overall, a philosophizing flick, portraying the dispassion and inhumane acts of the world with a twist, containing both negative and positive.7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well first of all i don't agree on some of the comments of this film!!! I thought it was really really good, and refreshing to see Nicole Kidman doing this sort of role rather than an Oscar film. I think if people give it a shot it would see a new generation of younger people knowing who Nicole Kidman is..... not that they shouldn't though she is a MEGASTAR. It was also good to go and see a film at the cinema that wasn't a sequel...threequal or fourqual. Well in my opinion go see it rent it but watch it, its good and at an hour and half long its not going to kill you now is it. Plus i am loving Nicole at the minute and want to see in more kick ass movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If I had a Nicole for every great performance by Kidman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unexpectedly, The Invasion is a jarring, terrifying remake of the 1956 and 1978 versions of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, managing to update the widespread panic of the 1950s - owing to the Cold War and the looming, constant threat of a sneak attack by those nasty Reds - to a new kind of fear, stylized and customized to fit the crazed paranoia of the 2000s. Nicole Kidman gives a pitch-perfect performance as a mother who must stay away for the sake of her uniquely immune child, added a jolt of adrenalin to an already frantic, uncomposed, and passionate treatise on how people react when things go wrong.It all starts with the US Space Shuttle exploding over the country during its return trip, scattering debris in a wide swatch from Dallas to Washington about 200 miles wide. People are warned not to touch the wreckage pieces, but do they listen? Not only don't they listen, but some of the stuff turns up on eBay - the second time this year the online auction service plays a role in a motion picture. But it seems that the debris isn't entirely benign, anymore, as it the astronauts had unwittingly been carrying an alien parasite on the outside of their craft.Soon, those who have touched the debris are contaminated. But they're not killed, no, they're merely turned into shells of themselves, sort of how a viewer feels after watching too much Fox News. (Hey, I kid because I love freedom fries.) I mean, everyone who's infected is at the same level of emotion, which is to say, none at all; no one even raises an eyebrow. Meanwhile, the grand ol' guvmint decides to get ahead of the curve by inoculating the bejeezus out of everyone - for free! Awfully nice of then, really, although perhaps the fact that they had all that serum should have been a warning sign of sorts.Carol Bennell (Kidman) is a trained psychologist who has a darling little son on whom she dotes; the father (Jeremy Northam) left them years ago but has suddenly shown up to reenter the boy's life. Coincidentally, he's also the head of the CDC, which is at the epicenter of this flu pandemic (I wanted so bad to say "epicenter of epidemic" there), so naturally he's got some of the bad alien crap on him - handed to him, somewhat ham-handedly, by someone who found it at a crash site. Soon there's a race against, well, not time, but something, as dear ol' dad and his zombie-like cohorts try their damndest to get to carol and Oliver.Joining the intrepid shrink is her best bud/wannabe lover Ben (Daniel Craig), who's a doctor or something and who has a serious case of the yabba-yabba-do-mes for Carol, but the feeling's not entirely reciprocated, on account of Carol doesn't want to lose the wonderful friendship they've built up (they live next door to each other, the carpool). Groan. Points for plausibility, but negative points for obviousness and needlessness. On top of that, there's an issue with the romantic chemistry between the slight Brit and the willowy Aussie; they actually SEEM more like they should be best buds and nothing more. When the kiss, the Earth doesn't tremble, it yawns and asks for another beer.But forget the romantic angle, and let's focus on the escaping-from-bad-people-who-look-like-our-friends angle. As with the first two filmings of the Jack Finney novel, people fall victim to the virus when they fall into sleep, as their cells are attacked during the body's REM cycle. So now you know the plan: Stay Awake. The very first scene in the movie slams this point home, as a raccoon-eyed Kidman scurries around a devastated drugstore, looking to score uppers and caffeine, anything to keep Morpheus or the Sandman from getting her. And she's damn convincing at it, too, which says a lot about Kidman's abilities; she's a tremendous actress who can play a variety of roles, which is in itself tough to believe of someone who's so elegant and luxuriant in appearance. Kidman's so good that her acting - I know, go figure - completely distracts you from the fact that she's gorgeous. Even when she's dressing down, or when she looks like a crack whore desperate for another fix - she radiates sincerity.Here's a question - how come, when people are infected by this alien virus, they gain the speed of, well, zombies? Shouldn't they be as fast as they were in the Before Time? The people here are one step away from full-on shambling, which makes you think it'd be fairly easy to get away from them - except that there are a LOT of them. In one scene, a good thirty of the mindless bastards jump on Carol's car to prevent her escape, and off she barely drives, losing more as she veers. Brought to mind the whole clowns-in-a-Volkswagen trick.The Invasion is spectacular, a realistic-seeming, fervent example of what might happen were the Earth to suffer a colossal pandemic. Remember, they've been talking about a flu pandemic for many years! Nicole Kidman is, as usual, awesome; you're as scared for her and her progeny as Carol is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was by far one of the best I've seen this year! I went into the theaters not really expecting anything but a few cheap thrills and some off the wall alien action, but was damn surprised when the movie turned out to be a question in itself. The movie dealt with human nature, and a huge handful of politics. The director used cliché scenes to his advantage while obtaining everything a movie needs, development, great acting, and an interesting plot.When the movie ended, I was in awe! I overheard a lot of chit chat about the movie and really didn't understand why the audience didn't like it. The reason was, because they didn't see it for what it was. Sure the film boring if you watched it and didn't get the inside meaning, but you could say the same thing about Fight Club, which in FACT is an amazing movie. This film has so much meaning that it's hard to fathom the idea.If you have the money, go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe how lame of a remake this is. This film basically tries to make some type of underlying statement that "Alienating of men/fathers and sons" in our society is a move for the future and blatantly makes the statement that this type of sexism is okay. We have a scene where lovely Nicole Kiddman's character makes some long speech about being a "Post-modern Feminist" to her fiancé's parents and they applaud this as being the right woman for him. . ? A male hater is the right woman for a man? Okay? The rest of the film has scenes where the Father's rights are shown as being unimportant and the well being of male children completely unimportant(to the extreme of showing Nicole Kiddman abuse a male child and playing this act for laughs). This film is completely playing towards a feminist/femi-sexist audience and is propaganda for abuse towards males.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Invasion is a very clever remake of the original 1953 movie, Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Not only did it have an all star cast including Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig but the cinematography was excellent built with vibrant colors and sudden flashes from scene to scene. The only problem in the whole movie were the two scenes where you could see the boom Mic in the shot. The movie was full of suspense and kept you hanging on to the edge of your seat until the very end of the credits (mainly to see the name of the boom Mic operator). This is definitely one of Nicole Kidman's greatest film to date and the chemistry between her and Daniel Craig made the film ever so much more exciting, it is no wonder they will be starring with each other again this winter in the theatrical rendition of The Golden Compass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've probably heard about "Pod People", a Phrase that made its way into the Public Consciousness meaning Folks without a Heart, Emotionless, Zombie like. The Descriptive and Pejorative Term gained Popularity because of Don Siegel's 1956 Classic Sci-Fi Paranoia, "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", from the Jack Finney's Novel "The Body Snatchers".In this, the Third Remake and the Fourth Film overall of the Story. Wait for it......There is No Reference and the Infamous Pods are non existent. Sure, If You have an Inkling to take on the Story One More Time there might be reasons to Tweak, Twist, or otherwise Meddle with a Classic. But the "Pod People", You don't Mess with the "Pod People".But Hey, You Say, this one is Postmodern Edited with very Quick Rhythm Cuts that Staccato, and Ain't that Cool, and how bout those Car Crashes? That's what the Thing Needed all along.Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig, in what could be said, one of Their Weak Moments, decided to Participate in this Troubled Production. While both are Capable, especially Kidman who manages Terrified Dishing Out Prescriptions and Fretting about Her Son, the rest of the Movie is Weak, Undignified, and Undeserving of Handling this Iconic Staple of Science Fiction. Some of the Blame is on the Producers, because after Completion, They showed No Respect for the Material, Messed with the Original Cut and Reduced it to a Run of the Mill Redo.Note...Do yourself a favor and watch any of the three previous versions before allowing this one to infect your introduction to the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shame it was butchered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A modernized take on the iconic science fiction novel 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', Oliver Hirshbiegel's version tells of how an alien bacteria lands on Earth via Shuttle crash and ends up infecting masses of people in their sleep, turning them into emotionless drones. A psychologist (Kidman) witnesses the changes to the world first hand, as does her doctor boyfriend (Craig) and her young son. Paranoia cranks up and the question of who is really who, or rather what, starts to creep in....Despite Craig's sleepwalking and the last 15 minutes screaming 'Reshoot' (handled by none other than James McTeigue and the Wachowskis to 'pump up' the spectacle), the 2007 'Body Snatchers' is actually fairly decent, and not as huge a turkey as its dismal reception may lead one to believe. First off, the positives; 'Invasion' is very well shot, often going for a hand-held approach with a lot of sombre lighting, making one feel like they are there in the midst of the action. What's more, because of the new angle of alien bacteria being less visually overt than past versions, this allows the film to have a few tense sequences as Kidman tries to go about daily life, and then later, escape, and you wonder who is really human and who isn't, especially during the subway and pharmacy scenes. What's more, veteran John Ottman's melancholy score is actually fairly unsettling, if a little droning with its use of synth and percussion, though still great at creating an uneasy air.Now of course, the film's poor reputation is not entirely unjustified; while everyone else, especially Kidman, do a decent job, Craig is phoning his performance in, often blank faced and speaking in a laid back monotone, and this is kind of a problem as it never enables us to really buy his relationship with Kidman's character (then again, most of the dialogue isn't that great anyway). As for the reshot ending, it definitely sticks out as the quieter, more subdued approach used for most of the film is thrown out for a big cross-city chase, zombie like pursuers who climb over cars, and even info-dumping narration that beats you over the head with 'well, the aliens are gone, but humanity did enjoy peace because of them'. Gee, I never could've worked that out just by, oh I don't know, watching the film and how the infection invasion was presented?! However, in spite of that, 'Invasion was able to hook me and keep my attention till the end of its meager 90 minute runtime. Are the earlier Body Snatchers better? More than likely, but honestly, I found myself shocked at how effective this one could be more often than not. A shame we'll never see Hirschbiegel's true version, but what we have here isn't necessarily an abomination either.</fullReview>

When her ex-husband kidnaps her son, she do whatever she must to save him and not to fall asleep.Although the plot was a bit vague in the middle of the movie, it wasn't bad. But there where some stupid things, weird dialogs and somethings where frustrating. Like when she had a gun, she just throws it away. I was almost yelling at the TV: DON"T DO THAT!And there was this one dialog where oliver and chen where talking about their dads.Oliver: I think there is something wrong with my dad.

		<shortDescription>In "Guinness Book of Records" for The Heaviest Botox and The Stupidest Message !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's judge it meticulously and fairly.The Good Points : 1_(Nicole Kidman)'s naked long legs at one shot.2_(Nicole Kidman)'s blue eyes.3_(Nicole Kidman)'s tender voice.4_(Denial Creag)'s presence and cuteness. By the way, this movie helped me to discover that he can act without goggling. According to his movies as James Bond, which I have watched first, I was about to believe that he considers "goggling" a synonym for "acting" ! 5_The possible satire about the coldness of today's humans which makes them the ultimate pods. Basically, writing the lead character as a psychiatrist raised a bitter irony; whereas the emotional freezing isn't an exceptional psychological case anymore; it's now an international pandemic. And there is a lot of truthfulness in that.6_Some action in the climactic sequence. The Bad Points :1_(Denial Creag)'s nerdy haircut. 2_(Nicole Kidman)'s haircut. It kept hiding her right eye, all along, provocatively ! 3_The originality. The main thing which differs The Invasion (2007) from its original, Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), and the 2 earlier remakes Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), and Body Snatchers (1993), is the profession of its lead character. Other than that, there is nothing more. Only some chases, and that's it. 4_The thrill doesn't have a character for itself. The movie runs blandly for most of its time. Not much of the events have an interesting impact. Aside from the script, the directing and the editing caused that; turning the movie into another watch-and-forget B movie !5_The matter of getting people infected with the virus, by simply vomiting in their faces, mirrored poor imagination before being disgusting. 6_The happy ending. It takes a lot from the deep foreboding sense of the story !7_(Nicole Kidman)'s botoxed face. She looked like a computer generated version of herself, or an extremely polished puppet. During some of her reactions, her eyes popped out, and her cheeks went down, in such a freaky way, making her the real horror of the movie ! Sylvester Stallone would have the same symptoms, 3 years later, in The Expendables, but Sly was never a hot chick once, therefore Kidman's horror is the freakiest.8_The meaning it chooses. The movie adopts a certain viewpoint, told by the character of the Russian diplomatist, about how violence is a very human deed, and stopping it means stopping the human's humanity ?!?!?!?! Yes dear viewer, this sci-fi thriller from Hollywood, retells the good old Body Snatchers story, yet to say something novel this time : The American dirty war in Iraq is sure dirty, but not doing it turns the human into a senseless, conscienceless and lifeless monster. So Violence is good. War is good. Otherwise a fascistic power, from outer space, would uproot our humanness, and recreate us as robots to end the civilization (sorry for not being able to type one million exclamation points!). I couldn't believe it when the heroine remembers the Russian diplomatist's words in the last scene in a way that says : "Welcome to violence; it is human". This is violently stupid to say the least ! So, when 6 good vs. 8 bad; then it is a bad movie, and in this case in hand; very dumb too ! Maybe someday "The Guinness Book of Records" will have this movie under the category of the heaviest botox and the stupidest message (if it hasn't done that already !). I think if they could have released it as The Invasion of Botox, it should have been more new, expressive, and rightly satirical !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Invasion" is the fourth version of the Jack Finney's novel "The Body Snatchers". And the worst one, despite of quite interesting performances of Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig."Invasion of the Body Snatchers" of 1956 still remains a classical science-fiction/horror movie, whereas the 2007 "Invasion" is an average horror film, with no climate, horrible script and predictable plot. There is nothing surprising in that movie, especially the laughable scene when Daniel Craig proves to be "one of them". While watching the movie, I could have bet with someone that this would happen!To sum up, I think that the film is watchable, but only in order to make some comparisons with 1956, 1978 and 1993 Body Snatchers. Besides, the "Invasion" may be found interesting by people who like the very "Snatchers"-history.</fullReview>

Another Hollywood attempt to brainwash people that were all evil, and the proposed conclusion is designed to make the viewer think "maybe we would be better off with something like that" Since there's no real antagonist in the movie, it's role is given to humanity also.When i say the movie was done well i am referring to the acting, the editing was horrible, the movie went and stopped in 50 different directions and never really developed any of them. We have no idea where the virus came from, how it functioned. It is obviously implied that the virus was intelligent, meaning something intelligent was controlling it, as infected people could read the minds of the others, why were certain people immune, who was running the virus, how was it cured, why did it erase memory yet the effects of it were 100% reversible, if the virus prevented memory then most of the world wouldn't know what happened, that makes no sense with how the movie ends... these are all directions the movie steeped into and steeped back out for a "suspense" scene. The movie attempts to lead the viewer to conclude we would be better if everyone had a lobotomy. now this has been rejected by an overwhelming number of doctors and it is no longer used in medicine, it was an old practice based on what may have been interesting at the time, but now i guess Hollywood is promoting it again, or a chemical version of it.ALSO the drug she kept referring to as "clonzapem" however she said it,.. the drug is clonazepam and is pronounced kloe-NA-ze-pam... You would think they would have looked a little bit..?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just can't get any idea or concept from this classical-remake one,even Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig brought a charming-so-called cast.Yes,I watched this totally because Nicole played the main role,and I really hoped she this time could bring something better - to prove that she was worthy of her Oscar Best Actress title.But,...again,the disappointment rose out of control.I tried to tell myself,Nicole is my favorite actress,while I realized she might,not a better enough actress.For this movie,what she did all the time,were smiling,or laughing,or just looked cool and opened her eyes as wide as she could.She walked like a model but lack of training,she frowned all the time,her role was a single mother with her dear son,and the story began with her ex-husband's touch with some unknown mysterious alien...This is not a Sci-Fi film,at least to me,it is more like a cult one,the story lines are very fuzzy,last screen I saw Nicole Kidman was yelling her son's name,next she was in office,drinking and thinking.Daniel's role is as strange as Nicole's,he just appeared in the car,talked with Nicole like they knew each other for long - they might be friends,or more.When Nicole's client talked with Nicole in office,something was revealed slowly - she said her husband was not her husband any more,he 'is different'.Then some people became strange and crazy in the street,Nicole felt the air smelled even different.Nicole's ex-husband,who 'slept,then became someone else,or remain the same',looked her in a cold smile.Till now,I finally got some ideas,that was,the first parts of this movie,that crashing aircraft,brought some out-space cells or viruses into our dear earth,everyone who had contacted with them will evolve or change during the deep sleep.When they awake,they seem to be the same person,but the tempers are all gone.What if all people in the planet,become a one that won't argue,won't smile,won't anger,won't cry,won't show any emotion a normal person supposes to have,then what will the world become?No war?Just peace?But no viva forever,right? Nicole's boy was the exception in this alien virus storm,he ammuned to that virus,so Nicole must take him and run away,to some place may be safe.So the story is - peaceful life - virus - infected people - ammune boy - infected guys wanted this boy die - desperate mother ran away with her son - be rescued - all infected ones seem be healed...Maybe I should watch its original version and can understand deeper 'bout this story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Your average flick.Pros: 1. It's there. Considering an overall scarcity of good SF productions, it's an added value.2. Editing and camera work.3. "What makes us human" thread. A little oversimplified, yet makes it worth it.Cons: 1. Simple and safe Hollywood craft. "You seen one, you seen all of 'em". No incentive to come up with something at least bordering with originality.2. Was Kidman the only human actor here? It's almost like everyone else on the set had already been "turned" when they started filming. She really outshines other characters but not because she was so great, but rather because everybody else was so bad.3. Script/story inconsistencies: The "chaos" was either local or worldwide. TV broadcasts want you to believe the latter, but what you see does not concur.4. Standard stupidities, like when the CDC guy touches the 'goo thingie' with his bare hands despite him wearing a protective suit 3 minutes earlier.Overall: Genre lovers and Kidman admirers should be somewhat satisfied. Pity they did not try to dig deeper and went for easy "solutions".</fullReview>

The script awfully weak, with only one dialog worth remembering Russian VS Psychiatrist over dinner.Who noticed how the heroine graduated into a serial killer status overnight? Starting with his son's Asian friend to a massacre shooting in the grocery store. The plot losses it as the chopper conveniently appears just as everyone is catching up on her. Special EFX, my 2nd year animation student brother has done better for his semester projects. All in all most characters were introduced and removed with no purpose.

I totally adore Daniel Craig, and Nicole is fine too, but this remake definitely fell into the category of "totally unnecessary" for me. The updated story is fine, but the cinematography is really muted and blah, and the mood of the whole thing goes from what was a kind of fun crazy genre movie, into this really serious, heavy, "oh my gosh the child is in danger" type of vibe, which I find just tiresome. Please Hollywood, stop trying to take great genre material and turn it into heavy high-concept fru-fru meaningful academy award bait, it doesn't do anyone any service. Having said all that, I guess there are worse remakes out there. Why the "Total Recall" remake happened, I can't even guess. If you like watching Daniel Craig though, this won't ruin him for you. He does a fine fine job as always. Nicole I always tend to find a little wooden and unbelievable, and she's no different here, but also no worse than usual.</fullReview>

And while the beginning is nice with its build up, in the end it does not deliver. It works only in places which makes it not a total wreck, but not a good movie either</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remakes of The Invasion of the Bodysnatchers are now giving diminishing returns ever since the seminal re-imagining that starred Donald Sutherland in 1978.Here we have Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig in a story where an alien virus turning humans into possessed, monotonous beings that does bring end conflict and brings global peace.Of course the central premise of the plot is that something is not right, people are behaving differently. Kidman must stay one step ahead of the Bodysnatchers and protect her son whilst being aided by Craig.The film suffered from re-edits, re-shoots and other production problems with the film being re-written and another director stepping in for the post production work. It is a surprise that we have a coherent film and it works as a thriller, not overlong but also not a patch on the first two Invasion films.</fullReview>

Even viewers who are sadly unfamiliar with the classic 1956 film or its very good 1978 remake will see it all coming because the story has been done many times, through the remakes as well as the ripoffs. I can imagine that if you are very young or have lived under a rock, you might find this a watchable movie. I cannot imagine you will find it a good one, however. There's no suspense, no terror, no thrills. It's all boring, tired, and predictable. None of the performances stand out and the direction is uninspired. Skip this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***May possibly contain some spoilers*** Concise review: At best, this film passes the time.Detailed review: Where to begin? Well, I was tired, and came home wanting to relax in front of a good film. I turned on the TV and noticed that there was a "sci-fi horror film" on at 9pm. Great. Unfortunately it turned out to be "The Invasion".Plot: If you have seen the original (and best - it is a classic) "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" then this will be familiar. Something from outer space descends to Earth, infecting people, resulting in changing behaviour etc. Emotions vanish, there appears to be a conspiracy, who knows what is going on!!! None of these aspects are covered particularly well in this dreadful remake.Cast and acting: Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig can act well when required. Presumably, therefore, the fault in this sorry piece of cinema lies with the scripting and directing. Both Kidman and Craig are initially quite convincing, but they both appear to become bored and underwhelmed as they drift aimlessly through the film.Exciting moments: To be honest with you, the film was so dull and lifeless that I changed channels to watch the news after an hour. I didn't bother to watch the end. If you have any sense then you won't either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is more a suspense / action movie than a "pure science fiction movie" In fact, the alien virus arrived on Earth in a sloppy screenplay (not so much looking for another way some "big facts" of reality). The virus came so simple as the crash of the space shuttle; source timidly criticized handling (manipulation) of the introduction of the pandemic, the virus then, only serves to justify the action highlighted in this film and to feed the beautiful and idealistic but still simplistic poor and childish main idea defended in the movie . "Take any newspaper, for better or worse we are again human. Imagine a world (...) where every crisis will not lead to atrocities. Imagine a world where human beings cease to be human. "And the way to end the movie with this resumption of dialogue makes us feel too" big "release researched which is weak and unsuccessful (and here the viewer is going to say wow! yeah!).An allegory that raises fears today: terrorism and infections. This view is interesting but the film is content just to quote and make it appear he did not dig, he just basically favors the action that follows.An introduction a little bit too long for the development of the "depth" of the main plot, one or two scenes are too much or maybe too long. There is a false rhythm.Despite a final cut not always wise, as the pre introduction to intensify only the announcement of the film's title, or as the use of a fitting cross cut on events close in time and experienced by the same characters, and may eventually need confuse the understanding of history, this figure of speech completely abandoned when the action is more intense where there the linear reading of events is used. Often artificial cut that gives us the feeling that this cut is just made to be highlighted and do not necessarily serve the story. However the desired action of the film, the heart of the film, is generally well done, its ambiance is good and like its main objective to keep the viewer well "awake."Atmosphere that is reminiscent of the sci-fi movies of the 50, of course as "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (Don Siegel) that this is the fourth remake, or even "War of the Worlds" (Byron Haskin ) ... or more recently "signs" (M. Night Shyamalan) by the dominance of sensations.The actors are empty flat, it really does not attach to the characters except may be for heroin well played by the lovely and good looking Nicole Kidman who takes a lot of the movie on his shoulders.A very poor film which can be O.K if you want the thrill of the action, otherwise you can go your way without regret.jeliosjelios@hotmail.fr</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unthrilling remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don Siegel's original adaptation of Jack Finney's Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, predicated on cold war fears of communist takeover, was an early masterpiece in the urban paranoia genre. Philip Kaufman's 1970s update was utterly chilling, and a worthy remake. I haven't seen Abel Ferrara's Body Snatchers. so I can't comment on it. But I have now seen Oliver Hirshbiegel's offering, and I must say that it doesn't add much.OK, it offers an immunity subplot tied in with the wrinkle of the sex-swapped protagonist being driven by the need to look out for her son, but these elements don't seem to add very much to the narrative drive. Sadly, I never really cared for any of the people here (except for one short moment when mother and son are reunited), which is a distinct disappointment when I consider how strongly I rooted for Kevin McCarthy, Dana Winter, Brooke Adams, Donald Sutherland et al.Also, I think the ball was dropped in terms of the actual replacement mechanism - a DNA modification doesn't have anything like the visceral horror of pod duplicates being grown.Nicole Kidman does a really weird and distracting thing with her mouth a lot of the time.If you're going to produce a remake you must, at least, make sure that it offers something which engages the viewer over and above the original. No such luck here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The earlier versions of this old chestnut from Jack Finney in his serialized novel, first published in Collier's Magazine, were somewhat superior.The best of the Invasion of the Body Snatchers was Don Siegel's 1956 edition with Dana Wynter and Kevin McCarthy. Hollywood seems hell bent to remake good movies, repeatedly, with inferior copies. The stars in this latest version are fine as are the production values but the script seems somehow lackluster and tired compared to the freshness of the original. The original offered an entirely new concept in science fiction and a superb comprehension by an extraordinary director.The modernization of the alien life form into a microbe is an inferior concept and lacks the impact of the original, a separate, plant-like creation from some mysterious alien world from unknown space.There is also no real social parallel today as once was when subtle but palpable societal changes created by the cold remoteness of the then, new nuclear age fear had moved into a once comparably innocent world where global epidemic was only partially felt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We learned with The Omen remake and Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone that to stick too closely to the original source material can be the death knell of a celluloid work. We also learned through a million other remade works that to stray too far from the expected story line can have the same result. This work contributes to that rule. The story found herein is vastly different from that which we have come to expect from five previous versions of the work. This fact is only exacerbated by the hiring of Oliver Hirschbiegel, with no notable works to his name and it seems this work will not add his first blockbuster or even noticeable work to his resume.Nicole Kidman is marvelous and I rate her performance somewhere around a 9/10, and so is her co-star. Daniel Craig? No, he's not the co-star. I don't care what the billboards said! Jackson Bond is her co-star. That is one enigmatic kid and his performance is right up there at a 9/10 with Ms. Kidman's! And Daniel Craig contributes the stellar performance we have come to expect from our newest Bond, but the sum of these three important and worthy elements did not a fantastic film, make.We then look for the reason. I think the reasons have already been touched upon. The story one finds herein is not the story one expects from an Invasion of the Body Snatchers remake, but runs rather like a possible sequel. They're back and they operate differently this time. That would have answered most complaints moviegoers have concerning this movie. The hiring of a competent director could possibly have made a difference. Otherwise, I believe that a screenplay which more closely embraces the original material would have been most fortuitous.All in all, I enjoy it nonetheless. It is edgy, suspenseful, and well enacted even if the finished product falls far short of the sum of its superior parts. It makes a great Friday/Saturday night's viewing although it seems to me that it is far less graphic than the old original 1950's version. Odd, that.It rates a 6.7/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While in no way a superior film to the 50's classic Invasion of the Body Snatchers or even as gritty and genuine as the 1978 remake, this version of the basic premise of an alien life form coming to our planet, somehow invading our bodies when we sleep, and retaining the outer shell but wiping emotion from the personality palette has much merit. It is stylishly made, fast-paced, tensely scripted, and generally well-acted. Nicole Kidman, she of the most amazing eyes in film, does a very credible job as the lead who, while going through custody issues and divorce personally, now sees patients in her psychiatry practice saying they are married to different people - not physically but different nonetheless. This is a modern retelling complete with computer web searches and text messages as intricate parts of the plot and its movement. I guess the days of chasing someone without a phone are gone. Thank God for the 70s and all those years when no signal or a phone malfunction were not the best the writers could come up with. Sorry I digress. While The Invasion makes many departures from the source material, at its heart it is still about not being able to trust those that you know or think you know as well as preying on our fears of bacteria, viruses, and germs. It is an exciting, flawed film but delivers what it promises and is entertaining and enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tense at times science fiction horror that throws in some clumsy metaphorical content but still works on a basic level.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think The Invasion works best as entertainment, perhaps disposable entertainment but entertainment none-the-less. Its attention to metaphors and politically driven dialogue and events that happen that could be compared to larger scale, real life happenings are all there but perhaps feel a little thrown in. But while the film tries to elevate itself above the level of what it is, ie; a genre picture about the end of the world or 'monster from another planet', what it does do right in an impressive manner is get the basics for its respective genre correct.The Invasion is a remake; it's a remake of a film that can quite easily be classified into a specific 'type'. The path it follows is of the horror with science fiction tie in formula, something you'll only really enjoy if you're a fan of that hybrid. The one thing The Invasion has going for it for the bulk of its runtime is its own personal spin on the bad guys of the piece. We've all seen zombies or the un-dead or 'the infected' in recent hits 28 Days and Weeks Later, respectively, but here the pinch that makes The Invasion slightly more intriguing than your average survival horror genre is that the antagonists are in no way obviously hostile.It seems like a small thing to have tilt a film into the realm of the positive but in the hands of experienced European director Oliver Hirschbiegel, the little idea actually works quite well, having practically every supporting character not to mention extra come across as very intense and intimidating. This is the sort of survival horror that will not relegate the viewer to barrages of gun fights and fast edits alá a Resident Evil film (although the third one of that trilogy showed some encouragement) but will instead have its feature characters actually have conversations with the 'infected' enemies of the film. While the familiar routine is to run away, hide or merely open fire on beasties in this sort of genre (sometimes all three?), The Invasion has the villains talk back; negotiate with the heroes; talk them into joining them and actually pitch an argument as to why they're superior.This brings us onto the entire argument many will have with the film in terms with what these monsters are and what they say, with special attention to what it could mean. The film's primary metaphorical meaning could be that once the entire world has been taken over by these germs inhabiting our own bodies, equality will be as one with everybody the same thus eliminating any more wars or global conflict and such. This is actually brought up early on at a dinner between several characters, one of which being the protagonist Carol Bennell (Kidman) as she listens to a Russian talk about this very ideation ? the fact that he is Russian could allow us to read into Communist parallels and the similarities those have to the world the 'body snatchers' would create if they took over every one of us.But like I said, the political slant and metaphorical meanings to be read into the psychology of certain people is a little heavy handed. Carol and the Russian sit at that dinner table and deliver their banter in a manner that the film demands. They are not there through chance, they are there because the film wants to come across as smarter than it should be and places them there purely so they can exchange the dialogue they do ? it's purely for our benefit. Then there are the frequent signs and advertisements cleverly inserted into the background of most scenes with the words 'take the step' plastered all over them, thus reminding everyone within the film to go through with it but since they are not in the foreground, it affects the film watching audience in a subliminal manner ? you'll notice it if you look hard enough but it feels like a clumsy insertion of further metaphorical content.But apart from all this and the main reason I did enjoy the film is because of its eeriness and its attention to an uncomfortable atmosphere. The chief enemies in the film can be interacted with and a particularly good scene is when Carol must pretend to be one of them in order to get by without capture. The Invasion is a text book example of a good set up in the horror infused with the science fiction genre before developing its initial ideas into thoroughly tense situations, such as the arresting of innocents then ready to be transformed and the escape in the subway train to the station in which Carol must act inconspicuous.While The Invasion is not a great film, it does satisfy a basic need to be entertained and it does get pulses racing now and again given the nasty subject matter on screen. The idea that the world is being overrun is not a new one but it's effective when done correctly and that atmosphere of no hope is nicely put across here. The chases and manners in which characters deal with certain situations is tense and somewhat dramatic with less emphasis on action through attacking and more on action through thinking. As far as these un-dead survival pictures go, The Invasion isn't too bad.</fullReview>

Don't compare it with what she did in The Hours. Come on-it was Oscar! I have not watched the previous version in 1970s before, so I barely know anything about the whole story, even the so called virus. And I think that is the reason why I can totally get into the movie. Despite the too tidy and quick ending, the movie tells the story smoothly. Due to the outstanding editing and camera angle, it makes you nervous and thrilled. And at the same time, The Invasion can lead people to think, more or less. If you treat this movie simply as a "pop corn movie" to entertain yourself, it really works. Come on, we know it was casted by Nicole and Danniel, but it doesn't mean that it must be another Gone With The Wind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not an awful script, and Kidman is great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd read and heard of all the universally rabid critical panning of this film. So I expected something pretty bad, something I'd turn off after 20 or 30 minutes. And, as usual in such circumstances, was pleasantly surprised. The film's not only "not too bad" but for the most part, it's pretty good.The script seemed to be singled out for special condemnation, but I don't see why. It was far superior to the risible dialogue in, say, "Awake", and it had a stab at saying something about the nature of humanity, about the effects of human diversity, about individuality versus the common good. There's a great line towards the end. The alien-virus infected people have take over running the place, wars have ended, poverty is being addressed, AIDS vaccines are being distributed to Third World countries, then the humans take over again. The doctor who discovered the virus vaccine is entering a building when a reporter screams at him, Is the crisis over? Is humanity back in control? The doctor turns and looks at her. Pick up a newspaper, he says.Sure, some of it's clumsy, and it gets a bit over the top. But it has one great asset that most films don't have. It has Nicole Kidman. As usual, she carries the film, and as usual, she's fantastically good. From the start, you're not seeing Kidman, you're seeing the character she inhabits. Beautiful and all as she is, she's not afraid to look like she's coming back from a 5-day bender. Everything I see her in, from "The Others" and "Birth" to more recent outings like "The Golden Compass" and "Margot At The Wedding" just stamps her as the outstanding actress of the present day, head and shoulders above even the magnificent Cate Blanchett or Naomi Watts. I'm amazed that the skills of this brave, subtle, complex and fragile actor aren't lauded to the skies. If the Academy Awards had any credibility, she'd have at least 3 Oscars on her shelf.The film does run off the rails at the end, possibly the result of interference. In the space of a couple of days, while Kidman tries to stay awake, the virus infects tens of millions of people, they take over the show and dramatically affect the course of world history, then just as suddenly, a vaccine is discovered, somehow these millions of people are vaccinated, and the humans are back in control. What's more, none of the infected folks can remember anything, and nobody mentions it to them. Wars have restarted, and all the folks killed during the infection are regarded, presumably, as having mysteriously disappeared.As well, I'm always amazed about how ordinary, professional, suburban family types can acquire such instant dexterity with weapons. Maybe that's a uniquely American thing.But until then, the script, for the most part, made a decent attempt at explaining potential plot holes and anomalies, such as Kidman's attempts at warding off her pending metamorphosis. The car chase scene was terrific, well-staged and one of the best of its kind, but, of course, totally divorced from reality. But heck, this is a thriller, an action-adventure movie. Don't all films of these genres stretch credibility to the max? Overall, I found this highly watchable and thoroughly enjoyable. The ending drags it back, but Kidman's worth a point or two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not completely unfair to compare this to its previous counterparts, each one reflecting social issues of their time, I thought this remake was the least cerebral. Too much unrealistic situation coincidence going on in this movie to give you pause, plus no scare factor really. There was enough tension, and with the help of Kidman's performance, to keep you interested but ultimately I felt by the end I hadn't thought much and the events that moved the story along didn't give me that feeling of isolation or paranoia as the first two versions intended. It seemed that by the end they were just trying to button things up and very contrived. Feeling my mind stray even as I write about this movie I'll keep it short. It's worth renting if your other option is the Scorpion King.</fullReview>

There is NO such name in Russia. Yuri - yes. (Remember Yuri Gagarin - the first man in outerspace). And that Jew family name ? highly unlikely for the Russian ambassador; - judging by the video messages Caroll Bennell (Nicole Kidman) gets from her son the movie pictures the time somewhat after the year 2005 or so but the "notorious Russian ambassador" refers to Czechoslovakia which ceased to exist in 1992, but who cares?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Spoiler~The Invasion is a film I've been interested in since the project was first announced. I own three different versions of this classic story (Don Siegel's, Philip Kaufman's, and Abel Ferrara's). I love all three versions for different reasons. They all bring different things to the table. Where this latest version fails is that what is being brought to the table is too Hollywood for it's own good. We all know the story of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. If you don't, go see the original film. This time around we have very capable actors in a mediocre script. Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig (the new 007), Jeffrey Wright (the new Felix Leiter), and Jeremy Northam are all fantastic stars. Oliver Hirschbiegel, who directed the wonderfully suspenseful The Experiment, seemed to be the perfect director for this project. However, the studio supposedly took the film away from him and re-shot some sequences and added new material. I can't really find anything official, but apparently James McTeigue and the Wachowski brothers were brought in for these new scenes. I can't believe that those talented individuals came up with this totally formulaic film. This version has the dumbest twist that certain people who've had a certain strain of the chicken pox are immune to becoming "pod people." This is not really explained in any great detail, and that's probably for the best. It's all too coincidental and convenient. Also, the social commentary that may or may not present in the other films is thrown in the viewer's face this time around. And don't get me started on the upbeat ending where everyone gets cured. While, no, it's not a terrible movie, The Invasion is not going to please anyone familiar with the original films. The chase sequence is fantastic and there are some suitable creepy moments. However, there is nothing here that compares to Donald Sutherland's last image in the Kaufman version. Go watch the earlier films.Note for genre buffs: Veronica Cartwright also starred in the second adaptation in 1978.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I like Kidman, and I really wanted to like this movie, but it is hard!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Curiously, I have never seen the original "Invasion" (Of the Body Snatchers). This is a modern remake, with telephone video messaging. But something about the script and the editing, I had a very hard time becoming "engaged" by this film.The movie starts with a tragic space shuttle re-entry, breaking up and burning up, scattering debris from Dallas to Washington, DC. (I don't know why it would be taking that path, however...) Apparently some of the debris has organisms embedded that are highly resistant to both extremes of heat and of cold, so they survive re-entry. When they get onto a person, they are able to thrive and multiply when a chemical made during R.E.M. (rapid eye movement) sleep. An infected person acts more calm all the time, and wants all others to be infected too so that there never will be conflict or war again.Nicole Kidman is a psychiatrist Carol Bennell, divorced with a small son. Daniel Craig is her boyfriend, a doctor, Ben Driscoll. Jeremy Northam is her ex-husband, Tucker Kaufman, who becomes infected early.Much of the drama involves Bennell trying to avoid becoming infected, and as important, to see that he son is not infected, as she witnesses all around her turning into sorts of zombies. It just all came off as "B" movie to me.SPOILERS: It turns out her son has natural immunities, so he is not at risk. She figures out that she has to stay awake, avoid R.E.M. sleep, and she does that for the most part. Eventually scientists figure out an antidote, because the organism is very fragile and easy to defeat with medicine, which they end up spraying by plane over large areas. The world is saved!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first, the film seems to pay the obligatory homage to the first two adaptations of The Body Snatchers ("my husband is not my husband", the hysterical protagonist from the last film running through traffic) but it becomes obvious that this flick just lacks originality. At times the editing is irrational. Our hero is scrambling through her frontyard and the next cut shows the villain in the kitchen telling her that it's too late to escape.Also, I couldn't help but cringe at the "Man of Superficial Wisdom With An Accent", who shows up in many crappy films.The last thirty minutes of the film is thrilling, but the ending: ruined. It would have been better off paying another direct "homage" to the first two Body Snatcher films.I'll give it four for it's thrilling sequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could aliens save us from ourselves?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien invasions have been portrayed in usually negative light. They come to destroy our cities, wipe out humanity, or at best enslave us. One might call them the ultimate villain humanity could ever face in any genre in that the aliens always seem to have a great advantage in which humans can only make up with fate/luck and determination. That is why The Invasion is somewhat unique. Instead of simply trying to destroy us, what if an alien life form could actually help us even though the world as we know it would still end? Dr. Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman) is dedicated to both her son and her psychiatric practice. A strong willed and independent woman, Dr. Bennell can only feel resentment when her ex-husband Tucker (Jeremy Northham) suddenly announces that he wants visitation rights with their son Oliver (Jackson Bond). However, Tucker remains Oliver's father and she agrees to allow him access to him even though she finds the very idea insulting.However, it becomes apparent to Dr. Bennell that something else could be very wrong with those around her. A long term patient named Wendy (Veronica Cartwright) has an unusual complaint about her traditionally abusive and threatening husband. No longer the man he used to be, he is distant and seemingly not himself. A case made even more clear when he strangles the family dog and show little remorse or concern over his actions.Carol is rightly concerned and attempts to guide Wendy as best as possible. However, she notices that other people are not acting like they should be. The city streets during broad day fall silent as people suddenly stand as if made of stone and utter not a single word, the police show little interest in the death of a woman run down, and one of Oliver's close friends seems distant himself towards everyone around him. Oh, and there is the matter of that strange "skin" Oliver finds during a Halloween party.Ben (Daniel Craig), a medical doctor who is a close friend (if not love interest for Carol), studies the strange "skin" and later passes it on to Dr. Galeano (Jeffrey Wright) who is also confused by it. By the time that he does understand what it is they are all looking at, it's too late. The world suddenly finds itself threatened and humanity now faces it's greatest challenge yet.Or does it? World peace, nuclear weapons being abolished, poverty being eradicated, and an end to violence, are a few of the consequences of having the alien life form control hundreds of millions of people. Individuals may lose themselves and act like mere drones but the world has never been better off. The aliens have ironically done what man has never been able to do which is to bring lasting peace. Tucker, who of course controlled by the aliens (and perhaps one of the first to be infected after coming into contact with the debris from the shuttle Oklahoma), asks Carol if what "they" are doing is really wrong. Tucker in essence argues that "they" have made a world for everyone. Except for those that can't fit in such as Oliver whose medical history make him immune to alien take over. However by the time that the conflict between Carol, Ben, and Dr. Galeano and a few other minor characters and the aliens comes to life, the plot slowly fades out to a rather traditional ending of humanity defeating the invasion and returning to the status quo. But one must think, as Carol does in the final scene, of what was really lost and gained. Is a world filled with violence and hate really one that is better off than a world where one's individuality is lost forever? The Invasion won't win any awards or perhaps even be remembered in the long run. Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig may not have been the best choices for such a movie but they managed to help create an otherwise unique sci-fi story. However, one should watch The Invasion not just to enjoy another alien movie but to have a rather unique take on the question of the individual in relation to the "group" as a whole.7/10</fullReview>

Before I saw this movie I checked the rating on it on IMDb as always and I was surprised to see it had only been rated a 6/10! I've got to admit I don't know which actress could have done a better job of Nicole's role then her, she put plenty of feeling and emotion into it and once again I think it set the right mood.I think Daniel Craig could have done a better job in the acting though, but towards the end he was chilling.If you want to see a movie thats a bit flightplan- ish cross Zombie-ish see The Invasion!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong - I love the X308 Jaguar. With timeless styling, a sumptuous limousine like interior and near sports car handling it could be considered the epitome of the design principles of space, pace and grace. But however good it is, when you have talent like Kidman and Craig in your movie and the best thing in it is still the car you know that you're sailing into somewhat rocky waters.I'll be honest and say that I picked this pretty much at random at the cinema with no idea it was a 'bodysnatchers' remake. That wouldn't have put me off, but blimey what a disappointment it was. It's hard to pin where the fault was. The script seemed very spartan, the characters one dimensional, and the pacing just felt pedestrian. What I do know is that my watch was getting PLENTY of attention. My guess is that if it wasn't for the two stars I wouldn't have seen this movie. Replace either one of them and it's got 'direct to video' written all over it. Hell, they should have just gone for Scott Bakula and made sure of it! Miss Kidman, as always, looks fabulous - but it's just not enough. One to avoid I'm afraid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Invasion of the Melodramatists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kennethy Tynan, the British theater critic, raved about Don Siegel's original 1956 Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Body Snatchers, you'll remember, is the name reserved for those who snatch cadavers for physicians to learn anatomy on, in 19th century England. Boris Karloff played one in a forties movie.The Invasion is the third remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. This one is a little bland. Nicole Kidman is the lead. In a surprising opening tease, Kidman is seen rifling a pharmacy for prescribed drugs. The audience learns moments later that Nicole is a divorced psychiatrist, with a physician boyfriend and an ex who works for the Center for Disease Control.Like all grownup films now, the family is the focus of the film. Nicole is having the usual dust ups with her ex (Jeremy Northam) when a returning Columbia space vessel enters American airspace with a new toxic virus on board. Slowly, the virus begins to infect Americans. "People are being replaced!" said someone in the first remake. Well, not exactly. This film isn't that literal. There are no pods for people. The people themselves transform into obedient zombies. Removing the pods removes some of the great fear of the first three Invasions. For the most part, folks have just come down with a virus. It grows a frosty film on one's body but can be peeled off in the initial stages. One must not fall asleep once contacted by the virus. Big Deal!Very quickly, Nicole's young son Oliver (Jackson Bond) has contacted the virus. Boyfriend Daniel Craig, looking more relaxed and natural than in his recent dull turn as James Bond, wants to help. He has his friend Dr. Stephen Galeano put the virus under the scope to see what its all about. Meanwhile, Nicole's Ex has contacted the virus and the whole CDC is now on the Virus Invasion Rollout Team.Oliver becomes a pawn between Nicole and her Ex, in the fight for dominance of the 'new species.' Oliver is infected with the virus, but unaccountably - in a turn reminiscent of the recent 28 weeks Later- falls asleep, but is NOT transformed into a 'pod person.' Galeano realizes Oliver's blood could be the template for a vaccine to defeat the virus and the growing Invasion Army.Nicole and Olvier escape to a pharmacy and convenience store, where, since she's been hit by the virus too, she injects herself with a serum to keep her awake and instructs Oliver how to plunge a syringe in her heart if she appears to have fallen asleep. The Pharmacy is stacked to the ceiling with offensive product placements.Nicole's Ex and the CDC Team in charge of spreading the virus, have now realized Oliver's blood could defeat them and have launched a search for him. Nicole's boyfriend Daniel Craig is too ineffectual to do anything but set up more opportunities to scare women in the audience already finding their own husbands and boyfriends seated next to them, wanting as saviors.Eventually, Oliver is snatched from the Jaws of the Invaders, a serum is created. The world is saved. But worse, all the bad guys have gotten the serum too, and are ordinary law-abiding folks again. Its as if the whole incident didn't take place. This is a mistake. Bad guys should be consigned to oblivion and destruction. There is a possible setup here to ditch her ineffectual boyfriend Craig and return to her odious ex-husband. Its as if we've watched a Douglas Sirk weeper about a family stricken by the flu virus, and all the emotional torpor that follows in its wake. Its like Freddy from Elm Street raking you with his claws, but leaving no marks.A side note: I noticed the film was released at the exact moment the Columbia space vessel was returning to earth, with NASA churning up drama about a hole in the Columbia spacecraft to attract public attention. In the future, all films will be timed with real events taking place in reality to heighten the fear and the drama. May the best publicists- Studio or NASA- win!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best remakes of a great classic , period</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the latest in the remake series of Jack Finney's The Invasion of the body snatcher's, and in my opinion this one is the bests out of all of them, when Invasion of the Body Snatchers came out in 1956 it instantly became a sci-fi horror cult classic marking it's place as one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time. The Invasion does not fall short of brilliance, albeit they change the story around a bit to suit 20st century audiences, they changed how the virus came to earth, in the 1956 version it was pods, in this one it was a space shuttle that was carrying spores that pass form human to human.But the Invasion is not a terrible sci-fi horror film, it amazingly quite well done, considering the talent this film drew( Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, Jeffery Wright &amp; Jeremy Northam.) it's a stellar cast for a stellar movie.The Invasion doesn't hurtle trough it's story, it takes it time to explain and tell it trough a mild pace that quickly speeds up as the story progress, this film explores another aspect of an attempt to take over the world, where as most films that takes the same approach begin it with a mass alien invasion of our planet, this film strives from that and approaches a more quieter and less destructive approach to taking over our world it follows a virus that while you sleep takes over your body and controls you, with that said The Invasion is a run for your life, cover your eyes Sci-fi horror film that you can not afford to miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Third (!) remake of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (This time called INVASION, probably because the producers figured no one would pay to see another remake of that film &amp; tried to deceive the audience by dropping "OF THE BODY SNATCHERS" from it's title) has NICOLE KIDMAN playing a psychiatrist who's husband/friends/clients begin acting oddly just as a mysterious flu virus floats around causing people to be sick, with the help of a friend, she discovers that alien slime is taking over the bodies of humans while they sleep, rendering them into soulless duplicates that want to take over our world, when Kidman's character winds up catching the virus, she must force herself to stay awake &amp; save her son while trying to stop this horrible takeover. As a whole, INVASION is so much better than the mediocre second remake (1993's BODY SNATCHERS: THE INVASION CONTINUES) at least this one isn't witty &amp; slow moving, in fact I found myself enjoying this one from start to finish, really the story hasn't changed much, but much like the 1956 version &amp; it's 1978 remake, this film manages to hold onto it's viewer from beginning to end, with fine performances by all involved, good suspense &amp; direction. Not quite as good as the 1956 &amp; 1978 versions, but this one does come close. Worth a look for fans!***1/2 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even if it's a film that has been remade over and over again, I still had fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Though repetitive after being remade for the 4th time, this is a slick, occasionally thrill-packed remake. If there was the weirdest film I have seen this year so far, it would be THE INVASION. Weird, because it's a story that has been around Hollywood for many staples by now, and yet they're still making it. What's weirder, is that I still didn't feel the least bit sorry for what I've watched. Even if it's a film that has been remade over and over again, I still had fun. Nicole Kidman, though, doesn't have enough room in the film to exercise and exhibit her acting skills in the role of Dr. Carol Bennell, a psychiatrist who discovers that some of her patients, or everyone else around her, are not themselves. I don't have to remind you that they are infected by the pods, I bet you know that by now. What follows are a series of car crashes and chase sequences involving Carol running and protecting her son Oliver (Jackson Bond), who happens to be immune to the alien virus. THE INVASION, obviously, tries to adapt Jack Finney's ever popular story and be a cool hotshot chase movie at the same time. It manages to offer us a lot crashes, quick deaths and fancy shots, but also succeeds to update Finney's story, but just not in the perspective we expected, I'm afraid. Nevertheless, despite its inconsistencies and over-producing, it manages to be one of the few thrillers I enjoyed this year and so. Yes, it gets pretty boring in some parts. Yes, it's a little to over-the-top, but rating it on a fun meter, it's pretty decent.Rating: *** out of 5. Movie Info Director: Oliver Hershbeigel Cast: Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, Jeffrey Wright, Jackson Bond, Veronica Cartwright Writer: David Kaiganich, Jack Finney (original story).

The space shuttle has crashed and investigators find something not of this earth in the debris. A very mysterious epidemic soon infects most of mankind. Washington, D.C. psychiatrist Carol Bennell(Kidman)suspects the mind altering outbreak to be extraterrestrial in origin. Helping her is longtime friend Dr. Ben Driscoll(Daniel Craig), who discovers the alien virus attacks people while they are in deep sleep. Carol realizes her young son may be the key to saving the human race; and she now must stay awake long enough to find her son who has ran away from her ex-husband's home. Included in the cast: Jeffrey Wright, Jeremy Northam, Eric Benjamin and Jackson Bond. I was expecting this psychological Sci-Fi to be better. There are some disturbing images, but nothing to really fear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great for the first act.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read several negative views of this film, I decided to see it and make up my own conclusions. Unfortunately, since I DID went to see it, none of that matters. In the end, the film was rather mediocre.For one thing the first part of the film sets up a nice tone of heightened tension. You had a sense that some very bad things were going to happen and kept you on your toes as the film unfolds. Too my surprise( and utter disbelief) the film falls apart and loses its sense of logic.For example there's a scene in which Kidman's character takes her son, along with his friends, for a night of trick-or-treating and ends up at a neighbor's house when the neighbor's dog viciously attacks one of her son's friends. But the kid somehow breaks the dog's nose. For some strange reason, the dog's owner shows no signs of infection, nor is Kidman suspicious about the dog's owner. This scene really makes no sense at all.And what about Homeland Security? When the "invasion" was taking place, why weren't they put on high alert from the start? Surely it would have made much more sense had the military, NSA, or the EPA for crying out loud, took immediate action. During the film, I couldn't help but wonder if the writers or the director, really had any sense of coherent logic while making this film. It worked well in 28 Days Later, so why not this one? Although I've never seen the original Body Snatchers, I wasn't expecting much anyway since War of The Worlds is kinda similar in tone and structure, but deep down this film could've been so MUCH better. The acting is fairly decent, but nothing special either. I liked Nicole Kidman's performance as well as the action and some of the SFX; probably the only redeeming qualities in this film. It's just a shame that the rest of the film feels stale.While this remake may be entertaining to some, I personally suggest the original Body Snatchers which had better characters, better suspense and terror and most importantly, a MUCH intelligently written story with an ultimate stamp-on-your-memory conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as awful as they say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure why this film is being as maligned by critics as it is. It's biggest failing is the fact that it cannot possibly stand on its own. If someone sees this film who has never heard of the concept of the original Jack Finney book or the original film and it's sequels, they would be totally lost and have no idea what the heck is going on.But for those of us steeped in the lore of the pod people (sadly no pods are used in this film) it's just another fun retelling, this time with slightly more aggressive (and seemingly evil) pod people. The threat of true violence from the pod people is greater in this film than any of the others, and the paranoia and sense of inescapable menace may not be as strong as previous sequels, but it is here.Its definitely the worst of the sequels, but for those who love this story idea, its almost just another chapter or another story in the same book. The ending is a dud and half, but i still was entertained. And trotting out Veronica Cartwright was a brilliant idea. As was the casting of Nicole Kidman: her plastic perfect looking expressionless face and acting style makes it almost impossible to tell when she's a pod person and when she's not. Daniel Craig's naturalistic acting (especially when he prepares her breakfast) throws this into even greater relief. By now, these films are not taken seriously, and "pod people" are as much a piece of popular culture as "Damien". Like the recent remake of "The Omen", most peole laughed during the screening I was in whenever the familiar "you'll feel better" statements came out of a pod person's mouth. Not because it was bad, but as an acknowledgment of fun familiarity. I heard this film changed directors part way through- I'd love to see the original cut.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I personally loved this movie.Despite being a remake of what many seem to think is a better version, this movie in itself is brilliant.It isn't just another clichéd overused plot line, like many before me had stated. It's gritty &amp; very disturbed. The camera work itself is unusually impressive, with an almost raw &amp; uncut look to it.There's more to this movie than meets the eye. It isn't just the typical Sci-fi zombie flick which makes millions of dollars in the box office. It actually makes you think (which many movie goers as I realized, hate to do.) It contains undertones of Existentialism, Political &amp; Human imperfection &amp; the question of what could have been. The ending lines itself was brilliant and Nicole did an AMAZING job in portraying the character.Again, there is more to this movie than meets the eye.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the obvious parallels, Invasion doesn't feel like a remake of the 1956, 1978 or 1993 versions of this famous yarn, it genuinely holds it own as a film not to be compared to the others but to be appreciated in its own right.Oliver Hirschbiegel has managed to capture a sense of helplessness and foreboding despite its large city setting and the scale and immediacy of the invasion taking place help instil a genuine sense that the world as we know it is going to end very quickly. The acting was OK throughout although I couldn't help but ponder on the reasoning behind casting Nicole Kidman as Carol, is it because she manages to produce a blank expressionless face without effort? Daniel Craig is OK and Jackson Bond as Carol's son is pretty decent ? I'm sure we'll be seeing more of him soon.There were a couple of issues I did have with the film though: the editing does leave a little to be desired, there were some very strange transitions and odd cuts. Also, the humanistic morals expressed in this film feel a little too contrived for my liking but it isn't forced down your throat. In fact it is quite subtle until the very end of the film. Where others may find food for thought, for me it just brought a groan.Overall there is nothing major to criticise. The effects are pretty good (the slithering Roger Reese sent a shiver down my spine) and the score suitably eerie, the story moves along at a fast pace and the characters are pretty interesting. OK, it isn't a masterpiece and it certainly isn't the definitive Body Snatchers film but it is worth a look if there isn't much else on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wake up call</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That was a good piece(well, not a masterpiece, of course!!). I accept all the above critics about it. Cliché, badly-developed characters and bad dialogues. However, the point of director to make that one is not adding a new tribute to the classic. I say it's like a wake up call to American people. The good-old USA, which's been shined till the mid-90s, gone away and no sign of a comeback. Instead, there's a nation who's ruling by aliens. That's not America we adore, they're not real Americans. Movie somehow pictured the fight between fake Americans vs. real ones. You must watch it from that point of view. We really missed the hair bands, southern rock, Hollywood way of hapinness etc.....

		<shortDescription>Interesting combination of outdated sci-fi and thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicole Kidman stars as a doctor who is trying to save her son, as well as the entire planet from an invasion of microscopic aliens, in this remake of the 1956 classic sci-film "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." Like the Jonathan Demme thriller "Manchurian Candidate", the Ashton Kutcher-Bernie Mac comedy "Guess Who?" (based on the 1967 film "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner") or the Adam Sandler comedy "Mr. Deeds" (Based on Frank Capra's 1936 film "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"); "The Invasion" belongs to a class of remakes that is created out of a desire to reintroduce modern audiences to the classics. I find these films far preferable to the class of remakes like The Italian Job (2003), The Shaggy Dog (2006), and Fun with Dick and Jane (2005) that are created out of a desire to improve on a film that never resonated with audiences in the first place. Too often, the films in the second group feel like an excuse for a writer not being able to come up with original material of his own.In the case of the original "The Invasion of the Body Snatchers," the film was not only considered to be one of the high points of 1950's science-fiction film-making, but in its day, the film was read as a metaphor for the dangers of passivity in the McCarthy era (although Director Sam Peckinpaugh never admitted the film was anything more than a film about aliens). The 2007 remake, however, leaves out any preachy subtext and simply tries to recapture the excitement and feel of 1950's science fiction through updated techniques.The result is an interesting blend of outlandish scientific absurdity with elements of the modern thriller. Science-fiction from the 1950's and earlier came from an age where modern science was at much earlier stages of deciphering the mysteries of outer space and the human body, so the science-fiction stories of the time was usually built around more fantasical plots that didn't need scientific explanations. In another recent remake of a 1950's sci-film, War of the Worlds, Stephen Spielberg didn't even try to explain the scientific absurdity of having aliens spring up from underneath the streets and just turned the film into a tight-paced thriller. Although without the craftsmanship of Spielberg to guide them, the camera-work and editing feel a little overambitious without in some scenes, but Invasion still feels like a thriller of the same caliber. Like Spielberg's "War of the Worlds," the struggles of the entire planet in the wake of an alien invasion are played out through the race of a single parent trying to protect themselves and their offspring from attack."Invasion," however, is a little more science-heavy. In "War of the Worlds," Tom Cruise spends the film outrunning the alien invasion, but since he knows practically nothing about where they came from or where else they're located, one is tempted to ask "Where exactly is he running to?" In "Invasion," issues like these are well-thought: she's running to a lab that will cure her. Of course, with this outdated plot, you have all sorts of stretches like Nicole Kidman's misguided belief that by drinking lots of mountain dew and taking pills she can stay awake forever, but Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig (who plays her boyfriend and colleague) and Jeffery Craig (playing her colleague) are such consummate professionals and they take the material so seriously, that the plot holes seem that much smaller. The film's attention to detail can be enjoyed in the same way a Tom Clancy or a Michael Crichton novel can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Invasion" was actually a love it/ hate it film.Frankly don't go to see this movie if you are expecting to see the original movie with an updated cast. It's a new movie. Based on the original "Invasion of the Body Snatchers".Every element of this movie is well done and great, with the exception of one important factor- the director. The moments of terror, and there were a few golden opportunities that COULD have been truly frightening, were lost because the director didn't think taking the camera off of Nicole Kidman was a good idea. Don't get me wrong, her performance in this was absolutely terrific.Daniel Craig, who has proved himself as a brilliant actor, has taken a new turn in this movie. Playing a sympathetic boyfriend above all. A true subtle performance of a generation where Will Farrel makes the box office. Craig may appear bored by the production, but I say he experimented with a character that is easy to watch and more believable than a freaked-out comic.The story itself has a handful of plot holes, but those can be ignored for the purpose of the fact that you are watching a movie.This movie is well worth the viewing, but it might also be better to wait for the DVD release. There is nothing here that won't be the same from the comfort of your own home, no huge explosions of grand beautiful shots that are only good in a multiplex.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misses the mark!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having seen "The invasion of the Body Snatchers" 1978 version and half of the original I have to say that this movie completely misses the mark. The previous versions had atmosphere and suspense throughout. You never know who to trust. In this version there are only a few scenes where you get that feeling. Also there is no decent buildup for events. Things just start to happen very fast. It would have helped if they slowly revealed the invasion by the aliens. I know that the original movie also contained some sort of comment on fear surrounding communism and that the 1978 version had more of a social comment. But where they succeeded in concealing these comments in plain sight,"Invasion" just throws it in to make a political statement about human nature. This could have worked if they would have shown more scenes of acts of humans in war and other political events before the actual invasion. There is also no time given to connect with the main characters. We never actually learn much about the characters. One example is Jeremy Northam (playing Tucker Kaufmann,ex-husband of the main character Nicole Kidman). In the intro we see that he gets infected and we know that something will happen to him. But not once it is shown what kind of a character he is before he was turned. So how do we know what the difference is between the real Tucker and the new one. We have to assume that he is changed because it is said so. This major flaw is part of the reason that ruined my viewing experience. The lack of suspense is something that can't be overlooked for a movie of this type. And I think that a remake at least should contain the same level of suspense that were present in it's previous versions. Don't bother with this version. Go see the original (1956) and/or 1978 version with Donald Sutherland. They are far superior!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a solid remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw a sneak preview of this movie tonight and it exceeded all my expectations. At first I wasn't very happy with the thought of a remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers (i've only seen the first one) because i liked it so much. But thankfully this movie wasn't a train wreck. Instead they kept the movie alive with an evolved story, different characters, different circumstances, and a totally different message. In fact, this movie's theme may be interpreted as the exact opposite of the original movie. While the original movie's fundamental message was to proclaim the danger of unindividuality -as seen in the rising Communist party at the time, the new movie gives the message that we need to be wary of ourselves and where we're going.There were only a few problems with the movie. First, there were moments where you don't know what just happened because of the hectic editing. One moment some characters are sitting in a room talking and the next moment they're speeding down the street in a car. I assume that this device was used either for stylistic purposes or just to keep the watch in suspense. The second problem was the main character's tendency to do what any person with common-sense wouldn't do. And lastly were the miniscule plot holes revolving around "that would never happen in real life" and "yeah right" subjects and circumstances.Overall, the movie keeps you on pins and needles. There's a lot of good suspense and a little action. I'd give the original an 8/10, this one a 7/10.</fullReview>

The story is incredible, propelling the action into many intense sequences. Kidman and Craig both offer outstanding performances, and they were the perfect roles for this film. I am surprised to see that this movie received ratings in the 6's on IMDb. Absolutely ridiculous. I am a writer, so I found the script to be excellent, and the subtext to be very moving. "Transformers" should have been the movie getting terrible reviews. But instead, it scored in the 8's. Sometimes it surprises me what America finds to be a "good movie."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Kidman, moronic message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've given +1 over the average just for Kidman only (good actress).I don't like philosophy and message of the film.It's the same old molded argument with SU ideology even 20 years after SU was vanished. Soviet position: social justice as a main social and public goal, even at the cost of heavy initial sacrifices and repressions of predators, suppression of their freedom (to eat others), if necessary. Anti-Soviet (bourgeois) position: there's nothing wrong with current social order, some predatoriness is a core feature in the human nature, time- and nature-honoured; so all must have an equal rights (the competition will be an arbiter between them, and predatoriness should be just civilized), no repression or suppression in favor of better social order is acceptable.Both sides demonized each other and actively used term "Freedom", but it had different meanings (diametrically opposite). Here the version of 'good but sterile world' is voiced by Russian diplomat in the course of some ironical and caustic fencing. It seems that he was not serious or in some parts their conversation would have been extremely offensive (the diplomat probably one of those typical authorities who was a unbending communist and now has turned to be an ardent liberal/capitalist - holier than the pope; well, he have had saber-fighting for both sides, and after bottle of vine who knows which of two sides that cunning sneaky bustard represents).But own position of authors of this movie is quit clear, and the presentment is just moronic. Yeah, peace, understanding, social justice, tolerance, no poverty, no war, no cannibalization, no crime, no stupid presidents/politics and so on - they all are the devilish, inhumane, cruel things. Such evil ones should be burned (they are depicted here as a distinguishing feature of non-humans)! Now we free you (or will free after Iraq, who's next?)! Hey, just relax, and enjoy every day with full feeling of being human now (you see how bad is what over the thousands of years you are dreaming and asking for?).What kind of stupidity is that? The same which said that be sick or dead better than have cure for free?.. Hey, guys, are you sure that you are not from the other planet?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a well planned Invasion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prior to watching The Invasion I had noticed the amount of negative press it had received and its struggle at the box office. To my surprise, The Invasion is not as bad as one suspected but it does not rise above a competent effort.A space shuttle crashes on Earth and brings with it an extraterrestrial virus which intends to invade the populace. Nicole Kidman plays a psychiatrist, who is separated from her husband and looks after their only son when events unfold. The film has a gloomy tone and its political/social commentary, if rather piecemeal is not that bad. It is a shame that The Invasion cannot decide whether it is trying to be a serious piece of film or pushing towards a more entertaining production, as a consequence it doesn't work. On a personal level, and a gripe that I have in general with films like this, is the matter of showing viruses reproducing in a computerised manner? I find it rather amateurish, what are we looking at? One blob kill another blob it does nothing to forward or inform the audience.Kidman and Craig are both good but I do not feel that the film had any sufficient characterisation to really push these two fine actors. The ending is rather predictable but The Invasion isn't all that bad. Ultimately the mechanics do not go together to make it that memorable.</fullReview>

There's a surfeit of non-contiguous set pieces (don't y'know!), a long way of saying that bits get shoved in because they're part of what happens in this sort of flick.Nicole Kidman does the same sort of job she did in The Interpreter - almost exactly the same sort of film, in fact. Daniel Craig is excellent, better than in Munich or any post-Bond role. Star of the show is Jackson Bond, a real natural.I liked some of the shooting (and occasionally adored it). The music-video approach to editing is a little self-conscious sometimes. The big moral ending is a big fudged and overstated but then one understands that the film got the studio-sausage-maker treatment, so who knows what was meant to be? 5.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but what was the point?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the fourth version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers--only not quite, because in it the bodies aren't snatched, they catch a virus, usually communicated through the hurling of green vomit. The only uniquely IBS element remaining is that the change takes place when the victims are asleep, and even this is given a new scientific, or scientific-sounding, explanation. Having the invasion spread by virus allows for the possibility of a cure, and an ending, which (apart from the framing scenes tacked on to the first movie) the earlier versions lacked. But it isn't a good ending; it's just an ending. The story doesn't allow for a good ending because it isn't really a good story, in fact hardly a story at all: just a great idea worked out logically, like a Sudoku puzzle. But it's old now: it's been copied so many times that, changing it, the movie becomes just one more copy. As always, the idea leads to some tense scenes, but as always, the scariest ones are those where people try to convince other people, without success, that their loved ones aren't their loved ones. I would have found the personality switches more disturbing if I had felt the actors' personalities stable to start with. Nicole Kidman's face wears the kinds of changes to which the faces of actresses who are aging, and have taken the appropriate measures, are prone, and of course she's using her American accent, and seems to have stolen Renee Zellwiger's voice. Three other actors are British; one of them tries to talk like an American, one like a Russian, and one--Daniel Craig--appears to want to keep people guessing. And all the characters live in Washington D.C., where nothing anybody says can be believed anyhow. I also didn't believe in some of the alienated, who don't act convincingly, or alike. So, taking it all in all, I think the alien invasion is really a cover for some more diabolical plot, like an election takeover in November. Occasionally the director pulls a stunt that confuses and distracts and throws you out of the movie. He'll cut ahead to the action of the next scene before the scene underway is over--and then back--and then ahead--and then back, as if the character is having a dream (which sometimes it is), or as if the DVD is skipping between chapters. Invasion of the Movie Snatchers. And besides, we have to sit through three false starts before the movie kicks in. You know, on second thought maybe it isn't so not-bad, after all.</fullReview>

Daniel Craig and Jeffrey Wright are okay in their roles and the action goes by very quickly. It's a fairly interesting movie up until the end. Without giving anything away the ending does do justice to the rest of the movie. At least in the two previous versions the ending meant something to the rest of the film. This ending is contrived and way to feel good for a adaptation of the rest of the films' caliper. The ending takes so much away that's why I give it a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ultimately a disappointing movie. The original had a depth absolutely missing in this version, and a tension that appears conspicuously absent. The opening concept of the invasion was quite good but after that the plot begins to unravel and descends into normal Hollywood blockbuster fare with no really thought put into the how and why. There is a nice political undercurrent running through the movie which was quite subtle but too subtle to be hang the final scene on which was what they tried to do. The plot revolves around freak random chance rather than building a more stable foundation that seems believable. The ending is a typical whitewash which dissolves consequences and flies the Hollywood banner unashamedly. It's not all doom and gloom, the movie is quite watchable thanks to a decent cast putting in decent performances. Where the movie falls down is a lack of real power that feels like it's come from one to many conference-room rewrites. This movie is just a typical modern remake with just enough new material to make it watchable but after watching it, it is just a remake. If you can accept that it's a modern rehash of a classic sci-fi which is just there to make a few bucks then the film is quite watchable and better than most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the end of the world as we know it... and everybody's just fine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Depending on your opinion regarding the continual remakes of Jack Finney's "Invasion of the Body Snatchers," you either champion the 1956 original as the definitive adapted version, or, if you're like me, feel the true masterpiece accolade belongs to Philip Kaufman's 1978 remake with Donald Sutherland. Either way, "The Invasion," has a lot to live up to. The whole concept has always been about paranoia and mass hysteria, each remake updating the setting, characters and underlying theme to suit their respective era, and out of all the multitude of flaccid remakes Hollywood churns out every other box office weekend, "Body Snatchers," was inevitably due its next progressive upgrade to reflect the new millennial fears of today. So it's a shame that the terrifying, allegorical screams of the classic originals fizzle out into a bit of a whimper in Oliver Hirschbiegel's already redundant version.First of all, the casting is all wrong. Everyone in the cast fiddles around from delivering lacklustre turns to merely adequate ones (Kidman and Craig included). Fifty percent of the tension from these movies must be supplied by a surplus of convincing performances, plus the plot is not clearly defined enough from the start to allow you sit back and soak up the terror. It's all over the place, mostly borrowing heavily from Philip Kaufman's ideas back in '78. Even the wonderful Veronica Cartwright pops up for a cameo just as Kevin McCarthy did back in Kaufman's 1978 update. But it only goes to further the comparisons of this film to its parent originals, which does not help its case. Perhaps due to its lack of invention, that and the fact that the story is so familiar to us already, Hirschbiegel had great difficulty in recreating the suspense factor we have come to expect from such adaptations based on the famous Finney novel. Hell, even Abel Ferrara did a decent, if workmanlike job, on his military base set remake, "Body Snatchers," and that was only just perfunctory. Here, the alien assimilated humans come off embarrassingly like zombies from a Romero movie (see the silly car chase scene at the climax).There are some interesting changes however. One is that the body snatching aliens are re-imagined as a virus that infects people like a flu epidemic or even more so, the AIDS virus, increasing the speed and economy of takeover ten fold, which is a neat little subversion on the dated pod people concept. The effects are just as gross though, each body snatched hybrid human spewing out infection as if they were Linda Blair in "The Exorcist." It works as an aesthetic plot device and carries with it repulsive visuals that make me want to spew too. Then there are the 'fashionable' allusions to anti-American imperialism. The biased media's spin on this imminent invasion causes the ignorance of a nation to ultimately be the end of them all (hinting at the media's appetite for continually feeding us disinformation on current events). The ideal aspiration of becoming a perfect world, where there is no war and no hate, is the ironical catalyst for this catastrophic change (John Lennon might be happy in this instance however). Hirschbiegel attempts to allegorically mutate this whole alien invasion into a metaphor for the invasion of Iraq and the enforcement of a collective ideology onto an entirely different culture. In this story even the Communists cease to be Communists because the terminal lethargy of the alien organism requires total submission from all of its victims. We become one race. There is no God in this story, only peace by means of assimilation and the extradition of all independent human thought and emotions. This may not have been the sole intention of the filmmakers however, but even the title of the film itself alludes to this metaphorical idea. I still commend it for at least trying to reshape Finney's ideas into something resembling modern issues.No matter what the thematic intentions were, "The Invasion," is still distinctly unscary for the most part. There is no real sense of this global, paranoid pandemic engulfing us all, so instead of evoking dread in the audience, we get instead just an unhappy case of déj? vu for those of you well versed in Body Snatcher film history. One scene set on Kidman's doorstep is admittedly frightening when it happens but the tension is quickly left to deflate. There are a couple of moderately heart pounding interventions, I suspect added after the test screening process, but it is not enough to elevate this apocalyptic vision of alien takeover anywhere near the urgency mark it needed to strike. Any sense of fatalistic inevitability is constantly hampered by the fact you know you are watching a modern Hollywood horror that might just give us a happy holidays ending because everyone has forgotten the true nature of a downbeat, or disturbing horror ending. Things should not end well in a film like this. Donald Sutherland's other worldly scream reverberated around my head after watching the end of this self-proclaimed sci-fi thriller. It was bleak, unsettling and inevitable. That is true horror; something which cannot be stopped, something we must acknowledge is happening yet are helpless to combat against. Where is the fatalism in this translation? Where is the horror? This is glossy remake whoring at its most impotent and insulting with glaringly obvious product placement to boot. Playstation 2 mini-advert anyone?If you want thrills, chills and spills, check out "Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1978," if you want strong, concise and allegorical storytelling at its finest, check out "Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1956," but if you want a half hearted amalgamation of both of those movies, then check out "Invasion of the Body Snatchers 2007." Recycled entertainment for desperate, remake ridden times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite Kidman and Bond, the original is unrivaled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kidman and Bond do a good job but despite their acting, the original from 1978 with Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams cannot be equaled. After seeing Halloween 9 and this one this month, it becomes clear once again that the movies from 1978 that still set the standards today in the horror genre are Halloween I and Invasion of the body snatchers. I don't understand movie producers wanting to engage in this sort of projects, since the only thing that would do would be to make a total different movie. Copying an original is quite pointless. Nevertheless, this one from 2007 is entertaining, but it did not give me the creeps. I can still remember seeing Donald and Brooke running through the invaded streets of Frisco, trying to get on a boat, finally the loss of Brooke Adams, and Donald's last hope going up in fog when the ship that could have taken him away is also invaded. The whole pace, and falling apart of everything in the 1978 one made it unforgettable. Of course the last shot in the end of the 1978 movie is legendary, and as the director himself commented, it gave the sense of loss to it all, since Donald and Brooke were so human themselves. I watched the 1978 movie with the director's comment and it showed indeed why the original movie worked out so well, from start to finish. Kidman and Bond in this one are very human, just as Donald Sutherland and Brook Adams were, but in the original the paranoia is built up slowly and very convincingly. It even has a shot of a normal street in San Francisco, just taken up with a video-cam, not acted, and it shows what you can see in every city street; no one knowing anyone, impersonality, a sense that there is somehow something wrong in every city. This proved to me the movie had at that time had it's full effect. Probably since the 1978 movie gave a right message of what was going on at that time, the economic downfall, and impersonal society, a civilization getting too complex, an out of touch feeling, or a loss of what makes us human. That theme, with excellent camera shots, is worked out very well in the original. Another thing is camera-work. Probably the camera-work, sound and music is one of the most important and invisible things that make or break a movie. Angles, colors, music, speed, pace, all those thing need a master to put together, as was the case in 1978 (also in Halloween) almost from frame to frame. Probably in writing a scene, the rule should be the same as in filming; what is it you want the scene to do? This is something new directors should look at, at how the job is done in masterpieces. This 2007 movie does just a straight job, nothing special. It tries, but lacks, the slow build-up of horror until it spirals out of control in the end. The 1978 one went out with a bang, this one fizzled. As for now, in 2007 with the internet and the world opening up, I don't see the necessity for pessimistic movies. This one is entertaining, but totally anachronistic. Watch the original after this one if you want to see a masterpiece. Kidman and Bond deserve better movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing, Messy, Poorly-Made Adaptation Of Classic Science-Fiction Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carol Bennell is a shrink in Washington DC who starts noticing disturbing behaviour all around here - people acting in blank-faced herds and non-conformists being isolated and detained. What is going on, and can Carol rescue her son from her ex-husband, who seems to have succumbed to this dehumanising condition ?This is the fourth version of Jack Finney's classic serial Invasion Of The Body Snatchers and easily the worst (the best is Philip Kaufman's 1978 version). This is a shame, because aside from a lame happy ending, David Kajganich's script is a good one with some nice new wrinkles on an old tale; a heroine with a mother's protective interest, an explicit political dimension to the story, and a cleverly creepy idea - the aliens blame the epidemic on a virus and launch a huge inoculation programme which converts countless more people. The cast are pretty good, but the second-half in particular is overloaded with action so that Kidman doesn't have much to do but crash cars. The best player is Cartwright - the only survivor of the second version - as a twitchy patient who is convinced her husband isn't really her husband. The big problem though is the lacklustre direction (important plot points are rushed past, the action scenes are often incoherent) and the criminally awful editing by Hans Funck and Joel Negron. I don't recall ever having seen such a poorly cut major studio film before - the scenes are often confusingly mismatched, there's no sense of the moment, and the efforts at cross-cutting between scenes are ludicrous and off-putting. Compare it with Don Siegel's 1955 original, where the story and action flow seamlessly through the editing and the suspense just racks and racks (Siegel was originally an editor). I hate movies where filmmakers try to be stylish; if you're gonna be stylish, then follow Yoda's advice - do, or do not, there is no try. This really spoiled the film for me and it's frustrating because there isn't anything else wrong with it. Apparently this movie was the subject of mucho studio tampering, so I guess it probably wasn't Hirschbiegel's fault, but it's still an annoying mess. If you want to see a proper version of this great science-fiction classic though, please check out any of the other three adaptations (including Abel Ferrara's underrated 1993 Body Snatchers, where Meg Tilly and Forest Whitaker are both astounding). They all beat the pants off this. I would have given this two more stars if it wasn't for that godawful editing, which really does suck, big time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fair, if forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Invasion' is a filler sci-fi thriller to catch if there is nothing else you fancy seeing at the cinema (or renting on DVD) and it becomes quite obvious upon viewing why this will never win any awards of excellence. Based on Jack Finney's novel 'The Body Snatchers', this film sees Carol Bennell, a psychiatrist and mother to seven-year-old Oliver, gradually becoming aware of various people around her acting oddly in the aftermath of a NASA shuttle crash. It becomes apparent that this strange epidemic is threatening to overpower the world and, when she herself is infected by her ex-husband, she and her son are vital to finding the cure.The actors give fairly decent performances but they aren't stretched to show their capabilities, which is a shame because this stars good actors like Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. This film is rather formulaic and, as such, the suspense is sucked from it. We have the doctor friends who are in crucial positions to develop a cure, a discussion about why it would be so unnatural for humanity to rid itself of war and crime (for this is what the alien infection accomplishes), Bennell's young son conveniently being the key to finding the cure, Bennell's boyfriend supposedly coming to rescue her only for him to be infected too, etc. Instead of adding complexity to the plot and characters, we instead plod from A to B to C in a predictable fashion.A more superior take on the Bodysnatchers scenario is probably Donald Sutherland's 'The Pupper-Masters', where the alien virus is more threatening and time is taken to reflect on the sense of violation the infected must feel at losing control of their bodies and minds. 'The Invasion' is a film you see if you are seeking a simple plot that doesn't require any thinking from the viewer. It's not terrible but it's bland and rather forgettable once seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the cinematography, and the editing jazzed up a few of what might have been overly talky exposition bits. Some good action scenes, more suspenseful than a thriller, or horror flick. I was scared at the original, and the remake, but aside from a couple of "gotchas" not so much here. Nicole Cheesecake alert: a couple of nice scenes of the skinny one, will she ever stop being easy on the eyes? I was concerned with the mixed message about humanity-it seemed that there was a case being made for homogeneity as being a solution to war, and other ills of mankind. There was also a lot of stilted dialog (NOT from the possessed ones) and scientific plot holes you could drive a zombie-covered BMW through-especially the end. I mean, did they run out of time? I won't waste much time comparing this with the originals; suffice to say, put them out of your mind, this isn't a body snatcher remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Invasion Of The Non Subtle Subtext</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm always the first to whine about remakes . They never match never mind exceed the original but now I come to think about the exception to the rule is the 1978 version of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS which surpasses the 1956 version . Philip Kaufman's remake is a masterwork in paranoia as Donald Sutherland's health inspector finds his city being infiltrated by aliens pods . Jack Finney's novel was also remade in a slightly lacklustre film called BODY SNATCHERS that shot itself in the foot by being set in a military thereby neutralising the whole concept of humans being individuals with unique idiosyncratic personalities This version from 2007 has a lot to live up to and is hamstrung by being an overfamiliar story . I will give it some credit unlike most of the critics who bombarded it with mediocre reviews on its release and say it contains a very thought provoking element in that the more the alien virus converts humanity the less wars and political strife plague humanity which told via television news clips in the background . The film then needs to hammer this subtext over the audiences head at every opportunity just in case someone might have fallen asleep and missed itIt goes without saying that when THE INVASION works best is when it's at its most subtle . Of course there's no way it's going to surpass the slowly built up suspense and paranoia of the 1978 version but some scenes do have a creepy menace to them as the heroine sits on a tube train and starts to worry that her fellow passengers are infected with the alien virus . But there's not enough scenes like this and instead we have to endure a sweet little kid ( Hollywood cliché number one ) a car chase ( Hollywood cliché number two ) and an ending that gives the impression the producers just got bored of it and pulled a rabbit out of a hat</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made but flawed and sometimes obvious science-fiction thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Something eerie has come to Earth after the Space Shuttle crash landed on Earth. The space shuttle has brought back something out of this world. An alien life-form much like fungus or spore. It reaches out from human begin. Once you sleep, the alien life-form takes over you. The alien takes over your life, you look the same but you are emotionless. Washington, DC psychiatrist Carol Bennell (Oscar-Winner:Nicole Kidman) slowly finds out that people are acting strangely. Her colleague Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig) notices the same. Now human begins are getting away from the soulless replicants. You only can fool them by looking emotionless but it doesn't last. The only thing, you can do is staying awake as much as possible to stay alive.Directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel (Das Experiment, Downfall, Five Minutes of Heaven) made an intriguing, sometimes fascinating and exciting science-fiction thriller with good performances from the cast. The premise isn't new, since it was made before three times during the 1950's, 1970's and 1990's as "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" expect the 1990's version was simple titled "Body Snatchers". The only thing is really new in this version is the alien life-form in a shape of fungus or spore. There is no alien pods in this one and no eerie screams from the replicants, which there were classics from the original movies. Although watching "The Invasion", you can tell that some things doesn't work and the feature smells re-shoots in some obvious moments.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes an documentary that runs nearly 19 minutes and three mini-featurettes. "The Invasion" is certainly an nice try, the movie works during some of the action sequences or suspenseful moments. Kidman certainly does her best in her role. But the only thing that feels out of place is the twist ending, which isn't really convincing. The bleaker endings of the previous three movies worked better. Otherwise, it is well made with some good moments and an fine performance by Kidman makes it worth watchable, despite some serious flaws. Victoria Cartwright, who was in the 1978 version appears in an amusing small role. James McTiegue (Ninja Assassin, V for Vendetta) did the re-shoots of the film with re-writes by The Wachowski Brothers (The Matrix Trilogy, Bound, Speed Racer). Originally the script was written by David Kajganich (Town Creek, directed by Joel Schumacher) before the re-shoots. Based on a novel by the late Jack Finney. Watch for Malin Akerman in a small uncredited role. (*** ?/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen all the previous versions of this story, which no doubt made it easier to appreciate this film on it's own merits. I thought the movie was creepy as hell, and I also found the message fascinating.In an early scene, a Russian diplomat says the following, and the passage is repeated in voice-over at the end of the movie: "All I am saying is that civilization crumbles whenever we need it most. In the right situation, we are all capable of the most terrible crimes. To imagine a world where this was not so, where every crisis did not result in new atrocities, where every newspaper is not full of war and violence. Well, this is to imagine a world where human beings cease to be human." The movie is clearly saying that, while we don't want to give up free will and the other (positive) things that make us human, the trade-off is violence and destruction and all the other (negative) things that are also aspects of being human. It was intriguing and I thought about it long after the chills that the movie evoked had faded.I know this movie was not a critical or financial success, and I assume that has much to do with trying to blend an action/horror movie with commentary on humanity (very difficult to do well). People who wanted more horror and action were probably irritated, and people who would have liked the message (like me!) obviously stayed away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicole Kidman, Action Heroine?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Invasion" is, by my count, the third re-wiring of the classic '50s sci-fi flick "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." Our heroine in this version is the still-foxy Nicole Kidman, a divorced big-city psychiatrist with the standard Hollywood-issue adorable young son. As the film opens, a space shuttle tragically breaks up during re-entry to Earth, causing some to suspect that an alien virus tagging along on the ship has now been spread all along its debris path. Shortly thereafter, Nicole begins to notice that some of her patients, and also her ex-husband (a big wiggie with the Center for Disease Control), are acting a little -- odd. Of course, viewers of the previous "Body Snatchers" films are familiar with the protocol; if you're infected with the alien invader (which spreads in the form of a flu-like virus in this version, rather than via the plant-like "pods" of previous films), you will be transformed in your sleep. You'll still look like yourself, but you won't BE yourself. Shortly thereafter widespread infection, and panic, ensues, as the alien intelligence grows and those who've been transformed begin to outnumber the "normal" people. Kidman and her doctor friend (Daniel "New Bond" Craig) figure out the source of the infection and how it works, but by this time Kidman has unwittingly handed off her son to his father. He, of course, has already been 'snatched,' so she races off to retrieve the kid before he too becomes "one of them." For a while things devolve into standard action-movie silliness as Kidman &amp; Kid avoid numerous capture attempts by the Zombie-like "Snatchers" and make it to a safe haven at a laboratory run by New Bond's scientist pals. To add extra bits of tension, Nicole's been "infected" by her ex hubby so she has to stay awake at all costs to avoid being "snatched," and as it turns out, her son happens to be immune to the alien virus and may be the key to finding a cure for it, which makes him a special threat to the invaders that they must deal with by any means necessary. Therefore, Kidman's got a lot on her plate in this flick.It seemed to get a lot of bad reviews when it was first released, but I enjoyed "The Invasion" for the most part (though I admit that may be due in large part to my 20+ year crush on Ms. Kidman). It does a nice job of getting you hooked during the first half of the movie, and Kidman (who, it must be noted, looks fiiiiiiiine in a tight sweater) is believable enough as a stressed out Mom trying to keep her child safe, but past a certain point the movie simply turns into a seemingly endless series of chase scenes, until we reach an unexpectedly happy ending that feels tacked on. I haven't seen all of the various "Body Snatchers" remakes but of the ones I have seen, I seem to recall their endings being a lot bleaker (and therefore more realistic).Still, "The Invasion" is worth a rental if creeping paranoid sci-fi is your thing, or if you have a crush on Nicole Kidman, like I do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, another take on the Invasion of the Body Snatchers. What does this offer the others do not? Nothing really. The major draw is how it is simply modernized. I like how the Russian, Yorrish, makes some comments about a perfect world without war, poverty and the ilk can only exist without man in it. This movie demonstrates that in the sense that man is being taken over by a spore. It genetically alters the host putting the original consciousness into "sleep mode", while the altered person continues on.The big things that this movie hits at is how our society today relies on drugs, any form, to suppress our problems. We are constantly struggling with not our selves, but with one another in a fight to find our own identity, and thusly retain it. Shedding that individuality, the self, and become of a superorganism we can shed the issues that plight us. However, at what costs? The point in older films is the idea of why fight it is because what would the purpose of living be if there was no sense of being an individual.This movie, does not really go down this angle much, but focus's more on Kidman's struggle to find her son. Considering the boy is the answer to the epidemic, they don't play on it hard enough.As far as the background conspiracy and cover up angles, it is played well enough to give you the gist of it all. The government uses the concept of "inoculations" to fight a pandemic flu infection. People line up for the shots, hoping not to become infected with this supposed deadly super virus. This however, is what I drew from it, as it is only hinted at in quick snips whenever a television is in the scene. Casual viewers may miss this, astute viewers won't.All in all, a good suspense film. It has a few edge of your seat pieces, but not enough to get the heart pacing quick enough. Personally, I also found the ending a bit to "cheery", even though it is "business as usual" for the human race. I just don't care for the idea that the director didn't seem to be gutsy enough to create a truly dramatic ending for the film. It was anticlimactic, honestly. Either way, though, not a bad addition to any movie lovers collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very pleased with this movie. Like her ex-husband, Nicole Kidman stars in a remake of a 1950s sci-fi classic. Kidman plays Carol Bennell, a Washington DC psychiatrist, faced with a crisis when alien spores infect humans, through liquid, causing them to become emotionless and hugely desirous of converting every Earthling to their mutated species. It is during the REM stage of sleep that the "infection" converts those exposed to the alien species so Carol must make sure that she never sleeps after she is exposed to the infection. Carol is aided in her quest by her boyfriend/scientist Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig) and together the two realize that Carol's son Oliver is not susceptible to being converted due to a strain of chicken pox he suffered previously. I like this sci-fi remake more than "War of the Worlds" which was a bit overwrought and if one merely wants to see a good movie with no pretensions other than to provide entertainment one will like this movie. It gets a grade of A- and a recommendation that acknowledges it is a worthy remake of a 1950s classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as some critics said it was!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Invasion did not get a very good critical reception and I wonder why that's so. After all, this is a sci-fi movie about bodies being snatched by aliens. If you count up all the positive things in 'The Invasion', that will balance out the bad. Therefore, this film ranks a passable "5".Let's look at the good things first. 'The Invasion' starts off simply and effectively. A shuttle craft plummets to earth after some kind of malfunction. Pieces of the craft contain alien spores which can infect and ultimately take over peoples' DNA after they fall asleep. The spores start spreading after souvenir hunters start picking up pieces of the doomed craft (there's a great line about someone selling a piece of the wreckage on eBay).Tension builds as we see how the transformation of ordinary people into zombies affects the protagonist, Carol Bennell (a psychiatrist played by Nicole Kidman). We see these transformations beginning with one of Carol's patients who claims she no longer recognizes her abusive husband as someone she really knows (instead of abusing her, he kills the family dog without emotion!). Then when Carol leaves the office, the camera pans out to reveal what has happened to the wider society?now the 'pod people' walk around with blank stares on their faces while the enforcers amongst their group grab 'normal' people and infect them against their will. In a sense, the pod people (or better yet, the spore people) are a metaphor for cult-like societies (such as North Korea) who brainwash their followers into slave-like submission.Carol's ex-husband, Tucker, works for the Center for Disease Control and he's infected early by the alien invaders. He returns from Atlanta (where he's had no contact with his son for two years) and suddenly wants visitation rights from Carol who has no choice to now let her ex see her son. Tucker obviously wants to infect the son, Oliver, (winningly played by an extremely talented child actor, Jackson Bond) but it turns out he's immune due to having contracted chicken pox as a very young child (don't ask me to explain the science behind why he develops an immunity). The rest of the movie is taken up with Carol trying to save her son from Tucker's clutches and also trying to avoid falling asleep after Tucker infects her.I think that Nicole Kidman signed on to make this movie precisely because one of the themes is that the maternal bond is elemental. Carol bonds with Oliver and the two actors have great chemistry together (despite this being a horror movie, many women will be drawn to it due to the mother/son chemistry). Daniel Craig (looking much better than how he appears in the James Bond movies) is effective as Ben Driscoll as a low-key scientist who's trying to help Carol escape the clutches of the aliens.A group of supporting actors in a scene taking place at the Russian Embassy also gives 'The Invasion' a brief window of respectability. Driscoll's friends are a Czech couple who are friends with the Russian Ambassador, Yorish. He ironically argues with Carol that the Social Dawinism of his hot-headed Russian culture is far superior to the wishy-washy liberalism of the West (pointing out that she seeks to take the fire out of her patients by dulling them with psychotropic medication).'The Invasion' falters in the first half due to the screenwriter's insistence on depicting Carol as being completely myopic. Despite the fact that she is a psychiatrist and would naturally be skeptical of some of her patients' claims, there are too many clues that would cause her to become aware of the alien invasion much sooner than how it occurs in the storyline. The writers could have solved this lack of plausibility by perhaps establishing early on that Carol is one of those professional people who is so completely devoted to science and so contemptuous of anything that might smack of the supernatural that it would blind her to what was actually going on around her.The second half of 'The Invasion' becomes repetitious with too many chase scenes and the cliché of Driscoll, Carol's best friend, suddenly being taken over by the aliens at the film's climax. Jeffrey Wright is completely forgettable as Dr. Galeano, Driscoll's buddy who develops the vaccine that saves humanity. Finally, I didn't buy at all the news media's failure to uncover the alien invasion. Despite the horrific changes in the vast majority of the population, early on there had to be some uninfected people in the media who would have broadcast what was going on, not only on television but on the internet as well. Instead, the obvious changes are labeled as "flu-like symptoms".I found 'The Invasion' to be mildly entertaining. Plotwise, it sort of ran out of ideas in the second half but technically the film was well-served by excellent editing and a moody and introspective soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, that's about it, really. The technology and effects are sophisticated, the etiology of the disease believable. The story moves quickly; that's one thing about the original Body Snatchers movie, you get to the point fast. The most philosophically meaningful scene is where Carol, as she's trying to round up her precious boy and get the flock outa there, horrifyingly learns that Ben has been turned. She's pointing a Glock at him and some other newbie zombies, and he says:"Carol, look at yourself. Is this who you are? Is this who you want to be? We were wrong to fight them. Remember our trip to Colorado? Remember the Aspen grove? Recall how peaceful it was. Remember what you said to me? You wondered how it would be if people could live like these trees... completely connected with each other, in harmony, as one."...For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2008</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read a lot of negative comments about this film, and I know I risk being accused of being a Nicole Kidman fan, but I really like what they did here.To us the shuttle crash as a means to introduce the virus was brilliant. The use of "House"-like pictures of what was going on in the body was also very good.The philosophical underpinnings of this film were also worth contemplating. Do we have a world without violence by all becoming dittoheads, or do we have conflict and remain human? Some may opt for Stepford, but I kinda like having differences.Kidman and Craig did good jobs, and there was enough suspense to make this a worthwhile film. I won't jump on the Jackson Bond bandwagon, even though he was good, as I feel that Rebecca Windheim set the standard for 10-year-olds in Black Swarm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Invasion Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig star in the fourth remake of a well-paced thriller and mystery that kept my attention from beginning to end. What makes this movie work in my opinion is the acting, it was really convincing, especially from Nicole Kidman and Jackson Bond. One scene that fits the perfect example of good acting is the scene in the store where Nicole Kidman and Jackson Bond are at and Nicole Kidman falls asleep and Jackson Bond comes running looking for his mother and he starts crying when he finds out that his mother has fallen asleep because he's afraid that she might become one of the intruders that poisoned her body earlier on in the film. Anyways, I'll get to that later on after I explain a little bit of what the movie is about.The movie starts out with a space shuttle crash and apparently the salvaged parts from the wreckage contained an extra-terrestrial virus (what I call the intruder) and Carol Bennell's (played by Nicole Kidman)ex is the first one to get infected with this virus which throughout the movie, it spreads from person to person. Carol Bennell is a psychiatrist who comes upon the virus through a patient who believes her "husband is not really her husband." As the movie plays out, Carol Bennell tells her friend Ben Driscoll of what's been happening and he shares the same feelings she does. From then on, they embark on a dangerous quest that leads Nicole Kidman to suspect her ex might be one of the intruders and it leads her to get infected by her ex. How this virus affects you is if you fall asleep, you will become one of "them" so Carol Bennell makes sure she doesn't fall asleep until they develop a vaccine for it and throughout the movie, there was many times where she was dangerously close to falling asleep. While many suspect that the movie had too much of a happy ending, I won't reveal anything but to me, it really wasn't a happy ending.What I liked about this movie is the paranoia that surrounds everybody once the movie gets going, the people who aren't infected have this aura of uneasiness from the people around them and it really makes this movie work to its full potential. It reminded me of how the government brain-washes everybody through the corporate media and the lies they continue to spit out each day and people go on believing it. sooner or later, more people will believe it and we'll have a New World Order on our hands and everybody will be emotionless zombies like the book "1984". Like I stated earlier, another thing that makes this movie work is the acting from Nicole Kidman and the kid that plays her son, I've always respected Nicole Kidman as an actress and she's one of many actresses in my opinion that fit the mold of a "good actress". There were times in the movie where I really felt for her because in the movie, her ex takes off with her son and she has a little bit of an emotional scene and that really made me feel for her. Another scene that I thought was excellent was how Daniel Craig became infected and he turned into an intruder and he tried to take Nicole Kidman's son away but Nicole Kidman reacted and she has a big emotional scene that put me in the place of her, she was a mother who deeply cared for her son and Nicole Kidman did a great job of conveying those emotions.Some people will say that the mother trying to protect her son plot device is a little overdone because so many movies have done it like "The Ring" but I feel that it really works well here. I also like the political allegory in this movie, even though the writers should have gone into more detail with it, I still enjoy it and I believe they're right about if humans not showing any emotion, then there won't be any wars or death or mayhem that consumes the world today. To put my review to a rest, I think this movie is a good mystery thriller that works well in all areas.My rating of The Invasion: 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been wanting to see this movie since I first saw the trailer before it's release, but didn't bother doing so until now via rental. Reviews had me questioning whether it was any good or not, so I simply decided to put it on the wayside until my interest peeked again.While I'm not upset about missing it, it was indeed a worthy film and was much more enjoyable than the negative hype suggested. Kidman did well with her role, with the "concerned mother" stigma as well as someone intertwined into the suggested solution for the pandemic. Craig does well as a smaller, yet important role. Other small roles were cast appropriately as well. Cartwright for her hypertensive role (and ties to the '78 classic "Snatchers"), Weston &amp; Sommer as the elder privileged socialites, and even Wright in a small but crucial role.Things are paced well, and get going pretty quickly as to not leave you hanging too much on a "where's the story" beginning. Explanations as to the logic behind the pandemic are clearly stated but not overly pushed as to force logical science to interfere with the story telling. While compared to the '78 classic "Snatchers" as a reboot or revamp of sorts, "The Invasion" clearly takes itself away from a full retelling by creating it's own individual modern Sci-Fi story that simply follows initial ideas of it's predecessor(s).Overall a good film, definitely worth renting if you haven't seen it yet and are a fan of either the '78 classic or interested in the movie in itself in general. Good performances, solid pacing, great Sci-Fi roots...worth a few bucks. The only thing I could ask more of the film is a minor bit of back story as to the "introduction" of the pandemic prior to where it picks up at the start of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, above all elements of a good suspense/thriller, is amazingly creepy. The blank stares of a million citizens walking aimlessly towards nothing. The intense, determined attempts to turn every living, breathing person into one of them. Nicole Kidman, one of my favorite actresses, does a great job as the scared and desperate mother; also as a "body snatcher". Her son, is also awesome in displaying the affectionate yet wise little boy who understood the measures that had to be taken for survival. The boyfriend/best friend, did well as the "i wont let anything happen to you" guy, as he also went to extreme actions to save them. I would compare this movie to "The Others" which also stars Nicole Kidman, but this movie with much more excitement/suspense/intensity. Also one of the few horror/suspense/thriller movies that serves its purpose without little to no violence. I haven't seen the 70s version of this movie, so maybe once i do my perspective on this movie will change. But until then, i recommend this movie to sci-fi, horror, suspense and thriller fans. It falls into all those genres.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Invasion, The (2007) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Third remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers has Nicole Kidman trying to fight off being transformed into the alien creature. This time out a NASA space shuttle explodes as it enters Earth, which causes a virus to spread turning people. Due to all the production problems and the constant change of directors, I was expecting something really bad but it turns out fairly decent, although I'd say this is the weakest of the four versions. I've read that the original version tries to use its brain and not muscle and apparently a lot of that was cut out of the second half when the film turns into a non-stop action movie. The movie fells and gets tiresome during the final third of the movie but everything leading up to that is actually pretty good with a fair amount of suspense. Kidman gives another excellent performance and really captures the paranoia of her character as well as the fear and mystery of the story. Daniel Craig sleepwalks through his role and really doesn't add much. The rest of the supporting cast are pretty bland but that might be due to this being Kidman's picture from start to finish. Another annoying thing is the constant political jabs, which flow at different parts of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the opportunity to see this on a long-haul flight from Washington to Salt Lake City on Delta's new on-demand movie service. I was actually surprised at how good this movie was. It kept me pretty well entertained for the length. I remember seeing previews for this last summer and hoping to see it since I'm a big fan of Kidman and Craig. But, alas, we missed it in theatres -- it was only out for a millisecond I suppose because of the terrible reviews. I frequent rottentomatoes.com and this movie has only 18% positive reviews which puts it in line with other semi-horror flops like The Messengers. This movie has the star-power to at least earn SOME positive reviews.While not as fast-paced as I Am Legend, it offers the same level of creepiness. I have not seen the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers, or the remakes, but I can say this movie could stand on its own. Perhaps the reason it was so poorly received was because of these comparisons to the original.If you're looking for an entertaining thriller with a great cast, solid writing, and an interesting premise, you'll enjoy this.</fullReview>

Wrong.First off the script is dull and cheesy with Nicole Kidman sounding more like a "Brady Bunch" mom than a real life one. I was shaking my head every time she gave out a line. Daniel Craig is dull and is not at all believable.Kidman has no connection with her son. The giant problem the movie faces is that I didn't like the characters. I thought they were selfish. I found myself cheering for the alien substance to take over Earth just to shut Kidman up. If you want an energetic remake that is fast and entertaining check out I Am Legend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There aren't many films in history that get to have three remakes. Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) is one of them. I guess if films were conscientious they might be flattered to be remade once, maybe twice. But I don't think any film would be flattered to be remade a third time and slaughtered and butchered in that remake to be precise.This fourth version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers starts with the events that could lead to the untimely demise of Earth's population. While not entirely impossible they do seem a little strange. It then goes on in the same way as the original and suddenly comes to a halt about 95 minutes later, leaving a foul taste in the mouth. Like the taste one gets when one eats food that is months past its due date.This remake does everything wrong that it can do wrong and flat out insults the original film and its makers. It doesn't add anything new. Not a single sausage. Not even a little fickle effect to show the intention of the aliens. All it does is conjure up emotions that have nothing to do with fear and anxiety as the first one did, but emotions that deal with irritation, boredom, anger at having paid for a ticket and wasting valuable time sitting in the cinema.4 out of 10. Complete waste of tape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Body Snatchers - the sanitized version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes I really wonder what makes non-American directors cross the ocean and try to make films at Hollywood. Should they really do it at any price? Based on any script? I would be very interested to ask German director Oliver Hirschbiegel this question. He became well known internationally with 'The Untergang' (Downfall) an amazing historical drama about the last days in Hitler's bunker, blessed with fantastic acting by Bruno Lanz. Why on Earth and in the Outer Space pick the fourth adaptation of the 'Body Snatchers'? Especially when there is nothing really new in the script about or around the story.Let me be clear - 'The Invasion' is not a bad film. It actually works pretty well for much of the time, replacing the most gory and graphical images from the other adaptation with a more sanitized and civilized imaginary. Zombies here are not exactly living dead, but just social engineered version of happy individuals in a politically correct society pushed a little bit to the extreme, but not enough to seem more than boring in normal circumstances. If the saying of the film was that PC is as bad as zombies it is quite a subtle one, maybe too subtle.Hirschbiegel knows how to direct his actors and here he enjoys the participation of superstars Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. They are both OK, maybe Kidman is amazingly just a little bit too young and too beautiful for the cerebral role, but they cannot win over the techno-speech they are made to declaim for most of the time, not leaving any room for too much emotion. The worst is however the ending which is really a spoiler, not true to the book, not true to the logic, and makes useless the whole tension building of the rest of the film.If the film was made by a young director I would have said - 'promising, it's a pity he was not lucky with a better script'. In Hirschbiegel's case my opinion is that he should just not have taken this opportunity to work in the US - wait for a better story or do a much better film in Germany.</fullReview>

This movie showed that it was OK to be human, that it was OK to be an asshole, that wars and conflicts are inevitable and necessary. I say to hell with that, I don't need my other bad side to define what I am, I would like myself and everyone else to get rid of that bad side, if not then lessen it. And we would still be human, we wouldn't have to kill each other over nothing. Over god, nationalism, supremacy or pride.I hate the director who made this movie, clearly he says it's OK to read the newspapers about the Iraq War and say: "When is this all going to end" - and that is the best we can do?

		<fullReview>Normally, I wouldn't support the idea of remaking "The Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (although it's apparently been done a few times); I consider the original one with Kevin McCarthy almost sacrosanct. But this new version - despite being mostly predictable - brings up an interesting point: what if a virus turning the human race into cold, insensitive beings ended up solving so many of the problems that we see? What results from the infection's overtaking of humanity looks like ultra-idealism, what with ending all wars and stuff. But would we want to lose what makes us human? Then again, I can't guarantee that the people behind the movie intended for that sort of interpretation. After all, many people interpreted the original version as either an anti-communist screed or an anti-McCarthyism screed, while the director apparently intended it as a plain old alien invasion story.Overall, this one's worth seeing, if only once. Starring Nicole Kidman (looking very much like Grace Kelly), Daniel Craig, Jeffrey Wright (the CIA agent in "Syriana"), Josef Sommer (Harrison Ford's boss in "Witness") and Veronica Cartwright.</fullReview>

He was too perfect to be in this movie, and he just didn't seem right for the role.

		<fullReview>The excellent book The Body Snatchers has been made in three occasions which told the story with important messages.In 1956(the best of all)it worked as a metaphor of the communism.In 1978,we saw a very interesting movie with good messages.In 1993,the always interesting director Abel Ferrara made a solid movie about the military conspiracies and paranoia.But The Invasion,version 2007,is boring and it does not give any interesting message.It's easy to note that The Invasion has a few interesting ideas behind the edition which makes the movie chaotic because of the combination of two different directors.A few months ago,I knew about the crash of intentions between director Oliver Hirshbiegel and producer Joel Silver.Hirshbiegel made a slow movie which did not have a clear conclusion while Silver wanted a summer blockbuster.So,Hirshbiegel was fired and James Mc Teigue was hired as an emergency director while The Wachowski Brothers rewrote things from this script.The movie is boring and it could not keep me interested.I have liked a lot Hirshbiegel's previous films(The Experiment and Downfall)and I'm sure the few interesting things this film has come from him so I give him the benefit of the doubt.I suppose he originally made a good movie and I hope there will be a DVD from this movie which is the version he did.The Invasion is a boring and chaotic movie which I do not recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When William Shakespeare wrote the immortal line "that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet" in Romeo and Juliet, odds are he might have been tempted to reword that line had he borne witness to The Invasion.Billed as a loose re-telling of The Invasion of the Body Snatchers, this Nicole Kidman vehicle plays out more like a patchwork quilt of sci-fi horror, as if writer Dave Kajganich took a blender and tossed in the original Jack Finney novel, added elements of Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, and a little of Wolfgang Petersen's Outbreak to round out the flavor. The end result is a movie that might have appealed to a critic's sense of charity had it been a low budget independent film with no-name actors vying for a break. However considering that this had the backing of a major studio, features two prominent stars (Kidman and Craig), and actually used The Invasion of the Body Snatchers as its working title during production, and you have a movie that almost screams out for a savaging.For reasons best known only to Kajganich and director Hirschbiegel, the premise of plant-like alien pods as the catalyst for cloning the human populace is jettisoned in favor of a space-born virus that arrives on Earth via the fuselage of a crashed space shuttle ? presumably chosen either to make the story seem more real and plausible or because it offered a way to quickly, easily and cheaply cobble together an ending hinging on a lab-developed vaccine (notice the absence of the word "exciting" there).The rest of the story is pretty much paint-by-numbers as Kidman plays Carol Bennell, one of only a few folks who clue in fairly early that the people around them are being taken over by an alien force which kicks into morphing high gear during REM sleep ? pretty much the only visible plot device retained from the original Body Snatchers premise. From there we are treated to Bennell trying to track down her kid who is staying with his now alien daddy, Bennell fleeing from zombie-like mobs, and Bennell trying to stay awake. Along the way, little is done to capitalize on the feeling of paranoia that fueled the original. Instead the audience is presented with some cheap gun play and a car chase, almost as if to deliberately try and hit a few of those precious formulaic "action beats" that so many popcorn movie scripts call for.So who is to blame for this poor pastiche of film making? Certainly not Kidman and Craig, who did their best with what they were given to work with. Was it Kajganich's pedestrian script, Hirschbiegel interpretation, or the result of meddling studio execs who called in director James McTeigue (V for Vendetta) to re-shoot entire scenes they weren't happy with? Or maybe all of the above? With all due apologies to the Bard, compost by any other name would still stink, and insofar as compost goes, The Invasion is a heap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>decent idea but stupid characters, like "Panic Room"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this movie on opening night. I had heard in the past of the "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (upon which 'The Invasion' is apparently based, apparently) but didn't know its storyline. So I went into seeing this movie without any kind of expectations (i.e. expecting it to be better than that original flick).As all the trailers show, this movie is about a female psychiatrist (Kidman) attempting to rescue herself and her son from mutant humans who have been infected by an alien virus that hitched a ride on a Space Shuttle. The shuttle crashes, the virus spreads, and many tens of millions are infected. Those who touch the virus and subsequently fall into deep sleep become emotionless and zombie-like. As all the trailers make known, those people who have not touched the virus or who don't fall asleep after infection are normal. However, unaffected individuals who show emotion are quickly identified, caught, and converted by the mutants.Generally speaking, I thought the basic storyline was a good one. Like another IMDb reviewer, I too felt that this movie has a valuable message, especially in today's corporate world. At the very least, the movie challenges the sources of our behavior -- cognitive unfeeling sources and emotional sources. I agree with another reviewer who remarked that the movie had some genuinely tense moments, but not terrifying ones. Unlike one last reviewer, I really didn't find the car chases to be particularly exciting.To me, the movie falls flat due to the painfully obvious stupidity exhibited by some of the characters. I don't want to reveal any spoilers. Basically there are times in the movie where I wanted to shout at Nicole Kidman's character for some stupid choices. She makes the same kind of stupid mistakes that Jodie Foster's character made in "Panic Room." So if you were disappointed with that movie, you may be disappointed with this one. (Generally I couldn't help thinking that if a MALE doctorate holder were the main character of the movie, the flick would have ended 30 minutes earlier.) 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Invasion of the Letdown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off instead of pods, we get a virus.Now I'm a avid 16 year old fan of 1950's science fiction, I've grown to love the genre over the years because of all these crazy nightmares I'd have when I was a kid after seeing these wacky movies.There was really nothing new or original in this I hadn't seen, I found myself saying, "why am I watching this, it is exactly like the others but nowhere near as good." The plot of the original is so creative and intriguing if I had to make a list of my favorite plots it'd be in the top 10. Some really like the 78 version, but to me it is less than exhilarating. But it did bring the message back and make it relevant to what was happening in the world. Other than that, plot wise and character wise, it had me thinking there is nothing new to bring to the table!!! If you're going to remake a classic you better have something unique that will make it stand out. Nicole Kidman's performance was fine in this but disposable like a few of her others. Daniel Craig also, what the hell? His role is given practically nothing I mean he contributed next to nothing and then he'll just kind of show up now and then so the audience can say, "Oh it's that new Bond." See, when I looked here at IMDb last summer and saw they were doing another remake I immediately became excited. Then the release date changes, there is no trailer for quite awhile and bad word of mouth begins. There were so many warning signs that this would really disappoint me. Then the trailer came out and I regained hope, like in the trailer there were moments that just gave me chills the scene on the metro where the guy says, "You can fool them, just don't show emotion.." I just really appreciated seeing some love for the great story and I showed it to all my friends and family telling them all about the Body Snatcher history and whatnot. I also caught Downfall on TV and watched the entire movie, or should I say the entire performance (it really is actor driven) and I'm now questioning my thoughts of the director, Hirschbiegel, is he really that good a director? The Invasion certainly doesn't support that argument, OR was his film just messed around with and his version could possibly be good? There seems to be some kind of message many critics have mentioned, that seemed to get lost along the way, saying there is a good movie dying to get out. All I see is the typical "violence is part of human nature" which was also a message of Transformers. In fact, I think Optimus Prime delivers a bit of a speech on the subject, and dialog isn't even a true strength of the Michael Bay movie!!"For better or worse, we're human again..." said by random person of some kind of authority at the end. It was the best moment of the whole mess, but it lasted about 7 seconds.The 1956 original film was so horrifying to me as a kid back in the 90's (tv land rocked) I mean, I just really liked the Twilight Zone and Star Trek. Science Fiction is one of the largest genres, not that its most popular (it isn't) but it's one of the largest in variation. It varies the most from being funny and corny (B-Movies) or thought provoking and apocalyptic. What I was originally meaning to say was what I found horrifying about the 1956 original. It was the simple idea that your body is taken over and this alien claims not only your body, but your life! I have had countless nightmares, and I'm sure others have as well where I'm not in control of my body, I can't run or speak and have no control over moving. Kind of like being in zero gravity where you aren't in control of what your body does, the latest example of this occurrence is in the most impressive Danny Boyle film, Sunshine. It fascinated and horrified me, unlike Jurassic Park or Jaws which I couldn't watch because I'd be scared out of my mind in a way I never wanted to experience again. (Okay, this is when I was much younger) But instead, I wanted that feeling again when I watched Invasion of the Body Snatchers. There were no creatures with big teeth, in fact the aliens are never shown! Kind of like in Alien what you don't see can scare you. The expressionless faces frightened me.Call me too preoccupied by seeing what the problems and faults of The Invasion are because I'm a fan of the original, and I came to annoy the people who don't bother with the black and white, but consider this: Have you fully appreciated the origin of the magnificent story or could you spend less than an hour and a half to see the gem?I've had a very rough year at the movies, everything I like flops, I'm upset about the pushed back releases of Sunshine four months when it could've been released in March. What's really sad is The Invasion actually made more in its opening than Sunshine did in its entire run. Pathetic. The only other sci fi horror that will hopefully please me will be The Mist (NO, not similar to The Fog) which is the director of Shawshank/Green Mile. I just wish movies that actually depend on an audience to think and reflect are treated better by the marketing campaigns... not sent back to get reshot and messed with. Why can't a person's work be judged without being juggled around by 15 other people? This movie should have been given a better chance, it should have been good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>thats about it, weak.you felt no connection with the characters what so ever, there wasn't any really build up and/or climax. It was just, heres the characters, heres the zombies, movie over. It ended way too quick, the acting was nothing spectacular. The few parts that were meant to give you that little chill up the spine were worthless, a 6 year old could have laughed throughout this movie. The original, the black and white version is a much better film and is worth while to watch. Save yourself a few bucks and rent the original, don't watch this.I only gave it the 4 stars i did because some of the setting was interesting, and there were a few interesting filming angles, other than that. Stay home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't give it a zero? No, aw bummer... I gave this a shot because it is a remake of Body Snatchers which is John Carpenter at his finest so I had high hopes. This movie totally ruined my memories of the original which actually gave me nightmares for a few days when i was a kid. This is such a piece of Nicole Kidman garbage! The best (or worst) part of this crap-fest is they changed the way the aliens clone the humans. In the original they come in the form of a pod like thing that sits next to the victim and clone them while they sleep-totally creepy! In this 'sorry excuse for a remake', the aliens puke yellow crap on the victims in almost a comical way. My wife and I were laughing it was so dumb and corny. Don't worry, that isn't a spoiler either because it happens 20 minutes into the movie and doesn't spoil anything. Wow, what complete crappola!!! Story sucked, character development sucked, acting sucked, etc. I should have watched in fast forward, I prob wouldn't have missed a thing. OK I think thats enough...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The translation of Invasion of the Body Snatchers into this new movie completely transforms the film from Sci Fi scary to a cliffhanger suspense movie. The original Body Snatchers and its excellent Donald Sutherland starring remake were true Science Fiction, relying not so much on thrills as on terror and the thought that "maybe this could happen". This new one is definitely not in the same genre, as the Sci Fi element has been reduced to more of a suspense a la Breakout. Perhaps I would have liked the movie a bit more if I did not know the originals, which were true classics.Best thing about this movie is of course Nicole Kidman, but you can see her in many better films!</fullReview>

The modern technology theme is great with text messaging and virus genetic bug which reprograms ones DNA. The Invasions philosophy discussed by the Russian at the dinner party that man is still the animal which in the right circumstances will commit horrific act to advance or survival s is proved with the mother child bond where Kidman kills several to save her child. The contrast of the soulless body snatcher creating world peace, shows a world without feelings. The ending is positive but bitter sweet. 8 out of 10. Worth a movie night out of the house.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Other Versions Aside, a Good Movie Unto Itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, I've have never seen the original versions of this film; I've never read The Body Snatchers, so I came into this with no expectations. With a set off fresh eyes I found this film too rather brilliant. Was it necessary a cut and dry sci-fi film? No. Gory and terrifying horror film? No. It had some elements of an alien film, and some mildly scary parts, but mostly gave the viewer a smart, nuanced performance that you rarely see in a sci-fi-horror movie. The Invasion is neither: it is a t-h-r-i-l-l-e-r. This movie was so badly rated because it did not adhere to a Hollywood classic. I don't think that it set out to copy the previous film, but just to turn a really creepy concept into something more believable. Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig were electric together and gave some of this most convincing performances I've seen in this genre. This movie is redefining with a move with a sci-fi-horror premise can be. Saying that this movie doesn't work would be like saying the latest Casino Royale was bad because the characters weren't two-dimensional. Gratuitous sex, gore and violence is great when Tarantino does it, but usually is just there to keep a viewer watching a stupid movie. The Invasion gets you thinking about the good and bad of being human, I'll take that over an unoriginal re-make any day- no matter how good the first one is. It wasn't broke so they didn't fix it, they made something with first and second The Body Snatchers as inspiration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, we have all seen this movie concept at least three times previously. Even the star power of Kidman cannot overcome an attempt to use fast moving action scenes to disguise the lack of everything in this flick. Hollywood must be in such a dry spell in that all it can produce are sequels and revisions of old sequels? No wonder all the real actors are living or working in London? Today, the best bang for your buck is in the Independent Film category where the audience is at least given the doubt of owning a brain. The aliens in this one wouldn't cut it on the original sets of the Star Trek movies. Save your money and find an art house theater and enjoy something worth the $10 bucks. Boaring is an understatement.Rose of DC saying skip this flick!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delivers some new ideas but still falls short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As you probably know, this is the 3rd (or 4th if you count the TV film) remake of the original movie. I had high expectations but then again, when was I ever pleased with a remake? Actually the 78 version of the same movie is quite good but probably the definitive version of the story. **************The following Review contains MILD SPOILERS************* The Invasion changed some essential, basic elements of the original movie and took the plot to a different direction. For instance, aliens are not copying bodies anymore. Instead, aliens are just virus that take over the body during sleep. This allows the possibility of treating the victims. In the original, once the body is duplicated, the original body is disposed of and gone for good. Once the alien has taken over, there is no turning back. The invasion, on the other hand, allows treatment and this idea brings something fresh to the plot. I kind of like this new perspective. However, I didn't like the way aliens were contaminating the coffee and offering them to people to pass the virus over to them. Those scenes didn't work for me. I thought it was silly, not mention disgusting in some scenes.I also didn't like the use of CGI to display the victim when taken over by the virus. I think a good makeup would do the job perfectly. But instead, they used CGI to give the effect that virus has taken control of the body showing person's face in a cocoon. Those scenes didn't work for me.I think Nicole Kidman was the best thing in the movie. Her acting was great as usual. But I didn't like the way the script was written for her kid that he had to say "I love you mom" like 5 times in the first 15 minutes. It seemed as if they couldn't think of any other conversation between them.Some scenes were nicely done but there is one particular scene that was silly. One of the kids is attacked by a dog; it happens all so fast, in a split second you see a ferocious dog (obviously shot separately), and then kid holds the dog's jaws together, that was a poorly executed and poorly edited scene that ruined the continuity of the moment. To make matters worse, when they take the boy home with blood on his face, they find out that he has not even been bitten, that it is not his blood. So whose blood was it? That was a very silly scene.One other positive thing I can say that this movie has more light than 78 version. You could see better.If you really want to see this story in the way it functions as a dark science fiction movie, I recommend The Invasion of The Body Snatchers 78 version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart retelling of a character driven sci-fi.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake of remakes and based on Jack Finney novel, thankfully The Invasion borrows more from Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) and as a plus doesn't try to recreate its daring chilling ending, coming up with its own penultimate finish.The supporting cast are great and include '78's Veronica Cartwright. It is a fine cast ensemble that reunites Jeffrey Wright and Daniel Craig in two effective roles as they help Carol Bennell played by Nicole Kidman find her son and stop a virus that is turning humans into 'perfect' emotionless shells of themselves.Already off to a head start, based on such excellent source material director Oliver Hirschbiegel brings David Kajganich interesting screenplay to life. It's subtle at times but injects plenty of foot and car chases. The on location shooting sells the tension as you see the city's people change. Make up effect are fantastic and not too overboard. The good use of lighting, camera angels backed up with a nail biting score helps to heightening the paranoia as everyone Bennell knows becomes one of 'them.' Kidman's endless supply of unnecessary fitted clothing and botox aside, she gives a good performance and despite some surprisingly already dated effects shots of microscopic virus the film is well crafted.Overall, if not compared to its predecessors, The Invasion ticks all the boxes as a retelling of a character driven, sharp, thrilling sci-fi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All you have to do is nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, that's an actual line in this. There are other silly ones. The dialog on the whole does have cleverness, but it does try too hard every now and then. This is one of the only versions of the story that I've seen; I suppose the only other "real" one of them is The Puppet Masters. I also have not watched anything else by this director. Chances are you already know the excellent concept(not claiming that this particular movie is responsible for it, I realize that it's over half a century old), and if you don't, I refuse to ruin it for you. I admit that this certainly could be creepier; however, this has got to be the most realistic approach, it updates the story rather well to present day, and I frankly admire the guts it took to put forth the message of this. The plot isn't bad, though I suppose I can't claim that it moves along all that nicely. This has a good pace, and it's not really boring at any point. Some may have been bothered by how much of a thriller this turned out to be(honestly, here and there, it borders on being an action flick). The suspense and tension are fairly solid. Not everything holds up, and this could maybe explain a little more(with that said, you can piece it together, and the details are thought up well). The characters(if not terribly memorable) are reasonably developed, if a tad of that is forced(the lead announces herself to be a feminist before we've particularly witnessed any signs thereof). Acting performances range(the kid's quite poor). While I can imagine that Kidman's accent is over the top, I can't determine it for sure. It was cool to experience Wright in two such different roles so close to one another(his part in Shaft). The script is smart, if not perfect, and there are several goofy portions. Attempts in this to be cute and sweet are largely successful, when it doesn't wind up being corny. The FX are great and not flashy. I would say the same for the cinematography and editing; the non-linear time-line works for this, I think. There is plenty of disturbing content, occasional violence with a minor amount of blood, infrequent moderate to strong language and a tiny bit of gratuitous eye-candy. The DVD contains four featurettes, all of which I will be reviewing on their separate pages here on the site. I recommend this to anyone who likes the idea, and it's probably best to not already be a fan of one of the others. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad "Invasion," overall, but it still has a lot of problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be totally fair, "The Invasion" is not a movie that I intended on liking very much. After all, I completely ignored it when it came out in theaters two years ago, I'm not a Nicole Kidman fan, and I just thought that Jack Finney's 1954 novel "The Invasion of the Body Snatchers" had seen its best screen adaptation in 1978 with Philip Kaufman's "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." It came on TV recently, so I had the chance to watch it.So what's the verdict? "The Invasion" is not a total failure. I mean, it's pretty suspenseful, but it relents on the terror with a rather pointless car chase late in the feature, and an optimistic ending that reminds the viewer of how low Hollywood standards have fallen in recent decades; they think that we as audience members want less, not more, and it's an assumption that really hurts us.The film opens with an eerie video montage that reminds us of the Columbia space shuttle disaster in 2003, when a space shuttle burns up upon reentry, and its remains are scattered all over the country from Washington, D.C., to Texas. It turns out that the scraps of the space shuttle are contaminated with an unknown microorganism of extraterrestrial origin, and pretty soon the government issues a quarantine of most parts of the country. Soon after, people who come into contact with the remains begin acting very strangely...Kidman plays Dr. Carol Bennell, whose ex-husband Tucker (Jeremy Northam) soon phones asking to see their son Oliver (Jackson Bond), after having been absent since Oliver was born. Tucker is acting very strangely himself, since he is a scientist who was asked by the military to study one of the retrieved pieces of the space shuttle. Soon afterward, the entire city of Washington, D.C. seems to have come under some sort of mass hysteria, and one of Carol's patients swears that her husband is not her husband. Other strange occurrences happen, as it seems that people in the city are falling victim to a viral infection that is altering their behavior as they sleep, and that is when Carol, her new beau Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig) are forced to go on the run to rescue Oliver and to avoid a deadly new threat to the future of mankind.German director Oliver Hirschbiegel makes his American debut here, and it seems that he does not have a firm enough grasp on the material to be ready for American film productions. The story stumbles through its motions and while I'm no fan of Nicole Kidman, she's one of the reasons why you keep watching the film (to be fair to her, it's one of her most tolerable performances, in my opinion, of course). She keeps "The Invasion" above the water, despite the preposterous liberties taken with the original material."The Invasion of the Body Snatchers" remains a terrifying sci-fi/scare-story that will forever be a great piece of science fiction literature. Philip Kaufman's "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" is the best adaptation by far, and "The Invasion" is mostly a disappointment, though it's not a bore."The Invasion" is not a total failure, or a bore, it was just yet another un-needed adaptation of a famous sci-fi/scare-story.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>False-feeling ending damages but doesn't quite ruin another interesting Body Snatchers remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched on the big screen at the Cinema 9 in South Burlington, VT on first release. Right from the start you can see one of the major influences on the film-making here, and it isn't Don Siegel. The fracturing, quick-cutting, almost strobe-lit initial scenes with psychiatrist Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman) trying to find something to keep herself awake in a seemingly bombed-out pharmacy call to mind "28 Days Later" more than anything else, and much of the rest of the film seems indebted to that recent hit in its flashy lighting and camera-work, paranoia, and vision of a large city (Washington DC in this case instead of London) decimated by a populace turned into...something else. That "other" in this case is caused by a virus brought back by the space shuttle which moves by fluid transmission; unlike the "rage virus" in the British film this particular critter doesn't take over until the victim has slept, in keeping with the 1956 original and the Jack Finney novel that preceded it. In the original (and subsequent filmings if I remember right) the alien intelligent resides in physical pods which are moved about and can be destroyed, but the end result is the same as one by one all the people close to Dr. Bennell (with the exception of her son, who proves to be a key player in the race against the clock to save the world) turn into soulless zombie-like members of a mass mind.This got a fair number of bad reviews, and while it's not a patch on the original which I watched again a couple of days later, it seems to me undeserving of some of the harshness. Kidman and Daniel Craig as her --conveniently knowledgeable about viruses -- scientist boyfriend are both fine as usual though the hysterical level of action doesn't give them much time for emoting or reflection, and the political subtext (we are all turning into mindless pod people) is as relevant as it's ever been. It does have some very serious problems, but the most notable one is the very quick wrap-up, including a totally ludicrous car chase that goes to that edge of disbelief normally reserved for Die Hard and superhero movies. Had some of the earlier parts been trimmed a bit, had slightly more attention been given to scenes like Kidman's escape from her office after her secretary has been turned, and the finish been wrapped up in a slightly less spectacular but more ambiguous manner (like the original) I think this would be getting more notice from both public and critics. You'd think they would have learned that a happy ending is NOT what this story calls out for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was fair; however, I didn't care for the ending. It's like they find a cure for the virus using people who are immune and then all of a sudden everyone is cured. It went by to fast.The movie begins with doctor Carol Bennell, played by Nicole Kidman. She drops her son off with her ex husband. She finds it strange that he called out of the blue wanting to see him. She has a patient whom swears her husband is acting strange and it's like a different person. On the street people begin looking robotic. Police are taking people and their are lines to get a vaccine. She teams up with a fellow doctor, Ben, and another lab guy. They realize some people seem to be immune. Also, she can not fall asleep because that is when the virus takes over if you are infected. Carol must try to save her son and herself.We get a lot of chase scenes and a few things that make you jump. The story was OK as well as the acting, but the film just seemed to lack oomph and a really stand out scene.FINAL VERDICT: If you like Kidman, you will like this, but it isn't a great suspense story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made but lacks tension.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a rather well made and good looking 4th, modern, updated, Invasion of the Body Snatchers version that however lacks the tension and mystery that made the first 2 earlier versions so great.It's not as if the movie doesn't try but the end result is comparable to the 2005 version of "War of the Worlds". It's good looking all, fine acted, directed and whatever more but it doesn't know to grab you and suck you into the story. Because of this the movie remains mostly bland to watch.The movie doesn't keep its mystery for very long. It's pretty obvious early on into the movie what is going on and it doesn't take a long time for the main characters to actually 'believe' and tries to fight the evil. This also already takes away some of the tension of the movie.This movie didn't seemed like a logical next step for director Oliver Hirschbiegel, who had made the Hitler drama "Der Untergang" previously before this. This was also actually his first English language debut. but I must say he did a good job with this movie. The studio executives however though otherwise and brought in the Wachowski brothers for a rewrite and James McTeigue to direct some new scenes, after this movie already got first wrapped up in 2006. No doubt they added some more action and pace into the movie, which I must say wasn't a bit choice but it however also doesn't exactly make the movie any more tense. Who knows, perhaps the original Hirschbiegel was a whole lot more tense actually. Perhaps it focused more on the psychological and mysterious elements of the movie, of which the movie still shows some small tendencies.You can also wonder if some of the 'modern' updates for this movie version were actually really needed. Besides mobile phones and text massaging, the movie also makes terrorist reference as if the movie also tried to make a statement, which in the end just doesn't really come through.The lead is played by a female this time; Nicole Kidman, who doesn't do a bad job but also seems a bit lost at times. Daniel Craig's role is perhaps a bit too limited and perhaps the movie could had used some more prominently featured characters. The movie now instead only mostly focuses on Kidman and occasionally but not consistently Craig.Wachtable enough but you can also easily do without this version.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Invasion revelation : same concept, different take</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Invasion is the fourth iteration of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", itself based on a 1955 novel by Jack Finney. As the others, it is not a sequel but a thriller with science-fiction elements. The common point being that people are replaced, "snatched", by some kind of extraterrestrial entities, the rest being quite different. Those "snatched" people look the same and mostly act the same but in a cold unemotional way. This having been made in 2007, it plays on our fears of microbes and pandemics. I enjoyed also the subtext about terrorism and media propaganda. If a similar thing occurred, it's certain the media would be a choice weapon as they are in all conflicts. I found interesting how it seemed that such a quiet gradual underground invasion could potentially bring about world peace. The extraterrestrials make a good case for their actions instead of just being evil critters.It's not a flashy spectacular sci-fi film by any means, it's a lot more psychological and restrained. Those unemotional people, especially the husband in the waiting room, can be downright creepy. You also have the fun of trying to guess who has been "snatched" or not although this wasn't exploited very much. Nicole Kidman is excellent at showing distress with her non-verbal acting. There are a few very good sequences where she must blend in yet her eyes convey a lot. The son, who I thought was going to be one of those annoying preppy kids you see in ads all the time, turned out to be not so bad. In terms of directing, there were dynamic cuts alternating between the now and close future which I hadn't really seen before. There was an illogical sequence where the car of the heroine drives toward police cars who don't try to stop her, just after she managed to somehow avoid pursuing police cars in hot pursuit. However, there's also a nice original stunt with lots of people on top of a rolling car. I was annoyed by obvious product placements that took me out of the story. Invasion is quite good although you can't help but wish it packed an even more powerful dramatic punch.Rating : 6.5 out of 10 (good)</fullReview>

But everyone's a critic, and personally, this movie wasn't that bad.Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig pulled off a great performance, and the story rarely slowed down or moved slowly at all. While seeing it, I was into the sorrow Nicole Kidman's character was feeling, and all the emotions and kissy kissy goo-goo moments weren't even that bad and didn't bother me. The story was good, not great, and the climax was acceptable.Yet, there are some cons. And unfortunately, one of them is the biggest flaw this movie has. It's not nearly as good as the original. Having seeing it, I observed that the remake was it's own movie entire, and didn't show much appreciation to the classic. Also, the soundtrack is unremarkable and some of the actors are laughably bad... but only a few of them.Overall, this was a solidly pulled off sci-fi remake, and while its probably not worthy enough to be owned on DVD, this is a great kick-back movie that you can watch on late night cable.Not nearly as good as the original, but still very satisfying. Go check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another remake--and not a necessary one--though a fairly gripping thriller for two-thirds of the way...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A space shuttle disaster starts a deadly chain of events for lives down on Earth when materials from the wreckage, contaminated with alien spores, fall to the ground and are handled by humans; soon, a lookalike race begins taking over (the change occurs when the victim is sleeping), forcibly contaminating others with their fluids. This means Nicole Kidman, who survived a dalliance with "The Stepford Wives", battles emotionless automatons once again, however this is a much better picture (with no camp relief). Based on Jack Finney's novel "The Body Snatchers", the film isn't up to the classic standards of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" from 1956, suffering overall from jittery editing which keeps flashing forward in time (cooling out the central circumstance in the process). There are two sequences later in the film that do not work: a long, pointless scene where Kidman and her child are cornered by her ex-husband, as well as a late-night showdown in a pharmacy which fails to punch up the intended paranoia. This entire story should be underlined from start to finish with prickly paranoia and urban angst, though it's really too smooth and glossy to achieve this. Kidman is very good as a psychiatrist caught in the nightmarish web, even if the character isn't defined by the writing, and a few of the supporting players are strong. On the other hand, Daniel Craig and Jeffrey Wright have thankless roles, and the abrupt finale is terribly uncertain (with the plot worked out logically yet unhappily so). **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure and simple!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake is just pure and simple. Plenty of suspense, lots of intensity, not a lot of hoopla, just good fun. In "The Invasion", Nicole Kidman puts a show that has everyone talking. Everyone remembers "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", this version doesn't have to deal with "pod" people, but it does have to deal with an alien virus that spreads out following a space disaster. It's not easy knowing who's normal and who infected. Kidman plays a shrink whose son has an immunity to the alien virus. She tries her best to stay alert and not fall asleep. But she planned ahead when she tells her son to use the needle filled will adrenaline. There are others who are with her who helps eradicate the plague. It's a movie that's not all the same like the others in the past. Two remakes, and sexually intense version of the movie has came out. This one is tamer, and fun to watch. 3 out of 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many good films nowadays and there are many good thrillers with a real sharp plot, real growing suspense and real intrigue. The Invasion is no exception. It is a fairly good movie, with excellent Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig starring. But while Craig is often blunt, Nicole really saves the day, she makes the film so superb and so great at suspense. Her play is excellent throughout and she shines in both lyrical, delicate family scenes and dark, horrifying thriller scenes. The very idea of a sleep and the infection is very fresh and the end makes the whole film even better, especially when we get to know the details of the illness. Nicole is also very good as a Mother and as a psychologist. She delivers her parts very well and there is a real Old school of play that helps her be so marvelous here</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Invasion starts as the spaceship Patriot crashes to Earth just outside Washington, federal agencies are all over it &amp; soon make the shocking discovery that the debris is covered with alien spore. Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman) works in Washington as a psychiatrist &amp; has a session with a woman named Wendy Lenk (Veronica Cartwright) who claims that her husband is not really her husband anymore &amp; has been replaced with an emotionless copy, at first Carol finds it hard to believe &amp; just gives Wendy some more pills. However Carol soon realises that the alien spore is taking over people while they sleep turning them into cold emotionless alien copies, Carol also discovers that her young son Oliver (Jackson Bond) is immune to the alien virus &amp; somehow must stay awake in order to save Oliver &amp; get him to Government scientist who can use him to create a cure...This American Australian co-production was initially directed by German born filmmaker Oliver Hirschbiegel although once he delivered his final cut the producer &amp; studio didn't like it &amp; at a reported cost of $17 million James McTeigue was brought in to do extensive re-shoots, after learning of this one might imagine The Invasion would turn out to be a disaster but I actually rather liked it. Based on the novel 'The Body Snatchers' by Jack Finney &amp; adapted by Hollywood on no less than three occasions already The Invasion ditches the alien pods &amp; substitutes &amp; more plausible alien spore, the idea of people being taken over, the whole 'who can you trust' angle &amp; the notion that if you go to sleep you will be taken over by an alien is strong material &amp; you can see that during the first 70 odd minutes that Hirschbiegel directed he went for a sense of mounting dread &amp; suspense as Carol slowly notices little things around her as the alien virus takes control while when the re-shot last twenty minutes kick in it's all about spectacle &amp; wrapping the story up as quickly &amp; neatly as possible with a horrid ending where our saviour the US military come to the rescue &amp; the alien virus is defeated &amp; everything returns to normal, in fact I would say my least favourite aspect of The Invasion is the cop-out happier than happy ending which resolves things far too quickly &amp; far too nicely. There's also been a strong social &amp; political slant in all of the previous body snatcher films, the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) played on American fears of Communist infiltration while here there are constant references to the Iraq war &amp; feuding nations which, when the aliens take over, is ended &amp; it seems that peace comes at the cost of our humanity &amp; freedom which you can take whichever way you want to.While the first two thirds of The Invasion is all about a steady &amp; paranoid build-up the final third is all car chases, smashing windows &amp; shooting guns as Hollywood demanded more action. The transition is quite sudden &amp; a bit jarring but I liked both sides to the film although the final twenty minutes do get a bit much with running alien bad guy's &amp; burring cars screeching down roads. The CGI effects are good, disappointingly there's little in the way of scares as only two brief transformations are seen &amp; more could have been made of them &amp; the vomiting infected. No-one meaningful really dies either which that happy ending sees to. Competently made I did find myself enjoying this despite the universally negative reviews I read &amp; not bothering with ti at the time of it's initial release a few years back.With a supposed budget of about $80,000,000 this looks good &amp; I have no complaints about effects or production values either. I was impressed with Nicole Kidman in this, I thought she was great &amp; at 40 years old when she made this she looked great too. Soon to be James Bond actor Daniel Craig is alright while Veronica Cartwright one of the star's of the 1978 film Invasin of the Body Snatchers has a small role here.The Invasion is not a perfect film by any means but I did enjoy it's measured build-up &amp; all out action packed final twenty minutes, I thought Kidman was great &amp; I don't really have any great complaints except the original's are better &amp; that horrible happy Hollywood ending spoilt it a bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They snatch us all with peace and pancakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One more invasion in the history of the cinema ? Banal. But this one is not that banal because it really updates the fear. Not invaded by some kind of ugly green monster, please. Nor an egg laying alien. Let's be more modern and be invaded by something that is invisible and yet kind of ugly. Or rather gross, like some expectoration from a throat invaded by a serious infection. Gooey, gluey, inducing vomiting more than attraction. At the same time, beyond the bla bla about the DNA and its reprogramming when the subject is falling asleep, there is another myth: peace. To transform the most brutal and ferocious surviving animal species on earth and probably in the whole universe if not cosmos into a peaceful, peace loving and peace seeking bunch of automata. That's a dream for sure. Why not after all, to finally be able to love everyone and to forget and forgive all the evil the others have done to us, even if we have done to them maybe things that were worse. The peace you can only find during a funeral, provided no one has drunk himself or herself into a tantrum. That kind of future is frightening because you do not control yourself any more and also because there would be no fun in life any more, since fun is adventure, cops and robbers, wars, torturing chambers, dungeons, and a few dragons for fun on top of it all to crown the ice-cream with a nice cherry, you know the cherry you have forcefully taken from your neighbor yesterday night in the garden, though you just can't remember neither the sex, nor the age, nor the name or identity of that neighbor who just was there next to you when you had a sudden desire to eat a cherry and break it in. We can't really take that kind of fun away from all of us. Some of us need that fun, and I may say that maybe most of us need it. The film plays on that very well, till there is no escape what-so-ever, and there the film becomes a quick shortcut to a palatable end, after getting a glimpse of George W. Bush on TV. The poor woman and her son will manage to kill a few regenerated human beings who are no longer human, then she or they will kill a couple of dozens more ,and finally escape in a chopper that was handily flying by, and then on the following frame everything is back to normal, a vaccine has been found and the millions of weirdo sickly mutants have been brought back to normal. It is so nice to go back to school, to have pancakes that are not burnt, etc. The suspense is OK, the story is nothing phenomenal, Nicole Kidman wears and carries or even bears her name well, oscillating between the frenzy of a kid and the determination of an adult, but with a touch of French looking erratic psychosis. It is probably not worse than the old "Body snatchers" and the more recent remake of "The War of the Worlds". Just entertaining, though not that much inspiring.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen each and every Invasion of the Body Snatcher films, this 2007 version "The Invasion" was the best. The original was great for it's time back in the 1950's, and the remake of the 1970's with Donald Sutherland was the best at that time. The 1990's version, "Body Snatchers" with Forest Whitaker was so so. This new 2007 version used believable aspects, spores attaching themselves to the space shuttle while in orbit. In reality - decontamination is a vital process in regards to space flight, but in this story the shuttle broke up on re-entry before decontamination could take place. To bad it had to reflect on the 2003 Columbia disaster, but it is understandable and done with good taste. I think if you haven't seen "The Invasion", and have seen other versions, you really must see this new version - you will be satisfied.thanna</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best movie i've seen this year,but was alright!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing I noticed is that the movie suddenly without warning or an introduction by whatever company put the film out(whether it's universal,Lions gate,paramount etc)it started and I thought it was another trailer.You barely even notice the words the invasion and then you see Nicole Kidmans character acting frantic and freaked out.And then you see a few other characters in what seems normal until suddenly someone wakes up from a bad dream and then it starts off.I have never been a fan of movies that start like that with the dramatic action scenes in the film first and then proceed to start from the beginning whether it's 2 years earlier or 24 hours earlier.I like to be surprised later in a movie and have it start from the beginning and then build from there. After about 10 minutes into the movie it got started from a point that stayed consistent to the rest of it.Nicole Kidman's character seemed annoyingly obsessed with her own son and he with her,and I don't think that's very healthy.It's not realistic and I don't know anyone who acts that way.I also don't like to see a mother deprive her son of a relationship with his father and she was trying to do that.Whether intentionally funny or not there is a scene near the end where the whole theater laughed when Kidman's character picks up this Jap kid(or maybe he was Chinese)who was under the influence of the Alien intelligence and threw him like a rag doll and he hit the ground hard. I guess it was a typical sci-fi action movie that we have all seen before.I didn't know it was a remake of invasion of the body snatchers until I read reviews.I did see that movie but it has been so long I forgot most of it.One thing I don't like about American films that use British and Australian actors is that they never let them use their own accent, especially when there are lots of Brits living all over North America.I noticed most of the actors in the movie were British,and that a few of the American actors were playing Russians.I guess I prefer a movie to be more authentic. It wasn't the worst movie i've seen but I could have waited for DVD for this one.It was nothing spectacular either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless and cold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This retread of the fifties sci-fi film changes a number of the original plot elements, and in the process loses the point of the original. The original made it rather clear that the alien idea was conformity and following the herd. In this film, it looked as though the alien virus suddenly caused peace in the world. Is the filmmaker trying to be fair and balanced, showing us both sides of the issue? It undercuts the impact of the film--maybe a total planet take-over wouldn't be all that bad, as long as one's child is safe. The original had something to say and said it forcefully; this one just mumbles.Furthermore, the film undercuts whatever point of view it has by tacking on an abrupt happy ending, which seemed almost as foreign as the virus.I think the use of a space shuttle disaster to bring the virus to earth is unnecessary, tasteless and insensitive. I think the rather detailed monologue from a psychiatric patient about how her husband strangled their pet dog is unnecessary, tasteless and insensitive. I think the scene were a pod child fractures a dog's skull is unnecessary, tasteless and insensitive. Not to mention the current cliché of computer-generated car collisions with pedestrians.I don't regret seeing the film, and it is not boring. Just pointless and cold.</fullReview>

And what has Nicole Kidman done to her face, or was it always like this ? Looks as if they hired a make-up artist only for her in the movie. While all the other actors around her look normal, she seems to be always with some work done on her face with heavy lipstick. I recommend you do not waste your money on this movie.

Produced in 2007, the producers could not help themselves into jamming their political beliefs unto an unsuspecting public in order to help elect Obama. First it was the CNN reports on the "occupation of Iraq", then the Equal Pay Act rally that Nicole Kidman just happens to walk past (she's driven to work but dropped off 2 blocks away from her office). Then you get to listen to an argument for evolutionary psychology (how we learn and become moral without God)finished off with a thumbs up for post-modern feminism (the world is better off without men).

		<shortDescription>Worth A Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most reviews rightly compare this movie with earlier 'Bodysnatcher' works. And it's evident that the directors drew heavily from them. All of which is a shame, because this effort is fairly good in its own right.The infected spaceship crashing back to earth is also a concept pioneered by Nigel Kneale in 'The Quatermass Experiment' Whilst he likewise explored the subtle take-over of humanity in 'Quatermass 2'. In the meantime, Carpenter reviewed the invasion of human tissue by a viral-like agent (from yet another crashed spaceship) in his classic remake of 'The Thing'. Whilst being relentlessly pursued by 'different' humans is a feature of just about every 'zombie' outing you care to shake a stick at, not to mention big Chuck's 'Omega Man'. Then again; the paranoia of isolation and containment was adequately represented in 'Outbreak' and 'The Andromeda Strain'.So, a sense of de-ja-vu tends to pervade just about every aspect of the movie. And for this reason, its makers should perhaps have tried a little harder to get away from such well-worn tracks.Nevertheless, I began to enjoy the thing once it got going. The biological techno-babble grew a little tiresome - there always seems to be just one smart-arse in every movie like this. And there were just a few too many chases when intelligent action was called for. Though that said they're a very good way of involving the audience in the plight of its heroes and heroines. The latter competently played by Nicole Kidman. On the plus side, money wasn't squandered on tiresome CGI excess and unnecessary pyrotechnics. Special effects were minimalist and believable. The non-babble script was competent if not exactly clever. And all other technical issues were pretty much on the mark.I thought the ending was a bit of an anti-climax. Suddenly the stars are whisked away in a helicopter and from then on, a narrative voice-over explains that everything's more or less fine. It wasn't exactly a down-to-the-wire experience for humanity after all.Finally, it wasn't made clear (to me) as to why this virus only infected humans, whilst pet dogs (for example) could apparently detect it and respond negatively. Why did they do this? Evolutionarily speaking, to an extra-terrestrial organism humans and dogs would seem almost identical.Anyway, it drew me in and I watched it through. It was better than I expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasant surprise (after all the reviews)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This premise has been done over and over and over again in the last six decades and we, as an audience, never really tire of it. When this movie, its predecessor(s), or any derivation thereof is the subject of conversation, much is always made of the subtext of the story - communism, fundamentalism, etc. That's fine. We get it.Then, of course, there's the face-value horror of an alien infection or invasion. That premise has been done over and over again in the genre as well. Why? Well, because it's just plain scary.But honestly, what's genuinely frightening to me in these films is the big picture that rests comfortably behind all the blatant horror and the subconscious fear of the loss of individuality. That big picture shows us what sci-fi has taught us many times in many films... Utopia cannot exist without the loss of our souls. "To imagine a world where this was not so, where every crisis did not result in new atrocities, where every newspaper is not full of war and violence." It's the dream of many to see such a world. But the character in this film sums it up when he caps it off with, "Well, this is to imagine a world where human beings cease to be human." These films tell us that we're doomed to be who we are - forever. Otherwise, to hope for vast, sweeping change is to hope for sheer horrors beyond our imagining...or maybe we *have* already imagined it.I gave The Invasion 9 out of 10 due to its rushed ending and its lack of the "Body Snatcher Screech". Opening reviews of this film were way off as far as I'm concerned. Well worth my two hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Invasion (2007) is not only a-run-of-the-mill flick that borrows heavily ideas from old movies and try to sell them as new rags, it also fails to keep up with contemporary global outlook in that it irresponsibly portrays villains as black hair and of Nazi and foreign appearances. In the post-911 era, an elderly senior lecturer in Malaysia said "American deserves 911 because when I was growing up, black people are always cast as the baddies in all the Hollywood films". I don't agree with him, but I can see where these sentiment are coming from. Therefore I think movies like Invasion (2007) would just add to more anti-west fodder.I would like to urge the producers and all those who are involved in making this film to please think before you do anymore harm, if not for yourself, at least have consideration for the future generation for their chances to live in peace with the other people on this fragile planet.</fullReview>

What "The Invasion" has is the element of thrill, urgency and the feeling of hopelessness when you are fighting against the odds. The story is simple which is a good thing, as i usually find science fiction films too complicated and confusing to understand. "The Invasion" had me engaged most of the time. I was on edge and wanted more of the plot to unfold. While the character development is not so good and the performances are rather bland, these are not the most essential things that make a science fiction film work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe all the bad negative comments on AMAZON . com on this film. Yes..I've seen all the previous "Invasions". Even both "War of the Worlds"..and even "Plan 9 from Outer Space" and how can we forget "The Shining".Is it because it doesn't have an open ending like the other ones as this one has more closure on the storyline of the "Invasion" films in the past I can appreciate also the slower "thought" process of this version. The creepiness of these people once transformed and how well they hide their alien-selves. This storyline allows for the audience to learn more insightful thoughts of the "aliens" and their viewpoints than in previous versions.The intro dinner scene of the Doctors thoughts on "progressive thinking" is brilliant..it's an insightful poignant conversation eluding to a way of thinking most humans are blinded of based on "their" current living era and of cultures.I don't think this movie could've been played by younger actors. Seasoned actors and Nicole Kidman was a good choice.I have also noticed, in the past 20 years..a lack of appreciation for slower developing plots in films. Or is it lack of "attention span" when someone isn't always getting "whacked" on the screen or cars getting smashed.I think what one has to ask when viewing sci-fi films..is "Is this what I would do if I was her/him?" AND How much fact is going to validate the storyline in this created world.I think very few sci-fi films allow for full believability. This is of them that satisfies.I'm finding so many flaws in the new Star Trek and Terminator story lines.Such as in Star Trek..I don't find it realistic that a Starfleet Officer would eject and "chuck" a student (in a pod) to a death planet where he would be eaten by huge powerful ferocious creatures! Spoiler (for Terminator and Star Trek) Terminator: I can't see "anti-rejection" drugs being available to organ donors in a post nuke setting! Which invalidated the WHOLE movie right at the end!.I felt this this version of "Invasions" satisfies completely on this level.I didn't feel like I was being treated as a complete retard while watching it! I enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a parallel to this plot line in our current reality. It can be seen in the dynamics of the corporate culture, which has resulted in a number of movies over the years. 'Professionalism' is the new religion. I.e. show no emotion, feelings, and don't go to sleep. The protocol is global with a few cultural variations. They "frame mischief by a law". The illusion of the so-called "greater good" is perpetuated through an educational system that is specialized and permeated with 'sameness'. Our generations are now systematized and not educated; ignorance prevails. "There is no premium on ignorance." The cure requires something quite radical, and costly, and involves more than just "Saying 'No'". Perhaps it can begin with a psychologist, God knows He has yet to find an American culture preacher.

		<fullReview>Hey, wait a second. I've seen this film before ? in fact, I've seen it twice. The plot was first witnessed in the 1956 sci-fi classic, "Invasion of the Body Snatchers," then in its 1978 re-make.So, since both of these movies still exist in some form or another, there's absolutely no reason to shell out good money to see this dud.Here, Nicole Kidman (showing the acting talents she displayed in the "Stepford Wives," only not as frantic) plays psychiatrist Carol Bennell, who begins witnessing strange and unemotional behavior in her patients and colleagues after a space shuttle explodes.One woman, Veronica Cartwright, explains that her violent husband no longer beats her. "He doesn't love me anymore," she sobs. Oh, and he also killed the family dog.The evil organism ? which causes the world's enemies to sign multiple peace treaties ? goes to work while the victim is asleep. The Alien-like cocoons then awake like lobotomized store mannequins. Thus, being stoic and passionless means an alien organism has taken over the individual (so Al Gore is an extraterrestrial?!).Walking down the street and staring straight ahead, Bennell (who's searching Baltimore for her cute-as-a-button moppet, Oliver, Jackson Bond), fools enough of the infected to make her way to an Army base where Dr. Stephen Galeano (Jeffrey Wright, "Broken Flowers") is working on a cure.Support is given to her by another physician, Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig, "Casino Royale"), which makes the acting pedigree of this picture second to none. However, since the main premise here is for the lead characters not to fall asleep, one wonders why the audience isn't treated with the same respect.Only 93 minutes, this movie is nonetheless a tedious exercise in stilted writing, awkward pacing, bad editing and poor direction (blame Oliver Hirschbiegel in his American debut).Once again, unless all copies of either version of "Body Snatchers" are destroyed or otherwise missing, rent it and save yourself a lot of pain and money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicole Kidman is great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, this is a great movie, an excellent sci-fi flick. Excellent acting, taut script, interesting story, ongoing suspense and great action, all the ingredients that make for a highly entertaining movie. Of course, what makes this movie even better is the presence of Ms. Nicole Kidman, who proves once again that she is Hollywood's premier actress and easily the best looking. Not enough compliments can be made about Ms. Kidman. One must wonder why anyone would divorce such a talented, successful and fine-looking lady. Yes, beauty is skin deep, as the saying goes, and one cannot judge a book by its cover, according to another saying, but seeing is believing and success speaks for itself, and what I saw of Nicole Kidman in this intense and exciting movie is further proof that Ms. Kidman is not only a talented artist but is beautiful as well which is befitting a great actress who is truly a star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is sleek</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been tracking this movie's status since 2005, so I know everything about it. This movie has some very smooth cinematography. The colors are vivid and somewhat thrilling. The Invasion can be compared to War of The Worlds, but by far, it is so much better than Tom Cruise garbage. Nicole Kidman is stunning and delivers a somewhat frozen performance, but it is way better than Cruise's performance in War of The Worlds. I didn't get a sense of who Daniel Craig character was, though. Kidman and Craig do make a good pair. This is also Oliver Hirschbiegel's first movie in the US, so he brings a euro-German edge to the film. After all he did make one of the greatest movies ever made depicting the downfall of Hitler(the Oscar-nominated Downfall). One thing I have to mention is, this movie is pretty fast, so you have to keep your eyes open. There aren't any clunky special effects, just amazing stunts. That one car chase causing crew members to be hospitalized paid off. Oh, did I mention it was scary. Go see it. It's a perfect summer flick that won't bore you or hurt your eyes with exhausting CGI. Be thrilled. The main scares are just by the intense extra's that were snatched. My verdict is that this was a great sci-fi flick. Kidman kicks Cruise's butt. 10/10</fullReview>
