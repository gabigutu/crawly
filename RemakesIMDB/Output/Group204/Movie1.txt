		<shortDescription>Excellent genre film with intellectual subtexts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Miles J. Bennell (Kevin McCarthy) is called back to his small California home early from a conference because a number of his patients have been frantically asking to see him. But oddly, when he returns home, most forget about their unspecified needs. At the same time, it seems that a mass hysteria is building where residents believe that friends and loved ones are "not themselves", literally. Just what is going on? As of this writing, it has been more than twenty years since I have seen the 1978 remake of this film, so I can't compare the two at the moment. However, it would have to be flawless to top this, the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers.The sole factor that caused me to give the film less than a ten was the pacing during portions of the first half hour or so. While it's not bad, exactly, director Don Siegel does not build atmosphere and tension as effectively as he might have while the viewer is being filled in on the necessary exposition. Admittedly, this section is directed in a standard way for its era, but "standard" here is enough to subtract a point.However, once we reach Miles' friend Jack Belicec (King Donovan) discovering a body on his billiard table, the suspense and tension gradually increase, and the remainder of the film is a very solid ten.The literal "weapon" of the film's horror could have easily come across as cheesy, but it doesn't. Don Post and Milt Rice's special make-up effects and props are threateningly eerie. The transformation sequences involving the props are beautifully shot and edited--showing just enough to make them effective, but not so much that the mystery is gone.It was ingenious to create a story where a whole town gradually turns into a villain, and even natural, unavoidable biological functions threaten our heroes' destruction. In conjunction, it all creates an intense sense of claustrophobia and paranoia for the audience.McCarthy and Dana Wynter, as Miles' girlfriend Becky Driscoll, expertly convey a gradual transformation from common citizens to panic-stricken, desperate victims on the run. The film is also notable for slightly ahead-of-its time portrayals of relationships and divorce.Much has been said about the parallels between Invasion of the Body Snatchers and the "communist paranoia" in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s, especially as it was directed against Hollywood by the House of Un-American Activities Committee. (And how ironic that the star of Invasion of the Body Snatchers is named McCarthy?) However, there is another very interesting subtext present that isn't so often mentioned. The film can also be looked at as a philosophical exploration of personal identity. Just what does it take for people to be themselves? Is it how they look, act, the things they say? Is it not the case that people are constantly transformed into something they weren't just hours ago, or even moments ago? Among the many ways that these kinds of ideas are worked into the script is that sleep is a metaphor for unconscious physical change over time. It would be easy to analyze each scene in the film in this manner, going into detail about the various implications each plot development has on the matter of personal identity.Despite the slight pacing/atmosphere flaw in the beginning, this is a gem of a film, not just for sci-fi and horror fans, and not just for its era. It's worth seeing by anyone with a serious interest in film, and can be enjoyed either on its suspenseful surface level, or more in-depth by those who want to look at the film as more metaphorical material for societal and philosophical concerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Invasion Of The Body Snatchers' is THE 1950s paranoid SF/Horror classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Invasion Of The Body Snatcher's is my favourite 1950s science fiction movie alongside 'Forbidden Planet'. Both are very different movies. 'Forbidden Planet' is arguably the first SF blockbuster, an intergalactic adventure, in colour, with a large budget and impressive special effects. 'Invasion Of The Body Snatcher's is a smaller movie, a low budget black and white paranoid thriller that is a classic of its type. Many subsequent movies have been influenced by this one, and there have been at least two remakes (Philip Kaufman, Abel Ferrara), but it still takes some beating! Director Don Siegel is best known for tough guy crime dramas like 'The Killers' and 'Dirty Harry', but shows his versatility with this extremely effective and disturbing horror story. The legendary Sam Peckinpah had an uncredited hand in the script, and (keep an eye open for) a small cameo as a meter reader. Kevin McCarthy is terrific as the small town doctor turned hero. His performance is excellent, and made him a legend to SF and horror fans everywhere (he reprises it briefly in Kaufman's excellent 1970s remake by the way). The lovely Dana Wynter leads a strong supporting cast, and buffs will get a particular kick out of seeing Carolyn Jones (a.k.a. Morticia Addams) and Whit Bissell. ('I Was A Teenage Werewolf', 'Creature From The Black Lagoon' and too many others to mention!) This movie has aged very well, much better than say, 'The Thing From Another World', and still stands as THE 1950s paranoid SF/horror movie. An absolute classic that I guarantee still packs a punch! Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the scariest sci-fi films of the 1950s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A chilling motion picture, well directed by Don Sigel, with a script co-written by Daniel Mainwaring and (uncredited) Sam Peckinpah, based on the novel "The Body Snatchers" (aka "Sleep No More") by Jack Finney.The excellent musical score is by Carmen Dragon. Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter head the cast of this four-star classic in which the inhabitants of a small California town are being replaced by alien look-alikes. The aliens come to Earth in the form of "seed pods" that burst open and spew out a foam which grows into human duplicates, complete with all the memories of the original. The best scene in the film takes place in a greenhouse where several alien pods burst open and disgorge the half-formed copies of the horrified humans.A prologue, a new ending, and a voice over-narration were added after the film's initial release, to help the audience follow the strange plot. In the added scenes, the story opens with Kevin McCarthy being brought into a hospital, raving about alien invaders. Two doctors (Whit Bissell and Richard Deacon) listen to McCarthy's strange story, which the audience sees as a flashback. At the end of he movie the doctors are understandably skeptical about McCarthy's weird yarn, but an unexpected event lends credence to his story.Many film reviewers criticize these added scenes as unnecessary, an unwise attempt to conclude the story with a happier ending. But these scenes serve a valuable purpose, increasing the viewers sympathy for McCarthy and his efforts to convince someone that mankind is in danger. The alleged "happier ending" does not establish that mankind will win the battle against the aliens. It simply implies a Chapter Two in this epic struggle. Mankind will have a fighting chance in the war, but the outcome is definitely open to debate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Sci - Fi Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Allied Artists stunning INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS is arguably the finest Sci-Fi movie ever made. Produced in 1956 by Walter Wanger it was perfectly written for the screen by Daniel Mainwaring (who also wrote "Out Of The Past") which derived originally from the Colliers magazine story and then a novel by Jack Finney. Beautifully photographed in black &amp; white and in the short lived widescreen process Superscope by Ellsworth Fredericks the picture is a triumph on all fronts with bracing cinematic nous and expertise from all departments thanks to the committed and adroit direction by Don Siegel. This movie came from early in the great director's career. He had started off at Warner Bros. doing special effects on such things as "Casablanca"(1942) and "Edge of Darkness" (1943) before he started directing. His first feature to direct was the Sidney Greenstreet classic "The Verdict" in 1946 and then garnered great praise in 1954 when he directed Walter Wanger's tough and gritty prison drama "Riot In Cell Block 11". Latterly Siegel is better known for his association with Clint Eastwood for whom he directed some of the actor's most memorable films. In 1976 he directed John Wayne in his final film "The Shootist" and Siegel's own final film was the best forgotten Bette Midler vehicle "Jinxed" in 1983. Don Siegel died in 1991 but of all his films he will probably be best remembered for Wanger's two classics "Riot In Cell Block 11" and INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS.On his return home after attending a medical conference in the city a young small town doctor (Kevin McCarthy) finds some of his patients acting somewhat strangely. It is not too long before he discovers much to his horror that their very bodies have been taken over by an alien life form. Further investigation establishes the strange life form germinated in giant seed pods that were placed near their victims as they slept. Without any noticeable difference in their physical appearance the aliens perfectly replicated the human form with one exception the "new" beings have no human feelings or emotions. Soon everyone in the town is affected including the police and all of the doctor's friends. Now, together with his girlfriend (Dana Wynter), he must endeavour to escape from the town - get to the capital and warn the authorities. But in order to survive and make the journey they not only have to evade the now alien townspeople who are pursuing them en masse but ensure at all costs that they don't fall asleep.Although the cast is made up mostly of minor players the performances throughout are uniformly excellent. Kevin McCarthy - he of the chiseled-jaw - a fine character actor in anything he did is good here as the main protagonist imbuing his role with just about the right degree of fear and trepidation. The lovely Dana Wynter - she of the cute little upturned nose - is as attractive as ever in what must be her most memorable role. Also interesting are well measured portrayals from such minor actors as King Donovan, Carolyn Jones (in one of her early films), Virginia Christine, Larry Gates and Ralph Dumke as the police chief. And watch out for the unknown Sam Peckinpah in a tiny part as a meter reading gas-man and later towards the end - when an exhausted McCarthy finally reaches the busy freeway - Pechinpah leading the pursuers shouts "Let him go......they'll never believe him". There are also some lovely moments of pure film noir! Ellsworth Frederick's monochrome camera makes ingenious use of light and shadow, up and down narrow office corridors, McCarthy and Wynter hiding from the police in an office closet and particularly brilliant is the clip when the pair are silhouetted against the dimly lit wet streets and alleyways at night as they race hand in hand to escape their incredible nightmare. And holding the whole thing together is the splendid score - if perhaps a tad over emphatic - from composer conductor Carmen Dragon.INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS is not only a superb Sci-Fi adventure but more significantly it is an imaginative, intense and suspenseful thriller of a motion picture. The brilliance with which it steadfastly maintains to this day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't let the title fool you. This one is a classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the great movie allegories. Yes, it is an allegory on the McCarthy era. Yes, it is an allegory on conformist America. But it is also an allegory on the evils of communism and fascism. Yes, it is a plea for sanity and individualism, for creativity and artistic freedom. And again yes it is a great directorial achievement for Don Siegel. All that aside it is also an entertaining film that does what any great movie should do, it moves. The dialog is not stilted or full of clichés. It is original and insightful without becoming preachy. Was Kevin McCarthy chosen because his name was McCarthy and the film runs counter to McCarthism? I think he was chosen because he was one of the gifted actors of the 1950's whose talents were not fully realized by the film industry. His fellow actors and actresses in the movie shared the same fate. The movie is also a top notch thriller, as good as any Hitchcock. When you're talking about the films of the 1950's that help define the period only a few come to mind: "The Wild One," "Rebel Without A Cause," and "Bad Day at Black Rock" are often cited. But "The Invasion of the Body Snatchers" is the one to study. It epitomizes the American outlook and cold war hysteria of the era as no other film from the decade does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American cinematic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first watched this movie I was a teenager. I knew nothing about the Mcarthey era. I didn't live through the early post cold war paranoia. There were no outside influences aside from my love of movies. I have seen the film over 2 dozen times and believe it to be the best of the 50's generation, and one of the top 3 or 4 science fiction films of all time. With or without the prologue and epilogue.All things are not what they seem. What if you woke up from a nightmare to find that you are still in it, and can't get out. The message is clear. A home, a car, and a career are all great to strive for in one's life. But love, compassion and emotion are the true gifts to keep living in the first place. Imagine a home without love or any emotion what so ever. None. Good or bad. One by one, Kevin Mcarthy and Dana Wynter are confronted by the loss of neighbors, associates, and friends. The horror of the loss of everything they new. Early on, when a boy thinks his mother isn't his mother, and a friend doubt's her uncle is who he says he is. Doctor Miles is confused and doesn't know what to believe. So he goes with common sense. His eyes see there is no problem. But The evidence piles slowly and precisely. Soon it is not only what to believe, but who to trust.Kevin Mcarthy is outstanding. Dana Wynter is absolutely gorgeous and the chemistry between the two seems real. The film will keep you glued from beginning 'til end. Simply one of the best!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Word Only......Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Invasion of the Body Snatchers is the quintessential sci-fi film of the 50s, praying on the particular fears and paranoias of the time as well as more basic, instinctual phobias within each of us. The story is simple enough about a benevolent, intellectual doctor returning from vacation only to find that some weird, unexplainable feelings have been generated in the small town of Santa Mira. Some people say that relatives are not who they seem to be, despite being exact duplicates physically and mentally. This leads to one discovery to another for the good doctor, his girl, and two friends, and what we have through each discovery is one more piece to the puzzle that an alien presence is at work. What makes this film so successful is the pace and frantic mood it creates. We are caught up in Dr. Bennel's work, his fears and anxieties, his discoveries, and his uncovering of the truth. We feel confined, betrayed, and even suspicious of everything he encounters. Credit for this certainly must go to director Don Siegel and his outstanding ability to create this almost claustrophobic atmosphere, as well as to Kevin McCarthy who does an outstanding job playing the doctor. There are scenes in this film that live on long after viewing it...and the last one in particular has forever been etched into my mind. For a good fright, see Invasion of the Body Snatchers...They're here! They're here!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The simplicity of the horror is what "makes" this film so brilliant...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What must be considered one of the most original of all the science fiction films emanating from the '50s is INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, a low-budget sci-fi film about a sleepy Southern California town infested with a bunch of pods that are replicating the town's humans in physical form hatched from alien pods and taking over mind and body.It doesn't waste any time in getting to the core of the horror element, with McCarthy as a doctor invited to a friend's house where he sees the first evidence of a sleeping pod form taking on the shape and identity of another. He and his sweetheart (the beautiful DANA WYNTER) are soon aware of the situation enveloping the small town residents and make an effort to alert the authorities, but find that no one can be trusted to be whom they claim to be--and are soon on the run themselves.It easily remains one of the most gripping of these films with an excellent score by Carmen Dragon. KEVIN McCARTHY, DANA WYNTER, VIRGINIA CHRISTINE, WHIT BISSELL, KING DONOVAN and CAROLYN JONES all deliver fine performances and director Don Siegel keeps the suspense taut until the final scene.Summing up: Alien invaders have always been a big part of sci-fi stories but never quite as creepily as depicted here. Terrific suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The better one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first part of a double bill with Phil Kaufman's remake as the follow-up. I'll say that Siegel is ten times the action director that Kaufman could ever dream of being, that the original Body Snatchers has a cool, thoughtful tone that makes the shock scenes even better. The remake, even though in color and with a bigger budget, is so nervous, so lacking in pace and mood, that your impulse is often to laugh instead of sinking deeper into your seat. Take just one scene: Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter are barricaded in his office, trying to stay awake. Morning comes, and the weirdness begins; people shuffle towards the square to pick up their packages, the leaders calling out the districts. Now in daylight the suspense is made more potent, the threat to humans seems greater. Kaufman does this scene at night, losing the mundane horror that Siegel evokes so well. The studio imposed the flashback structure, having McCarthy brought in to talk to a therapist at the beginning and end of the picture. That's the only weakness in the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A doctor comes to a hospital on a late night call to hear a man whom everybody else deems insane. The doctor persuades the man to be patient and tell his story. The man then tells the doctor about how a small California town has been invaded by some sort of alien seeds that grow into human clones...Coming straight from the McCarthy era and general Cold War paranoia this is one scary movie. There is not a gun fired, not a drop of gore shed but the final effect of the film will stay with you for a good while. More contemporary film viewers might recognize the concept from John Carpenter's "The Thing" which itself was an update of the 1951 film. However, the themes of paranoia and tension are just as nail-biting and intense here.There is a lack of visual punch that so many people are used to today, but just think of the historical context and the implications, basically use your mind! Then you'll see why the film scared studio executives so much that they forced Don Siegel to add an intro and outro to help soften the overall effect. It wasn't the best play in the book, but the film remains a great classic chiller. --- 9/10Not Rated. It would most likely receive a PG from the MPAA, there are several tense moments, though no violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Exciting and Often Involving Noir Fantasy Thriller; Recommended</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The decision to make this fascinating novel into a noir thriller worked very well on its own merits as an "adventure" with mostly-implicit ideas as motivations; however, I believe the film could have been made into a dramatic work of unusual power, It is B/W, swift-paced, intelligently acted and unusually- well-directed by Don Siegel, with a literate script by Daniel Mainwaring. The project is also interesting and disturbing for a number of reasons. Jack Finney wrote a novel in the 1950s which some read as a loss of American individualism, and others as an attack on Cold-War mentality realpolitik. Whatever the wellsprings of this fine idea, Finney's story treated of "seeds from space"; the idea is that these came to Earth and have the power to reproduce themselves into any living thing's form, right down to its thought patterns, memories, etc. But of course they have no emotions--they are merely replicas, not the originals. A mass hysteria grips the town of Santa Mira, California, shortly after their secret arrival on our planet; and Dr. Miles Bennell is called home from a conference because a dozen people claim some relative or beloved friend is not who they were before. When this seems to die down, Miles has time to pursue old flame and lovely Becky Driscoll, now that both their divorces are final. But the problem does not disappear and cannot be explained away by a psychologist friend of Bennelle's, thoughtfully played by Larry Gates. Bennell and his friend Jack Belicec and his wife Teddie find a body on Jack's pool table; his wife think's it's an alien thing--to replace Jack. They three flee to Miles's house, and Bennell goes to get Becky--carrying her off into the night. The next day looks sunny and normal, except that they find huge seed pods in Bennell's greenhouse, turning into--something else. Or someone? The remainder of the film consists of Bennell trying to call for help, observing the distribution of seeds in trucks in the small town's center, being trapped in his office, overcoming two guards, fleeing, and losing Becky to the monsters, before he finally convinces authorities that he is not insane; this requires an accident--to a truck carrying giant seed pods, from Santa Mira. As Bennell, Kevin McCarthy is quite good if not ideal. Dana Wynter is classically good as Becky; King Donovan and Carolyn Jones are the Belicecs, she doing a great deal with little to work from. Ralph Dumke as the Police Chief and Virginia Christine as Becky's Aunt Wilma are also standouts. Others in the cast include Kenneth Patterson, Tom Fadden, Guy Rennie and Jean Willes as Bennell's nurse. The production values are all good, by my standards, but only the direction is outstanding, except for the special effects. Carmen Dragon supplied eerie music suitable to the action. The loss to the film occasioned by its being made as a frightening adventure can be gauged best perhaps by comparing the qualities of Raymond Chandler's The Little Sister with the enjoyable adventure-level film "Marlowe" made in the 1970s. What we have here is a taut and often moving entertainment; what we might have had could have contained every element here, but could also perhaps have been even more intriguing. The theme of the film is "what makes a person human"; and no stronger idea for an idea-level fantasy can perhaps be imagined. But what we have here is a famous and interesting thriller in its own right; I like the envelope involving Richard Deacon, Whitner Bissell and others as the doctors at a mental hospital to which a raving Bennell is taken when he escape Santa Mira's nightmare. The original "They're here!" ending to me would have been unacceptably alarmist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS Aspect ratio: 2.00:1 (Superscope)Sound format: Mono(Black and white)A small Californian town is overrun by alien pods which begin to replicate the inhabitants, prior to spreading their influence across the country - and the world.Alien invaders masquerading as human beings? Or Communist infiltrators masquerading as aliens masquerading as humans? Don Siegel's clever film not only taps into the paranoia of its era, it also exploits the timeless fear of 'invasion from without' which has sustained dozens of similar horror/sci-fi movies over the years. It's also genuinely frightening in places: The 'unfinished' humanoid pod discovered on a pool table in co-star King Donovan's home, which begins to resemble Donovan and eventually... opens its eyes; the bone-chilling close-up of a major character who has succumbed to the alien's influence during the course of a single kiss; and the famous scene in which hero Kevin McCarthy struggles to convince motorists on a busy highway of the impending catastrophe ("You're next! You're next!"). Simple but never simplistic, and photographed in noirish black and white by ace cameraman Ellsworth Fredericks (SEVEN DAYS IN MAY, PICTURE MOMMY DEAD), the movie earns its place as one of the most memorable genre pieces of the 1950's. Future director Sam Peckinpah has a brief cameo (as Charlie, the meter reader); remade by Philip Kaufman in 1978, and by Abel Ferrara (as BODY SNATCHERS) in 1993, with THE INVASION following in 2007.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Horror Movies of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best horror movies of all time, Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a very suspenseful horror movie that succeeds without any obviously scary monsters. Instead, it relies on suspense, action, impending doom, and a completely eery atmosphere to succeed. The slow buildup, in which the entire town is take over by monsters who emanate from giant pods and take over the bodies of the real people, works extremely well in this film. The cast, featuring a terrific but restrained performance by Kevin McCarthy, is excellent. The surprise ending, featuring an ironic twist caused in part by California freeway traffic, is excellent. This is simply one of the best horror movies of all time and works without any obvious monsters, makeup, or special effects. Far superior to any of the sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't sleep. Never go to sleep, because when you close your eyes, they come. They come and snatch your mind away. And, you never wake up. Your memories come to life in another body that looks like you, and acts like you, but it's not you. It's a pod-person from outer space who has reproduced himself as you. This is the terror of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, one of the most dystopian, and original, science fiction stories ever written. The DVD includes a 1985 interview with Kevin McCarthy, who says he never thought the film had any symbolism or allegorical message. "That came later," he says. He quotes author Jack Finney as saying he [Finney] never wrote it that way. I saw this movie in 1956, it is likely the first movie I ever saw in a theater, and never felt then or now that it has any symbolic meaning. It's a scary story that flat out rocks, and I recommend you approach it as such. But, this does beg the question of all those comments about the aliens who don't need love or any emotion, who believe humanity is better off without them. Why are they in the script, and what do they mean? I want to suggest they are what makes the pod-people scary. The notion of assimilation is inherently scary, of course, and one could argue that no embellishment is necessary, but I think the story as a story is weakened without it. There is a continuity error in this story that has bothered me for more than forty years. Spoiler alert, just in case. In the final sequence, Becky falls asleep, just for a moment, and wakes up a pod person, but that's not how the assimilation takes place. They come at night during sleep and snatch human memories that are migrated into a copy of the original body. Miles speculates that the original body simply disintegrates, and the soul perishes. Becky should have died, and another Becky with her memories should have appeared, but that body should never have regained consciousness as a pod person or human. A minor nit, really, that bothers me less now that I understand it is a nit. The original movie does not contain the opening scene at the hospital, or the epilogue, also at the hospital. They were added because the studio felt the original ending was too depressing. Some feel these additions do not work, but I am not one of them. They add considerably, in fact, to the power of this story. Miles' face in the closing scene is a vivid memory I've carried for almost half a century. His reaction is a catharsis for him personally and his audience. It's a powerful vicarious emotional experience, and the movie would be not nearly as good without it. Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter are outstanding here. Wynter is one of the most beautiful women ever to appear onscreen and her first entrance is stunning. Jean Willes and King Donovan are good in supporting roles. This is one of the best pictures of its year, of its decade, and dare I say it, of all time. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Sci-Fi Classics from the 50's of the Cinema History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Miles J. Bennell (Kevin McCarthy) returns from a convention to the small Santa Mira and is welcomed by his nurse and friend Sally Withers (Jean Willes) at the train station. She reports that several patients had come to see him while he was traveling. While driving to his office with Sally, Miles stops the car when a boy runs to the road. Soon he learns that the boy insists that his mother is not her actually. Then he meets in his office his former girlfriend Becky Driscoll (Dana Wynter) that has just divorced and returned from England. Becky tells that her cousin Wilma Lentz (Virginia Christine) insists that her Uncle Ira is not him. Miles invites Becky to have dinner with him and he meets his friend, the psychiatrist Dr. Dan 'Danny' Kauffman (Larry Gates) that tells that the population of Santa Mira is paranoid with mass hysteria imagining doubles of their relatives. Miles and Becky go to a restaurant and Miles receives a phone call from his friend Jack Belicec (King Donovan) asking him to go to his house. Miles and Becky visit Jack and his wife Theodora 'Teddy' Belicec (Carolyn Jones) and they show a partially developed body with Jack's characteristics on the pool table and they go to Miles' house. Then Miles goes to Becky's house and finds a body identical to her in the basement. Miles brings Becky to his house and in the morning, the group finds seeds of pods with doubles of them. Soon they discover that the population is being replaced by emotionless doubles while asleep. They unsuccessfully try to contact the authorities in other cities but they discover that they are under siege by the pod people. Will they have the chance to flee from Santa Mira?"Invasion of the Body Snatchers" is one of the best sci-fi classics from the 50's of the cinema history. The story is tense and very well written and the the screenplay is excellent. The plot is an anti-communism message in period of the McCarthyism, with people with no feelings, with similar behavior, that does not love. The prologue and the epilogue had been imposed by the studio that found the original conclusion with Miles screaming on the highway too pessimist. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "Vampiros de Almas" ("Vampires of Souls")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning and frightening adaptation which emerged as a cinema classic compellingly by Donald Siegel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Splendid Sci-Fi picture which achieved tremendous and unexpected success on its appearance . Science Fiction and fantasy is presented in its most horrifying form . A genuinely frightening , chilling exercise in nightmare dislocation in which hideous creatures from outer space arrive on Earth with plans of conquest by means of pods and being based upon a novel by Jack Finney . There are not monsters only the residents of a town , as their wills , minds and bodies taken over by a weird form of life from outer space . This is the first adaptation , still very scary and creepy about a vintage novel deals with a little town residents who are being replaced by duplicates hatched from weird pods . It creates an altering the human behaviour in the new invaders . Meanwhile , a doctor (top-notch Kevin McCarthy as an angst-ridden medic) must protect his girlfriend (significant role for gorgeous Dana Wynter) and soon aware that pods from outer space are duplicating and menacing everyone there . The doctor may hold the means to avoid the extraterrestrial invasion as he discovers their friends are being taking over by cold human-duplicates , as one by one are turned into aliens . The mysterious epidemic from outer space is spread her friends and known people (Larry Gates , King Donovan , Carolyn Jones , Sam Peckinpah) and small California town people , everybody are being taken over by emotionless , cold behaving beings . The mysterious seeds from outer space are growing and destroying a little town at an alarming attack.This scary Sci-Fi displays a tense screenplay based on Jack Finney novel titled ¨Body snatchers¨ that can be considered truly disturbing . Packs eerie suspense , chills , thrills , spectacular scenes , chilly events and pretty turns and twists . A ceaselessly inventive , ghastly rendition of the alien take-over paradigm , including a a nice built-in paranoia so well tuned for the times that some saw it a parable Communist Witch Hunts. The one and only post-McCarthy paranoid fantasy epic , where a small California town is infiltrated by pods from outer space that replace and replicate human beings . It profits from a winning and intense acting by Kevin McCarthy along with an enjoyable Dana Wynter ; furthermore , a perfect direction by maestro Donald Siegel who proved himself master of the eerie clutch at the base of one's spine . Appropriately exciting and frightening musical score by Carmen Dragon . Very good cinematography and evocatively eerie ambient , including appropriate production design . The motion picture was professionally directed by Donald Siegel . Director Siegel brought an entirely new approach to the Sci-Fi field . He filmed an excellent story and it has emerged as a cinema classic that brings astonishing nightmares . Lovers of the thriller/chiller should no miss this remarkable Sci-Fi , everybody will have fun being scared by this expertly crafted film . Other versions about this known story are the following : 1978 new version , being one of few instances where a remake is an improvement on the original , directed by Philip Kauffman with Donald Sutherland , Brooke Adams and features cameos by Don Siegel and Kevin McCarthy from the original , realized with great originality in spite of being a remake concerning again about mysterious seeds duplicating people . And yet another inferior rendition in which the horror is diminished , being shot by Abel Ferrara(1994) that takes place in a military base in which turns out to be invested with pod people , starred by Forest Whitaker , Meg Tilly, Terry Kinney and Gabriella Anwar , it is regular version as is slow-paced with few jolts of horror . Lately recent version that results to be the least satisfactory titled ¨Invasion¨ with Daniel Craig, Nicole Kidman , Jeffrey Wright and directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel , this so-so take on , it takes advantage of the advances in FX , sound technology and some interesting visual effects . Rating : Better than average . Worthwhile watching .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What A Great Scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the movie there is a sequence in which Dr. Bennell leaves the cave. He steps out while Becky stays behind almost falling asleep. Is Dr. Bennell drawn out by a desire to check how their escape is progressing or to listen to that beautiful music that is coming from the radio. He is probably thinking that anybody playing such a beautiful tune can't be out to get him. This a a great scene. I am eager to know what the name of that tune is.It is a touch choice between this movie and the sequel made with Donald Sutherland but I am inclined to not only say that this is the better of the two but also go so far as to say that it is one of the best horror movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Body Snatchers is a true anomaly in the cinematic world. It has been remade twice, and all three films are essentially adaptations of a novel by Jack Finney. And despite the often terrible nature of remakes, both the 1978 AND 1993 versions are considered to be just as good as this one. I am looking back at these films in light of the 4th Body Snatchers that is coming out this summer with Nicole Kidman (The Hours) and Daniel Craig (Casino Royale).Invasion of the body snatchers is generally considered a political film as well as sci fi. It is a reflection of the McCarthy area (recently shown in Good Night, and Good Luck), and cold-war hysteria.Kevin McCarthy (Death of a Salesman) and Dana Wynter were great and there was good chemistry between them.The film did not need special effects or gore. It built up it's terror with slow suspense, a sense of impending doom, and an atmosphere that was enhanced by the superb musical score.This is definitive sci fi and one of the best movies of the 50's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>---contains "spoilers"----Wow, for classic horror films from the 50's, it doesn't get much better than this. Invasion of the Body Snatchers is downright scary. You start following the characters actions , and start noticing that your town has a problem. Something is happening here. Something strange. Little by little the main character notices that the people have a strange fear, an unknown fear that creeps up on you. Then he discovers that there are giant frothing six foot long seed pods growing in his backyard greenhouse. ( a great scene) He pokes at them and sees that there is a human growing inside each one. His girlfriend is scared to death and screams. It turns out that the alien seed pods grow into humans that take over the city as mindless drones and the real people die off. Slowly the entire city is transformed, except him and his girlfriend. The change happens when you go to sleep, so if you don't go to sleep you are OK, you stay human. The film is frightening, dramatic, suspenseful and mysterious. Man, this is one of my favorite movies. A real classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great 50's Sci-Fi flick, one of the best of the period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Invasion of the Body Snatchers is set in the small Californian town of Santa Mira where local doc Dr. Miles J. Bennell (Kevin McCarthy) returns home after a medical convention. Once back he begins to hear strange stories of people not being themselves &amp; being replaced by cold emotionless imposter's. At first the doc laughs it off as some sort of mass delusion but evidence soon begins to mount that there may be more to the stories than he first thought &amp; after seeing strange large seed pod type 'things' turning into people he know before his very eyes the doc is convinced that these alien seed pods intend to take over the entire Earth as they seek to clone very living person turning them into emotionless shells...Originally having the working title They Came from Another World this Don Siegel directed classic slice of modest low budget black and white 50's Sci-Fi alien invasion flick is a terrific film &amp; is far removed from most stereotypical cheap 50's potboilers with a real tense atmosphere &amp; a pretty creepy &amp; intelligent story. Clocking in at under 80 minutes with the studio tacked on start &amp; ending with the original version running a mere 75 minutes this moves along like a rocket, the story is tight, taught, makes sense, people &amp; character's behave in a fairly believable way &amp; the central plot is both gripping, intriguing &amp; certainly draws you in. The plot relies on generating paranoia just like another classic 50's Sci-Fi film The Thing from Another World (1951) &amp; it's no coincidence that the two are two of the finest genre films of the 50's. There's good tension &amp; it is sustained &amp; increased as the alien plot unfolds, the basic concept of who one can trust is a very primeval instinct &amp; that's maybe why these films are so effective. It's not perfect though, it's never explained what happens to a persons body after they are cloned &amp; the alien version comes to life &amp; the climax at the cave doesn't quite work either with Becky going to sleep but then seemingly reawaken taken over. Why was she not cloned? Why was her mind taken over &amp; not anybody else's? If she was cloned how did the alien version get inside the cave? Watch it, think about it &amp; the story &amp; it just doesn't quite work which is a shame since otherwise it's a terrific film that still manages to be very effective even today in the ultra cynical world of 2008.While most 50's Sci-Fi at the time featured actor's in badly fitting rubber alien suits &amp; car hubcaps hung on string to portray a flying saucer Invasion of the Body Snatchers relies on atmosphere &amp; tension, in fact apart from the large alien seed pods there's no special effects at all. Proved iconic enough to spawn three direct remakes starting with Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) which is my own personal favourite version &amp; moves the action to San Francisco, Body Snatchers (1993) which shifts the action to a US military base &amp; the more recent The Invasion (2007) with Nicole Kidman &amp; Daniel Craig while the highly entertaining teen horror flick The Faculty (1998) has basically the same plot.According to the IMDb this had a budget of about $417,000 which really is no money even back then, crisply shot in black and white (although a computer colourised version has been released) the film has a modest but nice look to it. The acting is pretty good but this is one of those films where the story really carries it.Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a classic piece of 50's Sci-Fi that stands head &amp; shoulders above it's peers from the time, a great film that still remains very effective even when viewed today. Often cited as a classic I find it hard to argue against that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware of the seed pods</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Invasion Of the Body Snatchers has been made several times and this is the best version.A doctor discovers that people are being taken over by aliens in the form of seed pods that grow into duplicates of humans. As people are taken over, he and his lover manage to stay awake for as long as possible to avoid being taken over but his lover eventually succumbs when she falls asleep for a few minutes while hiding in a cave. The doctor then goes to a nearby hospital to tell doctors there but no one believes him until a patient with an unexplained illness is brought in...The cast is led by Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter as his love interest. The movie also stars Larry Gates, King Donovan and 50's sci fi regular Whit Bissell (Creature From the Black Lagoon), who is uncredited. McCarthy had a cameo role in the 1978 remake with Donald Sutherland.This is one of the best sci fi movies of the 1950's and is a must for sci fi fans of that era. A treat.Rating 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Small Town Is Seemingly Being Taken Over By Imposters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is a small town being taken over by imposters? That's what various people begin to believe. When they reveal their fears to Dr. Miles Bennell, he is skeptical at first. Then, over the next few days, he begins to run into old friends and realizes they, too, are acting differently. The questions are, why are they acting differently? And, can Dr. Bennell convince the authorities that something sinister really is going on in Santa Mira, CA? Kevin McCarthy, Dana Wynter, King Donovan and Carolyn Jones are an excellent cast in an excellent little story of "What's going on in my little hometown?" I have the novel based upon the Collier's Magazine serial written by Jack Finney, and I can honestly tell you there really is nothing about anti-communism, anti-(Senator) McCarthyism, etc., in this film. It's just a neat little sci-fi/horror film that works best on a Saturday night with the lights turned down low, during a full-blown thunderstorm. Right now, Jan. 1, 2012, 1:18 AM, I'm watching it during a Midwestern blizzard (I live about 45 miles NE of Indy.) with the house shuddering with the wind gusts. BR-R-R!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS - Don Siegel[FULL REVIEW - SPOILERS AHEAD]I haven't read 'The Body Snatchers', the book by Jack Finney that was the basis of this film, but feel very inclined to do so on account of what I've seen.The plot deals with a small town in the US, where the protagonist, a physician coming home after an outstation trip, begins to notice some strange behavior among the townsfolk - people making appointments with him and then mysteriously canceling them, people temporarily claiming that their relatives aren't actually their relatives. As it turns out there's an alien race propagating via pods, which take the face and form of human beings, even absorbing their memories, though not feelings. Their intention is to completely take over the human race by substitution with the 'pod people'.A lot has been said about the political metaphors that one can draw from this book and film - even without those metaphors I'd say it works fine as a 50's sci-fi paranoia piece. The plot is absolutely first-rate and the mainstay of the film's power. It builds up in a generally credible manner (although there is some unintentional humor in scenes like when a couple that discovers a growing body in their home does little more than inviting the local physician and his fiancée over for a drink to discuss this matter over). The pod people are depicted in a convincing way as beings that have the form and memories of people but not human emotions, which they consider unnecessary baggage.Siegel directs the proceedings in a crisp fashion. There are some very nice visuals, for instance the scene where they discover a host of pods in the greenhouse, all tilted angles and tight close-ups effectively conveying the tension of the scene. Another is when the leads hide in a mine while trying to escape from a mob of the pod people, great use of shadows and perspective shots.The film ends on a somewhat upbeat note with the hero managing to convince the authorities of the dastardly invasion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They are Coming!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is set in Santa Mira, California, a small town that has been invaded by alien seed pods from outer space. These pods have the ability to create copies of human beings, ones that look exactly like the originals, but which are in fact mindless and emotionless shells that become part of an insidious plot to destroy mankind! Dr. Miles Bennell discovers the horrible truth behind the alien invaders and their plot to destroy our world, but his warnings are dismissed as the ravings of a madman.Fast-paced and wonderfully paranoid, this film has been seen as an analogy for everything from the threat of Cold War communism to the mob hysteria, fascism and witch hunt atmosphere of red-baiters such as Joe McCarthy. (Modern analysis also includes parallels to the fear of viral contamination, the loss of self through the programming of religious fundamentalism, and even the brainwashing of people into mindless consumerism by corporate advertising).They're Coming!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of suspicion and alienation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes you an alien? Who can you trust? Does having emotions make you a human? These are some of the big questions raised in the film. Invasion of Body Snatchers was released in 1956, a time when America experienced the McCarthy investigations. Everybody's integrity was questioned. Although the Americans had won the Second World War, the prizes of the victory were slipping away from their hands. A handful of European nations gave in to Socialism and Communism. Keeping in mind the history of this period, this film is an excellent representation of the feeling of fear predominant in the American society in the 1950s. Without any fancy special effects, the film does manage to bring home to the audience the feeling of alienation and horror. A lot of this had to do with the basic idea that prevails the film - your known one has been replaced by another that is exactly like him but still isn't him. The performances given by the actors are far from stellar, quite the opposite in fact, making the film very hilarious at times. The film deserves to be watched for its Twilight Zone-esque approach and riveting theme.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The classic horror that's out of this world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thing From Another World birthed the alien invader film, and the theme proved so popular it quickly became its own genre. Where most of these, especially The War of the Worlds, showed aliens arriving en masse in gigantic spaceships to obliterate humanity from the face of the Earth, TTFAW and its ilk took the same basic idea and ran with it to more invasive places.And Invasion of the Body Snatchers is the finest example. At the time it was made, it was one of the most terrifying alien invader films yet to emerge. There are other worthy examples but few have unsettled audiences like this dark and eerie film.Jack Finney wrote The Body Snatchers up as a serial and then expanded it to a novel. The book is an efficient read but Don Siegel makes a much more interesting story out of it. Indeed The Body Snatchers is such a fertile idea its been adapted into a film no less than four times. And spawned dozens of imitators.Miles Bennell (Kevin McCarthy) is the local GP of Santa Mira. Coming back from an out-of-town conference, his patients come to him with the same story. Friends and loved ones no longer seem like the same people. They look the same. Talk the same. But on the inside, they're different; or more accurately, something is missing. Miles is sceptical, until a friend brings him a featureless replica of himself. Miles realises an alien influence is slowly taking over Santa Mira.Many people have read into Invasion of the Body Snatchers as an unconscious metaphor against McCarthyism and Communism. Siegel and Finney have always denied this, although screenwriter Daniel Mainwaring had Hollywood run-ins with blacklisting, so there may be something to that; besides, what else are you supposed to think when the lead actor's last name is McCarthy?Political overtones aside, I just liked the film for what it is, a chilling horror story. The film gains its effect from the way Don Siegel brings the invaders into the story and just waits for the audience to catch on. In fact he's so successful at this that the film didn't really need Miles providing an ominous voice-over (but more on that later).In the first scenes at Santa Mira, Siegel establishes the apparent normalcy of the town with everybody going about they're business as if it were any other day. But the invasion of Santa Mira has already begun, and Siegel litters the film with clues from the off-set. Like a little boy running into the path of an oncoming car, like he's trying to get away from something. Or a man mowing the same patch of lawn over and over again.None of these things are conclusive, but as the story presses on, these things become harder to ignore. People think there's something weird going on, and then retract they're claims. And when featureless clones of the townspeople start appearing in cellars and basements, the clues all point to something we hadn't even considered; an alien invasion.Siegel structures IOTBS like the film-noir thrillers he made his name in. Harsh silhouettes, long shots of cramped corridors, tight closeups, an edgy piano score. One of the most effective tricks he springs on us is where the film stops in the midst of it, and tries to convince the characters (and I think the audience too) that none of this is real, and we're imagining the invasion of Santa Mira.The duplicates that cropped up in the cellar are now suddenly gone. They didn't leave any fingerprints so there's no proof they were ever there. And when the film brings in a psychiatrist and explains with calm rationalism that we're all part of a shared delusion, its something that almost succeeds in making you rethink yourself.Of course that type of second-guessing doesn't last for very long, but it was great while it lasted. When some unusual sea-pods crop up in Miles' greenhouse, giving birth to a replica of himself, you realise you were right the first time. Siegel saves his scariest scenes for the second half, when Miles and his girlfriend Becky go into hiding.One of the eeriest scenes is one that takes place in broad daylight, when some strangers from out-of-town are passing through, and as soon as they're gone, the townspeople crowd in from all sides in perfect silence. That scene stays with me more than anything else in the movie. Equally creepy is the pod-people trying to reason with Miles and Becky, telling them its so much better this way. And ultimately they don't have a choice in this.Siegel refuses to compromise (except right at the end). Miles and Becky are forced up into the hills and when they separate for a moment, Miles looks into Becky's eyes and sees nothing there. When the reality sinks in that she's been took over, its as scary as it is tragic. But Siegel even manages to top this with that classic scene with Miles getting to the highway screaming about the oncoming invasion, and being dismissed as a lunatic.That would have been a fantastic ending. But unfortunately it wasn't to be. The studio were quite taken aback by what Siegel had created, and forced upon him an ending that promised hope to the audience. Where Miles is relating his story to a therapist, who calls in the FBI to deal with the threat. Its an extremely silly coda that ends the film on a big anticlimax. Actually, Jack Finney didn't get it right either. The book ended on the ridiculous notion of the aliens giving up on they're world domination plot and returning home.In spite of that, Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a timeless classic. Its so-called metaphors are easily dismissed in the face of such an absorbing icon of genre cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Why don't you go in, Miles, we've been waiting for you."Invasion of the Body Snatchers started off as somewhat of a slow burn, but ended up being a sinister and suspenseful thriller. The story has been redone and revised several times in the years since the original novel this movie is based on was written: an unknown alien plant species has landed on earth, and replaces people as they sleep with perfect copies. Perfect, except for their complete loss of what makes them human, their emotions and souls.&nbsp;The main characters are a doctor and his lady friend (played by Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter) who slowly come to understand the nature of the threat, and spend the latter part of the movie trying to stay awake and find some way, any way, out of their seemingly inevitable fate and come up with some means to keep the invasion from spreading from their California town to the world beyond.Body Snatchers is all about paranoia and the fear of a threat that can't be comprehended, and it pulls those themes off pretty well. Besides the somewhat slow start, and a few nagging questions that never get answered (like, what happens to people's original bodies?), and the altered ending (I think if the movie would have ended at the point where it was originally supposed to, it would have had much more of an impact on the viewer), Invasion of the Body Snatchers didn't leave me with a lot to complain about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can overlook if the film is right-wing or left-wing and just view it as an allegory on the dangers of brainwashing and mobilization</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Invasion of the Body Snatchers" is my second favorite sci-fi film of the 50s, next only to "The Incredible Shrinking Man". Even though its never as good on repeat viewings as it is the first time around, this is still a classic. Few other b-movies are as literate, intelligent, and have a political subtext that is still debated up to this day (whether this film supports or attacks the McCarthy witch hunts). I believe that the film itself is anti-McCarthyism (the danger is from within and the government is in on it), but the added prologue and epilogue are anti-Communism (added by the studios to make it more "upbeat"). You can overlook if the film is right-wing or left-wing and just view it as an allegory on the dangers of brainwashing and mobilization.However, unlike some other films, you don't need to think about the political implications to enjoy it. Its still as frightening and suspenseful today as it was when released. Don Siegel manages to create the perfect balance between shocks and false scares. One of the reasons why this film is so scary is that its ordinary folks who are being turned into monsters. Like the hero, the audience is never completely aware of who has been taken over. The acting itself is quite good for a b-movie and Kevin McCarthy makes one of the most sympathetic heroes of science fiction. What makes this film work the most is the pacing. Siegel doesn't add any unnecessary subplots to detract from the suspense and jumps right into the story from frame one. Even the romance plays an integral part of the story. If you haven't seen "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", you're missing out on one of the best and most influential sci-fi films of all time. Its better than either of the (surprisingly decent) remakes.

		<shortDescription>A terrific film as pure Sci-fi or political allegory that is as relevant now as it was in the 50s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a youth I never recognised the allegory regarding the creeping growth of communism within society, although it also has allusions to the smothering of individual liberty by social democracy - as eloquently explained by Friedrich Hayek in his 1940s book "The Road to Serfdom". For me it was simply an entertaining sci-fi yarn of which so many were made, good and bad, in the 50s. As I grew older I later recognised the political dimension but I doubt it had bearing on me later becoming a conservative political activist. The suspense and fear of the chase is well handled and reaches its climax when the hero kisses his girl after she awakens following a rest. That must be the highlight of the film direction. After that the question is how will the ending be resolved and fortunately it is again well balanced, maintaining realism and suspense without becoming cheesy. Made when my Mum and Dad were teenagers and not viewed by me until twenty years later (1976), that it still holds its own and can be viewed by new generations (such as my own teenage sons) some fifty years later when many other such movies have fallen away due to their dated special effects or weak plot lines means this movie should grow in reputation as time marches on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don Siegel's 'Invasion Of The Body Snatchers' is the quintessential alien invasion movie, yet does not feature a single spaceship, ray gun or laser beam. Dr.Miles Bennell ( Kevin McCarthy ) uncovers what appears to be an outbreak of psychosis in the small American town of Santa Mira. A woman claims her Uncle Ira is not the same man, while a little boy becomes hysterical because he believes his mother is not his mother any more. Jack Belicec ( King Donovan ) and his wife Teddy ( Carolyn Jones from 'The Addams Family' television series ) discover what appears to be a dead body on a pool table. It is completely featureless, but over time develops into a duplicate of Jack himself.Miles and his sweetheart, Becky Driscoll ( Dana Wynter ) learn the town has been invaded by creatures from outer space resembling huge seed pods. The pods are able to turn themselves into perfect copies of existing people, only without emotions. The duplication occurs while the subject is asleep. Miles and Becky must stay awake long enough to escape the town and warn the authorities...Based on Jack Finney's novel, this has been filmed many times but the original version remains the best. Fine performances from all concerned, particularly McCarthy and Larry Gates as 'Dr.Daniel Kaufman', the latter becoming a spokesman for the aliens. The world into which he wants Miles and Becky to enter is like our our own, only without humanity. Fearful that his love for Becky will end if he is reborn, Miles refuses outright. Kaufman tells him he does not have a choice...Film historians have over the years branded this film an allegory for anti-Communism, but I find that interpretation too simplistic. Like John Boorman's 'Zardoz', you have as protagonist a character who refuses to go along with the majority and retain his individuality. The original climax was deemed too downbeat for audiences, and so a framing device - in which Miles relates the film's events to Whit Bissell's police psychiatrist - was added. It does not harm the film though.Philip Kaufman's excellent 1978 updating ( starring Donald Sutherland ) had affection and respect for the original. Today's remakes come from people with contempt for all previous versions, and who think that whatever they come up with is bound to be better. In the '70's, the time was right to reinstate the bleak ending. McCarthy made a cameo appearance ( as did Don Siegel ), once more yelling "They're coming! You're next!" as though the intervening twenty years had never happened.Lots of television shows and films owe a great debt to this picture, most notably 'The Invaders' and 'The X-Files'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the best science fiction film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is easily my favorite science fiction film. Gave me the creeps when I was ten years old. Forty five years later, it still gives me the creeps.Don Siegel made some fine movies, but I feel that this is his masterpiece. The movie starts off quick and keeps its pace throughout.There is no embarrassment about the rather bizarre plot. The whole cast plays this movie very seriously and with much conviction.The leads, Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter, are perfect in their roles. McCarthy, no leading man type really, is quite believable as the dedicated doctor.And it's odd to find a b-movie director photograph his leading lady so well. Dana Wynter, a true beauty, looks wonderful in her role. This makes her own 'transformation' all the more hideous near the end. This achieved with no special effects or make-up magic, but one terrifying ice cold stare.I realize that modern audiences probably won't 'get' this movie, as it is too tame, too simple (and too intelligent in its simplicity) to reach our present-day jaded viewers.Much has been made of this movie's 'obvious' analogy to the paranoia of the McCarthy era. I was pleased to read author Jack Finney's thoughts on his story. In short, he says it never occurred to him.I am the proud owner of a first edition of his novel. The book, to the author's credit, is just as compelling as the movie.I also recommend Roeg's 1978 re-make of this film. I rarely like re-makes, especially of films I consider classics. Gone is my beautiful black and white, but in its place is a color movie with a good cast and a clever, cynical screenplay, updating the story for the seventies.Less is more has never been more apparent than in this sci-fi film. Let the youngsters applaud the 'great special affects' and computer technology of today. Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci fi that lives up to its title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The everyday mundanity of 50's small to medium size town life is converted into a nightmare in this extremely well-done film. Usually the titles of sci fi were more interesting than the movies, but here is a film that really takes over the viewer almost as much as the pods take over the town. Instead of frightening the viewer with monsters, it scares the hell out of him or her with the prospect of losing his or her feelings, especially the emotion of love. In spite of the fact that that doesn't really sound scary, it actually is so well done between Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter that it grabs the viewer's imagination through both his or her mind and heart. Add in the idea proposed by the town psychiatrist that once you're one of us you won't want to fight us anymore, the horror sort of seeps under the skin of the sensitive viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of its successors and perhaps the best of its kind... ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've all endured that terrifying feeling of helplessness after seeing or hearing something that nobody else seems to believe. The notion that another human being could dismiss a claim ? especially one regarding something as startling as an alien invasion, as is the case in this film ? one has made as ridiculous or outlandish, without attempting to relate or understand, is sometimes the scariest of all thoughts. Regrettably, this naivety is a trait that has been groomed within the human race for the duration of its existence. For centuries, our race has tolerated war and anxiety, and fear and hatred ? ultimately leaving us in a nervous, worrisome state, unable to hope or trust.In 1955, Jack Finney exploited those thoughts of paranoia in his revolutionary sci-fi novel, 'The Body Snatchers.' A year later, Allied Artists Pictures Corp. released one of the most chilling and unsettling tales of paranoia the world had ever seen on screen, 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers.' Don Siegel's film version of Finney's novel, adapted by former San Francisco Chronicle journalist Daniel Mainwaring, immediately stirred controversy, though it did so to the sound of acclaim and praise. The status of Siegel's thrilling sci-fi horror quickly ascended to cult classic, and rightfully so.His film became the model for others of its kind and has spawned countless spin-offs and parodies, though none of them have surpassed its quality. Hands down, the first rendition of Finney's novel ever to hit screen is, not only the best of its successors, but it's the best of its kind ever made. With looming comparisons to Robert Wise's 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' ? a film released during the start of the Cold War and the first atomic bombs ? and the pioneering, special effects-laden 'Forbidden Planet,' 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' remains the pinnacle of paranoid sci-fi pics and won't soon be conquered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genuine classic of paranoia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This atmospheric, thrilling saga is quite simply one of the best films of the 50s, regardless of genre. It's catchpenny title has probably put a few people off over the years, but half a century after its release it has lost none of its power to grip the viewer.And the central idea, though far-fetched, is an extremely beguiling one. It's simplicity itself. What if you woke up one morning and found that your mother, wife, brother or uncle, were no longer themselves? What if they, despite looking exactly like your former loved one, were someone else?The film opens with Dr. Miles Bennell (an excellent Kevin McCarthy) returning to his small home town of Santa Mira after a medical conference. His nurse reports his surgery has been extremely busy while he was away, full of people claiming their close relatives or loved ones are being impersonated by a stranger.Our good Dr. initially thinks it's a curious form of mass hysteria, but he is soon convinced by a mysterious body that turns up at the home of a writer friend, a body that's the exact duplicate of the author...and then attempts to assimilate his mind and his memories while he is asleep.And from there the film's paranoia is given full force. Who can be trusted? Who has already succumbed? Or as Dr. Bennell says, somewhat playfully to his old flame Becky Driscoll (Dana Wynter) "I'd hate to wake up one morning and find that you weren't you." Discovering that alien seed pods, drifting through space, are invading the Earth by assuming the shapes of its inhabitants,Miles and his fellow believers then face a desperate battle to escape the town and inform the authorities.Sequence after sequence utterly hooks the viewer, Director Don Siegel's efficient no-nonsense style adds to the convincingness of the plot. And the actors, especially McCarthy, are wonderful. I won't spoil things too much, but the moment of the kiss, and McCarthy's reaction to it, is one the most genuinely frightening moments in all cinema.Legend has it the film's narrative framing device was added before release; the producers were worried that the downbeat ending would alienate audiences. But the original plan, to end the film with Dr. Bennell frantically entreating his fellow humans of the danger, and nobody believing him, is a tour-de-force of cinema. The added opening and closing framework is no disgrace to the film, but what an ending that last shot of our beleaguered Doctor staggering down the freeway would have been. It chills my spine every time I see it.There is one obvious plot flaw, but I won't spoil it by revealing it here as it's a central element to the latter part of the picture; it simply doesn't matter in the overall scheme of things. What we have here is a genuine classic. It's not available on DVD in the UK, which is something of a crime. The Phil Kaufman remake is a decent stab at the same story, but it simply can't compete with original.And of course the film can be interpreted in many ways. Anti-McCarthyism? Anti-Communism? Or simply a warning against the danger of hardening our hearts too much? The fact that it isn't clear-cut is part of its genius.Oh, and by the way. How do you know that it's really me writing this....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of many really good sci-fi movies of the 50's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a really good movie. Well done black and white adds a surreal aspect that color cannot quite duplicate without a lot of CG. Think of the fact that, in my opinion, so many of the truly great and lasting sci-fi flicks were made in the 1950's. Movies such as 'The Thing', 'It Came From Outer space', 'Beast From 20,000 Fathoms', 'Them', 'The Day the Earth Stood Still', just to name a few, will remain classics 'till the end of time. 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' is so well done both in it's cinematography and design that it almost seems plausible. Kevin McCarthy as Dr. Miles J. Bennell and Dana Wynter as Becky Driscoll, the two primaries, are excellent and Dana Wynter is just plain gorgeous. It is refreshing to see how if you really know these old flicks you can see many of the same actors in the different films. One of the reputable townsmen in the 'Snatchers' is the same guy that acts as the psychiatrist in 'The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms'. The basic premise is pretty eerie and well executed. The film doesn't exactly explain how the transformation takes place but who among us who dig this type of flick really care. Isn't it interesting how these old sci-fiz can create a scare without a lot of CG and blood and guts. The remake is also a very good film but this one holds a special place in my film library. This is goodie. Enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps one of the best science fiction films ever, "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" still delivers the goods. It also has touches of horror and paranoia thriller.A doctor is called back from a convention, only to find that people in a small town are acting strangely. The doctor, his girlfriend, and others gradually begin to realize that alien pods are growing in the vicinity and are slowly taking over the townspeople.This film was very exciting, and scary at the same time. Personally, the science fiction genre is not a favorite of mine, but this film is definitely an exception. It was also great how well the filmmakers were able to stretch their shoestring budget to bring audiences a knockout of a movie.One of the many movies you should see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paranoia is a common thing that goes around the community. When the community is not what it seems, then you start to panic. Originality is what this movie's got. When people are like emotionless, I called that stoicism. Usually, that would be the way people feel when they know they're not frightened. However this is another story. A shrink(Kevin McCarthy) discovers that most of his patients are like paranoid about their siblings. He thinks its total nonsense, when his colleague realizes that her friend is speaking the truth. Having to learn things the hard way, each individual sees a pod, and a close resemblance of one another, leads to total distrust to everyone in town. All the big trucks, containing pods means trouble is brewing. Ater the colleague became one of the pods, it's the doctor for himself. With all the running and escaping from the pod people, Dr. Bennell didn't stop until someone believes him. Until he realizes he wasn't the only one not affected from the pod people, everyone is safe. This movie is a classic to everyone, the plot, the music, is great and the outline is one of a kind, a must see! Rating 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Review for the best Music Score Around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There isn't much I can add to what every other review wrote about this wonderful film that mixes horror and thrills...and interpretation of the "true" meaning of the film for the film watcher.Brilliant in its story telling, acting (the great chemistry between the actors!!!), camera angles, direction, and execution, this is the best and grand daddy of them all - whether you wish to believe its about aliens - communists - lobbyists in Washington, D.C. - the current political administration, etc., etc. A 'chiller-thriller' that makes you gulp!But what I do wish to comment on is the music and composition of this film work. Many people do not realize how important a music score (orchestration) can truly be...and after watching many old films from "back in the day" - these musicians were honest and serious about making a great film...greater.The score to this film is unbelievable and drives the story, action and chills down your spine. It garners your attention, draws you in. Scares the life outa you. Scores were just as important as the film for this producers and directors and here is a case where it shows.Sadly, many of these great feature film score composers are gone. This one was the late great Carmen Dragon, but his work is right there with Bernard Hermann, Jerry Goldsmith, Franz Waxman, John Williams, etc. But there is nothing like a good score (much different than a music soundtrack for the younger readers) to make a film give you the 'willies'.</fullReview>

They look the same, but they are acting cold and off-key. Soon Miles and his girlfriend Becky (Dana Wynter)discover the reason behind it: the town is slowly being replaced by impostors while they are asleep. Huge seed pods form into replicas of the town-people and the originals are destroyed, leaving cold and emotionless individuals. Soon Miles and Becky are on the run, not being able to trust anyone. And they have to stay awake, knowing what will happen once they close their eyes.This film is still unsettling (Considering that we live in a day and age where "identity theft" is on the rise.)especially the scene in which Miles, Becky and their friends find the developing pods in a greenhouse. There's something about watching your own eventual extinction completely unnerving. The classic scene in which Miles discovers that Becky has changed still gives me the chills. Classic horror film that has to be seen over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good but one BIG plot loophole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kevin McCarthy plays a doctor in a small California town. He comes back from a two week conference to find something is wrong. Lots of people in the town think their mothers, uncles, fathers etc etc are NOT themselves. They look sound and act like them--but they have no human emotions. It turns out their bodies have been taken over by their exact duplicates who grow out of giant pods while they sleep. Soon McCarthy and his girlfriend (Dana Wynter) are trying to escape before they're changed.This is a very good sci-fi movie. The idea of being taken over and loosing all your emotions and being like everybody else is downright frightening. The film is short (80 minutes), makes its points quickly and has some truly chilling moments (I still get creeped out when the body on the pool table opens its eyes). Also it's beautifully directed--the town looks picture perfect pretty in direct contrast to what's happening there. The supporting performances are also well acted--especially Carolyn Jones. Also it CAN be seen as an allegory on Communism, but the director always said it wasn't.Still I don't totally love it. McCarthy and Wynter are not that great. McCarthy accepts everything so blandly I didn't know how to take him. Wynter was certainly beautiful--but not much of an actress. The two leads being so bad does affect the movie. Also there's a HUGE plot hole at the end--when Wynter is changed. How? It's never explained and doesn't fit at all with the facts established earlier. So I am giving it an 8--but that loophole has always bothered me.Here's an amusing little story about the movie. There was an interview a few years back with the film's producer. He said Dana Wynter thought the pods used in the film looked ridiculous--she said they would never scare her. They were out shooting on location and, as a joke, they put one of the pods under her bed in the trailer she was using. She went in and, a few minutes later, came out screaming full blast! When she saw the rest of the cast and crew laughing she caught on. He said she wouldn't talk to anyone for days after that!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thrilling sci-fi horror classic from the golden age of science fiction, the 1950s. It's about a doctor (Kevin McCarthy) who returns home from a trip to slowly discover the people in his small town are being replaced by aliens. Exciting, suspenseful stuff. Once McCarthy starts to figure out what's going on, the pace never lets up. Not enough can be said about how influential this film is. It's been remade several times and a huge influence on science fiction and horror stories for decades. Kevin McCarthy plays the role of his career and is just amazing, particularly in the film's climax. Beautiful Dana Wynter is another big plus. Great direction and a smart, mature script. Some complain about the studio-imposed framing device. While I think it's an unnecessary addition, I don't think it hurts the film much. It's a superb movie that can be enjoyed on many levels. Easily in my top 5 sci-fi films ever.</fullReview>

A Bonafide Classic and no matter what the Intent, the Conventional Wisdom is that it Packs a Wallop with its Psychological implications and its Sociological Parallels with Communism and Conformity are Timeless and Scary.Director Don Siegel knew when He was making the Movie that it had broader Appeal than the average Sci-Fi at the Time and admits that it was Metaphorical and could not be denied its Due as a Thoughtful Allegory. What that is, well, therein lies the Debate.No one can actually Win the Debate because it is up to a predetermined Mindset and can be Argued many ways. Political, Social, and Theocratic are all there like a Rorschach Test waiting to Reveal itself in the Mind of the Beholder. That's what makes this so Enduring, Spawning Multiple Generational Remakes. It's Cultural Influence cannot be denied.The First Screenings were met with so much Horror and Uneasiness for contemporary Audiences that the Producers insisted on an Opening and Closing to Lesson Fears and give 1950's Patrons some Hope and Ease. Even with the Soft Cushion Bookending the Film the Impact remains if not quite as Downbeat as the Original. The Initial DVD release Removed the Aforementioned Open and Close.The Film is a Multi-Layered Masterpiece of Sci-Fi Noir capturing the Zeitgeist of the Era with a Superb Script, Fine Acting, Excellent Musical Score, and Sharp Contrast Cinematography. A Paranoid Picture that is Disturbing Today despite its many Remakes and Imitators.

		<shortDescription>A Classic of 50s Sci-Fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is such a classic that it almost requires no introduction or exposition. Long before I had ever actually seen the movie, I had encountered enough promo stills, clips and review that I felt like I had seen the movie anyways. It feels almost a part of American folklore at this point.We all know the plot by now. A doctor, played by Kevin McCarthy has returned from a trip to find that his town is slowly losing their mind (or are they?). Seems people feel that their neighbors are no longer their neighbors, like they've been replaced by doppelgangers. While on a date with an old flame one night the doctor gets an emergency call from a town couple who have discovered a "body" that isn't quite human. At this point, the doctor realizes that this is not mass hypnosis, but something far more sinister going on.It's essentially a chase movie. Once the action kicks into gear, the majority of the movie is spent with our heroes trying to stay a few steps ahead of the impending menace. The sense of dread is palpable in this movie. As things start to unfold the director does an amazing job of creating a claustrophobic feeling in the town, as things begin to close in on our heroes. We despair along with them that there may be no escape.The greatest thing, I feel, about this movie is the natural fears that it plays upon so well. Many have speculated on the themes of the movie. Is it a commentary of communist fears and the McCarthy era? Is it a commentary on conformity? There are plenty of well-written reviews that can expound on both of those ideas, so I won't bog mine down with them. I will say that the natural fear I was referring to is fear of your neighbors, fear that no place is really safe, fear that the people you know and love aren't quite what they seem. All of these have a role in this movie.Overall, it holds up very well all these years later. The acting is pretty good all around and doesn't feel as dated as some acting technique that you see in older movies. The movie looks gorgeous and crisp. The only real negative I could throw out is the effects, which obviously look dated. I found the pods the characters carry around to look fairly silly, at this point, like overgrown brussels sprouts, but we can't really hold that against a 60-yr old movie.Yes, like most I would say that the 70s version is my favorite, mostly because it feels a little more fresh for today's audience, but the original is still a classic worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Invasion of the Body Snatchers, suggested an "individual's unimportance in a complex, modern world."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1950s, The American cinema produced a sequence of science fiction films that generally revolved around and reflected significant political, cultural and social concerning plots. These films presented incredible events that usually were the result of nuclear radiation, alien invasions, mutation, and body snatching influences. In addition to the film plots, special effects were added to complete the cinematic experience. The film, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, suggested an "individual's unimportance in a complex, modern world." Beneath the unimportance was the political concern of conformity and loss of individuality among the residents of Santa Mira, California. Invasion of the Body Snatchers illustrates the difference between America's collision of Individualism and the collective culture of conformity. Although Invasion of the Body Snatchers did not intend to become an allegory of political work according to director Don Siegel, it is evident that through specific instances, the film became a symbolic contrast of individualism and collectivism. The office scene between protagonist, Miles Bennell played by Kevin McCarthy and former girlfriend Becky Driscoll played by Dana Wynter occurs as they are escaping the pod people, launching the chase sequence. As Miles and Becky hide themselves in a doctor's office, Miles goes into a moralistic speech about the pod people. In this instance, the pod ideology is revealed and ultimate goal of conformity is discovered; to convert the residents of Santa Mira for a collective, classless, Communist-like society as well as to promote the purpose to suppress individuality, to make life easier. In reality, this scene is a symbolic parallel to Senator Joseph McCarthy's pursuit for social conformity in the 1950s. This scene is packed with conspiracy and paranoia. Also, metaphorical of McCarthy's claims that there were Soviet spies and Communists inside the government system and among the general population. While Miles and Becky hide in the doctor's office, they an abundance of take pills to stay awake. Sleep stands as an allegory to suggest the burgeoning of a mass conformity; where the pods take over the residents while they fail to be alert, meaning sleeping. In the film, it is said that, "the pods will absorb your minds, your memories, and you're reborn into an untroubled world". This untroubled world represents the world of classless, ambition-less, emotionless, simple society, where every individual is no longer "individual", rather, a hollow drone of a collective socialist culture. As stated earlier, in the 1950s McCarthy made claims of covert Communists inside the government; Invasion of the Body Snatchers also has a covert concept in regard to ignoring what seems to be out of the ordinary. This concept concerns the role of the authorities in the film. Miles is taken in by authorities on the invasion of the pod people, when the psychiatrists and police attempt to turn the bizarreness of the situation into a simple matter, as if it is Miles who is delirious. This scene alludes to authority figures and the effort to encourage normalcy in the most mind-boggling situations. Invasion demonstrates society becoming less individual and more depersonalized with the characterless collective society replacing America.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) begins with a wonderfully rousing score which sets the pace of the film brilliantly. There is something very theatrical about this and many older productions; they are much like a stage-performance shown on the screen.If you are interested in the theory of the themes explored then there is a lot of good reading available across the internet. It is clear that there are many metaphors which can be drawn from the subject matter.The clipped dialogue is classic film noir. Much is made of the lighting and use of shadows in other reviews I have read. The dialogue does move along at a pace, and ideas and theories of what is occurring in the small town in California are developed seamlessly by the lead characters. The sense of realism with modern films does not apply here, but in many ways I enjoy the film all the more for it, in that it sits so well with the story itself.The chilling tone is maintained from the opening scene until the very last, as the tale of the previous few weeks is recounted by the town Doctor to a psychiatrist as he is held in detention at a neighbouring local hospital. There are some truly frightening moments and the build-up as the Santa Mira residents quickly succumb to the invasion never lets up.The acting and direction are both of a very high quality and complete an extremely fine film all-round.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Siegel Said... &amp; What He Seemed to Have Meant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of the reviewers here pointed to the paranoia of the (Sen. Joseph) McCarthy era, the Cold War, and the House Un-American Activities Committee. That's climbing up the side of the box a bit, at least. But I'd like to get completely =out= of that box. Director Don Siegel said in 1975 that "Invasion..." was -- at least for him -- a metaphor for the human condition: "I felt that this was a very important story. I think that the world is populated by pods and I wanted to show them." So... what did he mean?Could it have been that, regardless of political system or religious belief, the education of young people worldwide is designed to drill control modules into their heads (as in another classic from the era called "Invaders from Mars")? Or that it is constructed turn people into belief-bound automatons ready to follow orders, including those to do whatever is necessary to maintain "order?"The notion that Americans (and Russians, and Chinese, and Koreans, and, and, and) were trained to be good little wage slaves, good little consumers, and good little ("patriotic") defenders of the wealth ... err, "realm," has gained traction several times in popular literature. E. A. Poe, H. G. Wells, Aldous Huxley, Karl Jaspers, C. Wright Mills, Theodor Adorno, Hanna Arendt, S. E. Asch, Martin Buber, Frederich Nietzsche, Charles Cooley, Emile Durkheim, George Hegel, Jean Jacques Rousseau and =many= others had explored it decades before "Invasion..." was even written.Likewise, the suppression of that notion has cropped up again and again. The motion picture industry had lived through a decade of career-wrecking FBI and Congressional investigation by 1956. The target was labeled "communism," but some (including some of the people listed above) argued that it was really support of an ideology that sought to pull the rug out from under behaviorally conditioned consumerism, more or less as Stewart Ewen described it in his mid-1970s book, =Captains of Consciousness=. (Think Marshall McLuhan's =The Media is the Massage= on steroids.) In whatever event, the science fiction genre has often served as metaphoric vehicle for delivery of a Big Idea (or two). Recall "Metropolis," "Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde," "Frankenstein," "The Day the Earth Stood Still," "Forbidden Planet," "2001: A Space Odyssey," "Blade Runner," "Star Wars," "Starship Troopers," and (possibly the most disturbing of them all given the rapid robotizing and de-human-ization of the military) "The Terminator."Along with "The Day...," "Invaders...," and "Forbidden Planet," "Invasion..." =was= a quality film... quite possibly with a quality message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Sci-Fi. Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Jack Finney's novel, this classic film stars Kevin McCarthy as Dr. Miles Bennell, who returns to his small-town practice only to discover a number of his patients who claim that their loved ones are now impostors, since they no longer act like their normal selves. At first Miles thinks this delusion, but he comes to discover, with the help of his old flame Becky Driscoll(Dana Wynter), that alien seed pods have landed, and are systematically replacing people with pod lookalikes, who only appear human. They must defeat this plan, though it will come at a high cost...Extremely well acted and directed film has a smart and intriguing script that is not only suspenseful, but thought-provoking, and has been interpreted equally by both political sides as favoring their agenda! Ambiguity at its finest, though some don't like the tacked on happy ending...Still, the climatic quote "You're Next!" is quite chilling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a classic sci-fi film, my favourite of the entire 'Snatchers' film series. It all begins when a doctor (our main character) Miles Bennell see's a young boy who says his mother isn't his mother, and a woman who says her uncle wasn't her uncle. Despite physical appearances being exactly how they should be, the two of them can tell something is off with their loved one's. Pretty soon, Miles and his love interest Becky discover some sort of plant pods growing in the basement, and then in their friend's back garden. These pods form into people, people that they know, even themselves! That's when they realize that alien lifeforms are trying to take over their bodies. And if they fall asleep, they will be gone forever. Taken over by emotionless beings who look identical to them. Can they get out of Santa Mira in time to get help, or will they succumb and fall asleep?This original 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' is the real deal. It is the best of the entire Invasion series by far! It does not get too in depth with scientific talk like the 1978 entry does, therefore does not drag on as much. This one focuses solely on the chase. We follow Miles and Becky as they run from the pod people all over town. It's exciting and never failed to get my interest. You can see how sleepy the both of them are after stay awake for so long, I guess that's a credit to the acting of Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter who did a great job in this.I highly recommend this 1956 original version of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers'. It gets your imagination going, tells a riveting story and it keeps viewers on the edge of their seats right to the very end.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon returning to his practise in a small California town Dr Miles Bennell (Kevin McCarthy) meets his former love interest Becky Driscoll (Dana Wynter), who approaches him regarding strange occurrences, where people claim that their close ones have been supplanted by someone else, despite the same appearance and memory. Initially suspect Bennell comes around to accept the wild story, when his friends Jack Belicec (King Donovan) and Carolyn Jones (Theodora 'Teddy' Belicec) find a non-complete duplicate body in their house...Heavily influenced by the paranoia of the time - communism angst and McCarthy witch hunts - "The Invasion of the Body Snatchers" manages to live through the period unscathed by gripping at more subliminal fears and issues of identity. Although sometimes heavy-handed with its message, albeit in accordance with filmmaking approach of the era, the underlying questions regarding what makes a true self float around without hitting you over your head with a hammer. Nonetheless the social commentary is much more sparse than in the 1978 remake, while filmmaking improvements in general make the newer version much more intense and terrifying an experience. Still, as a no-holds-barred horror "The Invasion of the Body Snatchers" remains a fascinating thrill-ride with manages to transcend time despite far-reaching changes to movie language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great horror based on a disturbing idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always admired a good horror that doesn't necessarily try to scare the audience with depictions of hideous creatures and monsters, but is able to implement an idea that will be scarier than all of the zombies and vampires combined.That's what Invasion of the Body Snatchers was able to achieve. There aren't any frightening beings roaming around town killing everyone on their way. Even though, this movie is still categorized as a horror. Many people would assume that a classic horror has to show a lot of blood and gore. However, the true greatness of this genre is the ability to frighten and shock through the notions that arise in the imagination of the viewers as they are watching the picture. In the times, when it went out it had also various connections to the idea of Communist undercover agents working inside the United States and the possibility of an invasion by other countries.When Dr. Bennell (Kevin McCarthy) comes back to his hometown he realizes that there is something wrong with its citizens. Namely, many of them are suffering from paranoid delusion, saying that their relatives and friends are some kind of impostors. At first, the skeptic Bennell doesn't want to believe in this ridiculous story, even though he feels deep inside that something might be actually wrong. After discovering a mysterious corpse in one his friends' houses he becomes convinced that the lives of the townspeople are in grave danger. Upon uncovering a mass amount of alien pods from another planet, and later meeting the emotionless army of clones of the people he once knew, he tries to escape far from the city. However, he may find out that this task will be harder than he thought.Invasion of the Body Snatchers that we see nowadays differs in a few ways from the original cut. The Doctor's story is shown in one long flashback, so the intro and the epilogue are added. There is also the use of a voice-over, which makes it a bit easier for the viewers to understand the general conception behind the movie.Now consider what I said previously: the idea of humanity as emotionless/soulless creatures sounds deeply horrifying. Looking at all those people, who have ale the same capabilities, but aren't able to love and hate, gives the creeps right form the start. This is the power of the movie. Fantastic music creates the suspenseful aura in the climax scene that shows the great chase, after a life that can end with a single minute of sleep, and become something completely different.As Dr. Bennell said, we are all in danger, every single one of us. And with a single shot, which shows him looking straight into the camera, the viewer has the disturbing feeling that he is taking to him exclusively. And exclusively, I'm going to say this to you: watch Invasion of the Body Snatchers, as it's one of the best horror movies of the 50's. It's a memorable experience and a true eye-opener.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Sci-Fi Films of the 1950s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the fictional town of Santa Mira, California, Dr. Miles Bennell (Kevin McCarthy), a local doctor, finds a rash of patients accusing their loved ones of being impostors. Another patient is a former sweetheart of his; recent divorcée Becky Driscoll (Dana Wynter), who tells him that her cousin, Wilma, has this same strange fear about Uncle Ira.Don Siegel, later to become known to other audiences when he directs "Dirty Harry", is a great directing force here. He keeps the intensity and suspense high, and fits it into a mere 80 minutes -- long enough to tell the tale, but short enough to keep a fast and steady pace.The film is widely viewed as a covert indictment of McCarthyism (Joe McCarthy, not Kevin McCarthy), with the turning of people into their characterless doubles when they fall asleep representing the dangers faced of America turning a blind eye to McCarthyism. Others, though, have viewed it as a metaphor of alienation in modern mass civilization, or an allegory for the loss of personal autonomy in the Soviet Union, or of bland conformity in postwar Dwight D. Eisenhower-era America. It is sometimes argued to be an indictment of the damage to the human personality caused by reductionist modern ideologies of Right and Left.I think it is interesting to use the film as a parable for those ideas, but if the original writer wrote it as a mere thriller, and the people involved thought of it as a thriller, then it would be wrong to imply any deeper meaning. This is really a flaw of film criticism in general, trying to find more than what is shown. Sometimes pod people are just pod people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A well-liked small town doctor Miles Bennell (Kevin McCarthy) returns from a trip and, to his surprise, encounters a number of patients suffering from a strange delusion: they believe their family members have been replaced by impostors who are physically exactly like their targets but emotionally aloof. With his former girlfriend Becky Driscoll (Dana Wynter), Dr. Bennell soon finds out the sinister truth behind the phenomenon initially assumed to be nothing but mass hysteria, but the menace has advanced further than he expected and it's difficult to find anyone who believes his story.Invasion of the Body Snatchers is considered a classic in the genres of both science fiction and horror, and after seeing the film last night, I see no reason to dispute its reputation. First of all, the film is technically stunning: the very sharply contrasted, shadowy black &amp; white cinematography and the dynamic camera-work alone are a joy to watch, but they also serve the story and the atmosphere perfectly. Especially the final scenes like the chase scene through the desert and Bennell's attempts to stop cars on a highway are highly suspenseful, thanks to the filmmakers' uncompromised understanding of how tension is to be created.The actors fit in their roles magnificently too. Kevin McCarthy portrays Dr. Bennell's growing paranoia naturally, and Dana Wynter as Becky doesn't pale in comparison (not to mention she looks gorgeous). The sense of desperation on McCarthy's face in the epilogue is worth seeing, even if the scene wasn't originally supposed to be there and was added after the studio wanted to soften the pessimistic tone.Over the years, the film has been interpreted in many ways, although the filmmakers have denied intentionally inserting "a message" into the story. In any case, be it an allegory for the fear of McCarthyism, nuclear radiation, conformity or general alienation in the pressures of the modern world, in the end the Invasion of the Body Snatchers is also an effective and good-looking sci-fi thriller. Without a moment of hesitation, I recommend it to any fan of classic suspense cinema and science fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Allegorical horror film offers tutorial on craft.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Santa Mira is a sleepy little farming community like many others around the country. When Dr.Bennell, the town doctor starts to see disturbing changes with some of his patients he investigates. Soon much of the community and colleagues are acting the same way, attempting to stonewall his getting at the truth. Along with his girlfriend he soon finds himself hunted like the Frankenstein monster by the townspeople. Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a prime example of economical film craft achieving maximum effect. No big stars, pyrotechnics death rays or Godzillas, just suspense through subtlety with a firm grip on pace and mechanics. Director Don Siegel does a masterful job of creating a nightmarish thriller in ironic setting by means of tight editing, ominously lit oblique angled compositions and the placid demeanors of the invaders disguised as locals that wash over this average middle America community. With the enemy being us suspense leaps out from the most unlikely of places and it provides for one paranoid exciting chase.As the audience identifying character Dr. Bennell, Kevin McCarthy effectively transforms from mild to wild with each little discovery over the films torrid pace. Dark eyed Dana Wynter as his love interest does her best to remain steadfast and loyal while the rest of the cast remains threateningly dispassionate.Made during the Red Scare era, Body Snatchers' underlying political message about mass conformism is touched upon more than once in the script and could be used conveniently by either side as a metaphor to defame the oppositions ideology. Siegel's message is indeed subversively inventive and novel for the genre but it's his assemblage, rhythm and scare tactics that ultimately makes Invasion of the Body Snatchers a 50s horror classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nightmarish noir/sf hybrid: the first version is still the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Second viewing: I hadn't seen this classic for years, but here was the perfect opportunity, hard on the heels of "The Invasion", the most recent (4th) film version of Jack Finney's story from last year. I liked the new one more than most as I've indicated in my review of that, but it doesn't hold a candle to Siegel's exciting thriller, the ultimate bleeding together of noir and science fiction.I won't go into huge detail about the plot; surely you know it, and if you don't you should see the movie before reading about it, especially in this case! So just some impressions: the 80 minutes of the running time fly by, but are enough to build a real sense of wrongness and unease, both at what is happening on the screen and at the safe, dull, suburban world these characters live in. The blandness of the pod people is JUST noticeable, much more subtle than in later versions; for the first half of the film, we really can't decide if something is actually happening, or if it's all a dream. The casting is excellent; the female characters don't have a lot to do, alas (certainly this is a pre-feminist vision of women in danger!) but Dana Wynter is certainly charming and easy on the eyes, and Kevin McCarthy really is perfect for the role of the competent, rational hero. The score by Carmen Dragon is entirely appropriate, exciting and keyed to the emotional pitch of the film without being too leading on its own.And, as I mentioned above, this is almost as much noir as SF; the long alleys and shadowy, stark black and white photography, the characters on the run throughout, the ambiguous, still somewhat downbeat ending (even the studio addition doesn't ruin things as far as I'm concerned), the late betrayal of the hero by the one he trusted most....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the best fifties sf films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has become very trendy and common in recent years to pass off almost any 1950's sf/horror film as a comment on McCarthyism. One could just as easily suggest a film like "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" alludes to liberal, Big Brother government that is always looking over your shoulder, controlling every aspect of your life. Maybe it's both. Depends on your point of view. But does everything have to have a political aspect? Taken on its own terms, "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" is a wonderfully inventive and very scary movie about 'seed pods' from outer space that have landed in California and are taking over the populace of a small town. When placed in close proximity to someone, the pod 'grows' a replica of that person as he or she sleeps and, while retaining the individual's memories and mannerisms, replaces his or her mind with one from an alien collective. No more emotions, no more faith, just the relentless instinct for survival and expansion. The film stars Kevin McCarthy, who surely was unaware at the time that this would be the movie for which he would be remembered. A modestly budgeted production from a lower-tier studio, "Body Snatchers" is easily one of the half-dozen best sci-fi films of the decade. A sense of paranoia permeates the movie right from the prologue. Who can be trusted? Who is to be believed? Who has changed and who hasn't? That last question is the trickiest. And not only "who has become one of 'them'", but when did it happen? The movie constantly keeps you guessing. Don Siegel's direction is sharp and keeps the story moving without seeming rushed. The dialogue and well-cast performances are very believable, not an easy trick given the subject matter. It's almost as if the movie itself was intended to be a straightforward drama and was taken over by the seed pods as well!</fullReview>

This movie has a strange plot in which alien pods from flowers become human replicas. I have a lot of questions as to how it is possible but the replacements are cold, mindless, unfeeling robots of humans. They become cult-like and frightening towards the humans that they attempt to control and conquer. I am sure that my fears are gone because it's just impossible but the film's cast including Kevin McCarthy, Dana Wynter Carolyn Jones, Larry Gates and others are great and believable in their roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic sci-fi flick about aliens taking over the world one pod at a time still has the power to jolt. Although films about aliens and monsters were quite popular in the 1950s, this was the first to suggest that aliens attack from within, taking over our bodies. This was more frightening than any monster Hollywood special effects could concoct. The plot has some loose ends. For example, it does not explain what happens to the original body after it has been replaced by a clone created from a pod. How is Wynter's body replaced so quickly, as she takes a nap far from home? How did the pod get there? Despite these quibbles, this is a spooky film well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was said in another review:"The film is presented to us as a flashback, with McCarthy explaining the take-over of his town to the extremely skeptical authorities. This is a brilliant device..."Unfortunately, the director, Don Siegel was *forced* to add the opening and closing mental hospital scenes plus the narration, and HATED those scenes and the narration. As Siegel originally intended it, the film should have opened at the train station, with NO narration, allowing the story to unfold for the viewer naturally. The narration basically kills the suspense, since from the outset we're "helpfully" told by Kevin McCarthy that there's something seriously wrong, when it would have been much more suspenseful to let us find out for ourselves.My "9" vote is for the film with the opening and closing scenes removed. With those scenes, it's about a "5".</fullReview>

The acting in this isn't anything great, but neither is it very good in either remake, so that's a tie. The execution overall if this film is far better than the remakes. There are large seed pods that take your body shape and then, while you sleep (even for a second), it takes your mind and then you aren't you anymore! It's a great yarn and the film flows very well. The story builds slowly and very believably, with a great ending. The only "name" actor in the film is Dana Wynter, who specialized in this genre. You will no doubt recognize a few others in the film, but overall, the cast was composed of character actors. You'll love it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) **** (out of 4) Kevin McCarthy plays a small town doctor who starts to see strange behavior in those around him. He soon learns that there's been an alien invasion where people are being replaced by copies of themselves hatched from pods. Next to THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, this here is the greatest science fiction film to come from this era and it's a real shame that this one here doesn't get quite as much attention as it should. I think a large reason for that is this film spawned so many poor imitations that people simply started to overlook what a chilling and unforgettable film this is. I think the majority of the credit has to go to director Don Siegel who does a remarkable job at creating a very chilling atmosphere and the paranoia we see from the McCarthy character is something the viewer feels just from the direction. The film is told in an incredibly fast pace and I really loved the way Siegel gave the viewer information the same time that McCarthy is learning everything. At first we're baffled as to what's going on. Then, slowly, we start to fear what McCarthy does and I think the director made a very wise choice to string the viewer along and let the paranoia of the situation grow more and more dire. I won't spoil the ending for whoever hasn't seen the picture but it's clearly one of the greatest and most memorable of the genre. Even the pod creations are so simple yet they're so effective at the same time. The story too is quite simple and I'm sure dozens of directors would have simply turned this into yet another drive-in flick but Siegel makes it something much more than that. McCarthy's performance is something that is also very much underrated. Again, his last spill is terrific but I really loved the seriousness he brought to the role. The performance makes you feel and believe that this stuff is really happening. The supporting players are all just as good with everyone fitting their roles perfectly. At just 81-minutes the film flies by and there's really not a single frame where you're not caught up in everything going on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic and Very Scary 1950s Science Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1950s science fiction films are a very diverse collection. There are quickie creature-features ("Killers from Space"), Amusing Roger Corman cheapies ("The Wasp Woman", "It Conquered the World"), communist paranoia movies ("Project Moon Base", "Red Planet Mars") above-average films from major studios (the Universal films from Jack Arnold), and a few real classics. Those classics have good casts, intelligent scripts, and higher production values. They include "The Day the Earth Stood Still", "Forbidden Planet", and this film, "Invasion of the Body Snatchers".Doctor Miles Bennell (Kevin McCarthy) returns from a convention to his California hometown of Santa Mira to find that the natives are behaving pretty strangely. Many of them think their loved ones aren't real but are emotionless impostors. At first, Miles believes a local psychiatrist's explanation that everyone is suffering from mass hysteria. Miles and his old flame Becky Driscoll (Dana Wynter) eventually find that real people are being replicated by soulless imitations while they sleep, courtesy of alien seed pods. After a capture, an escape (during which Becky is overtaken by the aliens), and another escape, Miles runs to a busy highway where he is ignored by drivers as he shouts, "They're here already! You're next!" then the film fades to black.The studio insisted that director Don Siegel add a prologue and epilogue with doctors (played by Richard Deacon and Whit Bissell) who uncover the crisis and notify authorities. While some purists hate the added scenes, I think they add a sense of hope to an otherwise very bleak ending. However, it's your choice regarding the added footage, of course.Kevin McCarthy (who is still acting at age 95) and Wynter are superb leads in this scary, scary film. The best performance is probably given by Larry Gates, who excels in his role as a lying, conniving local doctor who has been taken in by the alien pods and does everything to entrap Miles and Peggy. The special effects are necessarily dated, but that's not much to complain about. Be sure to watch, and be prepared to be VERY frightened.</fullReview>

As far as the actual WORK goes, I must admit I am blown away by the atmosphere, the caliber of performance, and the overall execution of the premise herein. Wow! I grew up with the 1978 version, as that was my mother's favorite, too. I had never seen this original until recently. This original work is far more suspenseful than its subsequent remakes. This work bears a much more realistic feeling to it, and while it is terribly dated, it still feels more fresh than the 1978 remake. This review is, however, being written without viewing the most recent Kidman remake entitled The Invasion.All in all? This is pretty atmospheric and tense. Surprisingly good for one so dated as this. Many times, the age of a film can cut into the suspension of belief factor, but this film does not suffer that malady. I was thoroughly immersed, and highly entertained.It rates an 8.3/10 on the B&amp;W Scale from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly terrific little horror film from the Classical era that scares, captivates and throws in some politics for good measure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw 2007 film The Invasion, the sci-fi horror 'blockbuster' if you like, starring Nicole Kidman et al and actually rather liked it as a spooky and unnerving horror about hostiles that were not immediately hostile until they grew in numbers, much unlike other such 'un-dead' or possessed horror caricatures in other films who would attack you as soon as they saw you. The politics felt a little thrown in but complaints of overuse of explosions and stunts and so forth nearer the end I thought were a little harsh. Then I came to seeing this, Don Siegel's Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and I can truly appreciate what an inspiration it is to the genre of horror and I enjoyed it in equal measure.Yes, the film is better than the remake but that isn't saying much. Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a genuinely frightening and genuinely unnerving film that clocks in at about just under an hour and a half but feels ever so grander and more epic than just that. If 2007's The Invasion began in a creepy, ominous but very thrilling manner none-the-less before building to an explosive climax that slightly petered out and would've ruined the film had it gone on for any longer then this film is the opposite in a sense. Invasion of the Body Snatchers begins with the bulk of the film revolving around not a lot at all, just a peaceful and seemingly innocent town in America circa mid 1950s; but what develops is a film experience that become genuinely terrifying as the odds become more in favour of the enemy and less so for the now hapless protagonist.Although the immediate beginning gives the film a completely different slant. The film begins with Kevin McCarthy's Miles J. Bennell, a doctor for a local town, clearly under distress in a police station. Miles is sweating, his hair is ragged and his facial expression tells us something is immediately wrong amongst the calm and quite professional environment he is currently in. What follows is a retelling of events from recent past; a flashback to days gone by; a story to which we will settle down and listen to. It sounds odd but the film has a vibe of noir right there, with its classical Hollywood timeframe and use of black and white as a distressed individual regresses into the past complete with plenty of voiceovers. It sounds odd for a horror film of this magnitude to include an aura of noir but it's certainly the feeling I got very early on.After about fifteen minutes of Miles' story, we come to realise that the character of Miles at least in the past or his version of this tale is actually quite a cool, calm and methodical individual. As a doctor, he is immediately placed within a certain realm of respect and intellect and yet it all began with him panting and in a state of panic ? we wonder how such a man of intellect and a cool, calm persona came to be in this state. The other thing with this is the expectancy of it all. If we realise Miles is in distress despite coming across as how I mentioned, what is it then that drove him to this state? It must be some thing truly shocking to turn him to the state he was in.But Invasion of the Body Snatchers is more than a routine establishment followed by a freak show featuring people from 'outer space'. The film is an exercise in suspense and how to create an atmosphere utilising the tool of the uncanny or of the ambiguous. There are times in the film from the 45 minute mark and onward when you genuinely do not know who's 'in' on it and who isn't creating a fascinating but ultimately chilling predicament for the hero to be in since he does not know who his enemy is. Director Don Siegel has made an excellent film here that looks at fears of the unknown and of the current affair, something he did in 1971 with Dirty Harry, itself a film about a 'fear' that was gripping San Francisco at the time; the Zodiac killer.But for all the politics of Communism invading America and 'taken' characters talking later on about how wonderful it is to feel no emotion which equates to no problems, much the West's view on Communism at the time, the film remains brilliant as an entertainment piece. Sure, we've all read or heard about the Communism metaphors and one character in the film very early on before Miles enters a bar even states that everyone's just paranoid 'due to world events' which I guess is a direct reference to The Cold War raging at the time. But of course the original ending would've had the film begin and end in a different manner; whether or not that would've been better, I don't know. I like the way in which the redone ending pops up and if the original had been used I just get the feeling that would've just been too effective, if that's even possible. You get the feeling Miles goes through Hell in this film, at least give him some cheer at the end of it all. Regardless, Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a thrilling and chilling film that could well continue to captivate and excite in years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore the prologue/epilogue and enjoy classic allegorical sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr Bennell returns to his small town surgery because many of his patients demand to see him. However when he gets in he finds they have all cancelled without reason. However several people tell him that they suspect friends and family members have been replaced by exact copies. He is naturally skeptical but discoveries such half formed bodies and giant pod structures convince him. But is he to late to save the town and can he get away to warn the outside world ? if indeed there is an outside world to warn!Many people will only have see the recent remakes ? both of which have been pretty good. However this is the original and the best by far. The sense of paranoia builds well from the very start and this is the key to the film ? there are no modern visual effects or gore so the tension is n the place of horror or gore. This works better for me and makes it a more involving story rather than another gore-flick. That's not to say the effects aren't good ? for the time they are very workable, not flashy but they add value to the story without becoming the focus.The cast are all good ? especially McCarthy who is excellent as the man who goes form reasoned calm to frantic paranoia in less than 90 minutes! The support cast aren't as memorable but they doing sterling work ? whether as people or clones.The allegory of the bodysnatchers being the threat of communism is obvious ? people look exactly the same but they are eerily different in some way?and it's spreading. It still works now and must have been even more effective back then. But even ignoring that (and you do when you watch) it's still a very enjoyable sci-fi. My only compliant is that the epilogue and prologue detract from the film.They were put in at the request of the studio to make it feel more hopeful than the otherwise chilling (and classic) ending would have been. But really the prologue only serves to tell us what's coming ? and it shows us Bennell's mental state before we've seen anything. The epilogue offers hope but really only serves to dampen what would have been one of the most chilling and memorable endings ever (certainly of the period).Overall this is classic sci-fi that has a tight running time and rarely puts a foot wrong. The studio-backed additions only serve to detract , but happily not very much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memorable Film With Unexpected, Paranoid Underpinnings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to Hollywood lore, the cast and crew of this film decided to play a practical joke on actress Carolyn Jones during the filming: while she was out of her bungalow, they slipped in and left one of the large seedpods made for the film on her bed. They received a more memorable response than they expected, for when Jones returned to her bungalow for a nap and found the pod she ran screaming out into the street.Such is the power of this film. There are no major special effects, and for the most part everything looks the way it should in small town America of the 1950s. But the idea it presents and the paranoia it creates is a remarkable, tangible thing.Loosely based on the novella by Jack Finney and directed by Don Siegel, THE INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS was just a little black and white horror film--but it exploded within America's 1950s subconscious with all the force of an atomic bomb, tapping into fears of everything from Cold War-era communism to a decreasing sense of community to the notorious House Unamerican Activities Committee. And in the process it became one of the most influential horror films ever made, a motion picture that would exert a strong pull on every one from novelist Stephen King to filmmakers like Wolf Rilla.The story has been told in no fewer than three film versions, but while the Donald Sutherland and the Meg Tilley versions are each quite fine in their own ways, the original remains the most powerful. Dr. Bennell (Kevin McCarthy) returns to the small California town of Santa Mira from a medical convention--only to discover that several members of the community have developed a strange form of hysteria: they have become convinced that certain friends and relatives are being impersonated by exact duplicates. Bennell brushes this aside as an oddity, but he soon realizes there is more to this than mere hysteria. The people of his small community are indeed being replaced by duplicates--duplicates being spawned by a strange plant-like alien lifeform.Everything about this film is remarkably fine. The direction is first rate, the script is sharp and intriguing, and the film has a remarkable "everyday" look to it that is gradually subverted by increasing darkness and unexpected camera angles. And the cast is extremely, extremely good. Kevin McCarthy, the beautiful Dana Wynter, King Donovan, and Carolyn Jones all give truly amazing performances in the leads, and the overall ensemble is every bit their equal.The film is presently available in a DVD release that offers the choice of widescreen and pan &amp; scan. Until I purchased this DVD, I had only seen the film in pan &amp; scan--and indeed I was unaware that it had originally been filmed in widescreen. I must say that fine as it is in pan &amp; scan, it is even better in its original ration. Even if you already a VHS version of this film, you may find it worth the cost to replace it with this DVD.

		<shortDescription>One of the best sci-fi horrors ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel like I've seen so many movies with this kind of concept. People aren't themselves, something fishy is going on. Eventually, the evidence is too much to ignore but our main characters are already outnumbered by tens or hundreds. It's similar to the zombie genre except that here the "possessed" or "infected" ones act normal which is far more unnerving. This has to be one of the earliest and most effective versions of this kind of story.It is legitimately creepy and has many memorable moments. Blank, "dead" bodies turning up out of nowhere. Alien pods giving birth to proto-humans. A convergence of strangers in the middle of town as if they all have telepathic powers. You begin to suspect people constantly, are they really on our side? Are our heroes being lured into a trap? Are they safe here? The build-up is excellent as well. People urgently seeking a doctor and then abruptly canceling and feeling much better. A boy terrified of his mother because she is not really his mother and then suddenly he is okay again. A woman swears that her uncle is no longer himself but can't quite prove it. Your imagination starts to fill in the gaps.It's effective to show the main character flustered and babbling at the start. It contrasts greatly with how calm and reasonable he was only a few days ago as he recounts what happened. We figure that it must have taken something very disturbing to drive him to that level of mania. This builds our anticipation for finding out what he went through.It's funny that the main actor's name is (Kevin) McCarthy. There are certainly parallels that could be drawn with the communism scare of the 1950s. Are we too suspicious about our neighbours? Are we becoming paranoid and seeing everyone as being against us? Or perhaps our freedom is being taken away and we are being forced to robotically follow traditional American values.Invasion of the Body Snatchers wastes no time at 80min. It builds the way a good suspense/horror film should and the turn of events are satisfying. It isn't too predictable and it really had me on the edge of my seat, apprehensive about where the story was going and how it could possibly be resolved. Less is more and this movie only shows what it really needs to. It plants the seeds of fear in your mind and you do the rest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dr Miles Bennell (Kevin McCarthy) insists he's not insane as he recounts his story. He returned to his small town Santa Mira after many people started suffering similar symptoms. His former love Becky Driscoll has a cousin who thinks her uncle is an impostor. He is skeptical and assumes the many cases to be mass hysteria. Then his friend Jack Belicec shows him a body that looks like him. Later he finds a body that looks like Becky in her basement. He reports it to the police but the bodies are gone.As far as classic 50s sci-fi, it doesn't get much better than this. It is still watchable in the modern sense. It has the paranoia and Kevin McCarthy is brilliant. It is no wonder why it has been remade multiple times. The concept is simple but effective. And the scene where he warns the audience directly through the screen is a movie icon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good classic sci-fi film. Not really a plausible film but a good work of fiction. Interesting story, great group of actors and just enough horror to add to alien science fiction theme to make it a cult classic.An alien life form has landed on Earth. It's intentions is to duplicate itself into every life form on the planet - including humans - in order to survive.I read about the original ending to this film - that sounds like it would have been good to me - it was a grim ending with Dr. Bennell screaming as he saw more pods in a truck (no hope for the Earth). But the version I have seen is the "happier ending".... which still worked for me. In this "happier ending" it gave us a feeling that maybe Earth could be saved and left an opening for a part 2 if they had chose to do so. I would not mind seeing the original idea - but his "happier ending" was good to me.This makes a great after dark film for those that like sci-fi.8.5/10</fullReview>

The scares still work, the score is all manner of creepy and its paranoia is credible. The themes of robbed identity and dehumanization help it maintain resonance; it's a universal fear. I always liked Siegel's look for this movie, the noir visuals, askew angles, and I get plenty of mileage out of the phrase "pod people" in everyday life. This movie's place in sci-fi and pop culture is assured. But at the end of the day, it's just good entertainment, and hauntingly pessimistic.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few movies can boast as many remakes as INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS- and it's still arguably the best (despite my own blasphemous remarks regarding the first of the many pod productions- uh, remakes...). Certainly no one has teetered so close to the edge of paranoid hysteria as Kevin McCarthy in the original (although, to be fair, Donald Sutherland DOES come close in the second version). And who could compare to Dana Wynter as the breathtakingly beautiful Becky...? The greatest irony of it all, in Real World terms, is that it didn't take an invasion of any kind from outer space to get the job done: in the end, we lined up and filed into the superstores to get our greedy little hands on the electronic surveillance devices with which our Earthly Lords and Masters keep track of our every move and thought and we enlisted voluntarily in their stormtrooper legions as they scoured the world in their bloodthirsty quest for Money and Power.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the classics of the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been debated for decades whether the film was intended as an anti-Communist allegory or an anti-McCarthyism one. While there is evidence to support either theory, I personally feel that it works as an indictment of totalitarianism in both the extreme right and the extreme left. It can also be seen as an indictment of social conformity. In any event, the film is a wonderfully written and acted sci-fi thriller with a pervasive sense of paranoia and alienation. It finds its horror in the familiar being subverted rather than with alien spaceships destroying cities or giant monsters rampaging through them and it is all the better for it. Along with "The Day the Earth Stood Still" and "Forbidden Planet", it is one of the three best sci-fi films of the 1950s. While it predates both series by several years, it could fit into either "The Twilight Zone" or "The Outer Limits" very well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read a Simpsons-comic once that was about sea pods taking over people's bodies and turn them into soulless robots. I thought it was very interesting and funny, and when I also found out much later that this was a parody of a movie, I HAD to see it. Though when I read about it, I got a little worried about everyone complaining over the changes that have been made for the movie, with not only the beginning and end, but also adding a bit of a narration to the movie! Still, I really wanted to see it, so I took a chance. Well... the plot was well-constructed, the actors were great (especially the one playing the doctor) and the whole movie itself was really exciting. The only problem I had with it is that it added unnecessary narration that told us about recent events. I didn't know it would be spread out over the whole movie! So I feel a little glum to give this a 8/10 instead of 9. The movie was after all almost perfect. Still, I really recommend it to your guys out there, it's really great after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's nothing I can add that hasn't already been said ten times in a hundred different ways. This is for those who want a quick opinion. Here's all you need to know-Good film -Watch it -All attempts to remake aren't nearly as good or exciting so don't bother.I suggest a darkened room and few distractions. Watch this film on a rainy day with a loved one in your arms (i.e.. the distraction).My partner is what I call an anti-sci-fi fan. He hates the genre (Im certain it's just to annoy me). He loved this film. He wanted to see it again. It a 1956 production so it has 1956 sensibilities. Adjust expectations accordingly.----SPOILER ALERT -----If this film has a flaw, this is it. It's not a deal breaker by any means but it's one of those things that bugs me. The scene where Becky is in the cave, unable to stay awake, and Miles kisses her. She seems to instantly become a pod person which is vastly different than the rest of the film. I have always wanted to know what the director or writers intended. Was there a pod in the cave and pod-Becky is pretending until she is exposed? I'm surprised that this is never mentioned in the goofs section so there must be a justification I've missed that everyone else knows. Must be a pod thing that only pod people know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Can't you see everyone, they're here already. You're next!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's taken me way too long to get around to this film but I'm glad to have made the effort. The picture serves as a direct counterpoint to 1951's "The Day the Earth Stood Still" in which humanity had a decision to make and it wouldn't have been too late to set the world on a more peaceful course. Here, the humans don't have a chance, eventually everyone would fall victim to the body snatchers emanating from their birthing pods.In the Kevin McCarthy interview that accompanies the Artisan DVD release, he seems to dismiss the idea that the movie was a commentary on Communist paranoia or making some related political statement. Funny, but that's exactly the idea that came to my mind while watching the film, ie, how easy it is for a society to become brainlessly influenced when critical thinking goes out the window. Replacing thought and emotions with a doctrinaire acceptance of a universal mindset has always been the statist's goal, and never has that been as prevalent as it is today, with the complicit manipulation of government, science, academia and entertainment.In terms of pure science fiction however, this is simply great. The story admittedly builds somewhat slowly, however I found that to be a perfect way to build anxiety and tension into the unveiling of the horror that threatened the town of Santa Mira. When Teddy Belicec (Carolyn Jones) screams "It's alive, it's alive" at the first sign of her husband's double beginning to animate, I couldn't help but recall Colin Clive's same reaction to the monster he created in 1931's original "Frankenstein". I wonder if that was a deliberate nod to the famous horror classic.Something I wasn't aware of considering the film's notoriety was that Sam Peckinpah had a brief appearance in the story as Charlie the gas man who startled Miles Bennell (McCarthy) and Becky Driscoll (Dana Wynter) in the basement of the Driscoll home. The interview mentioned earlier also noted that Peckinpah was on the set as dialog coach as well as having something to do with some of the scripting, but reading some other information on this site makes that debatable. Nevertheless, Peckinpah's appearance is a neat bit of trivia.Overall, if you're a sci-fi fan who loves great cinema, this one is a must. The film combines a nice blend of horror and tension to keep you in suspense, not to mention a creepiness factor with the pods that disgorge their eventual human wanna-bes. And if you keep your eyes open and stay attentive, you'll be amazed to see the most unbelievable sight of all when Miles and Becky pull into the gas station - gas at 23.9 per gallon!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Invasion of the Body Snathchers" is really a title that you would think deserves to belong to a throwaway B-movie of no mark. However, this film bucks that trend. Quite a creepy film that follows mainly a lead man in a town where he and the other happy residents are being surreptitiously replaced by clones. The questions are varied, and we follow our leads as they try to decipher what is going on and then how to react to it.Not often something you say for a film in this genre, but the acting is generally very good and our lead (Kevin McCarthy) really carries off his role with aplomb. He makes it almost believable and convincing! Direction is good and there is always an underlying creepy tone to the film despite there being no gore or the likes. Everything is in our heads! I'd say you should give it try. It's more cerebral, but always accessible. Enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

You're next! You're next!"The film was made during the McCarthy era, and it has been thought it reflects on what was happening in America back then.It's not necessarily true, according to actor Kevin McCarthy and writer Jack Finney.Whatever the truth may be, the movie still captures perfectly the feeling of paranoia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't read the source material, but I would gladly do so. From what I understand, this is a really faithful adaptation. I have watched every version of this story I've been able to; this, the 2007 one, and The Puppet Masters(OK, technically different... my point is, I *love* this concept). And this is by far the most well-done. It holds up remarkably well. Sure, there are signs from the times; children aren't listened to, women are "hysterical" and not as useful as the men... however, it's really quite tolerable here, and the vast majority of what we see here "works" to this day. The plot is smart and will keep your attention throughout. Characters are well-developed and credible. The romance is good. Dialog and script are compellingly written, and they move fast, supplying a lot of information. This is genuinely suspenseful, tense and immensely engaging. The story is great and well-told. Every acting performance is strong, other than maybe the kid, and he doesn't take away from it all that much. The "emotionlessness" is quite convincing. This is extremely creepy; I would say it's mainly on account of it being so close to the natural and regular. It is devastating when it is just barely "off" like that, I would say. Think of Silent Hill. The FX are *amazing*; seriously, there are few exceptions to this, and at best, they will shock you. Designs are interesting, as is the idea behind this(if they do mess up its continuity once or twice). The ending could be better, but that's the studio's fault(read the Trivia section), and you can simply pretend it ends a little sooner. This was colorized in '88, and they got away with that nicely. The editing and cinematography are skillful; less cuts than we're used to today, yes; however, it is high quality. This is the original, and it takes the rest to school. I recommend this to every fan of the genres. In fact, I implore you; look beyond the silly title, and discover a classic and a true gem of psychological science fiction horror. 8/10</fullReview>

Superior science fiction chiller and insightful parable for 1950s paranoia/McCarthyism (both Joe and star Kevin; get it??) : space spores are taking over the sleepy hamlet of Santa Mira, California and only McCarthy can stop it...or can he? Genuinely captures the sense of mistrusting your fellow human beings and includes one of the all time great lines, "They're Here!! They're Coming For YOU!! YOU'RE NEXT!!!" Directed by Don Siegel , who would later direct "Dirty Harry." -- Trivia bonus: filmmaker Sam Peckinpah has an unbilled cameo and contributed to the script (!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK. I'll admit it. I am a sci-fi fanatic. And I especially enjoy the sci-fi movies from the 50's and early 60's. Along with The Thing, Day the Earth Stood Still, War of the Worlds, Creature from the Black Lagoon, Them!, Forbidden Planet, The Incredible Shrinking Man, Village of the Damned, and a few others, this film helped to raise the standards for movie science fiction.Besides an excellent story, Ellsworth Fredericks' camera work is practically a course in cinematography. You don't really notice it--you're not supposed to--but Fredericks' attention to the rules of continuity and photographic composition are in part why this movie flows so well. Also, the many night scenes were shot at night, during an era where a lot of night movie scenes were just underexposed day shots, adding a realism to the mystery and scariness of the movie.The other pluses: Great direction building from an almost Mayberry-like feel at the beginning (after the prologue) to more and more tension as the story develops the mystery. The screenplay is extraordinary in that is sounds like it was written for adults, rather than the 12-year old typical sci-fi fare of the time, although only a hint of the suggestive adult dialog remains from the original screenplay. In one scene, Becky asks Miles, "Is this an example of your bedside manner?" "No, that comes later."Style. Arguably, this is a crossover film between Film Noir and Science Fiction/Horror. The hero is well meaning but powerless to control his circumstances. And look at the posters behind the pool table in the Belicec's house.Casting. Almost perfect. Kevin McCarthy plays every scene like he doesn't know what is coming next. The others are excellent as well. Only change I might have made...Donna Reed was considered for the part of Becky Driscoll. I think she might have done it better. For sure, she'd have not had a British accent.More. I first saw this as a kid living in a small city not unlike the fictional Santa Mira. Watching this from time to time, it is also a kind of movie time capsule portraying the 50's just as I remember the time. I know I've watched this movie 25 times, and every time I see something else about the cinematography and the setting.Finally, I've read and heard for years of the original version without the prologue, epilogue, and narration. When the DVD was released, I rushed to buy it. Maybe both versions? No chance. Just Widescreen or Pan-and-Scan. Oh well. One day, maybe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Summary: best movie version, but read the book!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read this story as a three-part serial in Collier's Magazine in 1954 (I think). I was about ten years old. Frightened me more than anything else I've ever read. It was later expanded into a novel and then made into the 1956 movie. By the way, the original title was simply "The Body Snatchers".I didn't like the movie that much when I first saw it in '56, because it didn't conform to the book. And the ending was quite different: Miles' girlfriend Becky did NOT get taken over by a pod!So many reviews of this film give Don Siegel credit for this dialog and that scene and that event. Much of that credit should have gone to Jack Finney. There are movie quotes lauded by reviewers that are straight out of the book.One of the last sequences in the book takes place in Miles' office where he and Becky have been locked in by converted former friends. They manage to "fool" the pods placed outside the locked door into taking over two skeletons that Miles keeps in his office by putting real blood and hair on them. The description of what they see when the skeletons are "replaced" is extremely well done.The single most memorable scene in the book: when they go back to see the body on the pool table and it's gone; only a few pieces of lint remaining. That was the final scene of Part 1 (I think*) of the serial.* Hey, that was 50 years ago!The novel is available. Although I just now looked it up on Amazon and read a few of their preview pages and I see that it's been updated. For instance, the first page refers to the date as October 28, 1976. In my own copy, the date is "August 13, 1953". Don't know what other changes may have been made, but setting it 20+ years later could have an effect. All I can say is the original is great. Read it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For nearly every genre of film there is that one undeniable, be all-end all, black and white masterpiece. Horror has Night of the Living Dead. For suspense, it's Psycho. And for drama/romance, Casablanca steals the show. These films are classics, timeless pieces of celluloid waiting for the next generation of movie-goers to fall in love with them. For science fiction, this masterpiece is a little movie by the name of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. There's not much I can add that hasn't already been overstated. Don Siegel's 1956 classic still packs a punch today. Most everyone knows the story: Aliens are invading Earth and replacing the citizens of a small town with emotionless copies. Some see the pod people as an allegory for Communists, but Siegel claims to have just made an alien invasion thriller. Whatever the case may be, the story remains timeless. The proof is in the remakes (which are recommended viewing themselves in my book). Kevin McCarthy is a delight here as is much of the cast. I highly recommend that everyone see this important, genre-defining movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gave me a good scare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has often been said that good horror films work on the viewer's imagination, rather than drowning him or her in endless oceans of blood and gore. No movie better illustrates this principle, I feel, than the original "Invasion of the Body Snatchers". I remember seeing this movie one night almost a decade ago and, despite being eighteen at the time, I felt like a scared little boy when it came time for me to go to bed a little later on. (Before turning out the lights, I must have made at least half-a-dozen checks under my bed and everywhere else in my bedroom where it would be hypothetically possible to hide an alien seed pod.) I just couldn't help it; "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" is an incredibly unnerving film. Although the only remotely alien-looking things that appear in it are the seed pods, there is something unbelievably chilling about seeing once-normal human beings suddenly transformed into emotionless clones, and the fact that the victims of the pods are all "snatched" in their sleep certainly doesn't make it any easier to go to bed after watching this movie. Particularly creepy moments in the film, I felt, were that scene where the incomplete clone adopted the same injury that the "original" had acquired after cutting his hand, and that scene where the hero and his female companion looked in that house and saw one of the people in it about to stick a pod under the baby's bed.If you want to be a real prick, find someone who is easily scared and make them watch this movie (preferably at night). Then, while they are doing this, get half-a-dozen or so papier-mache pods (that you had the foresight to make earlier, of course), and stick them under the victim's bed, in their closet, and anywhere else that you can think of. The results should prove most interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don Siegel made what has to be considered the best Sci-Fi/ Horror film of the 50's. I saw this film in 1956 in the theater. To get to and from the Movie I had to go by a nursery. Up on the hill there were the hot houses. I just knew that the PODS were being grown in there. I was frightened to death everytime I went by there. This stayed with me for years. The actors: Kevin Mccarthy, Dana Winter, Carolyn Jones and King Donavon played their roles with such conviction that it was all real to me. Even to this day watching it on Laser disc or when it is on Cable it sends shivers down my spine. The political statement that was made is as meaningful today as it was in the 50's. I think that Don Siegel was a wonderful director. By the way we know he was in the film as well. A bit of Hitch</fullReview>

The last scripted words of the townsfolk suggest a far more chilling end than the studio forced hospital scene.But isn't it curious that the star's surname is McCarthy?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps even more applicable today than 50's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie explains that not through a vast takeover of foreign enemies, but a calm complacency of the nations own people could destroy the nation. This could not be more true today in many concerns over sovereignty and other human rights causes. The movie is probably the best ever made over the struggle to remain human against all odds. Not a sci-fi special effects extravaganza but very hard hitting and to the point. While the mantra, "Don't fall asleep" is repeated and taken literally in the movie, it is in a broader sense telling the audience "Don't fall asleep into complacency and keep your eyes open." In effect it was a fifties version of "The truth is out there!" It would be very interesting to see a movie made today that could as effectively convey the overtones as this movie did. All the remakes and spinoffs focused more on the Science-fiction aspect of the film, but this one remains the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film disposes of the naivete and pretense that hinder other sci-fi films of the 1950's. It's dripping with suspense, fear and paranoia and I am especially impressed with the musical score that's as subdued as a root canal without anesthesia. It's also loaded with sexual innuendo, a rarity for that time. The original ending had the doctor wandering aimlessly on the highway, frantically trying to summon help from anyone who would listen. Unfortunately, the studio bosses forced Don Siegel to add some new scenes. These are at the beginning and end of the movie that show Kevin McCarthy in the hospital ER with Richard Deacon and Whit Bissell. I have over 40 sci-fi films of the 1950's in my collection and this one is the best of the bunch, BAR NONE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I saw this 1956 classic, I saw the 1978 remake starring Donald Sutherland, and I found THAT pretty scary (then again, I saw it years ago, when I was a lot younger). Going back to this version, however, I found myself turning on lights around the house, looking for pods, etc.By now, you should know the basic plot. Aliens apparently have landed in Everytown, USA, and are hatching pods in the basements of normal, everyday Earthlings that are basically clones of the house's inhabitants. As soon as the person falls asleep, BANG! Their clone takes over.Kevin McCarthy plays a perfect Everyman in this, and Don Siegel does a wonderful job pacing the film. There isn't much time to dwell on how someone's uncle's been taken over by aliens, because LOOK OUT! They're coming right for you next! McCarthy's character gets to explain everything to the police in a flashback, and even as he speaks - and you don't yet know what's going on - you feel a shiver or two or three creep up your spine. He looks like a normal person, and yet he's raving about aliens...It's a classic, folks. Watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A charming sci-fi classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though it falls under the categorical listing of "B" movies, Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a must see for any science fiction connoisseur. Played out and set in a time when the best of the best science fiction classics came to the golden screen, this film is a wholesome scare flick for the viewer of any age. It lacks the gore and unneccessary vulgar dialogue of the more contemporary sci-fi flicks like Species or Alien, which only adds to the charm of this late 50's drama. As with any movie of its time, Invasion of the Body Snatchers lacks the horror associated with science fiction. The idea that this movie presents is chilling it its own design, even for the modern viewer that is accustomed to horrific butchery and far-fetched craziness. I was literally frightened by the idea of humans being taken over by aliens. Not just possessed, but having their bodies replicated in "pods" in order to take on their physical features and gestures and assume a person's identity. Aside from the fright filled adventure of who's an alien and who's not, there is the enchanting romance of Miles Bennel and Becky Driscoll. These two, main characters of the screenplay, find themselves rekindling a romance from years before. Miles and Becky are both fresh out of failed marriages and as fate would have it, they coincidentally return to their hometown in Southern California at the same time. I couldn't help but be further drawn into the movie by this innocent romance between two very adult people. This sort of love story with its almost childlike candor simply wouldn't be found on the screen today. Invasion of the Body Snatchers covers every aspect necessary for a tantilizing film. The suspense of alien invasion infiltrating the melodious lives of all-American townspeople, and the bittersweet tale of romance in a world of chaos are the ingredients that make Invasion of the Body Snatchers such a timesless favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a teenager, and I finally found a black and white classic that I love. Seed pods fall from outer space landing in the farm feilds of Santa Mira, California. From these pods grow replicas of the humans in the town. When the actual humans fall asleep the replicas grown from the pods take over the human bodies. These bodies have no feelings or emotions. The two main characters in the movie, Miles Bennel and Becky Driscoll, were exceptionally portrayed in the film. The two fit together perfectly and lit up the screen with suspense. Miles Bennel, played by Kevin McCarthy, and Becky Driscoll, played by Dana Wynter, make the perfect romantic couple. The movie flowed very smoothly. There were never any slow parts that lost my attention. The movie was full of suspense. Just when I thought Miles and Becky had escaped there was a turn that brought the suspense to a new climax. All in all I thought this was a great film. I don't think seed pods will fall from outer space to take over the human race in my lifetime. I don't even know if anything will come to take over the human race, but I do think it is possible that someday we will find something on Earth from outer space. I loved the movie, and I think everyone should give it a try even if you are not a big fan of science fiction. This is definitely one of my favorite science fiction movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best adaptation of the source novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first of many adaptations of Jack Finney's novel 'The Body Snatchers', - which was originally serialised in Colliers Magazine in 1954, - Don Siegel's film set the science fiction template for cinema narratives about control, and the subversion of individualism. Whilst it has been reported by Finney, Siegel, and others involved in the production, that no political or metaphorical message was intended (they all simply thought that they were making a thriller), the simple story of aliens quietly invading our world and replacing us with emotionless replicas, was an irresistible package that was open to many contemporary interpretations.The America of the 1950's was one of social convention and conformity, and the desire to present an habitually formal appearance. The outsider who sees behind this veneer is a dangerous person, transgressing from normal linear passages. The teenagers of America (as seen in James Dean's Jim Stark in Rebel Without a Cause (1955)) were a dangerous new opponent to the hypocritical values of the countries proverbial "dream". Therefore, the pervading consensus in political and social attitudes was to distinguish individualism, and to suppress those random and spontaneous desires.In Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Kevin McCarthy's Dr. Bennell's hysteria is revealed at the start of the film, his recollection of the past days events, told not only to clear his own anxiety-riddled memory, but to also defend his sanity, to confess his erratic behaviour as non- conformist, and to logically explain the reason he "stood out from the crowd". In the next scene the doctor is calm, respectable looking, merging into small town life. He begins to hear reports about people behaving unusually. Close family friends becoming devoid of emotion over night. In a later scene, Bennell and Becky Driscoll (Dana Wynter), an old friend of the doctors, watch a haunting image from a window. A congregation gathers in the town centre, as pods (the alien, plant-like objects that duplicate the humans) are distributed for the indoctrination of their children and loved ones. A violent response to the rise of adolescence rebellion, from the formative generation, but also a more sinister political philosophy.When the pod people begin enveloping the inhabitants of Santa Mira, their ideological conspiracy is an easy metaphor for the political machinations of McCartyism, the propagandist attack on communism, and the perceived danger to American values; or a reflection on the rise of Hitler and Nazism in Germany in the 1930's. In these context's, it is the loss of personal freedoms and individual rights, brought on by political conformity, that transforms the population into zombies. Without these fundamental human emotions and freedoms, we are simply mechanisms to order. Nothing unique comes from that. As Dr. Bennell discovers the ramifications of conformity, he disputes the outcome; he doesn't want to lose love, anger, frustration, or grief. These emotional reactions to the various obstacles of life or essential to our originality.Invasion of the Body Snatchers wasn't at all unique in its themes. Many of the decades science fiction films were expressing similar fears of invasion (The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), War of the Worlds (1953)), but Siegel's was a far more subtler production, than some of the more lavish special effects driven movies. Partly, no doubt, to the minuscule budget. But the film is still effective today, the pace building tension throughout, and revealing increasingly horrific and terrifying images. Over fifty years later, it is consistently the best adaptation of the source novel, and the alarming themes of global control and political corruption, are still relevant (possibly more insipidly) in the twenty-first century.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Sci-Fi/Horror Film that's Much More than Meets the Eye.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film, a raving, seemingly crazy man (Kevin McCarthy), retells a fantastical story to a psychiatrist after his arrest. His name is Miles Bennell, a doctor in the small town of Santa Mira, California. People of the town begin suffering from what, on the surface, appears to be mass hysteria; they, in increasing numbers, believe that their relatives and friends are really impostors, despite looking exactly the same and retaining their memories in perfect detail. It's soon discovered that perfect clones of the townspeople are hatching from giant alien seed pods, absorbing the memories of the original person and disposing of their body while they sleep. It's up to Dr. Bennell and his old fling, Becky Driscoll (Dana Wynter), to escape from the now-occupied Santa Mira and alert the authorities.The film may at first seem fairly simple. The plot isn't terribly complex, the acting not terribly impressive and the writing somewhat-shoddy (it's established that the clones in the pods absorb the memories of their originals and awake to take over their life while the original sleeps, although Becky herself changes into part of the alien hive-mind after a mere moment of sleep, no pod-birthed clone involved). The depiction of women as weak and meddlesome is somewhat annoying to even my extremely non-feminist sensibilities.It is, however, a much better film than first meets the eye. The scenes showing the clones developing in the alien pods are genuinely unnerving. The climax of the film (in which Dr. Bennell desperately tries to enlist the help of strangers while in the middle of the highway) is extremely well-executed (and the only truly great acting performance of the entire film). Even the admittedly shoddy writing is better than it first appears, as it offers a nuanced social critique that can easily be interpreted as either anti-Communist or anti-McCarthiest (aka, anti-Conformist).Fans of both sci-fi and horror films (as well as films that touch on the psyche of paranoia during the cold war) will genuinely enjoy this well-aged classic. Likewise, anybody who's seen "The Faculty" (1998) should enjoy seeing that film's antecedent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrifying and Terrific!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Invasion of the Body Snatchers is an eerily brilliant sci-fi film. It is genuinely scary and thrilling when viewed now, so it must have been extremely unsettling for audiences in 1956.Director Don Siegel didn't have a big budget, so he cast Kevin McCarthy as Dr. Miles Bennell, who returns from a medical convention to the small Californian town of Santa Mira. He is confronted with strange reports of people insisting their relatives aren't their relatives. He begins to uncover the shocking mystery, but is convinced that his mind is playing tricks on him. However, his initial fears are true as the living nightmare unfolds.Siegel doesn't rely on special effects to scare the audience, but its B-movie feel and subtle horrors are more effective. It is a short film, 80mins, so the story moves along at a quick pace, further heightening the fear level of viewers. Shot in black and white, the emotions (or lack of) shown by the characters are extremely convincing.The themes of this film, such as anti-McCarthyism and fear of communism, were relevant in 1956, and it is frequently cited as one of the examples of exploring these themes to great effect. It is also cited as one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time, certainly of the 1950s. It certainly towers of hundreds of other sci-fi films with larger budgets, and can take its place at the top table of the genre classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can watch these kind of 'allegorical' movies without thinking about the political undertones. It's usually more enjoyable if you don't. I certainly didn't when I watched this one and the 1978 remake with Leonard Nimoy and Donald Southerland. Was it really 30 years ago? Hard to believe. The remake was good but not as good as the original. It doesn't really have any connection to McCarthy either, that I can tell, but thinking about it, I definitely remember an overplayed focus on the 'transformed' people having no emotions. No love or hate. Only their minds have changed.Thinking about the political aspect of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, however, for me, makes re-watching it even more frightening. Even the worst of us love a good scare from time to time. There have been a few movies done this way, and a lot more that you can argue were done this way, having allusions to events in the real world separate from the movie. Here I guess the idea is that, in a plot spreading out from 'Santa Mira' California, citizens are being transformed into shallow, 'emotionless', unfeeling, copies of their former-selves. They are being taken over. Forgetting about or even disdaining their former cares.It's a very frightening paranoiac movie building up to total hysteria. One of those movies where, the audience and the main character know about some danger to the town, or to all humanity, but they have trouble convincing the townsfolk. Sometime the local sheriff listens. Sometimes he doesn't. Of course in the real life events this movie refers to no one listened to Joseph McCarthy - oops Kevin McCarthy.There have been endless movies done in this paranoiac manner since, especially Sci Fi movies. This one is done pretty well. Was going to rate the movie as 9 out of 10 but I see I've already rated it as a 10. No need to change it now. By todays standards it probably only deserves an 8 or 9, but that's still very high.I'm not sure what to make of the reviews that do discuss this movies hidden politics. Most of them reduce the truth by saying, "Does this movie stand for cold war paranoia and the evils of McCarthism, Or does it stand for McCarthy trying to warn us of danger?" In a sense providing a movie review version of moral relativism. Other reviews (not all of them intentionally) revise, or invert the truth, in the same way as would, say, the Body Snatcher, "This movie highlights the danger of McCarthyism" or something is the idea.Must The Body Snatchers control every final thought? Is there no where safe? Can there be no happy ending?They, the media, haven't been very kind to us, but they've always given us Sci Fi. Must even that be taken away?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Regarded as the Scariest Movie of Its Era -- Early Masterpiece of SF and Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" has been lauded by many living Hollywood directors and producers as the scariest movie of its era. Although author Jack Finney always played down the analogy that the story paralleled some of the political and societal paranoia of the 20th century (from the rise of Communism to McCarthyism), it ranks as one of the best films of its type, partially because of the leanness of the script and the fine acting. Finney insisted that it was simply a good story and had nothing to do with political or social commentary. But a writer is not always the best interpreter of his own work.The story is relatively simple, and that's how Finny began it. At first, a strange man, seeming close to paranoia, runs into the busy streets of a town. He is Dr Bennell and resides in the next nearest town. After being picked up and taken to a precinct by local police, Bennell tells his story. A few weeks early, people in his town started coming to him not to for medical treatment but for another reason. They think their spouses and/or closest friends and family are somehow different. (Apparently Finny began with this premise and did not know the "how" of the story until later.) Tentatively Dr Bennell dismisses their concerns, thinking that it is just a psychological reaction to stress or some other rational explanation. The movie almost acts nonchalantly about the first patient. But slowly, more people begin to describe their feelings about those closest to them. Bennell realizes that a pattern is emerging that he can't ignore. Something larger is happening to the town.A great suspense/science fiction/horror drama that probably has no equal in the 1950's. The story takes itself seriously which prevents it from lapsing into comedic farce. And the acting is believable enough to take us all the way. A triumph of film-making on every level and influenced many later movies such as Halloween. This was originally a B picture which shows what filmmakers can do with a small budget but a great script and good actors. Few suspense movies today are as well written.</fullReview>

I'll admit, this is movie is scary as hell, even now. The effects are amazingly simple but still get the job done perfectly. The clones were just terrifying, even demonic at times and it made even my stomach churn when seeing them. Overall, the movie is very well done and quite scary and I recommend it to all lovers of horror classics or any thriller.I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

What if you found out they were alien plant people bent on taking over and not only is there nothing you can do about it, there is a 99 percent chance you will also become a strange plant creature?If this is not chilling, then you are a body snatching plant creature, as they have no emotion. Emotion, feelings of love and hate, the need for sex are all gone and you are something else when your body is snatched.The original "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" is a great classic in which indiviual thinking and acting are taken from you and your closest friends become enemies. If you haven't seen this film before, then I am sorry because not knowing what was to come next was what shocked audiences. It's best if you see the original, not knowing too much to come, and then see the 78 remake that has much of the same dialog and characters, but only updated for the 70's fears and concerns of the time.</fullReview>

This was a film I watched late at night when I was 11 back in the 60's and it scared the pants off me then. It doesn't scare me as much now but it still makes me feel uneasy. When you consider that this was America's covert warning of the Soviet threat you can imaging that it probably had the desired effect.

		<fullReview>I saw this film for the first time in Australia in the late 60's when I was about 9. It was on Marathon TV all night horror and my older sister and I sat through 'The Blob'. Nothing to frighten us there, so at about 1.00 am the invasion of the body snatchers came on and we were not in the least worried. We were when it had finished.Although my sister was 21, I was far too young to be aware of communism or McCartheism so that meant nothing. I wasn't too young to be frightened witless and nor was my sister. The plot is simple but the acting is superb and what makes it all the more frightening is the calm way the invaders try to rationalise their actions. The film is still scary today and knocks spots of the remake, although I did enjoy the way the writers had the ending of the original start the remake with Kevin McCarthy running through the traffic trying to warn people.My abiding moment will be the look of sheer terror on McCarthy's face when he realises that Dana Wynter has succumbed to sleep and be taken over. I have the film on video and still watch and enjoy, so should you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, here we are with those ol' pesky body snatchers. Yes, it appears pod people have taken over a small California town and it's finally up to a skeptical doctor to make people believe him . . . and get out of town while he's still awake. This movie moves at breakneck speed. There isn't a slow moment in the entire thing. The writing is simple (which keeps it from getting hammy) as is the direction (which keeps it from getting slow). But the best part is noticing the not - so - subtle communist subtext.Also, I was surprised to notice that this film really isn't so much a sci-fi pic as much as it is a film noir. All the aspects of noir are there . . . and Invasion of the Body Snatchers stands proudly among such masterworks as Kiss Me Deadly, and Out of the Past. Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never been a fan of sci-fi movies. However, after getting home from a party, and having drunk 4 cans of soda only twenty minutes before, I decided that sleep was impossible, so instead, I turned on my TV. Nothing much was on, but on AMC, a favorite of mine, Invasion of the Body Snatchers had received 4/4 stars. I decided to watch, thinking I would end up turning it off. I was wrong. I became engrossed in the movie, watching Kevin McCarthy's character completely go off the deep end. The acting was fantastic, the characters were realistic, and the story line kept you on the edge of where ever you were sitting. Dana Wynter's transformation was done with incredible acting skills, and looked quite terrifying, not to mention a little heart-breaking. I kept me a little afraid to sleep that night, in case I would be take over. Sort of. A true, terrifying classic. 10/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest B-Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of this film -- everyone you know is disappearing and being replaced by a soulless lookalike -- is so disturbing that you're willing to forgive some less-than-brilliant dialogue ("Do you want me to stay, darling?" "Of course not!"), less-than-stellar film-making (the faces cut off in reaction shots, the bombast near the end) and less-than-Oscar-caliber acting (the supporting cast includes "Dick Van Dyke" flunky Mel Cooley Folgers Coffee spokesswede Mrs. Olson). But every masterpiece has its flaws, and all of the weakness I've listed probably wouldn't have existed if "Invasion" had a real budget. I'm not saying this movie is "Citizen Kane." I'm saying it's better - more subtle, more involving, more disturbing.At a superficial level, "Invasion" is an effective sci-fi film that capitalizes on a good, simple idea. The film also tricks you into thinking that it's anti-communist propaganda what with the creeping paranoia and gradual subversion of a quaint little American town. But if you pay closer attention, you notice that the movie is really addressing depersonalization -- uneasy or different characters are replaced by pod-person doubles with no problems. A little boy becomes terrified of his mother? Bam! He's absorbed and his fears vanish. Frumpy spinster Wilma Lentz, played by future Folgers flogger Virginia Christine, notices an change in her uncle's behavior that she can't define but find unnerving? Bam! She's absorbed and there are no more worries. If this terror at the thought of homogenization sounds particular to the 1950s, think of "The Stepford Wives" ("Invasion of the Body Snatchers" with a feminist bent and worse acting) or "Shaun of the Dead" ("Invasion of the Body Snatchers" with lots of gore and British drollery). It's a fear we face in every era, whether the culprit is communism, sexual repression or Prozac. If this film were standard Hollywood anti-commie agitprop, I seriously doubt the main characters would be two divorced people.Miles, played by Kevin McCarthy, and Becky, played by Dana Wynter, are recovering from bad marriages and there's more than a hint that these two consenting adults are kickin' it (and with good reason -- no one wears a sundress quite like Dana). All around this non-standard pair, the human, quirky small town where they live melts into an undifferentiated pool of bland domesticity. And it might happen to them, too, if they fall asleep, i.e. lose awareness. Way existential, as Cher said in "Clueless." Director Don Siegel creates a very cool, very noir inversion of our standard semiotic universe by making dark, cramped spaces into refuges and making well-lit, spacious, populated spaces menacing and sinister. So day is night, darkness is light. A creepy, brilliant flick that was a bargain to make and a scream to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the overall effect this movie had. There are some holes in the story for sure, but it works on many levels. The mystery starts and builds slowly at first and then more rapidly. This is to mysteries and sci-fis what "Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" is to comedies. Step by step and then faster and faster. The lead actor, Kevin McCarthy, looks a lot like Rick Nelson in some of his scenes. The director does a good job of putting in enough surprises and a few low cost special effects which are more fun to watch than today's computerized morphings. This movie would be a good one to watch at home with a few friends and some popcorn on a Saturday night. A good movie for old car buffs. OK for most youngsters. There are thousands of great 50s movies. I would put this in the top 100 overall. Hard to compare it to other sci-fis. It would be up there with "The Day the Earth Stood Still" but more casual. This movie seems to have been written for Fred MacMurray and Shelley Winters. I liked it.</fullReview>

So perfectly scripted and acted stuff.Invaders From Mars is another 1950s film that resembles this one, see also TV's Wonder Woman: The Boy Who Knew Her Secret (1980), see also The Outer Limits: The Invisibles (1964)...many other shows resemble this film as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dr. Miles Bennell (superbly played by Kevin McCarthy) suspects that something might be amiss in the sleepy small town of Santa Cruz after various people start behaving in an odd and detached manner.Director Don Siegel grounds the fascinating fantastic premise in a thoroughly believable workaday rural reality, adroitly crafts a supremely creepy and unsettling atmosphere, and likewise creates with equal expertise a quietly unnerving sense of mounting dread and paranoia that gradually builds to a shattering fever pitch in the harrowing last third. Daniel Mainwaring's ingenious script makes a profound and powerful statement on how our capacity to feel all kinds of emotions and desire for individual identity are two key important traits that make all of us special and human (if deprived of these two traits, we are reduced to the level of bland and emotionless automatons). McCarthy and Dana Wynter as the smitten Becky Driscoll make for personable leads; they receive excellent support from Larry Gates as the skeptical Dr. Dan Kauffman, King Donovan as the worried Jack Belicec, Carolyn Jones as the shaken Theodora, and Virginia Christine as the distraught Wilma Lentz. Both the crisp noir-like black and white cinematography by Ellsworth Fredericks and Carmen Dragon's spirited shivery score are up to par. Worthy of its classic status.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear, Paranoia &amp; Lost Humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like so many of the sci-fi horror films that were so popular in the 1950s, this movie is about an alien invasion but that's where the similarity ends. This movie doesn't feature monsters, violent deaths or scenes of widespread destruction but instead focuses on a far more insidious threat that seems impossible to stop and robs people of their humanity. This quiet invasion deprives its victims of their individuality, their emotions and even their objectivity because, after being transformed, the people concerned are conditioned to believe that a life without love, desire, ambition and faith is not only simpler but also preferable to the way in which they'd lived previously. The full horror of what takes place is conveyed through the experience of a small town doctor who, as a result of all that he sees and learns, goes from being perfectly calm and rational to being hysterical, terrified and completely out of control.It's in this highly agitated state that Dr Miles Bennell (Kevin McCarthy) is admitted to a hospital emergency room where he's invited by a psychiatrist to describe the events that led to his current meltdown. Bennell explains that, following a request from his nurse, he'd returned to his Santa Mira practice from a medical convention to deal with a sudden high demand for his services but, on his return, the numerous patients who'd wanted to see him urgently, had changed their minds. It soon became evident however, that something unusual was going on in the town because first a little boy who insisted his mother wasn't his mother was brought in to see him and then, he visited his ex-girlfriend's cousin who'd reported that her uncle wasn't her uncle. As there didn't seem to be any rational explanation for the apparent delusions that these people were suffering, Bennell had spoken to local psychiatrist Dr Kauffman (Larry Gates) who thought that, what was happening was probably an epidemic of mass hysteria.Bennell started to rekindle his romance with Becky Driscoll (Dana Wynter) who, like him, had recently been divorced. When the couple were out on a date one night, he'd received a telephone request to visit his friend Jack Belicec (King Donovan) who'd found, what looked like, a human body on his pool table. Disturbingly, it resembled Jack but didn't have any fingerprints or all of his facial features. Later, Bennell also found a similar incomplete duplicate of Becky in the basement of her house but when he called in Dr Kaufmann to see the "bodies", they'd disappeared and so Kaufmann simply assumed that Bennell was as deluded as some of his patients.When Bennell, Becky, Jack and his wife Teddy (Carolyn Jones) were together one night at Bennell's greenhouse and saw replicas of themselves emerging from huge seed pods, it became clear to Bennell that the townsfolk were being replaced by duplicates and that the changeover was taking place when they were sleeping. Bennell tried to contact the FBI for assistance but failed because the telephone operator repeatedly told him that the lines were busy and soon, after seeing further evidence that confirmed his theory and realising that he and Becky were the only citizens left in the town who hadn't been replaced, decided that they had to go on the run. The events that followed had then led to his breakdown.Screenwriter Daniel Mainwaring's brilliant adaptation of Jack Finney's original story called "The Body Snatchers", features dialogue that's both economical and effective and this together with Don Seigel's superb direction clearly played a major part in the success of this movie which now enjoys classic status. Seigel injects great energy, drive and pace into the action and also does a great job of building the looming sense of paranoia which becomes ever more prevalent as Bennell's predicament makes him increasingly isolated and desperate. The scene in which Bennell and Becky hide in a trench and watch their pursuers run over the planks that cover them is quite inspired and perfectly executed.The fears expressed on this movie (e.g. loss of identity, individuality and humanity) reflected the anxieties of many people in the Cold War 1950s and explains why some commentators suggested that Bennell's story had an anti-communist, anti-McCarthyite subtext which Mainwaring and Kevin McCarthy claimed was never intended.The quality of the acting in "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" is consistently good with Kevin McCarthy's performance standing out because of the range of emotions that he expresses so convincingly and the terror that he conveys so powerfully, especially in some of his close-ups. His performance was also vital to the movie's success because the whole story revolves around his character's experience.I</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a teenager in the Fifties, we went to see movies with the most outlandish titles. Expecting the usual rubber monsters and hackneyed plots, you can imagine our near- speechless response at movie's end. (We were relieved by the upbeat ending.) Despite the film's breath-taking accomplishments, it soon faded into obscurity, undone no doubt by the catch-penny title and B-movie budget. Revived periodically on TV, it quickly attracted a cult following, finally emerging from the late night underground to become the widely recognized classic that it is. There are few movies that connect at a deeply subconscious level with the audience. This is one of them, and can now be seen as a parable, not only of the 50's Red menace (Scriptwriter Dan Mainwaring was briefly blacklisted), but of the many depersonalized encounters that fill the ordinary day. The movie's one flaw - the "pop-out" replicas that make a distinctly rubbery sound as they pop from the pods in the greenhouse scene, a technical defect that may have inspired the f-x'ed remake. Frankly, I'm concerned that contemporary teens may not find this a scary or affecting movie. Styles do change as does technology, but the underlying theme that Bodysnatchers renders so effectively is timeless. Perhaps the mind- snatching forces of commercialism are winning after all. Nevertheless, for this now 60- something, my teenage quarter was never better spent than on this film, nor will yours if you haven't seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A B picture for the thinking person.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Finney's serialized novel came to the screen for the first time with this extremely memorable sci-fi thriller. It exploits the paranoia of the Cold War era for full effect, offering up an intelligent exploration of what it means to be human. The themes of falling victim to mindless conformity, and the loss of individuality and identity, still resonate 60 years later. Directed with maximum efficiency by Don Siegel, who at this time hadn't yet graduated to big budget, A pictures, it has a wonderfully stark atmosphere, and an intense, breakneck pace. It can also appeal to more modern genre fans due to some nice "eww" moments and decent special effects. It's all heightened by the excellent black &amp; white SuperScope photography by Ellsworth Fredericks and ominous music by Carmen Dragon.Kevin McCarthy stars as Dr. Miles Bennell, returning home to the small town of Santa Mira in time to experience a mass hysteria. Citizens are concerned that their friends &amp; family are no longer recognizable as the people they love; that they now lack human emotion. Hooking up with the lovely Becky Driscoll (Dana Wynter), Miles must race against time to stop this "disease" from spreading."Invasion of the Body Snatchers" is a wonderfully sensational title, and the film delivers on its promise of good, old fashioned genre entertainment. It's cast with fine actors and actresses from top to bottom: Larry Gates as a psychiatrist, King Donovan and Carolyn Jones as Miles' friends the Belicecs, Jean Willes as Miles' nurse Sally, Ralph Dumke as the police chief, Virginia Christine as Becky's friend Wilma, and Dabbs Greer as Mac the service station proprietor. Keep your eyes peeled for future director Sam Peckinpah, who plays Charlie the meter reader.The studio-imposed prologue and epilogue with Whit Bissell and Richard Deacon is the only real drawback, diminishing the effectiveness of what would have been a pretty chilling conclusion.Nine out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Invasion of the Body Snatchers is directed by Don Siegel, has a screenplay by Daniel Mainwaring, is based on the novel by Jack Finney and stars Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter.This is one of the best science fiction films ever made. Instead of aliens landing in spaceships and trying to make contact with us or destroy us from outer space, the aliens in this film invade us and kill us, replacing us with identical duplicates which lack emotion. This film perfectly captures the feelings of hysteria and paranoia such an event would cause. The film can also be seen as an allegory for the so called threat of the day which was communism. In this film people look at everyone with suspicion and paranoia is rampant.The film opens with a deeply distressed Miles Bennell(Kevin McCarthy)arrested by Police and begging for people to listen to what he has to say. He claims that there has been an alien invasion. We then see in flashback what he has experienced.Doctor Miles Bennell returns home to his small town and stumbles upon a nightmare. He has many patients contacting him claiming that family members are not who they say they are. Miles suspects some sort of mass hysteria but as time goes on he notices that people are acting strangely.A strange seed pod is found at his friends house and Miles discovers a growing duplicate of his girlfriend Becky(Dana Wynter).Soon almost everyone in town is replaced by an alien duplicate, these duplicates look human but they have no emotions. The pod people are sending their seed pods out of town to other towns and cities to take over more people. Miles and Becky try and escape the town to warn other people what is happening but are pursued by the pod people.This film is truly chilling and is still very effective today. I like this version very much but my favourite is the 1978 remake starring Donald Sutherland, that is truly chilling and the pod people's scream is one the scariest things I've ever heard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Parts of the narrative are a little vague, but the suspense and intrigue more than compensate for this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon returning from a convention, Dr Miles Bennell (Kevin McCarthy) discovers that some people in the town are claiming that their relatives look the same, but notice slight differences in their personalities. Bennell is initially sceptical and dismisses these claims as 'mass hysteria'. However, when he digs a little deeper Bennell starts to believe that this might be more than hysteria and tries to convince a cynical psychologist Danny Kauffman (Larry Gates)that some other worldly beings may be responsible for these strange occurrences.Invasion Of The Body Snatchers is a nice little film that gets going pretty much straight away - a no nonsense film that is devoid of pointless filler. It's played out as a mystery and it's a relatively suspenseful film whereby you're constantly wondering what's making the townspeople mad? What do they want? Etc. The story itself was quite ground-breaking for its time and it's also a very interesting film.Although this film was ground-breaking and interesting, I did find that it was a little vague in some areas; we learn that these 'beings' take control of people's minds and bodies when they're asleep, but the writers never bother explaining how this is done - is it some kind of mind transfer? It also doesn't explain how they jam the telephone network? On a personal note, I would have also liked it if we'd have seen more social commentary on how this mind control affected the townspeople. We see little snippets of it but I think it might have made the film slightly more interesting and slightly stronger as a whole if this aspect would have been expanded upon and given a little more focus.Despite this though, there are enough selling points here to make this worth watching; the performances across the board were excellent and all the main players show a certain intensity that makes it very easy to get swept up in their plight. McCarthy overacts occasionally, but I suppose it's better that he puts too much effort in rather than too little.IOTBS is a very good film that is definitely worth watching. However, for me the story could have done with being fleshed out a little more and for this reason I see it as a very good film that falls just short of brilliance.</fullReview>

Kevin McCarthy plays a paranoid doctor out to warn everyone of the invasion. Pods have landed and seem to possess people while they sleep. A replica results that possesses no feeling of emotion or personality. Director Don Siegel does a terrific job at creating tension out of everyday lifestyles and he is backed by excellent production. We witness the transformation of pods to bodies and its eerie effect. This brings forth the theme of paranoia that holds up within the blooming of those pods. McCarthy holds his own going from normal doctor to fleeing from faces that he only recognizes from the surface. His frantic attempt to warn society is now classic with an ending that remains on the fence in terms of a solution. Dana Wynter plays an ex-girlfriend who appears at his office claiming that something strange is happening to the people around her. When a duplicate of her body is found, they must act. Larry Gates plays a doctor whom attempts to rationalize the situation even after investigating. King Donovan appears as a friend of McCarthy who smells conspiracy. Many of them will become pods drained of emotion or any concept of right or wrong, love or hate. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Craze of the Enemy Within</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a great way to start off this semester of film school with a viewing of this film in sci-fi cinema. I was hooked from the get-go with this film since it employed a form of narrative I love: start towards the end after the hero has experienced his journey and then tell the story of said journey. A simple change in chronology, but it is very effective in other films such as Inception, Sunset Boulevard, and It's a Wonderful Life. Instead of beginning with boring exposition showing the aftermath of the journey usually gives us something to hook us into the story. The film itself reflects the fear of the invasion of communism in America at the time; communists were supposedly among the people of our society in that era, and this gave citizens the fear of an alien nature among us. "Body Snatchers" hints at this slowly at first as people simply "aren't themselves," and it eventually hits us that the "alien nature" among us is literally an alien nature - what a nice metaphor. As the citizens of the small town are replaced by doubles formed in pods, the changed people begin to expand, even harvest these pods in order to spread their emotionless but logical nature throughout the small community. As Miles and the leading lady have still not changed, the doubles confront them and we realize what we fear is that which we do not understand, just like the era of McCarthyism in America. Apparently the director originally wanted the film to end as Miles pronounces "you could be next" directly to the camera - to us - but it was too pessimistic for Hollywood, so they had to install an ending in which there was hope for humanity. This is a great film, but one plausibility factor is the idea that the leading lady simply changes into a double after falling asleep - so why the need for the pods at all in that case? Overall a great science fiction film which I wished was even more critically acclaimed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a double bill of two versions, 1956 and 1978</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A thrilling double-bill of this classic tall-tale of alien body-snatchers, based on Jack Finney's novel, for latter-day audience, perhaps we can still recall the latest remake THE INVASION (2007, 5/10), as a star vehicle for Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig, which was dead on arrival as a major flop and presages their next colossal box-office fiasco THE GOLDEN COMPASS (2007, 4/10). Fortunately these two earlier versions are considerably better than the ill-fated mega-star paycheck product, the original 1954 film is directed by Don Siegel (DIRTY HARRY 1971, 7/10), within a condensed 80 minutes, it delineates the absurd story with a gripping pace and impressive monochromatic cinematography. Miles Bennell (McCarthy) is a small-town doctor, who has just reunited with his sweetheart Becky Driscoll (Wynter), they discover that many townsfolk are progressing into a widespread hysteria and claim their relatives have turned into emotionless where as their pretense remains the same. Soon with another couple Jack and Teddy (Donovan and Jones), they come to grasp that human beings are being duplicated during their sleep by unspecified alien species, things goes downhill quickly, they have to differentiate aliens among people they know, flee for help while try their best to resist the overwhelming sleepiness.Due to the curb of special effects development and budget, the supposedly bone-chilling scenes with human replicas are visibly mannequins covered with foam, and the extraterrestrial seedpods are equally below the groundbreaking line albeit the eery and intense atmosphere is rendered in full throttle. McCarthy exerts sizable effort to maintain the intriguing momentum meanwhile manages to squeeze time to ignite the moment of romance with Wynter, although appearing on screen for most of the screen-time, whose role is inclusively subsidiary, merely as a gorgeous love interest and a shorthand of a secretary. The rest of cast is serviceable but there is no room for any showboating in the taut storyline. Wisely, the film probes into the analysis of humanity-depravity process, even disregard the reference of the purported metaphor for the McCarthyism at then, the sudden action of draining away humanity into a void robot shed an urgent light to our mundane procedure of dehumanizing our personality in a far slower but equally toxic manner. The film starts with a flashback to the horrifying happenings, and the ending echoes Mile's narrative with a more encouraging upshot, which conveniently slackens off the impact of a no-way-out despair when Miles finally reaches the highway, no one stops to listen to him and overtly the seedpods have already been transported to elsewhere to indicate a thorough duplication of our entire race is ominously under way. Plus, one inexplicable mishap is that there is no explanation of what happens to the original body when his or her inexpressive clone comes into life (thankfully, in the 1978 version, it is explicitly demonstrated). The 1978 color version is directed by Philip Kaufman (QUILLS 2000, 6/10), the story is transposed to a metropolitan San Francisco, Matthew Bennell (Sutherland) and Elizabeth Driscoll (Adams) are fellow health inspectors, while Elizabeth is living with her dentist boyfriend Geoffrey (Hindle), screenwriter W.D. Richter upgrades the romance to the mutual attraction between two colleges after Geoffrey firstly being replaced. One striking feature of this remake is to visualize the aliens in a more graphic picture, ever since the opening credits, beholders are fully witnessed how the unearthly life forms arrive and thrive on our planet. Using lurid palette and tilted camera angle to evince that the abnormality is threatening (with a cameo of Robert Duvall), these two stunts are further maneuvered to produce the omnipresent weirdness with the hypnotizing sound effect. From the floral embellishment, to the spooky mud bath, to the paranoiac street mania, Kaufman does modernize the original concept up to the hilt, it is also more scarier and disturbing by default. Sutherland crafts a slow-burning exigency of being a reluctant hero under a rampant panic, the utile assault he is wreaking on the primitive clones and a final howl guarantees his leading status in this overhaul of a telling fiction. 1978 is a breakthrough year for Brooke Adams, starring both Terrence Malick's DAYS OF HEAVEN (1978, 9/10) and this Sci-Fi remake, her Elizabeth is more intuitive and has more initiative to get to the bottom of the mystery, the chemistry between her and Sutherland is also given a full-extent development. Leonard Nimoy, brings a solid supporting role as Dr. David Kibner, masks his ulterior motive instead of being conspicuously opinionated as Larry Gates in the original movie. A youthful Jeff Goldblum is offered very few to perform, whereas Veronica Cartwright, who would be best remembered as a regular in Sci-Fi or fantasy productions (ALIEN 1979, 9/10; THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK 1987, 5/10), assumes the most sleep-resistant character in the climactic finale. The ending is essentially different from the original and the novel itself (where the aliens voluntarily retreat), with its silent end-credits, it surprisingly evokes a sublimated sensation of shock value. Also worth mentioning, Kevin McCarthy and Don Siegel's cameos are signs in homage to the original. Generally speaking both films are of excellency to be viewed by newer generations and personally, I give an edge to Kaufman's more comprehensive achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three Versions and the Novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Critics debate whether this movie is an allegory for communism or the communist witch hunts. In other words, are the pod people supposed to be like communists or like the members of the House Committee on Un-American Activities? My own reaction to this movie, which I saw when I was ten years old, leaves me with no doubt. I was born in 1946, and in the 1950s I heard people talk about communists, and I saw shows on television dramatizing the dangers of communism. Essentially, communists were depicted as being cold and unfeeling, driven only by their ideology toward the goal of a complete takeover of the entire world. This attitude is somewhat parodied in "The Manchurian Candidate" (1962), when the communist Dr. Yen Lo refers to guilt and fear as being peculiar American inventions, when we all know they are natural human feelings. Of course, that movie came much later. In any event, I was too young at the age of ten to say to myself, "These pod people are just like communists, because they have no emotions, and they want to take over the world." But I know I sensed the similarity between the pod people and what I had been told about communists.Unfortunately, as good as this movie is, it has a big plot hole. At first, a pod takes on the form of any person it is near when that person goes to sleep, duplicating everything but his emotions. We never find out what happens to the person when the duplication process is over. Presumably it destroyed and disposed of. But by the end of the movie, the presence of pod no longer seems necessary, and the person himself is altered merely by sleeping. Neither Miles nor Becky have slept near a pod, so no duplicate has been formed. And when Becky does finally fall asleep, there is no pod nearby. Moreover, she only falls asleep for a few minutes, and the duplication process takes much longer than that. And yet, she is completely transformed.Still, this is the best version, and that is mostly because of the stark contrast between the way people are before and after they have slept near a pod. The town of Santa Mira is full of friendly people. We see how warm and loving they are, and so when they are taken over by a pod and become cold and indifferent, we experience a feeling of loss. In the 1978 remake, most of the characters are unlikable to begin with, so every time one of them gets taken over by a pod, there is a definite improvement in his personality. Halfway through the movie, I was pulling for the pods. In "Body Snatchers" (1993), this remake is set on an army base. So, people walk around mindlessly obeying orders without any emotion, and then when they get taken over by a pod, they walk around mindlessly obeying orders without any emotion.The novel had an interesting ending. I haven't read it in a long time, but the way I remember it, Becky and Miles are running away from a mob of pod people, just like in the movie. But when they come to the field where all the pods are growing, Miles uses gasoline to start a fire, which completely destroys the entire crop. When the mob of pod people see what happened, they realize their plans of replacing more humans with duplicates are ruined. Because they have no emotions, they are not angry and do not avenge themselves on Becky and Miles. Instead, they just turn around and walk back home. At the end of the book, Miles says that the population of Santa Mira is slowly declining, and if you ever happen to pass through that town, you will find that the people who live there are quite unfriendly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A science fiction film noir with a subtle warning....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film truly resonates today. In this tale, giant pods are taking over the lives of small town folk, and doctor Kevin McCarthy (just back from a medical convention) has to figure out what's going on. Where these pods come from is never really explained, but that doesn't matter. The viewer can draw their own conclusion. Outerspace? Government conspiracy? You decide. The victims don't feel any pain; They just cease to feel human emotions and desires. Locked up for observation after going crazy on the highway, he tells his story which ultimately has him and girlfriend Dana Wynter on the run from the "pod people". It is obvious that the pod people aren't out to do them harm, simply put them to sleep so the pods can do their work. Their view of a world without emotion means no wars, but it also means no love. And what of reproduction? Is this a Government conspiracy to keep the populace under control, to prevent future wars, to assure the elections going a certain way? Lots of questions will arise in the film's relatively short running time.As a science fiction film, it comes even with "The Day the Earth Stood Still" as to being the best ever made, a rare time when I name a film of this genre in being one of the ten best of its release year. It is also probably the only science fiction film to be almost a "film noir" with its moody photography and its hero in trouble because of something he has discovered about the people around him. The fact that something like this doesn't seem too far fetched in this time of the earth's history makes the film also a bit scary.There are many familiar faces in the film, most notably for me Richard Deacon, Larry Gates and Carolyn Jones. Everybody is outstanding. This is a film that has needlessly been remade several times, but featured a funny reference in the Bette Midler/Lily Tomlin comedy "Big Business". Upon coming across her and Tomlin's twins (separated at birth), Midler's acid tongued business executive screams (while flailing a plunger towards them), "It's Pod People!" Her more innocent other half exclaims, "I saw that movie", to which the look-alike retorts, "I was at the premiere!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ghost of McCarthy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent movie, I agree with the other commentators on that issue: 9/10 In stead of making yet another resumé of the story, let me get a little deeper into the points I do NOT agree with made by almost all commentators. According to Kevin McCarthy, at the time this movie was made, there was no symbolism or allegorical message in it, underlining that Jack Finney never wrote the book with that intent. That sounds a very reasonable explanation to me, which most people seem to want to ignore. It's not the movie-lover who's speaking now, but the political scientist, asking to keep things into historical perspective. It's all too easy to discover the ghost of McCarthy in almost everything that's from the 1950's. First at all, you don't have to be a Goebbels to understand that it would be against the basic rules of propaganda to try to get a political message across by means of a SF movie, using an allegory. Most people who love SF or horror movies surely won't have made a link between this movie and McCarthy at the time. When you are a little bit into political thrillers of that period, you'll know that this kind of "Red scare" messages were presented in a much more straightforward way than through allegories, to make sure the largest possible audience got the message. You want a good example ? Try "Whip Hand" (1951): in this movie, a remote village is taken over by Communists, testing and planning to use WMD against the USA. To make sure even the Simpletons understand how evil and mean the Commies are, they are using a Nazi scientist to conduct these experiments. That's plain, straightforward, just as "Red Menace" or "I married a communist" (Woman on Pier 13) were.Secondly: thinking that Kevin McCarthy was chosen for the lead role because of his family name is quite ridiculous ! Let's not forget that McCarthy had already become a villain by 1954, whose megalomania had led to sneer attacks against some of the most decent people in the Armed Forces. McCarthy and Roy Cohen had become very unpopular by then, and lots of Americans agreed they had gone too far. Furthermore, Hollywood sure wasn't sad that his political career was all over. They had been a victim too of the violent attacks of the Wisconsin senator. And see... 1956 was the year in which Bette Davis played in "Storm Center", which can be viewed as Hollywood's way to close the McCarthy chapter. His downfall led to his heavy drinking, and by 1957, the Senator died, aged not even 50 ! It could be argued with as much basis as for the "Commie"-angle, that this movie is rather depicting the fears of small town people against overworked, overstressed and emotionless people from the big cities, buying into property in their neighborhood, acting cold and distant, not joining the local people in their little bars or cultural activities. So we get a nice juxta position here of rural/town, jovial, pleasant/robotlike, friendly and helpful/cold and distant. Using juxta positions is a commonly used formula in movies. To make a menace even more menacing, you first depict something good, friendly innocent, and then in comes the evil. There are two possibilities: 1) an external menace (aliens like in Bodysnatchers, communists like in Whip hand, psychopaths like in Key Largo or Petrified Forest)or something not clearly defined or paranormal, like in "The Mist". 2) innocence etc suddenly becoming a menace. "Village of the damned" and "Children of the damned" are in which nice and innocent children (in stead of cozy rural America) are taken over by an evil force, that make them extremely clever, emotionless, robotlike and dangerous.So, is there no message at all in this excellent movie ? Maybe it makes more sense to see the movie as just an entertaining thriller. The rest is all speculation.By the way, this psychological state of mind of no longer recognizing family members and friends really exists: it's called a Capgras delusion.(Spoiler alert) Finally: there are indeed some holes in the story (the sudden change of Becky Driscoll after she fell asleep). The biggest hasn't been mentioned in the 3-4 last pages of comment: why would a highly advanced alien invader choose of all places a small village in California ? And why in just one village, and not in hundreds at the same time. But hey, this is a movie, and a very entertaining one: if you can't accept such things, stick to documentaries? It's the magic, stupid ! 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best tribute i can pay to this gripping film is that i watched it for the first time last night and can already remember each scene word for word,which in an 80 minute film is no small achievement! Previously i had been put off by the usual description of it as a "B Movie",but where does this place modern day "blockbusters" such as Armageddon or The Sixth Sense? Compared to Snatchers they would be "Z Movies". Having read through the comments you"ll have a fair idea of the plot--small town doctor discovers that people are being replaced by replicas grown from seed pods-but i think too much emphasis is placed on the allusions to Mc Carthyism [right wing] and Communism [left wing],since the the story is perfect in its own right.Direction,camerawork and acting [for the 50"s]are taut and inspired,except for a couple of plot holes which were dealt with in the [inferior] 1978 remake i.e how did the pods drain the soul out of the humans and what happened to the human bodies? Special mention must go to Dana Wynter as Mc Nallys simply radiates beauty,intelligence and class-she really lights up the screen! Finally,anyone who likes this movie needs to check out the greatest Science Fiction TV show ever "The Invaders" which was clearly inspired by IOTBS except that the aliens merely assumed alien form and infiltrated the armed forces and government!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I initially saw this movie when it came out in the spring of 1956, it played in the theatres as part of a double feature, which a lot of the science fiction films of that genre did at that time. The particular feature it played with was "The Indestructible Man," which starred Lon Chaney Jr. It's kind of interesting how they both originally came out as grade B science fiction movies and yet one went on to be a cult classic("Invasion of the Body Snatchers") and the other just disappeared into oblivion!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Made on a shoestring by a studio that only rarely threw in the shoe, this adaptation of the Jack Finney novel showed that, though working on that shoestring, Don Siegel could tie knots in something else: stomachs. Siegel, who went on to direct everything from Elvis Presley's best movie ("Flaming Star") to John Wayne's last ("The Shootist"), managed to create a science-fiction classic under the umbrella of a studio that specialized in churning out Bowery Boys comedies. Although it is often regarded as a commentary on McCarthyism, could it not also be an expose of Allied Artists, and Hollywood studios in general? After all, who but a pod could have made those Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall epics, or, for that matter, most of the movies made these days?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Metaphorical Like Most Good Sci-Fi of the Era, But Also Equally Hokey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A well directed, if frequently mocked, narrow little metaphor for the perils of group-think and McCarthyism. It's certainly a product of both its genre and the era, from the wide-eyed straight man constantly running to escape a hidden threat to the blunt, hammer-to-the-temple methods of the plot structure. I most enjoyed the opening act, when the jury was still out on whether the monstrous mimics were real or imagined. Though we can gather our answers from the title alone, it's fun to explore things from the other perspective and the film seems to enjoy dallying in that uncertainty, too. Once the giant, clumsy, man-sized sea pods start showing up, it's time for a hard turn into the cheesy stuff and a subsequent tumble into the usual pit of 1950's sci-fi tropes. The ending is a horrible mismatch, too, quite obviously crammed in at the last moment and completely at-odds with the message and pace of the preceding seventy minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The horror of conformity and its subtle invasion of the mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version has the more successful ending where they find evidence of the pod people and begin to take moves to stop them. The question at the end though, are they too late, and can our hero ever sleep again lest he be absorbed into the collective conscience of the pod people.The movie opens with a man in a hospital talking about aliens who take the shape of people and slowly replace them. The doctors are very sceptical but he tells the story of how he returns to his home town of Santa Mira to find some strange things going on. At first people want to have an appointment with him (as he is a doctor) and then later they cancel it. Others come to him and tell him how people are just not quite right but there is no real evidence that they have been replaced. In fact they have been replaced by pod people. They have no emotion and simply live life and do things but get no enjoyment out of it.Thus this film has two possibilities: it is anti-capitalist, or it is anti-communist. This film is made in 1956, three years after the last HUAC hearing in Hollywood, but it is still considered to fall into the sphere of the communist film. Invasion of the Body Snatchers attacks conformity. This is a very individualist film and that the individual is more important than social unity. As such this would fall into the anti-communist theme. The pod people replace people and it is impossible to tell them apart from the real person except for maybe a gut feeling. There is no process from when they start, except that it comes out of the farms. The pods are grown by farmers who use them to dominate the town. This is probably a subtle warning that it will be from the farm that the problems arise. The farmers are generally struggling and discontent and thus it will be from their farms that a possible communist uprising could begin. Even so, there are numerous other underclasses in the United States, such as the labourers, women, Negroes, and generally any other non-white, non-European person.There is also the anti-capitalist approach to the movie. This movie shows conformity, peer pressure, and the destruction of self and emotion. The anti-capitalist side seems to be more subtle than the anti-communist side for the main character is fighting for individual freedom. The difference is that the change is unnoticeable. Unlike other more anti-communist movies such as Invaders from Mars, and It Conquered the World, the elements in this movie show life as normal with the exception that all emotion is slowly stripped away. Thus this movie could be seen as an anti-capitalist movie disguised as an anti-communist movie.It is the peer pressure and the conformity of the United States that is attacked. How we go to work everyday and do the same things and then one day, when we awake, we have lost our identity, we no longer have any identity. The whole issue around here deals with sleep and how the more we come to accept what is happening, the more we conform to society. This movie seems to try to wake us up and take notice on how the society is becoming much more conformist that all individual will is being pushed out.The peer pressure shown in the film is a similar idea that undermines the capitalist system. Everybody is subject to pressure to conform to social norms, and this pressure takes away the free, individual spirit. This is not a movie where the important people are working to undermine the freedom of the United States, but one where everybody is putting pressure, including his loved one, onto the main character to accept the conversion and not to resist. Invasion of the Body Snatchers does not force us to prepare for a communist invasion, but rather warns us that to continue to move in the same direction, we will lose our identity and become what we hate the most.</fullReview>

The direction is interesting, the actors are good, the sets are huge and the script has all the elements to make it a classic. Even if they don't get all the details right.Director Don Siegel has an interesting approach to the story. His choices of angles are interesting, the scenes are long, the camera follows the actors around, walking them in and out of places. There are a lot of close-ups and they are very effective. Lighting and editing are great, too.The actors are very good. Kevin McCarthy is intense and convincing, Dana Wynter is pretty, charming or scared. Carolyn Jones, King Donovan and Larry Gates are perfect for their roles.The sets are huge. I have no idea if they filmed in a real town or a studio somewhere, but if they are just some sets in a studio, then they are truly impressive. The interiors are also interesting, with attention to detail.The script is a classic. All the elements are there, and they would be repeated and expanded in all later variations on the subject, and there are a lot of them (variations, that is). The details are not always very well thought out, and there is a scene near the end where it is quite impossible to ignore the poor explanations they offer. Other than that, it is a good script and it would have been better, in my opinion, if studio execs wouldn't have decided to change the beginning and the ending, which kinda spoiled the experience. But I guess for the period, when people where scared enough already, it was the better decision to make.Invasion of the Body Snatchers. A short and very intense classic, if not for some less than perfect choices. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A derivative story to Robert Heinlein's "Puppet Master" except that how the alien takes control is not obvious. Is the whole body just replicated, or does it get taken over mentally ? It's not clear from the movie.Dr Benett (Kevin McCrthy) is a small town doctor. One day when he goes out for a drive with his girlfriend Becky (Dana Wynter), a boy comes running out on the street almost getting runned over by his car. Later, the boy's grand mother brings the boy to his office claiming that the boy is upset over something. The boy is claiming that his mother is not his mother anymore. Thinking that the boy has over active imagination, Benett sends the boy to his grand mother's house for the night. Later that evening his friend finds a strange "replica" of a body and asks him to come and take a look. At inspection, the replica seems to be some sort of unfinished version of an actual person. Then they notice that more of them are growing in the greenhouse. Then it dawns on him that what the boy was saying was true, and the town is being taken over by the strange creatures that resembles a giant pea pod.This movie precedes the movie version of the Puppet Master by 20 years, and was better known for a long time. In terms of the production, this movie is superior to the Puppet Master or its own remake starring Donald Sutherland.The movie is in one hand a science fiction about an invasion from outer space, but on the other hand is a social drama depicting how vulnerable we are to covert take over of our society. It shows our mentality to believe everything is normal and prefer security over freedom. If the invasion took over the authority, infrastructure, and the government like it did in this movie, it would be relatively easy to take over the populace. We may be under such invasion right now, not by aliens but few people who controls the government, the media, and the financial system. The loss of freedom over security might be a very real scenario.Our society is turning into the caricature of this movie with people walking around with their iPODs. We're happy living this way as people in this movie were after they're taken over by the pod.Will we listen to Dr. Benett if he shows up in our society ? Will we give him the time of the day to see if what he's saying has any truth ? If not, we may be under attack, and never find out about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Pods are a nomadic race of extraterrestrial, plant-like organisms whose propagules ? metre-long seeds pods ? drifted for years across the gulf of space, before landing in a terrestrial field outside the fictional town of Santa Mira, California. A Pod has the ability to perfectly replicate the body of any lifeform in its proximity, including humans. While its host organism is asleep, the Pod is able to extract its mind and memories, before the host body presumably disintegrates. The Pod, thus a perfect replica of its host, can now infiltrate the species' community relatively undetected, and aid the further proliferation of the Pod race.The Pods in 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956)' have been variously understood to represent: the Soviet Communist threat of invasion; the tyranny of McCarthyism; and the homogenisation of values through social and corporate conformity. In the 1950s, citizens of the United States faced the daily prospect of nuclear war, the immediacy of this threat typified by such civil defence films as 'Duck and Cover (1952).' In 'Body Snatchers,' Dr Kauffmann (Larry Gates) initially describes the Pod invasion ? which comes "out of the sky" as would an enemy rocket ? as a mass delusion caused by "worry about what's going on in the world," namely the Soviet threat.The "alien invasion" trope stretches back to H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds (1898), in which Martian invaders lay waste to Victorian Britain. This novel has been interpreted as a sharp criticism of British colonialism, with Wells upending the usual hierarchy by casting Britain as the "colonised" rather than the "coloniser". Unlike "War of the Worlds," however, Body Snatchers depicts an invasion that is described as "slowly, not all at once." This reflects the indirect nature of the Cold War compared to previous American conflicts, a dispute largely characterised by political tension, proxy wars, and ideological conflict, rather than full-blown combat.The transformed Pod-people attempt to recruit Miles (Kevin McCarthy) and Becky (Dana Wynter) with the promise of "an untroubled world ... where everyone's the same," recalling the promises of egalitarianism made by Communist utopianism. The Pod-people are incapable of, among other emotions, ambition and faith. The former is a quintessential value of American capitalism, and the latter was forcibly targeted in the official Soviet policy of state atheism (also known as gosateizm). The use of plant physiology is consistent with contemporary descriptions of Communism as a "weed" or similar contagion.'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' was adapted from Jack Finney's novel "The Body Snatchers," originally published as a serial in "Collier's Magazine" in 1954. The novel is strongly influenced by Robert Heinlein's "The Puppet Masters (1951)," in which human minds are controlled by puppeteer alien parasites. Heinlein's novel draws overt parallels between the aliens and Communist Russia, perhaps strengthening the argument that 'Body Snatchers' intended a similar theme. The premise of Philip K. Dick's short story "The Father-Thing (1954)," in which a boy believes his father to have been replaced by an alien impostor, also bears an uncanny resemblance to several scenes in this film.A contradictory thematic interpretation ? less convincing, but given weight through screenwriter Daniel Mainwaring's run-ins with the Hollywood blacklist ? views Pod-people as the result of rampant McCarthyism. The film's protagonists are betrayed by family and friends, who systematically bow to the unrelenting pressure of society and its authorities. The Pod-people are allowed to proliferate when citizens fall asleep; this lapse of vigilance may represent the middle-class complacency that allowed such policies to become dominant under Senator Joseph McCarthy's tenure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply great for a genre movie of its time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I can definitely see how this movie feels and looks outdated to some people. However if you look at this movie at it from the perspective of the time that it got made in, it's being a great genre movie, that is original as well.As far as alien-invasion movies go, the story for "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" always have been one of the best and certainly most original ones around. It's also being a somewhat realistic story, at least when you compare it to all of the other genre movies that came out around the same years as this one did.The set-up of the story is great and very effective. It's being mysterious and the movie doesn't try to explain too much which only adds more to the mystery, that in return also adds more to the tension of the movie. You could say that it's a minimalistic movie, which works out very well. The movie didn't even cost halve a million to make and it didn't had the backing of any big studio's.It's a bit surprising that this movie got directed by Don Siegel. A man that isn't exactly well known for being a director in the science-fiction genre. His action movies and westerns are far better known and he's best known for his collaborations with Clint Eastwood. This is just not the type of movie which you would normally expect from him. It shows his much wider range as a director and his talent for it of course.And then the eternal question of which movie is better; the original or the remake. And with remake I of course mean the 1978 version, not any of the other ones. In my opinion it's the remake that is being the better movie. It does more with its main premise and has a better, more mysterious and tense story. But in all honesty, both movies are also quite different from each other. They basically have different plot-lines, different settings, different story-telling and different characters in it. Both can easily be seen as totally independent from each other movies, that you can both watch and enjoy and see as two different movies, that only share the same main premise with each other.A very effective- and original for its time, movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Commie paranoia makes more 50's SF goodness...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Science Fiction ThrillerI don't know if I've mentioned this before or not (I'm kidding, I know I've mentioned it plenty), but I really love movies about paranoia. And since I was raised on a near-steady stream of 50's Horror and Science Fiction, I'd have to say I've seen a good number of paranoia films. As we all know, or anyone who loves movies knows, the 50's was rife with extreme paranoia and crazy Science Fiction films--all of them burying the fear of Communism or nuclear war heavily into their scripts. Take a film like this one, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, dice into it a thick paranoid atmosphere, and place it smack dab into Cold War paranoid 1950's America and you can easily see why this film was so instantly famous.This is one of Science Fiction's all-time classic films. People suddenly aren't who they seem. Their character and nature, their freedom and humanity--poof! Gone! All that remains is an identical, though emotionless, freedomless human-like shell, now inhabited by something other-worldly. And all because they fell asleep. What's worse is, suddenly, these inhuman humans seem to be popping up everywhere. Finally, our heroes are left fleeing for their lives, with no where to run, and no one to trust.Here's the breakdown:The Good:--This film might have been moderately successful for it's story alone in the fifties--what with the paranoia and fear and all--but what really makes it shine is the immensely thick atmosphere. Suddenly, you don't just witness the paranoia--you live it.--Helping along that excellent atmosphere is some dazzling cinematography. Sharp angles and even sharper lighting and shadows, it's edgy, tense, and gritty all at the same time. Very clear picture, not grainy or muddy.--Above average acting for the time, and excellent for a B-movie, which is what this was originally intended to be.--Tons of suspense, but this is a movie that builds tension and fear and compounds it with rampant paranoia, so it better have some great suspense.--The story builds quite well. Very nice pacing.--Nice sets and backgrounds.Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:--The music, thought dated, is still quite good. It's one of those key elements so necessary in a film of this nature to keep the suspense high.--Above average special effects for the time. Though, really rather brief. This film didn't have a huge budget, nor did it depend on spiffy special effects. In the long term, this has probably actually helped out the film's notoriety. Without gratuitous dated special effects to hold it back, the film was allowed to age gracefully aided by the story and atmosphere.--No nudity or gore. This is the 50's, man! Just good clean fun delivered in a scary package of total fear!--Decent, above-average dialog for the time and style.The Bad:--The underlying "paranoia of Communism" theme, and the film's full impact, is likely to be lost on many modern viewers. Which is really unfortunate. Know your history, then watch this movie.--Almost no character development. But then again, this movie is about people losing all their character and humanity, so... The Ugly:--The story might be seen as being unintentionally humorous by some of today's viewers. However, this relates to the film's actual impact. "Beware the pods!!"--Scenes in moving cars--that background sure is whipping by!!Memorable Scene:--Seeing the people move en masse into the street for a single purpose.Fun Facts:--Originally had a much, much darker ending. One that reeked of hopelessness, doom, and failure. But those lousy film executives just had to go and ruin it and return some bit of hope to the human race!--Remade in 1978 and again in 1993.--Our hero in the '56 version has a cameo in roughly the same role in the 1978 version.Acting: 9/10 , Story: 10/10 , Atmosphere: 10/10 , Cinematography: 10/10 , Character Development: 7/10 , Special Effects/Make-up: 7/10 , Nudity/Sexuality: 0/10 , Violence: 5/10 (just some fighting, but that's not the point of this film) , Gore: 0/10 , Dialog: 8/10 , Music: 8/10 , Direction: 10/10 Cheesiness: 3/10 , Crappiness: 0/10Overall: 9/10If you're a Science Fiction fan, or paranoia-horror fan, you simply have to include this in your viewing. It's as necessary as viewing Jaws, or Psycho, or Night of the Living Dead. You can't be a fan of Science Fiction/Horror without seeing it. All the better if you're a fan of paranoia flicks like John Carpenter's remake of The Thing or the SF film The Puppetmasters (not the Full Moon movies about killer dolls). Also one for classic and general "hardcore" film buffs. Highly recommended.www.ResidentHazard.com</fullReview>

If the "change" occurs gradually and eventually finishes up if/when you fall asleep, "even for an instant", what purpose do the "pods" serve? It's the same problem that the remake of Stpeford Wives didn't avoid, i.e. that the plot as presented in the meat of the film is completely discarded by the climax. I mean, can the "wives" spit out money after the ATM card is inserted orally? Are they robots or brainwashed? I digress... Aside from this glaring problem of plot mechanics and unlike the StepWives, the movie is excellent AND unbelievably dated. Does every doctor in 1950-land drink heavily?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sci-fi classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a sci-fi classic and is still fun to watch more than 50 years after it was made in 1953. The Thing, The Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Them and The Day the Earth Stood Still are the 1950's movies all fans of sci-fi should see. The Thing was the original hostile alien movie but Invasion of the Body Snatchers takes it to the larger scale of global takeover. This film is full of suspense, mystery, creepiness and is genuinely eerie in some scenes. Dr Miles Bennel (Kevin McCarthy) returns to Santa Mira, California, the small town where he practices family medicine. Some of his patients complain that their relatives are impostors. He meets his childhood sweetheart Becky Driscoll (Dana Wynter). Along the way his friend Jack (King Donovan) and his wife Theodora (Carolyn Jones) become involved in the mystery.Directed in black and white by veteran director Don Siegel. Siegel directed the first Dirty Harry movie with Clint Eastwood and worked with him again on Escape From Alcatraz. Many of Siegel's other movies are also worth seeing including The Shootist, Charley Varrick, and Coogan's Bluff.Invasion of the Body Snatchers is often interpreted as a metaphor against McCarthy-ism, communism or totalitarianism.The film has two versions with different endings; the "revised" version has a prologue and an epilogue but the "original" version does not. The revised version was forced on Siegel by the studio. Avoid the colorized version of the movie. The movie was remade with Donald Sutherland.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A small town fugitive doctor spins his tale of horror of how his small town, including the woman he loved, was taken over by pod people.Hokey as it may be in places, this is still a great piece of cult science fiction, which has accumulated comparisons to the communist witch hunts of the McCarthy era along with the whole idea of the dehumanization of humanity, the loss of identity, and all the rest. Is eternal tranquility worth giving up emotions like love, fear, hate, anger and envy? Is it really? Would YOU give it all up? Remade in 1978 with Donald Sutherland, Jeff Goldblum and Leonard Nimoy. Kevin McCarthy, the hero of this version, cameos in the remake along with director Don Siegel. Look for Sam Peckinpah as the gas man. McCarthy screaming "They're here! They're here!" on the highway is almost mimicked by Charlton Heston in "Soylent Green" when he starts screaming "Soylent Green is PEOPLE!"</fullReview>

Nice photography and acting, especially from McCarthy in the lead. A very solid sci-fi concept for a movie -- most try for too much or too little. I saw it when I was a kid and it really scared me (that must have been in 83 or 84). A bit too much has been interpreted on cold-war paranoia terms. The film deserves a broader type of thinking to relate metaphoric allusions to appeal to any person. I guess it's about the dissolution of personality -- its uniqueness. Scary stuff, one of the best shockers of the 50s.</fullReview>

He's planting the seeds of communism.Credit is certainly due to Don Siegel for breaking the conventional mold for 50s sci-fi, and for incorporating elements of 'film noir' into the cinematography [Don't believe me? Go back and watch the greenhouse scene], but please... take it easy on the anti-Communist propaganda.No emotions, no love, no faith.. and if you even shut your eyes to sleep, then it's all over. You're one of them. Unsuspecting, patriotic Americans won't even be able to tell the difference. And you're next. You're next.I'm sure this film would have scared me witless if I'd been around for the Cold War, believing my way of life to be threatened. But 45+ years later, I'm just not buying it.Still, 'Invasion' is a good film. It's put together better than most old science-fiction films, and the acting is definitely above par [makes you wonder why in his twilight years, McCarthy was starring in films like Ghoulies III] for the genre and time. I'd recommend giving it a watch, if only for a classic SF romp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An allegory on Communism or McCarthyism?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a very scary horror film about pods from space who take over a small town. It is also a great allegory, but what on? Some see it as an allegory on the spread of Communism. Others see it as an allegory on the spread of McCarthyism.Certainly the portrayal of the pod people is how Americans perceived the Russians in the fifties, cold and emotionless. The way the pod people are put to work toiling in the greenhouses resembles how Russians were put to work during Stalin's five year plans. The way the new ideology starts among the neighbors and then spreads across the country certainly resembles how Americans saw the spread of Communism in their country. On the other hand...Notice how right from the beginning, the police are in on the conspiracy. They are the force that rounds up all the non-conformers as enemies. Notice too how all the townfolk help the police round up anyone who shows an emotion or independent thought. This resembles the ultra-conservative force of McCarthyism that was sweeping the country in the fifties.Which is the correct interpretation? I would love to hear any opinions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real Gem!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Small *spoilers* ahead. This is a gem from the 50's with a strong cast. Many see it as an allegory of communism or McCarthyism but it also may illustrate fear of conformity to society in the days of Cold War paranoia. Or you can watch it with no underlying theme for just good viewing. Filmed in black and white, as it should have been, it presents a sense of foreboding even in the bright sunlit streets of Santa Mira. Kevin McCarthy has one of his strongest roles as the doctor who gets drawn into a mystery which turns into a nightmare. Dana Wynter is lovely as his girlfriend who fights to stay awake but finally gives in much to our chagrin. Her playing of the transformation scene is perfect....totally emotionless face and blank eyes. The supporting cast is made up of familiar faces....Carolyn Jones, King Donovan and Larry Gates. The rather awkward title does not really tell the whole story.....this is not a guts and gore film.There are few special effects(they are well done)and the horror is more cerebral than physical. It's the kind of movie that sends those icy fingers up your spine. Kevin McCarthy's panicky run through the traffic is a highlight of the film and you know how he feels when nobody believes him. He repeated this run in a cameo appearance in the remake (a film not up to the standards set by the original.) See this movie.....it is a classic. And if you hear somebody say "You're next", look behind you...the pods are after you!</fullReview>

Nevertheless, the power of the story still comes through, the b/w cinematography is beautiful and the acting refreshingly non-campy.

Of the three versions I have seen of this great story, this film for me is by far the most well-done and the most faithful to the source material. It is too short perhaps though, and the ending seemed rather rushed. However the cinematography and editing still hold up very well, and the costumes, sets and effects are timeless. The script and story, with so many interesting ideas, are compelling and these ideas developed very well considering the length and the relatively fast pace(which I personally don't see as a problem). Alongside Dirty Harry, Invasion of the Body Snatchers is Don Siegel's best directed film, the music is atmospheric,there is genuine tension and suspense in the atmosphere which alone sets it apart from the other film versions, and the acting is fine for what it was, with Kevin McCarthy giving one of his more memorable performances. All in all, a sci-fi classic. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Attempt by Hollywood to smear a grand old U.S. party</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS was a thinly veiled plot to scare the American public into electing Adlai Stevenson to be their president in 1956. At the time, the U.S. had two major political factions (the Republican and the Democratic parties), and people who wanted to run for the top political job as U.S. president had to join one of them to have a realistic chance to win. Many members of the Democratic clique were shocked when WWII hero Gen. Dwight Eisenhower joined the Republicans and swept to the presidency in 1952. How could a respectable man wake up one day as a Republican, they wondered. Director Don Siegel took a pulp serial sci-fi story by Jack Finney, and gave his movie version of pod people all the characteristics of Republicans, as he perceived them: positions of power, such as police, politicians, and psychiatrists; affluence; a cold lack of emotions; and a driving desire to force everyone else to become just like them. It is amazing the censors of the day were too blind to nip this film in the bud. (Perhaps they were Democratic fellow travelers?)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Siegel's Classic But Subtle Science Fiction Chiller About Clone People</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No single movie more effectively captured the paranoia and depicted the conformity that afflicted America in the 1950s than director Don Siegel's low-budget, black &amp; white, science fiction chiller "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (1956) with Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter. Siegel remembered it as his favorite film and its potency lies in Siegel's subtle handling of the outlandish subject matter. Every Siegel film before and after "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" has examined the theme of the individual versus society. Never has any Siegel protagonist ever blended in with the swarm. Iconoclastic to the hilt, Siegel's protagonists clash with the status quo. Siegel's respect for these outcasts prompted him to make "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." "I think that the world is populated by pods," he observed, "and I wanted to show them." Despite its melodramatic title and ghoulish adversaries, "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" shares little similarity with sci-fi B-movies of the 1950s. Surprisingly, this minor Allied Artists release quickly acquired a reputation. Film critics and scholars alike have read considerably more into its standard narrative about aliens taking over the earth than Siegel intended. Kevin McCarthy said years later he saw "no political significance" in the plot. One of Don Siegel's contemporaries and a renowned film producer in his own right, Walter Mirish wrote about the film's significance in his autobiography. "People began to read meanings into pictures that were never intended. "The Invasion of the Body Snatchers" is an example of that. I remember reading a magazine article arguing that the picture was intended as an allegory about the communist infiltration of America. From personal knowledge, neither Walter Wanger nor Don Siegel, who directed it, nor Dan Mainwaring, who wrote the script nor the original author Jack Finney, nor myself saw it as anything other than a thriller, pure and simple." Nevertheless, good works of art are always prone to interpretations beyond those of its creators, and "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" became a lightning rod for commentary. Three schools of thought emerged about "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." The first construed it as a polemic against the hysteria-inducing tactics of discredited Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy who alleged Communists had infiltrated American government. McCarthy never substantiated his charges, but he forged an atmosphere of hatred and mistrust that ostracized iconoclasts. The second saw it as a metaphor for the perennial threat Communism posed to Americans. During the 1950s, the House Un-American Activities Committee launched a witch hunt and blacklisted many Hollywood filmmakers because of their involvement with the Communist Party between the 1930s and 1950s. As a casualty of the blacklist, "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" scenarist Daniel Mainwaring spent his remaining years writing under a pseudonym. A third school saw it as an indictment of the Levittown suburban mentality when everybody acted and dressed the same."Invasion of the Body Snatchers" opens with a prologue as the police transport Dr. Hill (Whit Bissell of "He Walks By Night") from the State Mental Hospital to see a delusional inmate who claims that he isn't insane. Dr. Hill sits down with our disheveled hero and listens to his story. Until the epilogue, when Siegel returns to the asylum, everything from here until then occurs in flashback as the story is told. Things begin innocently enough as a local physician, Dr. Miles Bennell (Kevin McCarthy of "Annapolis Story"), encounters patients in the small town of Santa Mira, California, who complain about their loved ones behaving like impostors. Town psychiatrist Dr. Dan Kaufman (Larry Gates) dismisses everything as "hysteria." Soon, Bennell and his old friend Jack Belicec (King Donovan) and his wife Teddy (Carolyn Jones of "The Addams Family") along with Bennell's former sweetheart Becky Driscoll (Dana Wynter), discover a replica of Jack in his house lying on his pool table. "It's like the first impression stamped on a coin," Jack observes to Bennell. Bennell takes the body's fingerprints, but it has no fingerprints at this point. The thing awakens no long afterward, and Jack and Teddy flee to Bennell's house with news that the body looks exactly like Jack. Later, they learn seed pods are appearing everywhere. When people fall asleep, the pods hatch facsimiles. Bennell breaks into Becky's house, finds a pod in her cellar, but rescues her before she can turn into a pod person. Our hero theorizes that so many things have been discovered in the world since the advent of the atomic bomb that radiation may have affected plant or animal life or some weird alien organism. Bennell sends Jack and Teddy out of town to alert the authorities. Eventually, the impostors take over and corner Bennell and Becky. They explain that the seed pods entered the Earth, landed at a farm and took root. Life has driven too many people over the edge and the pods will free mankind of its worries. Nobody will ever be troubled by anything again. "There is no need for love or emotion. Love, desire, ambition, faith?without them?life is so simple." Originally, "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" concluded with the frantic Bennell screaming his warning about these space aliens who robbed humans of their emotions and turned them into thoughtless automatons. Allied Artists sought to soften the hysteria. Siegel agreed against his wishes to add a prologue and an epilogue on the advice of Wanger for fear that the studio would re-edit the film.The legacy of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" is considerable. Philip Kaufman helmed an urban version of the Siegel film in 1978 with Donald Sutherland, but situated it in the urban sprawl of San Francisco. McCarthy reprised his role, and Siegel had a cameo. Later, independent director Abel Ferrara took it back to its rural roots in 1994 with "Body Snatchers" and located the action on a military base in Alabama. In 2007, another remake simply called "Invasion" appeared with Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. Originally, Jack Finney wrote the novel that "Collier's Magazine" serialized in 1954.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>in an early attempt to show McCarthyism, Invasion of the body snatchers fits it perfectly. the movie keeps you going, form first moment to last. The movie is possibly one of the best low budget movie i have ever seen. It was a sci-fi horror, that put in a little, but made a lot. The directing is tremendous, With its great scenery, and great acting, Kevin McCarthy shines, In the first film with his name on it. He has done other movies, but bodysnatchers is the only movie that is his. Though the film didn't win any awards and low budget doesn't mean it a bad movie The film has a lot going for it. Even to this day, a good 50 years,after the film has been made, it still continues to scare people. is on IMDb's top 100 list for the best science fiction film ( it ranks #38) This film is probably the best film in the 50's to be made. if you have to see any 50's movie, bodysnatchers is your best bet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rightly regarded as a classic, and perhaps best appreciated today minus the Studio-imposed prologue and ending, Don Siegel's study of a small-town overtaken by aliens reveals the paranoia at the heart of American society at the time. The fear which was sweeping through the country whipped up by McCarthyism meant that the idea of the untrustworthy neighbour who might be in fact a Godless communist had permeated public thinking to a deep level after the several years this process had been eating away at the body politic. The references in the script to the loss of "love" was a consequence of a belief that in totalitarian societies, the regimentation of existence quashed emotion. The idea that spies and agents were infiltrating America dedicated to its overthrow from within may seem somewhat amusing in retrospect: the spies that were active were usually after scientific information that the Soviet union needed to compete with the US in both the economic and military spheres. The sheer ridiculousness of a workers revolution being possible in such a conspicuously wealthy society seemed not to register at the time. This paranoia may well have been a hangover from the 30's when the system virtually collapsed and the idea of the worker's paradise had some appeal. The other current running through this work is the attendant concern about powerlessness in an era of scientific progress. The Bomb and its implications had started to percolate through society as well: did they have a two-edged sword? Siegel used a few touches of standard "noir" filming techniques to good effect as the realisation of their predicament dawns upon the Doctor and his paramour, and there is a reasonable frisson of sexuality between them in dialogue and intimate close-ups which helps us to view them as just people as opposed to an authority figure which the "doctor" so often is in film language of the time: ("trust me"). The scene where they discuss the body on the pool-table is an oddity, it stretches credulity, but perhaps martini-soaked bourgeois Americans of the time had a familiarity with corpses outside of our understanding. The effects are primitive by today's standards, but it was a small budget film, although one may even pick up a bit of Eisenstein's influence in the crowd scenes toward the end, which shows that Siegel was doing a lot with the small resources to hand. I always remember the scene where they hide under the boards at the mine as a beautiful piece of editing and composition, and it has more impact and tension than the rest of the subsequent night chase put together. As fresh as the day it was made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love this movie for all the wrong anachronistic reasons.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankly, I don't usually like to talk about "old movies". When I even hear someone use the term, I usually instantly brand them as teenage punks, with no real sense of temporality. Honestly, folks, the medium is still in its relative infancy when you look at it on a grand scale, and one of its great strenghts have always been, and probably will be for a while yet, its consciousness of its own youth. It gives it lightness, and allows it, as a format, a license to be inventive and fresh, to be frankly irresponsible, but in a good way. Additionally, I'm a historicist at heart, in the sense that I think everything should be judged on the merits of what it did and was when it was new, in the context of its own time, not from whatever completely arbitrary vantage point we happen to occupy in the "here and now". In any case, some movies can be enjoyed ahistorically, as they seemingly never grow older. Fellini's "La Dolce Vita" is as fresh today as it was in 1960, and Chaplin is as new to us as he ever was. Others, granted, don't age well, but let's not mention names. So, I don't like to talk about "old movies", but even so, today I will.This is because there are also those movies that were great in their own time that are still great today, but precisely because of the distance in time. Therefore, I will throw all my historicism overboard for the day, and say bluntly that it's great to watch "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" today, when it's soon about to celebrate its fiftieth birthday, precisely because it's in its middle age, because we can see it as a wonderful period piece from those good old days of the horrendously paranoid cold war, with the atomic bomb hanging over everyone's head and everyone going bonkers with all kinds of fear. Along with other gems like the original series of "The Twilight Zone", this is first class paranoid cold war comic fiction.I love this movie, and I will darn well allow myself to do so, with an ironic look at all the oddball pieces of strangeness that were probably never meant to be ironic, comic or even strange in 1956. Let's start listing some: the fact that the movie warns of the horrors of conformism, when all its characters by our standards are unbelievably conformist and conservative from the outset, with their perfect houses and perfect attitudes, their small-town-American lives, and their patriarchal gender roles (the ultra-masculine hero and the damsel in distress). The fact that it has a plot hole the size of the Albert Hall and demands to get away with it (already impossible by the time of the 1978 remake). Odd kinds of behaviour typical for movies of the time - "Why, there's a dead alien on our pool table. What to do? Of course - let's all have drinks!" The fact that the young handsome medical professional is a compulsive cigarette smoker. Concervativism, paranoia, alcoholism, nicotine addiction, a sexuality as straight and streamlined as the fold in your pants and the style of your hair, and a gosh-darn wholesome attitude to keep it all together. If that's not the Brave New World of Fifties America, I don't know what is.Yeah, there you have it, I like this movie for all the wrong anachronistic reasons. But then again, if I was around in 1956, I would probably have liked it then, too, if I hadn't been too busy being scared out of my wits by the horrors of communism, McCarthyism (who's to tell what's the worst? It's all the same as far as this movie is concerned) and the thought of having an atomic bomb land on my front lawn. Of course, in addition to that, I also love it for the very real suspense that ensures that your heart is in your mouth most of the time, and for its frankly surprising intelligence and wit. And for those wonderful double entendres, too.Go see it, or get the DVD. Bring your family. Bring your friends. Be prepared to have a ball, to be scared stiff, and to want to do it all again tomorrow, and probably in another fifty years as well, if we haven't come up with some new way to kill each other off for good by then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best! Anything that drums terror into your heart with such subtlety is superb in my opinion. This one had me thinking about it for days. There were no hideous, and as usually was the rule in those days, horribly mocked up space aliens and flying saucers to try to frighten you. These were real ordinary looking people! I also will repeat myself--no special effects whatsoever! There was only a prop or two, namely a seemingly harmless looking seed pod and/or a mannequin.The emotions displayed in this film by the main characters, namely Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter, played out with alarming clarity, almost melodramatic, but thankfully, it falls slightly short of that.This is scary. This is classy. This will give you the proverbial goosebumps. This will wrack your brain. Modern movie buffs might even welcome the mind games it provokes. It needs no bells and whistles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie as a child, and loved it. I have watched this movie more than a couple dozen times as an adult, and love it even more every time I watch it. This was the rare occasion in cinema history when everything came together and fit perfectly. The music score matched the mood perfectly. The camera angles and lighting were impeccable. And although there were no leading actors featured in this movie, each performer played his or her respective role perfectly. Kevin McCarthy was magnificent as Dr. Miles Bennel. Dana Wynter WAS Becky Driscol. King Donovan and Carolyn Jones were the icing on this celluloid cake. The commentary injected periodically throughout the movie, presented as the recollection of Doctor Bennel, adds a realistic psychological edge to this movie. And although the "monster' is not all that menacing (let's face it, seed pods just are not scary), it is the end result of the pods cause and effect that is utterly horrifying.SPOILERS BELOW - DO NOT READ ON IF YOU PLAN TO WATCH THIS MOVIE FOR THE FIRST TIME Many years after having seen the movie, I read the novel by Jack Finney. Although the novel had a few good twists that were not included in the 1956 movie, the ending of the original story was quite disappointing in my opinion. In the book, after Dr. Bennel starts a fire in a greenhouse where the pods are being grown, they all of a sudden just float off into space. Apparently, the good doctor Bennel singlehandedly thwarted the alien invasion.Of the two remakes, I find the one starring Gabriel Anwar the better of the two (sorry Donald and Jeff).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original story made more sense than this movie, but this is a big improvement over the remake, as most fomenters are. It's usually interpreted as a long analogy. The pod people are "communists" or sometimes "conformists" -- this being, 1956. But I expect that if you'd shown the movie in a theater in Hungary, the pod people would have been interpreted as "American imperialists" or "capitalists." Actually, they are the generic "other" -- the people we are not. It's impossible to be sure of the theme's origin but you probably don't have to go back much farther than Kenneth Arnold's sighting of "flying saucers" near Mount Ranier in 1947.The director, Don Siegal, doesn't show much flair. He never did. His strength was in telling a straightforward story and blocking out movements effectively in support of the narrative. There is one scene here in which he does something unusual with the camera and makes it work. When they hide in the cave, Miles and Becky curl up in a watery hole and draw a couple of boards over their hiding place. Siegal puts the camera under the boards when the pursuing hoard runs over them and we see multiple feet pounding just above the quarry's heads.The film is a classic of its kind, so to speak, despite the weaknesses in the plot. (Do you really need to fall asleep for the pods to take you over? And what happens to your first body when it's replaced? And why do the pods have to be somewhere near you in order for the transfer to take place -- or DO they, since Becky is transformed in the cave with not a pod in sight.) It's really enjoyable, a nicely crafted piece of work. Individual scenes make sense without any wasted time. If somebody is operating a barbecue and asks for a martini to pour on the fire to make it flame, it is pointed out that a martini is too watery to do the job, so some other accelerator must be gotten from the greenhouse, which leads to the next crisis. It's all as smooth as Pepto-Bismol.The music contributes a good deal to the movie's success. It's impossible to ignore it, and I don't mean that in a negative way. The acting is professional. Dana (pronounced "Donna") Wynters is beautiful, slender, and pure, especially in that white sweater of her. Kevin McCarthy, an Irish name avant la lettre, has a face and chin whose features define the word "chiseled." He's the brother of Mary McCarthy, the author ("The Group," "The Groves of Academe," etc.). Kevin used to pal around with Montgomery Clift before Clift became an abject drunk and started eating steaks off the floor.You really don't want to miss this one. It is low budget, yes, but quite good for what it tries to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scholarly Criticism: Communism and Invasion of the Body Snatchers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>---This comment is a scholarly criticism paper that I had to write for my high school film class. I deleted some paragraphs from the original paper to make it more readable for IMDb.--- The 1958 film, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, directed by Don Siegel, parallels issues and events that dominated the 1950s era. Coexistent with the release of this film was the Red Scare or Communist scare. The Red Scare surfaced after the U.S. victory in World War II, and altered the mindsets of the American people. The Republican Senator from Wisconsin, Joe McCarthy used the people's fear of communism as a tool to attain widespread popularity and support. As Miles accused people in Invasion of the Body Snatchers to be aliens, McCarthy accused many high ranking officials in the government and elitists of being Communists. Both of these character's accusations result in the spread of fear, havoc, and confusion. The spreading of the alien's power in Invasion of the Body Snatchers captures the fear that the American people had for communism in the early 1950s. Invasion of the Body Snatchers portrays the scenario where the influence of communism, represented by aliens in the film, spreads throughout the country and attempts to conquer it. Invasion of the Body Snatchers captures the mood and state of panic that existed during the Red Scare. At one point in the film, the spread of the aliens is referred to as, "an epidemic of mass hysteria." The situation in Invasion of the Body Snatchers portrays the nightmare of the American people in the 1950s. The rapid expansion of the alien power represents the spread of communism. The crisis of the alien invaders is even referred to in the film as, "the nightmare that threatened the world." In many ways Miles in Invasion of the Body Snatchers represents Senator Joe McCarthy in real world politics in the 1950s. Miles was acting on his own by the end of the film, attempting to reveal to the world that the aliens were taking over, just as McCarthy acted alone to expose Communists to the American people. However McCarthy and Miles have different motives for their actions. McCarthy's purpose for revealing his convictions of Communists in the government was fueled by self interest. Miles' purpose for revealing the threat of the alien invaders was fueled by the interest and overall well being of society as a whole. In this regard, Miles deserves much more respect, than senator McCarthy. The underlying theme of communism is implanted throughout Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The alien invaders come to represent the spread of communism in the 1950s. The aliens are invaders sharing the same purposes, as communism was a foreign concept in the 1950s greeted with much concern and worry. The fact that the alien invaders are equal in status and emotions, and hold a uniform opinion and purpose provides further connections to the institution of Communism, where all people are equal in status, and seek similar goals. Numerous scenes throughout the film exhibit characteristics of communism and the widespread panic of the Red Scare. In one scene Miles suspects the man at the gas station of being an alien invader, simply because the man opens his trunk. The paranoia exhibited by Miles emphasizes the paranoid questioning frame of mind that the Red Scare imposed upon people. This scene also emphasizes the connection between Miles and McCarthy. Miles immediately jumps to the conclusion, perhaps for good reason, that the man working on his car is an alien, as McCarthy immediately drew conclusions about government officials' and politicians' connection with communism.The tactics used by the alien invaders to hold and gain power are similar to the tactics exercised by the Communist regimes of the former Soviet Union and present-day China. Under Stalin, the Communist Government used many brutal programs and methods to eliminate opposition to the party. Eliminating threats to the Communist Party was seen as necessary, because in order for Communism to work in an ideal situation, all people must abide by its rules and ideals. For this reason the alien invaders search for the dissent, Miles and Becky. In this regard the alien invaders represent communism, because they endeavor to eliminate dissent to their group, as Communist leaders have in China and the former Soviet Union.Although at the time of Invasion of the Body Snatcher's release, the victor of the Cold War was unknown, the film's ending suggests that the opposition party to communism will succeed, and communism will fail. Invasion of the Body Snatchers suggests that democracy will triumph over communism, when at the end of the film, the police and population recognize the threat to society posed by the alien invaders. The film's ending which portrays democracy triumphing over communism has proved to be true in the real world as well. On the surface Invasion of the Body Snatchers appears to be an simple old-fashioned sci-fi film. While being an original sci-fi film, it is also a film that can be interpreted and connected to on many levels. The alien crisis in Invasion of the Body Snatchers illustrates the mass hysteria of the Red Scare. The alien invaders represent the wave of fear over communism in the 1950s. The power of the alien invaders in Invasion of the Body Snatchers ends at the conclusion of the film, as communism has fallen in the Soviet Union. Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a film of fictional plot, that can be applied and connected to real issues of the 1950s, primarily the Red Scare and the mass hysteria wreaked by the fear of Communism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS is the most impacting, terrifying, wonderful, and brilliant science fiction film of all the 1950s. Even surpassing THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL and IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE, INVASION is now on a hard-to-find DVD, but looking for it will be worth it. The height of sci-fi paranoia in the 50s, INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS is about a peaceful town in a little valley. One day a doctor and his girlfriend are on a date, until the someone calls the doctor for an emergency. (MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD).It turns out that it is a complete duplicate of him he found, but with no fingerprints. Soon, more horrific cases are discovered and it turns out that pods have fallen from another planet and are replacing the townsfolk one-by-one with emotionless duplicate aliens. A chilling and provocative classic perfect for night-time, INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS could sure give a lesson in film-making to aspiring directors nowadays, and is perfect for horror fans, classic lovers, sci-fi buffs, and others. The most unmissable film of that decade. Perfection.Grade: 10/10MPAA Rating: not ratedMy Rating: Ages 11 and up (terror)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a love story. It has nothing to do with Communism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The key to this story is the discussion between Dr. Bennell and Becky about love. Dr. Bennel uses the Biblical reference "hardening our hearts" in talking to Becky about what makes life worth living.Everybody is familiar with a spouse, sister, friend who is no longer loving. Becky and Dr. Bennell, who are in love, both agree that they wouldn't want to live in a world without love. But Dr. Bennell says that the ability to love disappears "a little bit" in all of us when we harden our hearts. (Everybody who is familiar with the New Testament knows this reference.) In other words, love is snatched from them unless they fight against not loving others.Nobody knows why it happens. In the movie, short story and book, Jack Finney comes up with a reason why love disappears--pods from outer space. That is why Becky is the only one who screams when a dog is almost hit in the town square of Santa Mira (actually Sierra Madre, CA). Becky (Dana Wynter) is perfect for this part because she is the embodiment of love. Back in the 1950s, many women existed like her, and loving men existed, too. Did the Body Snatchers win? The movie is shocking because we all know the horror of lost love.Interesting goofs: The doctor takes a sleeping Becky, dressed in bed clothes, from her bed and takes her to his house. When Becky wakes up the next morning at the doctor's house she is wearing tight jeans and a blouse, which are obviously hers.Another goof: At the doctor's house, Becky says she is going to boil two-minute eggs. She and the doctor are diverted to look at who is in the basement. Then Becky remembers the eggs and says they will be hard boiled. But the eggs have been in the water only about 20 seconds.Another goof: When filming headlights of a car which are lit, a film is placed over the lights so as not to blind the camera. When the doctor pulls into a used car lot to hide his car, he turns off the car's headlights, but the film covering the lights can be plainly seen.</fullReview>

Many imitations and remakes have followed over the years, but this classy, silvery black-and-white monster movie is the real goods, with a palpable sense of dread, confusion and paranoia. Don Siegel gives the proceedings a hard-hitting, no-nonsense direction (although the studio demanded a less-intense finale, hence the tag at the end). The voice-over by McCarthy gets in the way, but his performance is exactly right, and lovely Dana Wynter is also excellent as a love-interest. The production, scoring and effects are first-rate, making this one of the best entries in the 1950s horror genre. *** from ****</fullReview>

Bennell was screaming at the end about the fact that the aliens "communists" were already here among us and that they won't stop until they control all aspects of our lives. Liberals didn't appreciate this film because they knew exactly what this film was talking about and it really incensed them that their plot to takeover the planet was being exposed in such a simplistic manner.The good news is that the real threat of communist takeover has been subdued and is only relegated to communist China and other outposts of tyranny.It was great films like this one that brought to the limelight the reality that the communists had every intention of destroying our way of life and replacing it with their tyranny.</fullReview>

And I agree that this is problematic. But it doesn't ruin the movie, it's still a must see. The word paranoia is used a lot in describing Snatchers but from my perspective I saw no paranoia displayed or inferred.

After going through a litany of films of every genre and discussing other directors and their films, I found King to be not only very smart and interesting and really knowledgeable about film, radio, comic books and how he became a writer. The BEST part was near the end of the interview when the host asked him to pick his two favorite films of Sci Fi and Horror. King thought a few seconds and said it had to be the original INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS and mentioned the scene when Dana Wynter reveals herself to have been taken over and yells for the others to get Kevin McCarthy. He says it was the major influence in his life how scared he became as a young man and still sees it as a huge influence. The other was his choice for absolute worst, and it thrilled me, because I could never find anyone to agree.It was THE SHINING. He had said that Kubrick ruined his book and they disagreed about the ending which Stanley changed based on his own religious views.Nicholson's adlib "Here's Johnny! was a farce and King wrote was public about S.K.'s interpretation but commended him of the effects. I HATED THE SHINING which I saw at UCLA Westwood screening and the audience of 2500 plus, also joked,booed and threw things at the screen.King is not a favorite author but did like CARRIE and the great ending, which he attributes to Brian de Palma. Unlike a reviewer who found the actors McCarthy and Wynter wooden,King found it to be his favorite horror film which most influenced him. Finally, to ALL of you who equate the "meaning" of this film being based on fear of communism and McCarthyism, that is total CRAP! Don Siegel explained in one of his last interviews that it did not even enter his head of the writer's motive.It was to make the best film he could.

		<fullReview>I came to Invasion of the Body Snatchers backwards, this version at least. Liked Ferrara's version when I was younger (still do but not as much) and recently greatly enjoyed the 70's take but only saw this one about a week ago. In some cases this would be a far from ideal approach but actually the three films are distinct enough from each other to make different impressions, but most importantly stay fresh. The greatest difference between this one and later versions is in atmosphere. Effects came to the fore later on but here the inspired subversion of small town cosiness is the key. Santa Mira is a beautiful little place, smiling and neatly lawned small town America where everybody knows each other, everyone has a handle on each other's business and they all give friendly greeting. Though the creeps start from the beginning, even excluding the slightly ill advised(possibly studio imposed?) framing device, the sense of comforting place is layered on with just about every character. Some might call it stuffy but it works for me, an ideal breeding ground for the de-personalising alien usurpers of the title. Speaking of which, effects work is wisely underplayed here, we get pods, we get a taste of the birth of their spawn but no stand out effects work sequences, instead the tension is ratcheted up through more conventional thriller means, mounting paranoia and ultimate chase, all nicely handled by Don Siegel. Its very nicely tight stuff, early scenes weaving the strange and familiar with the familiar leaching away as things move on in a fashion controlled enough to feel gradual but in terms of actual film time impressive speed. Everything wraps up in around 80 minutes and towards the end its fine nerve racking stuff. I'm not sure how much of the discourse regarding the films allegorical status I buy into, the ideas that it deals with fear of Red infiltration or the opposing notion that the pod people represent the evil of McCarthy-ism, though this may just be my lax knowledge talking. If its content is intended towards deeper meaning its certainly subtle, though to be honest I find the basic concept more interesting (and terrifying) than any symbolism, the breakdown of the individual and triumph of the herd means more to me on psychological and philosophical terms than it does on social or political ones. In any case I found the film rather great, with my only problem that I found the characters a little dry, not so engaging, also some of the dialogue perhaps veered into the melodramatic. Not a big problem as the cast deal well with the material (Kevin McCarthy is a solid, sympathetic hero and Dana Wynter a bright and attractive love interest, with decent support all round) but it did slightly sick for me. Still muchly recommended though, 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sometimes paranoia's just having all the facts." ? William S BurroughsWe know the story: a doctor realises that strange pods are replacing people in a small Californian town with alien replicas. Nobody seems to notice, however, other than the friends and family members of the missing people. Cue an hour of paranoia, hysteria and lots of women screaming.In the late 50s, "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" quickly became a weapon for anti-communist campaigners, whilst others believed it to be either condemning or advocating McCarthyism (the act of accusing people of treason or communism without evidence). But the truth is, both the film's director (Don Siegel) and writer (Jack Finney) intended the film to be about conformity and the loss of free identities. "The majority of people in the world are pods," Siegel would say in interviews, "existing without any intellectual aspirations and incapable of love. I think the pods outnumber us, if indeed we ourselves are not the pods."A character in the film articulates these thoughts himself, saying: "I see how people have allowed their humanity to drain away?only it happens slowly instead of all at once. They don't seem to mind. All of us, a little bit. We harden our hearts?grow callous?only when we have to fight to stay human do we realise how precious it is."By continually attributing anti-communist readings to this film, audiences are thus doing the opposite of what it warns. For Siegel, there was no Other out there scheming to take your bodies, rather, we are all already - and want to be - the villains. The pods confirm to the popular image of a communist totalitarian state only because a government-dominated, bureaucratic and conformist post war America was itself busily creating a picture of Soviet Russia. This is the world of Nietzsche's Last Men, post war Americans seeking only security, conformity and the comfort of mediocrity. Siegel thus challenges this repression by advocating a kind of beleaguered individualism and personal defiance. It's a metaphysical battle between society and the individual, not a political one, the villains both all around us and within us, and not from "far across the sea". This world is long gone, however, which is why Siegel's film pales in comparison to Kaufman's 1978 remake. Kaufman's film sees the hopes of the flower power movement, and the rebels and oddballs of the 60s, crushed by a "pod invasion" that is global in scale, mankind evolving into a kind of homogeneous middle ground. Meanwhile, hippies and radicals morph into the materialistic yuppies of the 80s. The 2007 remake of this film, simply titled "Invasion" and starring Nicole Kidman, is even bleaker. Here, pod people have become the iPod generation, corporate power, saleable lifestyles, mass deindividuation and the commodification of "alternative lifestyles" blanketing the earth. Now, under multiculturalism/globalization/capitalism, "difference" is itself conformity. But, the film sarcastically argues, this is a good thing. A level playing field, a state of global equality, means less wars, less conflict, and a kind of comfortable middle ground satiated by mindless activities. Man thus becomes a kind of self excited organism, a pod person who works only hard enough to not get fired and is paid only enough to not quit, who lives in a state of mild indifference, punctuated by periods of dwindling passion. Nice.7.5/10 ? Howard Hawks' "The Thing", made six years earlier, has aged far better than this little horror flick. Similarly, Kaufman's 1978 remake offers more scares, more creepiness and is still quite relevant to contemporary audiences. Worth one viewing. Makes a good companion piece to "The Wanderers".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(There are Spoilers) Caming back home to Santa Mira from a medical convention in San Francisco Dr. Miles Bennell, Kevin McCarthy, is a bit taken by a number of people in town who are suffering from some kind of strange mass hysteria. They feel that members of their family and close friends are somehow not what they seem to be.Taking everything in stride at first even Dr. Bennell starts to notice that things aren't quite right when he's summoned to his friend Jack Belicec, King Donovan, home that evening together with his former girlfriend Becky Driscoll, Dana Wynter, who was out dinning with the doctor. Both Bennell and Becky are shocked to see, like Jack and his wife Teddy(Carolyn Jones) were, a stiff lying on the pool-table dead as a doornail with the stiff having amazing likeness to Jack! It later turned out that spores from outer space that turned into sea, or space, pods where landing in and around Santa Mira and where somehow duplicating the people in that town! It wasn't until later that it became apparent that these pods were not only taking over the bodies of the people of Santa Mira but after falling asleep were absorbing and taking over their minds as well!Well made science fiction thriller that has an invasion from space by aliens with intentions of taking over the human race without any of their victims knowing it until it's too late. Cutting off Santa Mira from the rest of the country the aliens, now the people who've been duplicated by the space pods, begin to ship the space pods out to all the towns in the vicinity. Soon like a malignant tumor they'll spread like wildfire infecting and taking over everyone, man woman and child, in America.Dr. Bennell and Becky the only two persons in Santa Mira not taken over by the pods makes a run for it out of town trying to get to the main highway to warn the people outside Santa Mira what's about to happen to them. Being chased by the mind controlled and duplicated Santa Miraiens and going without sleep for almost three days Becky passes out, or falls asleep, for just a second. In that brief period of time she's taken over by the alien pods and turns on her friend and lover Dr. Bennell and expose him and where he's hiding to them.With no sleep for days and being chased by the aliens Bennell makes it to the main highway and desperately tries to warn the speeding motorists just what's about to happen to them and is dismissed as a drunk and madman by everyone driving by. Jumping on a truck to get some rest Dr. Brennell sees to his shock and surprise that it's obviously from Santa Mira and loaded with sea pods! Completely losing it Dr. Berrnell is seen staggering on the highway eyes bulging out of his head and yelling at the top of his lungs that their, the aliens, "here already" as the movie draws to a close.I obviously left the enforced, by the studio, prologue and epilogue out like director Don Siegel wanted it to be. It was that action by Allied Artists that in insisting for a feel-good ending that almost sunk the movie. We already know by the prologue that Dr. Bennell survived whatever he was running from. We go into a long flashback with Dr. Bennell's narration to the point where he's on the crowded highway ducking cars and trucks and trying to get to the police FBI CIA US Army Navy Marines and Air Force for help.The contrived ending was just a bit too much. There's Dr. Bennell in the hospital about to be locked up in a padded cell only to be vindicated with the news that a truck, from Santa Mira, had overturned with a shipment of giant sea pods. That inserted into the film ending, which it's director Don Siegel was totally against, was about as corny and unbelievable as it can get and took away any tension and horror that was still left in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spooky and effectively narrated, this film has many thrills and chills, even when it is obvious what is happening. The way in which the scenes are photographed really enhances the experience, with a number of skewed angled shots providing a sense of something not being right. Made during the Cold War years, the anti-Communist undertones are interesting to pick up on, but regardless of propaganda messages, it still is relatively gripping. The acting is a bit mundane, and the film is overlong, for the premise is better suited to a short story than a feature length film. However, it definitely hits home on the realism front: everything presented is credible, and as a result, scary. With some lame lines of dialogue in the mix among a few other factors, the film does not quite transcend its B-grade production values. It does though do quite a good job considering, and it is difficult to argue the status that it has gained as a science fiction classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No stars,hardly 80 minutes,black and white,special effects kept to the minimum:and however,one of the most striking sci-fi movie you can think of.Don Siegel would make some of the modern directors blush,these directors who cannot do anything if there's not a ton of make-up and special effects to help them. An allegory,this story can be interpreted in different ways:some saw totalitarian system,and considering the era (the fifties ,when cold war was at his heights),they may be right. Fear does not stem from monsters or stuff like that,but from friendly faces that suddenly turn threatening.A kiss can scare you to death.It's the same world,but where smiles hide something definitely spooky.And Don Segel does not even allow himself a happy end.Perhaps the policemen at the end can do something,but perhaps it's too late,and anyway,are they really who they seemto be? Remakes were made,with stars,with color,with enhanced special effects.No one comes close to the pristine 1956 version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic film with a great moral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"We harden our hearts, grow callous. Only when we fight to stay human do we realize how precious it is to us, how dear..."I recently rented the DVD version of "Invasion" - what a treat! I hadn't seen this film in over twenty years, and was amazed that it was still able to send a cold chill down my spine just like it did when I first saw it on TV as a young child.This film is a definite classic. I'd even go so far as to delete a film or two off of the AFI100 list to make room for this one. "Invasion" seems to be the forerunner of the many excellent sci-fi/horror films which have come after it; "Alien" being one of the more modern examples.What is truly amazing is that there isn't the least bit of sex, violence, blood gore, swearing, etc.... all of which are part and parcel of today's horror films. Yet this B-movie, with it's cheesy special effects, works on a level similar to that of "The Blair Witch Project" -- it's not the gore on screen that's so scary, it's what you CAN'T see that is truly terrifying!!!The usual explanation for the symbolism of the "Body Snatchers" is its some sort of subliminal warning against the dangers of communism; however, I disagree with this interpretation of the film's message whole-heartedly. The Communist's conspiracy had absolutely nothing to do with making people into unfeeling blobs of flesh, quite the contrary-- they believed they could bring heaven to earth through a very flawed interpretation of economics and human nature. (All they've been able to accomplish, in reality, is to make earth even more of a living hell than it already is...) From the interviews I've seen, the director, writer, and actors have all denied that this film is some sort of parable of the Red Menace. Either they're all lying, or many people have missed the major point of this film. I tend to believe the later rather than the former.So what's the point of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers?" It's basically a morality play that deals with a much graver subject than 1950's politics, that subject being the gradual loss of one's "humanity."About midway through the film, as the two main characters are hiding out, Dr. Binnell says to Becky: "In my practice I've seen how people have allowed their humanity to drain away-- only it happens slowly instead of all at once." His point is that some people, through out the course of their lives, become quite hardened to the pain and suffering that seems so prevalent in this world. Whether it's from our own disappointments, or the enjoyment of the many blessings in our lives, we become callous to the suffering all around us, even to the point of denying it's existence. But as we become hardened to the pain and suffering, often we become hardened to love and happiness as well, as they are two sides of the same coin. While we might be able to fool other's into thinking we still have the same full set of emotions that we had at birth, yet in reality we use our fake emotions to hide the emptiness that's truly in our hearts. As in Pink Floyd's "The Wall" -- we build a wall around our emotional selves to protect us from the evil world that surrounds us. Believe it or not, "The Wall" and "The Invasion of the Body Snatchers" have the same premise at their core - the loss of one's "humanity" or "emotions" and the emptiness that results.This is a timeless message, and, in a way, may be even more timely now than ever before. Do you know why those two neo-nazi teenagers decided to go on a murderous rampage at Columbine High School? Then understand that point that this film and "The Wall" are making -- that there is a danger when one cuts himself off from the outside world, and it we only recognize it after the fact.Yes it's quite horrible having to face losing all your humanity in a single instant, but is not nearly so scary when the same process is carried out over a number of years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Artfully Crafted Little Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thanks to superb direction, acting, writing, choice of setting, etc., this low-budget film was transformed into a sci-fi classic. It's underlying motif is what powered this little 1956 B&amp;W spinechiller: that is, it played on one of our deepest fears - the fear of losing one's individual identity by being devoured by an inhuman force, whether it be an insect-society-political- ideology or an alien constitution devoid of emotion. The scene where the now alien(ated)town psychiatrist, Dr. Kauffman (Larry Gates) explains to the protagonists, Miles Bennel (Kevin McCarthy) and Becky Driscoll (Dana Wynter) that all they have to do is go to sleep and they will awaken as new creatures and will never again experience pain, hate, grief or other problems; whereas Bennel counters by saying that they would also never feel love or joy - puts it in a nutshell. The later scene where poor Becky unintentionally drifts off to sleep and undergoes an irreversible alien transformation is a terrifying shock to Miles as he kisses her; her formerly warm, pliant lips are now cold and unyielding. To add to the pain, she screams for the other aliens to come get Miles. The shock of incredulity rapidly gives way to cold reality as Miles runs, runs...runs for his life! Hats off to Director Don Siegel and crew!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good socialists like myself will feel uncomfortable with the film's anti-Communist subtext (though this may have been overplayed by some people). Apart from that, this is a tight, effective horror masterpiece, brilliantly exploiting its small-town setting, building a fine sinister atmosphere of paranoia and dread, and throwing in a few radical twists (such as the 'conversion' of Dana Wynter, still one of the most breathtakingly horrifying moments in cinema history). The tacked-on happy ending doesn't necessarily spoil the overall effect, either (and results in a more positive spin than Kauffman's 1978 remake). Siegel's track record as a director is patchy, but this is his finest hour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the pre-VCR days, I would watch the weekly movie listings to see when Invasion of the Body Snatchers was going to be on. This was a one in three year proposition. When movies became affordable, this was one of the first I purchased. I first saw it at the age of sixteen. I had had my driver's license for a week and my sister and I took the family car to a nearby town. This just happened to be the movie that was showing at the little theater. The sweat drenched face of Miles trying to convince people that the pods were everywhere. The tiring ordeal, trying to stay awake, not giving in to the inevitable. The transition from loving, sentient being, to the emotionless inhuman shell of Becky. Whenever I feel exhausted, I think of these two figures, heading for the highway, hoping to escape. Suddenly, I don't feel quite so tired. There are some of the greatest scenes of terror, none of them dependent on gore. The discovery that the seed pods are reproducing their bodies. The truck that the doctor jumps on the back of, only to find it is loaded with the pods. The horror of Miles not being believed after all his effort to escape. I think the most terrifying aspect of the whole thing is that the invasion is so calm. The aliens and their new troops just go about their business. While the central figures try to escape, the biggest threat is from the changing environment. Surely, there are adversaries in human form, but the real adversary is the end of life as we know it. Who is next? This movie is one that I compare all movies of suspense to. I'm not saying that it is Citizen Kane, but in its genre, it can scare the dickens out of you. I think I'll go watch this movie again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A quintessential example of paranoid 50's sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Invasion of the Body Snatchers, like so many sci-fi films of it's era can be seen as an analogy for many of the political fears of it's time. On the surface the film is about alien life-forms that take control of ordinary Americans turning them into soulless and characterless versions of their former selves. Under the surface the story could be read as a comment on the evils of communism taking hold of normal people and stripping them of their identity turning them into godless beings, who wish to undemocratically indoctrinate everyone into their way of thinking! The 50's fear of reds under the bed was exploited by alien invasion movies in particular and this one is certainly a prime example. Obviously, you don't need to understand the political climate of mid 1950's America to appreciate this film, it's just an interesting undercurrent and adds extra layers to proceedings.The film itself is a good example of its genre, and is handled well by director Don Siegel and has a strong performance from lead actor Kevin McCarthy. There are some impressive special effects used too in the scenes showing the plants giving birth to the humanoids. Perhaps even more importantly than this is the mood of paranoia that is sustained throughout, maintaining the mystery and unease until the very end. If I'm being honest I would have to admit to a preference for the 1978 remake. But that doesn't alter the fact that The Invasion of the Body Snatchers is among the best sci-fi/horror films of the 1950s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think we all know what this classic sci-fi movie is about, so I thought I'd take another approach here. I have quite a reputation for not welcoming many "modern remakes" these days, but there are a few updated retreads which I feel really improved upon the original idea. And that is definitely the case with the 1978 Donald Sutherland INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS being superior to the 1956 original. I think the '78 version - along with John Carpenter's 1982 redo of THE THING - are two of the best and superior remakes to older science fiction/horror films ever done. I always scoff at people (usually younger folks) who say they won't watch a movie that is in black &amp; white, or who don't like an older movie because it doesn't have great special effects. HOWEVER - when I watch the first 1956 version of BODY SNATCHERS I am consistently reminded of the better 1978 remake (which I saw first, don't ask me how!) and for the only time I can think of, I find myself in the shoes of a jaded kid today.This first Kevin McCarthy version here is good - in fact, it is a definite science fiction CLASSIC - but it's so tame by comparison with the 1978 film that I can't help but think that it is somewhat lacking. The story is good, the acting is fine, the threat is scary. But it's just too restricted and not as "of another world" as its remake. I do still enjoy the '56 film and think it's a solid one, but it always comes up short when I am reminded of the '78 movie. This in itself isn't really fair, since I generally try to approach any movie in the context of the time in which it was made. But I suppose there are sometimes exceptions, and for me this is one of them.One other thing that takes a little away from the original IMO is that all the "pod people" who are transformed do not seem "alien" enough. They tend to emote and carry on as if they were never changed at all. Look at the character of Uncle Ira early on, how he smiles and winks. The little boy later on is all giggles and laughs. These are supposed to be alien beings with NO emotions who you can tell are void of all feeling and humanity. This was a mistake that was rectified later on for the 1978 redo. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic 1950s sci-fi about an alien invasion of look-alike "pod people." A third remake is about to be released, but I doubt it will have the impact of the original. The 1950s version is justly celebrated for its moral ambiguity: do the pod people represent Communism or McCarthyism? Liberal and conservative critics have argued over this for decades. It seems every generation has its own version of the pod people, but only the Eisenhower era had two.(Doing another remake now makes a certain amount of sense: Bush's "you're either with us or against us" rhetoric sounds suspiciously McCarthyite. But as the polls indicate, his pernicious influence is waning. And Islamic extremism, although definitely a threat, is not of the same level or nature as global Communism.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don Siegel's Invasion of the Body Snatchers stands as one of the great unnerving science fiction stories in our cinematic history. Within the limits of the Production Code, IBS shows how terror can be created without much more than good acting, lighting, pacing, and music. Throw in a batch of green paint and paper mache and only the most CGI-addicted dingbats will not get the creeps from Jack Finney's story of humanity being murdered by alien flora.I've only seen the expanded version of the the movie, the one where Kevin McCarthy narrates the story and appears in a prologue and epilogue. For purists, this might sap the movie's strength, but I'd recommend the narrated version if you found Philip Kaufman's 1978 remake too relentlessly depressing. I've never seen the movie in widescreen, but, strangely enough, the version I have, taped from WTBS almost twenty years ago, is so closely cropped and glaring in contrast (you know--kine-scope?--the process of filming video tape comes to mind) that the movie's inherent paranoia and claustrophobia are amplified. Everyone's in close up and you start to feel the way McCarthy and Dana Wynter feel--there's no where to turn in their reality or within the confines of the TV screen.I always get a kick out of reading the IMDb reviews of this movie by those dingbats who can't figure out why Invasion of the Body Snatchers is considered so scary. I wonder if they're aware that fear is a human emotion, one that the pod people scorn.Sounds mighty suspicious.</fullReview>

However, he quickly forgets about it since his old boyhood belle is in town and he has some catching up to do... before THEY CATCH Up TO HIM!!! DUHDUHDUHHHH!!! Hahaha! Okay, anyways.This movie is really great, it honestly is. It's gripping enough anyways, but then there's the whole 50s-era communism phobia and just a little bit of risqueness from the lead, who is fantastic. However, it's all a little rushed.The great thing about this movie is how clearly it represents the life/unlife dichotomy and the real feeling that the characters have for wanting to be human and wanting to have emotion, but the difficulty is that it doesn't provide enough time to really accurately portray it all, especially considering the fact that the pods are capable of mimicking emotion enough that sometimes it's unclear whether or not a character is a pod... or just a bad actor...In general there's not quite enough distinctiveness and just when you think you've gotten a handle on where the story is getting ready to go, it plunges right in and soon zips through to the end. This does help the ideas somewhat in the fact that the transition from the regular community to the podpeople is alarmingly fast, which helps for its own kind of terror, but it also leaves open several plot holes which simply don't help any movie at all.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic And Influential Fifties Alien Invasion Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miles Bennel, the local doctor in the small Californian town of Santa Mira, notices an odd phenomenon - people reporting that their relatives are impostors. He then discovers a corpse with no face and some giant seed pods hatching into human forms. It transpires that an alien life-form is taking over the townsfolk when they sleep, germinating new bodies and taking control. Can Miles escape and warn the outside world ? Based on a brilliant Colliers magazine serial by Jack Finney and tightly scripted by Daniel Mainwaring (using the pseudonym Geoffrey Homes), this is one of the best science-fiction movies ever made and a terrific example of exciting, well-crafted, low-budget film-making. What makes it so good is the way it exploits the story thematically; not only is it a great yarn on a surface level (mystery, aliens, conspiracies, chases), but as an allegory it has all sorts of resonance (communism, paranoia run riot, parochial secrets, mistrust, government cover-ups). Despite its fantastic elements the story rings true dramatically - at some point we've all looked at our friends and neighbours in a strange light, unsure of their motives and allegiances. Siegel's direction is simply stunning, racking all of the tension out of the story as the hero stumbles into the nightmare, desperately trying to think straight, keep his bearings, trust no-one and stay awake. His use of photography is brilliant, often shooting upwards with extreme foreground lighting, making the audience feel small and exposed. Whilst earlier fifties sf movies (It Came From Outer Space, Invaders From Mars) had used the idea of the small-town takeover, the depiction of the community in this film is startling and unforgettable in its plausibility and frightening connotations. Despite a studio-imposed prologue and epilogue designed to reduce the impact, this is a smashing science-fiction/horror movie, and its influence on later films (particularly John Carpenter's They Live, and just about all of Joe Dante's work) can't be underestimated. Look out for Sam Peckinpah, playing a meter-man.</fullReview>

I daresay, it's underlying context, of human souls being replaced by bodies void of emotion, and instead supplanted by the pretext of it, is more poignent today. One need only watch this film as an early warning sign of modern narcissistic glorification of all things quick, plastic, and "pretty" to appreciate "Invasion of the Body Snatchers."If you choose to NOT look for allusions and metaphors in this film, by all means, DON'T. It's still one of the scariest films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, odd, original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that I did like this film, just not as much as most people apparently did. If it was a political or religious allegory, then that has flown right past me. I didn't see it in there. It had an original plot line, good photography for a black-and-white California movie, and good direction, inasmuch as I never once noticed or thought about the director. The acting was good, everyone playing it totally straight, so that there was never any campiness whatsoever. I was pretty impressed with Dana Wynter, with whom I am unfamiliar. According to IMDb, she was largely a TV and stage actress, more than a movie star. I suppose everyone should see this for its historical value, but I think you have to like sci-fi to some extent, or you won't like it much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An anti-communist screed? An anti-McCarthy (Joe, not Kevin) screed? Just a plain old alien invasion movie? Whatever it was saying, "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" remains a formidable part of cinema history, mainly because it deals with the issue of not knowing whom you can trust. An interesting aspect is that Kevin McCarthy later semi-spoofed his role here in Joe Dante's B-movie homage "Matinee": McCarthy played a general in the movie-within-the-movie.But anyway, this is a really impressive piece of work. Just try and see whether or not you trust every last person after watching "IOTBS". Because remember: You're next! Also starring Dana Wynter, King Donovan, Carolyn Jones (Morticia on "The Addams Family") and Richard Deacon (Cooley on "The Dick Van Dyke Show").</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Science Fiction with an impact!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with "The Thing from another World" this Don Siegel film is the most essential 50's SF movie and perhaps one of the most copied tales ever. Invasion of the Body Snatchers already received two remakes and there are tons of other films that refer towards the apocalyptic premise of the film. And yes, this movie deserves all the credit it can get! The simple and straight-to-the-point screenplay adapted from the classic Jack Finney novel is terrifically filmed by Don Siegel and splendidly acted by Kevin McCarthy. The ideal setting of a small American town (called Santa Mira) gives an extra impact to the desperation and the images of mass hysteria. McCarthy stars as the town's doctor who discovers that the inhabitants are slowly taken over by a strange alien life form. While people are asleep, exact emotionless pod-copies of them are produced. Don Siegel shows his talents in directing and he doesn't allow the low budget to limit him. Invasion of the Body Snatchers features a fairly reasonable amount of action, intelligence and tension and?.maybe THE greatest ending ever filmed! Almost 50 years old and still one of the only movies that disturbs me (and I'm sure many viewers with me) with its uncanny black &amp; white cinematography and hopeless theme. The 1978 remake by Phillip Kaufman unquestionably is a more detailed and involving movie that gives a much more intense portrayal of the soulless pod-people. Since that version also had a much wider budget, the horror effects are more frightening and realistic. Opposed to that is the fact that this 50's version makes excellent use of the isolation element. I really couldn't say which version is superior. Both are must-sees and not one horror and/or science-fiction lover can afford him/herself to miss them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love how some propagandize how "McCarthyism" has been discredited. To that extent, I saw letters to the editor DENYING that card-carrying Communists infiltrated the U.S government. I had to remind these dolts / leftists that the Rosenbergs were Communist spies, so was Alger Hiss, who was on Roosevelt's advisory team at Yalta (we gave away a sector of Berlin and the entire eastern European block on that one). So was Whittaker Chambers, a high-ranking U.S. Official and contact of Hiss, who happened to infiltrate the top echelon of the government. Joe McCarthy put these subversives on the run, to the dismay of many in Hollywood. This gutsy film depicts the hypocrisy and double-standard of people who have a hidden agenda of hatred and internal destruction - same as we see in this country today, except they are bolder now, and more outspoken. This film is a real public service and could not be made today in the leftist quagmire / sleaze of the times. The film far transcends its "science fiction" smokescreen, so that multiple viewings are required to discern and fully appreciate its subtle, yet stark message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A boring, cheesy movie with a great premise that doesn't deliver</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, maybe I'm being a bit hard on this movie as it is from the 1950's, but still. The main character, a doctor, could have been played by a block of wood, with the same level of emotions and depth. This movie is about pods that replicate humans without emotion in order to take over. This movie was remade as The Invasion recently. Anyways, back to the 50's. The premise sounds good, but it actually isn't, seems these pods can just take the form of people and when you sleep, they just suck your mind out. Wait, What!!! ridiculous, and then you are possessed and they burn the replica, convenient. The doctor and his friends and girlfriend attempt to solve the mystery of why people are acting funny in town, and overacted performances are everywhere. Women screaming, and a voice over that makes it seem like some sort of film noir. A love interest between the doc and his girl is a secondary plot line, giving the director an excuse to throw millions of horribly cheesy lines at us again and again. These lines are grimace inducing, you could make nachos out of them, lots of nachos. And according to the trivia on this website, they had to add on the alternate ending. I for one think that is a good thing because otherwise, you would have some open ended thing like some terrible modern movie like children of men.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One major flaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a pretty good movie, that could've been an excellent movie. It is marred by some minor plot problems and one gigantic plot flaw.The minor plot points are a number of cases where the course of action the characters choose makes little sense. Such as when the hysterical little boy visits the doctor's office. The doctor barely looks at him, doesn't talk to him at all, and instantly prescribes some kind of medication and sends him home! Huh?? Or when Our Hero, having committed breaking-and-entering based on a hunch (huh?) now goes upstairs and finds his girlfriend, who does not respond to his attempts to wake her. He's a *doctor*. Does he try harder to wake her? Examine her at all? Take a pulse? Look in her eyes? *Anything*? No, he is completely unruffled by her physical lack of response and just picks her up and carries her out. Huh? Later, the police catch Our Hero in the basement where he has committed the crime of breaking and entering. Do they arrest him and lock him up? No, apparently doctors are just allowed to break into people's basements (damaging properly along the way) in that town. Huh??? There are an awful lot of things like this in this movie.Now, granted, most of them, while flaws, aren't crucial the story; with better writing, they could've been smoothed over, and the same tale told. But one plot problem is just egregious and unforgivable, and it seriously, seriously marred the movie for me. Without this screwup, I might've given the film an 8. And it is this:The premise of the film is that these alien pods grow duplicates of people. When the pod is sufficiently grown, it sucks the mind and memories out of its target, while the victim sleeps. It then somehow disposes of the victim's body and takes the victim's place in the world. OK, fine. But so what happens with the heroine? She, the original human, runs away with the hero, until he leaves her alone in the cave for all of three minutes. When he returns, she has become one of the pod-people, because she fell asleep. What?!?!? The premise is that the plant-grown pod replaces you, not that the original human's mind is altered! This just makes NO sense. Her pod-duplicate was somewhere back in town, certainly not in the cave! And even if there had somehow been a new, blank pod in the cave, there hadn't been enough time for it to fully duplicate her. I'm sorry, this was just DUMB, and significantly marred the film for me. Suspension of disbelief requires that you establish a premise, *and then stick to it*.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing the liked 1978 Donald Sutherland remake before this, but this original from director Don Siegel (Dirty Harry, The Shootist) is more critically acclaimed. Basically Dr. Miles J. Bennell (Kevin McCarthy) has returned to his small Californian town, being held by the police as a raving lunatic, and he starts telling the story of how he got this way. So the flashback begins, where he is working at his hospital normally, many patients cancelling their appointments, but those close to the patients are acting as though they have been replaced. More reports come in of people being replaced, and he concludes it is some kind of mass hysteria, but slowly he is believing this conspiracy. His friends Jack (King Donovan) and Theodora 'Teddy' Belicec (Carolyn Jones) show him a partly formed body uncovered in their home, forming in alien pods amongst plant life, he even sees himself. He and Becky Driscoll (Dana Wynter) know that these alien "dopplegängers" are all over the place, and must be stopped, and obviously when he is on his own that is when he is caught by police acting madly. Also starring Larry Gates as Dr. Dan 'Danny' Kauffman, Jean Willes as Nurse Sally Withers, Ralph Dumke as Police Chief Nick Grivett and Virginia Christine as Wilma Lentz. The film is seen as a metaphor for a paranoid 1950s America, and with some very good (for the time) special effects, it is a well put together nightmarish classic science-fiction thriller. It was number 47 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, and it was number 47 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another one of those low-budget 50's sci-fi movies that can be read as an allegory for cold war Communist paranoia. There's not much to say about this movie; it didn't inspire much feeling in me one way or the other. Alien pods mysteriously appear on earth, and the sticky beings that ooze their way out of them take over the appearance and minds of earthlings (but can only do so when said earthlings are asleep--go figure). Maybe I missed something, but I don't understand what happens to the people whose appearance and minds the pod people take over--shouldn't there be two of everyone walking around by this logic? But best to leave logic at the door. At a brisk 80 minutes, this movie breezes by quickly enough, and manages to generate a small--albeit very small--level of suspense, but if you're expecting the sci-fi classic everyone has led you to expect, you might be disappointed.Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once in a while Hollywood produces a movie that decades later gets adopted by American industrialized secondary education. That's because teachers confuse various notions of ideas and think that movies are a great teaching tool. So to teach the evils of communism, show "1984." War? "Private Ryan." And on and on including all sorts of filmed literature.But no film has been so abused as this one. For our international readers, the American political identity for decades was defined as anti-communism. In many cases that led to responses that seem ridiculous in hindsight, including a public trampling of civil rights by a zealous senator. This is important history, all of it and worth understanding.Now along comes this taught little film about possession. It wasn't designed as an allegory, but was quickly adopted. Since then, we have legions of schoolkids ? and not a few critics ? armed with three buzzwords (paranoia, communism and McCarthyism) diligently watching this and writing essays. But just take a look at the mechanics of what is happening: there is no paranoia because the threat is real; there is no brainwashing or convincing; there isn't even a conspiracy in a normal (meaning social) sense. The allegory just doesn't fit and why it persists is as interesting a story as what is purportedly allegorized.You have to understand where this came from.The biggest revolution in film at the time this was made was the notion of "noir." The basic idea is an ordinary Joe (often including his girl) is caught up in a world of fate whose underlying laws are different, don't quite make sense, and seem to be capriciously toying with him. Certain cinematographic conventions often accompanied this (darkness, high contrast, dutch angles, voice-over narrative, high caricature) which have been mistaken for what it is.Noir completely turned film-making and film watching around because it could toy with the differences between the world of the viewer and the world of the movie. One main thread of this toying dealt with the already entrenched notion of what I call "folding," the idea that the story somehow references the fact that it exists in a movie. Often this is subliminal, sometimes explicit but usually in between as here.Just as side comment on genre: the fifties had a rather well understood notion of science fiction. It relied on _science_, usually by taking some known scientific principle (just one usually) and extrapolating into the future. In many cases, there were in-your-face moralistic allegories. "Star Trek" is an example of 50s science fiction. Today, science plays little part in what is called science fiction, especially in films. When this movie came out, I was already a pulp science fiction reader. No one in its era would have thought of it as science fiction. Yes, it references aliens (by a psychiatrist no less) but it rather was considered noir thriller/horror because it has no science. Compare this to "Forbidden Planet" of the same year to see what I mean.That "noir" part was because what we see are actors. We know they are actors, who have actorly behavior. What do actors do? They inhabit the "bodies" of characters. In a "Purple Rose of Cairo" twist, here we have the characters that actors play worried that another level of actors (passionless actors no less) will take over their bodies when they are not acting (that is, when they are asleep). It is a far more sophisticated thing going on. We worry as viewers because when this sort of layer shuffling happens, we get confused about whether we are in the world of our theater- bound butt or the world that we see on screen. This same confusion, incidentally, gives an opening for other sorts of confusions like the one about communism.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

Perhaps I'm just a genre-biased babe, but it seemedterribly obvious and completely lacking in suspense. There aremovies, such as the Invisible Man, that were equally banal, butI found somehow compelling. Perhaps this is because after seeingGods and Monsters I felt like I was having a good laugh with thedirector. For instance when the first pod person shows up in the doctor'sfriend's garden, and the doc's advice is to spend the night withit in the same room with it and see if anything happens... What,is he nuts?But perhaps I am jaded by living at a time when the pod personconcept has become so much a part of the cultural mythology thatthere are no surprises left for me. Will, for instance, theSixth Sense (imho, a reasonably suspenseful movie) seem insanelybanal to the viewers of the future?The biggest irony of all is that the period of time looks, tothe contemporary viewer, like a parody of uberconformity.

I have heard some film experts analyze this movie and say that the whole conspiracy aspect of this film is a metaphor for the fears of Communism in this era.

		<fullReview>I hope I don't upset many people here but I don't think this film really deserves its all time 50s SF classic crown . I think FORBIDDEN PLANET is the greatest SF film from the 50s and that the 1978 remake is a far better film. Why didn't I like the original ? Well let's say I didn't dislike it , it did have some good scenes in it like when the possessed town's people all slowly converge in the town centre , but what spoiled the film was the fact that the aliens were so rational as to be almost benign . Their talk of no more pain or fear or hate made me wonder why the hero didn't want to join them ( Compare this to the remake where the possessed humans are instantly cold and unlikeable . No wonder they're led by Mister Spock ) , and their constant talk about an equal world makes me wonder how some critics can claim this is a film allegory on Mcarthyism , the aliens are patently pinko commies . Maybe this version is so popular because it has a right wing conservative agenda ? Check the upbeat ending where we're almost told to " Watch the skies - the commies are coming " . The bottom line is INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS is a good enough film , but it's not the all time best from the golden age of Sci Fi cinema</fullReview>

Why, just to survive?(Possible spoiler) It is plodding and slow. Once you figure out the idea behind the pods, which is early in the film, it is rather over, one waits and hopes for a climatic ending, instead we are left standing in wonder. I am sure this is on purpose, we keep wondering, will it end? Will humans win? Will xxx'ism take over the world.

		<shortDescription>Carries Serious Message, but Appropriately Remains in B-Grade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an evolved version of the 50s drive-in monster cinema, Invasion of the Body Snatchers presents the anxiety for nuclear energy and the vulnerability of human existence with more serious outlook, but only on its surface. Unfortunately but maybe appropriately, the low production value makes the film remain in the B-grade. It may have many film fans neglect the filmmakers' serious thoughts; at the same time, it must have helped the film to be a cult favorite.Simply, the story is not compelling. It takes too long to get to the point and the suspense is not built enough. Due to the lack of character development, a "snatched" person's supposedly philosophical statement, which is that life would be easier without human emotions such as love, ambition, and faith, sounds empty. The little character development also reduces the shock value at the moment that the protagonist's girlfriend is "snatched" and loses her identity along with the love for him.</fullReview>
