		<fullReview>Okay, the 1956 original paved the way and has to get the credit for that, but from an objective point-of-view, both the 1978 and this 1993 remake are better, scarier, more developed. In comparison to the second version, this one has a nowhere nearly as brilliant, rather disappointing ending, but the pacing is must faster. Abel Ferrara keeps the movie running for only a tight 85 minutes, and pushes all the right buttons along the way; the horror ranges from the gory (the melting heads) to the supremely subtle (the scene in the classroom, where all the kids draw the exact same picture, except for one, who naturally realizes that something is wrong - the teacher seems to want to punish him for being different). This is a spine-chilling, absolutely terrific little picture - but even if it wasn't, it would still be worth seeing just for Meg Tilly's exceptional performance - her "where are you gonna go?" monologue is as scary as anything in say, "Psycho" or "Rosemary's Baby".

		<shortDescription>Good ? but not in the same way as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Malone family move to a military base to help contain a toxic spill. Many of the soldiers and families are behaving strangely but is it the toxins or something more sinister?I'm not a fan of remakes, many try to just copy the success of other films while some lift the original scene for scene to poor effect. However this at least tries to do something slightly different with it by setting it in a military base and bringing the drama into the family setting. In fact this setting creates some of the best scenes ? my favourite being where Carol tells her daughter Marti that `there's no one like you left'. The greater effects are good but really I preferred the paranoid tension of the 50's original rather than the horror of effects.However I still think this is a very workable horror from a good director. Of course it suffers with comparison with the original ? that's because the original is a sci-fi classic. But as it's own film it is pretty good. Indeed the ending is what director Siegel intended ? but he was forced into having a more hopeful epilogue ending. Naturally it has it's weaknesses ? the effects overpower the story at times but really I found this to be enjoyable as a horror.The cast are one of the weak links. I love Kinney because I'm a big Oz (HBO) fan, but here he doesn't really make a mark. Tilly has all the good lines and she is actually quite good. Anwar is also very watchable. But Ermey is type cast in his usual military role and Whitaker is far too calm and reasoned to do the job ? he needed to be more like McCarthy in the original.Overall, this should be watched and not compared. In it's own right it is a good horror with only a few weaknesses that spoil it slightly. And if you do want to compare it to the 50's version then please remember than this is the type of ending that Siegel wanted and to me is one of the strengths of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aliens take control of everything...even your body and soul !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally, I try never to watch any remakes before I had the chance to see the originals...So, watching this movie really was an exception for me since I never saw Don Siegel's version from 1956 and neither did I had the chance so far to catch the Philip Kaufman remake from 1978 starring Donald Sutherland. But this movie came on TV the other night and I watched it anyway. Besides, there were a few very interesting and respected people involved in this production. First of all, there's director Abel Ferrara of course. He already delivered a few true masterpieces before and some of them are personal favorites of mine ( like Driller Killer, Bad Lieutenant and The Addiction ). But I wasn't completely convinced about watching this movie before I noticed that both Larry Cohen and Stuart Gordon took part in writing the screenplay. All three are very talented and influential men in the field of horror and I figured a collaboration between the three of them could only lead to something good. Well, it certainly is a decent movie and it provides the viewers with several scares. But - in general - I have to admit that I expected a bit more of it. The whole movie looks "unfinished" from time to time and the basic plot-idea isn't explained well enough, I think. I also had the feeling that everything moved too quick...Body Snatchers only lasts 87 minutes and that's a bit short for a rather complicated story like this. I would have preferred it to be a little longer and more detailed. Because of the fast storytelling, the ending also looks really fake and too abrupt. That was my biggest disappointment about it, I guess. Nevertheless, Body Snatchers contains multiple memorable scenes and it actually has the ability to raise the hair on your arms...That's quite an achievement too, I may say. Especially the sequence where both the daughter ( an adorable Gabrielle Anwar ) and the father ( a terribly boring Terry Kinney ) are being "body-snatched" is really frightening and a beautiful example of suspense-cinema and building up a tight atmosphere. This terrific scene ends with a powerful monologue by Meg Tilly's character. The entire movie is in fact recommended if it were only for this scene !! The further cast of Body Snatchers also contains a washed up Beverly Hills star ( whose name I don't remember ) and very enjoyable little roles by first class actors like Forest Whitaker and R. Lee Ermey. I guess this last one is doomed to play the authority figure ever since his outstanding performance in Full Metal Jacket but what the heck. He's brilliant every single time. In conclusion, Body Snatchers contains a few very bloody and explicit sequences so horror fans won't be disappointed completely. It could have been a lot better, that's a fact. But on the other hand..it could have been a lot worse as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They Get You When You Sleep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The teenager Marti Malone (Gabrielle Anwar) is traveling along her summer vacations with her father, the EPA inspector Steve Malone (Terry Kinney), her stepmother Carol Malone (Meg Tilly) and her young stepbrother Andy (Reilly Murphy) to a military base where her father will inspect some toxic products. In a gas station bathroom on the road, she is scared by a soldier that advises her to not sleep, because they get you when you sleep. Once in the base, she becomes friend of Jean Platt (Christine Elise), the daughter of the general in charge of the base, and the helicopter pilot Tim Young (Billy Wirth). Marti and her father see that people are acting strange, and sooner they find that aliens are cloning the human beings in the base and invading Earth.Abel Ferrara's remake of Don Siegel's 1956 "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" is more violent than the original movie, but is also very good. There are three particular moments that I like very much: the first one is certainly when Marti throws Andy from the helicopter. I believe very few directors would have the courage to make such scene. The second one is the scary screams of Carol and Jean later. Last but not the least is the scene in the hospital when Gabrielle Anwar is naked and partially shows her breast. Although the end of this version is happier than the original one, it is open with the helicopter landing and Carol's voice saying "Where you gonna go? Where you gonna run? Where you gonna hide? Nowhere, cause there's no one like you left." And then, "THE END" is highlighted with uppercases, probably meaning that Marti and Tim would be the last human beings on Earth. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Invasores de Corpos ? A Invas?o Continua" ("Bodies' Invaders ? The Invasion Continues")Note: On 05 July 2015, I saw this movie again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat Unnecessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone knows the plot of THE INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS because they`d already been two adaptations before the 1993 remake . The same basic plot had also been done in the 1955 television serial QUATERMASS 2 which was also remade by Hammer films in the late 1950s and we`ve seen DOCTOR WHO stories like Spearhead From Space that uses a very similar premise . In short the idea had been done to death by the 1990s On its own BODY SNATCHERS isn`t a terrible film , it is moody and dark as it should be , but it does have a rather mechanical script with a scene featuring some teen angst followed by a mysterious scene followed by a scene featuring teen angst followed by a mysterious scene followed by a scene featuring teen angst . Everyone knows that the plot revolves around alien infiltration so do the audience get to find out why the aliens come to Earth ? Not really , unlike the 50s original there`s no real ambiguity as to the aliens motive or subtext either . I should also point out that aliens taking over military bases makes perfect logical sense if they want to nullify humanity but unfortunately setting the story on a military base where through necessity human individuality is disallowed and where the newly introduced protagonists don`t know the other characters means we have a story that lacks compelling and terrifying drama . We find it somewhat difficult to care about the people involved because they lack individuality to begin with .As I said it`s by no means terrible but BODY SNATCHERS fails alongside the 1978 version which I rate as the greatest paranoid thriller ever made</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Third version about a creepy story in which the nightmare that threatens the world takes place in a military base</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Acceptable Sci-Fi picture which achieved a moderated success on its appearance and dealing with a teenage girl and her father discover alien clones are replacing humans on a remote U.S. military base in Alabama . This is a passable rendition starred by a good cast such as Forest Whitaker , Meg Tilly, Terry Kinney and Gabriella Anwar . It is an average budget version , though sometimes slow-paced and including some jolts of horror . Science Fiction , military and fantasy is presented in its most horrifying form . A genuinely frightening , chilling exercise in nightmare dislocation in which hideous creatures from outer space arrive on Earth with plans of conquest by means of pods and being freely based upon a novel by Jack Finney . There are not monsters only the residents of a military headquarter , as their wills , minds and bodies taken over by a weird form of life from outer space . This is the third adaptation , still very scary and creepy about a vintage novel deals with some military residents who are being replaced by duplicates hatched from weird pods . It creates an altering the human behaviour in the new invaders . As a doctor (Terry Kinney) must protect his daughter (significant role for gorgeous Gabriella Anwar) and her new stepmother (Meg Tilly), and soon aware that pods from outer space are duplicating and menacing everyone there . Meantime , the teenager daughter befriends a handsome attack helicopter pilot, Tim Young (Billy Wirth) and a young girl named Jenn Platt (Christine Elise) , daughter of headquarter commander (Lee Ermey). The doctor may hold the means to avoid the extraterrestrial invasion as he discovers their friends are being taking over by cold human-duplicates , as one by one are turned into aliens . While examining specimen, Doctor Malone is approached by angst-ridden Major Collins (Forrest Whitaker), who asks him about psychological effects particularly narcophobia . The mysterious epidemic from outer space is spread along military camp , everybody are being taken over by emotionless , cold behaving beings . The strange seeds from outer space are growing and destroying a little base at an alarming attack.This scary Sci-Fi displays a tense screenplay freely based on Jack Finney novel titled ¨Body snatchers¨ that can be considered truly disturbing . Packs eerie suspense , chills , thrills , spectacular scenes , chilly events and pretty turns and twists . A ceaselessly inventive , ghastly rendition of the alien take-over paradigm , including a a nice built-in paranoia about a small military base is infiltrated by pods from outer space that replace and replicate human beings . It profits from an intense acting by Terry Kenney , Forrest Whitaker , R. Lee Ermey along with an enjoyable Gabrielle Anwar ; furthermore , a right direction by Abel Ferrra who proved himself master of the eerie clutch at the base of one's spine . Appropriately exciting and frightening musical score by Joe Delia , though composed by means of synthesizer. Atmospheric cinematography and evocatively eerie ambient by cameraman Bazzeli , this was the first film shot with Arriscope anamorphic lenses, which were created for Arri by the German manufacturer Isco-Optic. Adequate production design and considerable visual and special effects . The motion picture was professionally directed by Abel Ferrara . Director Ferrara brought an entirely new approach to the Sci-Fi field to a well known story that has been shot various times . He filmed an attractive tale and it has emerged as an acceptable Sci-Fi thriller that brings astonishing nightmares . Lovers of the thriller/chiller should no miss this considerable Sci-Fi , everybody will have fun being scared by this expertly crafted film . Other versions about this known story are the following : a post-McCarthy paranoid fantasy epic titled ¨Invasion of the body snatchers¨ (1958), stunning and frightening adaptation which emerged as a cinema classic which achieved tremendous and unexpected success on its appearance , so well tuned for the times that some saw it a parable Communist Witch Hunts ; being compellingly directed by Donald Siegel with Kevin MacCarthy , Dana Wynter , Larry Gates , Carolyn Jones , and Sam Peckinpah ; 1978 new version also titled ¨Invasion of the Body Snatchers¨ , one of few instances where a remake is an improvement on the original , directed by Philip Kauffman with Donald Sutherland , Brooke Adams and features cameos by Don Siegel and Kevin McCarthy from the original , realized with great originality in spite of being a remake concerning again about mysterious seeds duplicating people . Lately recent version that results to be the least satisfactory and yet another inferior titled ¨Invasion¨ with Daniel Craig, Nicole Kidman , Jeffrey Wright and directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel , this so-so take on , it takes advantage of the advances in FX , sound technology and some interesting visual effects .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this remake of a classic, they used Bad Lieutenant and King of New York director Abel Ferrara, and cast the young beauty Gabrielle Anwar (The Librarian: Return to King Solomon's Mines) and "thirthsomething" Terry Kinney in the leads.Kinney went on to do The Laramie Project later and was fantastic. If you want conformity, then setting your movie on a military installation ensures that you have an easier time of it. Younger people will love this version, but just updating to modern techniques and special effects doesn't always make for a better picture.

		<shortDescription>Arguably the best of the four</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Body Snatchers" is the fourth in the quasi-franchise based on Jack Finney's 1955 novel "The Body Snatchers" about an alien invasion where people die and their bodies become pod-versions of their former selves. The entries in the series are as follows: - "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (1956) - "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (1978) - "Body Snatchers" (1993) - "The Invasion" (2007) The first one is in Black &amp; White and is probably too dated and tame for most modern viewers, but it's still worthwhile; it takes place in small town, California. The 1978 sequel switches the setting to the big city of San Francisco. This 1993 sequel switches to an army base in the deep south. And the 2007 version switches back to the big city of Washington DC. I suppose they could all be viewed as progressive steps in the invasion, particularly the first three; I say this because the 2007 entry changes some aspects and might be better viewed as a variation on the story rather than a sequel.I think this 1993 entry is the best, followed by the original, and then the 1978 and 2007 installments. What I like about "Body Snatchers" is the cast and the setting. The Army base naturally makes it easier for the alien imitations to go undetected as they spread through the community.Although she was 22 during filming, Gabrielle Anwar plays the 17 year-old protagonist, the daughter of an EPA inspector (Terry Kinney) who's assigned to inspect an Army base in the deep south (shot in Selma, Alabama). Meg Tilly plays his young wife while Christine Elise plays Anwar's friend on the base, the daughter of the commanding general, and Billy Wirth co-stars as Anwar's chopper-pilot beau (Wirth, by the way, looks like an early 90s version of Robert Pattinson from the Twilight films). Forest Whitaker is also on hand as a military psychologist at the base.Although "Body Snatchers" is a horror film it's a creepy/mysterious type of horror film and not a slasher/gore film. The gore you see is pretty much limited to the pod-people and is therefore more like vegetable-gore, lol. Anyway, the film has a nice haunting ambiance and everything works together for a standout film of this genre. The acting is superb and the swamplands of the deep south are utilized.Gabrielle has a beautiful face, but she's too skinny for my tastes, Elise too. As such, the female eye candy is limited to curvy Meg Tilly and her body-double Jennifer Tilly. Don't expect much on this front.Despite my fairly high opinion of "Body Snatchers," it bombed at the box office and so did the 2007 entry. It goes without saying, we probably won't see another stab at this story for some time.The film runs a short but sweet 87 minutes.GRADE: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Body Snatchers" (1993) is probably the best flick from these so called "Body Snatchers" movies. I saw 3 of them probably, but this one always was my favorite (the one with Donald Sutherland was also pretty good). It has good acting for this material, a very spooky mood, good direction and script. It's not particularly gory, but it has it's moments (make-up effects were very solid). The ending was very good and creepy - that last screaming sound was chilling.Overall, although "Body Snatchers" isn't very original or highly entraining or even a great art, it does exactly what it promises - it's has some scares, some thrills and a great feel of uncertainty which is always was a driving force in this so called franchise. This is a very solid genre movie and if you like the genre and premise, you will definitely going to like this flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Spoiler~Body Snatchers is the second attempt at updating Jack Finney's classic tale for a new generation. Let me preface this review by saying both the original film and the 70's remake are haunting pieces of cinema. Body Snatchers '93 doesn't quite live up to its predecessors. It's not a bad film per se, but with the pedigree it sports it should have been much better. Some of the names credited with the story and screenplay are Larry Cohen, Stuart Gordon, and Dennis Paoli. Those three names can be seen on some of the most famous horror posters of all time. And with a director like Abel Ferrara the film should have been more interesting. This time the invasion takes place solely on a military base witnessed through the eyes of outsider Gabrielle Anwar. Forest Whitaker is playing the paranoid role and Meg Tilly is the main "face" of the aliens. There are some good moments to be found and the pod effects look good because they are still practical at this point. The problem is once the pods become people. The aliens are supposed to be completely devoid of emotion yet I think they show a lot in this film. I also think they blew the "scream" out of proportion for this one. It's not nearly as haunting as the previous film. I still think it has its own merits and is far superior to the latest Nicole Kidman retread.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Abel Ferrara makes another quality film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Abel Ferrara is a talented and interesting director. He's made some great films ("bad lieutenant", "china girl") and he always seems to bring out the best in his actors. With "Body Snatchers", Ferrara tackles the task of directing a big budget, studio sci-fi film. And for the most part, he succeeds. Ferrara injects the film with tight closeups and experiments with tilted and off balanced framing. Making the viewer feel like something in the film is off and eschewed. But the film just isn't that exciting. It's more of a slow burner. It never really lives up to it's own potential sadly. But the effects are solid and some of the semi-transformation scenes are disturbing.The acting for the most part is solid with Meg Tilly giving the best monologue in the film. Gabrielle Anwar is gorgeous to stare at and Billy Wirth (Lost Boys) plays the chopper pilot hero. It could have been a better film, but "Body Snatchers" is entertaining, well-acted, and often creepy. I'm always surprised that an independent director like Ferrara was the guy chosen to helm such a big budget studio film...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Invasion of the Area 51 Body Snatchers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst waiting with anticipation for Abel Ferrara's King of New York to arrive in the post,I looked at his film listings on IMDb and I spotted this film,which I have seen being sold at some of the DVD shops near me.The main thing that caught my eye was,for a film that got pushed onto being a straight to video title in the UK by Warners,is,that it is a very well shot film,with an interesting story and a strong cast.The plot:The Malone family move to a military compound so that the husband/dad (Steve Malone) can do test on the soil and water in the area.This is due to some of the people in the area going "crazy" and becoming very paranoid ,and constantly saying that aliens are taking over the human race.Though the family first think that they have moved to a nice area,Their young son starts to think that something very wrong is happening.At his school,he notices that all the other children are painting the exact same picture identically!.Sadly for him,the problems don't stay at school ,when he realises that his mum is acting very strangely,which leads him to start telling the rest of the family that "Mummys dead".At first,they all think that he is being a very nasty kid.However,the older sister starts to think that he maybe telling the truth,when she wakes up to discover some that some extremely disturbing creatures have invaded there house.View on the film;When the credits flashed on the screen,listing the people that wrote the story and the screenplay to the film,I was very pleased to see the very talented Larry Cohen and Stuart Gordon being listed as two of the people that wrote the film.Whilst the stunning 1956 and the 1978 versions of the Body Snatchers,had a strong subtext about Communism (the 56 version)or,a post-Watergate America (the 78 version),this version has a very strong Stephen King/X-Files feel.The first part of the film is spent building the characters up and giving them some depth.The film also does a great job at tapping into a government/military Trust-No- One paranoia.This is done by setting most the film on an army base,that has some very strong overtones of being based on the infamous Area 51.From almost the first few minutes of the film,my reaction to Abel Ferrars direction,was one of complete amazement.Whilst most film makers would have made this film in a rush,and have turned it into a bad B- Movie (espicaly with all the trouble that Warners were giving Ferrara about the film.)Instead,Abel shoots the film in a fantastic way,with some surprisingly impressive camera moves,a very daring ending (an ending,that the legendary director Don Siegel originally wanted for his version of the Body Snatchers,until the studio told him to go for a more "optimistic" ending instead)and by doing a great job at building up the tension,as the last remaining humans try to escape the unstoppable invasion.Final view on the film:A great sci-fi thriller,with a strong story and excellent direction by Abel Ferrara.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very worthy remake ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don Siegel's Invasion of the Body Snatchers is an extraordinary film insomuch as its invasion narrative stands up to multiple interpretations that include anti- communism, McCarthyism (pro and con), miscegenation, anti-fordism, cultural conformity, and so on. Despite its many treasures and iconic status, there is just a bit too much emphasis placed on Siegel's version when it comes to considering the various remakes. Kauffman's 1978 version is my personal favourite as it turns San Francisco, the flower-power capital of late 60s free love and counter-culture into an Orwellian metropolis where mental health is precarious, individuation is outlawed and an absence of passion is normalised. I'm also a fan of Denny Zeitlin's creepy synth score, Kevin McCarthy's wink-wink cameo (knocked down by taxi driving Siegel, no less), and the introduction of that iconic other-worldly scream when a human is spotted - which was so effective it was incorporated in to the two subsequent remakes.Abel Ferarra's subversive version came hot on the heals of Operation Desert Storm where we saw invasion and counter-invasion televised pretty much 24/7 as the nation rallied around its troops and televisions. Ferrera's film is perhaps the most incendiary version as it dares to question USA's ubiquitous military culture driven by intense paranoia. No longer do we see the occasional man in uniform on an urban street. Rather, Ferrara reverses things, staging the action on an army base so that now we only see occasional citizens among scores of soldiers - and this creates a creepy us-and-them atmosphere from the outset. This invasion does not come from without, but from within as the line that separates soldier from citizen is erased. This makes Ferrara's film nothing like the "original" but a wholly unique and original work that stands on its own. Ferarra's version provides such a damning critique of a rarely challenged aspect of American culture that it's no wonder so many have dismissed it, picking on superficial elements and dated production values in preference to actually taking it seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>remade, but not a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film covers new ground in the pod genre. Set in the structured confines of a military base, the submersion of individuality into the so-called greater good is already in process before the intelligent alien plant attack even occurs. The alien minds were thinking overtime when they chose the base as a beginning for their takeover of our personalities. Moreso, the film has developed the characters to a higher level and taken the concept not only to the military but placed it in an unsettling military base elementary school setting as well, achieving a uniquely disquieting effect. The standout performance by Meg Tilly as the mother whose transformation into "one of them" lingers on in the memory, as do her chilling words to her freaked out family. Directed by Abel Ferrara, the idea that Don Siegel developed so well in the 50's classic, has an updated and even more sinister interpretation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid premise, good special effects and some memorable, chilling moments. What more could you ask for?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Body Snatchers" is a good horror/thriller with excellent special effects. I can't speak as to whether or not it's a remake that stays faithful to the original, but my gut says that this Is a worthy adaptation. The ending isn't as strong as the scenes that precede it, but overall it's an enjoyable sci-fi paranoia film. The premise is basically that there's an alien invasion going on right before our eyes. The extra terrestrials wait until you fall asleep and when you do, you get sucked up Inside of a weird pod and replaced with a doppelganger. There's a lot of potential there and I bet you can already see why this premise has endured over the years. How do you know who you can trust, how are you going to convince the others that something is amiss and how are we supposed to win? I found that the picture takes a bit too long to set up. I understand that every plot point needs to be introduces thoroughly and all, but considering this is the third version of the film, and the material has been imitated and ripped off countless times, you probably already know where it's going in the beginning, and you'll grow restless waiting for everyone to catch up to you. Once it gets started there are a lot of tense parts that will keep you on your toes and some real surprises as friends and foes become indistinguishable from each other. The film really convincingly portrays the body snatchers and their pods and the special effects alone make the movie worth a watch, even though the very end of the film is anti-climactic and contains one very bad special effect that's embarrassing to see. There's a really chilling moment when you realize really how dire the situation Is that's permanently ingrained in my mind. Just thinking about it makes me uneasy, and no matter how many times it's made fun of, it still gives me the shivers. It's worth seeking out. (On DVD, November 6, 2012)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Scary As It Gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By its very definition this movie shouldn't be special. First, it resides in a genre that typically repeats itself over and over and over. Second, it is the second remake of a classic, in this case 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers'. But unlike most horror remakes this one is different. It's actually scary.We know the story by now: Aliens are dropping to earth and killing off human beings and leaving soulless clones in their place. A young girl named Marti (Gabrielle Anwar) not only discovers their plot but finds that it has settled in her home. Naturally, no one will believe her.Now this seems like a lot of hum-drum hooey but director Abel Ferrara gives it a genuine style. He avoids the haggard clichés that often are the norm for this kind of film. He cleverly uses the rigid military as the alien's base of operations. There is something at risk in 'Body Snatchers': Our very humanity.Why did so many people miss out on 'Body Snatchers'? I guess they were so tuned into these clichés that they didn't recognize a horror film without them. This is a horror movie that is steeped in it's atmosphere, it's action and doesn't waste time with a lot of talking heads and theories. Its a strange concept . . . a horror movie this is actually scary!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gabrielle Anwar tries to escape the insidious pods that duplicate only part of a human being</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Body Snatchers" (1993) uses the same plot idea as the other body snatcher movies, which is that the earth is being insidiously attacked by an alien life form from outer space. This life form starts as a pod. It grows tentacles that take cellular material (presumably DNA and other vital substances) from human beings so as to grow a duplicate being. This duplicate being lacks emotions, however. In addition, it has genetic material from the pods so that it has a built-in purpose of reproducing. The pods share a common purpose which is to take over all human life. The physical takeover occurs when a human goes to sleep and a nearby pod has tentacles that reach out and absorb what they need from the sleeping human.In this version, the protagonist is Gabrielle Anwar, who narrates. Her family takes her to an army base where the pods have invaded. This they gradually discover. The pods make inroads into her family and she turns to a young soldier in her attempts to cope and escape.The movie is done in neo-noir fashion and it is well-directed by Abel Ferrara. He introduces good visuals to complement the story. There are some creepy special effects. The script makes a point of drawing parallels between the ordinary robotic and obedient behavior of army personnel and their emotionless condition when taken over by the pods. One has a hard time telling them apart.The weakest aspect of the movie is the script adaptation. It doesn't follow through enough on the information that's being received by the characters, in order to bring out their changing realizations and dilemmas. It doesn't create enough suspenseful moments. There are several plot jumps. After awhile, it goes into more an action kind of scenario in which logical development plays a very subdued role. In the end the movie, while average, is not gripping enough to become a classic. I felt the capable direction was not being levered up enough by the story. The actors were capable enough but they didn't possess the depth to be able to lift the story by virtue of their individual characterizations.Overall, I liked the movie well enough even though I can't say it's anything special. I think the IMDb rating of 5.9 is about right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An above-average midnight movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this last night via the PlayStation Network's movie rental service. Before I get started, I'd like to say that, while I haven't seen the '56 original, I have seen the '78 remake with Donald Sutherland, which I feel ranks as one of the best horror films I've seen. Going into this, I wasn't expecting it to live up to the '78 version, but I was expecting to be entertained. And while it wasn't a great movie, it did fulfill my expectations.First off, the special effects for the pods are phenomenal. The pods are all practical effects, which is made more impressive by the fact that, unlike the '78 version, they had the option of CGI at this point. The scene where the pods are attacking Marti and Steve (two scenes for the former) are extremely tense, and honestly had me thinking "oh my god they're actually gonna do it they're gonna kill the main characters". However, I feel that the effects here are overused. In '78, when you saw Elizabeth crumble into dust as a result of being absorbed by her pod, it hit hard. Here, however, the same effect is used at least half a dozen times for cheap shocks, wearing it out quickly.The setting also served to provide some nice commentary on the '90s. All of the films are basically products of their times. In '56, the theme was, depending on how you look at it, either the Red Menace or McCarthyism. In '78, it was pop psychology, born-again Christianity, and the alienation of urban life that got satirized. Here in '93, the theme is the conformity of modern life, which turns people into soulless pod creatures even without aliens taking their bodies. It's fitting that the takeover is already underway when the Malones arrive at the base, because to some extent, the soldiers have long ago suppressed their individuality in the name of their community. It's just how the Army works. And by having the protagonist be a teenage girl, the concept is extended to suburban drudgery as well. Some have complained that this defeats the whole point of the movie, but I feel that it strengthens it. After all, what is the difference between the titular body snatchers and the mindless conformity of our suburban lives? And now you know why the basic "body snatcher" idea is so scary and effective -- it can be applied to anything, in any era.The acting is serviceable. Gabrielle Anwar and Meg Tilly are the standouts here, the former carrying much of the film and looking damn good doing it, and the latter delivering the "where you gonna run" speech, which is the film's single greatest line. Forest Whitaker and R. Lee Ermey are wasted though, each having only a couple of scenes, and the latter not breaking from his typecasting as a hardass authority figure. Billy Wirth gets the "hero" role and plays it well enough, although he and Anwar had no chemistry. Their kiss was one of the most unconvincing that I had ever seen, and the most unintentionally funny scene in the movie. Terry Kinney is rather plain as the dad, while Christine Elise does well in her small part as the general's rebellious daughter. One complaint that I have is that the pod people have a bit too much emotion. You're supposed to believe that they're soulless and emotionless (like, well, pod people), but seeing them raise their voices, as if they're angry, takes away from this.Overall, I had a good time with this movie. It had its scary moments, some standout performances, and good ideas behind it, but overall, the execution didn't quite live up to the promise. If you're looking for a modern take on the "body snatcher" story, I'd recommend The Faculty, although this is also worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third official version of the film so far, updated to modern day and set in a US army base. The whole film is set up for tension and the sense of being surrounded with little chance for escape. It is very short, adding to this quality and giving a sense of urgency few recent films have been able to match. A family moves to the camp as the father has to run some tests in the area. His new wife and son come too along with his daughter from a previous relationship, setting up an 'evil step-mum dynamic'. She is 17 and feels estranged from everyone, imprisoned, and believes she will soon be free. Her father does his tests, under strict supervision from armed guards, her brother finds his classmates and teacher to be a little odd, and she makes a few friends- one the daughter of the General, the other a soldier. Soon things get worse, and a plot to replace the human race with alien clones is uncovered. It becomes a race to escape and warn the world, but who is human and who is not? Ferarra creates a great deal of tension in a short time, and excellent performances from all, particularly Anwar and Tilly help to add to the fear. We do not know who to trust. Whitaker's performance is also very good. Tilly's 'where you gonna go' scene is terrifying, and some of the effects are very effective. There is little humour, little shows of emotion all adding to the idea that people may not be what they seem. A vastly underrated movie, almost as good as its predecessors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only a pod person wouldn't like this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the third version taken directly from Jack Finney's story and it is just as successful as the other two. One reason is because it's just a hella great horror story. Another is because the way to approach this material (and just about any horror story) is straight forward with little mucking about and little whining. Even before the horror starts there are ingeniously charming scenes like Gabrielle Anwar and Billy Wirth's finger game. Then Meg Tilly gives one of the scariest short performances in movie history. She is completely detached from the human race. It falters compared to the 50's version (the version I'm most familiar with) only in the way you don't get a real sense of how tired the main characters are at the end, but nevertheless, one of the best horror movies of the 90's. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ferrara's riff on the Bodysnatchers story takes us onto a military base this time, as an environmental scientist and his family arrive to take up a month long placement. Are those soldiers unemotional because they're soldiers or because of something more sinister? Ferrara's film doesn't really work in the end, but it does contain some highly effective set pieces - the eery collection of refuse sacks each morning, the nursery class creating identical paintings, the first attempt to 'snatch' Marti as she dozes in the bath. Best of all though has to be Meg Tilly. By allowing Carol to be cool towards her step-daughter from the beginning, Ferrara hints at what is to come, and her final attempt to persuade her terrified 'husband' to give in to the inevitable is a brilliantly chilling study in quiet menace. Always more interesting than her 'in-yer-face' sister Jennifer, it makes you wonder why Meg retired from the screen two years later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Body Snatchers" is definitely the poorest of the three Snatcher films. It is uninspired and sloppily written--lacking all the style and finesse that the other two "Invasion" films are famous for. The film is set in a military instillation which isn't conducive for good horror and thrills. The locale fails for the same reason it did as the setting for "Child's Play 3". It's too distant from us, too foreign...we can't easily relate to it. Movies set in small towns and cities scare us because that IS our world--it's our familiar.The special effects are great and it's a fun rental. I like some of the scenes, most were so cheesy I had to laugh. (Especially when the "pod soldier" let the protagonist fly away in the helicopter because he didn't emotionally react to, "I F___ed your girlfriend." Give me a break!) It's an okay film--treasure the first two "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" and throw "Body Snatchers" on if you have nothing better to do. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surreal Take on the Subject</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Body Snatchers (1993)*** (out of 4) Teenager Marti Malone (Gabrielle Anwar) travels to an Army base with her father (Terry Kinney), stepmom (Meg Tilly) and her young brother. Before long she realizes that something isn't right with some of the people on the base and it turns out that some of them are pods of their former being.Abel Ferrara's BODY SNATCHERS has the unlucky job of trying to follow up two very well-known and very much loved films. The 1956 version of this is without question one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made and the 1978 version with Donald Sutherland is also quite good. This third version isn't nearly in the same league as those two pictures but at the same time I've always liked this one and it's rather surreal and bizarre atmosphere.Ferrara might have seemed like an unlikely person to direct this "mainstream" picture but he's got a couple other genre people on board. Larry Cohen is credited as one of the story writers and we've also got Stuart Gordon credited as one of the co-screenplay writers. The three of them gives this version of the story a few nice twists including how it's more psychological than the previous two films. This probably accounts for the bizarre atmosphere that is hanging over the film because there's just a very dry feel to the entire picture and an uneasy nature that really comes across.The film also benefits from some very good performances including Anwar who is very believable in the role of the teenager who finds everyone she knew suddenly changing. Kinney is also good as the father and Billy Wirth also delivers a fine performance. Meg Tilly is also extremely good as the stepmother. We're also treated to some very good cinematography as well as a score that perfectly fits the material.As much as I enjoy this version of the story, there's still always been something that just didn't sit right. I've seen the film around four or five times and I still don't know exactly what it's missing but perhaps a longer running time would have worked. Several subjects are touched upon in the short running time and perhaps these could have been better explored in a longer movie. I'm not sure. Either way, BODY SNATCHERS deserves to have a better reputation than it has.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>solid execution of familiar premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The EPA sends Steve Malone (Terry Kinney) to a military base in Alabama for a month. He brings along his daughter Marti (Gabrielle Anwar), his second wife Carol (Meg Tilly) and their son Andy. Marti is scared by a soldier who tells her that "They get you when you sleep". She befriends base commander (R. Lee Ermey)'s wild daughter Jenn Platt (Christine Elise). She falls for chopper pilot Tim Young (Billy Wirth). There are strange things happening and Maj. Collins (Forest Whitaker) asks Steve if it could be chemical toxins. Military personnel delivers mysterious boxes to the Malones. Carol is the first to turn.The major drawback is that the premise is known to everybody. There is no surprises except for the sci-fi uninitiated. The bathtub scene is pretty good although it's nothing shocking. This is a solid execution. The army base location is pretty good. Body snatchers can be camouflaged by being stoic soldiers and they are pretty creepy. There is nothing wrong with this version but it adds nothing new to the idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Admittedly, I was certain I was headed for B-movie hell when I first queued up The Body Snatchers, and I am happy to say that my initial impressions of the film were wrong. I can't compare this 1993 version to the earlier ones as I have not yet seen them, but on it's own merits, The Body Snatchers is quite an exciting movie. The story this time is centered around a U.S. military base where most of the personnel seem to be mere vessels for some sort of extra-terrestrial beings intent on taking over the human race. The creature effects are quite good (we actually don't see too many creatures but but a lot of tentacles make for some queasy moments) and we get some decent bloody chunks of gore here an there. From an acting perspective I thought everyone was solid and have no complaints. I was particularly impressed with R. Lee Ermey was down played his character and it worked. I've always found his characters a little to hammy to take seriously. Also noteworthy is the musical score/sound which gave the movie a lot of its creepiness. Perhaps not overly musical but definitely eerie. All in all I would give The Body Snatchers a solid 7 out of ten, Perhaps losing a mark for a slow beginning. But once The Body Snatchers Kicks it into High gear around the half hour mark, it's an unrelenting thrill fest that demands to be seen at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven remake of a 1950s SF classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fans of Abel Ferrara have always been in for a bumpy ride, never knowing what this talented but uneven director is going to give you. 'Body Snatchers' is a case in point. Ferrara follows up his two best movies ('King Of New York' and 'Bad Lieutenant') with this one, which may not actually be his WORST (that just might be 'Fear City'), but is without a doubt his most frustrating. 'Body Snatchers' is based on a classic Jack Finney novella which was made into a classic 1950s movie of paranoia by Don Siegel, and once again in the 1970s by Philip Kaufman. While I didn't think Kaufman's remake was quite as effective as the original version, it still remains one of the best SF/horror remakes of all time, up there with Herzog's 'Nosferatu', Carpenter's 'The Thing' and Cronenberg's 'The Fly'. Kaufman changed the setting from a small town to a big city (San Francisco), but by still having his main characters a part of the community, the horror of the tale remained intact. Ferrara, or should I say his FIVE writers (who include Larry 'Q' Cohen, Stuart 'Re-Animator' Gordon and Ferrara's regular collaborator Nicholas St. John), inexplicably decided to not only make their protagonists new arrivals in town, but make the story (which I won't spoil just in case you can't guess from the title what this is all about!) already underway. This ruins most of the nail biting suspense and paranoia of the plot! And by setting the action on a military base where soldiers are required NOT to act like individuals in the first place is another truly dumb move. I just had to slap my hand to my forehead and exclaim "what WERE they thinking?!". Anyway, the cast, led by the beautiful Gabrielle Anwar ('Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead'), and also including Meg Tilly ('Agnes Of God'), Forest Whitaker ('Species') and R. Lee Ermey ('Full Metal Jacket') are all very good, and their are a few genuine scares along the way, but overall the script really lets this one down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another pretty good update</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another version of the 1958 classic, which was previously updated in 1978.This time the story is set on a military base where Steve Malone moves in with his family. His job to look for toxins that might be at high levels in the grounds of the base, but soon strange things begin to happen and certain people "aren't themselves anymore." People who have seen the previous two versions know exactly what this means. However, whether you know or not the film manages to be an eerie thriller in parts. There is a change in perspective from the previous two versions as the focus here is more on the family, but it still remains in subtle ways as a parable. But it is that family aspect that gives this version its push. The examination of trust and mistrust within the family unsentimental and compelling. Carol's monologue to her husband Steve in a key moment will literally make you grow goosebumps. And the end, which will be familiar to those of you who've seen the previous version, has it's own spin and take on the situation and what led up to it. The way hope and despair are mixed and shown makes the ending worth seeing, but unexpectedly abrupt. Though, abrupt in this case means "chilling." That makes it not quite the first which ended in despair. Different from the second which was chilling, but final moment was that of terror. Here it is... just chilling.Then the special effects are pretty good too with the pods getting just enough screen time to keep you thinking about what they are, but also enough to send shudders down your spine. --- 7/10Not Rated, contains violence and horror. Ages 13+.</fullReview>

This was okay, no more, no less. Perhaps being aware of the plot kept that feeling of dread from taking hold. I have always really liked Meg Tilly, but with such an odd role here, it is difficult to rate her performance. R. Lee Ermey was wasted on his part, and anyway, he is forever type-cast as the quintessential drill instructor. Gabrielle Anwar, with whom I was unfamiliar, played the point-of-view character, and did pretty well with it. She was fairly cute, too. This film is worth checking out on cable or something, but it's no classic.</fullReview>

He leaves his mark all over the place.

		<shortDescription>A Big Let-Down...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first two "Body Snatchers" are amongst the most terrifying films ever made. The philosophic concept of a loved one suddenly becoming a total stranger is scary and haunting, and both INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS easily induce nightmares. That said, what a let down BODY SNATCHERS is. The first key element that fails us is in the main characters. In the first two films, we embrace the main protagonists Miles/Becky or Matthew/Elizabeth...we care what happens to these people. We don't want them to succumb to the alien enemy. And when they do, we feel major loss and horror. In this update, there's NO ONE to really care about- our "heroine" is a sullen teenage girl(Gabrielle Anwar). Her Dad(Terry Kinney)is a self-involved and remote scientist, she's at odds with her stepmother(Meg Tilley), her little brother doesn't have much joy in his life...and this family is plopped down on a military base in the midst of being "taken over" by the pods. When you don't really have any in the film that you care about, seeing them "converted" doesn't really register(as it does in the first two films). Also, in the those films, we're dealing with a small town and a big city- there's LOTS of varieties of personality types to examine... but what can you expect on a military base, where the soldiers are all pretty zombified into conformity already? As agreed by most, probably the creepiest scene is delivered by Tilly, when her pod version whispers "Where ya gonna go? Where ya gonna run? Where ya gonna hide? Nowhere. Cuz...there's...no one...like you...left." Simply bone-chilling. Unfortunately, that's about it. Yeah, the "transformation" scenes are a lot more evolved than the '78 SNATCHERS, but there's simply too little emotional involvement to what's going on, let alone any suspense. And the ending is simply a sloppy mess- like the previous versions, there's no real resolution to the invasion, but in this case, it's simply NOT satisfying. In conclusion, the two "INVASION" films remain classics, because their incredible mix of sci-fi horror and the dramatic depths they draw their audiences into. BODY SNATCHERS, for the most part, is an uninvolving bore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>still baffled by the general esteem for abel ferrara</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time I watch an Abel Ferrara movie, I keep hoping that I will finally begin to understand why he is considered by so many to be an interesting and original independent film-maker. And each time I become more baffled as to how anyone ever got the idea of esteeming him so highly. Admittedly, a SECOND remake of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" would have been a tough job for even a genuinely brilliant director to pull off successfully, given that both the original and the first remake were both excellent, subtle, complex movies in their own right. But Ferrara and his scriptwriter seem to ruin their own slim chances from the very outset - above all through the almost incomprehensibly dumb and clumsy decision to set this version on a military base, of all places. Both Siegel's original version and Kaufman's first remake had given themselves a chance to draw on that deepest source of terror - ambiguity - by setting their movies in environments that were innocuous and even comforting on the surface: the generic American "small town" of the 1950s and the affluent libertarian paradise of 1970s San Francisco. What a crazy casting-away of this important resource to set the story in an army camp - an environment which is bristling with menace and alienation even when there is NO sinister alien force at work in it! The scenes with glassy-eyed soldiers in Ferrara's film understandably produce absolutely nothing of the unsettling effect of the scenes of glassy-eyed San Franciscan store-clerks and dentists in Kaufman's - for the simple reason that a soldier is MEANT to be glassy-eyed! Even on the "micro"-level, though, the script is a disaster - another cheap and shoddy piece of work from Nicholas St. John which really makes one wonder why Ferrara works so consistently with this hack. The voice-over given to Gabrielle Anwar is embarrassingly lacking in subtlety - "If we had known what was going to happen, we would have run..." - and appears to be intended to try to generate a tension that the action itself fails to generate. But scene after individual scene reeks of psychological implausibility and lazy writing. To choose just one example among many, take the little game of "Never" played by Anwar and the young soldier she is falling in love with. This "truth-or-dare"-type game is clearly a device to accellerate the process of the two characters' becoming intimate with one another. But the staging of the moments of "discovery of the other's secrets" is hopelessly artificial. We are asked to believe, for example, that the young girl played by Anwar would be shocked and moved to discover that the answer to the question "Have you ever shot someone?" is "Yes" - when it is put to a serving member of the US armed forces! This painfully artificial scene is pretty representative of the artificiality and uninspiredness of the whole film. As I say, another reason to ask: what the hell does anyone SEE in Abel Ferrara?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie tries very hard to be a sequel to the Philip Kaufman film. It even copies Ben Burtt's sound design. Very little reference is made to the original film, to the point where I wonder if the screenwriter even saw the original version. This outing doesn't stand up on its own. I doubt it would make much sense to someone who hasn't seen the Kaufman version, and as a sequel it just fails miserably, adding nothing that hasn't been done before.Stick with the other two versions. They're genuinely scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Body Snatchers" is the second remake of the venerable "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", and it serves as yet more evidence that remakes are usually a bad idea. The plot involves some pods of rather nebulous origin that kill people while they sleep and replace them with emotionless copies. The filmmakers steadfastly ignore all of the interesting metaphoric possibilities of this plot in favor of failed attempts to make 3-dimensional characters, through overuse of cliched familial strife, and a series of very uninvolving, uninteresting, un-scary action sequences. The only thing of any interest in this film is the characteristically luminous Gabrielle Anwar, who strives vainly to make her cardboard-thin character interesting. Forget this pathetic version of the film, and rent the 1956 original instead.Overall Rating: 2 (out of 10), or one-half star (out of 4)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this unconvincing movie last night via video rental. I thought it was over-acted in many phases of the word: The screeching, the weak attempts at testing people to see if they are actually cloned, or just pretending to be(Pretty corny)with the basis of the characters evolved around a family of four and a stoned-faced military base. The acting is mediocre at best, and often over-acted(Which I stated earlier). The direction is sloppy, with no real suspense or irony. Sorry, I just could n't adhere to this film. The plot contains a group of family members being victimized, while at the same time terrorized by a large system of abductors disguised in the form of military ground. The parasites are going around rather quickly with no one suspecting fast enough to stop it. With the supposed drama being dispersed, the victims never become involved in trying to figure how what has happened, and what's causing it. Not very exciting, but rather preposterous. I saw "Body Snatchers" of 1956 and 1978, and found both to be creative with the re-make merely the best piece. The third outing did not live up to neither one. Rated *1/2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Another Remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why Ferrara did it. I suppose just to add incremental touches to bring the story up to date. The original, directed by Don Siegel, was set in a small California town in which everyone knew everyone else and featured as its protagonist a doctor who was on familiar terms with his patients and made house calls. That world has disappeared, of course. The 1970s remake, more whimsical in its own way, was set in a city and featured a Public Health worker. It added special effects that weren't available in the 1950s and were creepy. It also added a pig-like squeal of betrayal when one of the pod-people discovered a human in their midst. This business of the pod people deserves more attention than it gets in these movies; the human seem to turn into a kind of dirt after their absorption by the pods. They should be scientifically explicated but I'm afraid "podzology" would be claimed as a Russian invention. This one, from 1993, brings the old story even more up to date. Not only do we have the special effects from the 1970s version, but they are accompanied by foleyed-in sounds that are a cross between sizzling bacon and a Yellowstone mud hole of moderate magnitude. This version also adds the obligatory apocalyptic fireballs at the end -- not that they accomplish anything, just that the times call for them nowadays. The novella by John Finney first appeared in, I think Collier's Magazine, now defunct, and was far more reasonable and comprehensible than any of the movies that have been made from it. In the book we learn where the seeds come from, what happens to the humans, and how the pods are defeated. (They just give up and float away.) The first movie is by far the best, just a black and white rendering of the tale, with a blandly handsome Dr. Binnell and his immaculate girl friend. People shake their heads and groan because of the "happy ending" that the studio insisted be tacked on, but I liked it.There's nothing wrong with tragedy when it grows out of something -- human weakness, as in "Othello," or hubris, as in "Oedipus Rex." But no one in any of these movies has done anything truly wrong! They don't deserve to be robbed of their humanity, for however much that may be worth. The acting here is okay, not much more than that. Meg Tilly has interesting features. Like Merle Oberon's, her flaring cheeks seem to be tucked up just under her eyes, which slant upward and outward at an alarming dihedral. She has plump rounded lips and one or two moles scattered around her face, and it all adds up to a beautiful woman. But her voice is difficult to believe. Gabriel Anwar is likewise attractive, with wide-set eyes, a long gentle nose, and a generous mouth. Anwar has the innocence of one of those young virtuous maidens with long, floppy hair that sit around pools, staring wistfully into the ether, in Pre-Raphaelite paintings. She radiates adolescent nubility. Any normal man glimpsing her visage would immediately be prompted to pinch and bite her. And she acts as good as she looks. The guy who plays her Dad is a familiar face in TV movies, better as a heavy than a hero, and he's up to snuff. The dark-haired savior is just somebody's idea of a handsome movie star. If the first movie was supposed to be an analogy, with the pod people being Commies, or was it an anti-conformist tract, there seems to be some confusion -- this one looks like an anti-military analogy. It's set on an army base and all the pods are being trucked out for placement on yet other army bases -- Fort Bragg, Fort Bliss. Meg Tilly at one point, after her conversion to podness, asks her still straight husband, "Where will you go? Where will you hide? There is nobody left like you." How about a Navy base? How about the U. S. Coast Guard Light Station at Point Reyes? And the direction. If Blake had been writing about "Body Snatchers" instead of "Tygers" he might have asked: "Did he who made "The Bad Lieutenant" make thee? "Bad Lieutenant" is a truly shocking movie, far more powerful and scary than this one. Ferrara seems to have done nothing to perk this tired story up. It's craftmanship, and it's up to date, but nothing more than that. See the original. Read the novella, better yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third version of Jack Finney's solid novel is a minor improvement on the previous remake, but whereas the superior 1956 original had a slow build-up and an eerie atmosphere, this one relies on gooey effects rather than suspense. The alien invasion occurs this time on a military base, where teenager Gabrielle Anwar and pilot Billy Wirth uncover a plot that jumps jerkily forward rather than slowly letting us know that something's up. The '56 version really made me feel sorry for poor old Kevin McCarthy as the pods closed in on him, but there's no claustrophobia here. One or two spooky scenes - the kids' identical finger paintings, for instance - are atypical of the otherwise flat manner in which the movie squanders its plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Invasion of the Body Snatchers updated to the 90's, the location where the pod aliens surface and take over a military base..ideal place to control due to the military's ties to the US government. A family whose patriarch is a chemist running routine checks(..making sure the military are operating within proper procedural protocols), are besieged by the pod people(..having successfully imitated their human counterparts) and siblings Marti and Andy(Gabrielle Anwar and Reilly Murphy)must fend for themselves when their parents are taken from them, joining forces with pilot Tim(Billy Wirth)who will attempt to secure a helicopter and fly them to safety.You know the crux of director Abel Ferrara's BODY SNATCHERS isn't the fact that it isn't well made, with some effective camera-work(..although, Ferrara really is dependent on close-ups, really relying on his cast's faces to maintain our interest), but that the material offers practically nothing fresh or new other than the change of venue to a military base, featuring soldiers, and the family of outsiders bottled within unfamiliar terrain. Ferrara moves the story at such an accelerated rate, there's no time for any characterization. Anwar has quite a beautiful face, but she doesn't have much time to add depth or complexity to her character..and this goes for almost everyone other than Christine Elise, who is able to add color to her general's daughter. When R Lee Ermey fails to impress, you know something's off. The Malones obviously have issues, for we can see that stepmother Carol(Meg Tilly, given absolutely nothing to work with, which is a shame)and Marti have a somewhat strained relationship, but the dynamics of the family are never explored to any great lengths. It's basically, family moves into military base attempting to adapt to their new environs, soldiers are being turned into aliens, and the remaining running time shows Marti, Andy &amp; Tim trying to escape capture. Forest Whitaker is slapped with a paranoid military doctor role, Major Collins, and is provided about 5 or so total minutes to impress himself upon us. The whole movie is just so by-the-numbers and ordinary..if you didn't know Ferrara's name was attached to it, you'd figure some mediocre director with Hollywood's blessing and extra cash had directed it. When humans are drained by the pods, the carcasses shrivel into dust and bits of remains, scooped up by the new creature who has assumed their identity. Like in past "pod movies", our heroes are often startled by those who were once friends and relatives, now soulless beings who screech their warning signals to fellow aliens. Like in many other "aliens plan to take over the earth" sci-fi, BODY SNATCHERS has a grim outlook for humanity's survival.</fullReview>

Hollowood is no different, look at Kevin Costner's career.While this movie is by no means groundbreaking or particularly daring in its retelling of the classic 1950s Sci-Fi B Movie Archetype, it does have some interesting character development. Gabrielle Anwar gets the most screentime to explore her character and I get the feeling that scenes in which R. Lee Ermey and Forrest Whitaker came into their characters' found eternal rest on the cutting room floor. However, would America go see a 3 hour Body Snatchers?For those of you who are into camera work, there are interesting shots every now and then in this version, so if you see it on the dish or Sci-Fi channel and you have two hours to kill, there are worse things out there. 6 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Body Snatchers Remade Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second remake of the sci-fi classic Invasion of the Body Snatchers is decent but nowhere near as good as the original or the 1978 version. Part of the problem lies in the story's familiarity. Changing the setting does little to help the fact that you feel like you know what's going to happen throughout the movie. Actually, changing the setting in this case only serves to hurt the film, as the military base backdrop does more to diminish the paranoia than add to it. There are some good scenes and some creepy moments but ultimately there's a lack of real suspense and no surprises.The quality of the acting varies. Terry Kinney is solid and Meg Tilly is great when the scary business starts. Forrest Whitaker overacts. Christine Elise and R. Lee Ermey do what they always do -- portray themselves. Gabrielle Anwar is a little weak and Billy Wirth is wooden. Director Abel Ferrara, one of the most overrated directors in cinema history, does fine here. Nothing exceptional, but fine.The movie is entertaining enough. It moves at a decent pace and provides some creepy moments. What it does not do, however, is break new ground or have layers to it like the original film or, to a certain extent, the '78 remake. It's just good time killer. That's all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Foggy High-Camp Recollection of Lots of Other Superior Versions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ferrara made spiritual what Kaufman made satirical what Siegel made political: The invasion hasn't been thwarted, it's merely waiting on the right filmmaker every twenty years for passionate revision. Were there to be a "re-remake" of Jack Finney's pulpy source who better to attempt it than Ferrara, the hysterical director of Bad Lieutenant, King of New York and a slew of other overwrought films? I mean, discernment and restraint are the last things a third Body Snatchers required. However, they're the tendency of this slick but uninspired version. It could've been wheeled by any bland director who knows how to point a camera and resist affronting or disturbing anyone.Don Siegel's Invasion virtually declared McCarthyism the emblematic gist behind the obedient body snatchers. Ferrara probably didn't want to bother anatomizing the '50s fear politics with those, if any, of the '90s, and knew that the premise was well-known even to viewers who'd never seen the first two versions. So he's short and snappy. In the first 5 minutes, a frenzied soldier traps the alienated teenage daughter of the EPA agent protagonist in a gas station bathroom, lunging from the dark to present the distraught forewarning, "They're out there. They get you when you sleep." Nothing that ensues approaches that opening shove. Some tilted camera angles and some misty lighting are the only tinges of Ferrara's excessively melodramatic style, except perhaps Meg Tilly's chilling turn. This talent-filled interpretation boosts its creepiest dashes from the 1978 version: the tentacles that slither out of the pods, the way the pod people draw attention to humans and unleash a mechanical-seeming screech. But this third of four adaptations of the 1955 novel doesn't impart Phil Kaufman's film's feeling one can enjoy from the right kind of horror or sci-fi movie that makes you just want to snuggle up in front of the TV late at night or on a really rainy or snowy day, everything you need in arm's reach of the couch and ottoman, and lose yourself in it's eerily fun atmosphere.And there is merely a hazy recognition of lots of other superior horror material that Ferrara's anamorphically shot sci-fi thriller calls to mind. The opening credits indiscreetly recall The Twilight Zone. One teary mother echoes The Stepford Wives. The worry of sleep, which was in the original film, has since been declared by the Elm Street series. Ferrara and his capable writers fellow exploitation veteran Larry Cohen and uniquely Bohemian horror director Stuart Gordon must've understood this, but there's no lighthearted drollness about these loans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I move through the original film and the two remakes, I am dropping the rating each time. Does that Bode ill for The Inasion this summer? We will have to wait and see.They didn't wait 22 years to redo it the second time. This time they used Bad Lieutenant and King of New York director Abel Ferrara, and cast the young beauty Gabrielle Anwar (The Librarian: Return to King Solomon's Mines) and "thirthsomething" Terry Kinney in the leads. He went on to do The Laramie Project later and was fantastic.If you want conformity, then setting your movie on a military installation ensures that you have an easier time of it. Younger people will love this version, but just updating to modern techniques and special effects doesn't always make for a better picture.So, as we look forward to Kidman and Craig, we can discuss who did the best job in what will likely be the last remake - well, until our grandchildren's time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So, emotionless aliens have taken over the army? What is the difference?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with 1994's Puppet Masters, this movie unsuccessfully places an alien menace into the army. Both movies seem to never get by their shared good premise. This movie has some very good actors going through some thin material and coming out just north of OK. Meg Tilly, Terry Kinney(Last of the Mohicans, That Championship Season), Gabrielle Anwar, R. Lee Ermey(Full Metal Jacket), Forest Whitaker, and Christine Elise(Child's Play 2) are all satisfactory. The weak script has five names, including the author of the book, on it, which is too many chefs in the kitchen. In the 1978 version of Snatchers, a major character turns out to be BS in the end by giving up what could be the last human, which is a highly effective scene. This movie robs it, several times to lesser effect. Abel Ferrara(Ms. 45 and Bad Lieutenant) does give us some good scenes with creepy effects. The "where are you gonna go" speech that Meg Tilly gives her family is excellently delivered. The pods, in various stages of development, best the 1956 and 1978 versions. The ending is, in my opinion, the best concept of the three versions. But, Body Snatchers is merely a partially effective film with decent special effects and a capable cast and director that does not live up to it's predecessors.</fullReview>

Slowly, Marti and Andy discovers that things in this Military Base are not what they seemed. Civilians and Soldiers are acting-alike and they are humorless (Not to mention Soulless). Now the family find themselves in danger and you can't trust no one. The only thing, you can do to save yourself is to not fall asleep.Directed by Abel Ferrara (China Girl, The Funeral, King of New York) made an interesting, sometimes fascinating Science-Fiction thriller with good performances. The Special Effects are good, expect for one sequence towards the end in the helicopter. Tilly gets the most memorable, important lines of dialogue during one eerie scene is the most effective of the movie. "Body Snatchers" was unfortunately an box office disappointment, since Warner Bros didn't know how to market the picture. Despite some very good reviews from film critics, especially Roger Ebert. This movie was out in limited released instead but the film did have an cult following on video.DVD has an grainy anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (Also in Pan &amp; Scan) and an strong Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound. DVD has no special features. Oscar-Winner:Forest Whitaker has an bit part as a Military Doctor. This is the third adaptation of "Body Snatchers" and probably the least known of the four adaptations. Still, this version is better than the last adaptation, "The Invasion". The problem with the third version, the feature is somewhat too short of a real satisfaction but the real mistake was setting this at the Military Base, where everyone acts alike was not an good idea. Still, "Body Snatchers" is strong enough to overcome these flaws. Farrara's film is certainly well made but as a science-fiction thriller is joyless to say the least. Screen-Story by Raymond Cistheri and Larry Cohen (A Return to Salem's Lot, Phone Booth, Q:The Wigned Serpent). Screenplay by Staurt Gordon (Fortress, Re-Animator, Stuck), Dennis Paoli (Castle Freak, The Dentist, The Pit and the Pendulum) and Nicolas St. John (The Addiction, Dangerous Game, Fear City). Some die-hard fans of this version, imagine what professional "B" movie filmmaker:Gordon could have done with this third adaptation. Arriscope. (****/*****).</fullReview>

Trust vs. distrust, If I was in this movie I would be fighting all the pod people and not succumb to their single-minded views on how to live life.But everything else was good.

Acting by the family was okay, but the script is sub-par, and after waiting forever for something to happen, very little actually does occur. Delving into family conflicts and teen rebellion for drama is really unecessary--how about more about the creatures themselves, their methods or motivations?

		<fullReview>Now, I don't remember that much from the film, tells you how much I enjoyed it, but I do remember that it was about a family who moves to a military base to control a spill or something, and strange things happen. What I remember was the poor attempt to scare the living daylights out of me, I laughed rather than frightened. I was only 10, so.I want to comment about the scare factor of this film. It wasn't scary, nor was it even close to scary. Granted, they had some great ideas and some, some, frightening images that could have been reworked into something magnificent but they didn't. Case in point, the tentacles hanging down from the air vents looked like dental floss rather than tentacles. The point when all the kids were drawing those pictures and everyone in the base stared to sound their voices, would have been really freaky had it been done better. Instead the actors seemed as though they were trying not to laugh.The performances were great; in fact, I enjoyed the performances by R. Lee Ermey and Forest Whitaker. I enjoyed the performances by Gabrielle Anwar and Billy Wirth, but the others did a pretty bad job. I will say, the acting saved this movie for me. But other than that, I can't really comment on the acting.Overall, this movie was a disappointment to me, I don't think I will ever pick it up again and I don't think that I will ever show it to any of my friends. I don't know about other horror fans because it may be a cult classic, but in my case, I don't think I would recommend this movie to any horror fans, but if you want a horror film that is unintentionally scary, then be my guest to rent it. Don't pay money to see, but rent it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Invasion of The Body Snatchers started as a novel then in 1956 it was done into a movie, in 1978 it was done into a remake starring Donald Sutherland and it still is a classic remake. In 1993 another remake was made this time just called Body Snatchers and it is another great remake, the film does something different by having it in an army base instead of a city. The acting is great, the Body Snatcthers are creepy especially Meg Tilly (Psycho II) who says one of the catchiest lines "Where you gonna go?", Body Snatchers also has some creepy scenes like in the day care where all the children have drawn the same pictures but Andy hasn't so the teacher tells him to go to sleep, also the scene in the bathroom is creepy. The film also has some gory scenes like the dissolving head and the pods growing a life form.Body Snatachers is a great remake that's just has good as the 1978 remake Invasion of the Body Snatchers, it's creepy, atmospheric and great fun to watch. Check this out. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect example of why we sometimes don't need remakes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second remake to the 1956 classic has a family moving near a military base where everyone acts alike, within time the daughter begins to feel that there's something going wrong with the residents in the town &amp; with the help of her new boyfriend, discovers that alien pods are taking over the minds &amp; actions of humans &amp; she rushes to save her family before they to are taken over. As I said in the summary above, this is a perfect example of why we sometimes don't need remakes, Body Snatchers 93' is all right, but falls flat on it's face when compared to both the 1956 &amp; 1978 versions of the same movie, ABEL FERRARA tried to do something different with his version (In fact this is more like a re-imagining than a remake,) but the film has none of the suspense, weirdness &amp; scariness much less the interest of the 56 version or it's remake, the special effects are better than what was seen in the previous two, but there's not much to recommend here. Worth seeing if you've wanted to see all three versions or if you're a Ferrara fan, but other than that it's best you skip this one &amp; go for both the 1956 &amp; 1978 versions, they're much better than this one. Followed by another soon to be released remake! ENOUGH ALREADY! ** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is not 100% garbage but it's not a good film - it's is bad though. The only thing I like about this film are 3 actors: Meg Tilly, Forest Whitaker and R. Lee Ermey - that's it. Nothing else good can be said about this movie coming from me.If you want to see a good "body snatchers" film watch the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) or even the 1978 remake which is pretty good - the original is the best.This 1993 film - I have nothing good to say about it. The first 45 minutes is mainly about a family moving into a new area and the "drama' between a teen daughter, her father and step-mother. This teen daughter gets a new friend and a boyfriend - wow just wow. I am not wanting to watch a teen drama I'm wanting to watch another remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and this remake basically sucks - minus 3 actors that I have already mentioned. I'm giving it 3 stars - one star for each actor because the movie is terrible.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was the least of the body snatchers films - until the Kidman version came out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original story by Jack Finney is thrown headlong into the 1990s in this, the third adaptation of the original classic of paranoia, following the other versions released in 1956 and 1978. While this film could have been a total fiasco, much like other remakes we've been seeing in the '90s, the one saving grace is the presence of director Abel Ferrara, who, along with Stuart Gordon and Larry Cohen lifts the average material to more than it might have been. However, it might not be enough...The trouble with horror films of the 1990s is that even when they do get something right, they do just about everything else wrong. WISHMASTER had great gory ideas, but a tepid plot. I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, well... that didn't really have anything did it? Anyhow I digress. BODY SNATCHERS is full of atmospheric imagery and bursting with style, but sadly the plot and script are turgid, relentlessly chewed up hundreds of times before in other films, and therefore lacking any real sense of menace.Ferrara gets carried away with the Raimi-like diagonal camera angles, filling every scene with haunting shadows. Which is great, you know, but somewhat...pretentious? Unfortunately the cast is populated with dense, unlikable characters, and even the little boy turns out to be a stereotyped whining American brat. The females are bland, the actor playing the father is expressionless, with the only believable character being Forest Whitaker (ironically his character is almost an exact replica of Kevin McCarthy's hero in the original classic). This really drags down the attention level. Plot wise, the idea of setting the story in a military base is quite effective, but once you realise that it's just a one-note idea which is never fully explored, then you feel that it's quite a letdown.The film is in two halves. In the first half, there are vague shadows and sounds but nothing much really happens. After an effects-laden scene in the middle of the film, it becomes one elongated chase movie, all set at night and involving people running in a variety of settings. Does this sound like your idea of fun? Not really. The film does benefit from some good special effects in the form of the alien pods, although they're almost exact replicas of the pods from 1978's sublime INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS.There is some nudity put in to spice things up which seems quite desperate, and two great scenes which make the film worth watching. However apart from these key moments and an ambiguous ending, the film never really goes anywhere. If it was original I would give it a higher mark but the trouble is that we've seen it all before, twice before, and it was better both of those times so the third outing just appears to be a tired rerun of the earlier events.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Modern (1990s) Attempt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A teenage girl and her father discover alien clones are replacing humans on a remote U.S. military base in Alabama.So, as of today (2015) there are, to my knowledge, four official versions of this story. The 1950s, the 1970s, the 1990s and a movie called "Invasion" from around 2007. The first two seem to be vaguely inspired by the novel (which is very good), the third one only loosely so, and I have no idea about the fourth.I want to like this one. It is not a bad movie. Some say it is the best, but I am not sure exactly why they think that. For me, it will always be the 1970s one that reigns. This one just seemed weak. I like what they tried to do with the gore effects, but they are no real improvement over the 70s version, and the characters just are not as strong (nor do they have the actors to back them up).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm guessing I would have liked this a little better had I seen it closer to its release date. Now I can't help but compare it to The Faculty, which I absolutely love, so it was a little dull to me.The effects are pretty decent, and the story is kind of cool, there are some cool elements here and there, but all in all I wasn't that impressed. But like I said, had I seen this in the early nineties, I would probably have been fascinated by the story. It's short, which is a good thing, and it's pretty bleak which I like. It does take a while for it to get going, and when it does, it doesn't go all that fast. It's not a nail biter. Yeah yeah, it's alright, but for the ultimate Alien-taking-over-human- bodies-movie, I'd definitely go with The Faculty. (which is based on the same premise, btw)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different but certainly not bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years several 'The Body Snatchers' movies were made. Non of them were much alike really and they are set at different places with different characters each time. This version of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' is certainly not as bad as its reputation and as a matter of fact is actually a quite good genre movie on its own.This time events are taking place at a military base. The concept is still the same though, in which in alien invasion takes place by letting mysterious pods replicate and killing human bodies in their sleep. The pods look like an exact copy of their victim but of course they are not. In my opinion the story behind 'The Body Snatchers' has always been one of the most original and best ones, concerning movies dealing with an alien invasion.Its concept provide the movie with plenty of tension and also mystery, especially when you have not seen a 'The Body Snatchers' movie before. This particular movie version does also handle its concept well. It's not as great as the previous two movie version of it but it still has plenty of good moments and originality of its own in it. It's certainly better and way more exciting to watch than the 2007 movie version, starring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig.I still wished this movie had some of those great actors in it. There are some good actors in this movie but they play secondary characters, such as is the case with R. Lee Ermey and Forest Whitaker. The main parts are being played by some big unknowns, who aren't really charismatic or likable enough. A missed opportunity.A good, different version of the well known story.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damion Crowley's Review of Body Snatchers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Body Snatchers' (1993)is a moderate movie, with some decent scares, not quite held snugly together.The movie, in fact, comes across as a reasonably well made piece of fan-fiction. Amateurish, but enthusiastic and mostly fun, without too much ridiculousness.The title implies a sequel, and watching all three movies together, one could picture these stories occurring simultaneously across the country.The director is smart enough to know the boundaries of his FX about 95% of the time. The only time he really over-extends them is a critical dramatic moment, but only those seeking to poke holes in the movie will hammer on this.The acting overall is decent. Forrest Whitaker is the surprising weak link here, hamming it up to almost embarrassing levels. Meg Tilly is unremarkable, and Billy Wirth is stock hero. R. Lee Emery plays a toned-down version of his usual self. Gabrielle Anwar has the best lines, and the best overall performance. Terry Kinney does fairly well, as does Reily Murphy.This is a movie with an 80's mentality made in the 90's, including some gratuitous T &amp; A. Sort of a John Hughes meets Tom Savini. As a cheap rental or a bargain bin purchase, it is definitely worth considering, and will probably keep you reasonably well entertained through out.A six out of 10, or a 6.4 on the 100 point system.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Third best version (though I haven't seen the new one yet), but still undervalued</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third version of Jack Finney's novel is actually quite good, too. It sets the action in a military base, where a man from the EPA and his family have just arrived to do some tests. The protagonist of the film is the man's teenage daughter (played by the luminous Gabrielle Anwar). There's little set-up in this version. When it begins, the pods have already started to spread. This speeds up the proceedings. I might even complain that things happen too fast. The film is more action oriented ? which is especially proved in its hilarious final sequence. Let's just say that, unlike the other versions, which take place in urban areas, they have lots of big weapons at a military base. Despite this, the film is quite effective as horror. A lot of scenes are recycled, always intelligently, from the previous two films (love the take on the "I didn't tell you my name!" scene from the '78 version, as well as "You can fool them."). They also come up with some really good new ones, like the day care sequence, where the 6 year-old son of the EPA investigator figures out that something's going on. The direction in general is gorgeous. Some of the performances are a bit weak. I especially didn't care for Billy Wirth, the hero, who may be incredibly handsome, but he's handsome in a way that says: "I am a New Kids on the Block reject!" Recognizable faces include Forest Whitaker and R. Lee Ermey (who tends to pop up whenever a film needs authentic military-type persons), as well as Meg Tilly, who has the film's most memorable line. Undervalued.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do we really need a remake of a remake? Of course the question is no as we even don't need (in most cases) remakes, and from the moment it is a remake from a movie (Don Siegel) in where almost nothing has changed, the big question here is a big why... But they made it so we have to live with it. Abel Ferrera isn't exactly the best director ever (the only movie I really liked from him was the Harvey Keitel-movie Bad Luitenant) and he tried to do something special and in the end there is nothing special to see. It's just an alienmovie but it's not scary enough to be a horror, not sci-fi enough to be sci-fi and certainly not thrilling to be a thriller. It's just like grandma tells a story that you heard over and over and still I rated it two stars and a half. Why? Just don't ask me why, I just don't know it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ferrera's best film, and that's not meant as faint praise. By removing the political and social urgency of Siegel's original film, by avoiding the allegorical possibilities of the source in moving the threat away from Anytown USA to an army base, Ferrera frees the text from specificity, from abstracts, and forces us to confront the actual physical reality of the tale.It is about snatching bodies, not souls. The plot about people's identites being stolen, linked to their bodies, is thus appositely paralelled with Gabrielle Anwar's rites-of-passage story, as she moves from marginalised daughter to powerful, army-destroying woman - hers is a quest for self, defined against all sorts of conformities. Surprisingly, restraint, space and irony are to be found in abundance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Teenager Marti Malone (Gabrielle Anwar) and her family have to spend some time on a military base where her father has to do some testing. Unknown to them there are "pods" from outer space that take over humans. They look, sound and act alike...but there are no emotions. Marti and new boyfriend Tim Young (Billy Wirth) try to escape with their lives...and souls intact.This has gotten a lot of bad press. There are a lot of things wrong with this--all of the characters are either one-dimensional (Tim) or unlikable (everybody else). Marti and Tim fall in love instantly but have no charisma or sexual chemistry between them (their kiss has the be the most unromantic I've ever seen). Meg Tilly is also on hand giving another bad performance. But I've always liked this. True it's not as good as the original but I like it a lot more than the terrible 1978 remake. It's well-directed; Anwar and Wirth are easy on the eyes; Forest Whitaker gives an excellent performance in a small role; the special effects are good; there are a few very fun gross-out moments and Tilly's "where you gonna go" speech has become a minor classic. The studio threw this one away and it disappeared quickly but I think it's pretty good and worth catching. I give it a 7.</fullReview>
