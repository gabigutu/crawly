		<shortDescription>Whatever Happened to Simone Simon?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie, I can't understand why Simone Simon didn't become a great star. In this movie she's luminous on a level with Ingrid Bergman &amp; Audrey Hepburn. Watch the scene where Jimmy Stewart really look at her for the first time as she turns her face to his with the melody of 'Diane' playing softly; movie magic!She made two other well-known movies: Cat People &amp; Curse of the Cat People, then her career dwindled into nothingness. Perhaps if she'd had more charismatic co-stars like James Stewart to play off against. She should have been James Cagney's unrequited love in "The Roaring Twenties" instead of that insipid Priscilla Lane (or was it Rosemary Lane?)James Stewart is superb as Chico. He's awkward, gruff, reluctant to get involved with other people yet his core decency compels him prevent Diane's mistreatment and stop her suicide attempt. Stewart was probably that way in real life. I don't agree that he's miscast or that he should have a French accent. There are people like that in all countries. It's not about France or French people. Any urban setting like London, Rome, New York etc. would have done equally well.I found the character played by J. Edward Bromberg rather disturbing. He kept showing up to rain on Diane's parade with those strange eyes. I kept hoping Diane would give him a beating like she did to Gale Sonergaard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simone Simon and James Stewart work well together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simone Simon glowed. She was inspired by James Stewart's character. Her character was lit up by Chico whose pure innocence and positive attitude overshadowed any shortcomings of her character. Stewart came across so well that I could not stop watching the film even though he lacked a French accent. This movie must be seen by all of Jimmy Stewart's fans. It's as if Stewart's star quality is irrepressible. Its as if his personal good character comes across better than the script can tell;therefore,I can accept this story. I have to admit I have seen many of his movies before I saw this one, including many times "Its a Wonderful Life". But, in this film "Seventh Heaven" he allows Simone Simon to make the story work. The two actors are at their best in this old fashioned melodrama. This is a rare instance where the actors pulled the story to a much higher plain. Perhaps that is why it's called "Seventh Heaven".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chico, Diane, Heaven!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chico, a sewer worker in Paris rescues Diane, a prostitute, from the police. He not only offers his protection, but also his unending love. Diane, who up to that point had been abused by many people, suddenly realizes the love she receives from Chico lifts her from a dreary existence and helps her find her own voice. Alas, war intervenes at the time the couple decides to get married. Chico, an avowed atheist, invents his own wedding vows as he and Diane exchange chains to wear around their necks instead of the customary ring. Both make a promise to chant their names and pretend they are in heaven at 11am each day. The ritual keeps them hoping for an eventual happy life together in peaceful times. This 1937 release directed by Henry King, is seldom seen these days. The basic reason for watching it again is the sweet presence of Simone Simon and James Stewart. These two actors contributed to make the film much better than it should have been if played by others. Ms. Simon, one of the most beautiful faces in the French cinema, had a wonderful screen presence that works well opposite to the young and disarming James Stewart, at one of the best points of his budding career.Others in the cast included Jean Hersholt, who appears as the priest that tries to convert Chico. This is the same actor whose name is synonymous with worthwhile causes within the film industry and who died much to young to continue his humanitarian work. Also, Gregory Ratoff, Gale Sondergaard, Sig Ruman and J. Edward Bromberg and the rest do great work in the film.The copy shown on cable was not exactly the best, but as in other memorable films, what matters is the story and the great performances that Henry King got from everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A unique film - strangely haunting. Beautiful sets. I thought about this film for a long time after first seeing it. I've never seen another film quite like it. The story was very sweet, but also compelling, and unpredictable. I was frequently surprised by the plot which held my attention from beginning to end. Excellent acting and memorable characters.

		<shortDescription>Superlative version of the play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very moving and excellent movie version of the Seventh Heaven play that was the "talkie" remake of the silent version made 10 years earlier. James Stewart (Chico) and Simone Simon (Diane) play the street cleaner and prostitute whose paths cross and develop a special bond with each other. The movie presents a much gritty view of life in the 1914 Paris streets before World War I and has so many deep messages about life. The Chico character is an atheist who became cynical when his prayers were not answered. He helps Diane when she is beaten by her prostitute sister for not being sociable with potential clients. To prevent her from being arrested, Chico takes her in as his wife to live in his apartment. The climb is up 7 flights of steps, but the apartment becomes their own heavenly abode. As their feelings deepen between the two, Chico eventually proposes marriage to Diane. However, World War I intervenes and Chico must leave Diane to go to war. The two vow to think about each other at 11 AM every day. As the war comes to a close, Chico is injured in a gas attack and is reported to have died by his comrades and a priest (Jean Hersholt whose name is attached to the Humanitarian Academy Award given out every year during the Oscar award show). Another injured war veteran also is introduced during the time that Diane is working in the war hospital and appears to be the "other man" character who tries to win her over. As the end of the war is imminent, Diane refuses to believe that Chico was killed in the war. She, in turn, almost becomes an atheist when she feels that God could have let him die and to have abandoned her. She receives another revelation at 11 AM on November 11, 1918 as the armistice news is celebrated and races back to climb up the seven flight of stairs past all of the revelers to get back to her home. The ending of the movie could have been with a sad ending. But even if it did, the love that tied the two of them would still have resonated strongly at the end. Chico had given Diane a new outlook on life and she could have carried on in the future for the both of them.The movie had many closeups of Simone with the type of lighting that you would expect to showcase her beauty. It looked like you were seeing a photographer shifting the lights in the background when a closeup was called for. She has such an angelic face. Jimmy Stewart may have not fit the French sanitary worker role exactly since he spoke with no French accent. But, his acting fit the role of the street cleaner perfectly and you could see how his later movie roles in "Shop Around the Corner" and "It's a Wonderful Life" were an extension of his role in this movie.The movie was made just two years before World War II began. It showed the horror of battle in the trenches and is a sad reminder of the upcoming war that would soon envelop Europe again.This movie version provides many simple messages about life in general and also affirms the daily life struggles of the lower classes. Everyone has their own heaven if they look hard for it. Sometimes you have to look deep into your own heart. The most poignant scene in the movie for me is right after the policeman comes to visit Chico's apartment to verify his story that Diane and he were married. After he is satisfied when checking the apartment and leaves, Diane then knows that the charade about being married is over and that it is time for her to leave. She tidies up the kitchen area one more time and then takes a last look at the room as she heads out the door. Priceless moment. Highly recommended even though it is a little known movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stars to adorn Seventh Heaven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a younger Jimmy Stewart fan, I of course am prone to relish in his early works because of how dashing and handsome he was. Just like any other Jimmy Stewart film, you will not be disappointed and if you do not like the movie in all its entirety you will definitely find something that you did like to take with you. Seventh Heaven turned out to be exactly what I expected from the title. Simone Simon was beautiful and wonderful in her role and Jimmy Stewart was charming and endearing as always. It is true that this film is dated...it was made in 1936 but the message it carries of true love will remain timeless. It was very uplifting and if you are a Jimmy Stewart fan esp. of his romances from earlier years this is a great, seven star film to watch. It will give you a great dose of Jimmy Stewart and a good sprinkle of faith to believe that true love does indeed conquer all.</fullReview>

It was uplifting because bravery and heaven were big in this movie. "Chico, Diane, Heaven" for example. That phrase kept me hanging on. Their bravery helped them achieve their heaven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has stuck with me since seeing it late at night on television 26 years ago. I became a Simon Simone fan and was already a Jimmy Stewart fan. An up lifting story showing that even the seemingly lowest people on the social scale can be courageous, serve a higher purpose, overcome hardships and past mistakes, and have a happy life shared with a true love. I have to admit to being a sucker for these types of movies though. This movie is similar to Cannery Row (Nick Nolte and Debra Winger) and The World Of Suzie Wong (William Holden and Nancy Kwan). I have never been able to find this movie showing on television since or on DVD or VHA. Wish I could find this one on DVD or VHS since I would love to share watching it with my wife.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I preferred the silent version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's nothing really wrong with this movie. And there are some positive things.On both the positive and the negative side is French actress Simone Simon. She is radiantly beautiful throughout the movie. When she appears at the window in her wedding gown, you truly believe you are seeing an angel. But her command of English is so limited, and the dialog for her often so weak, that she isn't able to make much of an impression as an actress. When she chases Gale Sondergaard out of the room with a belt in a reversal of a scene early in the movie, she doesn't convey any anger, or triumph. She's good at smiling radiantly, but that's about it.Steward does his usual fine job, but again, he has a poor script to work with.Gale Sondegaard gives perhaps the most vivid characterization in the movie as the evil sister. She is truly terrifying, an actress who could do so many very different things all very well.Too often, though, the script sinks, or comes close to sinking, this picture.I much preferred the 1927 silent. I'm no great fan of silent movies, but that one is astoundingly beautiful and very deeply moving, perhaps because there is no weak script to get in the way, perhaps because certain of the scenes are just filmed better, such as the first night "together" of Chico and Diane in his seventh-floor apartment, the 7th heaven of the title.Even if you don't generally care for silent pictures, give the 1927 version a try.Meanwhile, this one is fine for one viewing, but I doubt I'll watch it again.--------------------Actually, I did watch it again - though it took two sessions to get through it. I still agree with everything I wrote before, though I will add one thing: Especially in the early parts of the movie, there is some beautiful camera work, old-fashioned close-ups and effective shots of the staircase that keeps twisting and turning as it rises to that 7th heaven. The director, Henry King, had made a lot of movies in the silent era, and he knew how to film light and shadow poetically. It doesn't save the movie, but it's worth noticing if you decide to sit through this disappointing movie anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with the previous review. I've only seen this movie once but it has stuck with me. This is a movie about a sewer worker (a very young Jimmy Stewart) who aspires to work as a street sweeper. This is the epitome of jobs in his viewpoint. He is determined to achieve this goal as he considers himself "quite a remarkable fellow". He also falls in love with a young woman who is entranced with this remarkable fellow. He eventually achieves both of his goals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Diane And Chico</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Stewart's first film assignment for 1937 was a loan out from MGM to 20th Century Fox for a remake of their silent classic Seventh Heaven that starred Charles Farrell and Janet Gaynor and won for Gaynor the first Best Actress Oscar. Based on a play by Austin Strong that ran for 704 performances on Broadway during the 1922-24 season, the silent film also boasted the classic film theme Diane which was one of the biggest selling instrumental recordings during the Twenties.The Diane theme was retained for the sound version, the movie-going public would have not paid a nickel to see this film if it were otherwise. In keeping with the French location of the film, French import Simone Simon took Janet Gaynor's place and gave a luminescent performance. But why Darryl F. Zanuck couldn't get Charles Boyer for the male lead is beyond me. If I had been Zanuck I'd have waited until Boyer was available. He would have been perfect for the role. The very American James Stewart, try though he does, just doesn't cut it as the French sewer worker Chico. Even Zanuck's two best male contract players, Don Ameche and Tyrone Power, would also have been better than Stewart.The plot is essentially the same with sewer worker Chico rescuing Diane after she's been thrown out of a brothel managed by her sister Gale Sondergaard. Simone's heart just is not in the job of sex worker. Sondergaard gives one her patented bad girl performances, she really has some bite in her role. Also to be noted is Jean Hersholt in the role of sympathetic priest.The sound version of Seventh Heaven might have been a classic had a player who was French or one who was cast as foreign types been in the lead. Jimmy must have wondered what he was doing in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miss Simone's stand-in and double</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My mother, whose stage name was Donnie Gay, was an actress in the 1930's and early 1940's, and was Simone Simone's stand-in and double. So, in "7th Heaven", when the Diane character is getting slapped around and otherwise disrespected, that was my Mother. They were both indeed beautiful women. They lost touch after WW II began, and my parents left Hollywood for the war effort. I did do some research some time back, and I believe that Miss Simone returned to France in the 1960's, I believe, and died there in the 1980's or the 1990's. I wouldn't swear to this: it's been a few years since I did this research, and those papers were probably lost in a house fire in 2002. At the time "7th Heaven" was made, my Mother was still married to her first husband, Charles Hansen, who ran a dance studio in Hollywood similar to Arthur Murray. In fact, I believe the dance studio was still in existence in the 1970's or 1980's. For what it's worth, my Mother passed away right before Christmas in 1980. I will check to see if I still have a copy of the research that I did on Miss Simone.-HWM</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie Made In Heaven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This motion picture can now be seen at a well known website, and I just viewed it for the first time yesterday evening, and ... Now, firstly, how can anyone say that Jimmy Stewart was miscast? I thought that both Jimmy Stewart and Simone Simon were perfect. By the way, your website notes the circumstances as to how her father died, and after leaving behind such a wonderful daughter, he did not die in vain. Next, as Diane shows an evidently avid interest in the kitchen, some might now say that might be somewhat out of date - you know, not exactly a power situation. Well, there are still a number of good guys out there, and if they ever had a chance to meet someone like Diane, no matter what she asked, they wouldn't even dream of saying no. How's that for a power situation?Some reviewers also misunderstand who Diane was while she was under her sister's rule. For example, when Sig Rumann merely tried to offer a kiss, look what happened. Continuing, I also note that in real life, Simone Simon never married, and I wouldn't be surprised if this reflects her role in this movie - an angel and a saint. Finally, this motion picture didn't receive a hint of the recognition that it so richly deserved when it came out, and I wonder why?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that shows what true love is really about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't describe how much of an effect this film had on me. I thought, before taking a chance, "ah...a minor Jimmy Stewart effort"...wow was I wrong. This film is Simone Simon's from start to finish.The film comes from a Romance play with hints of Socialism/Communism before the 1st World War taking place in Paris. Chico is a sewer cleaner/street sweeper and Diane is a poor girl who's sister treats her like property. Her sister beats her in the streets one day publicly and Chico saves her. He takes her in and there's just no possible way he can't love her by the end. She entrances him with her shyness and willingness to love and he's hooked...but...WWI steps in. From this point on you should see what true love is and should be. It's a magical little film.For a fleeting time there was a rage on about Simone Simon. In the late 30's to early 40's she was a wanted actress by the studios and I can see why. If she's not the most adorable actress in film history I don't know who was...('cept maybe Shirley Temple). Watching this you'll wanna take her home and take care of her the rest of her life. Every guy in the world has a dream he always keeps before he settles down and the dream is always this..."I want a girl who's beautiful inside and out and doesn't know it...one who's not pretentious".. Simone Simon fills the bill in this film....big time.If your not crying throughout this film you might want to use some eye drops to establish some semblance of tears cause you'll need em. A really wonderful film. Can't recommend it any higher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So that's where the song "Diane" came from</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a Love story among members of the Poor People of Paris, where Jimmy Stewart plays a working class sewer worker. Given his lot in life, Stewart's character expresses little faith in God, but after he befriends an abused prostitute (Diane), in her he finds the catalyst for an improved prospective on life. This symbolizes the potential power of positive relationships. This is a remake of the silent film of the same name from 10 years earlier that won three Academy awards, including one for Janet Gaynor for best actress.Interesting of note is the romantic music theme "Diane" which plays throughout the film. Although the tune was written in 1927 for the original silent movie version of this film, most today will remember it from the pop hit the Irish group 'The Bachelors' had in 1964. Singer Billy Daniels had actually previously made the tune popular in the 1940's, when he made it his #1 song to sing on his NY radio broadcasts. Jazz trumpeter Miles Davis was later perceptive enough to have recorded the tune with John Coltrane on his classic 1956 album "Steamin' with the Miles Davis Quintet." The lyrics are never heard in the film, but a review of the lyrics find them spot-on with the story: "I'm in Heaven when I see you smile; smile for me my Diane. And though everything is dark all the while; I can see you Diane. You have lighted the road leading home; Pray for me when you can. For no matter wherever I roam; Smile for me my Diane."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even if Jimmy Stewart hadn't yet established his wonderful screen persona, this film was 1000% wrong for him!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1927 film, "Seventh Heaven", starred Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell. Had it been a talking picture, they would have been all wrong for the parts--with their very American accents. But, the public didn't need to hear them playing Parisians and the film worked...and helped lead to Gaynor receiving the Best Picture Oscar. However, when it was remade in 1937, some dunderhead thought casting Jimmy Stewart as a French Atheist was a GOOD idea!!! Now I'll admit that Stewart hadn't yet fully developed him 'Aww, shucks' persona (and even played a villain in a couple of his early films), he was so dreadfully wrong for this film. His accent, his manner, his meanness, his looks--all so very wrong! That's almost as bad as John Wayne playing Genghis Khan in "The Conquerer"! On the plus side, at least Simone Simon was a good choice for the other lead--though her strong natural French accent served to make Stewart's lack of one all the more apparent! The film begins in a poor section of Paris among the lowest of the low. Stewart works in the sewers (sort of a French Ed Norton) and Simon plays a virgin who works in a whore house!! After she is beaten by the Madame because she won't put out, Stewart comes to her rescue. But, when the police want to charge her as a 'professional girl', Stewart lies and tells them she is his wife. And, to make sure they don't discover he's lying, she moves into his loft apartment. While they are together purely by circumstances, you KNOW that eventually they will be head-over-heels in love...it's obvious and inevitable.The plot is a bit silly and the film seems very awkward. Some may find it romantic or fun--I just thought it was obvious, poorly cast and in need of a re-write. Not among Stewart's or Simon's finer moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chico and the Girl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SEVENTH HEAVEN (20th Century-Fox, 1937), directed by Henry King, is a sentimental love story of two ordinary but unlikely people in the poor district of Paris. Originated on stage in 1922 before becoming a popular 1927 silent screen Fox Film adaptation starring Janet Gaynor, directed by Frank Borzage, Gaynor's performance won her the first Academy Award ever awarded to an actress. It also marked Gaynor's initial teaming opposite Charles Farrell, with SEVENTH HEAVEN the most associated of their twelve collaborations together. Basically following the same pattern as the 1927 carnation, this new edition not only borrows heavily on the underscoring to the "Seventh Heaven" theme song, but makes every effort by using a new assortment of actors to physically resemble those from the original cast, particularly its leading players consisting of Simone Simon resembling Gaynor in both pint size and hairstyle, and James Stewart matching Farrell's height and straight-forward manner. While this latest SEVENTH HEAVEN benefits with the use of sound, history did not repeat itself with at least an Academy Award nomination for Henry King as Best Director and/or Simone Simon (best known as Irene in Val Lewton's RKO Radio 1942 classic, CAT PEOPLE) as Best Actress.Plot Summary: "Paris, 1914. On the lower left slope of Montmarte Hill lies the sinister square called 'The Sock.' Its wretched inhabitants, crowded like rats, live between Heaven and Hell. For their evil street is stopped suddenly by a church.". Chico (James Stewart), who addresses himself as a "remarkable fellow," is a sewer worker. He is also an "athiest" working by a nearby church. Down the road is the Cafe De Trou Dans Le Sac run by Nana (Gale Sondergaard) who uses her younger sister, Diane (Simone Simon) to entice and entertain men to keep the place open. Because Durand (Sig Rumann), one of the customers, forces himself on her, Diane breaks away by throwing wine in his face. After Durand threatens to close the place, Nana forces her anger on Diane by running after and whipping her continuously down the streets until breaking down unconsciously. She is then saved from further beating by Chico who chases Nana away. Diane's attempt to kill herself with Chico's knife fails as he intervenes in saving her life again. As Diane is about to be arrested, Chico steps in once again by telling the officer that she is "his wife." Knowing the suspecting policeman will be checking out his story, Chico allows Diane to move into his seventh floor walk up flat acting as his wife until the officer arrives to see his story is "true." During the course of time, Chico becomes a man of position of street washer while Diane gains confidence in herself, losing all fear she once had. Love soon takes its toll, but before they can get married, war is declared, leading to a lengthy separation and unexpected occurrences.Other than Simon and Stewart, SEVENTH HEAVEN features an assortment of capable players including Jean Hersholt as a good natured priest; John Qualen as the buck-tooth thief called the "Sewer Rat"; Thomas Beck as Brissac, a young soldier; Victor Kilian as Gobin, Chico's street cleaning neighbor, with Mady Christians Marie, Gobin's wife; and Gregory Ratoff. Gale Sondergaard makes an impressive wicked sister, a role originated on the silent screen by Gladys Brockwell.Having Simone Simon the same nationality as Diane benefits greatly, though the casting of James Stewart, on loan out assignment from his home studio of MGM, appears to be a case of miscasting. Although he does his best with in his performance, Stewart doesn't seem to be suitable in the role. Had Stewart's character been explained as an American taking up residence in France might have helped, but to accept him as someone named Chico does not. Fortunately Stewart makes no attempt in using a French accent or any sort of accent in this French setting. Charles Boyer might have worked, but his advanced age might have made his performance opposite the youthful Simon quite awkward, though casting of this very nature had been done numerous times. 20th Fox's own Tyrone Power seems the logical choice, but sources claim he was on loan to MGM in exchange for Stewart to co-star opposite Norma Shearer in the epic, MARIE ANTOINETTE (1938).Basically a scene by scene remake, with few alterations and shortening of specific ones, resulting to 100 minutes over the original's two hours, SEVENTH HEAVEN wouldn't be the same without the tender moment during the war sequence having Diane and Chico communicate daily silently to each other from their hearts, wherever they are. On a personal level, the reproduction sets of Paris is first rate while Henry King's direction keeps the pace moving. Only its closing minutes which could have been handled differently, doesn't seem to ring true to life.For anyone who's seen the original SEVENTH HEAVEN would no doubt watch this edition for comparison. Those who have never seen the original would simply accept this SEVENTH HEAVEN for what it is, judging for themselves whether or not this rarely seen love story holds up whenever it turns up on the Fox Movie Channel.
