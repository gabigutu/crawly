		<fullReview>I can never forget this film. Unlike some critics, me and my mates found Robert Evans' performance mesmerising. In '58, it was our first experience of a horror-western and for us it worked very well. I'm not saying it's a truly great film, just that it was so radically different at the time that it remains one of my most memorable films of the 50s.In the East-End of London, in the mid to late 50s, we teens were hooked on Americana. We knew and liked Hugh O'Brian as Wyatt Earp in the TV series. Robert Evans was new to us and a revelation. We liked his look and his style; his performance fitted well with Rock 'n Roll, James Dean and the whole 'cool' American thing.Fortunately, although in the UK, I have a recorder which plays NTSC tapes. I will be buying this film soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must confess that I saw this movie an awful long time ago, when I was just a kid. However, it made a big impression on me and it blended genres in a way that I hadn't ever seen a film before. The story sort of reminds me of "Psycho," but set in the old west, and to a lesser degree, set in some deserted shipyards and other industrial locations. Anyhow, ever since I've been dying to see it again. Filmed in beautifully harsh and stark black and white.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very unusual and interesting western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much of this film will seem familiar to anyone who's seen 1947's "Kiss of Death", which plotwise it closely resembles, and some of the theme music heard over the opening credits was borrowed from 1951's "The Day The Earth Stood Still". That having been said, however, this film has much to recommend it on its own. Most critics disapproved of Robert Evans in the title role, but I found him very impressive: funny and likeable one minute, menacing and really frightening the next; the stuff of any true psycho. The film isn't without flaws; the direction is frankly uninspired, and several opportunities missed. But Evans (in one of his last roles before giving up acting to become a producer) remains fascinating to watch; he's very unlike any other western villain you've ever seen. Emile Meyer (as a brutal prison guard) and Stephen McNally (as a good guy for a change) offer strong supporting performances; Hugh O'Brien is his reliable self as the hero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this film for the first time since 1958, and it's much better than I thought it was when I was a 12-year-old. It's fast-paced even at 101 minutes, more violent than I remembered, and consistently well played. I find Robert Evans chillingly credible as psychotic killer Felix Griffin -- perhaps closer to Peter Ustinov's Nero in "Quo Vadis" than to Richard Widmark's Tommy Udo in "Kiss of Death" (on which this film is based), but certainly not "ludicrous," as one critic whose opinions I respect has written. Hugh O'Brian and Stephen McNally also deliver strong performances, and the rest of the cast is fine. Recommended for fans of Westerns and brutal crime films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good western, misleading title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I avoided seeing this film during years because of the title which made me think it was a horror one like "Jesse James meets Frankenstein's daughter". Finally I saw it and liked it. Gordon Douglas is no John Ford but was quite efficient in directing westerns like "Only the Valiant " and "The Great Missouri Raid". Robert Evans' performance was very controversial with the critics, but I think he came out very well. He already proved he was a good actor in "The Sun Also Rises" and here as Felix Griffin he overacts, but then this character must be overacted, that is the only way to play him. Hugh O'Brian is the bad good guy Dan Hardy who has the misfortune of falling into the list of victims of Griffin, who is as cruel and crazy as one can be. There is a lot of suspense, action and once you start watching this western, it will keep you on the edge until the end. It is unfortunate that they chose such a misleading title that must have done a lot of harm at the box office and also not letting the film be as known as it deserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SOME QUOTES FROM MEMORY: Griffin - "Say - do you know what I heard in the Kitchen? Sidell died, about an hour ago." Dan- "Oh. Find out what it was?" Griffin - "Something he ate. Anybody that gobbles food down the way he done, they never know what they're shoveling down their gullets until it's too late!" Dan - "Oh." Griffin - "Sad ain't it!" Later before Griffin leaves jail. Hardy - "Ames" Ames - "Mister Ames!" Hardy - "Mister Ames." Ames - "Next time you wanna know something, be respectful." Hardy - "Ames! Ames! Oh when I break out of here the first thing I'm going to do is get that Ames and beat him down!" Griffin - "You know Sadman. You don't sound like the same fellow that came in here six weeks ago!" Hardy - "I'm not!" Griffin - "I'd love to stay here with you but I've got a living to make. You know they're paying a lot of money for Indian scalps!" Hardy - "You ever collected many, huh?" Griffin - "Lots of them since I came out west, sometimes more than even just a scalp!" Hardy - "Like a whole girl eh, like you had before." Griffin - "Yea. All in one piece! You know I wish I could do you a favor Sadman. I wish I could bring one in here to keep you company." Hardy - "There's only one woman I wanna see. See her in the flesh. Real! As I see here in my head all the day and all of the night. Ten years! Ten years wasn't going to mean a thing to me! Only one month since I've been here, I'm likely to go loco worried about her not knowing whether she's had the baby. Not knowing whether they're taking car of her not knowing?" Griffin butting in sarcastically - "Don't upset yourself Sadman. Why, you might as well get used to the idea that this, this wife of yours has, has moved in with some other guy. Because that's what she is going to do if she hasn't done it already!" Hardy - "I love her!" Griffin - "She's no princess!" Big punch up occurs. Ames - "Oh let him go! Let him go, back off. That's no way to say Goodbye!" Hardy - "Don't know what got into me." Griffin (panting) - "Feel the same way myself sometimes! You know Sadman, if there is anything I can do to make you rest easier I'll go out of my way to do it!" Dan - "No Thanks, I'll manage." Ames - "Oh Hardy about the mail, they tell me all the stamps in Washington got burnt up! Ain't going to be no mail, never again, too bad eh, shove it over! Come on Griffin." Griffin finishing up - "I'll be with you in a minute sir." I'd like to leave you something to remember me by.You know that little animal of mine? (glass horse), gave me lots of pleasure." Dan - "If it would make you feel any better leave it!" Griffin - "I would of liked to but I can't." Dan -"Why not?" Griffin - "Sidell, he ate it! Ha haw ha ha haw haw." END SCENE. After Dan breaks out of jail and goes to Griffin's house: Griffin -" May there's someone out there, who do you think it is?" May - "I don't hear nothing." May -"Nobody!" (Loud Knocking) Griffin - "You'd better learn to believe me Little Miss May! Open the door." Dan enters house. Griffin - "Well if it isn't my old friend huh!" Dan - "Hello Griffin I broke out." Griffin - "Good, good, never thought you had it in you. Come on sit down Sadman. Sit down! Little Miss May I got myself a guest. How about a bottle and two glasses huh? There you are. Drink up Sadman.Drink up." Dan - "Tastes funny after so long." Griffin - "You'll get used to it again." So you broke out of old Fort Smith did ya? Kill anyone doing it?" Dan - "No. But I gave Ames something to remember though!" Griffin - "Yea I bet you did. You're good at that Sadman!" What are you going to do now Sadman? See my wife. When are you planning on seeing her? I don't know they'll be watching my place all the time, waiting for me to come and get her. I wouldn't worry about them watching your place Sadman. Why not? Well they'll be using all the men they can get for couple a Emmett and Dyer. Somebody kill Emmett and Dyer? Yeah. They was bush-whacked and the horses ran off with a wagon-load of prisoners. They must have been a mighty sore tailed crowd, the horses hightailed it all the way back to Fort Smith! That's a long haul, a long haul! Yeah I know I just made it. Yeah you look kinda tired Sadman. I think you'll be needing some sleep. Come on I'll show you where to lie down huh. Here you are! Just throw yourself down eh, don't even bother to take your boots off! Lie down lie down go on. I'll be seeing you in the morning Sadman, I got some things to do. Goodnight! (Griffin closes the door.) May, May! What are you doing in the shed?" May - I was just cleaning up that's all." Griffin - My old friend's using the bedroom if you wanna sleep do it out here." May - "What if he wakes up and wants something?" Griffin - "If you can't hear him he won't get it will he?" END SCENE. After Dan's wife storms out: Griffin - "There she goes! And here she comes! Come over here Miss May. Pull up a chair, sit right with us huh, right next to me come on! Now we can all have some fun." Dan - "Had a tumble Mam?" Griffin - "Little Miss May - fell off a horse, tut tut!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Torpedoed by a crass central performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a minor tradition of remaking crime movies for the Western genre."The Badlanders"is a retread of "The Asphalt Jungle"while "Colorado Territory"is a remake of "High Sierra"."The Fiend Who Walked The West"is "Kiss of Death"in Western clothing and is almost a splendid movie.Hugh OBrian is "Daniel Slade Hardy" a decent gangster/outlaw who wants to go straight and turns to criminality only to keep his family fed.While in prison he confides in his deranged cellmate "Felix Griffin"the location of a cache of stolen money.Griffin on release tracks down and kills one of the robbers and slays his mother before terrorising Hardy's wife.Hardy is set free-in the guise of an escape-to bring the now out of control Griffin to justiceThe problem is not the script,direction(by the under-rated Gordon Douglas)or the acting by seasoned performers like OBrian and McNally(playing the sympathetic lawman but a performance of utter inadequacy by Robert Evans as Griffin.Where Richard Widmark in the original induced fear and loathing all that Evans evokes is a desire to laugh.Pouting prettily and assuming sub James Dean stances does not constitute acting and merely suggests a poor imitation of an poor actor.(The influence of James Dean on screen acting was wholly negative)If your villain comes over as a pouting pretty boy who needs a sound spanking then your movie is in troubleIts atmospheric,violent for its day and all the ingredients bar one -a credible actor in the pivotal role are in place.This lack mars the whole piece</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inferior Remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what the producers had in mind, if anything, when they framed this Western. The title, "The Fiend Who Walked The West" sounds like a science fiction or horror movie. So does the background behind the opening credits: a silhouette of what appears to be Nosferatu, the vampire. And the music is from Herrmann's score for "The Day The Earth Stood Still." All of that -- whatever its intent -- could be disregarded if the movie were in any way original, but it isn't. It's a cold-blooded remake of the peerless noir tale, "Kiss of Death." Even THAT could be disregarded if it were any good but it's inferior in every respect. In the part of Victor Mature, the put-upon and manipulated felon, we have Hugh O'Brian. He struts when he walks, his hips thrust forward, and when he's on screen all I could think of was that he resembled a more than usually supple totem pole. The guy has had a long career on film and TV. He was in "Twins" in 1988, and he STILL looked handsome and fit. There's no excuse for that.And in the Richard Widmark part, the giggling murderer, we have baby-faced Robert Evans, later His Excellency Robert Evans, producer of such classics as "Chinatown." Evans has been excoriated for his performance, but it's not that terrible. It's that Widmark was incomparable. Widmark created an integrated personality that was cynical and sadistic, whereas Evans comes across as consistently weird. If Widmark insulted his women in public, Evans beats them to death. Add that Hollywood has greased Evans' hair and slicked it back. It has such a sheen to it that one feels it might glow in the dark. I can find no fault with the Argentine-born Linda Crystal. Who could? She's not as virginal as Colleen Gray in the original, but she's extremely appealing, both as a woman and an actress. Joe MacDonald's photography is at least up to par, which is saying a lot. He was pretty good.The film ought to be judged on its own, I realize, but even so it's confusing and vague in its motivations and character. For instance, I don't know how Evans is able to figure out that O'Brien's escape from prison was a fake. He intuits it. It's especially disappointing because Harry Brown had a hand in writing the screenplay. He was a published poet and novelist ("A Walk in the Sun") and won an Academy Award for "A Place in the Sun." There is no moral difficulty either. The good guys are good and the bad guys are bad. And a typical Hollywood ending is imposed on the story. It lacks all nuance. There is no scene that equals that in the original when Brian Donlevy, as the DA, cons convict Victor Mature into cooperating by comparing photos of their children. Showing the kids is part of a subtle scam to get Mature to be a snitch. In "The Fiend Who Walked the West," on the other hand, the sheriff, Stephen O'Malley, is on the side of the angels and nobody gets a chance to say to him with an arid smile, "Your side of the law is just as dirty as ours."</fullReview>
