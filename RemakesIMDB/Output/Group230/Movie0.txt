		<shortDescription>A Shocking Screen Debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Widmark belongs to a select few players who from their screen debut became instant stars. No bit parts, no walk-ons, Widmark's first feature role netted him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and stardom.Widmark's portrayal of Tommy Udo in Kiss of Death shocked audiences nationwide. When Widmark tied up Mildred Dunnock and threw her down a flight of stairs, gasps aplenty came from audiences. That maniacal giggle became his trademark and fodder for impressionists from then on in. Widmark in fact had to really convince his bosses at 20th Century Fox that he was capable of more than being a psychopathic killer.Widmark was fourth billed in this film and so dominates it that it's forgotten that Victor Mature is the lead and contributes a good performance in his own right. Mature is a career criminal who was left holding the bag for his associates during a jewel heist. He refuses to rat them out and gets a stretch in prison for it. By his refusal to be a stoolie, Mature gains the friendship of Widmark who has a special hatred for the breed.Things then go bad for Mature when his wife commits suicide and his two little daughters wind up in an orphanage. At that point he rethinks becoming a stoolie for District Attorney Brian Donlevy and the main action of the film begins.Mature gives a very good performance of a man running out of options. He's caught between concern for his family and living up to the honor system that criminals have among themselves. Brian Donlevy, usually a villain, does a good job as the District Attorney.One other performance is worthy of note. Though he only has a few scenes, criminal defense attorney Taylor Holmes is also a real stand out. His Earle Houser is definitely one of the sleaziest lawyers ever portrayed on the screen. For all the many good performances Richard Widmark has given in his 91 years, his debut film turned out to be the only time he was ever nominated for an Oscar. That's a shame because I could think of a couple of other films like Night and the City, Pickup on South Street and Panic in the Streets that would have been worthy of consideration. Hopefully the American Film Institute will give Widmark a Lifetime Achievement Award and soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tale Of Two Crooks - One With A Heart, One Without One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a 1940s film noir with a little bit different slant: the main character "Nick Bianco" (Victor Mature) being a caring father. Here's a guy torn between being a crook most of his life and the damage it did to him mentally, but at heart a real softie who is desperate to go straight and just be a regular family guy with everyone leaving him alone. In the story, he turns "stoolie" so he can earn that freedom and be that family man.Among film noir buffs, however, this film is noted more for Richard Widmark's debut as the sadistic "Tommy Udo." One of the most famous noir scenes of all time is "Udo" throwing an old lady in a wheelchair down a flight of stairs! Widmark puts on a fake pair of choppers giving him an exaggerated overbite to go along with his insane little giggle. He also calls everyone a "squirt." His over- the-top performance puts a lot a spark into this film which, otherwise would have wound up more as a melodrama.Two other actors have key roles in here: Brian Donlevy and Colleen Gray (making her credited film debut, too1). Donlevey plays a character who never see in modern-day films: a compassionate district attorney who goes out of his way to help "Nick." It's refreshing to see, for a change. Gray becomes Nick's love interest and is a very appealing wholesome type, as are the two sweet little girls Nick had with his former wife who killed herself while Nick was in prison. Gray becomes the step-mother.Although not spectacular, the film is entertaining, especially the suspenseful last 20 minutes. It's quite dated in spots but Widmark's character alone is worth investigating this film if you've never seen it. I'm surprised there aren't more reviews of this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kiss of Death was an engaging and suspenseful film noir thriller. Standout performances were delivered from Victor Mature and Richard Widmark among others. Widmark as the sadistic Udo had a particularly memorable turn. This film actually reminded me quite a bit of the Humphrey Bogart film, The Enforcer, at least the first twenty minutes of that equally good crime drama. In both movies, the turning of evidence by witnesses for the state and their protection figure prominently. Unfortunately, the witness in The Enforcer isn't as lucky as Nick Bianco. One other note: the great Karl Malden has a small role in this film as a junior detective. Both Kiss of Death and The Enforcer get a solid 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense Noir Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Henry Hathaway does a bang-up job directing this taut, realistic gangster noir. With the exception of a couple of domestic scenes with Mature and his family, this film never lets up. In one of the most unique film debuts, Richard Widmark steals the show with his portrayal of the giggling, psychopathic killer Tommy Udo. There is no doubt about who is the star of this movie. Victor Mature gives a fine performance as the basically decent guy who turns "stoolie" and for whom you have sympathy and the rest of the cast is strong in support.....but it is Widmark who mesmerizes you with his performance. The oft cited senseless violence of the "wheelchair pushed down the stair" scene is still one that makes you turn away. The real life New York City setting adds more realism and the black and white cinematography is excellent, capturing shadows which foretell the violence that is coming. Look for Karl Malden in a small part, early in his career. This is a classic of the noir genre and should be added to your film library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good crime drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is "required reading" in the study of gangster films, mostly because of Richard Widmark's exceptional and truly frightening performance as Tommy Udo. Interestingly enough, 43 years later, actor Joe Pesci would also terrify movie audiences with his portrayal of another psychopathic gangster, who also had the rather benign name of 'Tommy'. However, unlike Pesci, Widmark never had another particularly memorable gangster role after this one.While a lot of the story is realistic, some of it is far-fetched - mainly, the end. Only a complete lunatic would even think of walking into the headquarters of a gangster that he had just testified against and expect to come out alive. However, the tension in that restaurant confrontation scene is effective, and I suppose for the era in which this film was made, it was necessary to have the 'good hero' face down the 'bad bully' and put him in his place. In reality, of course, it just doesn't happen that way in the world of crime.But what makes this film is Widmark, and to give an idea of just how effective he was, when this film first came out, a real-life NYC mobster(Joey Gallo) would watch it and earnestly try to imitate Widmark's style and mannerisms, thereby enhancing his own skill in intimidating others. As they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vic and Dick In Old Manhattan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the better remembered crime films of the forties, and boasts excellent direction by Henry Hathaway, a good script by Ben Hecht and Charles Lederer, and fine New York location photography by Norbert Brodine. Victor Mature plays a small-time crook who's enlisted by an assistant D.A. to infiltrate a gang of criminals whose leader, played by Richard Widmark, in his movie debut, is a psychopath with a very bent sense of humor. Psycho killers were relatively new to movies in the forties, and Widmark's may be the most famous of the lot. One can see his influence in films for years to come, as any number of actors made their debuts playing similar roles. No one surpassed Widmark for sheer sadism, however, as when he ties up an old lady in a wheelchair and sends her tumbling down a flight of stairs. This remains his most famous role, and when his obituary is written, the author, if he knows his movies at all, will mention it in the first sentence. Kiss Of Death is a decent crime story, at times very tense, but not otherwise exceptional. Surprisingly, Victor Mature gives a warm, emotional performance in the leading role, and Widmark's villainy would not have been so nearly as effective without this. How dull this picture might have been had Dana Andrews or Mark Stevens played this part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Widmark as a giggling, heartless hoodlum pushing a wheelchair bound old lady down the stairs, that's what everyone remembers of this superb classic. The film follows luckless Nick Bianco (Victor Mature's best role), a NYC holdup man who is caught during an Xmas season hit. Sent to prison, he needs to be near his now parentless children (His wife committed suicide). He becomes an informant, and is released. Widmark, as hoodlum Tommy Udo (All film fans have no trouble remembering that name) targets stoolie Mature for death. The film begins (with the failed robbery) and ends (the showdown between Widmark, Mature and DA Brian Donlevy) with superb suspense sequenses played almost silent.</fullReview>

He switches emotions in a heartbeat! EERIE! Victure Mature is really the star of this movie &amp; he looks GREAT in every scene! Those crisp suits &amp; those hats! When he has to turn informant so his now-motherless kids can have him back at home instead of in "the big house", Udo goes after him with a vengeance. The tension between these two is combustible! I LOVE this film! Brian Donlevy is very good as the D.A. "Nick Bianco" (Mature) must do business with in order to be free. It works!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three Reasons for Greatness: Plot, Polish, and Victor Mature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kiss of Death (1947)Three Reasons for Greatness: Plot, Polish, and Victor Mature1) Victor Mature gives a impassioned, inward-looking performance to die for. 2) The story is gripping, and reasonable, and pits the lone man trying to go right against all the forces that all of us face: the system, the bad guys, and our own mistakes. 3) The studio system is at its technical best and supports the story with polished, professional acting, camera-work, direction, and sound.In the general sense, these are actually pretty basic things that every movie might have: a lead we can identify with, a great story, and well made. Kiss of Death lacks only those rare qualities of originality in some other noir films, like we see in Sunset Boulevard or Detour, to keep it from the stratosphere. But it's better than most by far.Mature, throughout, is not portrayed as a criminal type, "One of those mugs that don't belong to human society," as Donlevy says as Assistant D.A. Bianco has good handwriting, he has composure, he loves his kids. And a great small reinforcement happens when he goes to the orphanage to see them and the nun looks at him and his two cop guards and asks, "Which one of you gentlemen is Mr. Bianco." The camera lets us pan over them and we see them as the same. And he mildly says, "That's me." Mature is really amazing in a role that could have been hammed up or stiffened up. His large, meaty presence is presented with a kind of innocence, as if he is the victim in this life process going on all around him that he has no control over. The movie asserts the truth in this at the start--he has tried to get work for a year as an ex- con, and social stigma stands in his way, leading to the jewel heist as an act of desperation. Furthermore, Mature is more principled than anyone ought to be, refusing to rat until he's been lied to by those he was protecting with silence. In a way, he gradually rises to a kind of folk hero status, in this very private, limited way, affecting only a handful of people, but doing so flawlessly.Of course, it's Richard Widmark (in his very first film) who makes Mature practically a saint by being an unrepenting psychopath. The ten seconds it takes him to grab an old woman in a wheelchair, tie her up with an electric cord, and roll her screaming down the stairs is justifiably famous. Even though you know it's coming, it's about as heartless as anything in the movies, and played with economy, not dwelling on it, just punching you in the stomach. And watch him contort and fall in the last scene where he's shot in the street. This is the kind of thing the French auteur directors drooled over.The photography is interesting for being ultimately conservative and superb at the same time. The camera is almost always level, framed with geometric precision, using light to create depth and complexity, sometimes shooting through windows or screens to add to the visual complexity, but rarely or never using strong angles off of vertical, or zeroing in on a face or hand so closely it fills the screen. These are all carefully executed shots, and scenes, and it is editing with equal precision. In all, the movie is a model not of daring and pizazz, but of adhering to the rules so perceptively, it sparkles. It's possible this was partly done to heighten its documentary realism, but Norbert Brodine is a conservative shooter at heart, so between him and Hathaway's workingman's approach, we would expect what we see here.The movie is not a great social commentary despite the suggestion at the beginning that it might explore the causes of crime, and despite its use of actual New York State locations for all the shooting. But it doesn't want to be. It leverages well worn clichés because that's the quickest way to get us to relate to the man trying to get his life straight. That's all its about, really. Even in the voice-over by his eventual new wife, heard at the beginning and end, we hear a tale about one man only.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Film-Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the New York Christmas, the family man Nick Bianco (Victor Mature) has bad luck and criminal record, and can not find a honest job. He is caught in a jewelry heist, but he does not accept the proposal of the Assistant District Attorney Louis D'Angelo (Brian Donlevy) to be a squealer and denounce his accomplices and he goes to prison. Three years later, his depressed woman commits suicide and his two daughters are sent to an orphanage. Nick makes a deal with Mr. D'Ángelo and rats his former partners; then he marries Nettie (Collen Gray), moves to another to town with a new identity, where he finds a honest job. However, when the psychopathic killer Tommy Udo (Richard Widmark) is sentenced not-guilty in a trial where Nick was forced to testimony against the criminal, the desperate Nick uses one last attempt to save his family from the psychotic killer."Kiss of Death" is a powerful film-noir, with an engaging and credible plot, fantastic direction of Henry Hathaway and great performances of Victor Mature and Richard Widmark. Among the movies that I have watched of the great actor Richard Widmark, this is his best performance and he really deserved his nomination to the Oscar. His sadistic character is really a scary cold-blood killer. The black and white cinematography is amazing, with great use of shadows valorized by the image of the DVD. Karl Malden in the beginning of his successful career has a minor participation. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Beijo da Morte" ("Kiss of the Death")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another strong Mature (Victor that is) film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The bulk of Kiss of Death is a modest, based-on-a-true-story tale of crime and woe. There's nothing spectacular about Nick or his circumstances, and nothing particularly compelling about his turn as a stool pigeon. Kiss of Death is almost romantic-comedy-like in its execution: Man meets crime, man leaves crime, man hooks up with crime again. Crisis, resolution. Yet out of the nondescript foundation emerge a few noteworthy aspects.The first and most noticeable is the realistic look of the film. Director Henry Hathaway goes straight to the source, shooting scenes on their actual locations. This is noticeable because the opening credits tell you so; how quaint to throw a little self-promotion right there in the intro! Fortunately, this hokiness doesn't detract from some truly beautiful camera-work achieved by cinematographer Norbert Brodine. New York has a distinct look, and Brodine makes the most of it. Establishing shots of lights and skyscrapers in silhouette lead into a New York in full seasonal glory, with Christmas shoppers amok in the streets. From posh nightclubs to gritty prisons, Hathaway and Brodine milk as much texture from the locations as possible.The self-promotional focus on cinematography quietly gives way to Victor Mature's personable portrayal of Nick. Though he worked through six decades, Mature was never a big name or recognized star. Indeed, his relative lack of star quality allows him to succeed in this modest, intimate tale culled from the real life of a small time hood. Mature doesn't steal the show by any means, but he capably anchors it and gives Nick some plausibility and a sympathetic quality. When Coleen Gray arrives on the scene as Nick's former nanny, we can somehow buy their slapdash romantic entanglement. Gray is also capable in her role, sweet but not saccharine, petite but with a hint of spark. Her perkiness doesn't grate, and there seems to be more to her than just a pretty face and her status as Nick's love interest. She has the intriguing "I want to know more about this woman" vibe that characterized Judy Garland's stardom, though Gray would never reach those levels of fame.Mature may not steal the show, but Richard Widmark does. Like Coleen Gray, Widmark made his debut in Kiss of Death. Unlike Gray's, his performance left an indelible mark on cinema and made Widmark a household name overnight. Tommy Udo is such a ruthless, depraved character, and his manner crawls under your skin so thoroughly, that Widmark is impossible to ignore. His characterization could so easily have spasmed across the line into caricature, or become smarmy or irritating. But Udo's manic, staccato laugh just skirts that edge, and his bitterly cold eyes and palpable menace invigorate later scenes. The unnecessary murder he commits on screen is shocking; it isn't hard to see why Joe Pesci would evoke shades of Tommy Udo in Goodfellas. In fact, Widmark's Oscar-nominated turn as Udo would inspire countless nods from subsequent maniacal mobsters.These characters spice up an otherwise small, vague tale. Kiss of Death morphs though a series of focus shifts. It seems like a hardboiled crime saga at times, a political game at others, even a tale of family values and romance. It ends up in a dramatic knot of danger and redemption. Its inability to stick with one theme gives Kiss of Death a wishy-washy, gutless quality. But touches of depth, particularly the way Eleazar Lipsky's script makes the end of the film tense and involving instead of anticlimactic, keep the otherwise straightforward story fresh.The tale is also enhanced by a couple of pure noir moments. The most obvious is Nick's nervous vigil when he knows Udo is coming for him. A car's headlights slice through the dark house and set off a game of hide-and-seek in the shadows. The pressure mounts, and you just know that someone is bound to die. I don't know how film noir can support such ludicrous amounts of shadow, but it does so to powerful effect. Noir jumps back onto the front burner when Nick takes matters into his own hands at the end of the film. A showdown with Udo over a restaurant table is fraught with peril and tension; mostly because of Widmark's scintillating menace, but partially because of the composition and the score.A superb commentary by James Ursini and Alain Silver walks us through the nuances of the film without much pause or filler. The pair has an impressive understanding of film noir, and they're able to parlay that knowledge into an engaging commentary. Though I don't fault most of their specific points, Ursini and Alain Silver hold the film in higher esteem than I do. This is good for noir fans because the commentators highlight the positives in each shot, performance, and theme.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard hitter from Hathaway, Hecht and Lederer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adapted from a story by Eleazar Lipsky, Kiss Of Death is a tough, even frightening Crime/Noir picture that has a gritty realistic feel. Helped enormously by director Henry Hathaway shooting the whole picture in New York, Kiss Of Death is also notable for being the searing debut of Richard Widmark. With no intention of soft soaping the story, the makers cunningly lure us viewers onto the seamy New York streets. Thus with the New York locations as expertly used as they are by Hathaway, Kiss Of Death attains a documentary style similar to other notable genre pictures like Call Northside 777 (also Hathaway).Narrating the picture is Nettie (Coleen Gray in her first credited role), the second wife of Nick Bianco (Victor Mature). Telling of his rough and troubled life, we learn that Bianco was part of a gang who was caught during a jewelry robbery over the Christmas holiday. Lied to by his lawyer, Bianco learns during his prison term that his first wife has killed herself and that his darling two girls have been packed off to an orphanage. Fretting and desperate to see his girls, Bianco makes a deal with Assistant District Attorney Louis D'Angelo (Brian Donlevy), where in exchange for is parole, he will rat out his old gang buddies. D'Angelo is mostly concerned with one man tho, sadistic murderer and boss, Tommy Udo (Widmark). Bianco must pal up to Udo and hope that he doesn't get found out, for if he does, Udo is sure to enact psychotic retribution on Nick and all those close to him.Mature gives one of his finest shows as the pained Bianco forced to squeal, Gray as his second wife is sedate and effective and Donlevy as the crusading Assistant D.A. with a heart is as reliable as he always is. But all are playing second fiddle to Widmark, ferocious stare, dirty laugh and an unnerving falsetto voice, it announced Widmark to the cinematic world, garnered him a contract with Twentieth Century Fox and he never looked back afterwards. Some of his scenes are just mesmerising, including one that is as shocking as it is a lesson in villainy. Taut and tight scripting from the Hecht/Lederer partnership, with rounded characters and a sensible plot, Kiss Of Death is not to be missed by the Crime/Noir genre/style fan. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nick Bianco is a smalltime robber who finds himself facing a long prison sentence. He is offered a deal which presents him with a tough dilemma. Can he reform? Does he have it in him to turn his back on his criminal pals? Is he capable of leading a useful life? Manhattan is itself the very essence of film noir. What Lorca called "the extrahuman architecture and furious rhythm" of The City, this totally manmade environment, is both impressive and somehow sinister. Borrowing from German Expressionism, the makers of noir saw the Metropolis as a twentieth-century emanation of the Frankenstein theme - that by industrialising, we have created our own worst nightmare. In "Kiss Of Death" we get the obligatory Manhattan skyline, but more significantly Bianco's new home, outside which his little girls roller-skate, is overshadowed by brooding spans of bridges. No matter how Bianco may love his domestic idyll, The City is in him and around him, and he cannot escape "that good old hoodlum complex". The screenplay by gifted noirists Hecht and Lederer is excellent. Complex strategy, both in Di Angelo's plans to outwit the witness-intimidators, and Nick's final showdown with the bad guy, is conveyed effortlessly to the viewer. The little touches by which Nick gains our sympathy (unfair treatment in the workplace, his good handwriting, etc.) are expertly laid. The scene in which Di Angelo gradually undermines Nick's hostility is a particularly fine piece of writing. Though a major criminal trial forms a plot pivot, the writers resist the temptation to wallow in courtroom drama. We see nothing of the trial, and the movie is slicker and tauter for it. In a similar vein, mobster Pete Rizzo is important to the story, but never actually appears onscreen. His presence would only slacken the narrative rhythm. The fact od Nettie's marriage is communicated to the viewer with elegant concision, and her happy home life is shown symbolically, without being dwelt upon. Richard Widmark is simply marvellous as Tommy Udo, the creepy psycho. His oscillation between manic levity and unhinged viciousness is fascinating to watch. The scene where Udo humiliates his "moll" Buster is a masterpiece of cruelty which tells us a great deal about both characters. As the intelligent bulwark of right-thinking society, Brian Donlevy gives a memorable performance in the role of Assistant District Attorney Louie Di Angelo. Coleen Gray is ideal in the part of Nettie, the thoroughly nice girl who falls for Nick. She even takes over the movie's narration, making an interesting shift in tone from terse, authoritative male voice to the softer 'social conscience' theme of which her character is the embodiment. And the film is not afraid to espouse the liberal cause. Nick loves his children, and a heartless, uncaring society won't give him a job. He is wrong to stage the hold-up to get money for Christmas presents, but what choice have we hypocrites left him? "Nobody's cried over me for a long time," says Nick. We believe him. Henry Hathaway brings quiet assurance to the directing. The suspense is developed masterfully in two key places, neither sequence relying on dialogue at all for its emotional power. The first is the interminable elevator ride at the start of the film, and the second is Nick's long vigil near the end, as he waits alone for his nemesis to arrive. Earl Howser is played by Taylor Holmes in a superb depiction of a crooked attorney, the glad-handing, glib-tongued "eminent shyster with connections". In the second conference at Osning, the unctuous Howser says "Sit down, son, sit down," then casts a wily look at Nick which reveals his reptilian cunning. Hathaway and his Director of Photography, Norbert Brodine, have come up with one of the best, and best-looking, of all films-noirs. The unrelenting geometry of the wall bricks in the cell area, and the daunting shadow of the bars, represent symbolically the way in which an unyielding society has caged Nick Bianco and closed down his options. Osning's rigid architecture, shot in exaggerated perspective, is the emblem of society's inflexibility. Shadows of prison bars slant across characters' faces. We are all enclosed and limited by the industrial monster which we have created. The prisoners carry out meaningless work in the machine shop, the crazily spinning bobbins standing for the barren bustle of modern life, and the ubiquitous twine the web of capitalism in which we unfortunates are ensnared. The clang and rumble of el-trains invades living-rooms, the heartbeat of the evil giant entering every facet of our lives. "Kiss Of Death" was shot in genuine locations rather than on studio sets, and the use of real buildings gives it an interesting look. Doorways are used throughout the film for clever dramatic effects. Nick's first kiss with Nettie is shot through a doorway, suggesting furtiveness, putting the viewer in the position of a disapproving janitor. The doorway of the bordello opens to Udo, but is slammed in Nick's face. He does not belong here. A moment of sincere mutual affection between Di Angelo and Nick - the only one in the film - happens in a doorway, as if these two men from different worlds can only ever coincide in this transitory way. At the orphanage, a doorway allows us to glimpse a stained-glass crucifix just as Nick is about to embrace his daughters - and redemption. The reunion with Conchita and Rosaria is very moving, and beautifully acted by Mature. Verdict - A Superior Noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Criminal Principles &amp; Family Values</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Kiss Of Death" is a tense crime drama which tells the story of a criminal whose main preoccupations and motivations centre on his family. The plot is unveiled in a style which utilises both neo-realist and expressionist elements and the many scenes filmed on location in the actual places referred to in the story are very effective and contribute strongly to the authenticity of the events depicted. The original story was based on actual events and was written by Eleazar Lipsky who himself had previously been a New York Assistant District Attorney. The use of a documentary style to deliver a very human story could've been regarded as incongruous but this potential problem was avoided by using a sympathetic narration by Coleen Gray."Kiss Of Death" is notable for the fact that it provided Richard Widmark with his sensational screen debut which was so successful that it almost immediately elevated him to star status and won him a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Eleazar Lipsky was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Writing, Original Story.After carrying out a jewellery robbery, Nick Bianco (Victor Mature) is caught by the police as he tries to make his getaway. Assistant DA Louis D'Angelo (Brian Donlevy) encourages him to inform on his three accomplices who had successfully escaped from the crime scene, in exchange for a reduced sentence. Nick has a wife and two daughters but being confident that they would be looked after by his lawyer and accomplices when he is in prison, refuses to co-operate.Three years later, after his wife commits suicide and his daughters are placed in an orphanage, Nick is visited by Nettie (Coleen Gray) who used to be his girls' babysitter. She tells him that his wife had been attacked by one of his gang, Pete Rizzo and this provokes him into offering the Assistant DA all the information he had previously withheld. Due to the passage of time since the crime, the offer of a reduced sentence is no longer available but Nick does get to visit his girls if he agrees to provide some useful details about another unsolved case. Nick obliges by telling D'Angelo about an earlier robbery he carried out with Rizzo and then goes on to tell his lawyer that Rizzo had been the police's informer.Nick's lawyer, Earl Howser (Taylor Holmes) then contacts hit man Tommy Udo (Richard Widmark) who goes to Rizzo's home and gets angry when he's told by Rizzo's crippled mother that her son isn't in. In his fury, he binds Ma Rizzo up with some cable and despatches her, in her wheelchair, down a flight of stairs, killing her in the process. Nick had known Udo in prison and after meeting him again, gains enough information from him about the murder he'd carried out for D'Angelo to take the case to court. Nick, who by this time is married to Nettie and is settled in a regular job, bravely testifies but the work of a clever mob attorney ensures that Udo is acquitted. This puts Nick in mortal danger and sets the story up for its powerful finale.In the introduction to the movie, it's explained that as an ex-con, Nick had found it impossible to get a job and with Christmas approaching and no money for presents for his wife and children, he took part in the jewellery store robbery. This predicament is something with which most people can immediately empathise and as such provides a compelling start to this fine movie. Equally riveting, are the brilliantly tense sequences, particularly those seen when the gang are making their escape from the crime scene, when Nick waits nervously for Udo to come and hunt him down and also in the run up to the scene in which Nick and Udo have their final confrontation. The murder of Rizzo's mother is incredibly shocking and Udo's insane giggling is chilling.All the acclaim Richard Widmark received for his portrayal of Udo was thoroughly justified and his depiction of this psychopathic, drug fuelled maniac with his trademark giggle and crazy eyes is exceptional. Victor Mature's performance is perfectly understated as it conveys Nick's basic decency and stoicism without ever becoming maudlin or self-pitying. He was a man whose principles as a criminal prevented him from co-operating with the police, however, when a conflict arose between these principles and his family values, the latter took precedence. Coleen Gray is also faultless as the bubbly, good natured Nettie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Kiss of Death" is a fairly standard noir drama made memorable by the presence of Richard Widmark as the maniacal gangster Tommy Udo. All the time while watching him though, I kept thinking of Frank Gorshin as The Riddler in the campy 'Batman' TV show of the mid-Sixties. Probably because I was a teenager when 'Batman' came out, and I had already seen Gorshin doing his impression bits on variety shows of the era. It would be interesting to surmise that Gorshin based his Riddler on Widmark's Tommy Udo, but his own explanation removes that possibility.Without Widmark, this story would probably be relegated to 'just another crime drama' status, even though a good performance is turned in by it's principal, Victor Mature, as a criminal attempting to go straight via the 'stoolie' route. His character, Nick Bianco, is portrayed as a caring family man who becomes even more conflicted after his wife commits suicide while he's in the can. That's where he and Tommy first hook up, with their entanglement proceeding on the outside when both are paroled.What makes the picture particularly interesting for me were all the great location street scenes that give the picture it's New York City flavor. Did you ever see such brand spanking new looking taxi cabs as those shown here, courtesy of Yellow Cab and Sky View? Try finding one as classy today and you'll be looking a long time.What you don't want to do while watching is put this film under the microscope for some of the credibility defying moments that creep into the story. There's that tense shadowy scene when Nick Bianco waits for Tommy Udo and his goons to show up at his house, and it turns out to be Assistant D.A. D'Angelo (Brian Donlevy). Then when Nick confronts Tommy at the restaurant, you have to wonder why he made it past the front door. But the question that really nagged me throughout the story was this - why did every hood in the big house always wear a suit and tie?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Small-time hood Nick Bianco (Victor Mature) is sent up the river for a jewel heist. He refuses to cooperate with the D.A. and will not turn stool-pigeon on his pals. But after he learns of his wife's suicide, he changes his tune. He's got to get out of jail to take care of his two little girls. The D.A. agrees to help Bianco if, in return, Bianco will help the D.A. Bianco fingers Tommy Udo (Richard Widmark) for a murder and even agrees to testify at the trial. But, when Udo is acquitted, Bianco knows he's a marked man ? as are his new wife and his young daughters.Kiss of Death is a solid entry in the crime/noir cycle of the 40s. The movie looks good, has some great acting, an intelligent plot, characters you can care about, and enough twists to make it all very interesting. But instead of writing at length about the acting or technical aspects of the film or plot twists or anything else, I'll limit this to a few comments on Richard Widmark. If you look over Widmark's filmography, you'll notice that Kiss of Death was his very first film. Now I haven't seen everything Widmark made, but based on what I have seen, his portrayal of Tommy Udo has to be the performance of a career. He's brilliant as Udo. You can see the evil in his eyes. He's the kind of guy who would just as soon put a bullet in you as look at you. And that maniacal laugh ? it's nothing short of chilling. This is not meant to be hyperbole when I say that he's the quintessential 40s hood played to perfection. I've seen a lot of noirs in recent weeks and I don't think I've seen a performance or character that I've enjoyed more than Widmark's Tommy Udo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Henry Hathaway directed this revenge story that stars Victor Mature as Nick Bianco, a small-time crook sent to prison after a jewel heist who refuses to inform on his gang, because of his wife. After learning his wife committed suicide, and knowing he was double-crossed, Nick does cooperate with the D.A.(played by Brian Donlevy) and gets paroled. He then remarries, to a woman named Nettie(played by Coleen Gray) and gets a job. Things are fine, until one of the old gang he informed on named Tommy Udo(played by Richard Widmark in his film debut) comes calling, hell-bent on revenge... Unremarkable story on the whole, except for one thing: Widmark's unforgettable performance as ruthless and giggling killer Tommy Udo, one of cinema's most memorable villains, with that iconic scene of his pushing the poor wheelchair-bound woman down the stairs while he laughs maniacally being most memorable. He steals the film, and his performance was Oscar-worthy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond The Film Noir Came .... A Moment Of Retribution And Silence!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I highly recommend this classic film noir story of a thief, Nick Bianco (Victor Mature) that is faced with the tough decision to turn "stool pigeon" and "rat out" a maniacal killer, Tommy Udo (Richard Widmark). Nick is a "two-time loser" and the only way he will ever get to see his orphaned kids is by "playing ball" with the cops (Brian Donlevy and Karl Malden). This film is magnificently directed by Henry Hathaway who directed such great films as True Grit, How The West Was Won, Rawhide, 13 Rue Madeleine, etc. I once read that Victor Mature was a close friend of Henry Hathaway, and that he was well aware of Hathaway's temper and reputation of mistreating actors on the set during the filming of his pictures. Consequently, Mature warned Hathaway going into the film that he "wouldn't put up with any temper tantrums or abuse during the filming". Hathaway complied in order to get Mature to agree to do the film. Richard Widmark remarked in an interview that "Kiss of Death" was his first film, and that contributed to that wonderful maniacal laugh he gave in many of the films most memorable scenes. The nervous laugh probably was also due to Hathaway's heavy handed direction. In any event, Hathaway threw a temper tantrum during the shooting that caused Mature to walk off the set and sit in a limousine for an hour or so until one of Hathaway's aides begged him to return. Mature's returned to the set on condition that Hathaway behave himself i.e. no more temper tantrums. Later during the filming when Hathaway once again started to go off into another outburst ... Mature politely raised his finger and said "Not even pantomime!". This is one of Victor Mature's best films...and newcomer Richard Widmark steals the show. Widmark was a very underrated actor and deserved a supporting actor Oscar for his performance!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though he saw his gangster father cut down by police bullets, you have to wonder how a kind hearted, sympathetic character as Nick Bianco, well played by Victor Mature, settled down to a life of crime.In addition, was there anything going on with Nick and the babysitter while Nick's wife was living? They sure teamed up quickly and Nick remarried very fast after his wife's suicide.Despite these possible flaws, we have an engrossing film dealing with a gangster must face when he starts squealing on fellow mob members.Of course, Richard Widmark steals the movie with his performance of the insane hooligan with that memorable laugh, eerie smile and depraved indifference to human life. Throwing a wheel-chair bound Mildred Dunnock down the stairs was most shocking. It would take a performance such as the one given by Edmund Gwenn in the family tradition film, "Miracle on 34th St." to defeat Widmark. Ironically, Widmark was never Oscar nominated again.</fullReview>

It's pretty effective and sure, there wasn't anything else like it on film in '47, no sir.What about the rest of this? Well--others have pointed out-the romance happens rather suddenly, I thought Widmark played a little too much by the rules towards the end-why didn't one of his goons just off him in the restaurant-?? and sure, they tacked on the wife's suicide rather conveniently-but, for the most part, this does work.Look for Karl Malden in a smallish early role. I also enjoy watching Brian Donlevy, he usually played sgt majors and the like, here you can see why.

		<fullReview>Victor Mature plays a hood who's picked up in an attempted jewelry heist and decides to play ball with the police by becoming an informant. Richard Widmark, in a famous performance as a giggling psychopath, is one of the crooks Mature rats out, and it's up to him to figure out how to get Widmark out of the picture before he comes after his wife and kids.Director Henry Hathaway gives this no-nonsense docu-crime-thriller a gritty and authentic look (a title card at the opening claims that the film was shot entirely on actual locations) and uses virtually no musical score to complement the action. I thought the pacing was a bit sluggish at times, but Widmark alone makes the film worth watching, and overall it's a great addition to the hard-boiled films that were so prevalent in the years immediately following World War II.Brian Donlevy has a supporting role as a district attorney, and if you blink you may miss a young Karl Malden as a detective.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kiss of Death marks Widmark's Oscar-nominated debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since this movie was made while there was still a Production Code, that is before the movie ratings system of 1968, Kiss of Death may strike some modern-day viewers as dull except for the famous scene of Richard Widmark's Tommy Udo pushing Mildred Dunnock's crippled woman down a flight of stairs, a sequence I first saw as a clip in Sean Penn's 1984 Bad Boys. From a script by Ben Hecht and Charles Lederer with direction by Henry Hathaway, this movie takes its time with the story of Nick Bianco (Victor Mature), a career criminal who can't get a break going legit so he robs a jewelry store during the Christmas season and gets caught. It's in jail that he meets Udo who he befriends. Initially refusing to play "stool pigeon", he changes his mind after a tragedy involving his wife. That's all I'll tell you except I'll also mention good support from Coleen Gray as the narrator and Mature's second wife and, especially, Brian Donlevy as the attorney who tries to protect Nick. Because sequences involving the first wife were not allowed under the Code, like I said, it might make for dull viewing but when some of it gets mentioned later one can almost put two and two together and make for some compelling visuals for the thinking mind to ponder. It's the performances of Mature and Widmark and the various point-of-view shots and shadowy lighting that makes this one of the more compelling film noir's of the late '40s. So for all of the above, I highly recommend this movie. P.S. Look for a young Karl Malden.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Richard Widmark asks where's that squealin' son of yours.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes you have to reflect a bit on the world of the film. Most of the time you just know and the encounter is all brute force.This is a solid crime drama, one of the most bleak (forget the wistful ending, you just know it was meddled with for the Code). A straight- up crook has to turn stoolie to be re-united with his two daughters, in doing so gets a new family, a new lease of life, but the plot backfires late in the night and a psychotic mobster will be looking for him and his daughters.Richard Widmark in his screen debut is just delicious to watch, a seething mass of barely contained violence and twitching nerves. He was so good he spawned real-life imitators in the mob.But this also goes for a film noir vibe, at least by token of the period it was made. It gets shadows right and has that gritty sense of place - actual New York streets - but is a bit off on certain characteristics I deem as quite defining of a good noir.The engine per the noir model, is that our man wanted to go straight but the world refused him, refused him because he had a record, all this is narrated to us on the way to a job that goes wrong, and he had a record it is mused because of a certain childhood scene with his no-good father. So the tracks were already laid-out for him long ago and he's merely being pushed along by learned instinct - you may note this as fate.Ideally in a film noir, dark impulse - usually personified in the femme fatale - is so overwhelming, so clouds perception, that reality itself begins to feel like it's being rewritten into a kind of nightmare. Incidental to this are the dreamlike perturbations in the world of the film, the frequently-met trope of a story being invented, a fiction in place of the real thing, and the illusion of fate, all of them key noir elements.The woman here is pure as the driven snow, perhaps this small detail exemplifies all the difference. The impulse is to do the right thing, our man serving justice.But we still have the solid crime drama and two memorable performers in the leads.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>two words: Tommy Udo!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Victor Mature had no illusions about his acting; when he was rejected for membership to a golf club because he was an actor, he said, "I'm no actor, and I've got 65 movies to prove it." However unpretentious he was, when he was cast in the right role, he came off well, as he does here in the noir "Kiss of Death." Mature plays Nick Bianco, a con who becomes a stool pigeon for the D.A. (Brian Donlevy) so that he can get a parole and retrieve his kids from an orphanage. He marries a friend of his late wife's (Coleen Gray) and uses another name so that his kids won't be tainted by his old criminal life. It all goes well until he has to testify in court against Tommy Udo. Then his life and that of his family are in grave danger."Kiss of Death" is notable for being the auspicious debut of Richard Widmark, and few actors have had such a powerful introduction to an audience. As the sadistic Tommy Udo, Widmark's raw laugh and smirk are chill-inducing. His famous scene - maybe the most famous scene of his career, as well as being a famous scene, period - occurs when he throws an old woman in her wheelchair down a flight of stairs. And laughs. A fantastic performance.The beautiful Coleen Gray plays Nettie, Nick's wife. Despite her looks and good acting, Gray never achieved big stardom, though she had some excellent roles. I wonder if she just wouldn't play ball with Zanuck. Now 89, she is an attractive woman who continues to make public appearances, usually at screenings of the film "Nightmare Alley." Here she's perfect as a loving, worried woman. She also narrates.Mature gives a solid performance as Nick -- he was really in his métier here and in films like "I Wake Up Screaming," though he graduated (or was demoted) to beefcake roles in period pictures later on. He had the physique but he wasn't a great actor and somehow, it was more apparent in those movies.I feel very privileged to have met and spoken with Coleen Gray and to have heard the remarkable Richard Widmark speak in person, so I have an affection for this film. Even if I didn't, it's still good and well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Widmark Makes His Mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No need to recap the plot. At first I thought those lovey-dovey scenes with Mature and Gray were just Hollywood working in a woman's angle in a man's picture. But, no, they're necessary for building the tension, so thick by movie's end, you can cut it with the proverbial knife. After all, what could be sweeter than the two little daughters and Gray, on one hand, and the pathologically sadistic Widmark, on the other. As a result, we understand why Mature risks life and limb to get the madman before he gets the little family.Also, the tension really works because we know Widmark's nutcase would slice-and-dice Santa, given half a chance. Just the thought of pain sends him into maniacally drooling giggles. Watch his girlfriend freeze up in fear when he even hints at anger. His world is divided into two, either Big Men or Squirts, and we know what happens to the latter. In fact, Udo's one of the most memorable of all Hollywood psychos and a really shuddery movie debut for otherwise nice guy, Widmark.It's also a good tight screenplay from Hecht-Lederer, the scenes building effectively on one another and the location filming. Note also, how they manage to sneak in the brief bordello ("perfume") scene at a time when such was taboo. Mature too, is surprisingly effective as the reformed crook, his scenes with the little girls conveying genuine emotion. And was there ever a slipperier mob lawyer than the great Taylor Holmes, one of those unsung personalities who always added color to whatever they were in. I guess my only gripe is the ending. Okay, I'll give the screenplay the implausible trap that Nick sets since it's so nerve-wracking. But five shots into Nick at point blank range, only to be hauled away to recovery. Come on! Five is just too many to survive. My guess is the reassuring voice-over from wife Nettie (Gray) was at the insistence of the censors. Nonetheless, the movie furnishes one of the best crime dramas of the decade and grist for a thousand celebrity impersonations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Widmark lifts it above the ordinary...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There can't have been many more explosive debuts than that made by Richard Widmark as Tommy Udo, the giggling psychopathic gangster, and his is a performance that still stands up well today. He ? together with some top-drawer cinematography - certainly lifts this classic noir out of the ordinary. Take Widmark out of the picture, though, and the implausibility of the plot ? and Nick Bianco's character arc ? are left too exposed to pass more than cursory inspection.Victor Mature is overshadowed by Widmark despite giving one of the better performances of his career. He plays Bianco, a career criminal who must have the world's most demanding offspring because, according to the narration from the woman who becomes his wife (Coleen Gray), he only robs a jewellery store to pay for his kiddies Christmas presents. The heist goes wrong and Bianco takes the rap for his accomplices. While in prison nobody thinks to tell him that his first wife has stuck her head in a gas oven leaving their children effectively orphaned. Typical 40s plot developments mean the ex-con on parole gets his kids back with no questions asked about whether he is a suitable role model. Quickly wedding the willing Coleen, Bianco finds himself with a family to protect when the case against Widmark's Tommy Udo in which Bianco is a key witness, collapses.At this point the film cranks up the tension and gives us a tense and gripping depiction of Bianco's increasing fear as he bundles his family off to the country and apprehensively awaits a visit from the vengeful Udo. The restaurant confrontation between them crackles with tension, and it's just a shame that the final act is so contrived and unbelievable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fabulously dark and brooding noir!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film noir is one of my favourite types of cinema, and Kiss of Death is easily one of the best that I've seen. The film benefits from all the familiar noir elements; such as a dark and brooding atmosphere, a conflicted lead character and a very dastardly villain. The plot is the film's key element, as it manages to thrill, enthral and make its audience think at the same time. The film takes in common noir elements such as jail time, revenge and doing what you have to do and winds it tightly around the story of one man. Nick Bianco is still suffering from the jail time he did as a youngster and can't get himself a job. So, robbing a jewellery store seems to be the answer; only that plan turns awry when Nick is caught and thrown in jail. He's given the chance to rat out his associates in return for a relaxed sentence, but Nick refuses. Soon after, however, Nick learns that his wife has committed suicide, leaving his two daughters to live in an orphanage. He soon decides to take the offer of ratting on his friends in order to get himself out, and it's not long before Nick finds himself falling foul of psychotic gangster Tommy Udo...Richard Widmark would, of course, go on to feature in many great noir films; and it's not hard to see why after his debut performance here. Despite not having a lot of screen time, Widmark dominates the film as Tommy Udo and takes a lot of thunder away from the star of the show, Victor Mature. That's not to say that Mature doesn't put in a decent (if a little flat) performance as the unfortunate lead, but he's easy to ignore every time Widmark shares the screen with him. The scene that Kiss of Death is most notorious for sees Widmark pushing a wheelchair-bound woman down the stairs. Said scene is the standout of the movie, and really gives the film reason to remember it for. Henry Hathaway takes the director's chair and does an excellent job with it. Kiss of Death isn't Hathaway's first noir and it seems he has learned from previous films as he instils this one with a fascinating gloomy atmosphere and ensures that the film delivers the thrills in all the right places. On the whole, Kiss of Death is a genre film that definitely deserves the accolade 'must see', and I wouldn't hesitate to list this among more esteemed classics. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I taped this off UK C4 on 7th Feb 1987 and by now have probably seen it nearly 10 times. I've always meant to but always forgot to count the number of times someone says "kids" in it - it makes me wince after half a dozen utterances. I don't really know why it grates so much with me, I know it's a necessary part of the story, but I think it's maybe the only fault in a near perfect picture.Hoodlum Mature turns squealer against psycho gangster Widmark after his shyster lawyer broke his promise to take care of his wife and ... kids while he was in prison. After 3 years in stir his wife gasses herself to death and the ... kids are being brought up in a Catholic orphanage. Playing ball with the law, they deflect exposure by fingering another hoodlum Pete Rizzo whose disabled mother is callously murdered by a giggling Widmark as a warning. A memorable scene indeed! From all accounts it could have been much worse with a rape and the suicide to depict - thank you Mr. Censor for not spoiling an already excellent film with more violence. Nowadays of course there are no holds barred - they make sure to rub your nose hard and continuously into all kinds of filth and violence while watching films.Widmark's first perv-ormance as manic man's man Tommy Udo was unforgettable, solid and believable Mature had learnt to control his beetling eyebrows by this one, and Brian Donlevy played such a nice Asst. D.A. made me wish he'd played a few more good guys in his career. Tremendous stuff.</fullReview>

He refuses to squeal on his cohorts, believing that they'll take care of his wife and daughters when he does his time. No dice. His wife ends up killing herself due to her abject poverty and, to save his daughters from the orphanage, Mature decides to go full-on piggy and squeal his guts out. One of his targets is former cellmate Richard Widmark. Unfortunately he's a total maniac and, when the case doesn't stick, Widmark targets Mature and his family. Widmark is the reason to watch it. He's delightfully psychotic. He received a deserved Oscar nomination for the film. I think my main problem was with Mature, who's kind of boring. I regret the fact that Widmark is only in the film for like 12 minutes. Brian Donlevy and Coleen Gray co-star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average noir elevated to classic status by R.Widmark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Spoilers** The person who compared his role to Joe Pesci in Goodfellas makes a good comparison. They create mean psychos we love to watch on the screen and of course would never want to run into in real life. His characters little speech about squealers, his laugh and helping the handicapped down the stairs is what most people will best remember from this film.Subtract Richard Widmarks work here and you are left with what is a dull and routine film to sit through.Many classic noirs have dated elements of their time but there is enough there to make up for it - great dialogue, memorable leading ladies like Rita Hayworth. Here the woman is dull and one-note; Nick Biancos kids make your teeth clench and make you wish Tommy Udo would actually get to have some "fun" with them like he so kindly offers his pal.Victure Mature looks much older than 29 (the age mentioned for his character) but the main problem is he never seems menacing or acts much like a crook (somebody like Sterling Hayden or Richard Conte would have been better). He is far better as a copper like in 'Cry of the City'.Overall though it's better than the 1995 remake where beefed-up Nicholas Cage like Widmark gets to steal the show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>throw momma down the stairs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's Christmas Eve. Ex-con Nick Bianco (Victor Mature) has been unable to find work for a year. He robs a jewelry store with his cohorts. He is shot by the police while escaping. He refuses to cooperate with the ADA and sentenced to hard times. His wife kills herself and their two daughters end up in an orphanage. The girls' babysitter Nettie Cavallo tells him that his wife had an affair with his accomplice Pete Rizzo. The ADA won't reduce his sentence after 3 years in prison but Nick squeals on his accomplices anyways. They imply that Rizzo is the squealer. Killer Tommy Udo (Richard Widmark) comes looking for Rizzo and pushes his paralyzed mother down the stairs. For helping to locate evidence and providing testimony against Udo, Bianco gets early parole and reunites with his kids. Nettie is his new wife. Everything is great until Udo gets acquitted in his trial.Victor Mature is rather dull and stiff. I think he holds back the movie. On the other hand, Richard Widmark is having lots of fun with his crazy laugh. He actually pushes an old lady in a wheelchair down the stairs. That's a true gangster move. This is mostly a functional crime drama and an amazing villain turned in by Widmark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unable to find a job in New York City due to an extensive criminal past, Victor Mature (as Nick Bianco) goes Christmas Eve shopping for a fortune in jewels. He is caught and convicted. An understanding assistant district attorney, Brian Donlevy (as Louie D'Angelo), offers Mr. Mature a deal - if he squeals on escaped pals, Mature can get out of jail and be a father for his two preteen daughters. He repeatedly refuses, but problems with his children force Mature to reconsider. When his wife Maria sticks her head in the oven, Mature is ready to "play ball." But he must also deal with the underworld reaction...With his wickedly snickering overbite, Richard Widmark (as Thomas "Tommy" Udo) makes an impressive film debut. He received much-deserved nominations as "Best Supporting Actor" of the year from the "Film Daily" and "Academy Awards" groups, and he won the "Golden Globes" newcomer award. Don't miss what Mr. Widmark does to wheelchair-bound Mildred Dunnock. Also enjoyable is overshadowed sleazy lawyer Taylor Holmes (as Earl Howser)...Mature scores as a noble man who loves his children. Many criminals would give up the goods to spend time on the outside with pretty young babysitter Coleen Gray (as Nettie); apparently, the police did not know about this affair. The script, by Ben Hecht and Charles Lederer, is nicely peppered with realism. Cinematographer Norbert Brodine and director Henry Hathaway make excellent use of the locations. Yet, there is too subjective an objectivity, with a feeling details are missing. Some of this absence has been addressed in re-makes, but the efforts failed to capture all that makes this "Kiss of Death" engaging.******** Kiss of Death (8/13/47) Henry Hathaway ~ Victor Mature, Richard Widmark, Brian Donlevy, Coleen Gray</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On location</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1947 Twentieth Century Fox film made under the supervision of Daryl Zanuck was shot two years after the end of World War II. Most of the interior dialogue scenes and city street scenes were shot on sound stages and the back-lot at the Fox Studios in Los Angeles and New York City as was the convention then, but KISS OF DEATH is certainly one of the first big Hollywood films to actually have gone on location for a good number of scenes actually shot on the streets and in the houses of New York City. (It would be many years before American directors would have the freedom to avoid studio sets all together.) Perhaps influenced by the work of the Italian neo-realist directors who films were just being shown in America during those years, director Henry Hathaway and cinematographer Norbert Brodine take great advantage of these locations to give the film a semi-documentary feeling at times. Widmark in his first role is justly remembered for his startling role as the sadistic killer who pushed the old lady down the stairs. The old lady is Mildred Dunnock who two years later would play the attention-paying wife of Willy Loman in the first Broadway production of Arthur Miller's DEATH OF A SALESMAN. Karl Malden, who is briefly seen in the film as a detective, was playing Mitch that year on Broadway in Kazan's production of STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, the show that made Marlon Brando famous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grim and Realistic Crime Thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best of the post-war noirs. There's no treacherous femme fatale and no Robert Mitchum in a trench coat but it's got just about everything else -- a hold up, a shooting, a worried Victor Mature, prison scenes, a soupcon of happiness, big menacing black sedans, snub-nosed revolvers, monstrous .45s, a lunatic villain, a bloodless but horrifying murder, unreliable cops, and location shooting in New York City by director Henry Hathaway.Mature is Nick Bianco ("white" in Italian) who is caught during a hold up while trying to get some money for his kids' Christmas presents. Just an ordinary guy like you and me except that he holds up jewelry stores. Brian Donlevy is the District Attorney, Louis D'Angelo ("of the angels") who manipulates him into squealing on a couple of fellow heist artists and other assorted miscreants.In return for his testimony in open court against Richard Widmark's Tommy Udo (whose name means nothing to me in any language but sounds great, in some subliminally ominous way suggestive of a really bad nonsense syllable), Donlevy secures Mature's release from prison. Mature then marries the young girl he's come to love, Coleen Gray, and settles down with her and his kids in a working class suburb of New York.It doesn't last. Widmark was supposed to be put away safely in the Hotel Crowbar but is gotten off on a technicality and is now free to look up Mature and murder him, his wife, and his two children. What makes us think he's capable of such brutality? Well, for one thing, Mature is now a "squealer" and we know how Widmark handles them because he tells us. "You know what I do with squealers? I let 'em have it in the belly." For another, we've already seen what he does to a squealer's innocent, wheelchair-bound MOTHER. He ties her up in the chair and flings her down the stairs. Finally, we know he's capable of it because of Widmark's insane giggle. The performance made an icon out of Widmark. Kids at the time went around imitating his chuckle and wearing his signature dark shirt and yellow tie. It took Widmark, who was a nice guy, years to get out of that kind of role.Hats off to just about everyone involved in this production. The photography by Norbert Brodine changes subtly from documentary-style verisimilitude in the early scenes involving such locations as the visiting rooms of prisons (shot in the Tombs in New York) to minatory shadows in the last half, during which Mature must sneak around, sweating, clutching the gun in his coat pocket.The film did a splendid job of capturing that working class neighborhood in Astoria, Queens, the houses and apartment buildings appearing to slump a little, their unpretentious interiors with a little schmutz on the walls, with laborer Mature slurping water directly from one of the non-Koehler faucets at the wide, white, deep porcelain kitchen sink, and pretty, young Coleen Gray flouncing around preparing dinner, more succulent than any spaghetti and meatballs could be. Not that the picture is "ethnic" in any way. It's not "The Godfather." I didn't especially care for Donlevy's character. The script doesn't give us much reason to, although it was based on a story by a real District Attorney and presumably incorporated some of his own experiences. Just after Mature's capture, at the beginning, Donlevy calls him to his office and begins to lay a con on him, skillfully, like a guy selling Vegamatics in a TV infomercial. You have two kids, don't you, Nick? Got any pictures of them? Nice. Here's a snapshot of my kids. It's good for a man to have a family, don't you think? Feel like squealing on your partners yet? There isn't anything in the way of humor. Nobody laughs -- there's only Tommy Udo's inimitable giggle, and that's not funny. It's relentlessly grim and it ends with Mature lying on the street with four great big slugs in him. The scene plays like a death scene but there's a tag of about one minute at the very end in which Coleen Gray's narration tells us that Mature lived and that they now live happily ever after.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a student of irony I relish the fact that the outstanding stage actress Mildred Dunnock was uncredited despite being the subject of a focal scene - she is, of course, the lady in the wheelchair who Richard Widmark pushes down a flight of stairs. Actually there was quite a bit of fine acting on display here not least from leading man Victor Mature in arguably his finest performance albeit closely followed by his Doc Holliday in My Darling, Clementine. Taylor Holmes is also effective as the sleazy lawyer personified and Brian Donlevy and Colleen Gray are effective as Assistant DA and wife respectively. This makes Richard Widmark's performance all the more brilliant for eclipsing the others in what was far from a leading role. Henry Hathaway, one of the better journeyman directors of the time racks up the tension admirably and this remains highly watchable sixty years on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Victor Mature is the real star in this ace noir that made Richard Widmark's name</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick Bianco and his gang sweat through the first few minutes of this knockout noir as they pull off a jewelry heist on a high floor in a Manhattan skyscraper. The tension is superbly handled as the trio waits out a long elevator ride down, knowing that one of the tied up or unconscious jewelers could be alerting the police at any time, and the Christmas joy and cheer around them only heightens the anger and frustration that Bianco feels at having to resort to a life of crime, though we are told (by the interesting choice of a female narrator) that he's been trying to go straight. Alas, Bianco gets caught - though the rest of his gang gets away - and goes to prison, despite a sympathetic Assistant DA trying very hard to get him to save himself - and his wife and kids - by squealing.Justly famed as the film that made Richard Widmark a star, and there's no question that he steals every scene he's in, smirking and snickering with one of the creepiest laughs and most obviously crazed faces you've ever seen. But Widmark's only a supporting character, and the picture more rightly belongs to Victor Mature as the small-time lifelong con trying to go straight - and Mature delivers in probably the best performance of his career, aching with a weariness that only prison could bring to a man still in his prime, with sad eyes and regret etched into every movement in his lumbering frame. Widmark was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but IMO Mature deserved a nod in the lead category just as much; it's really hard to imagine anybody - even the biggest of noir stars like Kirk Douglas, Robert Ryan or Humphrey Bogart - doing better in the role.I won't spoil the rest of the plot - this one develops very organically and naturally for the most part, and the use of real locations in New York and the acting choices and fairly low-key music make this one of the more "real"-seeming and natural of all films noir. An utter masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Except for the stunning but a bit implausible end,"kiss of death" is close to perfect.Hathaway was anything by sentimental (except maybe in his romantic dream "Peter Ibetson" )and his "kiss of death " is a film noir extraordinaire .The story is partly told by Nattie's voice over ,a voice who tells us in the first minutes that if the hero acts as he does,he has no choice cause all his attempts at getting a job have failed.In this cruel world,Hathaway introduces quiet lovely scenes:the music lesson in the orphanage is a great moment which sharply contrasts with the rest of the movie.The cast is first rate: Mature who was certainly more intelligent than he was given credit for plays a good guy down on his luck and who tries to pick up the pieces and to enjoy a home with his daughters and his new wife;Donlevy gives a subtle performance ,and it's he who gives the kiss of death of the title;and last but not least,the absolutely outstanding Richard Widmark,who steals every scene he is in:his laugh is unforgettable,and the scene with Rizzo's disabled mother is in anyone's memory.No clichés,no femme fatale,no heroes,but a human being trying to survive in the urban jungle.The last part of the film is almost Hitchcockesque:Nick and his wife,in the night,fearing anything: a door which slams,a car in the streets ,a shadow on the wall."Wherever we were,HE would be waiting,waiting".Another great movie by Hathaway as brilliant in film noir as he was in adventure movies ("lives of a Bengal lancer")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great start for a great actor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched "Kiss of Death" about a month after the passing of the great star Richard Widmark. I think that his role in this film is one of his best and that Widmark is highly underrated.The film is about a criminal played by Victor Mature who is caught after committing a crime. He is sentenced to spend some time in jail. At first he dosen't want to snitch on his friends and is sent to jail. He reads in a newspaper while he is in jail that his wife committed suicide. Mature's character had two little girls they were sent of the an orphanage or foster-home. When he hears of this he tells the police everything they want to know and he is let out on probation. There is another snitch who has also ratted out the names of his accomplishes. His former friends find out he has ratted them out so they send out Tommy Udo played by Widmark to kill him. He gets to the informers house and finds out that he has fled the country. The informers mother is there however, and Udo decides to kill her to get revenge. She is an old sick woman in a wheel chair this does not phase Udo. He pushes her down the stairs to her death. Mature's character who was also a snitch was in danger for his former friends found out that he to had snitched on them. Through out the rest of the film Mature's character lives in fear of Udo showing up to kill him and his family. In the end Mature confronts Widmark and gets Widmark to shoot him which violates Widmarks restrictions that the law put upon him. Widmark is shot down by the police in the end and is taken to jail where he belongs. Mature's character survives and now is in no danger of being attacked by anyone again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The urge to take the Movie Camera out of the comfort of the Hollywood Studio, and out into the Real World, came into full fruition in the years immediately after the Great Conflict of WORLD WAR II. Perhaps the plentiful supply of B &amp; W film that had been exhibited during those War Years created a craving or even an expectation of more of this in all of our Theatrical experiences.Nonetheless, News Reel-Like Black &amp; White, brutally realistic Movies abounded in those years. We saw the likes of THE KILLERS (1946), BRUTE FORCE (1947), THE NAKED CITY (1948) and CALL NORTHSIDE 777 (also 1948). All of these were shot at least partially in real city scapes, with THE NAKED CITY, CALL NORTHSIDE 777 and today's reviewed film KISS OF DEATH (1947) being shot completely in real streets, real buildings, with no Studio Sound Stages employed whatsoever.KISS OF DEATH starts out with that familiar very New York melody (its name escapes me! Help,somebody, anybody!). The narrator, as we later find out is Nettie (Coleen Gray). She tells us that is Christmas and a Happy, Holy time for most. But not for the unlucky, the pitiful and pathetic hoods. We zero in on a Robbery which is in Progress, unfolding before our very eyes.Nick Biabco (Victor Mature) is one of the Stick-Up crew, but from the very beginning, we see that Nick has some other as of yet, untapped talents and abilities. He has an intelligence beyond most, but has yet to put it to good use.Well, the Christmas Eve Jewelry Store Caper goes bad and Nick is wounded by Police gun shot. He is convicted and will be shipped off to Sing-sing Prison, Ossining, N.Y. But the Assistant District Attorney Louis D'SAngelo (Brian Donlevy), sensing that Nick is just a cut or two above the typical thug, takes a special interest in him.Nick refuses to cooperate, until when in Prison he finds out that his Wife has committed suicide,leaving his two young daughters to go to a Catholic Orphanage run by Nuns. He has a change of heart, but is it too late? He is able to provide some info about one Physchotic Killer, one Tommy Udo (Richard Widmark in a watershed performance &amp; characterization). You see, the two were delivered "up the River" to the State Pen at the same time and Nick picked up some certain facts from Udo when they were together.The story involves his befriending Nettie (Colleen Gray) a friend of his now deceased wife. Who falls in love with, and he eventually marries.The story also follows Nick in his role as an informant for the D.A.'s Office and his dealing with the likes of Tommy Udo and his cohorts.This is the film that proved to be a turning point for so many of what we see as the beginning of so many film clichés. That is clichés because of the influence put on those films following. And it is considered to be Victor Mature's finest dramatic role, an assertion that would be quite hard to refute. And the sometimes under-appreciated Mr. Mature certainly proved his versatility. I mean look at the varied film types that he made. From ONE MILLION B.C.(1940), SEVEN DAYS LEAVE (1942),MY DARLING CLEMENTINE (1946), SAMSON AND DELILAH (1949) and THE ROBE/DEMETRIUS ANDC THE GLADIATORS(1953-1954), all roles are quite un-alike.This the one singular performance that put Mr. Richard Widmark's career on the Map! It will surely be the on for which he will be remembered! Just remember, though; stay away from any TOMMY NUDO NURSING HOME OR CONVELESCENT HOME! (You know why!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Noir - Mature and Widmark are Incredible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Widmark's screen debut, and a stand-out role for Victor Mature are not the only highlights of this noir crime drama. The lovely Colleen Gray heads an excellent supporting cast. The story is perfectly paced, smoothly and economically directed by the great Henry Hathaway, and beautifully filmed. All the fedoras have just the right tilt, and the shadows are cast exactly where they should be. This is classic, classy, noir.Mature plays Nick Bianco - a down-on-his luck father of two who thieves to feed his family. A slow elevator ride after a heist lands him in a lot of hot water, but he's not going to talk - even to avoid breaking his daughters' hearts. Things go even worse after he lands in jail, where he meets terrifying sociopath Tommy Udo (Widmark). Subsequent events lead to a nerve-wracking cat and mouse game between Bianco, Udo, an assistant district attorney and Bianco's lawyer.Noted for Widmark's intense performance, this film is far from a one-trick pony. It is a taught, intense noir thriller from the height of the genre. Well worth watching and highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>KISS OF DEATH easily ranks among the best film noirs of the '40s and it's widely remembered now as the first time audiences got a peek at RICHARD WIDMARK and what a fine actor he was. But it also served to remind us that when given a strong enough role, VICTOR MATURE was more than able to deliver the goods. He's excellent as Nick, the jewel thief kept back from holding decent jobs because of his prison record.When a nice D.A. (BRIAN DONLEVY) offers him a deal in exchange for squealing on some hoods, Nick finally takes the offer. The rest of the story deals with the consequences of his hard choice.Some nice supporting roles for MILDRED DUNNOCK, KARL MALDEN, COLEEN GRAY and MILLARD MITCHELL help turn this thriller, directed in taut style by Henry Hathaway, into a winner. Widmark deserved his Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actor and Mature proved that he was more than just "a hunk of man" as he was labeled in those days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The lady was most definitely not in the wheelchair, and don't need multiple !!!!!!!!!s (which everybody seems to require these days) to affirm it's true. Widmark may indeed have said that, but he was fibbing. In the first place, there was no need for anybody to be in the wheelchair. If you examine the scene frame by frame (easy to do with DVD) you can see it is empty. The scene happens so fast of course that in normal viewing, it would not have been necessary for anybody to be in the chair. You see the killer at the top, the lady with terror, and then CUT to the descending chair. Why the cut if the lady was to remain in the chair? That alone should have been tip off.Here's a trivia that may be of interest (maybe not): the very first scene of the movie, showing Times Square in New York City at Christmas, was shot not in 1947 but in 1929! How do you know this, look at the Model A Fords and and the ancient street cars. Also note what's playing at the Astor Theater(marquee plainly visible), Jeanette MacDonald and Maurice Chevalier in "The Love Parade." In the DVD commentary, which seemingly covered EVERYTHING, this apparently not noticed.</fullReview>

Also a very good performance by Victor Mature. The film has intensity and portrays very well the struggle and dilemma of a hoodlum that has to respect the code of honor among the criminals and the need of a father that knows he has to protect his little daughters that are in a orphanage. The tempo of the picture is splendid. The tension is built very well and burst into the climax when Nick Bianco make Tomy Udo lost his temper and grabs the gun himself which proves to be a fatal mistake for him and here is where, I think everybody wants Nick Bianco to survive. ( We, the spectators needed that: to go out of the movie happy, even though it shouldn't meant to be that way). The film has a couple scenes and a few lines that would be in the hall of fame of the movie pictures if would be anyone.J Robledo Peón</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Richard Widmark Is The Highlight Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that Victor Mature offered a good, if somewhat reserved, performance here as Nick Bianco, a mobster who chooses to give evidence against his fellow mobster Tommy Udo (Richard Widmark) in return for an early parole so that he can take care of his children. Although Mature is the star of the movie, I thought that Widmark really stole the show with a bang-on performance as Udo. He was exactly what I would expect that type of mobster to be. Aside from Widmark's good performance, though, I have to say that for the most part I thought this movie was essentially an average suspense flick. It picks up marks at the end for some pretty good suspense after Udo is acquitted at his trial, and Bianco becomes a target, but it also lost some points on a couple of counts. First, the relationship between Bianco and Nettie (Coleen Grey) develops way too fast. One minute she visits him in prison and is simply his children's baby-sitter wanting him to know what's happened to the kids and then all of a sudden they're in love and married. I realize that time had passed while Bianco was in prison, and Nettie could well have kept visiting him with their relationship developing during those visits, but the transition was too sudden and jarring. Also, the opening narration of the movie turned me off. It was an early version of liberal Hollywood, where Bianco in the narration is just someone who had no choice but to turn to crime because he was poor. Boo hoo. He was a mobster. This was not a nice guy. Why are we supposed to feel sorry for him? 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kiss of Death was Richard Widmark's first movie and he certainly plays a nasty piece of work in this.A group of robbers, lead by Nick Bianco are caught out when robbing a jeweller's and he is arrested and jailed. He refuses to name the other robbers at first, but when he finds out his wife has killed herself by putting her head in an oven, he names the other robbers . He is then reunited with his children and meets a new lady and subsequently marries her and settles down. But, one of the men he reported has been released and is out for revenge. And he is very angry? One of the highlights of Kiss of Death is Richard Widmark pushing a wheelchair-bound woman down some stairs and he finds this very funny. A cruel character but he plays the part very well.The rest of the cast is lead by Victor Mature as Bianco, Coleen Gray (The Leech Woman), Brian Donlevy (The Quatermass Experiment, Quatermass 2) and Karl Malden (The Streets of San Francisco).Kiss of Death is a must see. Fantastic.Rating: 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A frightening debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film certainly made an impact on me when I first saw it in the late Forties, and having seen it a number of times since on TV, it remains one of my favourite Film Noir type movies. The frightening Richard Widmark role of Tommy Udo created an impression that would be remembered for a long time after viewing - his pushing the wheel chair down the stairs accompanied by his fiendish laugh was to be the major talking point whenever discussing the film. The storyline was taut and fast-moving, and the supporting cast was very good - even Victor Mature as Nick, was believable. Coleen Gray and Brian Donlevy did good work. Whatever happens do not confuse this with the, so-called, remake which was a flop at the box-office as it deserved to be!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Shooting script..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening shot, it's clear that KISS OF DEATH isn't just another guns 'n' gals thriller: we see a "SHOOTING SCRIPT" (identified as such by its title); placed upon said script, a handgun. Not a bad way to begin a noir thriller, eh? Victor Mature as Nick Bianco is a hood with personal ethics that preclude him ratting out his accomplices in a botched jewelry store robbery. Three years into his stretch, however, he learns that his wife has committed suicide and his two children have been sent to an orphanage. When the prison warden asks Mature if he "plays ball," Mature replies, "I'm going to." The D.A. sets a trap for Mature's accomplice, Rizzo, but Howser, Mature's crooked lawyer, sends the psychotic Tommy Udo (Richard Widmark) to silence Rizzo. But Rizzo ain't home when Udo arrives... so Udo ties Rizzo's invalid mother into her wheelchair with a length of electrical cord and shoves her down the steps. It's a particularly brutal scene, and is justifiably (in)famous. Things take a few more twists and turns before it's all over, but Mature isn't as impressed with the D.A. and his minions as he is with Udo: "He's NUTS, and he's smarter than you are," he snaps contemptuously. KISS OF DEATH is nigh flawless and deserves its status as a topnotch film noir. (Ruminating briefly, I've come up with a list of what I think are probably the top ten most memorable fictional but non-supernatural madmen and troubled women: Colonel Kurtz in APOCALYPSE NOW; Norman Bates in PSYCHO (and PSYCHO II); "John Doe" in SEVEN; "Zodiac" in DIRTY HARRY; Dennis Hopper in BLUE VELVET; Betty Davis in WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE?; Kathy Bates in MISERY; Robert Mitchum in NIGHT OF THE HUNTER; Ernest Borgnine in EMPEROR OF THE NORTH; and the entire in-bred family in THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE (the ORIGINAL version). Honorable mentions go out to the Killbillies in DELIVERENCE; the faceless trucker in DUEL; Ernest Borgnine in the original WILLARD; Boris Karloff in BEDLAM and THE BLACK CAT; Orson Welles in TOUCH OF EVIL; the kid in THE BAD SEED; the bandit leader in FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE; Paul Stewart in THE WINDOW and the Captain in Val Lewton's GHOST SHIP.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cat Chases the Rat....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the criminal world, a rat is a dirty word, and even in law enforcement, those who squeal on the criminals the police are desperate to catch are not always trusted or even liked. Paroled thief Victor Mature finds out that the best way to be a rat is to disappear, yet even that is not easy with the word of mouth spreading after he testifies against psychopathic murderer Richard Widmark, a trial that results in Widmark being acquitted because of his powerful defense. Widmark lies in waiting, like a hungry cat, waiting to pounce, playing with him like real felines do with their prey.This exciting New York City set film noir utilizes the beautiful Elmer Bernstein music "Street Scene" to unfold its story, showing the viewer what lead Mature to being imprisoned, his decisions to rat out fellow prisoner Widmark, and the impact it has on his family. Widmark, the most unforgettable film noir villain, possesses an evil laugh, which when it appears usually mean that a gun or some other method of murder will be appearing as well. This laugh becomes truly menacing in particular when he confronts the wheel-chair bound mother of another rat as to her son's whereabouts.Mature's character, while a crook, is certainly worthy of sympathy. His character witnessed the police killing of his father as a child, was forced by poverty into a life of crime, and his latest imprisonment was as a result of not being able to find a job because of his ex-con status. Then, there's his unseen wife, whom we find out can't take the pressures of poverty, the former baby sitter (Coleen Gray) who becomes Mature's new love interest, and the threat that Widmark imposes on them when his acquittal makes him a free man. This is where the suspense comes in, and a sequence where the sleepless Mature tiptoes around his house with concern for his two daughter's safety is like the ticking of the clock in "High Noon". The ending is unique in the sense that it leaves the viewer with a sense of both hope and justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very solid noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story: Nick Bianco gets caught in a jewelry store heist. The assistant district attorney offers him a deal to turn in his partners in the crime but he refuses and goes to prison. While in prison, his wife dies and his children are forced to go into an orphanage. At this point, he decides to rat on his partners.My review: The movie is shot on location in New York. This allows for very interesting setting. As expected, this movie has very solid cinematography. The 1940's seem to be the golden age of cinematography. The story is very interesting and well done. The suspenseful ending is very well done. The acting is solid. I especially enjoyed Richard Widmark's Oscar nominated supporting role of the psychotic gangster. The infamous wheelchair scene was extremely sinister and well done. (It was the main reason I watched this movie. I had seen it before in the movie Fade to Black.) Victor Mature also did a solid job as the lead actor in the film.The movie has no glaring weaknesses. The only part I didn't buy was the romance between Nick and Nettie. It happened too soon after Nick heard about his wife's death. I guess the two must have been lusting over each other when Nettie was the nanny for the children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A small landmark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A quasi-noir gangster pseudo-documentary, Kiss of Death stands up remarkably well today, in large part because of Richard Widmark's sniveling villain, who wouldn't look out of place in any modern gangster flick (his most famous scene is as shocking as it is funny). Victor Mature's performance here is every bit as good as his Doc Holliday in My Darling Clementine, and the film does a good job of managing a difficult thing - making us sympathize with a stool pigeon. Kiss of Death is also noteworthy as one of the first film to make extensive use of location filming, inspired perhaps by the Italian Neo-Realist movement. While certainly not one of the greatest films of all time (it is marred, for one thing, by the overly journalistic tone of the narration by Mature's wife), it is a must-see for anyone with an interest in the history of film noir, the gangster genre, and film itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why "Kiss of Death"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I did not get the point why this movie was called "Kiss of Death". I expect a "femme fatale" in a movie with that title but there was none. The movie is dated, an average film noir of the forties, but the acting of Richard Widmark is simply great and the wheelchair incident was quick but splendid for the forties. The loving father figure was quite overacted. Overall the movie is still worth seeing when you are a film noir fanatic. The script is OK but somewhat predictable, the shooting scene at the end was fast and quite unreal. But most of all ...the last spoken lines sounded irritating and should be better for a nowadays public. Normally I would give it a 5 but Widmark's performance tilted it up to a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Docu-Noire From Director Hathaway!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Kiss of Death" is probably best remembered for the scene in which Richard Widmark's character, Tommy Udo pushes a wheelchair bound woman (Mildred Dunnock) down a flight of stairs. But it is more than that.Shot on location in New York, Director Henry Hathaway use a documentary film noire style to give the film a reality not possible on a sound stage. He uses actual locations for the various prison scenes, buildings and offices which accentuates the realism of the story.The basic story line has small time crook Nick Bianco (Victor Mature) being arrested for a jewel robbery and being brought before Assistant District Attorney Louis D'Angelo (Brian Donlevy). D'Angelo tries to get Nick to rat out his partners in crime. No go. Nick goes to prison with the promise from his lawyer Earl Howser (Taylor Holmes) that he'll get an early parole. On the way to prison he meets the sadistic giggling psychopathic killer Udo, a friendship doomed to failure.After a personal tragedy happens while he is in prison, Nick reverses his stand and decides to contact D'Angelo and turn states evidence. He testifies against Udo and thinks that it's all over. Not so.Along the way, Nick Strikes up a romance with Nettie (Coleen Gray) and eventually marries her.Hathaway seems to have slipped a couple of things past the censors. The fact that Nettie was Nick's former baby sitter suggests that she is quite a bit younger than he and that he may have had his eye on her as a budding teenager. And because Hathaway used real locations, one might almost miss Mature flicking a cigarette butt into a real toilet in a jail cell, a no-no in those days. But not to worry, Nick and Nettie sleep in twin beds.The ending is pure Hollywood and therefore unbelievable. I mean, count the number of slugs both Nick and Udo take at the film's climax, yet both survive.I had a problem with some of the time lines in the picture. For example, Nick meets Udo on the way to prison but we don't see him again for at least a third of the film and never in the prison. When Nick turns states evidence, we casually learn that he has been away for three years and in the interim, Udo somehow has been released. And Nettie appears out of nowhere and seems to be carrying a torch for Nick in spite of their age differences.Victor Mature was always, in my opinion, a much better actor than his "hunk" image allowed. In this film he gives a powerful performance as the tragic Nick. Widmark, in his breakthrough role, steals the picture with his over the top performance as the demented killer Udo. I can't say that I agree with his make up consisting of an exaggerated over bite and fright wig used to apparently enhance his animal like mannerisms.Others in the cast include Karl Malden and Millard Mitchell as cops and John Marley as a convict friend of Nick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Victor Mature's best performance in his life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie terrified me something fierce as a child. A great deal of that fear came from watching Widmark. When I think of evil, even today, I see his face peering out from the backseat of a sedan. And yes, pushing the old lady in the wheelchair down the stairs. Note to all, Mature could act. Well. He proves it in Kiss of Death. His terror for his family's safety and his own life is very real and palpable. I can see why people list this movie in the top ten for film noir. It deserves the spot it gets. Right up there with "The Killers" 1946 version, "The Maltese Falcon", and "Key Largo". Worth watching and adding to your private collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film noir, but somewhat dated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Crime drama with Victor Mature as an armed robber who turns state's evidence. He's basically a decent guy who started off on the wrong foot in life, following the gangster's code of silence until his family needs his help and he's forced to cooperate with the D. A. Once he's goes straight and becomes a family man again all seems well until a man he testified against is released. Richard Widmark gives a deliciously evil performance as the criminal who Mature betrays. Good story, but somewhat dated, with all the cops straight shooters who are only trying to help criminals turn over a new leaf. Look for a young Karl Malden in a small role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Except for being totally the FIRST film, filmed on location in New York, it's basically a morality tale between Nick (Victor Mature) and nick (Victor Mature). Tommy Udo (Richard Widmark( is a supporting sleaze-fun guy (psychopathic) who tempts the family man. Anyway, Widmark's only nomination (it's a wonder); Mature is his most natural EVER, great supporting cast (even Mature's kids) with corruption and honestly blatantly thrown in your face every 5 minutes!.It was the Beginning and End of an Era (Film Noir). Heroes AND Villains became specialized once the Cold War, James Dean, Elvis and the whole 50's drive-in movie thought pattern began (that's why drive-in movies were invented) at a time (POST-WWII) where stuff just untangled unless you really believed (great show) in Leave it to Beaver.It goes on and on, but if you don't get movies pre-Star-Wars and pretend you like MOVIES, you need to buy a book or go meditate, because this was (mostly mainstream) ahead of his time and not just because Widmark blew everybody away as Tommy Udo (with no eyebrows) as the bad guy. Good and bad (thankfully) started being formed before Movies even got hip in the late 60's. It's a story (not far from any good Sam Shepard play) or, well, you know... Don't be trapped by generational stuff with movies, because they're here forever. Many of them (that are GREAT or Good) aren't even acknowledged) because they didn't make money for some studio. I'm done with this. Widmark is an indelible psychotic (almost likeable) persona while Victor Mature (family plan who's been in trouble) have to meet, because the authorities (who never do a proper job about these things) are just push, feebes. Wonderful film from the late 40's. Give peace a chance! But in the meantime, check out movies that were popular before you were 14. Check it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Dark and moody 1947 crime drama that has hunky and always a good guy Victor Mature playing two bit hood Nick Bianco who plays by the rules of his profession, that's written in stone, to never be a squealer and rat on your friends no matter what deal even freedom you've been given by the local D.A to do it. Having been busted in a jewelry store holdup Nick is offered a sweet deal by Assistant D.A Louie DeAngelo, Brian Dunlevy. The deal would get him off almost Scot-free if he rats out his two fellow robbers who, unlike Nick, got away. Sticking to his principles Nick takes the full ten to fifteen years in Sing Sing by keeping his mouth shut and relying on his mouthpiece lawyer, Earl Howser ,Taylor Holmes, to do the talking for him. With Howser promising Nick that he'll have him beat the rap and get parole in no time at all.While in the big house Nick got to know three time loser Johnny Udo, Richard Widmark, who became very friendly with him: They both have Howser for a lawyer. Udo tells Nick a lot of things about his life in crime including a number of murders that he committed and was never even arrested, much less convicted, for. As time goes by Nick becomes very apprehensive about what's happening back home with his wife Maria, Coleen Gray, not returning his letters. Getting the news straight from the prison grapevine Nick is shocked to find out that Maria committed suicide by sticking her head in a gas oven leaving his and her two little girls Connie &amp; Rosie orphaned.We get to see the go by the rules of the underworld Nick Bianco suddenly turn squealer to not only get his freedom but to see and take care of his little girls; Nick should have thought of that before he choose a life of crime. The price for Nicks freedom was fingering one of his fellow hoods, Rizzo, who was involved with him in the jewelery robbery at the start of the film. Concocting a story with D.A DeAngelo Nick brings out a four years old fur warehouse robbery that both he and Rizzo were involved in and DeAngelo cleverly has Nick not Rizzo indited for it.The bells go off in lawyer Howsers head thinking that Rizzo ratted out Nick, not the other way around, and sends Udo, who turned out to be Howsers enforcer, out to get the totally innocent Rizzo. Udo going to Rizzo's apartment where he lives with his mother,Mildred Dunnock, and not finding him the now psychotic and uncountable Udo throws the wheelchair bound elderly lady, tying her to her wheelchair, down a flight stairs killing her. A lot has been said about Udo's despicable actions in throwing an old and crippled woman down a flight of stairs. But the fact that "good guys" Nick Bianco and D.A DeAngelo implicated her son, who was totally innocent, of squealing on his friends which is actually what Nick did that lead to her brutal and sickening murder by a gigging and deranged Johnny Udo! This seems to have been completely overlooked by almost everyone who commented on the movie!Nick in order to earn his freedom also squeals on the maniacal Johnny Udo by revealing a number of murders that Udo told him in Sing Sing that he committed. Still with the help of Udo's high priced lawyer Earl Howsner a jury wouldn't convict him on the flimsy evidence that he brought out in court. Leaving Nick and his two young daughters opened to Udo's insane retaliation! The same kind of insanity that did in poor Mrs Rizzo.As much as I wanted to I just couldn't get myself to like Nick Bianco since what he did was anything but noble. His actions resulted in one of the most shocking crimes, Mrs. Rizzo murder, ever put in a Hollywood released motion picture. Bianco was a career criminal not an innocent bystander, who got caught up with events beyond his control, so by making him all of a sudden a good guy just to save his neck and nothing else didn't exactly move me to feel all that sorry for him. The fact that Bianco loved his daughters, Connie &amp; Rosie, and did his squealing to get out of prison in order for them to have a father at home was also a bit disingenuous. Since he should have thought about that when was committing his numerous crimes and even rejected an offer of leniency by D.A DeAngelo at the beginning of the movie which he jumped at later.Were supposed to feel for Nick because of his wife Maria killing herself. The very fact that she did was because he got himself put behind bars by keeping his mouth shut and not ratting out his fellow hoods. Which had nothing to do with Howsers, who promised to get him off, inability to take care of Maria. Nick should have taken care of that himself by not taking the rap for the jewel robbery in not making a deal with D.A DeAngelo in turning in those where were with him.The very contrive ending has Nick, now up front and acting heroic, confront Udo &amp; Co. using himself as bait in getting the crazed and giggling psycho to pull a gun on him. With the cops laying in wait in order to arrest Udo a three time loser and put him being bars for life. The film "Kiss of Death" if it showed anything to it's audience was that by choosing a life of crime the only way you can redeem yourself is by being almost as unfeeling toward your fellow criminals by fingering and ratting them out as you were towards the innocent victims, like the jewelry shop owner that Nick &amp; Co. ripped off, that you preyed upon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning and dark early noir with a satisfying moral balance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'m a fan of film noir like any other, but sometimes noir still manages to seethe into the darkest recesses of your soul and create a fearful world that's just a little hard to watch. This great little movie from 1947 features one of the most stunningly fearful monsters in all of cinema, Mr. Tommy Udo, psychopathic gangster that laughs like a hyena and glares like a demon from hell, foiled by our hero Mr. Nick Bianco, a down-on-his-luck ol' guy just trying to make ends meet in a life of crime and ending up nearly losing everything. Once Nick starts rebuilding his life, he ends up on the wrong side of Tommy, and then you're talking tension even much more famous noir didn't quite build up.For it's time, this is an extremely violent movie. For these times, it's still an extremely violent movie. There isn't quite as much of the whole "off-screen violence" thing that most movies of this era used to imply rather than show violence, in order to fit the production code. No, one scene in particular stands out a something more demented than you'd see in a Tarantino flick. The way the movie gets away with it, it seems, is that it has a very strong ethical fiber balancing the majority of the drama, and the nihilistic evil of Udo (seriously the 1940s version of Heath Ledger's Joker) is directly confronted by the everyman hero of Nick, who really is a sweety with his heart set in the right place. The voice-over narration too helps add gauze to the pain, especially with the not-quite-earned happy moralistic statement at the end. This movie would be yet another example of the genre where simply eliminated the voice-over narration would make a stunningly perfect movie, but we have what we have and it's some skillful storytelling despite itself.Calling it noir, as well, is a little iffy. It has the high-contrast lighting and the criminal underground ambiance, but the plot-structure is closer to melodrama and the social anxieties are relieved via sacrifice, getting the girl, and happy ending. However, in all other respects its a surprisingly formal early work in the genre that honestly stands out as one of the greatest examples of the form.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the film stars Victor Mature and he is excellent in film noir movies, many remember the movie NOT for him but for supporting actor Widmark. His over-the-top performance as the psychotic heavy was impossible NOT to notice!! The image of Widmark tying an old lady into a wheelchair and pushing her down the stairs while laughing maniacally is unforgettable!!! In an interview I saw with Widmark many years later, he swore that the older lady in that scene ACTUALLY took the tumble--it was no dummy in the wheelchair! With this much evil, it is obvious that bad guy turned good Mature must eventually have a show down with the psycho and his evil boss. While this isn't my favorite noir film, it's certainly ONE of the best and shouldn't be missed.LOVED that psychotic laugh!!! Heee, heee, heee, heee, heee, heee!!!!!</fullReview>

Also, his wife's suicide, though comprehensible, was still rather poorly worked out... A worthy B movie to me but no more than that. Apparently cpleen Grzy is also in The Killers (1959) which I've seen fairly recently but I can't remember her, so maybe I have to watch it again.
