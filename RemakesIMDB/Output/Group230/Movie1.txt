		<shortDescription>Deserves Better Than 5.8 IMDb Average Vote</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie and I am quite surprised by the low IMDb user voting for this film. It is certainly not Academy Award material. But the story, character development, and the acting performances are really above average. I am not a big fan of television dramas. I have never seen a single episode of CSI. I thought NYPD Blue was very overrated, except for Dennis Franz. However, I think that David Caruso is a much better movie actor than he gets credit for. This one is definitely worth seeing. It is not a stupid high-action movie like Armageddon. However, it does have some very intense and well staged scenes that will keep action movie fans happy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid crime thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ex-con Jimmy Kilmartin agrees to drive a truck of stolen cars as a favour to a friend. Whilst on the job he gets caught but refuses to role over on the others involved. Whilst in prison his wife is killed in a car crash and Jimmy leaves prison, bitter but with a determination to move on. However NYPD officer Calvin wants to use Kilmartin to get close to Little Junior Brown and get evidence to shut him down.This was one of several vehicles that was planned to turn David Caruso from a TV hit to a big screen star - as we know, it didn't work out that way. However the story is pretty solid, it doesn't break new ground and there's nothing outside of the usual crime thriller plot to surprise you but it's really quite good. At times it's a little dull because it is so straight forward but it's mostly entertaining.Caruso, for all his current lack of success, is actually very good. The problem is that he's good by doing the same "NY Irish tough but fair" role that he did in NYPD Blue, King of New York, Bodycount and most films he's done! It's good but I don't think he can do anything else. Jackson has presence as he always does and the support cast is really well filled out with people like Helen Hunt, Stanley Tucci, Rapaport, Philip Baker Hall, Ving Rhames. Nicolas Cage's Little Junior is a mixed bag. At some points he is effective but for the most part he's horribly OTT and hammy. His character is full of ticks and eccentricities that at the end of the day that's all Cage has to do.Overall this is a solid thriller with no surprises. Caruso fans (like me) will like it regardless because it's Caruso doing his usual role. But others may not be so easily made to overlook the weaknesses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Caruso and a beefed up Nicholas Cage star in this remake of the 1947 noir film..In this one David Caruso, on parole, is talked into doing a job to help his cousin, when he is busted, his cousin takes advantage of him and his wife Helen Hunt. Caruso is offered a deal by a slippery DA with political aims, played with the usual excellence by Stanley Tucci. Caruso then discovers the meaning of the word politics and seeks revenge on those who betrayed him. An underrated movie that didnt get much press when released (probably due to Caruso's controversial exit from NYPD Blue) this film builds the suspense and keeps you involved and interested.Caruso, the Cagney for the 90s, plays his part great with a tension you can feel. All the other roles are played well in this sleeper movie.. Well recommended Kiss of Death rates a 8</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better film than most give it credit for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone agrees that the casting was marque. And that it has great source material. But I feel it gets a bum rap with critics. And Nicolas Cage was exactly what the film needed. I thought so then and I think so now. Color, flash, and style. Something out of the ordinary to give it some desperately needed weight. And Cage makes weight. Literally. That is the strongest look I had seen since Stallone did "First Blood, Part II". Cage is a physical bull and it's impressive. I wouldn't have recognized him if I hadn't seen the trailer with his name on it beforehand. If you never saw this, see it. For no other reason than to be scared of Nic Cage. I was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Barbet Schroeder hands us his scariest impression of a violent world since the "Self Portrait" of Idi Amin. Richard Price's script clicks along like a BQE on hardboiled rails. Both are aided by distinctive, urgent characterizations from just about everybody. This is at least as good as the original.There are, of course, many guilty pleasures here. Helen Hunt hit by a truck in the second reel, Michael Rapaport right-crossed to death, and Sam Jackson shot in the face are what genre pictures are all about. It's Godzilla stomping Tokyo, mortar fire at Omaha Beach, a Peacemaker laying out the sheriff - the lurid fulfillment of forbidden wishes. But a good B movie must earn these cheap thrills: a good B movie must entertain the higher faculties to deserve tumbling skyscrapers and spurts of blood. None of Michael Bay earns its shocks. Most of Eastwood doesn't; some of Friedkin, half of Tony Scott, most of Ford, and nearly all of Hawks do. Having proved his ability in the American idioms of the courtroom drama ("Reversal of Fortune") and, to a lesser extent, the stalker picture ("Single White Female"), here Schroeder demands efficiency and style of every technician and artist and delivers a sharp crime thriller.This works because it's the best kind of melodrama. The characters do not make absurd decisions; the plot suits the story, instead of the other way around, as in almost every Schwarzenegger vehicle. No decision is without consequence. Nobody wins, until the very silly last five minutes, by which time the real climax has already occurred. These are bad people in bad situations behaving, for the most part, very badly. There is pathos without sentiment, virtue without idealism, sacrifice without honor. Chiefly there is redemption without cynicism. Ben Hecht would approve. Henry Hathaway would not recognize it as proper American film-making. Perhaps it isn't.David Caruso is as good as he is capable of being in the central role, and the character's plight is sympathetic enough. Caruso is always competent, but hanging a whole film around his neck is a bad call because he's hard to like. (For best use of Caruso, see "King of New York" and "Session 9".) So it's Nicolas Cage's movie in spite of his own deficiencies. Cage's forte is light comedy; he is naturally brilliant at it, but not at the virile heroic stuff he makes all his money on. No matter how big he gets or how hard he stares, his Little Junior isn't as creepy as Widmark's little Tommy Udo. Still Cage's character's unpredictable behavior and inflated physical presence are enough to overpower most of the performances sharing screen time with his. The support puts in a good day's work, though - Hunt is less affected than usual, Jackson less cartoonish, Stanley Tucci less pretentious. They all have Price to thank for credible motivation and clever things to say. They should also thank Schroeder for not being Roger Spottiswoode, Joel Schumacher or George Cosmotos.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kiss of Death boasts an impressive cast, authentic locales, and a gritty, accessible storyline, but it still comes across as an asthmatic remake of the film noir classic. Nobody "stars" in KOD; rather, David Caruso, Helen Hunt, Nicholas Cage, Samuel L. Jackson, Ving Rhames, and Kathryn Erbe all put in good, workmanlike performances that just don't catch fire.I enjoyed Kiss of Death ten years ago when I rented it. What made it enjoyable again was seeing people I had forgotten about--a young Hunt, commanding on screen, an obscure Jackson, Cage almost unrecognizable, and Caruso, long before he decided to trade in acting for the ridiculous posturing he does on the boneheaded CSI: Miami.Yet, the movie never really jells. We know the story well so we expect something better to make KOD stand out. "Workmanlike" just isn't enough.I'd still recommend it, though. The freshness of the talent might be enough for you. And Cage, ripped and psychotic is so different from his breezy action roles of the last half decade. You may find a gem here!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad for a makeover.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Hecht's original story had enough strength to be carried over into this successful remake, aided by a strong cast. I'm not sure how much the modernization of the script adds to it, but it's worth seeing.Caruso is a con who, out of concern for his family, rats on some friends when the prosecutor promises him freedom. Things go legally awry and Caruso finds himself and his family being hunted by the chief thug (Nicholas Cage) while the police (Stanley Tucci and Steven Jackson) provide a simulacrum of protection. Finally Caruso takes matters in his own hands, confronts Cage in a night club, and is beaten like hell before the cops arrive and put things back in order.The original script depicted what now seems like an old-fashioned model of the justice system. Good cops vs. bad guys, with the good guys hampered by laws that are too lax. This is brought up to date in that EVERYBODY is corrupt in one way or another, with a few exceptions. Caruso is family-oriented, though a con, and his family and Jackson have their hearts in the right place. But the agents of social control -- both federal and state -- are petty and bickering. Tucci, the head cop, isn't really interested in bad guy Cage. He wants a federal judgeship or judgehood or judgedom. It's a much more cynical model of the justice system.The brutality quotient is cubed. Somebody's brains get shot out and splattered all over somebody. Or a suspected snitch is beaten to death with fists and his blood splashes against the wall.I think the earlier version is superior. For one thing, it was an original, not a copy. And some of the performances here don't measure up to the original's. Kathryn Erbe -- great name in German, by the way -- is a pretty and talented actress but she does not exude the winsome cheerful devotion of the sexy, stupid, beautiful Colleen Gray. David Caruso is a more convincing New Yorker than Louisvilleian Victor Mature was, but his performance is understated compared to Mature's nervous clumsiness. Some of the roles are just differently interpreted. Where Brian Donleavy was a stolidly ethical prosecutor, Stanley Tucci is transparently reptilian. Who would believe Tucci when he claims to be "a man of honor"? And, of course, there is nothing in this remake that looks even vaguely like Richard Widmark's Tommy Udo in his wolfman wig, nor any scene quite as terrible as Widmark's pushing the old lady strapped in her wheelchair down the stairs. At the time THAT was more shocking a scene that all the current bloodshed and poundings put together. That's what I mean by "original." Still, not a bad movie on its own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Crime Thriller with Plenty of Atmosphere and Offbeat Humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the best way to approach this movie is on its own terms rather than as a remake of the 1940s film. In any case, it merely follows the general story outline of the earlier picture. What makes it altogether new is Richard Price's screenplay, Barbet Schroeder's direction, a great lineup of actors, and location shooting in some of New York City's seediest and most squalid areas.Along with the great locations, what really provides the atmosphere is Price's writing. Once again he shows his down to the ground knowledge of the characters, mannerisms, and lingo of the creeps and hoodlums in the big city underworld, and the law enforcement people who deal with them. And there is also Price's trademark offbeat humor.While the earlier film gave us Richard Widmark as a really scary psycho, in this later film Richard Price has given us Little Junior Brown, a bulked-up killer with a child's mind and an abiding faith in the nostrums of New Age philosophy.What a delight when Little Junior, fresh from committing murder, asks our hero to take the next day off so they can get together and "talk about life and stuff"! Or when he urges him to settle on an acronym that will give shape to his identity. (Little Junior's is B-A-D--for "Balls, Attitude, Direction.") Nicholas Cage is often accused of playing over the top, but in the case of Little Junior, over the top is the way to go.There are also good performances by Stanley Tucci and Samuel L. Jackson. Tucci excels in portraying charming snakes. When he leers and sneers, it is impossible to keep from watching him.This movie was really very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, But Just Too Hard, Too Nasty For Most People</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not the 1947 film but a 1995 re-make of the famous gangster flick of the same name. While the classic film had one brutally nasty guy, this one has a whole cast full of them....too nasty, frankly. I watched this once and was fairly interested in it. A couple of years later, took a second look and found it so sleazy and I couldn't finish it.David Caruso, who obtained a lot more fame in television shows than movies, still was interesting for me to watch as he played Victor Mature's old role. Caruso is one of the better actors I've seen when it comes to expressing his emotions just by his facial looks. It seems fashionable to knock him, but I've always been a fan of his work.Nicholas Cage plays Richard Widmark's psycho character "Tommy Udo" but is called "Little Junior Brown" in this film. Personally, I liked Widmark's performance and character much more.A lot of people, especially 20-somethings, like these modern tough films with brutal characters and tons of profanity, but the characters in this movie were so nasty that the film never really caught on with anybody. It certainly had one thing going for it: a very good cast that also included Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Rapaport, Ving Rhames, Stanley Tuccki, Helen Hunt and Kathryn Erbe.To summarize: it's not that bad: it just has too hard an edge to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid '90s Crime Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My friend made me watch this and I found it to be a surprisingly entertaining movie. It's a remake of a 1940s film noir, but I haven't seen that one. Here David Caruso plays the typical gangster-gone-straight in order to support his new family, but one of his friends (played by Michael Rappaport) pulls him in for one last deal which (unsurprisingly) screws him over big time.The casting here is absolutely phenomenal. The performances by all the lead actors are some of their best: Nicholas Cage, Stanley Tucci, David Caruso and Michael Rappaport all bring serious color to the story. It is clear here that the careful casting makes a big difference. I'd like to say one performance in particular stands out (maybe Nicholas Cage, in one of his best roles ever) but everyone pulls their weight. Michael Rappaport, despite staying in his typical character role, manages to play the most loathsome character in the film! Even the villains have more humanity to them than he does...The story is good too. It's not original, but very well done. Many classic crime twists are provided in ways one doesn't expect and there are some plot points that are only alluded to, not blatantly shown (i.e. the reason certain characters get knocked off, etc.). It also gives us a good rundown on the inside of a corrupt court system which only protects ex-cons if there's a profit to be made.And to top it off, despite the criminal element and violence, there is a cool sense of humor to several scenes. Little Junior's (Nicholas Cage) mourning scene stands out as a highlight. And then the way the movie ends, you'd think you were watching Beethoven or something. Hee hee, and Stanley Tucci was in that one too! It's not some critically acclaimed showboating from the '90s, like American Beauty, The Usual Suspects, and so on, but it is a solid little '90s period piece.6.5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kiss of Death is directed by Barbet Schroeder and collectively written by Ben Hecht, Charles Lederer, Eleazar Lipsky and Richard Price. It stars David Caruso, Nicolas Cage, Samuel L. Jackson, Helen Hunt, Ving Rhames, Stanley Tucci, Kathryn Erbe, Michael Rapaport and Anthony Heald. Music is by Trevor Jones and cinematography by Luciano Tovoli. Reformed ex-con Jimmy Kilmartin (Caruso) reluctantly helps out his cousin transporting stolen cars but gets caught and ends up taking the fall for the whole caper. Back in prison and missing his wife and child, Jimmy gets offered a lifeline if he is prepared to go undercover with the police to bring down psychotic crime boss Little Junior Brown (Cage). A loose remake of the excellent 1947 film noir of the same name, Schroeder's Kiss of Death is slightly better than the iffy reputation afforded it. Yes it's more solid than anything resembling truly compelling, but it wears its noir heart on its sleeve and is very well performed by an impressive cast. Caruso's Kilmartin is a classic noir protagonist, a man who tries to go straight but gets dragged into a world of crime and shifty undercover machinations after doing one honest intention favour. From the point he agrees to help out Ronnie Gannon (Rapaport a jumping bean performance), he loses what he holds most dear and continually gets pulled from pillar to post by everyone around him. He's basically a good guy that fate has dealt a deadly hand, even when he gets a second chance at happiness it's not long before the door knocks and he's thrust into a deadly undercover game where he will be lucky to escape with his life intact. A lot has been made of TV star Caruso's unsuccessful attempt at breaking into films, with some believing that his performance here is mostly to blame. Yet in the context of a noir protagonist his performance is perfectly good, in fact it's a very subtle turn that isn't short on brooding intensity. That he is overshadowed by the likes of Cage (wonderfully on full tilt overdrive as a nut-case) and Jackson (calm yet assured presence) is no bad thing, especially since both come with noir infected ticks (Jackson has a continuous weeping eye/Cage has a phobia about metal in his mouth). Caruso does good here, bringing the character to life without histrionics, he helps the audience understand his frustration as he spins in his vortex of disharmony. Nobody is done any favours by a screenplay that doesn't take chances, and at times it comes close to standing still in the mid-section, while the climax is a little underwhelming. But for a piece of pulpy neo-noir it has enough about it to make it worth a look. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caruso should try another movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an original take on the 1947 classic. What is has in common with that film is the central character played by David Caruso, who, when I first viewed the film, thought was ridiculous, but on second viewing have been able to appreciate the performance and the film much more. Like most modern crime-action films, it has a dynamite start with a massive heist of new cars that ends in a bloody shootout with the cops, but maintains the pace with acutely drawn underworld characterizations, especially Nicholas Cage as crime boss/killer "Junior Brown", a role that has Cage playing a muscle bound sadistic asthmatic running a topless bar. Equally impressive is Michael Rappaport's part as small time opportunistic chop shop operator Ronnie Gannon, a dangerous combination of con-game artist and violent felon. The film's biggest problem is the turf battle between the various cops which in one bizarre scene has them all gathered at a night-time meeting in a hard to believe showdown. But Caruso delivers, Cage is in a one of a kind role, and the film reeks with grit as it careens through its weird plot from heist to prison, to revenge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the scoring for this film and thought 5.9/10 was just plain wrong and felt the need to give my opinion.Personally, I'm quite a fan of those film noirs/crime dramas from the 40/50s, mainly because of their tense atmosphere and gritty realism and so with this being a remake of a classic original, this was right up my street.All I'm going to say about the movie is that the plot is fast paced, exciting, with several twists and keeps you involved right through to the end.David Caruso got panned by critics for his role in this and I felt that was unjust as I thought his performance and demeanour were just right for the character he was playing.The rest of the cast is great and with some great performances by Ving Rhames, Nic Cage, Stanley Tucci, and in particular Anthony Heald as the scumbag lawyer.As a previous reviewer said, perhaps some people were put off this film by the sheer nastiness of some of the characters, but try to put that to one side and enjoy the ride.I'd probably give this movie a solid 8/10, but because of the overall rating I'm going to give it a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>America has the best justice money can buy- meaning gentry that pay for the privilege of justice receive it and normal citizens will see justice only by pure accident. Here is a normal citizen who served his time but continues to be harassed by police- a common tactic of pigs- since they are too stupid to be detectives- they make their informants do all the dirty work of investigation under penalty of return to prison on some lies and setups-ya know- who they gonna believe? Me or you? This is the framework this movie operates in- the reality that most cops and lawyers are total scum that need two neat in the back of the head, and justice is a fairy tale in America.Add in a little action jackson moments to spice it up and we have a watchable movie that is reasonably OK- not stellar- but watchable to the finish and a decent job of acting by our lead. This is one of the few action flicks that actually tries to do some acting- our lead does a great job- his supporting actors do OK- but not great.All in all- I would watch this movie for a matinée by myself. One of the humorous things in this movie is you see Nicholas Cage bulked up as a guido in a disco.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicholas Cage is hilarious in ridiculous crime caper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You want to know the best joke I've heard lately? The Kiss of Death remake. Despite having great source material to work from (that being Henry Hathaway's 1947 original), Barbet Schroeder's film might as well have been a comedy, as the level of incompetence on display really is mind blowing. The film features a whole range of well known stars, and almost every single one of them is heinously miscast. Nicholas Cage delivers the silliest role of his career as the babyish gangster 'Little Junior'. Cage's character is this film's answer to Richard Widmark's Tommy Udo, but unlike Widmark; Cage just can't do the extreme psychotic, and succeeds only in making a fool of himself. Samuel L. Jackson isn't given room to breathe, while Helen Hunt, Michael Rapaport and Ving Rhames are entirely wasted. Perhaps the biggest casting mistake was giving David Caruso the lead role. It's hard not to laugh while he's trying to look hard, and the ginger actor looks completely ridiculous throughout. The only actor in the entire film that has been well cast is Anthony Heald (Silence of the Lambs' Dr Chilton), who has a very small role as a lawyer. Kiss of the Death is one of the clearest examples of casting with the poster in mind that I've ever seen.The plot follows an unlucky guy who gets arrested after taking 'one last job' as a favour to his friend. While on the inside, he is asked to rat out his accomplices, and but won't. However, he changes his mind when it comes to the end of his sentence (oh yes). What made the original great was that the story was tight, and by concentrating on just a handful of characters; the audience was able to care for their plight. This movie doesn't benefit from that, as the film needs a whole load of characters so that a load of big names can star, and it harms the film as the whole thing is far too convoluted. Not much thought has gone into any scene in this film either, and certain plot threads seem to come out of nowhere; the lead character's relationship with the babysitter being a good example of an idea that the film simply throws at you. You really need to stretch your imagination with this movie, as several things don't make sense; and the fact that all in all, this film is bad ensures that stretching the imagination isn't easy. The ending is similar to that of the original, but here we don't get the impression that it's come about as a result of the characters; and Samuel L. Jackson's last moment on screen throws mud in the eye of the dark tone that a story like this should have. All I can say is that Kiss of Death is actually an apt name for this film, as Barbet Schroeder and co have embraced a good idea and killed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, underrated crime drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mostly gripping crime drama with a good script and a great cast. This is David Caruso's best movie by far as a leading man, the reason he left NYPD Blue, and it portended a good career to follow. Well, his movie career tanked but this is still a good character study and underrated neo noir entry. Cage is all breathy snarl and wonderful menace in the flashy sociopath role originated by Richard Widmark. Hard to imagine assembling a backup cast with Ving Rhames, Helen Hunt, Stanley Tucci, Michael Rapaport and Samuel L. Jackson these days on this budget, and they all put in nice turns. Probably worth a shot if you are a fan of modern noir and gritty crime dramas, though it does peter out a bit with the too-convenient denouement. Cut from the same tough cloth as other sleeper modern noir movies like DEEP COVER and ROMEO IS BLEEDING. "You F#&amp;$ with the bull, you get the horns." 7.5 / 10 Would rate higher if not for the too-cute ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great thriller is "Kiss of Death"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Kiss of Death" is a great thriller from 1995. It is directed by Barbet Schroeder. And it is written by Eleazar Lipsky with screenplay by Ben Hecht. It is currently available on NetFlix Instant Download Streaming. Ex-con Jimmy Kilmartin agrees to drive a truck of stolen cars as a favor to a friend. Whilst on the job he gets caught but refuses to role over on the others involved. Whilst in prison his wife is killed in a car crash and Jimmy leaves prison, bitter but with a determination to move on. However NYPD officer Calvin wants to use Kilmartin to get close to Little Junior Brown and get evidence to shut him down. This was one of several vehicles that was planned to turn David Caruso from a TV hit to a big screen star - as we know, it didn't work out that way. However the story is pretty solid, it doesn't break new ground and there's nothing outside of the usual crime thriller plot to surprise you but it's really quite good. At times it's a little dull because it is so straight forward but it's mostly entertaining. Caruso, for all his current lack of success, is actually very good. The problem is that he's good by doing the same "NY Irish tough but fair" role that he did in NYPD Blue, King of New York, Bodycount and most films he's done! It's good but I don't think he can do anything else. Jackson has presence as he always does and the support cast is really well filled out with people like Helen Hunt, Stanley Tucci, Rapaport, Philip Baker Hall, Ving Rhames. Nicolas Cage's Little Junior is a mixed bag. At some points he is effective but for the most part he's horribly OTT and hammy. His character is full of ticks and eccentricities that at the end of the day that's all Cage has to do. Overall this is a solid thriller with no surprises. Caruso fans (like me) will like it regardless because it's Caruso doing his usual role. But others may not be so easily made to overlook the weaknesses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can't go around hitting the police....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jimmy Kilmartin's an ex-con who is predictably trying to go straight. But his friend's life is threatened, so he obliges to do one last job. The job is for Little Junior Brown, a violent and powerful villain. When things go wrong, Jimmy is left to do the time, and his whole life is turned upside-down.But the cops won't leave Jimmy alone when he gets out, as they want to get Little Junior....It s quite funny that David Caruso was trying to be the next big thing in Hollywood. In 1995 he had two pretty high profile releases, this, and the arguably better 'Jade'.When I first saw this back in 1995, I thought this was a pretty smart crime thriller. It had plot twists aplenty, a good story, and was reminiscent of Carlitos Way. But I was seventeen, and I thought the movie 'Congo' was cutting edge.Seeing now, years later, its apprentice that the film isn't trying hard enough to be anything different. Its a crime thriller, nothing more, and it's the same old story line of the guy wanting to go straight, but the police won't let up, and neither will the criminals.It's pretty much the cinematic version of Pacinos line in GF Pt 3, 'just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in'.The performances are good though, particularly Tucci and Cage. Caruso wasn't ready for the big time, and the fact that he had such wonderful support, dint help either.Good, but not as clever as it thinks it is...The Boris Johnson of movies....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicolas Cage, Samuel Jackson &amp; Helen Hunt. What else do ya need?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's refreshing to see such old movies now for a change. A young, tough-built Nicolas Cage as a mean gangsta, the pretty Helen Hunt in a 2-minute role as an innocent house wife, a very lean Samuel Jackson as a just cop, and of course David Caruso too. All these actors are huge stars today but if in the mid 90's I were to tell them about their super-stardom future, they might have choked in laughter.About the movie, it's a neat good guy vs the underworld story, very engaging from start to end. The best act was Nicolas Cage's who chills as a baddie. Wish I could have seen more of Helen Hunt though.Verdict: No big shakes but still a cool thriller that's worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine film, with many merits.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it doesn't have the originality or gravitas of the original, upon which this version is based, this is a fine film which was much maligned on it's original release. David Caruso is in fine teeth grinding form as the parolee, wringing out every last drop of the pain caused by the death of his wife and the trauma of separation from his baby daughter and using this to drive onward with his revenge on the criminals responsible.The film also gives Nicholas Cage, yet another, opportunity to over act as the gang bosses' lunatic son, which is amoungst the more disappointing aspects of the film, unfortunately the largest disappointment was provided by, the usually solid and brilliant, Samuel L Jackson as the cop intent on proving Caruso's claims, to be a crook gone good, as a lie. However there is a fantastic cameo from, soon to be Oscar winner, Helen Hunt as Caruso's alcoholic wife.All together a very well presented film with moody visuals and gritty dialogue. It doesn't have much of a twist, but that isn't an absolute in film making. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kiss of DeathA loose remake of the classic 1947 film noir, this version boasts an impressive cast: Nicolas Cage, Samuel L. Jackson, Helen Hunt, Ving Rhames, Stanley Tucci as well as the underrated David Caruso. As Kilmartin's first wife Bev, Helen Hunt is particularly good, and one feels the film loses intensity when her character shortly disappears. Unfortunately the presence of all this talent doesn't make this film anything more than a commercially entertaining 90 minutes or so. Schroeder sacrifices many of the strengths of the original production to create a thriller with a much more contemporary impact, but average results. Whereas Hathaway's film was praised at the time for its documentary feel, Schroeder's location work remains fairly anonymous, excepting the impressive crane and tracking shot through the junkyard over which the opening credits are played out. At the heart of the film is the character of Kilmartin. Dragged back into the underworld and danger by the call of an imagined debt, his journey is a gradual one from a position of weakness and entrapment to that of strength and liberation. As he says later to Junior,"whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger" - hardly original philosophy, but his growing assertiveness confirms the truth of this inspiration. Kilmartin has to overcome in turn his injuries, his imprisonment, his wife's crash, betrayal and his own fear before he finds his feet again. His adventures become a means to recover his self-respect, to regain personal equilibrium, a result only achieved in the final scene. While Caruso fittingly provides the most complex and understated performance in the film, the opposite is true of Cage, who plays the asthmatic and hulking Junior - a psychopathic thug with a bizarre aversion to eating with metal cutlery. Junior says that he has taken 'Balls, Attitude, Direction' as his personal acronym (a somewhat laboured plot point when it reappears later on the forehead of Kilmartin's kidnapped daughter and then his front door). BAD is too strong an assessment of Cage's uncontrolled performance, which remains entertaining and memorable, but he has been better. His casual 'press-ups' with the dancer for instance, his ritualistic slaughter of Kilmartin's cousin, or his asthma spray (which at times recalls Frank's oxygen mask tripping in Blue Velvet), remain in the mind long after the rest of the plot has been forgotten. Kilmartin's nervousness when he next meets Junior, and the edgy scenes which follow between the two, are among the better things in the film, mainly due to the psychotic traits Cage gives his character and the resulting tension.Calvin, played here by the excellent Samuel L. Jackson, has little to do. Excluded from Kilmartin's final plans except for his timely arrival to arrest Junior, he grows increasingly redundant. The original gravitas, accompanying his character's internalised rage, evaporates through the plot's meanderings. Significantly, although present, he is largely excluded in detail from the subplot concerning the ambitious DA (Tucci). Having said that, Calvin's weeping eye is an excellent touch, its false tears reflecting his bitterness after the shooting. But still we long to see him in more extended interaction with the persecuted hero. Instead he is largely wasted, a symbol of many of this film's missed opportunities.Those looking for a reasonably exciting thriller will enjoy this sufficiently to make it worth their while. Those wanting to see the real thing, albeit somewhat different in detail, will be advised to seek out giggling Richard Widmark and fraught Victor Mature in the atmospheric original.</fullReview>

This particular cast includes David Caruso, Helen Hunt, Michael Rappaport, Samuel L. Jackson, Paul Calderon, Ving Rhames (three "Pulp Fiction" alums), and Nic Cage. How can you go wrong?

		<fullReview>Jimmy Kilmartin (David Caruso) is trying to stay clean in Queens. He and his wife Bev (Helen Hunt) have a baby. His cousin Ronnie Gannon (Michael Rapaport) pulls him back into working for Little Junior Brown (Nicolas Cage). Jimmy is arrested. He doesn't rat out Little Junior and in exchange, Bev is taken care of. Bev is forced to work for Ronnie as he cheats her out of the money. Big Junior Brown (Philip Baker Hall) is Junior's father and they own the strip club Baby Cakes. Ronnie gets the recovering alcoholic Bev drunk and she wakes up in his bed the next morning. In shock, she drives off and dies in a car accident. During the funeral, Bev's sister Rosie (Kathryn Erbe) tells Jimmy the truth. To get Ronnie, Jimmy rats out the crew except Ronnie. Believing Ronnie is the actual rat, Little Junior has him killed. Year later with parole coming up, police detective Frank Zioli (Stanley Tucci) threatens to out Jimmy to Little Junior. Jimmy is forced to be an informant on Little Junior. With Big Junior dead, Little Junior is the new boss and the police is actually targeting his business partner Omar (Ving Rhames). Meanwhile, Jimmy has remarried to Rosie and trying to carve out a normal life.Nicolas Cage steals this movie for both good and bad. His character is unforgettable. However, it's so big that the movie loses the thread of an intense noir thriller. David Caruso is fine and so is almost everybody else. Michael Rapaport continues his jittery sleazy bad-influence character. The story is a little long trying to do too much. For example, it would cost nothing to keep Bev around for the whole movie. With a couple of tweaks, Bev and Rosie's characters could have been combined. With some simplification and compression, this would a much tighter thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Barbet Schroeder has not had what anyone would call a very fruitful American period. In between the Wilderesque black comedy masterwork REVERSAL OF FORTUNE and the pedestrian MURDER BY NUMBERS came this in-name-only remake of Henry Hathaway's 1947 classic. David Caruso, possessing none of the presence or gravitas it takes to carry a film, stars as a con trying to go straight but is tripped up by his involvement with degenerate gangster Nicolas Cage (as Little Junior Brown -- that name being one of the few clever things in the film). Schroeder directs the film at a brisk clip but it's all for naught; the material is just nothing special. Appearances by Helen Hunt, Stanley Tucci (as a self-serving prosecutor), Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Rappaport add very little.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tale of the Tape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(There are Spoilers) Trying to go straight and raise a family ex-convict &amp; car thief Jimmy Killmartin, David Caruso, gets back into his chosen profession by trying to keep his sleazy cousin Ronnie, Michael Rapaport, from getting his brains beat out by his demanding and not too kindly boss Little Junior, Nicolas Cage. Ronnie wants Jimmy to drive an 18 wheeler loaded with stolen cars for his chop-shop business. As you would expect Jimmy gets caught by a cop sting that results in one of the NYPD detectives Calvin Hart, Samuel L. Jackson, getting a bullet in his head but miraculously surviving.Even though Jimmy was set up and deserted by Ronnie he lives by an unbroken and moral code not to rat on any of his fellow hoods. But that's quickly broken when Jimmy's wife Bev, Helen Hunt,is killed in a car crash that Ronnie was responsible for. It turned out that instead of looking after Bev and her and Jimmy's infant daughter Corinna, Lindsay J. Wrinn, Ronnie was taking advantage of Bev while Jimmy was locked up. Also the day she was killed Ronnie got Bev drunk and took her home to his place for both fun and games. Bev waking up from her alcohol-induced sleep ran out of Ronnie's place into her car and, still being under the influence, drove into an oncoming truck killing herself.Realizing what Ronnie did Jimmy agrees with the State prosecutor Frank Zioli, Stanley Tucci, to rat on his fellow car-thieves at a closed door grand jury hearing implicating even himself in number of car robberies but slyly keeps Ronnie's name out of it. The news of the car-theft gang being ratted out by someone from the inside gets back to Little Junior from his mobbed-up lawyer Jack Gold, Anthony Heald. It's then agreed that it had to be Ronnie, since he was the only member who wasn't indicted, who ratted on his gang and in no time at all Little Junior pay him a friendly visit with a half dozen of his goons that turns out to be Ronnie's funeral.Having served his time Jimmy is released from Sing Sing Prison but the aggressive State procurator Zioli has plans for him to get Little Junior in a sting operation which will result in him getting a federal judgeship. Going to Little Junior's Baby Cakes strip club Jimmy has a wire planted on him by the police in order to get evidence. Jimmy gets friendly with the mob boss only to be later shaken down in the club's bathroom to see if he's working for the cops or not. Jimmy realizing what was going down threw away his wire before Little Junior and his boys got to him. As crazy as Little Junior is he still strikes me as a pretty smart cookie being able to sense if he's being set up in a sting operation, with a wiretap. But later he act's so stupidly that he guns down in cold blood an undercover federal agent Omar, Ving Khames, right in front of a shocked Jimmy who's got a wire on him. This in the end can lead to Little Junior to be indited and arrested for murder one. With Jimmy having the incriminating tape it looked like a slam dunk to convict Little Junior but his lawyer Jack Gold comes to his rescue having the evidence thrown out on a technicality; Little junior killed a federal agent thinking that he was hood like himself and even more convincing it was in self-defense! With Little Junior out free Jimmy, who's cover was blown, is now a marked man and with only Det. Hart, who's since become bonded with him, willing to help Jimmy it looks as if it's only a matter of time before he's history. But unknown to Little Junior as well as the double-crossing state procurator Zioli, who promised Jimmy that he and his family would be protected , Jimmy had devised a plan to keep himself alive. And that plan is to use the same method that get him into hot water to get him out of it: the wiretap.The David Caruso came across completely colorless as Jimmy Killmartin showing in most of his scenes almost no emotion at all. The final scene in the movie showed that he, or Jimmy, also wasn't all that bright even though he miraculously survived a assassination attempt on his life. NIcholas Cage as the mob boss Little Junior has a very serious asthma condition but looks and act in the pink of health. He even lifts heavy weights, as well as showgirls, 15 at a time without even breathing hard. Little Junior also viciously beats people up sometimes to death which is very strenuous exorcise for an asthmatic. With the only sign of his asthma condition is the occasionally asthmatic aerosol spry that he uses to keep himself from possibly suffocating to death.Samual L. Jackson as Det. Hart is totally wasted as the good cop who risk his job and life in setting up his bosses in the federal government and NYPD. I also found it odd that Jimmy's wiretaps on both Little Junior and prosecutor Zioli had such an impact of bringing them both down to earth, Little Junior in jail and Zioli facing a serious ethics charge, that can also put him behind bars. When the wiretaps were done without a court order not only making them illegal but even criminal on Jimmy's part! Just earlier in the movie a court ordered wiretap that resulted in getting evidence of the murder of a federal agent, by Little Junior, was thrown out of the same courtroom on the most flimsiest of legal technicalities. But these totally illegal and uncalled for wiretaps, on Little Junior and Zioli, were allowed to stand!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just your average action flick...nothing more, nothing less</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very ho-hum movie, failing to inspire nor draw the audience in. I felt like a casual observer at best, which left ample room for me to critique the story.I had issues with a lot of the pivotal plot points that I felt disrupted the pace. For example, how can a woman in a car going not more than 3 mph get killed by a dump truck on a residential street going not more than 35 mph?? That took me completely out of the movie. After that, the pace was unforgivingly slow and never really seemed to pick up.Most of the parts were delivered as expected, however Cage's character (Junior) seemed a bit too eccentric, though I'm unclear as to whether that was more to do with poor writing or improvisation on Cage's part. I couldn't understand why Calvin (Jackson) blamed Jimmy (Caruso) for getting shot when he clearly yelled no and tried to block the shot nor how their relationship progressed later on.In short, there's nothing in particular that will make the film stand out in your mind, nor that might give you cause to ever want to see it again.VERDICT: Barely entertaining action flick, which is pretty hard to achieve. I'd stay away unless you're a Cage fan and just have to satisfy your curiosity (like me). NOTE: I'm also a Helen Hunt fan, so I thought this'd be worth a look.5.0 out of 10.0</fullReview>

Jackson acting spiteful, Helen Hunt trying to stay alive, Ving Rhames looking evil as ever, and a pre-"Murder One" Stanley Tucci as oily as can be.Warning: this movie is violent in an up-close-and-personal way, not like the average shoot-'em-up.</fullReview>

Maybe low key performances aren't what draw people into theaters, but they should be. I had not seen the original 1947 version, but now that I have, I still feel this film stands well on its own, and that's more than you can say for a lot of other remakes.This should have propelled Caruso to other movie roles.

		<fullReview>I've got my asbestos suit on already, but I thought this was Nicholas Cage's finest two hours. His transformation and portrayal in this film rank up there with DeNiro's in 'Raging Bull'. Granted, this film is not for those who were looking to see Cage reprise his role in 'Raising Arizona'. This is a hard-boiled film, every bit as vicious as Scorcese's 'Goodfellas' and it remains in my Top Ten of crime films, along with the Godfathers and the Goodfellas.Nick Cage is a revelation here, and Caruso is every bit as serviceable. I suspect that critics didn't like this film because they preferred the lighter, surreal performances that preceded it, and weren't prepared to see him in a straight drama, much less the *absolutely frightening* role of Junior Brown. The flip-side of this is that he's more than able to play 'dark' characters. If his Uncle Francis (Coppola), Scorcese or Abel Ferrara want to employ him for a gritty role, he's more than capable of taking it on.8/10 for an absolutely *iconic* performance from Cage.</fullReview>

After watching this movie, you will never look at a raincoat the same way again.

		<shortDescription>Where is Tommy Udo When You Need Him?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the 1947 original as a kid, nothing made an impression on me as did Richard Widmark as Tommy Udo. This new version tried to duplicate the menace of that character with Nick Cage playing a somewhat loony gangster, Little Junior Brown. Cage does a great job with the character, but is no Tommy Udo. But that is the gist of this version's problems: casting.We have David Caruso sleepwalking his way through as Jimmy Kilmartin, sort of the hero of the tale. Caruso is a truly one-dimensional actor. He has one expression, one tone of voice, one loss of composure schtick. Despite his flaming red hair, Caruso has virtually no screen presence. Nick Cage would have made a much better Kilmartin.Ving Rhaymes is under-utilized as Junior's gangster customer (and more). He'd have made a compelling Little Junior Brown. Samuel L. Jackson would have been better as the Ving Rhaymes character, and Stanley Tucci(?) and the actor Heald could have improved by switching parts.Helen Hunt (Bev Kilmartin) is killed off early in the movie, as Jimmy's first wife. She'd have been much better as the second wife, who gets to be in the entire movie.Most other casting in KOD is comparably off the mark.The movie is sometimes confusing and complex, yet at the same time draggy and predictable. It all leads to an unsatisfying and anti-climactic ending in which nothing is truly resolved beyond doubt.This is not a totally bad movie, it is just not a very good one. It lacks the grittiness and menace of the original, but adds nothing new to take up the slack except some graphic violence.</fullReview>

Cage plays one bad mother who kills a federal agent (Ving Rhames) in front of Caruso. That's not enough as the feds get put on the ropes by the mob lawyer (Anthony Heald) and the D.A. makes a deal and drops the case. With the help of a cop (Samuel L. Jackson), he closes the deal and goes off with his new wife (Kathryn Erbe).That's the story in a nutshell, but it doesn't do justice to what happens.

		<shortDescription>Lousy remake of a movie that wasn't all that good to begin with</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of the original 1948 "Kiss of Death," but not for the usual reasons. I know it was the film that made Richard Widmark a star, but why I've never been able to figure out. Widmark's performance was a pure cartoon, a Method actor's idea of what a psycho killer is. For my money, the best performance in that picture was Victor Mature's, by far the best performance of his career. Mature's quiet determination and single-mindedness overhsadows Widmark's snarling and glggling, but recognition for his first-rate performance was lost amidt the accolades for Widmark. This film has the same situation. David Caruso, in Mature's part, is quite good; in my opinion, it's the best performance of his career. Samuel L. Jackson is a New York cop who first dogs Caruso, then grows to like him, is also quite good, as is Ving Rhames as a seemingly unbalanced crime lord. Michael Rappaport is excellent as Caruso's weasely, scheming cousin who gets him in all this trouble in the first place. Nicolas Cage does what he does when he doesn't have a strong director--chews up as much scenery as he possibly can. You never really get a sense of danger from Cage's character, although he's shown doing some despicable things. The whole movie has a sterile, by-the-book feel to it. It's as faceless and impersonal as a Michael Bay movie. See if if you're interested in David Caruso; otherwise, forget it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Caruso Fiasco</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why director Barbet Schroder felt it necessary to remake a classic film and then do it so badly is a mystery. David Caruso is awful and the rest of a fine cast wasted in this travesty. The gifted Kathryn Erbe does well in a poorly written role as the woman who stands by Caruso through thick and thin. She is superb but at times the character's devotion seems completely bizarre. Erbe deserved better. Overall, the movie is utterly ridiculous and except for the supporting cast, another David Caruso big screen fiasco. Even with a great director and surrounded by wonderful actors, Caruso just can not carry a motion picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An outstanding ensemble cast propels Kiss of Death. Nicolas Cage is a riot. Caruso, immersing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unjustly overlooked thriller packs a punch. It's a sleek, muscular thriller played by a terrific ensemble cast, as you would expect from a team including director Barbet Schroeder, writer Richard Price, Nicolas Cage,Caruso, and Tucci's marvellously slimy prosecutor. Gutsy dialogue, atmospheric direction, lots of night scenes and an uninhibited take on the source material. A crackling thriller that feels unusually attuned to its lowlife characters. Cage, one of the few American actors who gets more interesting from film to film(well sometimes), comes close to kidnapping the picture as Little Junior, a pumped-up but asthmatic thug who, like King Kong, is a gorilla with a wistful air about him.Cage dominates the camera, stealing scenes by the sheer intensity of his inimitable strangeness.Caruso's acting is vivid, but amazingly quiet and internal, and it's fascinating to watch the kaleidoscopically conflicted emotions battle beneath his controlled surface.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outsized remake that may not be for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This loosely-based remake of a 1947 film noir seems to have few followers, even after 17 years. It made no money in theaters and very few people have commented on it here. TV actor David Caruso plays Jimmy, a small-time criminal who gets sent back to the slammer after taking part in a bungled heist. Worse, his wife is killed in a car accident while he's doing time and his young daughter is sent to live with his hostile mother in law. When he gets out, the state and feds just won't leave him alone. They want him to help them nab Junior, played by a pumped-up, almost unrecognizable Nic Cage. Turns out Junior was the mastermind behind the fumbled heist and numerous other crimes. So Caruso's character goes undercover. The film is violent and foul-mouthed, a far cay from the Victor Mature-Richard-Widmark original. The story has been "opened up," as the 1947 version was largely a soundstage production. It's hard to compare the two, so many changes have been made and liberties taken with the 1995 remake. I watched the two films back to back the other night. Both have their merits. Caruso's Jimmy is a lot more spunky than Mature's hero, and Cage's over the top villain is worlds apart from Widmark's sneering, oily bad guy. Cage portrays Junior (called Tommy Udo in the 1947 version) as an over-sized psychopath with some very odd ticks and habits, and he is truly demented and scary. By comparison, Widmark's Udo is almost comical, a Damon Runyonesque gangster who would fit right in in a production of "Guys and Dolls." Plus the remake boasts a stellar supporting cast, including Helen Hunt as Jimmy's ill-fated wife, Stanley Tucci as a two-faced prosecutor, Michael Rappaport as Jimmy's larcenous cousin, Kathryn "Criminal Intent" Erbe as Jimmy's loyal friend and Sam Jackson as a detective who has a bone to pick with Jimmy. See both films. It couldn't hurt.</fullReview>

I say pick this up and you will be entertained if you like any of the actors in the movie. Everyone clicks and there is no boring parts throughout. Trust me, Caruso shines as always.</fullReview>

The movie deals with a ex-con played by David Caruso(Jade) and his life after he go to jail for a crime he was involved with. Nicholas Cage(City of Angels,8 MM) stars a little Junior Brown(a very crazy crime boss) who Caruso must befriend and later betray. This movie also features Samual L. Jackson(Deep Blue Sea), Helen HUnt(Twister,As Good As It Gets), Micheal Rappaport(Deep Blue Sea), Stanley Tucci (The Imposters) co-star in new street smart stylish thriller of a movie made over 40 years ago!!The premise is still the same , just the story has been updated for the 1990's!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this film in the theatre in spring of 1995, I was so impressed that I remarked that I would be surprised if I saw a better film the rest of the year. I do not remember seeing a better one.David Caruso plays the part of Jimmy Kilmartin, a recently paroled petty crook who is attempting to set his life straight again, complete with wife and daughter. One fateful night, his cousin (?), played by Michael Rappaport, convinces Jimmy to go in on one last transfer in order to save Ronnie's hide. Reluctantly, Jimmy agrees and is subsequently arrested, leading to a nightmarish journey which finds him in the clutches of both a vengeful cop, played brilliantly by Samuel Jackson, and a gangster who ultimately inherits his father's throne at the head of a criminal organization.Caruso plays the part of Kilmartin beautifully, utilizing his range to elicit both pity from the audience as well as the perception of a tough guy who is too smart to give in to either side.Jackson, as always, is brilliant. I don't think there is an actor in Hollywood who gives more consistently powerful performances, save for maybe the great Kevin Spacey. This guy is LONG overdue for an Oscar.Other fine performances are given by the aforementioned Rappaport, as well as Helen Hunt, Stanley Tucci, and Nicolas Cage, in one of the finest performances of his career. His character, "Little Junior", is both terrifying and darkly comical at once. Not an easy feat to pull off.Rent this film. It is a wonderful remake of a noir classic and it deserves much more credit than that which it has received.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. It was exciting. It had Nicholas Cage in it. The mob was in it. Car chopping, Thugs killing each other. That red haired guy from CSI Miami - Nicholas Cage owned a strip club and liked to beat people up- I loved it.Thanks. Samuel Jackson was in it. What else..... Hell, I wish I could of been in it. I could of at least played a stripper. Nicholas Cage was buffed out. He was a bad ass. I loved it. He is so hot. I liked when they beat that guy up in the garage because the guy was supposed to give the girl a ride home but did'nt . She woke up and tried to steal the guy's car but got killed trying to escape. So, They went to the guy's garage and took him out.That's what I'm talking about.... Yeah.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just finished watching this and although I saw it edited on local cable, I can't imagine the unedited version being much better. As others have noted, Cage was unconvincing as "Little Junior" - a mob boss prodigy who takes over the reins upon the demise of his ailing father. NYPD blue stardom aside for Caruso, Helen Hunt's minor role, Jackson giving a so-so performance at best, this movie left a lot to be desired. Fairly standard fair with the old crime operation goes bad, one of the perps gets turned by the cops, rats a few people out, goes undercover, seeks retribution and so on and so forth. If nothing better is on and you have seen all your own movies too many times, give this a try. But don't get your hopes up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie, with lots of interesting (some over the top) performances from David Caruso, Samuel L. Jackson, Nicholas Cage, Ving Rhames, Stan Tucci, but especially Helen Hunt. What also stands out is the realistic mix of both black and white small-time criminals in a blue collar neighborhood.This being a movie about small-time criminals, the movie is excessively moralistic (the main character can't seem to have any luck at all), however, these Hollywood mores are handled in a professional manner so you almost don't notice when you get into the story.The title is very much throw-away (no deadly kissed that I could discern), which I don't understand because this is still a very good movie. Very much underrated and under-publicized.See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kathryn Erbe Is Superb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with any role she assays, Kathryn Erbe creates a character of such depth and meaning that she deservedly receives most of the attention of audiences. Here, she takes an underwritten part and through her compassion, spirituality, and sensuality makes the film her own. Anyone who has watched her on Law and Order: Criminal Intent, OZ, Homicide: Life On the Street on television, or seen the films Dream With the Fishes, 3 Backyards, or especially and most notably Blume In Love, realizes Ms. Erbe is an actor's actor. She is certainly one of the most gifted women working as an actor in any medium. Over the course of Criminal Intent, she was able to keep the character of Eames fresh and real while holding her own with grace as her co-star did everything possible to overshadow her. There was, however, no ignoring Ms. Erbe's presence. The film now being discussed is a weak remake and not very good, simply put. Yet Kathryn Erbe makes her part shine and with a subtle power makes her character outstanding. She deserves an opportunity in better quality films to demonstrate how gifted and talented she is. She has done this time after time on stage and whether in film or on television, audiences are always in for something very special when her name appears in the credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why was this film made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film does not feature _any_ new elements, not anything we haven't seen before in other films. It's totally redundant. It even has a negative effect - because could someone please tell me why Cage, S.L. Jackson, and even Helen Hunt signed up for this? Were they in need of some money? I seriously doubt it, but I cannot think of any other reason.I know it's the script, but the role Cage plays is disgusting. And my estimation of him used to be quite high, actually. For example, I loved him as a good person in "It could happen to you", and in "Face/Off". The latter also proved that a "good guy" character suits him much better than a "bad guy" character. Anyway, even good-old S.L. couldn't save this one.Rating from the Dutch judge: 5 (out of 10).</fullReview>

Not only is the story amazing, that goes without saying, but it's the little subtleties that really make the difference; the directing in terms of the mise en scene present in divine, the lighting throughout is spectacular. All and all the The Kiss of Death is a great film, containing great acting, particularly by Nicolas Cage. Speaking of thrillers and Nic Cage he's got a new one coming out called Trespass that looks pretty cool. Check out the trailer then thank me for changing your life. http://bitly.com/qN22Cm</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coincidence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wonder if the makers of Intolerable Cruelty took the idea for the hit man firing his inhaler at George Clooney from Cage's terrible over-the-top performance. Or to use another analogy, he was Darth Vader without a mask. There is a good movie in there somewhere with a little pruning: Cage morphed into the cackling Widmark and the elimination of the back story of the Assistant DA's ambition to be a judge among others. I have the impression that was included so we could see Samuel L Jackson give a nod to Caruso as the latter drove off in his SUV. One little gem: the beaming man in the club who picks up the gun and hands it to Caruso, like he is looking for a good citizen award.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this movie in the TV program, my look directly went to famous names in the role list like Helen Hunt and Nicolas Cage. They'r (normally) very talented actors and I almost looked forward to watch this. But what a disappointment when the movie began! Hunt was removed after just a short while and without her,this went really downwards. Cage is normally good but he plays such a crazy,psychotic villain in this that he feels unnatural. He feels exaggerated and I just get mad when watching Cages seriously liable character. Also there is a boring, cold atmosphere in this movie,it has no warmth or love in it. Next time the makers of this film could use the talented actors to something better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicolas Cage , Helen Hunt and Samuel L Jackson in a film from the 1990s ! Must be good I thought . Well actually KISS OF DEATH is not all that good ,it`s by no means bad it`s just that the three afore mentioned stars were well known at the time but weren`t stars yet . The film was made around the same time as David Caruso was trying to break into films and is really a star vehicle for him . Helen Hunt is fairly effective for the short screentime she gets , Samuel L Jackson is just okay but Nicolas Cage is far too over the top to be taken seriously and will never make a convincing screen villain which is why you`ll never see him play a baddy these days . As for Caruso ...well can anyone name anything he`s been in apart from NYPD BLUES or JADE ? Bottom line is KISS OF DEATH is a mediocre remake let down mainly by its star and a very weak script</fullReview>
