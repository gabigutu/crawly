		<shortDescription>Robin Williams should really stick to more serious roles like this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was completely stunned at how well Robin Williams pulled off more serious dramatic roles, since he's much more well-known for high-energy comedy. But his roles as the bad guy in movies like Insomnia or, even better, One Hour Photo display the extent of his acting abilities, since he is able to pull off such different characters so well. In Jakob the Liar, his comedic talents are restricted just enough so that he is able to function properly within the atmosphere of the movie, but is still allowed a scene or two in which his ability to get laughs can come out. He plays Jakob, a Jewish shopkeeper in a Nazi ghetto who tells a friend that he has a radio in order to prevent that friend from committing suicide.Things do not appear to be going well within the ghetto, the war seems like it will never end, and morale among the imprisoned Jews is steadily waning, resulting in suicides left and right. As Jakob finds a friend of his doing something that will certainly get him killed by the Nazis (this particular friend decided to make a ham-handed attempt at escape rather than overtly kill himself), Jakob runs to him and tells him that he heard on the radio that the Russians were closing in and would liberate them any day. His skeptical friend doubts him, so Jakob quickly tells him that he has a radio so that he will believe the Russians will be there to save them all soon, and his friend's suicide is prevented.By the next morning, literally everyone in the ghetto knows that Jakob Heym has a radio, and so he is venerated like a God and constantly hounded about what the newest news is, and thus enters the main conflict of the movie. And speaking of which, one of the things that I really liked about the movie was the complexity of its conflict. It's a conflict that you sit there knowing what needs to happen for a happy ending and so you sit there and hope for that, because every option has terrible consequences.Jakob, first and foremost, is absolutely terrified that word will reach the Nazis who will execute him if they discover he has a radio (whether he really has it or not), yet at the same time he can't let it get out within the ghetto that he DOESN'T have a radio, because since the whole rumor began the rampant suicides have completely ceased. What he has to do, then, is walk the fine line between delivering lots of fictitious good news to the whole ghetto without letting the Nazis find out about it.There is definitely something that needs to be said about the importance of a movie like this. Obviously, holocaust movies are nothing new, and different depictions of the holocaust have been especially in the spotlight since Roberto Benigni made a holocaust movie called Life Is Beautiful in 1997, at least half of which was a comedy. A lot of people felt that it was distasteful to present something as serious and tragic as the holocaust in such a light. And not just average moviegoers like me, either. Spielberg thought it was too lighthearted for such weighty subject matter, and from a certain point of view, he's right. On the other hand, however, the fact that you laughed during the film does not change the meaning of the war that it focuses on. The Nazis killed funny people, too.I read a review on the title page for Jakob the Liar here on the IMDb, where a reviewer who completely missed the boat on this movie criticized it for things like the comedic content, the behavior and presentation of the Jews of the ghetto, and the choice of Robin Williams for the role of Jakob Heym. To be perfectly honest, I can never understand people like that. The way I see it, as long as a movie takes the holocaust seriously then it should not be criticized for being a holocaust film that's not in the right format or that had an actor who has done too many comedy roles. This same reviewer, by the way, praised Life Is Beautiful, a spectacular film, as is Jakob the Liar.I can certainly understand that there are people who are touchy about the holocaust. It is inarguably one of the most tragic events in all of recorded human history, made even more tragic by the fact that it was perpetrated by humans against other humans. It's sickening. But there are no jokes about the holocaust in Jakob the Liar. The Jews do not act like victims. It is historically accurate and does not compromise the truth of what happened for the sake of entertainment. It presents a story of a ghetto full of captive Jews who have had their lives stolen from them and are desperate for some hope, and one man tries to help and inadvertently finds himself in a position to provide massive amounts of hope to them, but at massive risk to his own safety.So if you don't like to see Robin Williams playing serious, dramatic roles (roles at which he is increasingly displaying his massive talent ), don't watch the movie! It is neither a secret that Williams is in the movie, nor that it's a serious role. One look at the cover box will tell you that. But if it's the holocaust being taken seriously that troubles you, maybe you should be more concerned about the fact that there are people, alive TODAY, here in the 21st Century, and presumably relatively educated American citizens, who DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE HOLOCAUST EVER EVEN HAPPENED. So like I said, if you're that concerned about the portrayal of the holocaust, maybe focus your efforts on these nutcases who have convinced themselves that the holocaust itself is just a fable. Maybe a myth that mothers started telling their kids to make them scared of Germans or some other such nonsense.Jakob the Liar has no illusions, it takes a tragedy in human history and tells a story of a man who did what he could to help those suffering around him, and Robin Williams should obviously be commended for the power of his performance, as should the rest of the cast. The thing to keep in mind is that there is no certain perspective from which to view things like the holocaust. Everyone has different thoughts and feelings about it, and in the movies these different perspectives can be provided in different ways without compromising the severity and finality of the event itself. Jakob the Liar does not at all trivialize the holocaust in any way, what it does is honor the loss of its victims, who came from all walks of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Testifying To The Power Of Hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years, I have found Robin Williams to be one of the most frustrating actors around. Clearly loaded with talent, in my opinion at least most of his movies have been disappointments. He either gives unnecessarily over-the-top performances that really don't fit the context, or he controls his natural comedic instincts to the point at which he comes across as uninspired. So I wasn't sure what to expect in "Jakob the Liar." What I found was a surprisingly good performance in a wonderful movie.Williams plays Jakob Heym, confined to the Jewish Ghetto of Warsaw by the Nazis during the Second World War. With hope fading, Heym accidentally discovers that Russian troops aren't far away, and begins to spread the news. Others become convinced that he has a radio hidden, and Heym's fictional "news reports" from the BBC provide enough hope to keep the residents of the Ghetto going through this dark time.Williams (also executive producer) did a fine job as Heym. As one would expect, his character comes across as something of a comedian ("I believe we're God's Chosen People; I just wish He had chosen someone else!") but his humour is appropriate; the sort of dark humour one would expect from people in this situation. The other performances faded into the background, not because they were bad but because Williams so dominated the movie. Special mention should go to Justus von Dohnanyi, though, who played the Nazi Commandant "Preuss." Dohnanyi manages to capture exactly the sort of slimy, inhuman character one would expect to be put in charge of such a business. The rest of the cast (primarily Hannah Taylor-Gordon as Lina and Liev Schreiber as Mischa) are good, but overshadowed by Williams.The character of Kirschbaum (played by Armin Mueller-Stahl) filled me with sadness and represents a clear statement of the evils of Nazism. A world-famous cardiologist, Kirschbaum, because he is Jewish, is forbidden to practice medicine, and ends up cleaning toilets. Mueller-Stahl plays the character with a quiet dignity, and next to Williams is the clear highlight of the movie.This movie represents a wonderful testimony to the importance of hope in helping people see themselves through what must seem to be impossible situations. Although fictional, it is an important movie for those with an interest in the events of this era.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the reviews and was a little hesitant to go see this movie. Not very good reviews. But after seeing the movie, I can't understand why the critics didn't like it. Guess they want Robin Williams to stay in his mold as a comedian. I've seen him in his recent serious roles, and I think he is an excellent drama actor. I think he has come a long way since Mork and Mindy. This movie was very good. It is a movie about the holocaust in Poland. It takes place in the ghetto and tells of a used to be restaurant owner who here's some propaganda on the radio (in the gestapos office) and ends up telling lies to boost his fellow mans moral. I don't want to go into detail to much cuz it would spoil the movie for you. Also, he meets a little girl who escaped from a train to the camps and befriends Jakob who takes her in and takes care of her. They have a very cute relationship. All in all I thought this movie was very well done and portrayed the holocaust in a very realistic way. The cast was very good..........you must go see this movie!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are interested in the holocaust, and want to be entertained at the same time, Jakob the Liar is your film. This is not intended to be an historical film. And, to be sure, it isn't. Just speaking for myself, I wish everyone would educate themselves about this horrible episode in human history. If you have a friend who refuses to watch honest historical films, turn them on to Jakob the Liar. It IS Robin Williams, after all. For sure, this film will encourage them to learn more about the holocaust. Its very entertaining and does give some superficial insight into what the atrocity was all about.Robin Williams did his best. He did a fine job in this film, and deserves even more credit just for making the attempt. On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it an 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe the reason I keep hearing so many negative comments on this film is because people aren't seeing it for what it is. It is not a comedy by any stretch of the imagination. It is not an attempt to profit from LA VITA E BELLA (this was filmed in the autumn of '97, before the Benigni film was even released in Italy).The truth is, JAKOB THE LIAR is an incredible film in its own right. I've read/seen many other Holocaust testimonials (including MAUS and the aforementioned LA VITA E BELLA), but this was by far the most stirring of any of them. I was especially impressed by Robin Williams' performance. Granted, I'm partial to him, but I was completely bowled over by this performance. I believe this is the darkest and most serious role he has ever done, but he pulls it off magnificently.Don't believe the nay-sayers on this one ... this is incredible. It's a must-see for everyone. Would I lie to you?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark comedy, with an appropriately surreal ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I like about Jakob's tale is that Jakob is no natural hero who sets out to keep hope alive. Far from it. He is an ordinary man, and as terrified of the Nazis as any of his neighbors in the ghetto. He blunders his way into his unlikely role as a keeper of hope, and once there, cannot see from moment to moment how he can maintain it, wishes at times he could be rid of the burden, and yet somehow, manages to continue to inspire others who are so desperate for hope, they don't even try to disbelieve. In short, don't be fooled by the title: Jakob is just this guy; plotwise, he is only a hub around which a large wheel turns. There were parts that didn't work for me, especially pieces where narration would have worked better than a character monologue (Jakob is a narrator as well as a character, so why does he talk to himself instead of us so much?) But on the whole, it was a good story, well performed by those involved.The ending, which I shall refrain from describing for the benefit of any who have not seen it, is absolutely fitting. It is surreal, which may bother some, but leaves the door open to so many interpretations that you will wonder whether to take it as the true end, or whether it was Jakob's final lie. And fittingly, the decision is left in the mind of the viewer. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>NO SPOILERS, read freely. I had long heard about this movie but I did not have a slight clue of how good it really was. Apart Michael Jeter, Alan Arkin, Robin Williams and Armin Mueller-Stahl I wasn't really familiar with many other faces on the screen but everyone stood up to their role brilliantly. This WWII drama narrates the story of accidental prophet Jakob whose lies bring hope to those living in his Ghetto in a time of hardship. It's a sad story but more than once you are forced to smile by the evvents. Missing out on this one would be a pity. Everything about JAKOB THE LIAR is perfect, it's a very realistic down to earth story, acting and script are also brilliant...not to mention Edward Shearmur's really heartwarming scoundtrack, what a pity it has not been released. (the CD) A must for the lovers of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another solid performance by Robin Williams!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't be put off by the negative comments. If you like the characters Robin Williams creates, and you like unusual dramas, you'll like Jakob the Liar. The film wanted to be Roberto Benigni and Life is Beautiful but never seemed to have the courage to go there, even with Robin Williams in the lead, until the last few scenes of the movie. However, being another Life is Beautiful is asking an awful lot. Life is Beautiful is one of the great films of all time. Having said that, Jakob the Liar is fiendishly good, creatively done, and Robin Williams does a fine job, even when Hannah Taylor-Gordon, who plays Lina, wasn't stealing every scene she was in. So, settle down and give this little movie a try. If nothing else, it's another solid performance by Robin Williams.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the most underrated movie of the last five years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always a shame to see movies that we feel bring so much to the table, be given bad reviews or do poorly at the box-office. While people who say the "holocaust film" has become a trite and overdone genre may be correct, this film is an outstanding piece of work that suffered mainly because it was released around the same time as the fairly similar "Life is Beautiful." with Roberto Benini. The story follows a jewish man named Jakob, who had been forced into a ghetto by the nazis. (hollywood's favorite villians by far) After overhearing a radio transmission, he relays the information to his companions that the russians are coming closer to liberating the ghetto. His friends misunderstand this, and believe that he himself has a radio, and press him for more at every turn. He is forced to make up news, in order to give his fellow prisoners hope. This film is not only about one man bringing hope to people who otherwise have none. It is about the sacrifices that some people are willing to make, in order to keep that hope alive. The jewish doctor in this film was actually in the original movie (made in germany in the mid 70's) The sacrifice the doctor makes is very moving, and gives a clear cut message of the film. At the time, many critics disliked this film. If they had a chance to review it again however, I think that they would most likely change their perspective. Nine out of Ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jakob tries to give us hope by making up the happy ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First thing...People who say the ending is too sentimental and sappy don't understand! Sadly, it's not happy like many believe. In Jakob's final narration, he was trying to instill hope in the viewers just like he did with his people when he falsely said he had the radio. This is evident when he says, "Or MAYBE..." He made many of the hopeful things up throughout the movie, so that's why I think he made up the happy ending. Now to the review...A very good movie. It seems overlong at times, but the wonderful performance of Robin Williams as Jakob held my interest very much. This is a dreary, depressing film, and hardly has any humor. The type of humor found in this movie is extremely dry, and isn't for everyone (I know it isn't my type). As for the cinematography, well, it was wonderful. There's not much color in this film, only drab and soft brown, black and gray tones, which add to the atmosphere of sadness. Overall, a very effective film. Rating: 7.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a great mix of history and humour, which Robin Williams delivers brilliantly. Set in late 1944, it tells the story of a Jew living in his hometown that the Germans have taken control of. When he is sent to a German officer's office for being out after curfew he hears a report that the Russians are heading in his towns direction and thinks they may free him and his town from the Germans. The next day he tells his friend what he heard, in confidence, but doesn&amp;#8217;t believe Jakob heard it on a German radio and believes Jakob has his own radio (Jew's were forbidden to own or listen to radio's, and rarely return from German office's,). Once the rumour spreads that the Russian's are coming and that Jakob has a radio, the town keeps asking for more Information. Jakob has to make up information since no one believes he doesn&amp;#8217;t have a radio and the information brings the Jew's hope. Meanwhile Jakob has taken in a little Jewish girl who has escaped form a train heading to the gas "showers" and must also keep hidden from the Germans. Just a great story of Jewish life in the war without to much war violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The great thing about this movie is how honest it is. Even though some of the things you see may be a bit graphic, the movie dosen't hold back. The tag line "when there was no hope, he invented it" is very fitting for this movie. Doing the same type of thing he did as Adrian Chronhour in Good Morning Vietnam, Robin Williams shines. Personally, I think it is best performance yet. It was such an impacting movie. When Jacob(Robin Williams) does that first "Radio broadcast", you feel yourself laugh along with the little girl whom he befriends. I really liked this movie.(in case you didn't figure that out) The performances were very solid, the heartfelt moments were touching and the direction was solid. It was a visually engrossing movie. It makes you laugh, cry and at the end feel good about your life. If it's Friday night and you want a drama, take this one home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engrossing tale of hope kept alive in a wartime Jewish ghetto</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, I found very touching &amp; heart wrenching this story of one man's efforts to lift spirits in a World War II Jewish ghetto in Poland. Many have compared it to Life is Beautiful, and there are some similarities. I can understand why some viewers take offense at any film which might seem to trivialize the Holocaust, but I found Life is Beautiful not disrespectful but deeply moving, and consider this particular tale to be a captivating depiction of one individual's unique attempt to keep hope alive in a desperate situation.The story revolves around a lonely Polish shopkeeper &amp; widower, Jakob, who is confined to a Jewish ghetto in 1944. When summoned to ghetto headquarters for being out after curfew, he hears a radio report about Russian troop movements. To prevent a friend's suicide, he claims to have heard on his radio that the Russians are very close (within a few hundred kilometers) and will liberate the ghetto soon, causing rumours that Jakob has a secret radio. Instead of telling the truth, he tries to lift spirits and impart hope to the war weary &amp; depressed ghetto inhabitants by maintaining the fiction of possessing this radio, and regularly disseminating uplifting fictional news bulletins about the Allies' progress. Meanwhile, Jakob is also hiding a young Jewish girl who escaped from a camp transport. The Germans hear reports of this forbidden radio and are seeking out the resistance operator of it.Robin Williams dominates this movie and is brilliant as usual in the endearing, sympathetic role of the kind Jakob who must try to balance getting out lots of hopeful (if fictitious) war reports to keep spirits up while at the same time avoid Nazi suspicion and detection.The movie portrays the despair of the ghetto's inhabitants and the grave injustice of their captive state. For example, Jewish people are prohibited from practicing medicine and a cardiologist is reduced to cleaning toilets, though does so with good humour, grace, and dignity. On the whole it is a very poignant tale, with any humour having a sad note to it. Jakob the Liar shows another tragic aspect of the Holocaust. Rather than the horrors of the concentration camps that are often the setting of such stories, here we see the injustice and despair of prolonged ghetto captivity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story poorly told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of the 1974 film by the same name draws obvious comparisons to `Life is Beautiful', but it is a poor substitute in every regard. This film sometimes tries to be `Hogan's Hero's' in its farcical sendup of German captivity and at other times it tries to be `Schindler's List' with disturbing portrayals of the inhumanity of the holocaust. Unlike `Life is Beautiful' which was a bittersweet story lovingly done, this story is merely distasteful and makes a mockery of the plight of the Jews in captivity during WWII. It portrays the citizens of the ghetto as bumbling idiots with little regard for the gravity of their situation. A holocaust story is no place for Keystone Cops comedy skits.Director Peter Kassovitz gives us nothing distinctive from a visual standpoint, nor does he bring forth the proper tone and mood from the actors. The acting is uniformly mediocre. Alan Arkin has given us numerous excellent performances, but his character was so insubstantial and inane, it was difficult for him not to look foolish. Liev Schreiber, as Mischa, made the character into a complete buffoon (perhaps that is what Kassovitz intended). Finally, Robin Williams needs to seek career counseling. He keeps taking these poignant comedic roles that are just not right for his talents. He needs to realize his limitations and embrace his genius. He is incomparable in frenetic, over the edge comedic roles that require quick witted ad libs and shock comedy. As a serious actor he is simply unexceptional and his attempts at such are especially disappointing when compared against his true ability.I rated this film a 4/10. If it was a holocaust story that needed to be told, it certainly needed to be told differently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robin Williams plays a storekeeper and 'part-time Jew' in 1944 Poland who invents uplifting radio announcements to get his bedraggled comrades through tough times during the Nazi regime; soon, though, his friends want to see the radio and hear the broadcasts for themselves. From Jurek Becker's novel, previously filmed in Germany in 1975, but lacking style and emotional punch. The wayward Jewish accents are almost cartoonish in their over-exaggeration, and casting Williams as Jakob was a gambit that just doesn't work (his performance plays like a medley of the actor's other serious turns on film). Although a big-budget production, the picture has a constricted, set-bound feel, and offers viewers little but maudlin sentiments and cheap lines of self-deprecating humor. Apparently heartfelt intentions can't keep this from misfiring. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please Don't Let This Film Be Forgotten...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. Jakob the Liar. Where to being with this movie? I mean, it's pretty under the radar as far as WWII movies about Jews in the ghetto go. I hate to say it, but that whole concept is frankly getting a little boring. Add in some generic scores from multiple review sites, and this movie seems doomed to be forgotten. Jakob the Liar tells the story of (wait for it?) Jakob Hyem. The movie begins with Jakob (played by Robin Williams in one of his surprisingly many serious roles) narrating a joke to the audience. "Hitler goes to a fortune-teller and asks, 'When will I die?' And the fortune-teller replies, 'On a Jewish holiday.' Hitler then asks, 'How do you know that?' And she replies, 'Any day you die will be a Jewish holiday.'" This basically sets up the entire tone of the movie. It's a film about finding hope through humor in a pretty terrible situation. This isn't a new concept, but it knows that from beginning to end (ESPECIALLY at the end, but I'll get to that later). Anyway, fast-forward a bit, and Jakob finds himself awaiting punishment for a pretty harmless crime in the office of a German soldier. While he awaits the officer's actual arrival, he manages to overhear a radio telling of Russia's arrival into Germany. So Jakob goes on with his life until he one day stops one of his fellow workers from doing something drastic by telling him of the news he heard on the radio. The worker, taking this out of context, assumes Jakob has a secret forbidden radio in his home. Despite Jakob's explanations denouncing this idea, the man simply assumes this is all a front so as not to get in trouble with the Gestapo. The news of Jakob's radio, of course, spreads quickly throughout the entire ghetto. Suddenly, Jakob has many new friends. He continues to deny owning a radio out of fear for his life but quickly realizes the actual hope it brings to these people. So, he inevitably continues the lie by making up new stories on a regular basis of the Russian front which his coworkers eat up like candy. Let me just say this about his coworkers. I don't know why, but I absolutely fell in love with these people. Maybe it was the surprisingly stellar performances from a movie that I thought would just be mediocre. Maybe it was the Mountain Dew I just happened to chug right as I started watching this. Either way, this was one of those movies that makes you go, "Oh hey! It's THAT guy! Hold on. Pause the movie for a sec. I gotta go look up who these guys are and what else they've been in, or I won't be able to focus." So in this cavalcade, we've got Liev "Sabretooth from X-Men" Schreiber, Mark "Tio from television's Breaking Bad" Margolis, Bob "Captain Orr from Catch-22" Balaban, Michael "Mr. Noodle from Sesame Street" Jeter, and the always amazing Alan "Too Many Characters to List" Arkin. This was, hands down, one of my favorite casts to follow throughout a film. Each actor took their character's unique traits in stride, making for some great back-and-forth dialogue. You can tell they each truly enjoyed their characters, leading to, dare I say it, some of the best performances in all of their careers. "But Hawkeye, why should I care about pretty good acting in a movie about the Holocaust when I can just go watch Schindler's List?" Well, eager reader, I'm actually glad you brought that film up. Here, have a cookie. Honestly, I don't think this movie wants to be associated with Schindler's List or any of that film's wannabes. For instance, this film has Robin Williams as its titular character. That right there should show you how much this movie wants to be associated as something different. This was a film that dared to say, "Hey. Let's tone down the over-the-top empathy for once, shall we?" I think this is both where the film excelled and doomed itself. You see, normally movies like this end with a big tear-worthy speech from the hero. Instead?well, I don't want to spoil anything, but here are Robin William's words basically spelling out the reality of trying to live each day as a Jew during the Holocaust: "So that's how it ended. I never got a chance to be the big hero and make my big speech. I swear, I had a speech all prepared about freedom and never giving in. But somehow... Yes, that's how it ended. They all went off to the camps and were never seen again. But maybe it wasn't like that at all." In a way, it all sort of reminded me of the film Waltz With Bashir. Like Bashir's Ari Folman, Jakob is more of an observer than an actual hero per se. He wants and tries to be a hero, but he has a certain sense of reality I absolutely fell in love with that Robin Williams truly brings to life. In fact, I think I'm going to have to say this was Robin Williams best serious acting role. It definitely was my favorite. If for some reason none of this has caught your fancy, at least watch Jakob the Liar for what I believe to be one of the most memorable monologues I've heard in a long time. We find Jakob alone in front of his pancake shop contemplating the mess he's just gotten himself into with the radio. Solemnly, he takes a seat and stares at the ground before beginning to talk aloud to no one in particular. "Yeah, it is crazy. I know. But when I started to make up those things...I almost believed them. I know. The point is, what am I going to invent tomorrow? In my whole life, my greatest invention was an apricot pancake. A latke. My crowning achievement: Latkes and lies."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie about hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jakob the Liar is an underrated movie.I just want to say that before anything else in my review.The movie tells about Jakob Heym, excellently played by Robin Williams.Jakob is a Jewish shop keeper living in Polish ghetto in 1944.He overhears a German radio broadcast about Russian troop movements.When he shares the information with a friend a rumor about a secret radio starts spreading in the ghetto.Jakob starts making up stories to the ghetto inhabitants he has heard from his 'secret radio'.This way he brings hope to the people who are losing it.Peter Kassovitz' Jakob the Liar (1999) hasn't got as much credit it would have deserved.It's a movie about an important matter.It combines comedy and tragedy in a great way.It has a brilliant cast.Robin Williams is just amazing.This actor, who turns 55 today (congratulations) has a great ability to act both comic and dramatic roles.He is a great man and a great actor.The young Hannah Taylor- Gordon is excellent playing Lina Kronstein, the Jewish girl Jakob is hiding.She was amazing also playing Anne Frank a couple years later.I hope we'll be hearing a lot from her in the future.Then there are also these greats; Bob Balaban (Kowalsky), Alan Arkin (Max Frankfurter), Michael Jeter (Avron), Liev Schreiber (Mischa the Prizefighter), director's son Mathieu Kassovitz (Herchel) and lots of others.This is a movie that can make you laugh and it is a movie that can make you cry.It shows all these poor people living under the horrors of war, under the circumstances you can not justify. Horrible things happened back then and now there are movies to show us it all.This is a movie about hope.Hope is still there in the dramatic ending.Hope is seen through the tears.Isn't that, hope, all we need in the end?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy in the Ghetto? Oy Vey!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: May Contain Spoilers.What's next for Robin Williams? How about, "Throttle Up," in which Williams plays a slapstick NASA engineer on the day that shuttle Challenger blows up? Doesn't sound like a good idea, does it?Well neither does "Jakob the Liar."This tale may have made it if it were approached in the same vein as Bill Murray's, "The Razor's Edge." In that film, we saw a comedic giant act in a purely dramatic role. While no box office success, it was a good film.The problem with, "Jakob" is that drama is often sacrificed for really senseless and unfunny comedy. These scenes are accompanied by stereotypical music that reminds the audience the ghetto community is jewish. DUH! To make matters worse, several of the American cast members, drift in and out of ridiculous accents.Unfortunately it doesn't end here. One of the characters in the ghetto happens upon a pistol. One would think the film would triumph his incredible luck. Oh no, the politically correct crowd who makes movies these days, had to impose nineties' anti gun fervor on the ghetto victims of the forties. It seems if you ever needed a gun, it just might be at the moment you are about to be hauled off to a death camp in a cattle car!In sum, "Jakob the Liar" is a film made in incredibly poor taste. There were some good parts, but I refuse to discuss them.</fullReview>

They just changed the most powerful scene from the 1975 original by Frank Beyer.SPOILER ahead When Lina discovers that Jakob has no radio at all, she prolongs his lie, so that he can still believe in it too. In this disgraceful remake, she goes to him and dances with him. They just don't get the message of the book by Jurek Becker.I can't understand this. So leave this one alone and watch "Jakob der Lügner", by the way the only movie from the former GDR ever to be nominated for an Oscar as best foreign language film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well in my 9th grade history class in school we are learning about WW2 and so we watched Jakob the Liar and I think it was great, Robin Williams does good in the movie. I think they did the movie real well and really do good at showing how it was back in the 1940's during the war and how the Jews were treated. And i like how hey put some comedy into it also but not to much. When watching the movie i was very entertained the whole time. And the whole time you are left in suspense trying to figure out what is going next and what is going to happen to the main character Jakob with all the lying he does if either he was going to get caught or get away with it. And also how long he was going to go with the lie of him having a radio.And i just recommend this movie to teens or teachers who are looking for a good World War 2 movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depressing. There is No Lying About That.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jakob the Liar (1999): Dir: Peter Kossovitz / Cast: Robin Williams, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Bob Balaban, Liev Schreiber, Hannah Taylor- Gordon: Robin Williams plays Jakob who stares everyday at the wall lined with barbwire. It is 1944 and Germans have captured his Polish village. Central plot regards how he gave hope to people by lying. They believe that he owns a radio when in fact he does not. Fine setup marred by useless subplots including one of a young girl. Others may argue whether or not the ending is appropriate or just plain contrived. Director Peter Kossovitz brings insight into the material although the use of humour is distracting. William seems to be playing his usual form of comic overplay where the film plays off sincerity within contrivance. Armin Mueller-Stahl plays the brave and wise doctor. Bob Balaban plays a barber and Liev Schreiber plays a boxer. With the exception of Schreiber these roles are mere cardboard and contain about as much life as a barbwire fence. Schreiber as the boxer at least carries on the rumors believing them as fact while pursuing the hand of a young woman. Had these characters not been presented with extreme comic overtones then perhaps we could get behind them. The film is technically well made but does not involve us as perhaps it should. It presents a strong message of hope within a film that is simply hopeless. Score: 5 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Never really tell what it was Going for,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jakob the Liar is a brutal movie with a poorly written storyline and a good cast that sadly weren't enough at all to make this worthwhile. The biggest issue with the movie is that it never really knows what genre it wants to be, there are intense and dramatic war scenes, and then straight after there could be a very comedic scene, this is a huge problem as because of the comedic scenes, you couldn't take the dramatic scenes seriously and because of the dramatic scenes, you couldn't laugh at the comedy. I'm a huge fan of Robin Williams but even he couldn't make this enjoyable for me, I didn't find Jakob to be a likable character and didn't care for him, as for the rest of the cast, there was a complete lack of chemistry and none of them put enough effort in to their performances. Tries to be both funny and dramatic and mostly fails at both, I wouldn't recommend Jakob the Liar to anyone. A prisoner in a ghetto in wartime Poland decides to invent optimistic news to cheer up his fellow prisoners.Best Performance: Robin Williams Worst Performance: Hannah Taylor Gordon</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>532nd Review: Comedy &amp; The Holocaust: In the long tradition of Jewish humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jakob the Liar features a good straight-up performance by Robin Williams and a terrific supporting cast, but more than that it is a surprisingly complex film that reflects many of the classic traits of Yiddish humor. In Yiddish humor, the shtetl, or classic village, as immortalized in the wonderful stories of Sholomon Aleichem (think Fiddler on the Roof and Tevya, which is a direct adaptation from Aleichem's tales) are full of set characters - and they are here - the Professor is like the Rebbe, Jakob is a schnorre (someone who loves to get things for free) who becomes the mensch (the upstanding man), and so on.Of all the films in the Holocaust corpus this is one of the few that reflects with fantasy and imagination and humor what suffering means in Jewish culture. One can argue that films about the Holocaust necessarily are depressing (or must have that Hollywood lift of hope - why?! - there was no hope) - but here there is a genuine attempt to speak into the culture of Ghetto Judaism and refer back to Aleichem's wonderful mix of family, suffering, and laughter.The film is not wholly successful - the humour is wry, but it never quite gets to the sorrow in it, and replaces that with genuine sorrow. However it defies our norms of this style of film and as such, very correctly, challenges our notions and images of daily life outside the camps.All in all this rewards viewing at a deeper level than simply a man who invents a radio to give others hope - it is a real reflection of pre-war Judaic humor and as such is a very worthwhile attempt to preserve the deeper meaning of a Jewish understanding that humor is one of the better ways, and sometimes the only way, to cope when darkness falls.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Holocaust film with an original storyline.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two reasons that lead me to watch this film:Firstly, it is a Holocaust film; the Holocaust is a period in history that had a huge impact on me. Secondly, it features my favourite actor and actress in the world: the great Robin Williams &amp; the wonderful Hannah Taylor Gordon. I have admired these two for years and to have two of your fave actors in one film is a very rare treat. The scenes with the two of them together are heartwarming.Williams plays Jakob Heynn, one of the hundreds of Jewish people living in a Polish ghetto in 1944, during World War II. After hearing radio broadcast announcing the Russians' approach, he tells of the possible end of the war, leading the ghetto inhabitants to believe he possesses a "hidden radio". This leads to him having to tell false rumours, thus increasing the hope of the inhabitants of the ghetto.It certainly feels odd to hearing Williams speak in a different accent, I can tell you. His performance, all the same, is as good as ever. Hannah Taylor Gordon, who plays the little girl who hides in Jakob's apartment, is just so lovely in her role. Having watched her stunning performance as Anne Frank in "Anne Frank: The Whole Story" previously, I have always admired Taylor Gordon, so to see her in this is, to me, a real marvel.The supporting cast also offers a great performance. It all makes this film that much inviting to watch.There is, of course, quite a bit of tragedy in this film. But, seeing as it is set during the Holocaust, that is to be expected. It's a way of showing respect to the memory of it all. If you don't like tragic scenes, let alone tragic films, then maybe this isn't for you. However, there is some humour in it, thanks to Williams.So, all in all, I'd say this film is one I'd recommend. It certainly has an original storyline and the whole thing offers a heartwarming experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a really good film to watch alone, when you are in a sensitive mood, ready to accept and understand the emotions and feelings of the characters. Even those who don't actually like films related to wars, might like this one,robin Williams has done a good job, but others in the cast are at times even better. Half true, comment from Williams,heard on the radio with the Nazis starts giving hope to the distressed common people , caught in a small town held by the Nazis. Jakob, then carries on the lie,and later is forced to carry on the lie, that he has a radio, to keep the hope alive, in the end dies , but doesn;t let go , just so that people already close to death under the Nazis, don't lose whatever hope that is left.You keep getting the feeling , that it could have been better made, with more focus on the emotional drama happening due to the situation. Good cinematography, If you are making a film portraying the emotion of hope , always there will be a difference in the way different people look at it, since things are relative to different people depending on their thought process. It could have been better, thats all can be said. But whatever there is , is a definite thing that all people who like good, sensitive cinema should watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't repeat the plot as many other comments have taken care of that. Many of Robin Williams' performances have been Robin Williams playing a character -- there's a wink and a hint that he'll bust out with some shtick at any time. He (or the director, or both) contain that impulse to an impressive degree in this movie and do so without the excessive sincerity that Williams often substitutes for emotion in his other parts. (Good Will Hunting contains an overrated performance of this type.) Example: in the scene where he takes on the voices of Churchill, Stalin, and others, it's wholly within his character's desire to persuade the little girl (who's wonderfully played, by the way) that hope remains. I agree that some of the actors, notably Alan Arkin, aren't very good, but other, less-well-known ones support the movie well. In addition, I thought the production design, cinematography, and editing were thoughtful and well-done. And I liked the ending...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hope, when it was most needed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was actually quite surprised that I enjoyed this movie as much as I did. The best film about the Holocaust by far was "Schindler's List", and I don't think that any film will be able to top that one. While this one doesn't come close (and it doesn't try), it is still an entertaining movie.Jakob Heym (Robin Williams) is a man living in one of the many Jewish ghettos of the time. While outside the ghetto, he hears a newscast on the radio which tells him the Russians are about 400 kilometers away from his home there. This starts a chain of events which lead the occupants of the ghetto to believe he has a radio hidden in his apartment, something which the Gestapo certainly frown upon. This allows Jakob to bring hope to the inhabitants of such a dreary place.Despite the darkness of the events that this storyline revolves around, this movie still contains some humor. Of course, with Robin Williams in it, we shouldn't expect any less. As Jakob says, "that was how we got by". Williams is above average in this film, but that's not to say that this is his best work to date. He is supported by an excellent cast, who are good in their roles, especially young Hannah Taylor-Gordon in the role of Lina.What brought this film down a couple of notches for me was the ending, which you will see when you watch it. It just didn't fit for me, I thought it might have been done a bit differently, with better results. The subject matter doesn't particularly dictate a happy-go-lucky ending to this film in any event. It isn't a happy ending, but... oh, never mind. I'll leave it up to you to watch it and make your own conclusions.My Rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good story of hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jakob" (Robin Williams) is a Jew living in a Nazi-occupied Polish ghetto where the residents have lost all hope. One night, he is ordered to report to the officer in charge after being caught outside, allegedly after curfew. While he was in the office, waiting to be reprimanded, he overhears a radio report about the advancing Russian troops.When he returns to the neighborhood, he informs his friends what he had heard. However, as the news spread, his story transformed into something else. People began to believe he had a radio hidden in his home as his story began traveling through the grapevine.This is simply a story of hope for those oppressed such as the Jews during the Nazi occupation so many decades ago. And it is done very well.Let me say that this movie is not a happy story. Even the ending is shadowed by sadness, though it does have a touch of happiness.Williams is very good in this film. He made his character compassionate to those in his neighborhood. As he told the stories, which were just stories to keep the Jews hopes up, you began to believe them just as much as those forced into the same situation as he was in the story. He was very believable as he told his fictional news.In fact, there were many good performances from the rest of the cast. You could actually feel the emotion from the entire cast. It was one of the most believable performances from an entire cast that I've seen in a long time.One thing you will notice is the lack of light, and color. You get lots of gray, black and white in clothing, as well as the walls (interior and exterior). This helps set the mood perfectly if you ask me. The only time I can recall any color was a shot of the Nazi flag.There is also a lack of happy music in the film. There is one scene between Williams and the young girl (Hannah Taylor Gordon) that is short, but it is a happy scene with fun music.Wardrobes are very accurate in this film. The Jews clothing look worn, and very dirty. They look as if they didn't wash their clothing in some time. The Nazi uniforms are also quite accurate in their appearance.The violence is fairly mild in this film. There is a little blood, far less than you would expect. The Nazi soldiers use machine guns against the Jews, but there is little to no blood splatter as they are apparently struck.There is also little to no action. Many of the scenes drag on, but many drag at an appropriate pace that works well.To parents, I would suggest that you avoid this one if you have young children. If you have kids who are able to understand the plot, then watch it with them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Jakob the Liar" is a bit better than I expected, and a lot more somber. While there are a few funny moments, the human condition being what it is will always find a laugh here and there, the film is primarily an account of how imprisoned Jews lived in their "ghetto" during the war, right before they were trained to an extermination camp. Robin Williams is good as Jacok, one of the Jews, who overhears a radio braodcast, mentions it to a friend, and soon everyone thinks Jakob is hiding a radio, something which would get him a quick death if discovered. However, he sees that it brings hope, suicides suddenly drop, so he keeps telling little lies of hope here and there, hope that the Russians will soon come to liberate them.Jakob gets in trouble with the Nazis, is asked to admit his crime, but he just laughs. He is shot as the others leave via train for execution. On the way Russion tanks meet the train, the Jews are free! Jakob is dead. This is a good role for Williams. I don't know if this has a particular historical accuracy, I don't really care, for it reminds us how truly evil the German Nazis were. This film is not a comedy, it is very somber indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why you should watch this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Williams delivers the finest performance I have been privileged to see him give. Jakob is a role he carries off with impressive realism, and which significantly deepened my respect for the man's acting talent.As a Jew in a Polish ghetto under the Nazis, Robin Williams portrays a man hurting from the loss of wife, freedom and friends. Suicides abound, and children have long since been killed or shipped away from the ghetto. The entire backdrop is bleak, broken only by the cynical humor the Jews have developed as the merest survival technique. The excellent film-making further supports the atmosphere by almost making you feel you've stepped into a black-and-white era, walking the streets with Williams, watching death and depression eat away at the whole neighborhood.Things begin to change when Jakob, summoned by the commandant, overhears a radio bulletin. Encouraged by the report that the Russians are mere hundreds of miles away - a very little distance in the great give and take of war - the Jews begin to take heart, and the suicide rate is reduced to nil. Things are complicated for Jakob when his friends start to believe that the bulletin came from a radio that Jakob owns - a radio which doesn't exist - and begin to hound him, some for more information, and some because they want him to destroy it before it destroys them.The impressive cinematography and the convincing acting from the entire cast make this movie a must-see. 8 out of 10, with the two taken off for an ending that didn't sit well with me, but than again, can you really expect a movie with the Holocaust as its subject matter to be easily stomached?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is being compared to Life is Beautiful as both movies are set in Nazi war camps, and the stars of both movies try to make life in the camp as optimistic as possible. In this film, Robin Williams plays a serious role as Jakob, a jewish resident in a war camp in nazi occupied Poland. He overhears a radio report that the Russians are moving in, speculating that WWII should be over soon. He tells a few fellow jewish residents that he heard this radio report, to help bring some hope and optimism in the cold,dreary,nazi camp where many people are dying from the hands of german soldiers, and from suicides. This report causes much excitement amongst the jews and the news travels faster than Jakob imagined. He notices how this news lifted the spirits of many of the jews so he continues to make up bogus reports and gives everyone the impression that he does in fact have a radio, which he does not.In the meantime, he is secretly taking care of a young girl in the camp and must try and keep the secret that he has no radio, from her as she is very much looking forward to getting out of the camp and seeing her parents again.I really liked this movie. It was nice to see Robin Williams play a serious role. I give this movie 8/10.</fullReview>

If only Hollywood would/could churn out fables of this sort en par with those produced by fledgling studios in Europe. Besides "The Pawnbroker", Hollywood has yet to produce a compelling, truthful, and responsible film that documents the Holocaust. "The Diary of Anne Frank" is just the tip of the emotional and historical iceberg. "Schindler's List" was an independent venture. Spielberg could not find anyone from the major studios to finance the project. If it hadn't been for Jewish groups who forced theatre chains to show the picture in many suburban areas, the movie would have gone unnoticed.One should also remember that "Jakob the Liar" is a remake. The original was a German film, produced in 1974. To say that this film is "too late" because it coincides with the release of "Life is Beautiful" is absurd. Only 55 years after the Holocaust, there ISN'T ENOUGH being said about that sad period. I would like to see an American film about the United States' blatant anti-semitic attitudes during WWII. "Exodus" isn't incisive; it's more of a white-washed apology.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the previlage of seeing this picture at the Toronto Film Festival. This was a touching picture, that will bring a tear to the eyes of many. It's about a single man, who hears a German propoganda broadcast, and relays information he's heard onto others in the ghetto, how ever his words are relayed and sometimes distorted. Some of the imformation is correct others ficitional, thus this is how his character is created. He see's how it gives his people a sense of secuirty, how it boisters their spirit, and gives them a sense that thier might be hope for them afterall. It is set in the ghetto of Poland, during the wartime. Mr. Williams does a wonderful job, and really conveyes the message in this film. Highly recommended. Oscar material in my books.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jakob the Liar Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1999 movie Jakob the Liar is based on the holocaust of World War II in Nazi occupied Poland. The film is about a guy named Jakob Heym (Robin Williams) and it is directed by Peter Kassovitz. My opinion of the film is that the way that the timezone was shown and the way it was screened was good, but personally I did NOT like the story. It was too overwhelming I think.During World War II in Nazi occupied Poland, poor Jewish café owner Jakob accidentally overhears a forbidden radio news, to fight the incredible depression and suicide throughout the ghetto, Jakob tells fictitious news bulletins about Allied advances against the Nazis. These lies keep hope and humor alive among the ghetto inhabitants. The Germans learn of the mythical radio, however, and begin a search for the resistance hero who dares operate it.The theme of this film is Hope v.s. Hopelessness, When Jakob relates this to a friend to keep him from doing something stupid, it becomes assumed that Jakob has a hidden radio. He is then pressed to tell more news. As long as there is news, there are no suicides in the ghetto. But before Jakob was accused, there was NO hope at all, there was at least one suicide each night.The film shows a very dark and gloomy environment it is part of WWII so there is a lot of depression, and sadness, and lots of suicides. People have to work a lot and they are not well taken care of, some of their families have been taken and put on the train, but the only thing that gives them hope is Jakob's "radio" and the hope that the Russian's are coming to save them.Jakob the Liar is overall an eyeopener. It makes you think "WOW! They really did that to people" and "This is Crazy" everything in the film is really a shock! They way it was put together was good, but I didn't like it that much because it just made me sad, I prefer Comedy. But, if you like Historical Fiction/Dramas this film is for YOU! I would rate this film a 6 on a scale to 1-10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was good, reminding me of 'Life Is Beautiful' without packing quite the punch that film did. I like Robin Williams in the serious roles and he does a great job here, sporting an indiscernible accent. A decent sub-cast here too including Alan Arkin, Armin Mueller-Stahl and Liev Schreiber. There is a lightness to the movie throughout, including the music but I wouldn't exactly call it a comedy, it has a few funny moments but the mood is generally dark, cold and hungry with Williams obviously toned down.This takes place in Nazi-occupied Poland during WW11 with Robin Williams as Jakob, a (former) café owner/pancake maker who accidentally overhears a forbidden German radio broadcast and then tries to boost the morale of his ghetto neighbors by inventing further fictitious news bulletins. I enjoyed the overall story here and how the radio took on a life of its own with Jakob almost forced into telling tales as his reports had begun to generate hope and lessen the overwhelming depression and suicides that prevailed over the ghetto. I also liked the young girl and her story -escaping a death train and living in the cellar. One of my favorite scenes involved her with Jakob pretending to be the radio announcer. Predictable ending to this but still very moving. 3/1/15</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Williams shines, but the rest is a tad drab.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in the Polish ghettos of late WW2 era Poland, the titular Jakob is a down on his luck café owner. One small slip up one night causes him to be sent briefly before the commandant. There, he catches news of the war off the German radio. Soon, tall tales begin to emerge around what Jakob heard, and that even he possesses a radio of his own. Initially reluctant, Jakob uses the lie to help bring hope to the desperate residents of the ghetto. While it may be slow and not walk as fine a balance as say, 'Life is Beautiful', this pseudo Holocaust dark-dramedy can still be admired for trying. Certainly another strong dramatic turn from the late Williams is a major note of importance, and probably his best performance from his 'sap years' (though his acting wasn't the issue with either 'Patch Adams' or 'Bicentennial Man'). He's very toned down and dour, but not without levity or a certain gusto to him that does make him endearing. In supporting roles we have the likes of Liev Schreiber, Alan Arkin, Hannah Taylor Gordon and Armin Mueller- Stahl who all turn in solid work, with Stahl being the highlight as the wise old doctor.Production wise, it's solid. Peter Kassovitz' direction is graceful and simple, allowing the foulness of the ghettos to speak for themselves, which are rather well recreated, and Edward Shearmur's score has an underlying whimsy though it can get morbid and sombre a number of times. Really, the faults lie more with the writing; there's a missing intensity, a missing gravity to this whole affair. The film just lacks the punch or viscerality or 'The Pianist' or 'Schindler's List', never feeling as horrifying or shocking as it can be, and none of the characters are as compelling as they should be. Not flat, but again, that lack of power does often leave things feeling a tad hollow. It's like Murray's 'The Razor's Edge'; a lot of the right components are here, yet it never muster up full emotion to become as powerful as it needs to be. That's not to say the movie is bad, as it is a perfectly serviceable WW2 drama, and from a perspective we don't often see. Still, could've been more.</fullReview>

I have never heard of it, and upon looking it up, it was a Box Office flop that was slated by critics, but that doesn't mean it's not a good movie that is worth checking out. Bob Balaban, Hannah Taylor Gordon, Liev Shrieber, Alan Arkin and the wonderful Michael Jeter (who I've been a fan of since I first seen him in the TV show "Evening Shade" with Burt Reynolds) all offer superb support to Williams who is excellent.When Williams is in roles like this I find he can really touch me.

		<fullReview>Review: I really enjoyed this movie. The storyline was fresh and very well directed and all of the actors made the film seem real and intense. It was amazing how a little lie, spiralled completely out of control and changed many people's life's. It brought hope to many people at a time when no one had any happiness in there life's. When everyone demands to see this radio, that completely didn't exist, Robin Williams lies get out of hand, to the point were it ends up destroying life's and causes trouble with his friends and love ones. You can't help feeling sorry for the main character who started out with good intentions but he really couldn't foresee the problems that the lie would cause. Anyway, the mixed emotions throughout the movie was very well thought through and really entertaining. I know that I'm a bit late with seeing this film, but I'm glad that I added it to my rental list because it would have been a shame if it passed me by. Enjoyable!Round-Up: This is yet another movie which shows Robin Williams in a different light. He used his comedic talent to bring a form of light to a terrible situation and the chemistry between all of the characters was brilliant. It seemed like all of the actors were long time friends which is why the film seemed so real. It might be the delicate subject matter, why the movie really bombed at the box office, or it might be the distribution which needed some more money behind it, but it is definitely under rated and it deserves a re-release after his sad passing.Budget: $45million Domestic Gross: $5million (Terrible!)I recommend this movie to people who are into there intense drama/comedies lie that spirals completely out of control and ends up destroying life's.&nbsp;7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams tries his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1944 Poland in a Jewish ghetto. Jakob (Robin Williams) is a pancake café owner. He gets commanded to the ghetto commander's office. He overhears broadcast from German radio about fighting close by. Later, he has to tell his boxer friend Mischa (Liev Schreiber). Only Mischa foolishly tells everybody that Jakob has a radio. Meanwhile, a girl Lina (Hannah Taylor Gordon) escapes from one of the trains to concentration camp.This is very much a made up story. The problem is that it's put in the all too real ghetto. It's a conflict that never gets better, and only gets worst with the ending. There is always this fakeness permeating throughout the movie. Yet the subject is so realistically portrayed.It is obvious that Robin Williams is trying his best. But maybe he's not the best person to play the role. He doesn't have the moral stability that the character desperately needs before his lying begins. We need a real boyscout. Liev Schreiber does what he needs for his character. However I wish he had an emotional breakdown to make him more 3 dimensional. Overall, it's a good effort, but it has too many awkwardness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK film that loses a little something in the delivery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jakob is in the ghetto with thousands of other Jews. They are all shut off from the outside world with no news from the war. When Jakob is caught outside after the curfew he is sent into the head office to receive punishment. He is sent back to the ghetto but manages to hear a snippet of news on a radio while there. He tells people the news but they don't believe that he could have gotten out of the office alive so assume he has an illegal radio. Jakob realises the positive affect his news has so continues to make up stories to fed the rumours ? all the while trying to protect an orphan who has come to him for help.While I had no great desire to see this film, I'll pretty much give anything a go when it comes onto terrestrial television (cheapo that I am!). It was for that reason that I found myself settling to watch Jakob the Liar with no real expectations or preconceived ideas. I must admit that I felt that the film could easily become some tasteless mawkish Robin Williams comedy in the ghetto but I did feel that the plot did manage to walk the line well between the comedy and the horrors. At times it did feel a little laboured as it tried to get laughs or comedy out of a very serious situation, and some of the scenes between Jakob and the orphan girl did feel like Williams settling back into well worn material.What the problem was for me was that it didn't really grab me until near the end, for the moat part it was almost as if the film could have become background noise for me as it wasn't well delivered and was a little flat. The comedy didn't totally work and took away from the light drama that came with the subject ? the `joke' of Jakob lying about his radio was dragged on longer than it could sustain and the film suffered a bit before getting serious for a strong finish. That said I did think that the story had it's merits and that maybe something had been lost in both translation to the screen and delivery.I think one of the weaknesses must be Williams himself. There is nothing out and out wrong about his performance but he just slip into a mode for much of the film ? his `grimace' and smile. The downside of this is that he tries to bring out the comedy instead of letting it just come trough without getting in the way of the drama. When he settles towards the end he is very good but during the film he appears uneasy about what type of role he is playing. The support cast is good and has the added benefit of being full of well known actors, giving the impression of quality in depth and adding interest as I felt I already had an interest in the support cast based on who was playing them. Arkin, Mueller-Stahl, Jeter and even Schreiber give good performances in support and added to Williams and even carried him when his mawkishness threatened to force it's way to the surface.Overall this is an OK film that didn't really grab my interest until the final act. Both Williams and the film appear uneasy about the mood they are trying to capture for the majority of the film but it is the dramatic side that comes off best in the long run ? and this is to the film's strength.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After viewing "Jakob the Liar", I would say it was an excellent movie about a dismal time in history. From beginning to end, the scenes of the ghetto, German officers headquarters and the work cite formed a good, quality background for the plot of the movie. Although the movie was dark and gloomy, this appearance was necessary to convey the everyday lifestyle of the Jews during that time period. Even during this stressful and disheartening time, Robin Williams, as Jakob, adds some much needed comic relief.</fullReview>

Bella' and thus was simply considered opportunist band-wagon riding, especially as it seemed to come into comparison with Spielberg's superb `Schindler's List', when in fact production and filming was well under way in Hungary and Czechoslovakia long before Benigni suddenly popped up like a rabbit in a top hat.Usually I would just pass over Robin Williams as I find most of his supposedly humourous attempts at playing rôles more than somewhat irritating; however perusing IMDb I got curioser and curioser. I am glad I did: the film is far from being a great one, but it is certainly endearing in the most part, parallel with other mixed feelings running from sorrowful and angst to comprehending smiles or even chuckles.An interesting thing, given during the presentation on the TV programme before showing the film, is what for me is `news': that Robin Williams devotes large amounts of his money to good causes, among which is the paying of all doctor's fees and rehabilitation for Christopher Reeve.The accompanying music is mostly Ashkenazi inspired, though I heard some which sounded more Sephardi.</fullReview>

You don't feel the same way as if you were watching Schindler's List but because the movie is not that depressing, it actually shows hope and because of a misunderstanding, Robin Williams charater must do all he can to raise the moral of his friends and a little girl that lives with him.PLOT: A Jewish pancake maker (Robin Williams) lives in a Jewish ghetto during WWII. By mistake one of his friends thinks he has a radio hidden from the Nazis. Because of this he must keep the ghetto's moral up by making them believe that freedom is on the way.VIEWS: Robin Williams does give a good performance and you sympathize by what he does. He is mainly the star in the movie but there are some that give good performances in their roles. Some parts are happy but there are some depressing moments. Instead of showing the whole picture, this movie show a small part of what it was like for the Jewish people during WWII.SCENES TO WATCH FOR: The arguing between Robin Williams and his barber friend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Filmmakers with the chutzpah to tackle the holocaust always have to tread along some pretty slippery ground. How does one visualize the unimaginable horrors of such an apocalyptic human event without flinching, yet make it all palatable enough to keep the audience from fleeing the theatre? In addition, one must always avoid offending any of the actuals survivors who rightfully bridle at the first sign of softening or sugarcoating. Precious few film have managed to accomplish this feat and transform the experience into works of lasting art. In addition to "Schindler's List," of course, two other successful films come to mind: the 1965 Czech masterpiece, "The Shop on Main Street," and the beautiful 1983 Hungarian film, "The Revolt of Job." One of the reasons these three films succeed is because they all approach the subject from the viewpoint of a gentile outsider who is drawn into the momentous event and whose consequent moral dilemma becomes the audience's own. Through this approach, the audience is put not in the position of a helpless victim, doomed to unimaginable suffering, but of a participant whose actions could stand the chance of affecting a positive outcome on at least a small scale. The result is that each of these films avoids the overwhelming sense of depression and hopelessness that otherwise would accompany this heavy subject matter. "Jakob the Liar," like the recent "Life is Beautiful," plunges us directly into the center of the horror - the Warsaw ghetto in the months right before the Russian invasion of Poland. Robin Williams portrays Jakob, a former restauranteur who, through a series of flukes, manages to convince his fellow captives that he has a hidden radio which continually broadcasts news of the Russians' advance. This results in a temporary renewal of hope and courage as the inhabitants of the ghetto begin a plan of insurrection.Despite obviously noble intentions, "Jacob the Liar," itself a remake of a 1976 Polish film, seems far too artificial in its story and performances to ring true. Although Williams gives a relatively restrained account of himself and keeps the unctiousness of many of his recent film portrayals down to a minimum, he is still recognizable as Robin Williams, replete with the occasional stand-up comedian schtick, such as when he acts out all the voices in an ersatz radio program for the benefit of a little girl who has become his inadvertant ward. All throughout the movie, the writers provide moments of inappropriate mirth and slapstick that rob the subject of the seriousness of its purpose. And, although one sympathizes with the reason for doing so, is it really necessary to provide such an upbeat finale to a supposedly serious holocaust drama? This merely emphasizes the artificiality of the whole enterprise.One hesitates to be too harsh on a film of this nature. Certainly, its makers were driven far more by their love of the subject than the expectation of great boxoffice success - and "Jakob the Liar" is certainly no disgraceful failure for which its makers need be ashamed. It simply misses its mark both as a chronicle of the horrors of the holocaust and as a work of art. To see how that can be done, please check out "The Shop on Main Street," which stands still as simply one of the greatest films ever made!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In "Jakob the Liar" Peter Kassovitz has directed Robin Williams and an impressive cast in a film that will invariably be compared to last year's `Life is Beautiful'. Williams portrays Jakob Heym, a pancake maker, living in a Polish ghetto in 1944. He inadvertently hears some news on the radio of a Nazi officer, and after innocently relaying it to some of his neighbors realizes it has instilled hope for the future in them. At the same time he becomes the surrogate father to a little girl who has escaped from a train as it was travelling toward a concentration camp. These two threads are woven into the daily lives of the ghetto, reflecting both humor and pathos. In spite of it all, something is missing that was present in `Life is Beautiful', possibly a passion for the material by the filmmakers. There may have been a questioning of whether the humorous aspects of the tale would fly in the face of the underlying tragedy, violence and horror. The supporting cast headed by Bob Balaban, Alan Arkin, Armin Mueller- Stahl, and Liev Schreiber (excellent as the husband in `Walk on the Moon') is effective and definitely add resonance to the proceedings. The little girl is sweetly portrayed by Hannah Taylor-Gordon, and her scene where she dances with Williams is one of the best in the film. If you enjoyed `Life is Beautiful', you might want to give this one a try. This is just one more perspective to the nightmare that Jews experienced in WWII that will make us appreciate our everyday lives in America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The whole truth...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jakob The Liar"Coming so soon after Roberto Benigni's "Life Of Beautiful", I'm not sure the cinematic world can bear another Holocaust fable. Benigni's film was a wonderful and tender tale of a father's love for his son during that horrific period in history. It treated the Jewish Holocaust with respect, yet retained a light comedic tone. It's a balance that very difficult to pull off. "Jakob The Liar" is similar in many ways. Filmed in 1997, the movie is finally being released. It's timing couldn't be worse, only because this new film cannot hold a candle to Benigni's triumph.Robin Williams stars as Jakob, a lonely widower stuck in a Jewish Ghetto in 1945. Trying to maintain a life while the horrors of the German atrocities surround him, he survives with the help of his humor and his small circle of friends. When Jakob is stopped past curfew one night, he hears a report on the radio of Russian Forces getting closer to liberating the death camps. Excited at the good news, Jakob reports the intelligence to his friends, suggesting that this information came from a radio he owns. The inhabitants of the ghetto become excited at the news and pressure Jakob for more. Without ever really owning a radio, Jakob begins to falsely create stories to please the ghetto. By doing this, Jakob lifts the morale of the ghetto but also places the entire population in danger from the German army. Also in the mix is a ten year-old girl who has escaped from a train in route to a death camp and has managed to fall into Jakob's care.Sufficed to say, Robin Williams is coming off his most critically lambasted year. The double punch of the woefully underrated "What Dreams May Come" and the misunderstood "Patch Adams" has set back the actor quite a bit in the eyes of the critical community. With audiences, Williams can do no wrong. Both "Dreams" and "Patch" were extremely successful. They've come to expect the same dramatic yet sillyheart performance from Williams. "Jakob" doesn't ask a lot of Mr. Williams's core audience. I like Robin, but "Jakob" just isn't the role for him. The performance is way too similar to ones that have come before. His pained dramatic look while trying to make the whole world happy is very admirable, but he needs to stop making these movies (Robin Williams and his wife produced this film for their Blue Wolf Productions, so it really is their fault). Mr. Williams is beyond gifted. He has enough range and instincts to soar high in original roles. It's too bad he always stoops to the "Save the world" message films instead of challenging work.Director Peter Kassovitz makes a strong impression with the look of "Jakob The Liar". The dirty, muddy, run down feel of a Jewish Ghetto towards the end of the war is very palpable in the movie. I cannot recall (even "Schindler's List") a holocaust movie that made you feel like you were part of the experience. It's parts frightening and remarkable. The camera weaves through the work day of the prisoners and you feel like one of them. The supporting cast of great actors like Liev Schreiber, Alan Arkin, and Bob Balaban also contribute to the overall mood with their extremely believable camaraderie. When "Jakob" begins to break down, the whole film falls apart. The Germans suspect a radio is on the premises and the entire movie suddenly becomes a myriad of clichés. The PG-13 rating is also stretched a bit with graphic scenes of torture and mayhem. "Jakob" was a fine film when the focus was kept small and personal. I didn't need screenwriting 101 to tell me that a tragic climax would make the film more satisfying. It's a crying shame that Williams and Kassovitz needed to drag the audience through the typical dramatic routine, even more depressing since the ending is practically shot for shot the same as "Life Is Beautiful". Keeping the story in check should have been the first priority."Jakob The Liar" is the first holocaust film in which I feel the story didn't need to be told. While I can easily recommend the first 70 minutes of the film, the aftertaste suggests that the ending ruined things beyond repair. The holocaust is a delicate thing, and "Jakob" isn't offensive, it's just too late. ------------- 6</fullReview>

It was little more than another potential Oscar vehicle for Williams who seemed to forget that an Oscar winning performance requires more than the addition of a Ghetto, a few nazi uniforms and a thick Polish accent.The plot was transparent, the characters cliched and the ending....... could it get any worse? A few witty lines did little to add humour to the situation, and didn't detract from the fundamental lack of originality that this movie possessed.Although there has been comparisons to Life is Beautiful, I fail to see how anyone recognises the similarities. Life is beautiful was a masterfully gifted story of hope and survival; Jakob the Liar promised so much but delivered so little.Williams' brief reprisal of his Good Morning Vietnam talent as a "radio announcer" was the only part that caught my interest and that was out of sheer nostalgia. Don't bother renting this movie- should you ever feel the urge, turn on the Bold and the Beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrible, disgusting, festering sore of a Holocaust film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This will include ***SPOILERS***, but take my advice now and don't ever see this movie. Jakob the Liar is based on the Jurek Becker novel "Jakob, der Lügner" (the same title, but in German). The 1975 film with an untranslated and identical title was the first film adaptation and actually the original idea for the text. The East German film production companies at the time would not make the movie, so Becker wrote a novel. The novel was published in both Germanies at the same time and was huge, so the movie idea became a reality and was also published in both Germanies at the same time. Stick with the originals on this, please, I cannot stress this enough.The 1999 Jakob the Liar is an affront to the memory of the Holocaust. This COMEDY focuses around the character of Jakob, a Jewish café owner who now lives in an unnamed Jewish ghetto in Poland, about 400km southwest of Bezanika. Jakob is portrayed by Robin Williams, who, of late, has tried to shift the stereotype of his quite length string of goofy comedies to more serious roles (Patch Adams, Insomnia, One Hour Photo, etc.). It brings me no pleasure to say that he fails in this film. His goofy smile, jokes in pitiful context, and even some work with crazy voices all seem immensely out of place. The film is about bringing hope to the hopeless and doomed to die, not about bringing an occasional laugh to a viewer who couldn't bear to actually take a movie seriously.Apart from the many pointless changes in this movie from the original film, there are quite a number of rather detracting changes that succeed only in making the whole tale much more unbelievable. Max Frankfurter (Felix in the original) seems to have kept a sizeable portion of wealth with him while most of the city fell into absolute squalor. In addition to hiding a radio (as he did in the original), he also has a working German revolver as a prop he used in his days as an actor, but he also has hidden a fine chess set (checkers in the original) and what appears to be a couple of sets of china and crystal. Professor Kirchbaum (just Professor originally) also has a rather large and well-decorated home (for the ghetto), and has managed to hang on to some medicine, a large set of crystalware, and a bottle of fine brandy. Jakob himself--while he doesn't have a radio--has managed to keep a turntable in pristine condition down in his café. Apparently, in this ghetto, the Nazis didn't even bother opening a closet to confiscate contraband from the imprisoned Jews.Comical music plays every time the Jews are lined up to be fed, and they apparently dance around in line under orders before eating. Either this is some bizarre Nazi custom that has simply never before been addressed, or it just makes no sense whatsoever. Jakob's friend Kowalski also seems to have a wonderful time giving Jakob his free shave every day, regardless of any work that he or anyone else at his shop might have to do. Work days in the ghetto weren't exactly short, and didn't leave one happy and ready to go play.During one work day, Herschel (Herschel Schtamm in the original) is shot for talking to whomever is imprisoned in the train. In the original, he sneaks up behind the car and the rest of the Jews carry on work to avoid suspicion. In this new version, the entire freaking work crew steps up and stares at Herschel as he makes a break to tell news to the train prisoners. Way to work together.In the original, Jakob tells Mischa about the radio so that Mischa will not try to steal potatoes and get himself killed before even reaching the crates. He only speaks of news later in passing, and even then very rarely. In the new version, Jakob indulges the lies, making them grand and ridiculous. Yes, this plays on the peoples' need to hope, but it also makes the news much more comical and out-of-place.Jakob finds Lina outside the walls, and insists on sneaking back in instead of chancing it outside. They had a better chance of living if they were out, as all ghettos were eventually liquidated; they were fortunate to have lasted until 1944. They sneak back in through a hole in the fence. If they knew about such an easy way to escape, why not tell people so that at least some could flee? In any case, it was more real than the radio.In this film, Jakob is tortured and martyred, refusing to destroy the hopes of the ghetto prisoners. The Nazis could easily have shot him sooner, but they first attempted to break the morale of a ghetto that was going to be shipped off to the death camps in less than twenty-four hours anyway. How brilliant. The prisoners are then loaded onto the train and shipped off, only to be saved 50km outside of town by a Russian tank division who, for some reason, had a small band traveling with them (the accordion and accompaniment, not the dream sequence). What a nice and happy and TOTALLY UNREALISTIC ending to a comical movie about the Holocaust. In the original, Jakob, Lina, Mischa, Rosa, and everybody else are all shipped off in the trains and the film fades to black. Any ideas about a Russian division saving them are simply na?ve. They all died, and that was the reality of life in the ghetto. Jurek Becker (the author, remember) spent eight years in the camps himself. He survived, but he wasn't part of any majority. It wasn't an unlucky few that were gassed and incinerated; it was six million people, and that was just the Jews. That's like killing everyone in the state of Washington and then making a movie about an entire city that survived by some random stroke of luck. It didn't happen that way, and that's not how it should be remembered. Hollywood needs to open its eyes if it thinks that this is any kind of representation of the Holocaust.1/10 It might deserve more as a solitary film without any context at all, but this is a movie about the Holocaust. Disgusting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first, "Jakob The Liar" is quite a good film... if you have not read the book by Jurek Becker.I read the book before I knew the movie was shot, but all the time I thought "If there is a movie, Robin Williams would be the best Jacob." Well, I was right. There is nothing to complain about RW.BUT: There is a lot to complain about the movie. (Spoilers)The End is completely wasted. In the book, there are two endings. Becker writes: "This story could end on two ways: The one I'd like to have, and the one that happened."Hollywood shows us the "Happy End", in which Jakob dies as a hero. But the "real" end is far more depressing: Jacob was deported and dies with the little girl in Auschwitz. Short and without every romance in it.This is the "magic moment" of the book, and as it's not in the movie, the movie will NEVER be really good. After all, it shows the "American Look" on Nazi-Germany: Good guys here, Bad guys there. OFC it's right, but a little bit short handed.Okay, it's hard to show the whole spectrum of this time. Neither "Schindler's List" nor "Jakob The Liar" can do this. Okay, okay, they don't have to. But watch "Stalingrad", a german movie about WWII, and you'll see another view of all this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard a lot of critics complain about this movie. I absolutely liked this film. However, it had 2 major failings:1) It was a remake of a East German classic that was award-worthy, and had a high standard to the art film critics.2) A Beautiful Life (La vita E Bella) had won best picture accolades 1 year earlier, and the stories have many similarities.Neither of these are the fault of the movie. They were just 2 insurmountable odds it had to fight. For that reason, the movie failed miserably.However, it really is a good movie. I can't speak for the original version, but I can say that while this movie was good, it's just not great.Robin Williams does a great job as the reluctant "hero" and the supporting cast was solid. When Robin is controlled in his performance, he can really shine and this definitely shows you what is to come from him in the near future for dramatic roles. There is still some humor, but it's directed and not totally off the wall.If you are interested in this era of history, I would recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of Jewish life in a Nazi ghetto during WW2, this is very depressing. I believe the reality was probably much worse than depicted here (they have electricity in the film) and everyone seems quite well-fed. At any rate, rumors get started within the ghetto that Jakob (Robin Williams) has a forbidden radio. Everyone presses him for news so he begins to make it up. He is believed and the Jews take great hope in his good tidings. Eventually, however, the Nazis find out and someone must pay. I'll not spoil it for you. I think this is a very worthwhile film. Robin Williams is excellent in it. It is nowhere near factual but wasn't intended to be. Give it a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, let's be honest, that film is NOT 'Schindler's List' and (except Williams) doesn't have any one Liam Neeson or Ben Kingsley lookalike credited. Don't expecting anything new I spent my time on this film. I don't feel sorry for them, but... Everything except Williams' acting is lower than average - wooden directing, so-so dialogues... It possibly was about to repeat the triumph of 'Life is Beautiful' (which I simply dislike in any way)but remains a grey copy of a Bravado a-la-Benigni. Robin Williams here is great (as everywhere) of course, but this is surely not the director's triumph, I cannot see any directing here... And listen, people, does Robin Williams associate in your mind with this Kind Jewish Grandpa somewhere in occupied Poland or Hungary? I think not. I think it will rather be 'Good Will Hunting' (I think brilliant role), 'Mrs. Doubtfire', or 'Hook'. And 'Schindler's List' looks so shocking and realistic mostly because we did not have Bruce Willis or Tom Cruise as Schindler, Julia Roberts as his wife, and Bradd Pitt, Nicole Kidman, Gwyneth Paltrow, Tom Hanks (and so on and so on and so on) as miserable jews. Only that way the story can be told as powerful and thought provoking as it was done by Steven Spielberg. Or maybe I misunderstood something? Maybe that's another Holocaust comedy? Then it's thousand time worse. Even worse than "Life is Beautiful' And then I've read somewhere on IMDB that this movie costs about $20 millions. Whaaat? 'Schindler's List' was about $32 millions. Is that a joke? Ok. Ok. On the whole I cannot strongly recommend you this one, cause this movie is so inert, empty like... I even don't know what. Seems like Peter Kassovitz didn't care much of this topic - it's not even 10% as deep as in Spielberg's heart. So what we have is a pretentious movie which you'll forget as easy as you watch it.</fullReview>

This film is depressing and i suppose the subject matter can be nothing but wht makes it so Disapointing is that the setting looks cheap. There are some very good actors in this movie but the budget must have been spent bon their wages and not the set. Perhaps im being a little unfair because Jacob the Liar is not a bad film and a 6 out of 10 rating that i give it shows that but it could have been so much better. Next time you read a script Mr Williams try going fot one with less Smaltz because who can forget Patch Adams? AAAHHHHH! 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me say, first that I enjoyed the movie intensely. It is a different kind of Holocaust film--showing the monotony as defined by the small breaks a highly sarcastic Jewish sense of humour provides. The characters are all relatively well developed--well enough that their performances are more like windows into their lives than a documentation of their entire existence--as some movies can make the characters seem flat an uninteresting, this movie reveals each characters' wrinkles of personality. The set is realistic, the script smart, the story one that you will want to go back to.Particularly, I think this is a good movie to introduce younger or more sensitive audiences to the history of the Polish Ghettos. Realism that deepens if you have a backround familiarity w/the issues at hand, it is not overwhelming--despite the inevitable (although poignantly unexpected) culmination of a whirlwind of events which unfold w/the introduction of news to the Ghetto. Classically themed cultural interpretations of the forced lifestyle of the characters promotes the effect of a rumour that a working radio exists in the Ghetto, allowing a lowly pancake-vendor to raise to heroic proportions amidst his small group of associates and lie in the face of hope-dashing truth (w/the support of the medicine-less cardiologist). The story lends credence to the irrefutable spirit of human life despite seemingly unsurmountable odds as Jakob deals w/the consequences of either perpetuating his lie or coming out w/the whole truth, weighing hope against despair. Swept up in his own joking accident and a few well-timed coincidences, endorsed by the Ghetto residents, the Ghetto organizes to resist their Nazi oppressors. As the fall of the Third Reich becomes more and more likely, the tangle of truth and falsity tightens around Jakob and each lie becomes more and more needed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you don't have anything better to do, watching JAKOB THE LIAR seems almost worth your while. At times interesting, at times tedious, this is an average drama about a man who creates hope through lies. It also ends fittingly, on a lie.The presence of European veteran actors like Armin Mueller-Stahl and Ági Margittay compensate somewhat for the over-acting of Robin Williams. The great Williams is one of the most versatile performers of our time but here he just seems to try TOO hard. The cigar goes to Liev Schreiber.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jakob the Liar suffers from "too much of a good thing".To me the movie looked interesting and good, but it is a remake so why not see the original. Also, Life is Beautiful, Schindler's List, and other movies about the holocaust came out near the same period (within years).So, why was this movie made?I really don't know. Taken my itself the movie is good to great. It has a story, a message, interesting bits, some funny moments, the idea that a lie can save lifes, but still get you into immense trouble, the idea that gossip still gets people scared, and the idea that anything is possible.However, while I don't see a direct parallel to the ending of Life is Beautiful, movies like Life I.S. or S.L. are better and I would see them first.Therefore, it is no surprise that Jakob made a quick entry and exit into the market.Viewed on tape.

		<fullReview>I liked the movie but felt it was uneven and lacked consistency. I did not expect the movie to be constantly intense. Jacob's lying was actually a small portion of the movie and he spent too much time worrying about the impact of his lies. Clearly his lies became beneficial under the circumstances he was in as a Jew in occupied Poland during 1944. He also spent to much time worrying about what others would think and this made him appear indecisive and often uncertain. This was especially true after he learned the positive affects of his lies which gave his fellow Jews hope.</fullReview>

"Jakob the Liar" is better than average, and has some strong moments primarily due to some semi-autobiographical elements added by director Peter Kassovitz.But the film does drag in parts. Robin Williams is not the best choice for the lead role, although he does give an adequate performance.Although the remake does stand on its own, I do remember the original version has having a stronger emotional impact. The original was also the forerunner of such German-made WWII and Holocaust films as, "The Tin Drum," "Europa, Europa," "The Nasty Girl," and "My Mother's Courage."

		<fullReview>Well, I decided to finally see this film tonight after first sitting through a dreadful film - "Falling To Peaces". I was the only one in the theatre except for a family of 4 sitting in front of me. The movie started off pretty interestingly where Robin Williams is desperately trying to grab a piece of newspaper that has flown into the ghetto, yet it keeps lifting in the air just beyond his reach. This was really the only part of the movie that caught my attention, because after a few minutes, I found myself noticing the poor "polish" accents coming out of the mouths of well-known american actors, especially Allen Arkin - that was the worst. I just felt that these actors were so well known, and some just didn't seem jewish at all, the whole thing just seemed incredibly contrived and unbelievable. This is my first review ever, so bear with me, but the feeling I had during most of the movie, was that this was a "groaner" as I call them. Movies that I sit through and say to myself through most of it - oh boy, this is pretty bad. I just couldn't help comparing it to Life is Beautiful - whose story is so much more compelling, interesting, funny, beautifully done, and more tugging on the heartstrings. I thought Jakob the Liar was basically a total waste of time. Sorry to all of those who loved this movie - it just seemed stale to me, and I kept having the feeling that "I've seen that scene before in another movie, and the other movie was much more creative." The part where he pretended that he was the radio when his 10 year old boarder was looking the other way - I mean, come on. That was really bad! I give it a 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's easy to rag this movie as being just another Holocaust movie with corny, improbable and fantastically unrealistic plot which glosses over the horrors of the Holocaust and minimizes the suffering of its victims. But ... BUT ... this is still a good movie. Robin Williams gives one of his better performances as a Jew who tries to instill hope in an otherwise seemingly hopeless situation. True the film offers a stagy and almost romanticized version of life in a Jewish ghetto in World War Two, but the film includes some harrowing scenes of the Germans rounding up the Jews as well as other abuses which remind the audience of the criminal nature of the Nazi German regime. It's not a great movie but it's still watchable.A surprising feature of this movie is how Robin Williams is made to look like a downtrodden Jew. He not only acts the role, he looks it too. Also there is a poignancy in this film which may seem out of place for such an otherwise depressing setting and the inclusion of the ten-year-old girl is an obvious contrivance, but still the movie is good and avoids the pitfall of trivializing the horrible conditions that so many innocent people were forced to suffer. One can only imagine the utter despair of the ghetto victims, made worse by their isolation. This movie dramatizes what happens when the people are given hope, no matter how slim. It kept them alive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just doesn't reach its potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course it's very timely that "Life is Beautiful" was released around the same time as "Jakob the Liar." I just rented this film today, but I still have to say I was reminded of the much-better Benigni masterpiece.This movie gives us a theatrical look at the Holocaust. A world where you can hide in a dark corner and the Germans will not catch you. A world where death and torcher is used only for plot devices. Sure, "Life is Beautiful" was a light comic look at coping with the rigors of the Depression Era, but it also had its many dark elements. Nothing was sugar-coated, it still kept a realistic tone. When you're watching a movie dealing with the subject of the Holocaust, you can't help but expect something compelling and touching. "Jakob" falls short of that compelling potential, and its attempt at comedy seems restrained as well. Robin Williams does his best to overcome the shortcomings of a mediocre script. Yet at the same time, he can't just let it all out and let himself run free like he's done in past films like "The Birdcage" and "Mrs. Doubtfire." There are moments where you know Robin wants to do or say something hysterical, but he restrains himself with a reassuring frown to try to keep up with the sentimental tone. So don't expect to see Robin at his best.The thick Polish accents are also distracting. Since this is a predominantly dialogue-driven film, the accents make it hard to follow. Even if I was able to decipher every word that came out of their mouths, the plot would still move at a slow pace and I would still be bored. The ending is sad, yet not in a tearjerking sense. As I said, every tragic moment is used as a plot device, and I pretty much saw it coming. "Jakob the Liar" is not a bad film, and is fairly watchable (though you might want to watch it in bits and pieces like I did), but you can't help but feel a lot more could've been done with the intriguing premise. There's times where you wish it could've been funnier, there's time you wish it could've been more dramatic. If you want to see a better look at the Holocaust, watch "Life is Beautiful" or "Schindler's List." My score: 5 (out of 10)</fullReview>

This person is Jakob Heym (played with a certain degree of credibility by Robin Williams) who used to be a deli owner, but now is all alone, and finds a lost Jewish girl in the process.

		<fullReview>Steve Allen once wrote in his book 'Funny People' that only certain actors could pull off serious roles. He actually made a list saying which were believable and which weren't. (Yes, Steverino put himself on the believable list) In the 'Unbelievable' list, he put Robin Williams. Now granted, this was way before his performance in Dead Poets Society and Good Will Hunting. But sometimes, Robin Williams just tries wayyy to hard for that serious role. so hard that you can just see his eyes squinting for that Oscar. (Cases in point, What Dreams May Come, Being Human, Patch Adams) etc. Another in these canon of films is the mightily high-horsed "Jakob The Liar" about a Jew in a concentration camp who, after heating some passing radio news about the advancement of Russian Forces towards the Warsaw Ghetton, passes along the word, only to have the news explode into wild speculation, so much so, that he is forced to contribute to it, when this type of news brings some sort of bleak optimism to the camp. Now this is a strong story no doubt, and it's been done before, but I found Robin Williams to be too miscast in this when someone else, say a Jean-Marc Barr or even a Ralph Fiennes would have been better. But the the supporting cast is terrific. I just love anything Liev Schreiber does, Bob Balaban and Armin Mueller-Stahl are great as well, and Alan Arkin is more strange casting, but he's amusing strange casting. All in all, I'd say go with the original, (good luck finding it).</fullReview>

This isn't a new genre: "Hogan's Heroes" made light of prisoners of war some years ago, but still had enough distancing so as not to cause a tremendous uproar amongst the real former prisoners who had to endure, deplorable humorless conditions. And apparently, after some 50-odd years, the off-limits tape for slapstick comedians playing Jewish victims of the Holocaust has been cut as well. This time the "silver-lining in every train bound to Auschwitz is presented in Robin Williams' gauche production, "Jakob The Liar"...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was awful. There's no other way to say it. It took an awful historical event and trivialized it. C'mon, 11 million people died and our messenger of this is Robin Williams? Okay, fine. He was a great Mork, an incredible Mrs. Doubtfire...but not a war-worn jew! He adds impersonations and incredibly insensitive comedy to the film. But I suppose it isn't all his fault. For even without him, this movie would ring a very false note (right down to the english-speaking, accent-muddled guards).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Holocaust Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roberto Benigni's 1997 Italian Oscar winning hit "Life Is Beautiful" shares the same Holocaust theme as "Jakob The Liar". This took some of the steam off "Jakob The Liar". While "Life Is Beautiful" was a huge critical hit, "Jakob The Liar" was not as appreciated. Robin Williams puts in a surprising performance in this heartfelt, touching, interessting, and beautiful movie about a group of Jewish people in a Nazi German ghetto. I liked this film a lot and you will too. A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a funny Jew</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is the story of a Jew, that stepped by accident in a complicated situation. Kept into one of the many German concentration camps, he got to know that front line comes closer. A Russian advance would mean to be restored to freedom. But knowing this he has to see how his companions and friends commit suicide. So he has the chance to stop it, telling them of the news. It is alluring but unmoral, cause he has to lie. Nobody would believe him the true story, so he fakes up a radio.Jurek Becker created one of the most sensitive and heartbreaking plots for Holocaust films. Marcel Reich-Ranicki praised him for inventing the "principle radio". But this hollywoody holocaustic thingy can't deal the complexity. Jacob is presented as just a funny Jew, that loves his people. It does not deal with the problem of Jewish identity, which is one of the central themes. It even naively adopts stereotypes Nazis used. This adaption sacrifices density for simplicity and compatibility.This Movie is just an entertaining film, an audience preferring a more deep and dense plot should look the GDR production, for which Jurek Becker himself made the screenplay and earned the first and only Oscar nomination an East German film ever got.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OH HELL NO!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate to attack another Holocaust Movie but what in Gods name was the point of this movie. I mean with such great movies as Schinflers List and Life is Beautiful we kid this poor excuse for a film. Robin Williams' acting was not its best, and has not been ever since that Patch Adams movie came out. I mean the Russians were not exactly the best liberators for the Jews either, jsut a notch up from the Germans. Also, i found it very hard to become attached or feel anything for the charachters. I mean when some people are shot i felt nothing....unlike Life is Beautiful when one usually leaves with a tissue box in hand. Personally i would rather sit through Bent, it at least at comedic elements. Oh and why the hell was Liev Schreiber in it. His characther was almost as believeable as Gweyneths acceptance speech! acchhh</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>no comparisons with "Life is Beautiful", please</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I want to say that Robin Williams is one of my favorite actors, and one of the funniest people alive today. Which makes it all the more disappointing that he doesn't get to do anything in "Jakob the Liar". A lot of people compared this movie to "Life is Beautiful"; if anything, it just ripped that one off. This story of a Jewish man in Nazi-occupied Poland trying to give everyone hope just can't create a believable presence. It's not terrible, just nothing creative. And I'm probably not the only person who thinks that Williams's career hit an all time low in 1999, as he starred in this and the apparently dreadful "Bicentennial Man". Fortunately, he's made a comeback since then (I expect a cool performance from him in "Night at the Museum").Also starring Alan Arkin, Bob Balaban, Michael Jeter, Armin Mueller-Stahl and Liev Schreiber; they probably and Williams want to downplay this movie when describing their careers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the movie was sad and slow. This movie is not for kids, not even for teenagers. I thought this movie should have been rated r. It was very hard to watch. I will never see it again. I don't think they should make a movie like this again.</fullReview>
