		<shortDescription>Insert Clever Werewolf Joke Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It wasn't the first werewolf movie (that honor goes to `Werewolf of London'), but it was `The Wolf Man' that gives us most of the werewolf mythology we still cling to today.As with most classics, `The Wolf Man' draws its power from a combination of elements. First, there's Curt Siodmak's plausible and intelligent script. Siodmak said he was given a title, a star and a start date, and from there he consolidated and invented the werewolf myth into a cohesive, logical format.Then there's the actors, a veritable who's who of 1930s-40s Universal horror. Lon Chaney joins the pantheon on great horror actors on this one, playing the tormented Larry Talbot. He manages to give Larry a tragic quality, a man trapped by a curse he doesn't understand or deserve. Chaney also generates considerable chemistry with the luminous Evelyn Ankers, which is surprising considering the rumors that the two practically hated each other. And then there's the always-excellent Claude Rains, who doesn't look very much like Lon Chaney's father, but still exudes quiet authority and authenticity.Topping off the whole package is a healthy dollop of atmosphere: foggy forests, Gothic mansions and crypts, colorful Gypsy encampments. Each bit of design enhances the sense of mystery and dread that surround Larry Talbot, and burns `The Wolf Man' into your memory.I'll never walk a foggy forest at night again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lon Chaney Jr's signature role is still one of his best performances. 'The Wolf Man' is an undisputed horror classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lon Chaney Jr lived under the shadow of his famous father, but in 'The Wolf Man' he helped create a horror icon that has lasted for over sixty years. Chaney had already shown that he could act in 'Of Mice And Men'(1939). In 'The Wolf Man' he gives another excellent performance, but this movie was both a blessing and a curse to his career I think. It forever labeled him a horror actor, and frankly he made a lot of lousy movies after this. Some good ones too, don't get me wrong, but too often he was given b-grade material to work with. Maybe his drinking problem had a lot to do with it, I don't know, but apart from a strong cameo in 'The Defiant Ones'(1958) and a great performance in Jack Hill's cult classic 'Spider Baby'(1964), he rarely was given a role as good as Larry Talbot in this movie. Chaney is surrounded by a very strong supporting cast including horror legends Claude Rains ('The Invisible Man') and Bela Lugosi (sadly only a cameo), Ralph Bellamy ('His Girl Friday'), and frequent costar Evelyn Ankers (she and Chaney made a great on screen couple but apparently hated each other off screen. Such is Hollywood!). Many people complain about the casting of Rains and Chaney as father and son. I agree it's totally unrealistic, but I don't think it hurts the movie at all. The lack of Lugosi is a bigger problem. There was more footage of him but unfortunately it wasn't used in the final cut. It's too bad as more scenes between Lugosi and Chaney would have been a treat. Of course they worked together a few times after this, but mostly in lesser movies. The real scene stealer in 'The Wolf Man' is Maria Ouspenskaya who plays the gypsy woman Maleva. She's just terrific, and gives the most memorable performance after Chaney. 'The Wolf Man' has had an enormous influence on just about every subsequent werewolf movie. Much of the lore seen on screen here isn't in fact traditional, as many people assume, but created by the talented Curt Siodmak ('Donovan's Brain') who subsequently wrote the horror classics 'I Walked With A Zombie'(1943), and 'The Beast With Five Fingers'(1946). 'The Wolf Man' is an undisputed horror classic, and just as entertaining and interesting as it ever was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rising Of the Moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As werewolf movies go The Wolf Man is probably the best. It was written by Curt Siodmak and directed by George Waggner. The script, though it gets the job done, has altogether too many wolf and dog references in it for comfort, many in the first fifteen minutes. A horror movie should never at the outset tell you that it is a horror movie. The title and and cast often give this away anyway, I grant, not to mention lobby cards and reviews. But the idea is or should be to draw the viewer in slowly, enabling him to acclimatize himself to the people and atmosphere so that the horror can, as it were, creep up on him. For all its excellent qualities The Wolf Man does not do this. Otherwise it works fairly nicely.A thoroughly Americanized Larry Talbot arrives at the estate of his British father, Sir John (A baronet? I wish they'd made this clear). Aside from the fact that he is three times larger than his father and altogether different in temperament (shy and fumbling as opposed to assertive and incisive), the two hit it off well enough. Larry has returned from the States due to the death of his brother, and Sir John clearly wants Larry to take his place (whatever it is) in the village. Larry spies on a young woman through a telescope (Sir John is an astronomer), and goes to her shop, where he buys a cane, with a wolf's head, and asks her for a date. She agrees, but when they meet later on she brings a friend, just in case Larry gets too, well, wolfish. It is autumn and the gypsies are in town. Larry his girl and her friend go to a fortune teller to get their palms read. The palm-reader sees death in the friend's hand and urges her to go. Later on, in the form of a wolf, he attacks and kills the girl, and is in turn killed by Larry with his cane; but Larry is bitten by the wolf, which guarantees that he will become one, too. In time Larry does indeed become a werewolf, but as with everything else in his life only goes half-way. While the animal that attacked him was a wolf, Larry becomes only partly wolf in appearance, though when the transformation occurs he is wholly wolf in spirit, yet walks on two human, albeit furry legs. He is more or less adopted by the dead Gypsy fortune teller's mother, who looks after him, and has a way of turning up in her wagon at appropriate moments. She also recites a poem about werewolfery (or lycanthropy if you will), which I shall not repeat here and which everyone in the village seems to know by heart. Sir John, being a man of science, does not believe that his son is a true werewolf but suffering from some form of mental illness. Yet when the moon rises Larry turns into a werewolf and goes on rampages.The Wolf Man is quite well made on what appears to be, for its studio, a generous budget; fog swirls everywhere, and the landscape is dominated by gnarled, leafless trees. It's tone is evocative of the Sherlock Holmes films, though not of course the content. There are so many good and bad things in the picture they're difficult to enumerate, and are often jumbled together. Of the bad, the casting of Americans Evelyn Ankers and Ralph Bellamy as Brits. Neither give a bad performance, but they don't belong in this film. It's difficult enough to keep one's disbelief in suspension with Lon Chaney on hand, but the addition of these two is a bit too much. Claude Rains, as Sir John, is a great asset to the movie, giving it a touch class and gravitas. His occasionally supercilious manner is in keeping in with the part he plays; and though he doesn't look at all like Chaney's father, he acts it. Maria Ouspenskaya and Bela Lugosi make marvelous gypsies, and they play their parts sincerely, with none of the hamming one might expect. Chaney's Larry Talbot became, after his Lennie in Of Mice and Men, his most famous role. He is sincere if somewhat phlegmatic in his 'normal' scenes, and early on, before the wolf-bite, lacks the joi de vivre he ought to have, as he is supposed to be a carefree young man. Chaney never seemed carefree. On the other hand his tragic, deeply lined face, sad eyes and prematurely middle-aged appearance suggests a troubled soul,--not an easy thing to fake--and in this regard he is magnificent in the part. His worry, over the prospect of another werewolf transformation, and the damage it will cause, appears genuine, and to a degree seems to come at times from outside the character he is playing, which as we know Chaney had serious personal problems, is a case of art imitating life, and the result is a kind of sad serendipity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>larry talbot should have run for President</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lon Chaney portrays psychological torment, guilt, and conflict so well in this film. These feelings are so absent in this century. Larry Talbot, in contrast to public officials and corporate executives, wants to do the right thing, and feels remorse at the suffering that he has caused. Chaney also does this in his later Inner Sanctum films. Maria Ouspenskaya is also great as Maleva, the gypsy. And the music is also marvelous. Films as these put contemporary horror films to shame. The former are fun and a pleasure to watch. This one is quite good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tragic Monster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wolf Man is a film about a man bitten by a werewolf condemned to live the life of his antagonist. Lon Chaney Jr. does an awfully good job transcending the traditional monster out to get everyone with a humane, sympathetic portrait of the titular lycanthrope. This is Universal Studios at its best with a good old-fashioned horror yarn, excellent acting, particularly by supporting cast members Claude Rains, Evelyn Ankers, Bela Lugosi, and the outstanding Maria Ouspenskaya as the old and wise gypsy woman, wonderful sets complete with swirling fog, and special effects that were new and fresh in 1941. This film is fast-paced and deserves its rank as one of the great Universal horror classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite Universal Monster Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't tell you how many times I have seen it but it has to be over 40. Lon Chaney Jr. gives his best performance (he even acknowledged that in an magazine interview once) and is sensational. Not only can he act but he can act with a vengeance. Claude Rains is his loving and sympathetic yet as he puts it himself a stiff necked and demonstrative father who wants to protect his son from well, himself. Evelyn Ankers is outrageously beautiful and captivating. Chaney and her bond like crazy glue to your finger. And the funny thing is they despised each other in real life just like Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland did off the set of Robin Hood. It shows you that in those days actors and actresses really had to ACT. Chaney convinces you he loves this woman but cannot bear the unbearable burden of being cursed and damned to eternal life. Only 90 minutes long but there is enough there to thrill you and it was one of Hollywood's best horror films many consider it to be the best classic horror film ever made. I would say I would have to agree with them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Werewolf as we know it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Universal Studios had an impressive list of successes in the horror genre starting in 1931 with Tod Browning's "Dracula". The myth of the werewolf, was firstly adapted in 1935 in "Werewolf of London", but the movie failed to get the public's attention in the same way as the "Dracula" and "Frankenstein" series of movies. However, the moon shined for the wolf in 1941, when a second attempt was done with a completely new story. "The Wolf Man" had a great reception and soon was considered among the finest of the Universal Studios' movies of that era and it is probably the last of the Classics as the horror movies of the 40s started to have lower budget and production values."The Wolf Man" is a classic tragedy where a man becomes a beast that must kill every time the full moon shines on the sky. Lon Chaney Jr. is Larry Talbot, who returns home to Wales after spending years in the U.S.. Not only he'll have to adapt to the life in countryside and improve his relationship with his father (Claude Rains); now he'll face the curse of the werewolf after been bitten by the gypsy Bela (Bela Lugosi).I have always thought that the previous "Werewolf of London" was a vastly superior film in terms of acting, direction and even make-up; however, the film's plot is not captivating and in the end not very attractive. On the other hand, Curt Siodmack's script for "The Wolf Man" is a brilliant masterpiece of horror and fantasy. So perfect that it makes up for all the film's other flaws, as it has an unnatural charm that is simply mesmerizing.Like a Greek tragedy, the saga of Larry Talbot and his curse works in so many levels that is no surprise that it is the film that not only type-casted Chaney, but also serve as basis for all the future werewolf films. Siodmack basically creates the Werewolf myths out of thin air and gives them form with masterful care. Who can forget Maleva's (Maria Ouspenskaya) words? The "Wolf Man" rhyme is now one of the most famous quotes in film history.Claude Rains is superb as Sir John Talbot, and gives the role the dignity that requires. Probably Lon Chaney Jr. had a limited range as an actor, but he was the perfect Larry Talbot with his sad looks and overall tragic appearance. Against all odds, Chaney embodied the wolf man and made the part almost mythical. The rest of the cast was definitely not as convincing as those great actors; however, Maria Ouspenskaya and Bela Lugosi are terrific as the gypsies who will play an important part in Talbot's future.Jack Pierce's make-up is definitely the other star in this movie. The legendary monster maker created a piece that is now considered legendary. The wolf man's make-up is more beast-like and primal than the subtle one that Henry Hull used in "Werewolf of London", but that is because both werewolves are very different between them. While Hull's character was the darkest side of his persona, Chaney's wolf man is a beast that posses his body, and Jack Pierce captured that essence with the limited technology of his time, creating an immortal masterpiece in make-up history."The Wolf Man" may not be a perfect film, but the captivating storyline and the mystique surrounding it definitely have earned this movie a huge reputation as one of the best of the Universal Studios films of the 30s-40s era. While there may be better werewolf movies out there, this one will always be remembered as THE definitive werewolf classic. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The wolf man is the beast or Freudian "Id" in all of us -- the part of us we don't want others to see, the part of us we may not even want to see ourselves.Lon Chaney, Jr., gives a touching and sympathetic performance depicting his struggle with the monster within him. Some critics were snide, pointing out that he came across too much like Lenny in OF MICE AND MEN, but to say that is to miss the sense of pathos he brings to his part.The rest of the cast is an interesting mix of character actors, including Bela Lugosi who has a small but important part and Maria Ouspenskaya who recites the werewolf verses with such conviction as to make you think they are true.This film is a fable about us all. We all have a spilt personality that can overtake us if we are not careful to know ourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moody Tragic Werewolf Legend - A Universal Horror Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Larry Talbot, a prodigal son, returns to his father's country estate. Following a visit with a friend to a gypsy fortune-teller, he is bitten by a werewolf and cursed to become one himself. Confused, frightened and unsure of what is happening to him, tragedy awaits ...The Wolf Man is a classic Universal horror movie, every bit as influential as Dracula or Frankenstein, with a great gloomy script by Curt Siodmak and memorable performances from Chaney, the gorgeous Ankers, Lugosi and especially Ouspenskaya. Although it is predated by another film (Stuart Walker's 1935 Werewolf Of London), it pretty much invented the cinematic werewolf legend, which for me has always been one of horror's most interesting themes, both visually in terms of special effects and tricks and emotionally - the duality of man, only with scares. The movie works wonderfully on both levels; it's full of terrific moody fog-filled sets and shadows and Jack Pierce's famous makeup job on Chaney is tremendous, but it also deals with the tragedy on a grand Shakespearian level - Larry is doomed from the moment he is bitten and is as much an empathetic victim as a prowling monster. The film spawned three direct sequels and has influenced literally hundreds of horror films since (particularly An American Werewolf In London). A great old scary movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All things to make this an horror classic are present here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror films mainly in the '30's and 40's needed 3 good things to make it a successful one. A good story, a good 'monster' and good actors. "The Wolf Man" truly is a movie that has all those ingredients present."The Wolf Man" is written by one of the best writers of the genre in that period; Curt Siodmak. It also has the 'luck' that it stars Claude Rains, Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney Jr. Three of the biggest names of that period. Let's face it people, Lon Chaney Jr. isn't that much good of an actor but he still is some sort of an icon with a kind of cult status which makes him extremely good for playing 'monster' parts in movies like this. Lugosi's role is extremely limited and in the few scene's he's in he's terribly overacting. Fans of him will be terrible disappointing by this. Also a legendary person in this is Maria Ouspenskaya. She might not be terribly legendary as an actress but she surely is as an acting teacher. One of her students was Lee Strasberg who later became the teacher of actors such as Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. He is probably still best know for portraying Hyman Roth in "The Godfather Part II" for which he also received an Oscar nomination but lost to his own protégé De Niro (Also for "The Godfather Part II".). Another protégé of her was Stella Adler who became the mentor of Marlon Brando. This all to just indicate how legendary Maria Ouspenskaya was.As for this movie itself; it has a fantastic atmosphere and simple but very effective story with some nice moments in it. The Wolf Man himself has grown into one of the legendary movie monsters and this is the one role that Lon Chaney Jr. will always be remembered for. He later reprise his role as Larry Talbot/Wolf Man in "Bud Abbott Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein", "House of Dracula", "Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man" and "House of Frankenstein".For the fans of classic horror movies this is a must see. Most other 'normal' people will probably just shrug while watching this movie but they should still be able to appreciate the atmosphere and the fine actors and story.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Out of Universal Pictures comes The Wolf Man, directed by George Waggner and written by Curt Siodmak. It stars Lon Chaney Jr, Claude Rains, Warren William, Ralph Bellamy, Bela Lugosi, Patric Knowles, Maria Ouspenskaya &amp; Evelyn Ankers."Even a man who is pure in heart-and says his prayers by night-may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms-and the autumn moon is bright"Larry Talbot (Chaney) returns to his ancestral home in Britain after learning of the death of his brother. Looking to solidify his relationship with his father, Sir John (Rains), Larry also starts to fall for local antique shop girl Gwen Conliffe (Ankers). While purchasing a silver wolf headed walking stick from her he hears of the werewolf legend; about how a man turns into a wolf at certain times of the year. Later that night Larry takes Gwen and her friend Jenny (Fay Helm) to a gypsy f?te out in the countryside, from where Jenny then gets separated from the other two and is attacked by a wolf. Hearing her cries Larry comes to her aid and kills the animal, but during the m?lée he was bitten and soon he finds that the legend of the werewolf is not merely hearsay.In 1935 Universal Pictures were still on a crest of a wave with their forays into horror. However, their release of Werewolf Of London was met with poor box office returns and critical indifference. Rightly seen as a fine film now, it was back then deemed too similar to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931 Paramount Pictures) and some way away from the tone of Frankenstein, Dracula &amp; The Mummy. It seemed that there was no cinematic life in some poor lycanthrope. Forward 6 years then, and springing from the brain of Curt Siodmak (Wolf Man has no direct literary source), a legacy was about to be born.The Wolf Man, the character, in the pantheon of Univeral Monsters, is as iconic as his stable mates who blazed the trail 10 years previously. The film itself is a classic of sorts, but a long way from being a truly great movie. Good? Yes of course. Just not as awe inspiring as the legacy would have us believe. Waggner's movie is shot on a B movie budget, with himself only being a modest studio director: lets be honest here, he wasn't, for example, fit to shine the boots of Messrs Whale &amp; Browning. His direction is competent here but devoid of any visual flourishes or boldness of vision. There's also many flaws to be found on revisits, not just the continuity errors that scream out that a rush edit happened, but also in instances within the story. Notably; we are first asked to believe that the small in stature Claude Rains has sired the oak like Lon Chaney; then the big question of how come when Lugosi's wolf attacks Jenny, it is actually a wolf, but Chaney's is actually a wolf-man? Yes indeed.But The Wolf Man is adored by many in spite of its flaws. And not just by people like me, who after viewing the film as a child was too scared to look out into the garden at nighttime for fear of some hirsute beastie coming to get me! As noted, the budget was B level, but there's nothing B level about the cast here. Rains, Bellamy &amp; Ouspenskaya were class acts. Lugosi = respect and Chaney, with his slick transformation from amiable gent to tortured soul, put a marker down in horror cinema that is still remembered fondly today. The sets too belie the budget; where the Universal crew come up with a Gothic cobblestoned village, bordered by a moonlit and misty forest, where the gloom is only punctured by the glow of shotgun bearing villagers flaming torches. Now that's classic Universal alright, atmosphere goes a long way, and The Wolf Man has it in spades. Credit too has to go to Siodmak, two fold in fact. Most tellingly on why we forgive Wolf Man its problems is that the story is such a good one, so good in fact that most of it has been believed to be based on archetypal legend. Then there's the fact that our protagonist here is an average Joe, not an ignorant scientist or a cursed creature with dodgy family ties, an affable guy who whilst committing an act of bravery is doomed for his trouble. It's a nice veer from the norm of Universal Monsters.Also impressive is the makeup by Jack Pierce and the lap dissolve effects by John P. Fulton. Dated now for sure, but the artistry shown by these guys back then is nothing short of amazing. Another point of reference to Chaney's eagerness to deliver was that he went all in for Pierce to work his magic. Henry Hull in Werewolf Of London six years earlier refused to succumb to the full makeup treatment. Chaney did, and immortality was secured as he turned into a horror star overnight. The Wolf Man was a big hit with audiences, so much so that the character would appear in 4 further movies as part of a creature feature ensembles (House Of Frankenstein et al); with Chaney playing him/it every time. Odd that such an iconic monster never actually had his own sequel really! Just one of the many strange and interesting things attached to this flawed but truly enjoyable movie. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May be the greatest Universal horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the realm of Universal's horror library, Dracula and Frankenstein have a special place as the most famous films, and Bride of Frankenstein has a special place in the hearts of the film buffs, and other films of this type get pushed back and basically forgotten. The Wolf Man is very famous for its image of the werewolf, plus it invented the entire silver bullet part of the myth (although no silver bullets were ever fired in the film), but as a film itself, it is not well remembered and is not considered a staple as much as the three aforementioned films. I think this is a great mistake. Dracula and Frankenstein are very famous films, but neither are great as films. Bride of Frankenstein is a great film, but it is maybe not as artistically well made as some people would like to think. The Wolf Man is, however, a masterfully made film. Unlike the many later installments of Universal's horror franchise, The Wolf Man aspires to be more than just another movie to consume and then forget ten minutes later. It is a very complex and literate film, and deserves a greater reputation than it has. There are plenty of one dimensional supporting characters in this film. The love interest is not a great actress, and her character is quite slim in character. The gypsy woman who appears once in a while is just a gross stereotype, and is not very interesting (she works more like a normal plot device). And the police could have been lifted from any other film. But there are a few great performances in this film. Claude Raines is excellent as the father. Bela Lagosi, who of course played Dracula a decade before The Wolf Man, proves that he is a versatile actor. He is only in the film for a few moments, but his character is developed psychologically. And then we have Lon Chaney Jr. I have heard him called a block of wood before. I don't know if people who claim that have seen this film. He really does create a very complex character. In fact, I'd say that this film is so successful because of him. Unfortunately, in Hollywood, almost all leading men are of the handsome breed. It's always as if Hollywood lives in a fantasy world where everyone is beautiful. Apparently they hired Chaney Jr. because of his father, the Man with the Thousand Faces. Chaney Jr. is not handsome at all. And he is not smooth or charming. He seems like a perpetual loser. Heck, he meets up with the love interest because he saw through her window with a telescope! This works perfectly for this film, and it turns out to be a very nearly perfect movie. The only fault is that it may end too abruptly, although the ending does not give us closure. There are still things to be discussed after in ends. 10/10</fullReview>

(Yes, Chaney's American, but the movie explains this, awkwardly.) Bitten by a werewolf, Talbot suffers the classic fate of all victims of lycanthropy. This is a classy horror outing, with strong atmosphere and a thoughtful script by Curt Siodmak-- well, except for the stiff romantic bits between Chaney and Evelyn Ankers. It's also got Bela Lugosi, briefly, and Maria Ouspenskaya, the prune-like Russian actress who foretells doom like nobody's business.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS MOVIE DID SCARE ME</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was ten when I saw this movie, and this is the only movie that has really scared me. The first time I saw the Wolf Man in full make-up, zip, I pulled the pillow over my head (I was on my bed). My father was watching with me and laughed (he saw this brand new in 1941). "Did I want it turned off?" I peeked out and, "No" everything was fine now. I finished my first viewing with awe at the make-up and transformations. I had seen other horror movies, dozens at that point, but, this was the first that had genuinely scared me. And thus began my love affair with the Wolf Man. Good music, creepy sets, good pacing, excellent cast and acting, believable storyline, transformations and make-up that DIDN'T have, or rely on, a computer to make them look good. Yes, computers have enhanced our viewing pleasures with better special effects, but, have they really replaced the Wolf Man's work, or for that fact, have they really replaced Willis O'Brien's work on King Kong. I own both, love both, and have viewed both at least a hundred time (seriously). If you want gore, blood and splatter, check else where. If you want class and quality, you can't get much better than The Wolf Man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You think I don't know the difference between a wolf and a man?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wolf Man is one of the most iconic figures of horror. Volumes have been written on Lon Chaney's Larry Talbot, so there's not much more for me to add. I'll just say that I find Talbot's attitude toward his fate in The Wolf Man refreshing. It's not until the later sequels that I find Talbot's continued and repeated bemoaning of his condition tiresome. Unlike other movie "monsters", he doesn't desire or relish the idea of killing. Just compare Talbot with some of the other movie "monsters" of the period. Take Dracula for instance. He relished the idea of drinking blood and had absolutely no qualms about killing. Dr. Frankenstein, while a tragic figure in his own right, was responsible for his fate and knew exactly what he was doing. Karloff's I'm-Ho-Tep is a being that doesn't mind committing murder to get what he wants. In comparison, Talbot is a victim and a very tragic character. It makes the character more human and, therefore, easier to feel sympathy for.The cast of The Wolf Man may actually be one of the best that Universal ever assembled. The acting is first-rate. In fact, the iconic Chaney may be the weak link. Evelyn Ankers is solid as the target of Talbot's affection. Maria Ouspenskaya steals every scene in which she appears with her understated performance. Claude Rains was a four-time Oscar-nominated actor. Bela Lugosi gives a nice, although too brief, performance as the gypsy, Bela. Few movies, horror or otherwise, can boast of a cast like this.Finally, I just love these older movies and their non-CGI effects. It took real makeup and camera craftsmen to change Chaney into a werewolf. The stop motion transformation is almost as effective today as it was in 1941. And, there's a reason Jack Pierce's makeup from The Wolf Man is so well known ? it works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Definitive Werewolf Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't praise this movie highly enough, it is not only the best of the universal monsters series and one of the greatest werewolf films ever made certainly the definitive treatment, but also one of my all time favourite movies. Lon Chaney turns in an outstanding credible performance worthy of his father the legendary man of a thousand faces, actually the entire cast is outstanding, Claude Rains, Maria Ouspenskaya and Bela Lugosi.The script by Curt Siodmak is marvellous, borrowing from genuine werewolf folklore and adding its own. The plot device of having the werewolf see the pentagram on the palm of it's next victim is truly ingenious and I don't know why it was never utilised in any of the sequels or any other werewolf films for that matter.The score by Frank Skinner and Han J Salter is so haunting, and has a nice rich romantic sound to it, especially the cues used in the gypsy camp, if only The Wolf Man weren't a b movie it probably would have won an Oscar.Lastly it must be said that Jack Pierce's make up and John P Faulton's werewolf transformations really go along way in making this film, who could ever forget the image of the wolf man walking through the fog shrouded forest in search of fresh victims.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best, under-appreciated horror movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>10/20/2005WARNING! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS! IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE, PLEASE DON'T READ IT!Still with me? Good.Many people I know say that, of the classic Universal monster movies, that movies such as Bela Lugosi's "Dracula", the original Boris Karloff "Frankenstein" and "Bride of Frankenstein" are the best of the classic monster movies. I must politely say that they're missing out one of the best horror movies from the 1940s: "The Wolf Man".The story seems simple enough: after being away in California for eighteen years, Larry Talbot (the great Lon Chaney Jr.) returns home to learn to eventually take over the family estate, currently handled by his father Sir John (Claude Rains). While back in his hometown, Larry falls for Gwen Conliffe (Evelyn Ankers), the daughter of a shop owner and engaged to a member of Talbot's estate, Frank Andrews (Patrick Knowles). After buying a silver-topped walking cane from Gwen in the shop, Larry accompanies her and her friend Jenny (Fay Helm) to get their fortunes told by a band of visiting Gypsies.Unfortunately, the fortune teller Bela (Lugosi) turns into a werewolf, murders Jenny and attacks Larry when he comes to help. Larry is bitten by the wolf before he kills it, only to have his wound heal the next morning and learn he's suspected of killing Bela with his cane by the police the next morning. While attending a festival the night after Bela's funeral, Bela's mother Maleva (Maria Ouspenskaya) warns him he's been given the curse of the werewolf by her late son's bite and gives Larry a silver pentagram charm to keep from changing into the beast within him. Larry instead gives the charm to Gwen to keep her safe, but when the moon rises, Larry changes into the Wolf Man and starts murdering any who comes in his path. But when Gwen is his next target, Larry must find a way to get away to keep from hurting those he loves - which may just cost him his life.Of the pros, the cast works very well with their roles. While Lugosi, Ouspenskaya, Ankers and Rains highlight the supporting roles, it is - naturally - Chaney who gives the best performance. Unlike other monsters, Chaney's Talbot is kind-hearted man who turns into a creature against his will and happens to sever people's jugular veins by biting their necks. You gain sympathy for Talbot in the movie and his character became popular enough to be resurrected and appear in four other films following this.The writing is brilliant, balancing character development with the scares and chills the movie gives off. The sets work fairly well and the musical score (done by the uncredited team of Charles Previn, Hans Salter and Frank Skinner) works well, setting the right moods for the scenes. The music is often beautiful, including a nice pulsing sound like a musical heartbeat when Larry first finds himself changing into a wolf, or heartbreaking, such as the theme heard when Maleva visits Bela at his coffin or when Sir John learns the identity of the wolf he's stopped.On the negative side, though, we get some rather puzzling aspects. If Maleva had a charm to keep a person from becoming a werewolf, why didn't she give it to her own son Bela? Or, if she got it later, when and did she get it? Why does Bela even meet Jenny and tell her fortune shortly before he becomes a werewolf? How exactly did Maleva know how to return Larry from a werewolf back to human for a short time when she finds the Wolf Man and, again, not do it to Bela? And how do werewolves manage to dress themselves, anyway? Larry, wears an undershirt when he changes into a werewolf, but suddenly is wearing a dark shirt when he first becomes the Wolf Man. Oy.Still, despite the flaws, "The Wolf Man" is one of the best horror movies, or movies in general, that Universal has ever done. It may not be a perfect movie, but it's a certainly excellent nevertheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lon Chaney, Jr. You'll love him, even as the monster.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite of all the Universal horrors. Even in 1941, this is not the original werewolf movie. It was already a remake, even at this early date. However, it is by far, the best of the older werewolf movies; the progenitor which has spawned nearly all other movies of this line. It lays down the basic laws concerning werewolves, gives you a history of lycanthropy, and leaves the rest to your imagination. While the effects left a lot to be desired, they are forgiven due to the incredible age of this classic masterpiece.Lon Chaney was the veritable epitome of lovable; honorable, sweet, and intelligent Americanized man, who is open and endearing, lending these qualities to his character, and making you love him, even as he becomes this horrible, monstrous killer."Through no fault of your own.."This movie is more than a classic. It is an absolute masterpiece of drama, horror, legend, and melancholy sweetness. This was one of the Universal horror classics which shaped the whole genre of horror as we know it.I highly recommend Universal's The Wolf Man Legacy Collection DVD Box set. It is WELL worth the asking price.It rates a 9.5/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's a Bite for You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever I see this movie, I am amazed that it seems so sad. Poor Larry Talbot "Lon Chaney, Jr" never asked to be a werewolf, he was just trying to fight off a wolf that happen to bite him. Little did he know that "Bela, played by Bela Lugosi" was a werewolf, how could something like this happen to a man? The only other person that believes Larry Talbot is a werewolf is Bela's mother, the old gypsy woman, Maleva, so wonderfully played by Maria Ouspenskaya. She tells him the old gypsy saying of "even a man that says his prayers...." which Larry won't believe, because it is a curse for life. You also feel so sad when Sir John Talbot played by Claude Rains ends up killing his own son with the Silver Wolf's Head cane. Sir John kept telling Larry that it was all part of his mental state, caused by that old gypsy woman. A movie monster classic that will live on in video, DVD, and late night TV. Just as a werewolf continues to live on, so will the memory of Lon Chaney's great role of a wolf!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Errie shadows follow the second Talbot son(the broad shouldered giant of a seemingly much younger and smaller Father) as he strides through the woods with the beautiful Gwen to the gypsy camp to have his fortune told. The obviously constant fog swirls around everybody's ankles in the darkness. Lon's two standard expressions, his stiff smile while with Gwen and his wide eyed look of anxiety as he transforms into the hairy beast alternate throughout the film. There is an unforgettable moment as the hairs sprout and Lon's expression clearly says -Oh no, I'm a werewolf ! ! The plot is barely plausible but the strength of this film lies not in the characters but in the portrayal of them by the wooden actors of which Lon is the best. The cream of B-movie actors, Bela Lugosi as - Bela - treats us to a flash of his abundant eyebrows in a brief appearance while the monotonous drone of the gypsy woman as she endlessly repeats sayings about the werewolf is only equalled by her bang on time arrival with horse and carriage as the wolf attacks his victim. Even the beautiful Gwen doesn't bat an eyelid at the news of her best friends murder. A classic to be watched as many times as possible - it only gets better !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Even a man who is pure in heart and says his prayers by night may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright." - A poem recited all too often in The Wolf ManThe Wolf Man is the darkest Universal monster film thus far, dealing with heavy subject matter such as man vs. superstition, the lost of individualism, and the dark, spiritual transformation from a man into a creature of the night. Such traits also make it one of the best monster films Universal churned out. The film is almost a werewolf in itself: creepy, unpredictable, difficult to define, often beautiful and misunderstood, and hard to forget.The film stars Lon Chaney Jr. in the career-making performance of Larry Talbot, who experiences a strange transformation cycle after being bit by a werewolf while defending a woman during an attack. The film begins with Talbot returning home to Llanwelly, Wales to reconnect with his estranged father (Claude Rains). Larry then meets Gwen (Evelyn Ankers), a beautiful woman who runs a local antique shop. In the process of getting to know her, he impulsively buys a silver-headed walking stick, which is said to represent the almighty werewolf.After rescuing Gwen's friend from a late night wolf attack, which, as stated, led to him being bit, he talks with a gypsy fortuneteller (Maria Ouspenskaya), who states the person who bit him was her son (Bela Lugosi of Universal's earliest monster movie Dracula from 1931) in wolf form. With this realization in mind, Larry is informed he will soon turn into a werewolf, to live a dual life between man and superstition.From the first frame of the film, you know what your in for with The Wolf Man. A film of many gripping scenes of suspense, careful performances, and beautiful makeup effects done by industry legend Jack Pierce. Consider Larry's transition from man to monster. The scene lasts mere seconds, but makeup-application and costume fitting took roughly ten hours to complete. The transition looks easy, but as always, the process was one of rigor and painstaking craft.Lon Chaney Jr.'s terrifically straight-laced performance only elevates the believability of the film. Despite the strangeness of the concept, particularly at the time, Chaney Jr. chooses to assume a personality of seriousness and one predicated off of subtleties. It's easily one of the best performances in Universal's lengthy line of monster flicks, and deserves a mention alongside Karloff's Frankenstein and Lugosi's suave Dracula.In addition, this is one of the few Universal monster films not directed by James Whale, but rather, George Waggner, who went on to direct Universal's color adaption of Phantom of the Opera just two years after the release of The Wolf Man. While I was consistently wowed by Whale's inclusion of massive and detailed sets and his infusion of wit to his material, I doubt he could've made The Wolf Man as well as Waggner. Waggner is concerned with atmosphere and tone, two things that weren't always in the forefront in American cinema. The Wolf Man serves as another film that makes it difficult to decide which monster film I enjoy the best.Starring: Lon Chaney Jr., Claude Rains, Evelyn Ankers, and Maria Ouspenskaya. Directed by: George Waggner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the greatest horror film ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wolf Man", while signaling the end of the classic Universal horrors, is in and of itself their greatest triumph.Much of the Werewolf lore taken as fact by the general public in fact was the invention of the screenwriter, the very talented Curt Siodmak, and has very little, if any, basis in true folklore. Not bad for an immigrant from Nazi Germany, Mr. Siodmak had said that much of the "horror" in the film was derived from the horrors he witnessed in his homeland before emigrating to the USA.Contrary to other reviews, the very talented Lon Chaney Jr. gives a performance as the cursed Larry Talbot equal to or superior to his role of Lenny in "Of Mice and Men". The scenes between he and Claude Rains, portraying his father, Sir John Talbot, are given real emotional heft by the two actors, even though I've never known a father and son who discuss their being "stiff-necked and undemonstrative types" who vow never to have any more such reserve with only a handshake. The later scenes clearly show Chaney playing Talbot as a man who thinks he's going nuts, while his father (being stiff-necked and undemonstrative) grasps at straws to help him fight his demons.The supporting players are just as luminous, especially Evelyn Ankers (Ankers Away!!) as Gwen Conliffe, the proprietor of the antique shop who is engaged, but who falls for Larry just the same. Bela Lugosi, being thrown a crumb at Universal after starting the horror cycle with "Dracula" in 1931, plays Bela the Gypsy Fortune Teller, the one who visits the curse upon our Larry. Mme. Maria Ouspenskaya portrays Bela's mother, Maleva, who schools Larry and the viewers about werewolves, and becomes a self-appointed look-out for the man turned beast (a role she no doubt played for her own son). Ralph Bellamy as Col. Montford plays the role as if he's in the Talbots' pockets, nonetheless is dashing enough in the role of the local constable. Bits by Warren William as Dr. Lloyd and by Patric Knowles as Frank Andrews, Gwen's fiancée, add to the horrific festivities.The film only runs 70 minutes, but contains more intelligence, wit, and downright chills than any 10 so-called "horror" films made in the last 30 years."The Wolf Man" is a film to be savored over and over again, even by men who are pure in heart, and say their prayers by night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lon Chaney Jr. is a pleasant surprise.The Wolf Man is one of those classic horror movies you watch in October expecting some campy fun.To my surprise however, I discovered good dialogue, decent directing and 1st class acting to take it all home.We expect this from Claude Rains of Casablanca fame, but the biggest surprise for me is the performance from Lon Chaney Jr. I'm still new to watching older films, and although I knew of his body of work, I had never seen one of his movies. After watching, I really thought he could have been the leading man in a serious film. His portrayal as the easy-go-lucky and likable Larry Talbout contrasts perfectly his later torn and desperate portrayal of man afraid of himself and worried about what he could do to the ones he cares about.I recommend it as a Halloween/horror classic for anyone's collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course the Universal Horrors aren't scary by today's standards, but all the indifferent critiques from these "too young to appreciate" reviewers on this site certainly horrify!THE WOLF MAN will always be the definitive werewolf film. Its strengths are due to a number of things: the heartbreaking performance from Lon Chaney, the creepy and misty and moody forests, the awesome makeup from creative wiz Jack Pierce, the robust music score from Hans Salter, and the overwhelming sense of mythology and legend that flows throughout the whole story.I pity younger viewers today (as I say so often) who are incapable (perhaps through no fault of their own) to drown themselves in such masterworks like this! Sorry, kids, you won't find any pathetic humor (like in AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON) here, nor will you see over-the-top werewolves oozing about (like in THE HOWLING). But what you WILL find (if you can endure the glorious black and white photography in this day of MTV and CGI overkill) is a very good classic that your negative reviews can never change!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Whoever is bitten by a werewolf and lives becomes a werewolf himself."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Could there be a better movie to watch on Halloween Eve, other than the original "Dracula" perhaps? Lon Chaney Jr.'s portrayal as "The Wolf Man" earns him iconic status along with Universal's "Frankenstein" and the aforementioned role made famous by Bela Lugosi. Lugosi is present here as a gypsy fortune teller named Bela, with the forced diction of his earlier portrayal nearly gone.With a brief introduction to the subject of lycanthropy, or "werewolfism", the story unfolds with wonderfully creepy fog enshrouded sets and logic defying werewolf history that almost makes sense within the context of the story. Bitten by a werewolf, the anguished Larry Talbot (Chaney) struggles with the knowledge and curse of becoming a werewolf himself, though others of saner persuasion continually enforce their doubts of the ancient gypsy curse, repeated with regularity throughout the film.As if to counterpoint the mental illness of lycanthropy, take note of the name on the store front next to Conliffe's Antique Shop, it's called Saneman Productions Ltd. Perhaps Talbot could have used their help! "The Wolf Man" belongs on every horror fan's must see list; it's story holds up well, along with the special effects that are obviously primitive by today's standards. Even so, the story of a man who turns into a werewolf as one of cinema's great horror themes gets it's best screen history send off in this classic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable (if flawed) film with good atmosphere, but you need to meet it on its terms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The death of his brother brings Larry Talbot back to his family home, Talbot Castle, and reunites him with his father, Sir John Talbot. Spying a young woman through his telescope, Larry goes into town and meets Gwen Conliffe, who engages him with talk of legend and werewolves. Later that night they go together to visit a gypsy fortune-teller and slip off into the seclusion of the woods, leaving their friend with Bela ? the gypsy. Screams draw Larry to find her being attacked by a wolf, which he attacks but is badly hurt. The police find no wolf but do find Bela with his head caved in and no bite marks on Larry to back up his story. Suspicions and rumours are rife in the village about Larry being a murderer but Larry still believes the wolf was to blame ? but doesn't buy the gypsy line that Bela was the wolf; that is, until he starts to get hairy feet one night.First of all, to all the people moaning about how this is 'not scary' let me just say get over it. How could this film still have the same effect on audiences today as it did back then ? our effects are much better and we have also seen many spoofs on the wolf man carried out by everyone from Abbot &amp; Costello to Michael J. Fox's Teenwolf. However the film still manages to have a great atmosphere that does make it feel a bit creepy ? which is all I was really looking for. Having recently watched The Old Dark House, I was pleased to find that the Wolf Man actually had a narrative to speak of and, despite the familiarity of the tale, I was still into the telling and enjoyed it. It is a simple affair but it is well told ? even the romance is used to add to the story as opposed to being the lazy add-on it usually is.Waggner's direction is good ? even making the spacious woods feel tight and foreboding. Yes the werewolf looks a bit like a tall Ewok but this was over 60 years ago and I'm big enough to get past that problem. In fact I don't really have a major problem with this film because it did everything that I expected it to. Yes, it was clunky and obvious; yes, the wolf was a man in a suit and no, it didn't actually scare me; but it was still an enjoyable story nonetheless. The acting is mixed though. Rains is really good and he adds class to even his average dialogue. Chaney Jr though is not as good. His opening scenes are heavily delivered as if he was reading off a card but he does get better as he goes along. Bela Lugosi is, well, Bela Lugosi and he still overdoes the physical stuff like he always did even if he only has a few scenes here ? it is unmistakably him. The rest of the cast do OK but really the narrative is carried by these three (and a good Ankers) and they do well enough for this sort of film.Overall I enjoyed the film but am not blind to its weaknesses. It is not a horror as we would class them today, but it is still an atmospheric film that is effectively creepy ? not so much in the wolf himself but more in the build up of the story. The acting is OK even if the script often leaves much to be desired, but at least the overall story is good. Yes, it has dated but it is still worth seeing and is an enjoyable film if you meet it on its terms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A werewolf movie that's a lot more intellectual than you might expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some serious flaws in Universal Studios' "The Wolf Man" but it's an enjoyable film whose influence still lasts to this day. The film stars Lon Chaney, Jr. As Larry Talbot. He returns to his ancestral home in Llanwelly, Wales after learning of his brother's death. Larry and his estranged father do not get along very well and it's quite the grim visit. Things take a turn for the better though when he notices the beautiful Gwen Conliffe (Evelyn Ankers). When Larry is attacked by a wolf, he manages to fight it off but the creature has made it's mark. Having sustained a bite from the beast, Larry soon begins transforming into a werewolf at night.The biggest problem with the movie is that it features numerous continuity and editing errors. There are scenes where doors are opened twice or objects moved twice, scenes Larry's clothing changes between him being a man and being fully transformed and the inexplicable biggie: why is it that the first wolf man we see took on the appearance of a wolf but Larry turns into a wolf-man hybrid? One or two mistakes you can overlook as just simple gaffes but there are a lot of these and other strange inconsistencies in the film that are genuinely distracting. Because of everything that's actually really good in the movie these mistakes are particularly disappointing. It could have been a great film if the script had been polished up a bit and the editing had been better.This movie would have been forgotten as a film trying to ride on the coat tails of "Dracula" and "Frankenstein" if it hadn't been for the protagonist Larry and the aspect of the werewolf curse. He's a sympathetic character that comes to a strange place and is taken aback by the town's weird obsession with werewolf legends (a legend that prior to the film was not very well known to American audiences). He's a charmer and when he gets afflicted with the werewolf curse (more on that in a second) you really see and feel the internal conflict he's faced with. Our character is literally and figuratively afflicted with a curse. The town's people do not know that it is only a matter of time before he turns into a raging beast and attacks but they still ostracize Larry because of a tragedy that happened while he was out with a young woman on the night he was bitten. The girl's mother blames him for what happened. Her logic is that Larry had no business taking out a woman who is engaged to be married in the first place (She has a point) and that he is the reason her daughter was out that night. He's already shunned by the town, but it gets worse. Half the people that surround him think that Larry's gone mad. Once that wolf that attacked him died, it reverted back to its normal, human form. Larry isn't really blamed for the death, it's ruled as accidental, but still. During the scuffle, they assume, Larry and the man exchanged a few unintentional blows with themselves as well as with the animal. He may be cleared of any wrongdoing as far as the law is concerned, but this doesn't mean that the people around him don't suspect his mental instability, not only because of the "accidental" death but also because of the psychological effect that the death has on Larry.All of this is purely from a coincidental aspect because in reality, Larry is genuinely cursed. Not only does he turn into a monster by moonlight but he also knows ahead of time who he will attack next. On top of being responsible for the murders, Larry also has the added pain of wanting to warn his would-be victim(s) but is unable to do so because everyone thinks he's basically nuts. While I always look to the transformation sequences as the highlight of any werewolf film, this whodunit aspect is a terrific element I wish was more present in these stories because the beast is able to blend in with the rest of us during the day and this film takes that idea and puts a whole new twist on it.The film is very iconic. The design of the wolf man is still recognizable over sixty years after the film's release and looks pretty good too. The film has some nice special effects with the transformation (though because this one predates a lot of modern effects they are kept to a minimum) and I love the atmospheric setting of the action. It's set in these terrific woodland sets full of mist. Even the script has its share of good quotes. The best is easily the poem that is repeated multiple times by the people of Llanwelly "Even a man who is pure in heart//and says his prayers by night//may become a wolf when the wolf bane blooms//and the autumn moon is bright." That's some good stuff right there. It's interesting too to see a werewolf movie that SURPRISE! does away with all of that nonsense about the full moon. A full moon never appears during this movie, Larry just transforms at night time.For its historical importance and the interesting drama present, I do recommend you see "The Wolf Man". The recommendation is stronger still if you are a fan of horror films and for lovers of the old Universal Monsters, it's an absolute must. Granted it has not aged as well as some of the other black-and-white horror films of the time and by today's film standards you're unlikely to get scared. It also has a lot of technical problems but there's a lot more good here than bad. You may believe you know all there is to know about this classic, but there's a lot more going on here than you think. (Theatrical version on DVD, November 2, 2013)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A monster movie with surprisingly little focus on the monster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wolf Man manages to tell an engaging monster movie story without showing too much of the actual monster, which allows for much greater character development than I anticipated before watching it. Instead of focusing on the wolf man itself, the focus is instead put on the internal struggle of the film's main protagonist, Larry Talbot. This internal conflict makes Larry a character that is easy to empathize with, as we all have had moments in our lives when we believe we see or hear something that in reality is nothing but a figment of our overactive imaginations. The scenes that do include the monster, although few and far between, are well done and feature impressive visual effects for he time. These elements combine to make a film that is both visually impressive and can keep your attention for its duration with engaging characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE WOLF MAN is considered a classic for a number of reasons, but paramount has to be the sympathetic portrayal by Lon Chaney, Jr. (Yes, the makeup by Jack Pierce is without peer, but it's the man behind the makeup who breathes Life into it.) Lugosi, in his "bit" part as the werewolf "Bela," actually manages to infuse his character with a touch of pathos, as well (for such a small part, Lugosi is extremely effective). As mentioned elsewhere, the one and only real gripe I have with this one is the continuity conundrum: when Chaney as Talbot first transforms into a werewolf, his CLOTHES change as well. Director George Waggner has to saddle the blame for that one, although everything else in the movie is handled beautifully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every monster must have it's origin. The importance of this monster to modern movies and those to come must make us appreciate it's origins. Regardless of how you feel about actors or plot when it comes to this picture, it deserves nothing less than a 10 for bringing forth into the silver screen the monster of all monsters. THE Wolf Man! Since then, the Wolf Man has stirred so many feelings, so many fears, so many movies. The Howling, Cursed, The Wolfen, An American Werewolf In London, Paris, etc.. It goes on and on and hopefully on. Out of all of the original monsters, Werewolves are number 1 for scaring the crap out of me. It all started right here with this very movie. I still can't watch it without feeling awestruck at how much this film has started and continued the fear of the Wolf Man. Even a man who is pure in heart and says his prayers by night may become a wolf when the wolfsbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid start for an underrated sub-genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies involving a part man, part creature stalking people in the night were a major event in the 1930s and 40s, and there was no shortage of them. Monsters of classic literature were brought to life on the big screen and moviegoers were both excited and terrified. Universal did it with Dracula, Frankenstein, and The Mummy in the early 30s, all of were given sequels over the next couple decades. But what about the half man, half beast? Yes he got his own movie too and it's a great one at that.Pros: Excellent performances. Beautiful, sharp cinematography. A good and effectively eerie score. A spooky, fog-filled atmosphere. Well-paced. Excellent make-up effects. Grand production design.Cons: Some aspects haven't aged well. Impact not likely as strong as it once was.Final thoughts: Having been raised on werewolf pictures like 'The Holwing' and 'An American Werewolf in London' I loved movies about them. However when I was a kid I avoided movies like this one for fear they would be too dull and dated, but eventually learned this was not so. Sure it may not be so scary now, but there's more too it than that. It's not just a bunch of cheap thrills and is perfect viewing on a dark and foggy night.My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>two tragic stories, not one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been said that the Wolf Man is tragic, but not a tragedy, since his fate was not his fault.It took me decades to realize that this is a classic tragedy, but about the father, not the son. In fact, it's the prototype of Greek tragedies: hubris leading to great loss. Though neighbors and son try to convince Sir John to send his son Larry away, Sir John insists he knows best and can overcome through sheer personal will.Pay special attention to two scenes, not noted in any commentaries I've read. First is the one where Sir John ties his son to a chair facing a window open to let the full moon shine in. As a kid, this struck me as a silly plot contrivance. As the pivotal point in a Greek tragedy, it's perfect. Particularly heartbreaking in that scene is when Larry insists that his father take the silver cane. The son knows full well that he is handing his own doom to his father, while his father is completely oblivious.The second key scene is that brief moment at the end when Sir John sees the wolf man return to his true form, the son he has just killed. Claude Rains stares for a moment at his son's body, then turns and looks in wide-eyed horror at that silver cane in his hand. Claude Rains conveys beautifully the lightning bolt of realization that his character suffers. You almost expect him to follow Oedipus and blind himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favourite Universal Monster movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a very big fan of the Universal Monster movies. I love pretty much all of the ones I've seen but this one is by far the best. Sure, by today's standards it would be extremely tame and seem very lame but it is far from it. The Wolf Man is the quintessential werewolf movie, it has a great atmosphere, the acting is surprisingly good and the special effects were decent for the early 40's. Lon Chaney was the best choice for The Wolf Man, he is an extremely big man and when he transforms you can see why audiences back then were terrified. The makeup (compared to An American Werewolf in London) is fairly bad but if you can not keep that frame of mind for a movie made in 1941, I was quite surprised at how realistic the effects were. Claude Rains is also excellent and Bela Lugosi makes an important cameo. The movie is atmospheric, George Waggner making great use of fog and the woods.This is up there with Universal horrors such as Bride of Frankenstein, Dracula and The Invisible Man.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a day and age as chock full of CGI bloated, cheesy and predictable horror films (and I use the word "horror" lightly when really the applicable term should be "vomit inducing gore-fest") it's quite refreshing to look back at the roots of such abysmal creations, and imagine how 1941 audiences must have felt when they first laid eyes and ears upon the spectacle of the Wolf Man. While to today's audiences, the special effects transformations from human to werewolf and makeup effects of the werewolf itself may look laughably dated, it is near impossible to watch this film without a glimmer of the genuine terror and surprise the film must have driven into the hearts of its more innocent original audiences. There remains next to no doubt that the Wolf Man is a highly enjoyable straightforward monster thriller, which, unlike most modern films, is unwilling to simply coast along on the novelty of its special effects, but also allots nearly the entire running time to character development, punctuated with bits of necessary monster mayhem in between. While some of the camera work may be clunky, with a few awkward transitions, the atmospheric tone to the film is superb, with lots of long shots of the iconic foggy woods at night, perfectly adding to the mood and stirring up some undeniable tension, even for jaded modern audiences. While the film could never be considered subtle, full of many highly contrived scenes or scenarios, the plot may stumble, but not the sense of fun. Clocking in at a tidy 70 minutes, most of which is ominous foreshadowing for the inevitable lupine transformation, the movie certainly accomplishes its purpose - to frighten and amaze its audiences in a somewhat intelligent and tasteful fashion.Lon Chaney Jr. in his signature role turns in a terrific performance as both the title creature and his human counterpart, Larry Talbot, perfectly essaying a character who is charming, disgruntled, terrified, and finally a monster, and hitting few wrong notes in terms of believability in the process. (his Wolf Man may fall a bit flat in terms of credibility these days, but a mighty effort nonetheless) While Claude Rains may not be very credible casting as Chaney's father, he is unquestionably a strong presence as the wealthy philanthropist too proud to take his son's condition seriously. Evelyn Ankers may be stuck in a stereotypical "damsel in distress" role, but she makes the most of it and turns out a luminous and amicable performance. Maria Ouspenskaya is wonderful as a wise gypsy, and Bela Lugosi is mostly wasted in a tiny cameo as her son. The supporting cast for the most part turn out generic but entertaining performances.All in all, for fans of classic horror, The Wolf Man should be considered a must see, if they have yet to do so. Yet even for more jaded or more expectant viewers, there is still much to enjoy here, whether it be Chaney's defining role, some bold and groundbreaking makeup and early special effects. In general, a wonderfully moody and atmospheric early horror thriller!-8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Universal Studios which was THE studio for developing Gothic horror films, after a run of Dracula and Frankenstein films and Mummy, developed a third franchise with the creation of the wolfman.Lon Chaney, Jr. finally stepping into the horror film tradition of his father is the protagonist here. Lawrence Talbot, second son of a titled English family, comes home to his father who is grieving over the death of his first son. After settling in, Chaney becomes involved with some gypsies and has occasion to kill a wolf who had killed a village girl.But that wolf was a werewolf and in his human form was Bela Lugosi. In the struggle Chaney is bitten and becomes a werewolf himself.Universal really assembled a top flight cast of players for this debut film of the wolf man series. Besides Chaney and Lugosi, Claude Rains, Warren William, Patric Knowles, Ralph Bellamy and Evelyn Ankers are in it. Of course the best of the lot is Maria Ouspenskaya as the old gypsy woman who is Lugosi's mother. Interesting that in a film with a United Kingdom setting only Knowles and Rains are British by background.Still its grand Gothic horror as we don't see today and as Universal was the master.</fullReview>

There, he meets and falls in love with the beautiful Gwen (Evelyn Ankers), and later escorts her to a local carnival where a gypsy fortune teller (Bela Lugosi) warns Gwen's friend Jenny (Fay Helm) of the dangers that await her. Later on, Jenny is murdered by a wolf and Larry is injured, and things get weird when Larry sees that after killing the wolf, it turns into the fortune teller. Things go from bad to worse when Larry becomes a wolf himself by night, preying on innocent victims.my thoughts: This is the film that made werewolf movies famous and launched Lon Chaney, Jr.'s career in horror films.

		<shortDescription>Classic Horror At It's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What famous horror classic, panned by reviewers upon its initial release in December of 1941, looks better and better every year? THE WOLF MAN, starring Claude Rains, Ralph Bellamy, Evelyn Ankers, and Lon Chaney Jr. as the hapless Larry Talbot.The story is a familiar one: Larry, the son of esteemed Sir John (Rains) returns home to Wales after many years in America, is bitten by a werewolf (well played by Bela Lugosi), and becomes a werewolf himself. What's extraordinary is the fact that the film can be so effective today.The biggest reason for this is the acting. Some classic films, pre-Actor's Studio, look pretty pathetic when it comes to realistic characterization. Not so THE WOLF MAN. Curt Siodmak's excellent screenplay (likened to a Greek Tragedy) provides a vehicle for the stars to be at their best, and, boy, do they shine: Rains a tower of strength as the proud father; Ankers hitting just the right note as the torn female lead; Maria Ouspenskaya as the Old Gypsey Woman whose words prefigure Larry's doom....But the standout is Lon Chaney Jr. A definite mixed-bag as an actor, he is perfect here--and this is a role calling for the use of all human emotions (unlike later Wolf Man films, where Talbot's head-pounding becomes monotonous). In fact, seeing THE WOLF MAN recently has convinced me that Chaney would have made the ideal screen Phillip Marlow (and I'm not forgetting Bogie)--big, tough, surly, yet charming when need be (a highlight early in WOLF MAN is Larry's attempts at flirting with Ankers; Chaney does the surprisingly playful dialogue with just the right touch). There's no doubt that his performance would merit accolades even today.This is not to say that there aren't problems in the film. The continuity is off in a number of places (Chany transforms into the Wolf Man at one point wearing a sleeveless undershirt; in the very next scene, he's wearing a neatly buttoned Dickey), and there's a scene or two that's completely inexplicable (e.g., why DOES the Wolf Man pass out when caught in that trap?)....But overall, the pace, lighting, cinematography, excellent musical score, and strong story propel the film through these rough spots, the 70-minute ride leaving the viewer wanting more. For these reasons, THE WOLF MAN is a classic.</fullReview>

"The Wolf man" is actually pretty gripping and even exciting in a way. The exquisite score, simple yet splendid story and the marvelous acting performances (of course especially charismatic Lon Chaney Jr.) are all great and they make the experience very interesting and enjoyable and it's not hard to understand why this looked scary in the 1940's world. The scenes that are supposed to be horrifying are the ones that from today's point of view look the most comical. Amusing fact that "The Wolf man" was an extremely frightening movie at the time of its release makes it even, shall we say "cuter".

		<shortDescription>Understandably a classic. Proof of Hollywood magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Halloween I got a special treat because my local theatre showed The Wolfman with The Mummy in a double feature...two classic films I had never seen. Ever since I became a fan of classic film its hard for me to find one I don't at the very least appreciate and The Wolfman is no exception. The film actually holds up very well for the most part considering its age and actually is presented like a very fascinating stage play. I think the Hammer horror films are amazing because they made them on such a small budget and use ambiance and mood to capture the imaginations of the audience and what they probably weren't accounting for was the fact that it still works 7 decades later!! The shadowy and foggy landscape, the bold characters with very little depth but a lot of charisma on screen, a simple but fun story and The Wolfman is also downright creepy making it a worthy horror film for any generation!! Now I won't say that its perfect. The acting is very cheesy and yet somehow works for this particular picture. If you stopped and really picked apart the film it wouldn't stand up to scrutiny because it was made so simply but for sheer entertainment, sit back and enjoy, because you most certainly will.This is the first film I have seen starring Lon Chaney. I knew the name and knew this role but had never seen him in action. I actually thought for some reason he was a small homely man and he's anything but. Actually Chaney is tall and handsome and almost has a Cary Grant look to him. He actually is very, very good in this part because you see his boyish ego in the beginning and you also see the fear he feels when he realizes what is happening to him. He takes this part seriously and really nails it. A legend in his own right and not to be outdone, Claude Rains is also very good as Chaney's father. I actually think his character could have been used more but he gets some very good scenes opposite Chaney and gives a very good performance. Evelyn Ankers is perfect for this type of film. It is easy to see why she was an original scream queen for Hammer. She is very, very cheesy. She's lovely to look at and she runs and screams and is incredibly melodramatic and it just seems to work for this particular genre of film. I didn't really care for her in the role but I understand her purpose. Her chemistry with Chaney was decent enough but any woman looking for a strong female lead, won't find it here. Jamie Lee Curtis she ain't when it comes to scream queens. The supporting cast are all decent and play their roles well. Most of the characters are very one dimensional but they are what they are. Bela Lugosi appears briefly in a cameo role, Maria Ouspenskaya is perfect and creepy as the mysterious gypsy woman who randomly appears throughout, Warren William, Ralph Bellamy and Patric Knowles all keep the story rolling.Films like this are easy to review in one sense. It doesn't matter what I can say about a movie like this, good or bad, because its already a classic. Movie lovers have kept this alive and well for decades and sometimes I completely understand why and sometimes I don't. In the case of The Wolf Man I was completely entertained and really enjoyed the story. The special effects actually hold up decently all things considered and the only thing I thought really looked dated and quite terrible was The Wolf Man's make-up itself. Despite it being an iconic character, the make-up is downright terrible and comedic but once again it is all part of the classic experience. If you're a fan of Hammer Horror or you're just starting out with classic films...this is where the horror genre truly began. If you look at it with the right perspective, you will fall in love with The Wolf Man. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director George 'The Ghost of Frankenstein' Waggoner and Curt 'The Invisible Man Returns' Siodmak teamed up to create this classic Universal Monster at a time when the genre was winding down with a series of B Movie sequels. Lon Chaney, Jr. stars as Lawrence Talbot (a role he would recreate in each wolf man adventure) who is bitten by a werewolf (played by Bela Lugosi) and soon finds himself tormented by supernatural forces when the wolfbane blooms...according to the famous werewolf curse poetically read by Maria Ouspenkaya as the gypsy Maleva. Jack Pierce who had won accolades for his unforgettable work designing make ups for Frankenstein and The Mummy astonished audiences in 1941 with his time lapse transformation of man into werewolf. Chaney is uncommonly good in his duo role as the sympathetic man doomed to become a murderous beast and Claude Rains gives another memorable performance as concerned father. One of the best werewolf films even after all these years.</fullReview>

The make up of the wolf man to this day to me is still awesome, sure, you can say that it is dated but for a movie like this with practical effects and no CGI is awesome to see because they didn't have the option of it which I am more of a fan of when they actually make it look real. I also like the setting and scenery especially when Lon Chaney gets attacked and is first turned into the wolf man.

		<shortDescription>Lon Chaney Jr. is The Wolf Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wolf Man came out when monster movies where becoming B movies, no longer where they high class productions like Dracula or Frankenstein. The Wolf Man however is actually treated very much like Dracula or Frankenstein, it feels well made and its got the same love and care from Director George Waggner... its just a shame it doesn't quite reach the heights of those films.What do I love about The Wolf Man?, Lon Chaney Jr., thats the main reason. The man gives such an honest portrayal of a man going mad with having to come to terms with, not becoming a werewolf, but the fact he has killed several innocent people without even knowing it. His change from kind, caring son to a scared, worried shell of his former self is fascinating to watch and manages to upstage the performance of the 'star' Claude Rains. The make-up by Jack Pierces is also fantastic, not as iconic or maybe as interesting as the Frankenstein monster but still very good. Claude Rains gives the film its high quality feel. Just like John Saxon in A Nightmare On Elm Street, Rains gives the film some much appreciated star power (Rains also portrayed The Invisible Man in the 1933 film of the same name). The atmosphere is also really nicely created. Lots of fog, desolate woods and tons of shadows, every scene in the woods has an ominous vibe which works so well.What I don't love however is that we never get to see a full transformation sequence, we get to see him go from wolf to man but not man to wolf, the only thing we see is his feet change which although could have set up a brilliant reveal, he is shown 10 seconds later peaking out from behind a tree. There's also no full moon shot either which I would have liked to see. Evelyn Ankers as Grace, Talbots love interest, is bland and uninteresting, not bringing anything to the role and in her scenes with Chaney it seems like he's doing most of the work to portray some on screen chemistry. Overall, flawed and not what I was expecting, however its still a very well made film and the performances of Rains and Chaney make the worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Waggner directed this classic werewolf story that stars Lon Chaney Jr. as Lawrence Talbot, who returns to his homeland in Wales after his brother dies. His father Sir John Talbot(played by Claude Rains) is glad to see him, and hopes he will stay to assume his title, but tragic events are in store as Larry, while visiting a gypsy carnival with his date Jenny Williams, comes to her rescue when she is killed by a wolf, injuring Larry, who survives the bite. This causes much gossip because he was also there with Gwen Conliffe(played by Evelyn Ankers) who is engaged to Groundsman Frank Andrews(played by Patrick Knowles). This further alienates Larry from the village, and he finds that he is now cursed with turning into a murderous wolf man when the moon is full and bright. An old gypsy woman named Maleva tells him of this, and that it was her son Bela(played by Bela Lugosi) that he killed. Larry refuses to believe this, but the evidence is overwhelming, and an equally disbelieving Sir John will have a tragic discovery at the violent climax...Superb film with excellent performances(especially Chaney) a literate script, atmospheric direction, and memorable wolf man makeup. Sure, this can be done more realistically today, but this still holds up fine. A classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low Budget, High Results</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No need to repeat the plot. Since seeing this horror classic as a kid, I've stayed out of the fog and full moons. I also keep an eye on my big dog for more than just fleas. Come to think of it, maybe I should also check my feet to see if they need a shave. Anyway, poor Larry Talbot, he's definitely the most sympathetic of the classic monsters. Chaney never again reached the pinnacle performance he manages here as the star-crossed Talbot. His anguish shows that having extraordinary powers is no fun, least of all, when dog food just won't do.And what a great supporting cast. Still, I wish the producers could have worked in a few clashes between two of the most forceful personalities of the day? Rains and the imposing Warren William. But, tell me, why do movie lovelies like Ankers insist on walking alone, in the foggy woods, with an angry werewolf looking for the type of companionship he can gnaw on. Oh well, I guess there are things we'll never know.But my real Oscar goes to whoever came up with those impressively atmospheric sets. Likely the grand interiors were leftovers from bigger productions. But whatever the source, they add spooky mood and class to the story. All in all, the movie shows how superior results can be achieved, even on smaller budget. Meanwhile, I'm taking my walk while its still sunny. And I'll definitely be back before dark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wolf Man is an atmospheric, well-made, and well-acted movie. It's famous doggerel - "Even a man who is pure in heart", etc, has sort of passed into our culture, and it sustains its aura of tragedy right to the end, proving immensely superior to its recent ham-fisted remake.The film, of course, concerns Lawrence Talbot's (Lon Chaney Jr) return to his ancient family home of Llanwelly, Wales, which looks a lot like Transylvania here. After many years in America. Larry has reconciled with his father Sir John (an excellent Claude Raines), and is to run the Talbot Estate. It isn't long before he has spied (literally through the use of a telescope) the lovely Gwen (Evelyn Ankers), daughter of a local antique shop owner. And of course, there is the sinister party of Gypsies that lurk in the woods.It isn't long before Larry meets Bela (unsuprisingly Bela Lugosi!) who sees the sign of the Pentagram on a soon to be victim when he reads her fortune. Poor Bela, you see, is a werewolf, and he's about to pass on the curse...What still grabs you about the film is Chaney's tortured performance as Larry. Poor Lon was just as tortured in real life as his character, and you wonder how much he's actually acting in the role or just being himself. Chaney was never better than he is here, and he's always good value when playing The Wolfman. The distinguished supporting cast are terrific - perhaps the finest cast assembled for a horror movie at the time. Maria Ouspenskya is a real stand-out as Bela's gypsy mother.Jack Peirce's yak-hair makeup itself has dated of course, and is no longer frightening; but as a gloomy fairy tale the movie still works splendidly. One of Universal's biggest hits of the early 40s, The Wolf Man is still fondly remembered and highly regarded. And it deserves to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great classic horror movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wolf Man is definitely not my favourite Universal Monster. Yeah, he maybe the most sympathetic, but I like the scarier and meaner ones a lot better. However, this does not mean I don't like this movie. In fact, I love this movie! It's just my least favourite Universal Horror movie, but that isn't saying a whole lot.There are some slow parts in this movie. Not a whole lot, but they're there. But there's also a lot of intense scenes in between those that make this movie worth watching. These scenes were made intense with the help of an exciting musical score. Aeriously, more horror movies these days need a real musical score.I also really enjoyed Lon Chaney Jr's performance. You could really feel his fear and torment. It's also evident he learnt something from his father with his facial expressions. And of course no review of The Wolfman is complete without mentioning Jack Peirce's amazing make up job. All that fur must have took forever to put on, but it definitely looked better than just a mask. But there are things I didn't like about this movie. Other than Lon Chaney Jr's character, none of the other character's were all that interesting. Despite this, the actors all give great performances with what they had.Overall, at an hour and ten minutes, this is a short and satisfying film, and I'd recommend it to all horror fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Universial Horror at It's finest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>|Credit. IMDb|A practical man returns to his homeland, is attacked by a creature of folklore, and infected with a horrific disease his disciplined mind tells him can not possibly exist.After watching the Remake a few short weeks ago, I couldn't help but think of this classic right here. There is just no comparison to how great this movie really is. What really makes The Wolfman is the incredible atmosphere. Dated as it may seem, the foggy atmosphere never fails to send chills down my body, and Lon Chaney's electrifying performance still holds up today. What amazed me a lot by revisiting this film, is how the Chaney's transformation into a Wearwolf, still had the same effect on me. It still holds up wonderfully. Lon Chaney and Claude Rain's Father &amp; Son scenes as the Talbot's often highlight this movie. I can honestly say, you will rarely see such a tragic ending that impacts you like this one does.Performances. Lon Chaney Jr. gives a classical performance here. He has all emotions ranging perfectly, and every time I view this movie, I'm on his side the whole way. Claude Rains is just as impressive, but in a different manner. He's more secured about things, and a bit more laid back. But when his intensity rises up in the 2nd half, he's tremendous. Bela Lugosi is effective in his one scene. Ironically enough, his name is Bella. Maria Ouspenskaya is great as Maleva, the old Gypsy. I liked her a lot. Evelyn Ankers makes for a cute, and sympathetic love interest of Chaney's.Bottom line. The Wolf Man is as good as it gets for Horror films. You rarely ever see a Horror movie as well made as this one now a days. It's a classic in every sense of the word, and if you haven't yet seen it. I feel sorry for you.9 1/2 /10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE Classic Werewolf Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arguably THE Classic Werewolf film, George Waggner's "The Wolf Man" of 1941 must be one of the most influential Universal Horror classics, and one of the films that have been most frequently copied and referenced to in later productions. While "The Wolf Man" is not one of the absolute greatest Universal Classics, it is arguably one of the most influential ones. While the film doesn't compare to the brilliance of films such as "Bride of Frankenstein" (1935) or "The Mummy" (1932), the Werewolf genre wouldn't be what it is if it wasn't for "The Wolf Man". Starring the great Lon Chaney Jr. (who subsequently followed his late father to become a true Horror icon) in the eponymous role as well as Claude Reins, who had previously been the eponymous character in James Whale's Universal Horror Classic "The Invisible Man" (1933), the 'tragic monster' story of "The Wolf Man" has inspired the majority of later Werewolf films. While this is not Universal'S first Werewolf film ("The Werewolf of London" is), this film is the one that set the standards for the genre.Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.) is a kind and likable, maybe even slightly dorky man, who comes back to his hometown and immediately falls in love with a local girl (Evelyn Ankers). (It is fun to see, by the way, how pick-up lines have changed in the last 70 years: If someone made advances to a girl today by saying he had been watching her with binoculars, I doubt that he would be very successful.) When they go to have their fortune told by a gypsy one night, Larry gets attacked by a wolf-like creature. He kills the wolf, but is told by an old gypsy woman that it will now be his own fate to become a wolf by full-moon nights...Nice guy gets bitten and becomes a werewolf really is the classic pattern that has been (often greatly) followed by the vast majority of Werewolf films, and "The Wolf Man" simply is THE ultimate classic of this story. Lon Chaney Jr., son of iconic Horror actor Lon Chaney Sr., became an icon himself by appearing as the eponymous monster in this classic. The manner how Chaney jumps from an almost exaggeratedly naive man to the monster is simply fascinating, the man truly deserves the status as one of Horror's true Greats. The cast also includes Claude Reins, who is great as always as Chaney's character's father, and the immortal Horror deity Bela Lugosi in the smaller role of a gypsy named Bela. The film is wonderfully photographed in moody settings and provides the typically great Gothic atmosphere of classic Universal Horror. As mentioned above, it isn't the creepiest or best Universal Horror film, and it probably isn't going to scare anyone's pants off today, but it is still a beautiful, elegant spooky tale with a delightfully eerie mood. Overall, this film truly is a classic, and must bee seen by all fans of Horror and Classic cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rational civillization vs mystical tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those brilliant films that can be watched over and over as it suggests different realities simultaneously. Even if understood as pure horror, it succeeds brilliantly: the fog, the black trees, the gypsies, the tragic Larry, the castle, the werewolf, all these things are well done. However, it can be also be watched as a study in man's helplessness against a growing madness over which he has no control, or again, a subtle psychological portrait of a father and son relationship, or how about England-the land of the old vs America, the land of the technical 'know how' that has lost it's soul as it cannot understand the non material mystery of life. So many things! There are other ways to engage with this film. Because it is so profoundly suggestive , it is almost like a watching a different film each time. Like Murnau's Nosferatu, it is both a horror film and a exploration of the tragedy of human psychological vulnerability and the fragility of civilisation, and all of this in a poetic, other worldly setting that undermines and threatens the pragmatic reality populated by Larry's father and his friends, whose rational civilization cannot redeem Larry from his tragic mystical fate which inevitably destroys him utterly.It may be that Larry's fate frees him from the rationalist prison his father tries to obligate him to. It's dangerous to resist society and live outside of it ("the way you walked was thorny"), but it's still freedom from it, if the universe preordained Larry's tragic fate as a wild man eating wolf, his father had also tried to pre-arrange Larry's life (symbolised perhaps by tying him to a chair). Larry's werewolfism many have a been a means to defy his father, a psychological outgrowth of his inability to articulate his suppressed resentment at his father's control of his life. There are so many ways to watch this film, it's pure poetry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the Universal monster movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, "The Wolf Man" is the best of the Universal monster movies. This is because it combines the Gothic atmosphere of the earlier films with possibly the most well-developed protagonist in any of the films. As the title wolf man, Lon Chaney creates a truly sympathetic individual. His Larry Talbot is a man being overtaken by a physical horror thats completely out of his control. Interestingly enough, there are moments when this resembles more of a psychological horror film that just happens to have a monster in it. Many viewers will be able to relate to Talbot's trauma of losing his mind.While its ultimately Chaney whom makes the film work as well as it does, thats not to sell short the rest of the crew. Director George Waggner creates a brooding Gothic atmosphere and knows how to use fog to good effect. The screenplay by Curt Siodmak is so good its responsible for most of modern werewolf lore.The rest of the cast is quite good as well. Evelyn Ankers does what she can with her character, but apparently she and Chaney hated each other off screen, and this translates to their lack of chemistry. The other performers equip themselves well with the material, especially a typically elegant turn from Claude Rains who adds a great deal of class to the proceedings. "The Wolf Man" is my personal favorite from the original Universal monster movie cycle. It shows why the studio is regarded as untouchable in the hearts of fantastic film buffs the world over.

		<fullReview>"Even a man who is pure at heart and says his prayers by night may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright". This is one of the most classic lines from the world of Horror films along with "It's Alive"(Frankenstein) and "Listen to them, the children of the night....what music they make"(Dracula). Lon Chaney stars as Lawrence Talbot, who returns home to England, is bitten by a werewolf and then becomes one himself. It is very easy to become sympathetic toward his character. He portrays the anguish and shame at what he has become. Claude Rains is excellent as Sir John Talbot, Lawrence Talbot's father. Ralph Bellamy, Evelyn Ankers, Maria Ouspenskaya and Bela Lugosi round out an outstanding cast. The sets and make-up are again incredible(I especially liked the scenes of the fog covered forest). This film set the bar for all future werewolf films and is my favorite along with "Frankenstein's Bloody Terror". Best viewed when the moon is full!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always admired this film. It is carefully constructed and builds to an inevitable,yet moving climax. The musical score is superb. This is a film of marvelous, telling little touches and nuances in both the actors delivery of their lines and their facial reactions. This is also a fine example of ensemble acting, as each actor takes his or her lead in a scene and then ably underplays or plays to the other actor in another scene. Chaney is sensitive, moving and truly memorable in this role. What a fine supporting cast put together for this film. I love the way the movie opens with the opening of an old book in a study and we are led right into the story. I have always felt that this film is one of Hollywoods' finest attempts to put a pure fairy tale onto film. Fine job. Check out the scene in the church where Chaney stands alone in the back, and the camera moves up pew by pew until it rests on Rains and the vacant spot next to him. Nicely done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wolf Man is a Universal Horror picture, made in 1941, directed by George Waggner and starring Lon Chaney Jr. as Larry Talbot, or, as listed in the credits ' The Wolf Man'.The 1940's Universal Studios music,plying over the Universal logo did not go well with the overall film, as it was jolly, loud, and slightly comedic, and it gave me the wrong impression as to how the film was going to turn out. However, I am pleased to say, it is one of the few flaws of the film.The film begins with the title screen of the Wolf Man, accompanied by eerie music, followed by the credits, which consisted of clips of the actors taken from the film, with their name and the character they starred as, overlaid on top of those clips. The credits of the crew are then played, with the backing video track, slowly tracking through a forest, the same shot used in the opening credits of Ghost of Frankenstein, Night Monster and The Mummy's Curse.Claude Rains as Sir John Talbot, delivers a terrific performance as a father figure for Larry, despite the difference in appearance of Rains and Chaney Jr. Lon Chaney's performance as Larry Talbot, is just as good, although I find it easier to sympathise with Henry Hull's character 'Doctor Wilfred Glendon' in 'Werewolf of London'.I would recommend this movie to anyone, young or old, as it is a true classic, and everyone should have the experience of viewing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wolf Man (1941) Monster Boy's Rating: **** (out of 5) God bless Universal! It was and still is remembered as the most brilliant studio when it comes to horror pictures. The horror genre was a mine of gold to Universal during the 30's, 40's, and 50's. In 1941, "The Wolf Man" came out, with the brilliants Lon Chaney Jr. and Claude Rains. The movie was a smash hit and was frightening at the time.The story is really fantasious and smart, tight-up and well written. The actors are really good, providing an ambiental feel for the movie. The movie flows easily and well providing nice scenes and memorable quotes. There are some cool effects judging the time and all and it is really good.One more success for Universal, "The Wolf Man" was an example of dramatic beast, a man hidden inside monstruous flesh. Perfectly portrayed by Chaney, the Wolf Man became a human like monster, a legend lost in the dark.</fullReview>

"Even a man who is pure of heart and says his prayers by night, may become a wolf when the wolf bane blooms and the autumn moon is bright." In the sequel, Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man, the last line was changed to: "when the moon is full and bright."

		<fullReview>The Wolfman is a true werewolf classic. Lon Chaney may have been the finest actor to ever portray a werewolf. It's a shame he didn't make any major hits besides the monstermovies he was in. He was sure one of the most underrated actors for his time. The main downside was probably having Bela Lugosi as an ill-fated gypsy/werewolf. That was not the role for him. However, the rest of the cast members turned in stellar performances, such as Claude Rain, and Evelyn Ankers. The big highlight of this classic was probably the make up effects which was outstanding forits time. The new DVD version is definitely worth a look at whether you've seen this film or not.

		<shortDescription>Chaney's Finest Hour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wolf Man" gave Lon Chaney Jr. the character with which he would be most identified with for the rest of his life. It was the first time I believe, that he got to play the lead and romance the leading lady. After 18 years in America, Lawrence Talbot (Chaney) returns to his ancestral home in England following the death of his older brother. His father Sir John Talbot (Claude Rains) welcomes him back and prepares him to take over the Talbot Estates. Larry Talbot meets the fetching Gwen Conliffe (Evelyn Ankers) and a romance begins. On their first date they go to a gypsy camp to have their fortunes read along with Gwenn's friend Jenny. The gypsy fortune teller Bela (Bela Lugosi) turns out to be a werewolf and attacks and kills Gwenn's friend. When Larry comes to her aid he is bitten before he kills the beast with his silver headed cane. The next morning the body of Jenny and that of Bela are found. Larry's cane is found next to Bela's body. The local constable, Paul Montford (Ralph Bellamy) investigates. Dr. Lloyd (Warren William) and Gwenn's fiance Frank Andrews (Patric Knowles) are a little suspicious of Larry's story. An old gypsy woman (Maria Ouspenskaya) tells Larry that Bela was a werewolf and "He who is bitten by a werewolf and lives, himself becomes a werewolf." Larry at first doubts her but soon learns otherwise. Chaney displays his considerable talent in this film. He plays Talbot with fear and pity as he comes to learn of the curse that has befallen him. Rains adds a bit of class as Chaney's father however, he hardly looked old enough to be Chaney's father. Bellamy, William and Knowles are competent in their respective roles. Its Maria Ouspenskaya who almost steals the film from Chaney. Her "old gypsy woman" would be the template for all such roles that followed. Bela Lugosi has little more than a cameo as the doomed gypsy Bela. Odd that all of the supposed Britishers have for the most part, American accents. This film should have been Chaney's big break but circumstances dictated otherwise. Universal never did know how to utilize Chaney's talents. On one hand they tried to make him a horror star, while on the other, they cast him in supporting roles in a number of serials and second feature westerns. At the time the U.S. was about to enter World War II and Universal's horror films were losing their appeal to the real life horrors of war. Universal tried to rescue the genre by putting two or more of their monsters into the same film. So, the Wolf Man had to share the screen with the Frankenstein monster in "Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man" (1943) and others. Chaney always gave his best in these films but they suffered overall from reduced budgets and "B" movie status.  The Wolf Man wound up playing a foil to Abbott And Costello in one of their best comedies, Abbot &amp; Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE WOLF MAN (Universal, 1941), directed by George Waggner, with an original screenplay by Curt Siodmak, is regarded by many to be Lon Chaney Jr.'s best movie role in the horror cycle which helped advanced his career after nearly ten years on the screen. Inasmuch as his role as Lennie Small in the screen treatment to John Steinbeck adaptation of OF MICE AND MEN (United Artists, 1939), might have opened the door for him in more meatier dramatic roles, his titled character as The Wolf Man set the pattern for the kind of roles that were to come.In spite that THE WOLF MAN marked the birth of a new Universal monster, and that during this cycle of the early 1940s, Universal resurrected several earlier screen monsters to the screen, ranging from The Frankenstein Monster, The Invisible Man, The Mummy and later Dracula, which were mostly performed by actors other than the ones who originated these characters, it should be noted the Lon Chaney Jr. did not become Hollywood's original wolf man. Looking back at 1935, Universal's screen treatment of THE WEREWOLF OF London starred Henry Hull as Henry Glendon, a scientist who becomes the victim of an attack and a curse the changes him into a werewolf whenever the moon is full. After Glendon's demise, no sequel or any attempt of a sequel has been made. So now enter Lawrence Talbot! He's not the usual doomed scientist this time, but only a victim of circumstance.THE WOLF MAN starts innocently enough. Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.) is seen returning to his ancestral estate of Talbot Castle after being away 18 years, where he is greeted by his father, Sir John (Claude Rains). Afterwards, Larry becomes attracted to Gwen Conliffe (Evelyn Ankers), a young girl employed in an antique shop whom he earlier had spied on through a telescope aimed towards her room. While in the shop, Gwen shows Larry an interesting cane with a silver top in the form of a wolf's head, and recites the verse, "Even a man who's pure at heart, and says his prayers by night, may become a wolf when the wolf-bane blooms, and the autumn moon is bright." Larry then purchases the cane on the promise that Gwen go out with him that night. In spite that Gwen is engaged to a young man named Frank Andrews (Patric Knowles), she agrees to become his tour guide about town. With Gwen's friend, Jenny Williams (Fay Helm), to accompany them, the trio head for a nearby gypsy camp to have their fortunes told. While at the camp, Jenny has her fortune told by a gypsy named Bela (Bela Lugosi), who notices a pentagram materialize in her palm. Horrified, Bela warns Jenny to leave the camp as fast as she can. Frightened, Jenny takes his advise and leaves, only to not make it safely home. Moments later, Jenny is seen being attacked by some creature that kills her. Hearing the screams, Larry runs over save her, only to be attacked, but to defeat and kill his attacker with the silver cane. During the next full moon, Larry, finds himself changing into a werewolf, and through no fault of his own, with an urge to kill. He would later learn the terrible truth about his curse from Meleva (Maria Ouspenskaya), a gypsy woman, that he, too, is the victim of a curse that started by the attack of her gypsy son, Bela, who happened to be a werewolf. Larry is considered insane when he tries to explain the circumstance to his father.THE WOLF MAN is a well made horror movie that makes one forget that this is only a modestly budget "B" film. Unlike most horror films of the time, THE WOLF MAN has an outstanding cast of marquee names, including Warren William as Doctor Lloyd; Ralph Bellamy as Captain Paul Montford; with character actors as J.M. Kerrigan as Gwen's father; Forrester Harvey and Doris Lloyd. The biggest casting surprise is Bela Lugosi, ten years after starring in his legendary performance as Dracula (1931), with only a few scenes to be considered an extended cameo. His role as Bela the Gypsy may be brief, but not unimportant. He's the key element to what becomes of Lawrence Talbot. Another memorable character that comes to mind is Meleva, played by Ouspenskaya, who has left a legacy with her performance. An excellent actress, Ouspenskaya not only played Meleva, she IS Meleva. Other than its impressive moody sets, ranging from a fog-shrouded marsh to moonlit graveyard, for example, Larry Talbot's transformation scenes are most memorable, with creepy makeup, compliments of Jack Pierce, along with the wolf man's prowls to his victims.THE WOLF MAN may present itself to be just another black and white horror flick of long ago to most younger viewers immuned to more graphic and violent results, but the screen treatment to this production satisfies with several killings actually accomplished discreetly and not directly, and the storyline being precise and to the point, coming to a satisfactory conclusion in 71 minutes. Whether planned sequel(s) to this film were intended or not, it is quite obvious that THE WOLF MAN did become a hit, because a whole new series was born with this one. Regardless of the numerous times Chaney reprized his Talbot/Wolf Man character, his first is no doubt the best.THE WOLF MAN, which used to air on the Sci-Fi Channel in the 1990s, American Movie Classics where it premiered in 1991, and Turner Classic Movies (TCM premiere October 10, 1998), makes good viewing on Halloween night. It's was also available on video cassette before going to DVD from MCA/Universal Home Video. So before watching this on television, beware, and LOCK your doors! (*** howls)</fullReview>

Just as Karloff and Lugosi were (respectively) the Frankenstein Monster and Dracula, Chaney came into his own in the role that he's best remembered for. For an actor of limited abilities, he brings a complex pathos to his haunting portrayal.'The Wolfman' should be a lesson on providing great entertainment at a modest budget with great actors, eerie atmosphere and a little folklore. Not that this is without flaws and some major plot holes in logic (why is Talbot packed off to bed after being attacked by the werewolf, with no medical attention, heck, not even a band-aid, and there's observations that his clothes were bloodied). In fact, there are so many flaws, that to list them all would fill pages. But that would be unfair to what has been widely appreciated as one of Universal's best horror films that still entertains after 60 years.This movie provides top notch support from Claude Rains, Ralph Bellamy, Maria Ouspenskaya, Bela Lugosi and Evelyn Ankers (who masks her accent so well that most people don't realize her natural accent is British, born in Chile to English parents). And it's amazing what some excellent lighting, a little black paint on some gnarled trees and lots of fog can do to evoke a foreboding, fairy tale horror.There are other werewolf movies that followed (the very good 'Curse of the Werewolf'; the excellent 'An American Werewolf in London'), but this was the 1st one that was so good, that it spawned many sequels (unlike 'Werewolf of London'). And unlike the fate of other Universal Monsters (that Chaney unsuccessfully gave a go at), only he portrayed his most popular role in the next four follow-ups. The fact that you never see Talbot's face transform into the Wolf Man is more than made up in the next installment 'Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man'. Because both movies are under 75 minutes, this makes an exceptional double feature.8 out of 10 ! One of my all time favorites!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite film of the Universal classic collection!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my mind, this is the greatest classic horror film of all time. It towers over FRANKENSTEIN and makes DRACULA look like a B- flick. This is the best of the Universal Studios Classic Collection. This is truly a great film.*POSSIBLE SPOILERS* After returning to his father's (Claude Rains) castle, Larry Talbot is bitten by a werewolf. But to his horror, he too soon becomes one under the full moon and against his own will attacks the unsuspecting townspeople. I really love the eerie and chilling mood that the film provides. Even though some of the makeup effects and dialogue are lame, this is still my personal favorite of the great classic horror films. Everyone should see this film. If you are a fan of horror or not. THE WOLF MAN: 5/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to catch this on AMC last night sometime after the witching hour. I was just about to fall asleep when they announced "Up next on AMC: Lon Chaney Jr. as The Wolf Man." I've never been a fan of the "classics." Not because I don't like them, but, because it's not my generation. I've never really gave them much thought. But they do deserve their credit. As does The Wolf Man. It definitely survived the test of time. Larry Talbot is one of the greatest tragic anti-heroes of all time. Lon Chaney played the role of Larry Talbot so well that he would don the make-up on four other occasions. And what great make-up it is for the forties. Jack Pierce is a make-up legend. I'm hoping that Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, and The Creature From the Black Lagoon all live up to my new expectations. After viewing The Wolf Man, I'm hoping AMC plays all of the classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's an icon of horror film, from another time in movies altogether, today sneered at and ridiculed for not being a slime-producing blood-letter created by CGI effects or whatever tedious animation is used to create monsters these days.This is a tragedy involving a 1940s brute played simply and eagerly by Lon Chaney. He encounters a supernatural creature, a werewolfcommitting a gruesome murder, and in attempting to stop it is himself bitten and cursed.The Wolf Man is Chaney unleashed, and that is frightening in itself. Chaney is a huge man, suddenly a raving blood-thirsty psychotic. With claws. But in direct contrast to his size, Chaney is gentle, soft-spoken, and horrified at what he becomes. He loves a girl, but he is a monster even in human form: he cannot die, and when he is the Wolf Man he will try to hunt and kill the girl. Chaney's soul has been stolen, his life, and any chance for being a man, a father, or a lover.Chaney is heart-broken, and that is the most powerful image in this movie. This is all about Chaney, a story built around his size, theimposing violence of a lunatic who cannot be killed by normal means, a man who just wants to put his arm around a girl while strolling on a foggy night, to protect her. What if the worst thing in that fog is himself? Knowing that, Chaney's performance is THE performance to witness the true horror of an ordinary man turned into an undying monster, and how much an immortal can suffer. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wolf Man is Re-discovered gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having recently undertaken the enjoyable task of watching all of Universal's "Classic Monster" series, I can say with renewed enthusiasm that THE WOLF MAN is one of the best. As a screen monster, he's always been pushed to the back in favor of Drac &amp; Frank, and this is unfortunate. In Lon Chaney's Larry Talbot, we have a most human and believable character (though his "gee whiz" mannerisms perhaps have not dated so well). His continual disbelief at the superstitions surrounding him echoes the audience's similiar feelings. Only the abrupt climax detracts from an otherwise excellent horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror classic with bite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the role of the lychanthropic Larry Talbot, Lon Chaney, Jr., the son of the "Man of a Thousand Faces," achieved stardom, but the triumph of this classic is not his alone. Few horror films, even the genuine classics produced in the genre's golden age, benefitted from such a first rate cast. Ralph Bellamy, Bela Lugosi, Maria Ouspenskaya, and, particularly, Claude Rains as Chaney's skeptical father, are all excellent. The direction by George Waggner is assured and atmospheric, and it's a shame he passed away before being able to offer Mike Nichols some much needed pointers when directing his 1994 werewolf thriller, "Wolf." There have been plenty of werewolves since Chaney, Jr. stalked the screen, but all have lacked the original's bite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many of the classic versions of 'monster' movies, "The Wolf Man" does not seem quite so scary anymore, but it's still an enjoyable film. The story is interesting if slightly predictable, the settings give it a good atmosphere, and the cast of now familiar faces does a good job. The werewolf scenes hold up pretty well, too, even if they aren't as dazzling as modern special effects would be. Overall, it's probably a cut below some of the other monster classics like "Frankenstein", "Bride of Frankenstein", and "Dracula", but it's still good entertainment, worth remembering and watching from time-to-time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The other day I was watching one of my VHS tapes and a commercial played showing all the old Universal Picture monster movies and I used to absolutely love watching them as a kid, they always gave me the creeps. But my parents only bought Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Bride of Frankenstein, so I went out and rented the rest of the movies I had missed out on to watch at home. The Wolf Man was first on my watch list and I still have such a strong love for these classic movies. I try to put myself back in the time that this was released and I could only imagine just the amazement that people experienced watching Lon Chaney change into the wolf man. The whole atmosphere of the movie is just creepy and the cast is exceptional, Bela Lugosi was one of the best in the cast as the creepy gypsy who was also the first werewolf. Lon Chaney made a great wolf man and was a tragic character that made this movie a memorable classic.Larry Talbot returns to his ancestral home in Llanwelly, Wales to reconcile with his father. While there, Larry becomes romantically interested in a local girl named Gwen Conliffe, who runs an antique shop. As a pretext, he buys something from her, a silver-headed walking stick decorated with a wolf. Gwen tells him that it represents a werewolf. That night, Larry attempts to rescue Gwen's friend Jenny from what he believes to be a sudden attack by a wolf. He kills the beast with his new walking stick, but is bitten in the process. He soon discovers that it was not just a wolf; it was a werewolf, and now Talbot has become one. A gypsy fortuneteller reveals to Larry that the animal which bit him was actually her son Bela in the form of a wolf. Bela had been a werewolf for years and now the curse of lycanthropy has been passed to Larry.I loved The Wolf Man, I love all these classic monster movies, even if they are old, they're a lot of fun to watch. There's such magic to the old Hollywood, this was before the teenage slasher films and silly clichés. Though I have to admit, it's a fun plot hole, Lon Chaney is in a wife beater shirt and pants, he changes into the werewolf, then when he's wondering around the woods in a fully buttoned up shirt and longer pants was just so funny, I could only assume that maybe he wanted to look good while slaughtering the innocent. The look and feel of this film was just great and very creepy, the effects were absolutely incredible for the time and imagine the look on the audience's faces when they were seeing this movie in the theater for the first time. The Wolf Man is a classic horror film that won't loose it's touch on chilling it's audience.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointing 'classic'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the death of his brother, Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.) returns to his ancestral home?a large estate in a rural Welsh village?where he is reunited with his estranged father, Sir John (Claude Rains), and meets and falls for local lovely Gwen Conliffe (Evelyn Ankers). Larry's new life goes awry, however, when he survives an attack by a wolf, and becomes convinced that when the full moon rises, he will become a monster with an uncontrollable desire to kill the one he loves most...I cannot deny the importance of Universal's The Wolf Man to the world of horror, since it introduces fans of scary films to many of the now-accepted rules of cinematic lycanthropy, but I still consider it to be something of a disappointment.Curt Siodmak's script spends way too much time talking about werewolves rather than actually delivering them; George Waggner's direction is atmospheric but awkward, developing plot elements and then suddenly dropping them like hot coals; the acting is poor (Maria Ouspenskaya and Bela Lugosi ham it up as gypsies, whilst Rains and Chaney fail to convince as father and son); and Jack Pierce's wolfish make-up is less than convincing (and the illusion is not helped by having the hulking, hairy Chaney stalk his victims on tiptoes!).Director Waggner manages to deliver a few impressively eerie scenes in a fog-shrouded forest, and Evelyn Ankers is easy on the eye, but as far as Universal monster movies go, this one definitely isn't leader of the pack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.) returns from America to the Talbot Castle in the countryside of England after the death of his brother to help his father Sir John Talbot (Claude Rains) to administrate his real estate. Larry accidentally sees the gorgeous Gwen Conliffe (Evelyn Ankers) while adjusting his father's telescope and visits her in the antique shop of her father. He buys a cane with a silver wolf and invites her to date him at night. They go to a gypsy camping with Gwen's friend Jenny Williams (Fay Helm) and she goes to see the fortuneteller Bela (Bela Lugosi) that tells her that she is in danger. When Jenny runs through the woods, she is attacked by a wolf. Larry kills the animal with his cane but is bitten in the shoulder. Gwen brings him home while Colonel Montford (Ralph Bellamy) investigates the crime scene and finds Jenny and Bela dead. On the next morning, the wound of Larry is healed and he has a pentagram on his chest. Larry believes he is a werewolf while Dr. Lloyds (Warren William) believes Larry has a disturbed mind. Meanwhile the local villagers believe that Larry is a killer."The Wolf Man" is one of the unforgettable classic monsters from Universal Studios. The dramatic story of Larry Talbot has a brilliant performance of Lon Chaney Jr., magnificent black and white cinematography and the DVD has a fantastic Extra called "Monster by Moonlight!" hosted by John Landis with the immortal saga of the Wolf Man that provides additional information about the story, cast and crew. One of the most relevant is that the in original folkloric story, Larry Talbot is an ambiguous character that believes he is a werewolf; however the studio interfered in the plot and transformed his belief in reality. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "O Lobisomem" ("The Werewolf")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen very many horror films recently except for the Joan Collins crapfest I DON'T WANT TO BE BORN and Danny Boyle's tense , thrilling but totally flawed 28 DAYS LATER so I was looking forward to seeing the legendary Universal studio release of THE WOLFMAN which was broadcast on BBC 2 earlier tonight . Boy was I disappointed ! First let me point out the good bits . Curt Siodmak has made a horror movie with a cutting subtext . Siodmak had left Nazi Germany a few years previously due to the rise of Hitler and Larry Talbot mirrors the experiences of Siodmak ( This becomes clearer in the latter Universal films in the series where Talbot finds himself a refugee in a foreign land ) and it's impossible not to be reminded of the horrors of Nazism when the victims of the werewolf develop a pointed star on their bodies , Jewish angst and anti semitism is at the heart of this movie . It should also be remembered that much of traditional werewolf folklore that we know today ( Full moons , pentagrams , werewolves being killed by silver bullets etc ) isn't in fact traditional at all and was entirely invented by Siodmak for this script!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! Unfortunately the story itself is very threadbare and inconsequential and runs like this : Man returns to his Welsh birthplace , becomes a werewolf , kills a grave digger , gets killed himself . The end . And that's basically the story . If you were watching this in 1941 who would you be more frightened of ? Larry Talbot or that damned Hitler chappie ? By concentrating on such an intelligent and contemporary subtext with his screenplay it seems Mr Siodmak forgot to write a story to go with itThere is another problem many of the critics have picked up on and that is that THE WOLFMAN is very dated when viewed today . Hidden esoteric meaning aside it's not very sophisticated ( A problem with most of the Universal horror films when viewed today ) with something resembling a teddy bear stalking a film studio exterior set . Not very scary . It's impossible not to notice that despite being set in Wales not one single character has a Welsh accent . I wonder if any Americans even know where Wales is ?This might sound like sacrilege but I didn't think Lon Chaney Jnr had the acting range to generate enough sympathy for Larry Talbot . Sorry if that offends anyone . In fact the only person I thought gave a good performance was Claude Rains as Sir John TalbotI was thoroughly disappointed with THE WOLFMAN after seeing it again for the first time in something like 20 years and its only real value is that it has contributed so much to modern werewolf folkloreSix out of ten</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like The Company of Wolves but other than that I'm really not a fan of werewolf movies. However having seen and enjoyed classics such as Dracula and Frankenstein from Universal I thought I should give this classic a chance too. I think story-wise this one beats the former two. here we have a monster that really doesn't want to be a villain but he cannot fight or escape his fate. Wolf man Larry is marvelously played by Lon Chaney Jr. I have seen some people complain about the bad make-up but I don't think it was too bad and it didn't really bother me. I think this was more than horror with some very nice psychological scenes put in, a potential love story too. Strong scene when the son accepts his sad fate and gives the cane with silver handle to his father. He says goodbye, so sad that the father didn't understand it. Nice support role from Maria Ouspenskaya as gypsy woman, she really looked authentic. Cool to have horror icon Bela Lugosi as gypsy fortune teller even if his screen time is extremely limited. If you don't know anything about werewolves this movie teaches you what you need to know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason why this movie works is because of the performance of Lon chaney Jr. The corny makeup doesn't really matter. Obviously a movie like this is going to be hurt by the censorship of the times. But in this movie, the focus is on the pain of the lead character and the inevitable disaster. That is why the movie works better than most horror movies of the same period.I have a soft spot for such movies where the lead character is in a tough situation from which there is no escape. He was just in a wrong place at the wrong time. Frankly I was not a fan of the dad character. He didn't really seem understanding of the situation. Sure he did help with the police and all but he could have let him go out of town. It would not mattered of course since the illness would still haunt him. But at least the girl would be safe.I am not sure if it works as a pure horror movie. I don't think it has many creepy scenes. And often the corny makeup is a problem. I thought the movie would have worked better if there was a real wolf and if there was an effective transformation scene. But then I guess the special effects were not possible then.It was really depressing to see Larry losing his grip on sanity and getting further away from Gwen. It finally ends in a tragic way but at least in the end, his reputation is unspoilt.I liked the movie overall 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric and tragic tale of man verses beast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being the second Universal werewolf movie (after "Werewolf in London (1935)) it is nevertheless the iconic image of the furry-faced man-beast as played by Lon Chaney Jr. as "The Wolf Man" (make-up courtesy of Jack Pierce) which has entered popular culture alongside Boris Karloff as Frankenstein's Monster and Bela Lugosi as Dracula. Moreso, this is the movie which has given us much of the werewolf mythology (gypsy folktales, wolfsbane, silver) which has influenced cinematic depictions ever since.After the death of his brother, the estranged Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.) returns from the States to the estate of his British father, Sir John Talbot (Claude Rains). The pair reacquaint themselves and, after helping his father fit a lens for his telescope, Larry becomes infatuated with the beautiful Gwen (Evelyn Ankers) whom he accidentally spies on. He wastes no time in going over to the shop where she works to introduce himself and, between flirting and being turned down, he buys a cane replete with a silver wolf's head and learns about the werewolf myth for the first time. However, through his likable innocent charm, Larry succeeds in accompanying Gwen to a gypsy fortune teller, played by Bela Lugosi who, as a werewolf kills the pair's friend, Jenny. Larry kills the beast, but not before being bitten himself and thus becoming the new inheritor of the werewolf curse.One of the starkest contrasts between "The Werewolf of London" and "The Wolf Man" is the likability of the character. Whereas both men do a good job of showing the inner battle of man verses beast, the inherent likability of Larry Talbot as a character makes the viewer care much more about him and thus adds more pathos to the tragic climax. Another point which adds to our sympathy for Larry is the unjust attachment to the grisly murders conferred upon him by local busybodies and the subsequent way his friends and family support him, unbeknownst to them the horrific curse he is under. Another major difference in tone is that "The Wolf Man" is much more atmospheric than the comparably clinical feel of "Werewolf in London", with much of the film taking place amidst a fog-strewn forest among barren trees, first when the gypsies come to town and most grippingly during the final hunt for the werewolf. This is a key point as in the days of relatively rudimentary special effects and low gore, the atmosphere was the thing which really communicated the horror.However, one criticism I have is that even though Jack Pierce's make-up effects in his movie have been lauded (as indeed they were for "Frankenstein", "The Black Cat", The Mummy" et al.) I personally prefer the make-up he did for the earlier "Werewolf in London" as I find the Wolf Man, dare I say it, a bit cute! Sure, I can suspend my disbelief enough to enter into the spirit of the movie, but I can't help but feel that the wolf in the earlier movie is more savage and scarier. Still, a small point and one which never threatened to stifle my enjoyment of this deserved classic which stands as a must-see for all horror enthusiasts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lon Chaney, Jr., Claude Rains, Evelyn Ankers and Bela Lugosi star in this 1941 horror classic. I won't give away the film's plot because most of us know what it is. Chaney Jr. plays mild-mannered man, Larry Talbot, Rains (The Invisible Man) plays his father, John, Ankers plays Larry's girlfriend, Gwen and Lugosi (Dracula) plays gypsy man, Maleva. This definitely paved the way for other werewolf films and has a great spooky atmosphere. Chaney Jr. is terrific in it and will always be the definitive Wolf Man in my opinion. Jack Pierce's make-up effects also still hold up well and Pierce also did make-up for other original horror classics, "Frankenstein," "The Mummy," "Phantom of the Opera" and "Creature from the Black Lagoon." I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Classic Horror Film from Days Gone By</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a hunting accident which claims the life of his older brother, "Larry Talbot" (Lon Chaney Jr.) returns after 18 years abroad to his ancestral home in England to reside with his father "Sir John Talbot" (Claude Rains) at Talbot Castle. One day, while peering through a telescope he installed for his father, he accidentally spies "Gwen Conliffe" (Evelyn Ankers) in her room above an antique store and decides to make her acquaintance. That night he takes Gwen and her friend "Jenny Williams" (Fay Helm) to a nearby Gypsy camp to have their fortunes told. When Jenny is attacked by a werewolf he rushes to her defense but arrives too late. Although he manages to kill the werewolf, he is subsequently bitten in the process. And so the curse of the werewolf is passed on to him. Now, even though the special effects are rather basic compared to today's standards and it isn't the first werewolf movie ever made, this film probably does as much as any other motion picture to popularize the werewolf legacy. Obviously some folks may not like it. But for those who enjoy a good classic horror film from days gone by then this one probably won't disappoint anyone.</fullReview>

The Wolf Man has its charm and is very memorable with some great scenes and dialogue, like the gypsy poem. Lon Chaney Jr. gives a decent performance of a many struggling with a curse that will forever change his life. One thing that always bugged me about the movie was they seem to have struggled with setting it in one century or time-period between the 1800's and the 1940's. I guess it's not a huge deal, but just seeing cars driving around in this particular movie does feel a bit odd. Now before someone goes crazy on me, I do appreciate this movie a great deal. Most of the lore about werewolves can be traced back to this movie such as being turned by a bite and transforming when there is a full moon. It's still a great classic horror movie that everyone can enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young American returns to his family home in England. While there he is attacked by a werewolf and soon starts transform.Universal's second stab at the legend of werewolves is a brisk but brilliant little horror film. It knows when to have fun and when to focus on the horror. The characters all interact well and manage to build well defined relationships in the hour and 10 minutes of film. It's very doubtful that this will be scaring any newcomers,but the atmosphere and pacing make it a delightfully exhilarating watch. Like all werewolf mythology it examines the beast within. My only complaint is that the end comes all too sudden. A bit anticlimactic under the circumstances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch out when the Wolfbane Blooms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a classic Universal Studios horror film from 1941. It has top notch actors of the day Claude Rains (Casablanca), Bella Lugosi (Dracula) and the son of silent film star Lon Chaney, Lon Chaney Jr as the Wolf Man. It's interesting to note that Universal created the Wolf Man rather than using a more familiar monster like in many of their other previous horror films Frankenstein (1931), Dracula (1931). Curt Siodmak the screenwriter creates a spooky tale that is fairly high quality for the genre.Larry Talbot returns to his ancestral village for the first time in 18 years. He has been living in California but the recent death of his brother has brought him home. Sir John Talbot (Rains) his father is happy to have him return home and wants to groom him to run the family estate. While setting up his father's telescope Larry sees a local girl Gwen (Evelyn Ankers). He is smitten and goes to introduce himself to this daughter of the local antiques shop owner. While at the shop Larry purchases a silver topped cane adorned with a wolf's head. He then proceeds to set up a date with the beautiful Gwen to get their fortunes read at the traveling gypsy encampment. When the date starts Larry is surprised that third wheel Jenny (Fay Helm) will be tagging along. While at the Gypsy encampment Jenny is killed by a werewolf (Bela Lugosi) who Larry beats to death with is new cane. Unfortunately, for Larry he has been bitten by the werewolf. The rest of the movie focuses on Larry's onset of lycanthropy and how the other characters in the film react to him.While at times I found Lon Chaney Jr. to be a bit ham fisted in his acting the rest of the actors were excellent. Chaney Jr's thespian shortcomings were easily forgiven once his transformation into the wolf man was complete. He flat out plays a good monster. The makeup work for the transformation is something to behold. This film has a bit of a campy feel to it in today's blood and guts horror age. That being said it's certainly a horror classic worth the investment in your viewing schedule. There is a lot of great atmosphere in the film and plenty of creepy moments that while not scary in modern terms are certainly memorable. As an aside, I particularly enjoyed the gypsy camp as part of the plot. There just isn't enough use of gypsy's as a plot device. "Even a man who is pure of heart, and says his prayers by night, may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms, and the autumn moon is bright." The gypsy maleva (Maria Ouspenskaya)This film is currently available on Netflix instant view for streaming. I really enjoyed the film and at a brief seventy minute run time you won't have to suffer long if you disagree with my assessment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wolf Man (1941) ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Dracula and the Frankenstein Monster, the character of The Wolf Man is probably the most well-known of all of the iconic old monsters from the heyday at Universal Studios. And with good reason too, as Lon Chaney Jr. was superb in the role, playing a doomed man who arouses our sympathy when he is tormented by the tragic consequences that befall him after being bitten by another werewolf.Lawrence Talbot (Chaney) is the son of Sir John Talbot (Claude Rains), and arrives home to reconcile with dad after many years estranged. A very jolly and pleasant type of everyman fellow, Larry seems clumsily awkward as the benefactor of his father's plush estate, which he will soon be required to run on his own. Larry also makes a play for the beautiful local shopkeeper's daughter (Evelyn Ankers), but one night while out on a date with her he's attacked by a wolf in a misty forest and is left with the bite that curses him and changes his personality completely... not to mention his physical characteristics during nights when the full moon blooms!What makes THE WOLF MAN rise above its B-level status, aside from Chaney's exceptional performance, is its ambiance of folklore and the wisdom of the ages. Also boasting a great musical score by Frank Skinner and Hans Salter as well as outstanding monster makeup by Jack Pierce, THE WOLF MAN stands out from the usual run of the mill affairs that were beginning to occur with Universal during the 1940s. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Wolf Man" (1941) movie review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmmaker George Waggner may not have known the great horror legacy he was about to unleash on the cinematic community when he directed "The Wolf Man" in 1941. Although preceded six years earlier by "Werewolf of London" (1935), "The Wolf Man" will be the horror movie classic people will always remember. And Waggner selected an all-star cast of Hollywood regulars to fill in the shoes of the characters.The Wolf Man is undoubtedly the most tragic and sympathetic of the movie monsters mainly because the horror he unleashes upon his hapless victims is usually through no fault of his own; he has become a monster unwillingly. (That is why the Wolf Man is my personal favorite of the old-school movie monsters.) This is a trait that this movie really helped to popularize about werewolves in general and has had an enormous influence on subsequent portrayals of lycanthropes in the movies and horror literature.Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney) returns to his family estate in Wales upon receiving news of his brother's death. He reunites with his father Sir John Talbot (Claude Raines) and ends up falling in love with a beautiful local woman named Gwen Conliffe (Evelyn Ankers). One night, he tries to save Gwen's friend Jenny (Fay Helm) from an attack by a large wolf-like animal, and in turn is bitten during the scuffle. An enigmatic local Gypsy woman, Maleva (Maria Ouspenskaya), pronounces Larry as being cursed by the mark of the werewolf, and only the next full moon will show him sprouting hair and fangs and afflicted with a sudden taste for human flesh."The Wolf Man," at the time of its release, was a true screamer of a horror picture with first-rate performances from its cast (especially Lon Chaney as the doomed protagonist Larry Talbot), moody atmosphere and music, lavish visuals, bizarre characters, surreal bursts of violence (for the time), and elaborate set design (all filmed on a series of elaborate, fog-drenched stages, I hear). With its fog-drenched Welsh locales, the film pretty much oozes dread from the very first frame and it carries on until the very end. And as I stated earlier, the real tragedy of any Wolf Man is the fact that he has become a monster unwillingly, and his story must always end in tragedy, as is usually proved by this film's ending (and usually almost all werewolf movies, so I don't know if I really spoiled anything here).You can laugh about this film's special effects (by Jack P. Pierce) all you want. Yeah, sure, they're dated by today's overblown CGI standards, but back in the day (1941), this was truly state-of-the-art stuff here. Lon Chaney Jr.'s alleged claims about his ordeal in the makeup chair are well-known, but then again so are the truths that it was not as labor- and pain-intensive as he would've had us originally believe. Regardless of him stretching the truth about his plight here, he created his most unique. memorable and iconic character in Larry Talbot/The Wolf Man, and his portrayal has lasted for over 60 years and has influenced entire generations of horror filmmakers.Lastly, it is without question that "The Wolf Man" also played a hand in influencing filmmaker John Landis, who wrote and directed his beloved landmark horror-comedy "An American Werewolf in London" in 1981, which in some ways can be said to be a modern update of "The Wolf Man" - even if Landis has never actually acknowledged that fact though it is clear that he was nonetheless influenced by this picture. "An American Werewolf in London" is my favorite werewolf movie ever, but I also like "The Wolf Man" for paving the way to that classic horror picture.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The start of the werewolf genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wolf Man" is a classic in the horror genre.**SPOILERS**Larry Talbot, (Lon Chaney) an aspiring astronomer, returns to his family home and takes a liking to Gwen, (Evelyn Ankers) a shopkeeper in town. Taking her and a friend to a gypsy camp to have her fortune's told, Gwen's friend receives a grave reading about her future. Shortly after, she is attacked in the marshes while Larry is attacked. His father, Sir John, (Claude Raines) doctor, (Warren William) and the local inspector (Ralph Bellamy) insist Larry's delusion version of events can be easily explained. Trying to get Larry goes to Maleva, (Maria Ouspenskava) that he has be bitten and will become a werewolf. Laughing it off as a mere superstition, he thinks nothing of it, until people start turning up dead from vicious animal. Convinced now that he is responsible, Larry tries to cope with the change while not letting no one else know of his secret.The Good News: This is the one film that started the werewolf genre, and many of it's myths and traditions come from this film. The use of silver to stop the werewolf, the Full Moon needed to inspire the transformation, the on-screen transformation and many more come from this one film. Almost every film that has followed it use many of the same rules in differing amounts of accuracy, but it's all from this one. Being the first is considerably important. For it's time, the make-up and transformations are quite interesting. Although not like more recent transformations, this one used more trickery and lighting to get away with the illusion. It really must've freaked out audiences back then, as it looks like a terrifying combo of man and wolf, as the title demonstrates. I was also very impressed with the unusually high amount of great scenes in here. The initial attack is a great mood-setter, with the fog, dim lighting and rapid fire action. It's a great way to introduce the threat of the creature later on in the movie. The other attacks are just as creepy, with the final assault being the real clincher. It's widely know, so I won't spoil it, but it does have it's great share of surprises along the way as well. Once the attacks start, it gets so much better, as it's suspense goes up and the action gets more interesting.The Bad News: There is really only two things I want to get on this film about, and it's about the same thing. Firstly, the reluctant werewolf angle is just not scary. It needs to conjure a sense of dread in the viewer about a vicious creature that wants it's "curse," so to speak. If they have the "curse," then it become a creature different from man, and if they attack a person, then that puts a certain fear into me that I need to get into the story. By then saying that the man who is the creature doesn't want it, then I don't feel as afraid of him as I would be if it was just something that was going to tear my throat out and not care about it. Also, a vicious creature that kills his victims by strangling them isn't all that threatening.The Final Verdict: This isn't called a classic for nothing. If you can forgive a few mistakes against the werewolf, this is a pretty enjoyable film. All classic horror fans should look into this immediately, and all werewolf fans should give this a spin, as it practically invented the genre and established many of it's rules and traditions.Today's Rating-PG: Violence</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Classic Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Between the absolutely perfect atmosphere the movie is set in and the stunning lead performance by Lon Chaney, Jr., "The Wolf Man" has to be ranked as one of the classic horror movies of all time. I fully appreciated Chaney's take on Larry Talbot. Talbot comes to his homeland as an outsider, having been away for many years. Acceptance - even by his own father - is difficult because of some strains within the family, but strangely enough a series of killings begins in the area shortly after he arrives. In the first, Talbot is bitten by a creature he claims to be a wolf. Of course, it was a werewolf, and Talbot faces the inevitable. ( I was intrigued that the werewolf in the first attack looked like a real wolf, whereas Talbot became truly a "wolfman" hybrid. Of course, he was told earlier in the story that a man might become a wolf - or worse. Talbot obviously got the worse!) Having said that, this was far more of a character study of Talbot himself, which made the movie far more interesting, and still frightening at times when the attacks happen. Werewolf movies of today tend to rely far too heavily on makeup, blood and gore. (The only modern werewolf movie I can think of that placed far more emphasis on the character than the monster, and that had little blood and gore is probably 1994's "Wolf," starring Jack Nicholson.) Talbot is as a result one of the more interesting "monsters" of the classic era. Think of the others. Dracula was no object of sympathy. Frankenstein's monster and the mummy were both really innocent. The closest comparison to the Wolf Man might be Jekyll and Hyde (the idea of evil vs good living within one man) but in that story, one can't feel too much sympathy for Jekyll. He did it to himself by his experiments. Here, Talbot (and the viewers) truly does deal with the evil vs good conflict. Talbot seems to be a good, decent man and is completely innocent - he gets bitten trying bravely to defend a woman being attacked. The Wolf Man, on the other hand, is undeniably evil - associated in the movie with the devil. That makes Chaney's performance as Talbot especially impressive, as he portrays Talbot becoming more and more aware of what's happening and also more and more helpless to do anything about it. None of this is his fault, but he can't stop it. The actual monster doesn't play a huge role in the story - he's only featured in 3 or 4 scenes. It's Talbot's plight that the story is about, and it's portrayed fabulously.A pretty decent supporting cast (including a basic cameo by Bela Lugosi as the Gypsy Bela, Maria Ouskenskaya as the old Gypsy woman, Claude Rains as Sir John Talbot, Larry's father, and Evelyn Ankers as his love interest Gwen) helps the story move along quite nicely - although Rains and Chaney are a difficult combination to accept as father and son - but this is truly Chaney's show, and he's brilliant in it. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It isn't a wolf... it's a werewolf!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's only one thing to love about 'The Wolf Man (1941),' it is the atmosphere. In the dead of night, our characters stalk through the silent forest, a delicate layer of mist blanketing the ground, the air swathed in fog, the unseen Moon above offering more than enough light for one to easily navigate the labyrinth of trees. It's scenes like this that provide the iconic essence of Universal Picture's horror movies, in addition to the odd Gothic castle in which a lot of the horror unfolds. 'The Wolf Man,' along with 'Frankenstein (1931)' and 'Dracula (1931),' is among the most influential horror movies of all time, having forever altered public conception of the werewolf legend. Much like the numerous versions of 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' {my favourite being the 1920 film with John Barrymore}, 'The Wolf Man' deals with the duality of man, and how evil (embodied in the form of a deadly beast) can lurk in the soul of even the kindest gentleman.Lon Chaney, Jr. plays Larry Talbot, who returns to his home town of Llanwelly, Wales after an eighteen year absence. His father, Sir John Talbot (the ever-reliable Claude Rains), is proud to have his only surviving son back home, and hopes that Larry may take control of the respected Talbot estate after his death. Following his return, Larry is drawn towards a beautiful local girl, Gwen Conliffe (Evelyn Ankers), who is already engaged to another young man. However, the story takes a devastating turn when Gwen's friend Jenny (Fay Helm) is attacked and killed by a wolf, and, in the ensuing struggle, Larry kills the creature but is himself wounded. An elderly Gypsy woman (Maria Ouspenskaya) reveals to Larry that he has been bitten by a werewolf, the creature-form of her son Bela (Bela Lugosi), and that he is now doomed to prowl the forest as a wolf "when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright."'The Wolf Man' runs for only 70 minutes, and so the story itself is quite simple and concise, ensuring a fast-moving pace that never lacks in intrigue or excitement. Larry's first transformation into the Wolf Man comes surprisingly late in the film, and I perhaps would have liked more scenes with him as a wolf, though perhaps the arduous process of applying Chaney's make-up (six hours to apply, and three hours to remove) would have proved too much a burden on both the actor and the make-up artist, Jack P. Pierce. It is somewhat peculiar that Lugosi's Bela transforms into a complete wolf, and yet Larry retains his humanoid form, but I've heard at least one reasonable explanation offered: it takes many moons before a man can completely become a werewolf at night. Bela, having presumably suffered the affliction for a long time, had long become assimilated into his canine form, but the "inexperienced" Larry must, in the meantime, settle for a hybrid of both man and wolf. This theory might also explain why Larry, as the Wolf Man, can be seen trying to strangle his victims to death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"There's something very tragic about that man"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So says one of the characters in "The Wolf Man," and they're right: Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney), heir to a prestigious estate, is an easygoing, nice guy. He flirts with local shopkeep Gwen (Evelyn Ankers), and, one fateful night, is bitten by a werewolf. Let the interweaving threads of superstition, religion, and psychology commence! A full decade after "Frankenstein" shows Universal's formula for success in full swing, with an end product that is arguably better (and somehow even more tragic). I've never been a big werewolf fan (I think "The Howling" is one of the most overrated horror films ever), but Chaney's tragic downfall mixed with a good deal of insight and sympathy makes for a brilliantly realized performance. Claude Rains ("The Invisible Man") and Ralph Bellamy ("Rosemary's Baby") provide strong support as Larry's father and the town constable, respectively. And Bela Lugosi (as a gypsy named Bela) is fantastic in a small yet crucial role. Curt Siodmak's original screenplay crafts a convincing mythology that has since become the industry standard, and George Waggner's direction renders its German-Expressionist cues with fog-heavy style and skill. "The Wolf Man" is an excellent piece of work that holds up extremely well today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beer, Beer Nuts, and Horror Movies on Saturday Nights.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had wanted to see this movie since I was ten years old and didn't get a chance until I was about thirty. This movie started a weekend tradition between my brother-in-law and I. One Saturday night, we split a six-pack of beer between us (we were both novice drinkers, so it didn't take much to get us four sheets to the wind.) When the hour got late, I looked in the TV Guide to see what was on, and low and behold, it was THE WOLF MAN. So, we watched it. I believe it was the first time for both of us.You can't help but feel for Lon Chaney Jr.'s character. Although he hates what he is, it doesn't take long for his survival instincts to kick in and tries to cover his tracks as much as he can while he is in human form, from wiping mud off the floor, to blood off the windowsill, etc. When he's caught in that bear trap, he looks for a moment as if he is going to cry. And when he is killed at the end, you don't know whether to feel sad or relieved. In human form, Larry Talbot was a likable character.I have this movie on DVD now, as part of the Wolf Man Legacy Collection. But every time I see this movie, it makes me think of the beginning of a short-lived tradition my brother-in-law and I started the first time I saw it; drinking beer and eating beer nuts while watching horror movies on Saturday nights. It lasted until he left the area about a year later. Great memories, great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the first minute of the movie, the list of actors reads Lon Chaney Jr. as "The Wolf Man". Even the opening credits show no mercy. "The Wolf Man" should not just be considered one of the great horror movies, but as one of the best movies of all-time.It basically gives us the message of how someone not only can have two sides to themselves, but can also be victims of that very same duality. The character of Lawrence Talbot, however, isn't a bad guy. In fact he has all of this happen to him because he did what he thought was right.Lon Chaney Jr. does a good job portraying the victim, and the monster, at the same time. I recommend this to any one who is in to films that are not only entertaining, but beautiful and dramatic as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lon Chaney, Junior as Lawrence Talbot: I thought that Lon Chaney, Junior did a great job as Lawrence Stewart 'Larry' Talbot. All of us wanted The Wolf Man dead, but when Sir John Talbot did kill The Wolf Man, we all felt sorry for both him and Sir John. Lon Chaney, Junior would play this roll six more times before his death: Five times in the movies, and once on "Route 66".Claude Rains as Sir John Talbot: Claude Rains was a fantastic actor with an incredible voice. Known for playing Jack Griffin/The Invisible One is James Whales' "The Invisible Man" (1933), Claude Rains did a great job as Larry Talbot's father. Rains' character tries to convince his son that this, in his words, "werewolf nonsense", is all in his head. The scene where he and The Wolf Man fight is truly a heart-pounding and sad finish to this great film.The Film In Whole: This movie is a fun monster flick that will entertain you time and time again. Some people would say "An American Werewolf in London" (1981) was better, but they'd be dead wrong. "The Wolf Man" (1941) captured the hearts of the viewers, something "Werewolf of London" (1935) and "An American Werewolf in London" (1981) didn't do.I give this film a 9/10; a truly great piece of early horror cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the Universal Classic Horror movies of the 1940's and it still is fun to watch.Lon Chaney plays the poor victim/werewolf Larry Talbot with just the right amount of sadness and vulnerability. He infuses the role with confusion and despair, it is truly good acting. His later roles were caricatures of this role and as he evidently sank into alcoholism his roles became more and more ridiculous.Claude Rains plays his very British father, Sir John very well as well. It is never really explained why Larry has such an American accent (we are told he has been in America for a number of years but still this is still not fully explored). Evelyn Ankers plays the lovely daughter of the local antiques dealer whom Larry tries to win but loses to his werewolf-ism.There is plenty of fog and spooky atmosphere to go around. Bela Lugosi has a small supporting role as Bela the Gypsy who is also a werewolf who bites Larry and turns him into a werewolf.A great old horror movie to watch on a rainy night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give the wolf man a nine out of ten. Almost everything about the movie has been right for me since I first saw it at age 5 back in 1958. My older sister used to let me stay up with her on Saturday nights to watch the horror movies and this one was my favorite. I have a copy of it and still watch it occasionally. I plan to show it to my grandchildren in a couple of years,just like I showed it to my kids when they were young. They weren't particularly thrilled with it, however, because they prefer computer graphics to acting. Any adult I've ever shown it to though has appreciated it for all the qualities that most people agree make it a horror classic and a well made picture, especially considering the limited time and budget the makers had to work with. Some things made the movie seem somewhat uneven for me though, even as a child as I recall.First of all, how does Larry Talbot start out on the night of his first transformation wearing a sleeveless t shirt and end up waking the next morning with a dark brown cuffed shirt on? This werewolf did not maintain enough human qualities( as did Wilfred Glendon in Werewolf of London) such that he could decide upon putting on a shirt after he had transformed. Why was Bela Lugosi's werewolf character a big dog but Talbot's was a half human beast that walked on two feet? All in all, these are relatively minor matters and I'm sure that the makers of the movie had their reasons for why these confusing tidbits were allowed to make it to wrap. I suppose in the case of Lugosi's dog like werewolf character, it would have ruined the surprise if he got to be a werewolf similar in appearance to Chaney's.I'll still never understand that sleeveless t shirt thing though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the classic movie monsters, the werewolf and/or wolfman has always been my favorite--with THE WOLF MAN remaining my favorite of the classic Universal Big Three.In his signature role, Lon Chaney Jr. plays Larry Talbot, who returns home to his father's estate in Europe after being away in America for 18 years. During the night of a full moon, Larry accompanies Gwen Conliffe and her friend Jenny to a gypsy carnival, where a fortune teller--Bela Lugosi, in an all too brief cameo--sees the mark of the pentagram in Jenny's palm and later attacks her. Larry--trying to save her--kills what he thinks is a plain, ordinary wolf &amp; is bitten in the process. Thus beginning the tragic saga of the Wolf Man.The rolling fog seen throughout this movie makes for great atmosphere &amp; the musical score is terrific. Chaney excels in his role of Larry Talbot--a very likable, and simultaneously tragic figure. At the start of the movie, we learn that Larry stayed away from his native home for so many years because of his feelings of neglect--due to his older brother getting all of his father's attention. And now that Larry's been more or less "Americanized", he feels like a stranger in his own homeland. That little wolf bite he receives further escalates his troubles. Then there's Claude Rains as Larry's dad. His eldest son is already dead, and he's not reunited with Larry for a whole week before not only losing him, but being the cause of his son's death. There's just tragedy all around in The Wolf Man. Lending great support to this picture is Maria Ouspenskaya as the wise, old gypsy woman who becomes a substitute mother figure to Larry here and in the sequel "Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film, odd to see Ralph Bellamy in the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is surprising how many well known actors are in this film, it is not one of those films with obscure actors, 3 of the cast have been Academy Award nominees by the time this film was made. One of those is Ralph Bellamy, very odd to see him in this film considering his roles in previous films of His Girl Friday and the Awful Truth. Lon Chaney Jr plays a great part and he was quite an adequate actor, just look at his Lennie in Of Mice and Men. Claude Rains plays the father of Larry Talbot with his usual style but I think the real star in this film was Maria Ouspenskaya who played the wizened Gypsy Maleva. Bela Lugosi was reduced to a cameo role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Good As FRANKENSTEIN and Dracula, but still a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, so I was a tad bit disappointed in this movie. Not because it was a bad film, but because my expectations were too high. I bought the Universal Monster Collection, which came with the FRANKENSTEIN SERIES, the Dracula SERIES, and THE WOLF MAN SERIES. I had already seen FRANKENSTEIN, and I knew that it was a true classic. Then I watched Dracula for the first time, and I loved it almost as much as I loved Frankenstein, then I saw THE WOLF MAN?What I saw, was a very good movie. Good enough to call a classic, but, once again, I was very disappointed because it was not as good as the first two films. I had heard that The Wolf Man, Frankenstein, and Dracula were all in about the same league, three classic universal films, so I guess when I watched The Wolf Man I was expecting another Frankenstein or Wolf Man, anyway, on with the film.So we have Larry Tate. Larry Tate has not talked to his father in years. Well, one day, Larry's brother is shot down in a terrible hunting accident. So Larry goes to his father's town, at his father's mansion, and stays with him for a little while.While at his father's home, he meets a woman, who he is very attracted to. So he takes her out, to get they're fortune read with one of the woman's friends. Well anyway, the woman's friend ends up getting attacked by a wolf. Larry runs to her rescue, and ends up killing the wolf, but not before the woman is killed, and Larry ends up getting a terrible bite in the process of killing this beast.But not very long after, we come to find out that it was not your average wolf that Larry killed. It was a werewolf, and now that Larry has been bit, he is going to turn into a werewolf himself!Now don't get me wrong, just because I was disappointed in this movie does not mean that you will. Just don't get your expectations too high. It is a very good movie, with some very shocking moments. Just don't be expecting to see another Frankenstein or Dracula. Now quit reading things online and go pick up the Universal Monster Box Set!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****************"Even the man who is pure in heart ***************** *******************and says his prayers by night******************** ***********may become a wolf when the wolf bane blooms************** ******************and the autumn moon is bright"*********************Lycanthropy, werewolfism, pentagrams, wolf bane, gypsies, curses and fortune felling are all highlighted in the 1941 movie "The Wolf Man." And what a delight it all is. First rate acting from a terrific cast and a well written Curt Siodomak screenplay elevate this chiller to a notch above many other early movies of the horror film genre. The "Wolf Man" creates its own eerie world in which it is easy to imagine that such a thing as werewolves do exist. ******************Warning...Contians Mild Spoilers********************** Larry Tolbert (Lon Chaney Jr.) returns home to his father, Sir John Tolbert (Claude Rains), and Tolbert Castle near a quaint little village after eighteen years in America. Gypsies come to town and things get hairy because Bela, (Bela Lugosi), turns out to be under the curse of the wolf. He attacks and kills Jenny (Fay Helm), a friend of Gwen Conliffe (Evelyn Ankers). Larry is bitten by the wolf during the attack on Jenny. Police Captain Muntford (Ralph Bellamy) recruits the men of the town in the hunt for Jenny's killer. Soon the wolf man strikes again and the townsfolk are buzzing about the killings. The mother (Maria Ouspenskaya) of Bela the Gypsy warns Larry that whoever is bitten by a werewolf and lives becomes a werewolf himself. In fear, she and the other gypsies flee because there is a werewolf in their camp. The legend of the werewolf comes to life in this highly entertaining film that propels itself forward toward its inevitable conclusion for Larry Tolbert who has become the "Wolf Man." This film is so rich in atmosphere that it draws you into the story. A foggy night in the forest, a spooky graveyard, an eerie crypt, a huge three hundred year old castle and a quaint little village set the stage for the strange goings on. Meticulous detail shows in all the scenes of this film. The one glaring shortcoming of "The Wolf Man" is the low budget quality of the wolf attack on Jenny and the disappointingly amateur special effects utilized to portray the wolf man. Modern audiences will no doubt chuckle at them rather than be frightened by them. Still, that is not enough to detract one from absorption into the charming story presented to us in this unique and special 1941 werewolf movie. 85/100 points. Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a kid I loved horror flicks...but the much praised Universal flicks always disappointed me. I would finally be able to stay up late enough, or randomly catch, one of these movies, only to find they were slow, boring, poorly acted. The Wolfman was the exception. The best of the Universal flicks I still enjoy watching it "when the autumn moon is bright". Lon Chaney Jr. is passable as the sap; Lugosi and the old gypsy woman are creepy as hell and Claude Rains, who is always enjoyable, gives a great performance as the concerned father. I highly recommend this movie if one wants to see a classic horror flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Literary, horrifying, serious but not self-serious classic with well-written dialogue, a compact structure and splendid supporting performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bride of Frankenstein" is the greatest Universal Horror film and my second favorite; but my favorite is this literary, horrifying, serious but not self-serious classic with its well-written dialogue, compact structure, splendid supporting performances (especially by Claude Rains, Maria Ouspenskaya and, in a bit, Bela Lugosi) and beautifully composed images filled with fog and shadows. The inestimable Jack Pierce delivers a terrifying makeup job for the title character. The wonderful music score has cues that are as unpredictable as they are psychologically acute. Just as strange, and strangely satisfying, is the dream sequence that appears unexpectedly, yet in the perfect place; and it feels integral to the film, not something thrown in for effect. When the moving image of Larry Talbot suddenly dissolves into a still image we feel disoriented, like Talbot himself.Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney, Jr.) is the prodigal son. He returns from America to his father, Sir John Talbot (Rains), in Wales after the accidental death of his older brother. Sir John proposes to his son that they end the family tradition of stiff-necked reserve by having a close and affectionate relationship. Both Talbots are hard-headed realists, though the father seems more intellectual and more willing to entertain abstract concepts. But it's the younger who, while taking a hopeful late-night walk with someone else's fiancée (Evelyn Ankers), is bitten by a werewolf. It's the younger who must suffer the torments of transforming into a wolflike creature "when the autumn moon is bright" and must take seriously the warnings of an old gypsy woman (Ouspenskaya), whom the elder dismisses as a superstitious prattler.The theme of the monstrous id being unleashed is just as effectively and memorably handled as in the 1931 Paramount version of Robert Louis Stevenson's "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," although this id has nothing on its mind but the rabid desire to kill. Aside from tiny flaws?like the abrupt ending?the only serious defect for me is the half-miscast Chaney. I say "half" because he's fine as a tormented soul; but in the scene where he woos Ankers in her antique shop with playful banter he betrays his limitations. Chaney?who was well cast as Lenny in "Of Mice and Men"?is not a leading man, either in looks or in acting ability. In scenes like this, he always seems like a star football player taking up acting for the first time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true Horror classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So here it is, the movie that sparked Hollywood's interest in werewolves throughout the 1940's -- an interest that has been revived again and again throughout the decades. But has it stood the test of time, compared to other classics of it's genre? Well, the first impression you get is that it's not exactly subtle ... Talbot arrives back in Wales and has hardly begun to explore the town before the locals are bombarding him with werewolf folklore and selling him a silver walking stick with a wolf's head and a pentagram on it. This was, of course, necessary though as the cinema audience may not be aware of the myth surrounding the idea of a man who can transform into a wolf. He is then bitten by a wolf and begins to transform, of course at first he doesn't believe it's happening, but slowly he becomes convinced. And exactly the same thing has been happening in werewolf movies ever since -- "No, I can't be ... it's not possible ... alright, maybe it is ... okay, so I'm a werewolf." All around the performances are great -- Claude Rains as Talbot's father is excellent, the supporting cast are convincing, Bela Lugosi shines in his brief cameo, and above all Chaney himself has some memorably, emotionally-loaded scenes. The set pieces look fantastic, especially those misty forest scenes which have gone down in horror history. The thing that makes this a superior werewolf to anything that came before, and much of what came after for the next forty years, is not the makeup but Chaney's own animalistic performance.In my opinion, this movie is at least on the same level as Universal's previous adaptations of Dracula and Frankenstein, and this is especially impressive considering this is the only one not based on a previous work of literature. We have Curt Siodmak to thank for the story, who wrote a brilliant original screenplay with good dialogue and sympathetic characters.This is a movie that fans of the genre will come back to time and time again, regardless of it's age. The original and definitely among the best, "The Wolf Man" still stands proud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Wolf Man' is a likable but completely unremarkable addition to the Universal horror stable, joining such luminaries as Dracula, The Invisible Man and Frankenstein in the hall of monster fame (and sharing with them the dubious honour of meeting the universe-implodingly unfunny Abbott and Costello). With such transparent effects as pentagram scars drawn on in pencil crayon and werewolf transformations that simply dissolve from a pair of bare legs to a pair of hairy ones, this isn't exactly the most sophisticated movie, even for its time.Lon Chaney is Larry Talbot, who returns to the family home and meets up with his father (Claude Rains) after many years. While trying to woo local girl Gwen (Evelyn Ankers), Larry visits a gypsy fortune teller (Bela Lugosi) who promptly transforms into a wolf, kills a woman and bites Larry on the chest. As the legend goes, anyone who is bitten by a werewolf shall become one themselves, and so pretty soon Larry finds himself the possessor of fur all over his body, sharp teeth, and a desire to run about in the woods at night and attack people.'The Wolf Man' lays on the werewolf mythology a bit thick, opening with an unconvincing dictionary definition of lycanthropy (luckily including a brief passage about the strange reputation of Talbot Castle, which is pretty pointless since the wolfy stuff is started by the gypsy), following that up with three separate characters reciting the same 'Even a man who is pure in heart...' poem about the curse of the werewolf, and trundling through numerous wolf references like the silver head on Larry's cane and the wolfbane in the forest.I think my favourite part was the completely irony-free bit where a priest tells the old gypsy woman (Maya Ouspenskaya) planning a pagan funeral ceremony for her son, 'Fighting superstition is as hard as fighting Satan himself!' Right oh, then! Silly old gypsies and their superstitious ways! Anyway, there's not much chemistry between the actors: Chaney and Ankers don't convince as a possible couple, and Chaney and Rains don't convince as father and son, although they're all right taken on their own. Carried by its status as one of the famous monster movies in the Universal pantheon, 'The Wolf Man' is actually pretty darn run-of-the- mill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still effective after all these years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember first seeing The Wolf Man when I was 8 11 years ago, and being quite unnerved. Now it doesn't as much, but the atmosphere is still there and I can also appreciate the film for its other successful components. The film may look dated compared to what's going on today with technology to some, but I personally think for its time The Wolf Man is well made and when I watch it today I think the production values have their charm. The sets and costumes are highly atmospheric, and the make up is exceptional. The music is also chilling, the direction is fine, the script is intelligent and literate and the plot captivates. The performances are excellent too, Maria Ouspenskaya and Bela Lugosi are great, Claude Rains is superb and Lon Chaney Jnr gives a very sympathetic and believable performance in the title role. The only qualms that I have with this movie are its rather short length and one or two scenes in the middle that drag. Other than that, it is a very effective and atmospheric film. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lon Chaney makes his father proud...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lon Chaney, the lead character, is the son of Lon Chaney Sr. Without a doubt one of the greatest and important actors who ever lived. He was the star of Phantom of the Opera and so many other silent classics. And his son walks on in his footsteps. And he's doing great as well, too bad he was always overshadowed by his father maybe. Chaney Jr. was easily capable of carrying a whole movie and he sure played his share of classic monsters. In this film of course, the Wolf man but also Kharis the Mummy, the Son of Dracula and many others...And the famous Universal line surely fits here in this movie. A great cast is worth repeating. Other than Chaney, this movie also stars Claude Rains (the amazing actor from the Invisible Man and surely one of my favorites...) and a brief appearance by Bela Lugosi as well. Put these 3 names in one film and you got a masterpiece, I assure you. The story is about Larry Talbot returning to his home town after a long time of absence. His father Sir John is the most respected citizen there and because of that, Larry is famous there too. When he's walking late at night with Gwen ( a local beauty who owns a watch shop ) he's attacked by a wolf. Larry manages to kill the creature, but a strange gypsy woman comes to tell his that now HE shall become a werewolf when the moon is full. He shall know his next victim when he sees a pentagram in their hand...After a few mysterious nights, Larry has to believe what the lady said and he wants to run before do causes any more disasters. His father and Gwen on the other hand want him to stay and they can't believe Larry is causing all the terror... I love horror. Especially classic horror movies and the ultimate icons in horror for me are...werewolves. So, you can imagine how I loved this film and I'm sure most people will love it as well. There's a good amount of suspense in this film so all genre lovers will like it. Fans of the early days of cinema will enjoy it a lot as well. The make-up effects are decent but not very impressive. I'm aware of the fact that this movie was made in 1941, buy by then movies with better make-up had already been made. Like The Invisible man or the Mummy for example. But don't let that spoil the fun, like I said they are decent enough to live the movie completely. Highly recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the Universal horror films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the monster movies I grew up with (via television) back in the 1950s and 1960s, this version of the Wolfman saga was always my favorite. In my view it out-shined the earlier Universal monster movies, in part because of when it made -- 1941 -- 10 years after "Frankenstein" and "Dracula", and 9 years after "The Mummy". Movies had advanced tremendously in that decade, so the quality of the technical aspects of the film are so much better than the others mentioned. Another reason I preferred this film is that it has a genuine movie star who was well recognized as a fine actor -- Claude Rains. Rains was in his most productive period when this film was made...just a year before he was the main supporting actor in "Casablanca".My review here is of the Blu Ray edition which recently came out. Is it worth upgrading? Yes. This is a wonderful transfer with remarkably clean video.One of the biggest flaws in this film is not being able to see Lon Chaney as the son of Claude Rains. I like them both as actors, but that just doesn't work. But setting that aside, it's a very good film. Production quality seemed quite high, and some of the atmospheric sets were especially good, particularly toward the end of the film. The film is short -- just 70 minutes -- but that keeps the drama and suspense up through the film. There are no slow sequences here, as there were in "The Mummy".Perhaps the film's strong suit is the cast. Lon Chaney, Jr. was a talented actor. Perhaps not handsome enough to be a leading man, in this type of role he excelled. Unfortunately, as the years passed he became more and more an alcoholic, but particularly in the various Wolfman films, he did a fine job, as he did in a number of other films. Later in life, as alcohol took its toll, his ability to perform diminished, but he's very good here as Larry Talbot/The Wolf Man.Claude Rains was an already accomplished actor when he played Larry Talbot's father. He adds a touch of class to the film.Warren William as Dr. Lloyd wasn't a character actor I always appreciated, but he did a very nice job here. As did a young Ralph Bellamy as a slightly stuffy leader of the community. Patric Knowles was good as a rival love interest (along with Lon Chaney) for Evelyn Ankers, who also does a very nice job in this film. Unfortunately, her career seemed pretty much downhill after this film.Of course, Maria Ouspenskaya gets a lot of attention as the gypsy who knows all about werewolves, although I'm not convinced it's as good a performance, albeit a memorable one. This is the only film I ever say Béla Lugosi in (here as the gypsy fortune teller and werewolf who infects Chaney); it's the only performance of his I ever enjoyed...albeit short...he fairly quickly bites the dust.Yes, this is the best of the Universal monster movies, and I recommend it. It was a memorable film for me when I was growing up. A very strong "7".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lon Chaney Jr Set the Stage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wolfman (1941): Dir: George Waggner / Cast: Lon Chaney Jr., Evelyn Ankers, Claude Rains, Maria Ouspenskaya, Bela Lugosi: One of the innovators of werewolf movies. It seems to reference our inner animal in terms of mental behavior often explained away in courts. Lon Chaney Jr plays Larry Talbot who arrives home after news of his brother's death. One of the film's initial problems is the often talked about plot. In this case, werewolves are discussed too much, as if the characters are in of the joke. Talbot is eventually bitten and struggles with behavior and grisly murders that he cannot fathom ever committing to. Chaney's transformation into a werewolf is done through trick photography and the makeup looks fine, but he is at his best when struggling with his affliction. Evelyn Ankers plays a woman he meets as a jewelry store whom becomes his romantic interest and obvious potential victim. Claude Rains plays Talbot's father who sees his son as using mad accusations about himself until he is faced with only one choice. Maria Ouspenskaya plays a gypsy woman who warns Talbot of his curse and later frees him from a trap set by villagers. Bela Lugosi appears briefly in a pivotal role as a gypsy turned werewolf whom Talbot slays after being bitten. This is a well crafted monster film referencing mental stability and the struggle against our inner animal. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Featuring another one of movie cinema's classic monsters, this is the first original film featuring the Wolf Man/Werewolf. Lon Chaney Jr. plays the title character, turning into a wolf man and being bitten by another. Then, all those around him are in danger of his bewitching wrath.The acting was great in the film and you see a sense of dread and fear when Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.) realizes he might be turning into a werewolf. Evelyn Ankers gave the film added drama and emotion as female lead Gwen Conliffe.There's a bit of suspense toward the beginning of the film and the music score is effective for a classic horror movie. But, much of the plot suffers from very limited appearances of the actual Wolf Man and missing iconic references to the creature (i.e., howling at night, baying at the moon, transforming at a full moon, etc). At 70 minutes, this is a film with few twists and turns and few action oriented sequences.Overall, it's an OK horror classic - an average film.Grade C+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shame to say but it took me too long to see this classic although I have had this DVD-box for a long time. I'd say that The Wolf Man is not as good as Frankenstein but it's better than Dracula. In my opinion, Dracula is pretty much overrated movie. It's OK, nothing more.Sometimes it's a good thing that movies are short (this is less than one hour and ten minutes) but then again sometimes you need more flesh over the bones and in this case I think that movie could have been better with extra 30 minutes or something like that. With more concentrating in characters and developing their nature it could have been more touching result. Now you really don't care that much what happens to Lon Chaney's character, it is not just tragic enough! Also relationship with Talbot and Gwen Conliffe is pretty lame. Well, it's already quite hard enough to believe the Conliffe would fall for Talbot instead of much more handsome dude Frank Andrews. And you've got to admit that the Wolf Man's mask is nowadays more funny than scary or threatening.. :) I believe that it worked in 1940's but today...But all in all, The Wolf Man is quite a good movie and I would recommend it to Universal monster -fans (of course they all have seen this already) and horror movie and movie history -fanatics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Released while the USA was being attacked at Pearl Harbor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was never a worse box office weekend. Wolf Man had it's Hollywood premier on Dec. 9 1941 for the one-night only. The USA wide release was Dec 12. 1941. Pearl Harbor was attacked on Dec 11, 1941. This attack put the USA into World War II in a big way. America was not prepared for such a shock. Still, Wolf Man became a cultural icon during this time. When people were quick to judge how Americans returned to normal following the World Trade Center attacks, it is interesting that kids turned to the monster icons in 1941 and probably caught less trouble about not showing grief. Teens still were being drafted, still respected the USA, parents. Maybe they understood more about Balance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good B-Movie but I enjoyed it as more of a thriller than a horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the remake imminent, I watched the original to see why it's endured all these years.The acting is definitely theatrical and melodramatic as expected from the period, though Chaney Jr is very sympathetic as the Wolf Man who is put upon with this curse. He also has palatable chemistry with his love interest Ankers. Ankers is fine as the damsel in distress and Rains is delivers a solid performance as the Wolf Man's dad, but it is a bit comical how short he is compared to Chaney Jr. The gypsy woman is obviously a stereotype and could've been developed more.The plot does have some symbolism and is fairly swiftly paced, but it doesn't really have that creepy atmosphere for what's being classed as a horror film - it's more a thriller about fate. The makeup and costume for The Wolf Man looks more gorilla than werewolf, to me.The score is suitably dramatic is a bit too OTT at certain 'kill' scenes it can be quite overpowering.Overall: A good effort for the time and presents some interesting ideas on lycanthropy but lacks that atmosphere, thrills and development that could've improved it. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Even a man who is pure at heart, and says his prayers by night, may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the birth of the motion picture industry, the horror film has always encountered varying degrees of success with audiences. But an undeniable peak period for the genre was the thirties when Universal created a number of memorable screen monsters FRANKENSTEIN (1931), Dracula (1931) and THE MUMMY, (1932.) The Forties, on the other hand, was a low point that saw a trend toward low-budget programmers and uninspired sequels that culminated in a parody of the genre, Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948). There were a few high points, however, such as the atmospheric thrillers of Val Lewton (Cat People, 1942, The Body Snatcher, 1945). And the most popular horror film of the entire decade - The Wolf Man (1941), directed by George Waggner - added yet another frightening creature to Universal's gallery of monsters.Like Universal's earlier exploration of lycanthropy, WEREWOLF OF London (1935), Waggner's film drew upon European folklore and legends for inspiration and screenwriter Curt Siodmak fashioned an increasingly paranoid narrative around an American, Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney, Jr.), returning to his father's estate in England after an eighteen-year absence.According to the documentary on the Recent Wolf Man DVD collection, the script for The Wolf Man was influenced by writer Curt Siodmak's experiences in Nazi Germany. Siodmak had been living a normal life in Germany only to have it thrown into chaos and himself on the run when the Nazis took control, just as Larry Talbot finds his normal life thrown into chaos and himself on the run once he is turned into a werewolf. Also, the wolfman himself can be seen as a metaphor for the Nazis: an otherwise good man who is transformed into a vicious killing animal who knows who his next victim will be when he sees the symbol of a pentagram (i.e., a star) on them."Even a man who is pure at heart, and says his prayers by night, may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright." This quote has been listed in some sources as an authentic Gypsy or Eastern European folk saying. Writer Curt Siodmak admits that he simply made it up. Nonetheless, the rhyme would be recited in every future Universal film appearance of the Wolf Man, and would also be quoted in Van Helsing (2004). Lon Chaney Jr.'s make-up took six hours to apply, and three hours to get off. Jack Pierce, meticulously added yak hair, fangs, a rubber snout and other uncomfortable features to Chaney's face and body. The actor didn't exactly enjoy the process and once complained, "What gets me is after work when I'm hot and itchy and tired, and after I've got to sit in that chair for forty-five minutes while Pierce just about kills me, ripping off the stuff he put on me in the morning." Lon Chaney, Jr., son of the famous silent actor who specialized in grotesque characters and masochistic melodramas, was not yet known as a horror film actor when he was offered the lead role in The Wolf Man. Previously he had enjoyed some critical success as the retarded Lennie in both the stage play and the 1939 film version of John Steinbeck's OF MICE AND MEN but it wasn't until he starred in MAN MADE MONSTER (1941) for director George Waggner that he began to gravitate toward horror roles. Maria Ouspenskaya, who played the old Gypsy woman, was only six years older than Bela Lugosi, who played her son.Evelyn Ankers had a rough time on the set. Lon Chaney Jr. delighted in sneaking up on her in full makeup and scaring her senseless. Even more troublesome than Chaney's behavior was the thick, chemical fog that permeated the set daily and made breathing difficult. For one scene, Ankers had to faint and fall to the misty ground but the fog fumes were so strong she passed out. Unnoticed by the director and crew who were concentrating on another aspect of the scene, she remained there unnoticed until a studio technician began breaking down the set. The "wolf" that Larry Talbot fights with was Lon Chaney Jr.'s own German Shepherd. Patric Knowles who plays the handsome friend of Gwen was last seen in THREE CAME HOME. A surprise hit for Universal, over the years the film's reputation has steadily improved with horror buffs and film scholars noticing the strains of Greek tragedy (the grim trajectory of Talbot's relationship with his domineering father) and old world superstitions that run throughout the movie. The Wolf Man is responsible for establishing the mythology and on-screen representation of werewolf lore that followed in subsequent imitators from the pentagrams to the wolfbane to the full moon transformation scenes. In the end, though, The Wolf Man is Lon Chaney, Jr.'s finest hour, and it's certainly Maria Ouspenskaya's most memorable role as well. -------------------------- Russian actress Maria Ouspenskaya's most memorable role Maleva, the gypsy fortune-teller who shares Talbot's pain, Ouspenskaya's soothing recitations still haunt many a young viewer who saw the film at an impressionable age (in thick accent) "The way you walk was thorny through no fault of your own, but as the rain enters the soil the river enters the sea, so tears run to a predestined end. Your suffering is over. Now you will find peace for eternity."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best known werewolf movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Larry Talbot returns from America to Wales after the death of his brother. While there , he visits a gypsy fortune teller with a woman who is later attacked by a werewolf (the gypsy in wolf form). Larry manages to kill the werewolf but is bitten in the process, which causes him to turn were himself. This of course leads to all sorts of problems and self-loathing.The Wolf Man is a fine movie and rightly praised for its merits. Lon Chaney Jr provides an excellent performance as Larry Talbot/the Wolf Man, (though at times I personally found his character a bit "whiney") and the supporting cast is also good.The story moves along well, and the settings are appropriate. The script has some clever dialog and the characters are built up nicely.But for some reason, this is my least favorite of the big Universal monster pictures. I'm not sure why, except that it doesn't affect me the way that some of the others do. Frankenstein's creature was a very tragic person but still strong and simply misunderstood. Dracula was suave but thoroughly evil. The Creature from the Black Lagoon is just such a beautiful picture. And I love Karloff's portrayal of The Mummy. But while Lon Chaney is tragic as the werewolf, I simply don't have any real emotional connection to his character-maybe because I would have liked to see him stronger in dealing with his affliction. I don't know.But this is still a good movie, worth the time to watch it.</fullReview>

I watched the film with a couple of friends, expecting the film to be down right laughable, however, I was shocked to see that, while it aura of horror did not last, the film would have been considered revolutionary in its time, and the characters in their 1 hour and 10 minutes of time were reasonably well developed. We were not laughing, but actually enjoying this classic masterpiece.

		<shortDescription>A Sheep in Wolf's Clothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wolfman is just a wonderful movie and owes it all to Lon Chaney, Jr. who happens to be a real actor. Bela Lagosi can behave strange and spooky, but he's too "over the top" to be considered a real actor. Karloff as the Mummy and Frankenstein could arguably be said to be as good or better than Cheney, since he could exude pathos with a few grunts and no dialogue. But Cheney can truly act and that is what carries this movie and makes it a classic.Even if the story had nothing to do with a "monster", the Greek tragic style of a good-hearted man compelled to act out his animal passions outside of his control has so many allusions (as the writers here said, to Naziism, but also to anything...hatred, pornography, violence, racism, alcoholism, drug addiction...that seems too much to control. And which, as this movie subtly suggests, is largely inherited. The sheep-eyed giant of a man becoming a wolfish brute is someone we have probably all known sometime in our lives.As strange as it sounds, you truly come to like Larry Talbot and to feel sorry for him and wish he could "get the girl" (other than in the jugular) in the end. No wonder he was my favorite of all my monster collections as a boy (I still remember the Revell plastic model I had of him and using his claws to scratch my back). My we all find the Power to overcome our inner wolf and find peace eternal in the end. Say...I wonder if that scratching made ME a...is that a full moon??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best films ever made where you know there will be tragedy, but you also feel so deeply for the character. No one can deny the horror and the sorrow of this character of the wolf man.Even after all of these years, as you watch the story unfold, you know what's going to happen, you know how it's going to happen, but because of the excellent performance of Lon Cheney, Jr., you still feel for the monster. Not many man turned monster films gets you into the human side of the problem, but this one does.There are no spoilers here, the story is well known: a man goes to his homeland, meets pretty girl, buys wolf cane (how ironic!), gets a gypsy fortune told of impending doom for the man, he is bit by a wolf. Now at the full moon, he turns into this horrid wolf creature - against the kind regular soul he is. Lon Cheney, Jr., pulls off this touched soul magnificently - his face, his emotions all pour onto the screen - when he's not a wolf, and when he turns into the wolf man.This is acting, before CGI - and Lon Cheney, Jr. comes from excellent acting stock to do this, Lon Cheney, the Phantom of the Opera himself. One of the classics, the original, one of the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The curse of the full moon.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Larry Talbot returns from America to his father's castle in Wales after the death of his brother. On the night of his arrival, he and a local girl, Gwen head out to visit a gypsy camp to see the fortune-teller. But when he hears a scream and tries to go to the aid of a young woman being attack by a wolf, Larry is bitten during the killing of the beast. Although, when the police get there they happen to discover the body of the girl and a gypsy. So, now the curse has past onto Larry and now he battles the beast within and learns of the mythology of the thing he becomes when the moon is full from an old gypsy lady. He doesn't pay much attention at first, but when these occurrences start adding up he tries to convince those close that there's something terribly wrong with him.Here comes another infamous monster legend of pure folktale that Universal studio could see becoming part of their classic monster legacy. Joining the ranks of such high profile creations like Frankenstein, Dracula, The Mummy, The Invisible Man and The Creature from the Black Lagoon. What a line-up and 'The Wolf Man' definitely deserves to stand along those titles. These films are great for their progressive, if simple story-telling and dreamy air, and 'The Wolf Man' is no exception to that. I would say that it is more out-of-this-world in its thickly tacked on atmosphere of swirling surroundings like out of some fairytale and the incorporated folktale of tragic fate that awaits the innocently, sympathetic victim is simply eerie. The narration might have bullet holes evident and lack surprises, but its lyrically strong and knows how to pull you into this surreal and Gothic world.Now onto the folktale of the Lycanthrope and it's not totally true to its sources, but its given some influential Hollywood touches that would go on to be the framework for most projects of the sub-genre. Although, it wasn't the first of its kind, as before this there was "Werewolf of London (1935)". But it was this outing that catapulted Lon Chaney Jnr.'s career role as the long-suffering Larry Talbot in follow-up sequels and meetings with well-known characters like "Abbott and Costello". Lon Chaney Jnr brings a charismatic and caring appeal to Larry Talbot and equally as good is Mary Ouspenskaya as the old, gypsy lady Maleva who provides such control in her dialogue and actions. The rest of the distinguishable cast, Claude Rains, Warren William, Ralph Bellamy, Patric Knowles and a small part from Bela Lugosi give fine performances.The production itself is reasonably solid with crisp BW photography, a sophisticated character score that drills away with its chilling embrace and how can I pass on Jack Pierce's primitive make-up that looks dazzling and creates a beast of sheer terror and madness. Well, that if you can pass that campy attitude that would drip from it nowadays. The transformation won't blow you away with its fade out shots, but it was still well done for when it was made. The shaped sets do feel like stage pieces on a Hollywood back lot, but that gives it more a grounded feel and odd sense of honesty. There happens to be some tense build-ups and sound execution by director George Wagner.An everlasting horror item that probably doesn't get enough attention, but it's a classic atmospheric story that sets the rules. Or maybe for some "It's all Greek to me" sums it up perfectly. I'll go with the former.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Title - "The Wolf Man" Year - 1941 Cast - Lon Chaney, Junior; Claude Rains; Bela LugosiLon Chaney, Junior - Chaney's performance in this film is really powerful. It would get a little over-emotional at times, but still a very solid performance. Chaney was the only actor to have played the same character in five different films. I give this performance a...*drum roll*...7/10.Claude Rains - Rains, first made famous by his roll as Jack Griffin/The Invisible One in James Whales' "The Invisible Man", plays Larry Talbot's father, Sir John Talbot. Rains' was a fantastic actor, but he wasn't good enough to convince me that he is the father of Lon Chaney, Jr, who was quite a bit bigger than him when it came to weight and height. This performance was one of his most underrated, in my opinion. I give this performance a...*drum roll*...6.5/10. The special effects - To tell you the truth, the effects in this film weren't very "special". The norm for human-to-animal transformations back then was lap-dissolves. What they would do is sit Chaney down in a chair, shoot a few frames of one stage of make-up, cut, go back to the make-up chair, sit Chaney back down, and shoot some more frames, and combine the two shots together. It was a very sloppy way to do it, but hey, it was the 1940s. Personally, the transformation in "Werewolf in London" was much, much better. I give the special effects a...*drum roll*...5.5/10.The musical score - One of the best horror scores of all time, in my opinion. I mean, this character had its own three-note tune!. Dun dun dun...! I give the musical score a...*drum roll*...8.5/10.My overall rating for this film is...*drum roll*...6.8/10. A very good werewolf film that anybody could enjoy. Fun for all ages.</fullReview>

He gives up his romance (though I always had trouble with his leading man image), and his very being, filled with guilt for what he is through a horrible accident.

But as the rain enters the soil, the river enters the sea, so tears run to a predestined end. Your suffering is over." Unfortunately, this is little comfort; he has had to face the ultimate.

		<shortDescription>Very Hairy, Not So Scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Knowing it is the film that introduced one of horror filmdom's most iconic figures, I watched "The Wolf Man" ready to give it every break. So it was disappointing to discover it both sloppy in its construction and sluggard in its execution.Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney, Jr.) returns home to Talbot Castle after 16 years in America, ready to assume the mantle of heir after the untimely death of his elder brother. The neighboring village offers attractions, like Gwen (Evelyn Ankers) who works at an antique store. But it also holds dangers, like the much-discussed legend of a man who turns into a wolf and attacks people. Larry discovers the truth behind this legend one evening while walking with Gwen."There's something very tragic about that man, and I'm sure nothing but harm will come to you through him," Gwen is told, accurately enough as things turn out.Having seen Chaney play the role in two other films ("Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man" and "Abbott And Costello Meet Frankenstein"), I was expecting a much better performance from him than I got. Especially in his scenes with Ankers and with Claude Rains playing his father, Chaney is awkward and unconvincing, creepy when he should be sympathetic and boring when he should be scary.The film creates a potentially riveting situation and does next to nothing with it. Whether it's the mystery of the dead older brother or the presence of Bela Lugosi as a tense gypsy, the film is full of ideas that are either dropped entirely or else underdeveloped. I'd complain about the downer ending, too, except I felt nothing but relief when "The End" came up.Director George Waggner has no sense of pace. His central concept, the Wolf Man, takes more than half the movie's short running time to get going, and is then over with too quickly. Meanwhile, too much time is spent on dull scene-setting, including a bit of folk verse regarding the wolf-man legend ("Even a man who is pure in heart...") uttered three times in the first 15 minutes. The supporting players seem out to sea, especially Ralph Bellamy, sporting a pipe in place of an accent, and Ankers, whose real-life dislike for Chaney is palpable.Even the much-heralded transformation scenes are not much to watch. The first time, we only see Larry's feet become paws in a series of obvious lap dissolves. Once later we get a close-up of Larry's face in the process, but it hardly seems worth the legendary labor of Jack Pierce. As Tom Weaver says in the DVD commentary track, he looks more at times like Don King than a credible wolf-man.What's good about "The Wolf Man" is the murky ambiance consistent with the Universal monster movies and Rains' solid performance as the stern but caring father. Even when saddled with some howler lines, like urging his son "fight his way out" of his wolf-man delusion or hypothesizing that the werewolf idea is "probably an ancient explanation of the dual personality in each of us," Rains carries off his scenes with aplomb. He's my pick for the Doe Avedon "Best Performance In A Bad Film" award for 1941.The Wolf Man concept deserves some positive notice; it's been used in some very good films. Just not this one.</fullReview>

Students and lovers of cinema will, I'm sure, have some moments a pure joy when seeing the references to German expressionism and the like that are littered throughout this Hollywood money-making exercise.All in all, however, I can't recommend it as a 'must see'. Not as a film in its own right, or even as part of the glorious tradition of laughable horror films.

What is not to like about that? I do not have much to say on this one, as it is obvious this film is a classic for a reason.

		<shortDescription>The Most Tragic of the Universal Studios' Monsters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director George Waggner's "The Wolfman" qualifies as the most tragic of the Universal Studios' monsters. The eponymous protagonist was not the result of an elaborate operation by a blasphemous mad scientist who grafted different body parts together in "Frankenstein" to create a monster. The Wolfman wasn't born to his condition as Count Dracula. The Wolfman didn't create his own woes the same way that victim in "The Invisible Man" did during his experiments with himself. Instead, another wolfman bit Lawrence Talbot and his troubles never ended. Like Dracula, Talbot was cursed since he didn't die in "The Wolfman." Lon Chaney, Jr., reprised the role in "Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman." Unlike all these protagonists, including later the gill man in "Creature from the Black Lagoon," Lawrence Talbot was an ordinary human without a care in the world. Worse, tragedy had already struck in his family with the death of his older brother which prompted him to return to his home. Unfortunately, the make-up looks rather foolish these days. Indeed, it appears as if the Wolfman is wearing a toboggan when his face grows furry. Scenarist Curt Siodmak suffered under the edicts of the Production Code Administration so that some of "The Wolfman" is contrived. When the man metaphorizes into the creature, several parts of his wardrobe have to be discarded, but discarding those crucial garments would have resulted in nudity.After spending 18 years in America, the second Talbot son Lawrence (Lon Chaney, Jr., in his film debut) comes back to the family estate in England. The circumstances surrounding Lawrence's arrival are sad. Lawrence's older brother John, who had inherited everything which is why Lawrence left, has been killed in a hunting accident. We aren't given any details. This reunion between Lawrence and his grief-stricken father Sir John (Claude Rains of "The Invisible Man") is a pleasant one. Larry helps Sir John assemble his new telescope. While adjusting the mechanism, Larry indulges in a bit of innocent voyeurism. As he is scanning the village with the lens, he settles his curious attention on a beautiful young woman, Gwen Conliffe (Evelyn Ankers of "Bachelor Daddy"), who is trying on ear-rings. Later, Lawrence visits her father's shop, buys a silver-handled walking stick mounted with a wolf's head and a pentagram. Incidentally, a pentagram is a five-pointed star. Gwen acquaints him with the folklore surrounding the werewolf, but Lawrence dismisses it as the ravings of an unhinged imagination. Actually, Gwen, Sir John, and Jenny Williams recite the saying about werewolves: "Even a man, who is pure in heart and says his prayers by night, may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon are bright." Anyway, Lawrence persuades Gwen to accompany him to a gypsy camp to amuse themselves. Another villager Jenny Williams (Fay Helm of "Dark Victory") joins them and wants to have her fortune told. The gypsy man who examines the palm of her hand is Bela (Bela Lugosi of "Dracula") and he sees the pentagram appear in her hand. According to the legend, the werewolf will know the identity of his next victim when he see the pentagram appear in the victim's hand. Bela excuses himself and a fearful Jenny leaves. Moments later poor Jenny is attacked by a creature in the woods and killed. Lawrence Talbot rushes to her rescue, but he shows up too late to be of any consequence. Suddenly, he finds himself battling the mythical predator and he manages to kill it by striking repeated blows with his walking stick. During the skirmish, the werewolf bites Lawrence and he heads back to Talbot Castle. Colonel Paul Montford (Ralph Bellamy of "His Girl Friday"), Sir John, Dr. Lloyd (William Warren of "Upperworld"), and Talbot's game keeper Frank Andrews (Patric Knowles of "The Devil's Brigade") investigate the murder scene and are puzzled by the Bela's naked feet. Incidentally, Frank Andrews is Gwen's future husband. Of course, Bela could not have been entirely naked because that would have changed everything as well as violated the PCA's dictates. Afterward, Lawrence struggles without luck to convince everybody that he is a werewolf, but nobody believes him. When he tries to display the wound that he received during the clash with Bela, Lawrence is surprised to find it gone. At one point, Lawrence meets Gwen and Frank at a shooting gallery and Lawrence cannot bear to shoot a wolf.Later, Larry visits the gypsy camp to meet with Bela's mother Maleva (Maria Ouspenskaya of "Love Affair") about helping him. Maleva warns him that he will be a werewolf forever and Lawrence is horrified at this prospect. No sooner has his destiny been assigned than Lawrence changes into a werewolf. The first part of his body to undergo the transformation is his foot. He attacks a grave digger, Richardson (Tom Stevenson) and kills him. The following morning, Lawrence, awakens and finds muddy wolf tracks in his room. Sir John discusses the legend of the werewolf with a curious Lawrence and the former puts the legend down to a story about good and evil in the human soul. Meantime, Montford deploys a bear-trap. Predictably, Lawrence blunders into it. Happily, Maleva finds Lawrence before the others discover him and sets him free. Gwen wants to go away with Lawrence, but the worst of all things happens. Lawrence sees the pentagram in the palm of Gwen's pretty hand. Of course, Sir John believes that his son has gone crazy with talk about a werewolf. Nevertheless, Sir John agrees to lock Lawrence up in his room to prevent him from transforming. Sir John joins Montford and the others in the foggy landscape as they await the appearance of the gruesome beast. Gwen stumbles into the woods and Lawrence attacks her. Armed with his son's silver cane, Sir John hits the werewolf with the stick and kills it. He watches in horror as the wolf changes back into Lawrence. Montford concludes Lawrence died killing the wolf that tried to kill Gwen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Step Into The Lair of the Traditional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trolls, Trolls...come out come out wherever you are! I invite you to attack!I mean, isn't that what is going to happen if I give a Classic Horror film, much loved, a mere 7 Rating. A 7 Star rating ain't shabby--but let's face it together: I've just come from giving KILLER KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE a perfect score, and I am willing to give SESSION 9 a strong 8-Star ranking. And now, I tackle a so-called classic of the Horror genre, THE WOLFMAN from 1941, and I'm tempted to dole out a 6-Star ranking, only to stop short and call "Foul!" on myself, and stop at a 7. It's all very traditional. And, of course, safe...by 2011 standards, the year outside as I write this review. I can't help that. I don't have a 2-minute attention span, I'm more patient than that, so don't say I'm guilty of that, like some kid hooked on video games. It's just that-- sigh--we have the traditional mist, and the the traditional night, and the traditional big music, and the screams of women in distress, and the traditional nice level-headed chap with the friendly father, and the traditional hunters of wolves with stern looks and big guns and their intrepidness (hey, I don't knock Ralph Bellamy channeling James Coburn before we even saw James Coburn on film, it works, and Bellamy is one of the best things in the film and not given enough credit for his steely determination mixed with a bit of humor). It all works nicely, and it's all very safe by 2011 standards, which, I'm sorry, but, I'm forced to apply.I like this film. It's got mood, and star power, a story that rolls along effortlessly, and although I'm wondering why the original werewolf that bites poor Larry Talbot actually IS in pure wolf form (down on four paws and highly, savagely, canine), and the next werewolf look we get is the classic make-up and fur job that we all know, and that do generally rate as effective. Though repeated shots of the same stalking legs are almost as annoying as the same poetic incantation muttered over and over again, I find. And so, it's definitely 1941 at Universal. Meanwhile, also safe is smiling Lon Chaney Jr. in this, much praised for his nice- guy with the hound-dog look and the gentle manner, as balanced against the admittedly frightening, feral beast he's forced to become. But I can't help wishing for that modern touch we just can't have here--a guy who is not so nice and stray-mutt likable before he becomes a monster. Chaney Jr. is so big and menacingly-built, but all the menace is saved for the limited amount of screen time his wolf self has. Y'know, the most I've been scared of Lon Chaney Jr. is in THE ALLIGATOR PEOPLE where he gets to terrorize without a lot of monster make-up on, and all that hugeness gets to run amok. Even in MAN MADE MONSTER, we have this big, intimidating guy who makes you want to hug him, and then he gets transformed; can't we just hate him? And if he's that nice, is he really gonna do anything that horrible? Darn. If only the Chaney Jr. wolf man got to do more menacing stuff, and if only Frank Talbot weren't so...gee-golly.But he is. In 1941, you change a sweetheart into a wolf dude. You don't pick a Tobin Bell or Robert Englund, who look like the're just waiting to turn into some kind of demon.So, it's a classic. And by golly, you should watch it. In fact, go crazy--immerse yourself in Classic Universal Horror. But if, like me, you come away oddly unfulfilled while people hate you for it, it's because you've seen ALIEN, HALLOWEEN, John Carpenter's THE THING. You dove in with the shark. I don't think THE WOLF MAN is dated, in the sense that "Oh, this doesn't wear well because it's old.". It's safe, rather. It's traditional. Lacking in subtlety--or what was considered subtle is actually now quite unsubtle. Subtle is not "oh how ironic when everyone is dismissing the werewolf legend for the first 20 minutes of the film, because I know what's going to happen". Subtle is Ash saying to Ripley: "The time it takes to get there, you'll--they'll know if it's a warning or not.". You gotta be quick to hear that "you'll" from Ash, and figure out what he almost said, and what it hints about him. But this is not ALIEN; this is THE WOLF MAN (1941).A word about Claude Rains. Hey, I loved him in NOTORIOUS, one of my all-time favorite films! Here in The WOLF MAN, now that I've done repeated viewings, some of that amazing reservedness and charm in the face of crisis from the Hitchcock film comes off as a bit wooden and dull here--and it has more to do with passing him off as Chaney Jr.s father. It doesn't throw me as much these days; Rains gives it his all in THE WOLF MAN, and there is something really cool about seeing two so different actors as Lon Chaney Jr. and Claude Rains playing son and father. But I never really get past the weirdness of these two as playing relations...and I think Rains and Chaney Jr., though not working at cross-purposes, never really gel as father and admittedly prodigal, Americanized son.Recommended to me by: Fangoria Magazine issue # 300, which features a List of "300 Best" Horror films--THE WOLF MAN write-up done by List contributor Brian Solomon (B.S.)Also featured as a selection in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die (Updated Edition, 2011), with the film's entry provided by SJS/Steven Jay Schneider (General Editor of the book).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best of the Universal Monsters pictures, but fantastic just the same</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While The Wolf Man's inclusion into the pantheon of Universal Monsters which the studio became predominantly identified with in its early years is wholly justified, the film that launches the arc of this indelible character is actually one of the more uneven inaugural offerings in Universal's six classic franchises. Still, for anyone who appreciates the genesis of the studio's iconic definition of contemporary horror, The Wolf Man is mandatory viewing, and despite its faults the end result is a highly enjoyable and thoroughly solid entry.The brilliant acting of the ensemble cast can be held directly responsible for much of the film's effectiveness. Lon Chaney, Jr. leads the way with a very strong turn as the blighted Larry Talbot, and perfectly essays the Jekyll and Hyde theme at the core of the story. Chaney is a likable and charming protagonist, and when the horrors of his curse begin to manifest, he channels the character's sequence of emotions into a nuanced and tragic screen presence.Claude Rains grounds the film with his sensible yet intense performance as Larry's father, and the scenes between he and Chaney are gripping exchanges that any student of acting would be wise to take a look at. Bela Lugosi's appearance as the (rather un-creatively-named) gypsy Bela is a genuine treat, and the venerable horror icon makes a strong impression despite his relatively scant screen time, further showcasing what a brilliant character actor he was. Evelyn Ankers furthers the tradition of attractive leading ladies which was practically a trademark of the Universal Monster canon, and her nimble performance is excellently understated.Parts of the werewolf mythos outlined here are intriguing bits of lore which have been largely abandoned in other contemporary lycanthropy fables. The association of pentagrams with the monster here may not make much sense to modern audiences, especially since Talbot is ultimately a sympathetic figure, not an evil villain; yet the notion that someone afflicted with lycanthropy sees the ancient symbol manifested in the palm of their next victim's hand is a nice touch, and this device is played to great dramatic effect here.Jack Pierce's werewolf make-up and the transformation sequences are surely primitive by today's standards, but the former has endured remarkably well, and the close-ups of Chaney in full monster mode are still thrilling. However, the dissolves used to portray Chaney's shift from man to beast don't look very sophisticated or spectacular, even for the time. These scenes certainly have a quaint simplicity about them, but when you consider the still-impressive camera tricks employed in The Invisible Man a decade before, one has to wonder why a more clever method wasn't devised to capture these crucial scenes.While most of the sets have the customary lushness that made Universal's monster movies look much more expensive than they were, the often-used simulations of the woodlands the Wolf Man stalks are largely pretty underwhelming. There are very few moments where it isn't clear we're seeing action unfolding on a sound-stage, so recalling how often Universal productions adeptly presented a complete immersion into the setting (picture the amazingly-rendered interior of Dracula's castle), this one aspect of the production falls a bit short.There's also a confusing gaffe that is never addressed in the film. When Larry first transforms into the Wolf Man he's wearing a white tank top and slacks, yet when he prowls as the titular beast we see him adorned with a long sleeve button-up shirt and matching trousers. I'm very capable of suspending my disbelief, but I've always wondered why a recently transformed feral monster would be inclined to change its clothes before going on the prowl.Though The Wolf Man has a few weaknesses, the plot unfolds at an excellent pace, and the heightening of the werewolf's monstrous deeds is as grisly and horrific as the era would allow. The terse conclusion ends the movie on a strong note, and though Chaney would reprise his role in Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, this original outing holds up as a fine stand-alone story, while still leaving ample room to delve deeper into the mythology in subsequent films.Yes, The Wolf Man has its flaws, but it is nevertheless a classy and well-crafted gem that should not be missed by anyone who appreciates the golden age of horror. Even several decades later, this one still has its teeth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little unsteady at times with the romance and such, but mostly a good, tension-filled Universal horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first learned about this 1940's Universal horror film, starring Lon Chaney Jr., probably about two or three years ago. Before renting it the other day, I thought it was released in 1935, but it turns out that's another werewolf movie, entitled "Werewolf of London", which I've yet to see. By the time I finally watched "The Wolf Man" just last night, I knew this film was actually released in 1941. I haven't seen most of the old Universal horror movies, but had seen several of them from different decades by the time I saw this one, and most of them had been good. Before watching it, I knew this 1941 release was not the most highly regarded film from the Universal horror years, but still highly praised, so my expectations were reasonably high, and they were basically met.After the death of his brother, Larry Talbot returns to his ancestral home, a castle in Wales, where his father, Sir John Talbot lives. Shortly after arriving, he sees a young woman named Gwen Conliffe, who runs an antique shop in town. He buys a silver headed cane with a wolf-shaped head from her store, and is told that it represents the werewolf, a human being who sometimes transforms into a wolf. That night, Larry goes out with Gwen, who brings along her friend, Jenny. They come to a gypsy camp to have their fortunes told. Shortly after meeting a gypsy named Bela, Jenny is found by Larry in the forest, being attacked by what appears a wolf! Larry fights and kills this wolf with his cane, but is badly bitten during the fight and Jenny has not survived the attack! When police investigate, they find Jenny's body, but don't find a wolf's body nearby. Instead, they find the body of Bela, and it appears that he was the wolf! Now that Larry has been bitten by a werewolf, he might be one himself! After the film starts, it isn't very long before Larry sees Gwen through a telescope and immediately goes over to her store, telling her he's "psychic." He falls in love with her just from finding her with the telescope. Scenes like this show that the romantic aspect of the film definitely could have been done better and probably certain other aspects could have as well, though I still was intrigued during this early store scene for some reason. However, with horror movies like this, viewers obviously expect tension, and there's a lot of that in "The Wolf Man" to help make most of it entertaining. The film also has some very good visuals for its time, especially in the mist-enshrouded forest scenes. The only film I had seen Lon Chaney Jr. in before this one was the first "Of Mice and Men" adaptation, but his performances in both of these films didn't let me down, and I'm convinced he was a talented actor. Most of the acting in this 1941 Universal horror movie is good, even if not everyone in the cast can match Chaney. It's been nearly seventy years since the release of "The Wolf Man", but if you're into old black and white movies and want a memorable adrenaline rush, this could certainly be a good choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lon Chaney Stars in the Best of the Universal Monster Movie Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compared to the Universal horror films of the 1930s (of which it is a direct descendant), "The Wolf Man" is practically a masterpiece. Solid production values and a top-notch cast of character actors led by Claude Rains, Maria Ouspenskaya, Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney in the title role lend this film a sheen of quality and respectability seriously lacking in the earlier films. And "The Wolf Man" feels the most unique of the monster movie formulas -- you sympathize with the monster, because he's overcome by urges he can't control (paging Dr. Freud) and hates what he becomes when he hears the call of the wild.

		<shortDescription>A brew bereft of the old magic, but so very amusing and enjoyable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film certainly has a sprinkling of magic about it; it is hard to quantify where exactly such a quality resides, but it is there, by jove! Perhaps it is the pared-down nature of the story; not altogether very far from the narratives of the classic Universal Horrors of the thirties. Although the precision and artistry of a Mamoulian or Whale is entirely missing, the production is astutely mounted, and just enough typical Universal atmosphere makes itself felt.Lon Chaney Jr. is ever amusing as the rather shifty Talbot Jr., an appallingly sexist (yes, I know, one must consider the times!) and dubious man, who very quickly falls prey to old legends, canes and wolf attacks. The clash between his very American brash-come-hapless persona and Claude Rains's absurdly stern English patriarch provides much of the amusement. How on earth are these two supposed to be related? Even father and son indeed!?There is little point in mentioning the forgettable, risible stereotyping of the female 'love interest', who is, in time-honoured horror fashion, placed in jeopardy vis-a-vis the Wolf Man. One really has to look at this film as an enjoyable, if minor and routine, genre film. There is, however, so much to amuse one's self with - particularly the absurd varieties of incredulous dialogue - that I am driven to indulge it with a solid grading. This is a lesser Universal Horror, but an irritatingly palatable one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney) returns to the house of his father Sir John (Claude Rains) after his brother dies in an accident. He falls in love with a beautiful girl in the nearby village (Evelyn Ankers). While there he is attacked by a wolf. He kills it but it bites him and turns into a man (Bela Lugosi) after it dies. He slowly realizes he's a werewolf as an old gypsy woman tries to help him.A true classic. This is where the legend started about the wolf man with wolfs bane, silver bullets, the pentagram and that great old saying "Even a man who is pure at heart and says his prayers at night, may become a wolf when the wolfs bane blooms and the autumn moon is bright". The script by Curt Siodmak is just great as is the direction and the now familiar (but still exciting) score that Universal used in all its monster movies. The acting is just perfect--people react and talk like real people! Rains is just incredible as Sir John. He doesn't believe in the werewolf "nonsense" (as he calls it) but realizes it may be true. This film made Chaney and introduced him in his role as the tortured Larry Talbot. He's pretty good. Ankers is wonderful in the thankless love interest part and the wonderful Maria Ousprnskaya steals every scene she's in. There's also great atmosphere in the misty forest and Chaney looks a little spooky in his makeup. This is a wonderful film and is well worth catching. Ignore the dreadful 2010 redo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Wolf Man" is a film that any horror fan should see for its sheer historical value alone, but it has lost some of its edge due to the passage of time. The main problem is that the audience is one step ahead of the script throughout the film: we know what will happen, and when, and why, and we are waiting for the characters to figure it out for themselves. The poor casting doesn't help; I wonder who the genius who thought that Claude Rains and Lon Chaney Jr. made a convincing father-and-son pair was. The basic points of interest for genre buffs are Jack Pierce's outstanding makeup effects, and the beautiful black-and-white photography. (**1/2)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a patch on earlier Universal classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A hotchpotch of actors, not to mention accents, and a generally limp direction, fail to overcome an obviously low budget, poor script and a lack of atmosphere or suspense. Claude Rains, although clearly bored, gives his usual professional performance, but Lon Chaney Jr struggles in the title role, despite managing to win the sympathy of the audience. Ralph Bellamy is ludicrous as a local flatfoot and Bela Lugosi is wasted. The coupling of Rains and Chaney as father and son is laugh-out-loud ridiculous and the Wolf Man himself resembles a rather cute teddy bear who cowers behinds trees and walks on his tiptoes. (And for all fans of Carry On films, the image of Jim Dale playing the same part immediately springs to mind - only he was scarier). Evelyn Ankers as the love interest, is the only actor to emerge with real credit. A real duff compared to James Whale's superb Frankenstein duo of the '30s, or even the original Universal Dracula, although at 70 minutes most viewers (and all horror fans) will see it through to the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What was the first werewolf movie? Some are claiming Werewolf of London in 1935, but what about The Wolf Man in 1924? Regardless, of who was first, this version is considered to be the classic and the one that gets most people upset when they hear it is being remade with Benicio Del Toro.Personally, I like Jack Nicholson's performance in Wolf, and Darkwolf is a favorite also. But, we are talking classics here, and Lon Chaney Jr's performance was outstanding.He had a great supporting cast in Claude Rains as his father, Bela Lugosi as Bela, the werewolf who bit him, and the beautiful Evelyn Ankers, who made many a movie for Universal.Creepy and dark and overacted, this was just what made Lon Chaney Jr. a household name.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modest little thriller has lost some of its "terror" appeal...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Leonard Maltin goes a bit overboard in approving of this classic Universal thriller from the early '40s, I found it a bit slow-moving despite the fact that it runs little more than an hour. The horror elements are well done when they finally are unleashed but the early scenes in town where Lon Chaney, Jr. first meets Evelyn Ankers (through a telescope!!) are a bit hokey and unconvincing. It takes time to build up any suspense but does create the appropriately eerie atmosphere within a short space of time.Chaney's interpretation of Larry Talbot is a good one, showing the anxiety that comes with his transformation, but the script doesn't give him enough of a chance to create a really interesting character. Later on, in subsequent films where he played The Wolf Man, he had better material to work with.All of the performances are standard for this kind of thing--with Patric Knowles and Ralph Bellamy having the most thankless supporting roles and Claude Rains giving the most effective performance as Sir John Talbot. However, any possibility that he could be the father of the hulking Chaney is incredible when you see them side by side!The score by Charles Previn is appropriately chilling. Fun to watch during the Halloween season.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney) comes back to his father's estate after 18 years because of the death of his brother. His timing couldn't be worse, as there is just a group of gypsies coming to town, and one of them, 'Bela' (yes yes, our very own hero of cinema, Bela Lugosi, hail hail) becomes a werewolf at night. When he attacks and kills a young woman one night, Larry Talbot kills him but gets bitten first. Which makes him the next werewolf.The plot thickens as at that time Larry has found himself an engaged girl, Gwen (Evelyn Ankers), and she's into him as well. It's a good thing she's got an understanding fiance...Most impressive scene is when Sir John Talbot (Claude Rains) has to kill the beast, of which he knows it's his own son, to save the rest of the town. Great drama there.But overall there isn't that much to enjoy, except for the very funny Mister Twiddle, some spooky swamp/forrest scenes and a pretty decent monster for its era.6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective, but not a true classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strangely-American Lawrence Talbot, Lon Chaney, Jr., returns to home to his native England, and finds himself turning into a beast during the full moon after he was attacked by a wolf. "The Wolf Man" is instinctively included in the pantheon of classic Universal horror films, but this film is simply not in the same class as "The Bride of Frankenstein," "Dracula" or even "The Creature From The Black Lagoon." The production and art direction tries but fails to capture the style of the classic films from the 1930s. Everything is a little too slick and streamlined. More importantly, I simply didn't buy Lon Chaney, Jr., in the title role. It isn't that I didn't find himself sufficiently angst-ridden. He was. He efficiently conveyed the torment of the doomed. I simply couldn't buy Chaney as Claude Rains' son, a scion of British nobility. He was too American, and too contemporary to fit into the mode. (Expository information, notwithstanding.) That said, I had a much easier time accepting him in the sequels, particularly "Frankenstein meets the Wolfman," which removed his character from the original social context. I don't mean to be too hard on the film. It is an effective film - just not a true classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not The Greatest Horror Film Of That Period But Deserves One Look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all the horror films released during the 30's and 40's, The Wolf Man was not the best of them to be honest. Lon Chaney Jr. and the rest of the cast did a good job with their roles; however, I have seen much better werewolf films.The plot is simple-Lon Chaney Jr. plays Larry Talbot who gets bitten by a werewolf so inevitably, he becomes a werewolf himself in the course of time. That's the plot anyway.The acting was good (as was all the acting during that period before SOME actors and actresses became prima donna bigheads who demanded exorbitant wages for their work)which helped make this film an average one as opposed to a poor one. In fact, the acting was very good. I really can't put my finger on what I disliked about this film. Perhaps it was far too tame (even by 1940's film standards), perhaps there were too few appearances of The Wolf Man himself, I simply do not know. All I know is that after viewing the movie, I felt dissatisfied and I certainly preferred other horror films of that period.However, it's a five star classic compared to some of the junk that passes for horror nowadays. Watch it to see the talented actors and actresses-that's a good enough reason to see it. It's a tame film but I think it can be enjoyed if you really want to. By the way, the sequel to this film is Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man-now that really is a film to get your teeth into (no pun intended).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For some reason, the Wolf Man remains one of my favorite monster movies of all time. Jack Pierce is the wizard of Hollywood make up and the transformations are so well done that they are even comparable to modern (pre-CGI) FX. Claude Raines delivers a superb perfomance as Sir John and Maria Ouspen.a..ie..ouka...oh... MALEVA adds just the right amount of creepiness to give the film its exotic feel. Beleive it or not there is actually a moral and cautionary tale to this story. The moral is about neglect. Neglect to one's values and the consequences thereof. Larry neglected his family and ran away to America. Thus he was cursed as a Werewolf. Sir John neglected Larry's personal growth and needs and thus found himself in the awful position of murdering his own son. (Remember this is not long after Sir John loses his first son.) But ultimately, I think the most important and effective moral this story can give is this: If a gypsy offers you a warning of any kind....HEED IT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie has its historical value, no doubt about it. It was really the last entry in Universal Studio's money-making monster list -- "Dracula," "Frankenstein," "The Mummy," and then "The Wolf Man," by which time the franchise was losing its commercial wallop. It was to be revived briefly in the post-war period with Abbott and Costello.When I was a kid, in the era before CGIs and axes, this would have made my hair stand on end because it has all the ingredients of a good horror movie. I would have accepted without question the authenticity of the locations and characters. And the plot would have been scary.The spookiest forests are always those that are built on a studio sound stage and are carpeted with CO2 fog. And these woods always seem to be in the right place when an innocent person, a potential victim, needs to move from one point to another.Now -- older, if no wiser -- I notice that the sets evoke Mitteleuropa, while the location is supposed to be England. The material and technology are 19th century at best. There are no electric lights. Citizens chase monsters through those foggy forests while holding flaming torches. Vehicles include gypsy wagons and they are all drawn by horses. At the same time, I have to note that the performers all sport the clothing, the accessories, and the speech styles of 1941.The anachronisms don't really bother me THAT much. It's the idea that whoever put this production together in such a slapdash manner thought that it wouldn't occur to me or to anyone else in the audience that there was something a little mixed up about what we're watching on the screen. We're supposed to swallow Evelyn Ankers' spiffy modern wardrobe along with those creaking, horse-drawn gypsy carts. Well, I for one won't do it, not as an adult. I have a tough enough time with just Metamucil and a glass of water.The plot is kind of interesting, especially in the first half hour, when Lawrence Talbot (Chaney, Jr.) is just a nice young hefty guy returned to his country estate from the states. He never heard of werewolves. He's okay at being innocent in a dumb way. The last part of the movie, as he realizes what's happening to him, calls for pathos and he can't deliver. When he's actually in his werewolf persona, those sorts of considerations become irrelevant because no acting is called for. The supporting cast is professionally competent. Claude Raines stands out, however. He's a pretty good actor, whether he's playing a madman ("The Invisible Man") or a sympathetic villain ("Notorious").Universal's writers did their best to come up with some tag lines. There's "an old proverb" repeated two or three times about "ven da voolfbane blooms and da autumn moon is bright." They don't measure up to "Dracula's." They don't even match "Frankenstein" -- "Ohh, get BECK, get BECK -- it's ALIVE." However, for completists and curiosity seekers, this is required viewing. Also for ten-year-olds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If ever there was a "nice guy" monster, this is it. Lon Chaney, Jr. plays Larry Talbot--the son of a rich land owner (played by the great Claude Rains). Well, one day Larry is going for a walk and is just minding his own business when he's attacked by what he at first thinks is a wolf. Well, it turns out to be a werewolf and he is bitten in the process, so he is doomed to spend all the nights with full moons seeking out humans to rip to shreds. Bummer--especially since Larry is a really nice guy and you do feel very sorry for him--this is the best aspect of the story. Well, our hero is indeed a sweet guy, though pretty dumb, as it never occurs to him that he COULD be locked in a padded cell and kept there whenever there's a full moon. Instead, he again and again roams the countryside ripping apart innocent folks until eventually he is killed by Talbot's nice father--who only then realizes the immensity of his deed. I think he should have stopped feeling so bad about killing the young man, as Larry is back in a couple more films as apparently it's tough to kill a werewolf EVEN IF YOU ARE USING SILVER! So, Claude, relax,...you didn't really kill him. At least not permanently!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little out-dated, but not bad for its time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't really claim to know much about Lon Chaney Jnr., or other old school horror films. I was mainly bought up on 70s and 80s horror movies, and this is the first of the Universal monster films that I've seen. The only other 40s horror film that I've seen is 'Cat People', which was also a little dated. However, the subject of this classic is the notorious creature known as the werewolf.I found the main problem with this film is it's story and script. Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jnr.) returns to his hometown to see his father, Sir John Talbot (Claude Rains). Upon his return, he falls for an antique store clerk named Gwen (Evelyn Ankers), who is subsequently engaged. It is during his attempts to woo Gwen, that the dialogue consists of "werewolf mythology' through his purchase of a cane with a wolf's head on it. Then, after this discussion of werewolves etc, Larry manages to force his way to having a date with Gwen to see the fortune teller gypsy, who just happened to arrive in his town. Of course, the fortune tellers consist of an old gypsy woman (Maria Ouspenskaya), and her partner, Bela (Bela Legusi), and you don't have to be an expert to guess that the date ends up with Larry being bitten by a werewolf. The whole set-up felt a little contrived in my opinion, and it would have could have been better scripted. It's almost like "wow, that's funny, we were just talking about werewolves, and I just got bitten by one! Who would have thunk it?" dinner conversation.The rest of the film consists of John Talbot defending his son's actions that fateful night, and poor Larry realising that he might be becoming a werewolf. Of course, the doctor and his father think he is subsequently losing his mind, and the authorities believe a wolf is on the loose.For its time, 'The Wolf Man' is probably what is to be expected from the early incarnations of the genre. However, like 'Cat People', it's extremely dated, and the characters aren't as intriguing as they could have been. Both Rains and Chaney do an okay job, but neither are convincing as father and son. Chaney shines best when character is conflicted, and there is some interesting philosophical dialogue between him and his father, as well as some ludicrous scenes that set Larry off. The make-up is really dated, but I guess it wasn't bad for it's time. However, it's extremely dated and unconvincing now and resembles nothing of the fearsome creature that modern audiences imagine. And when you can spot hairless skin underneath the clothes, it kind of feels a little fake. The atmosphere and mood enhance this film with foggy forest and its use of music, but it's neither scary nor convincing as a horror film. The script and story should have been done differently, even for a 40s movie, instead of having the coincidental nature of spoken dialogue forecasting the overall plot. It is however well-acted, and thankfully very short. At 67 minutes, you can hardly complain about being bored! Yes, this a classic for it's genre, but it's not a great film. A good one for it's time perhaps, and worth watching once if you are genuinely interested in the Universal Studio monster-themed films of the 40s.*** out of *****!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I tried to love it and I tried to hate it! (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting this movie to be either really great or really lame, but it was neither. It was a time-passer that had nothing particularly awful to moan about and nothing particularly special to rave about.The cast was likeable, with Claude Rains and Lon Chaney the best of the bunch, although they didn't ever convince as father and son. As my first Bela Lugosi movie it was a disappointment to find his was only a small role and that he made no real impact. Evelyn Ankers was fairly attractive, but Maria Ouspenskaya was cursed with a role that had only three lines repeated over and over again. The rest of the cast were like the movie itself; nothing special.The set-up in the opening scenes was clumsier than Jar Jar Binks, with three people reciting the poem about werewolves, a close-up of a dictionary definition of lycanthropy, a cane with a wolf's head on it, and stories of how the wolf can see its next victim. Either everybody in this town is obsessed with werewolves, or the writers couldn't figure out a more sophisticated way of letting the audience in on the legend.It seems unfair to be bored by The Wolf Man because although I've seen its story in other movies and TV shows, this was made years before all of them. But the feeling of déj? vu is unavoidable, and this ended up as the kind of movie you don't really watch, you just look at.It was never particularly involving, but it was never particularly boring either, so it falls into the most frustrating of categories. It's impossible to feel passion for it in either direction, and I'd rather hate a movie than feel nothing for it at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One dimensional horror classic now seems pretty tame.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the Universal monsters, it was THE WOLF MAN that most terrified me as a boy and at the same time was the only one who elicted my sympathy. DRACULA, FRANKENSTEIN and THE MUMMY were either evil or automatons. Larry Talbot was the only creature who didn't want to be what he was or was capable of being. This is a slight metaphor for those "who are different" or marginal members of society who are taught to hate who they really are inside. When one considers that in the whole film Talbot as the Wolf Man only kills one person and has only three nights of transformation before he is "killed" by his father, he is literally getting the short end of the stick. What an amazing roster of "name" actors they assembled for this venture: Rains, Chaney, William, Bellamy, Ouspenskaya, Lugosi. It's fun to watch them being deadly serious about the goings-on. Also the script is pretty literate for its day, discussing the philosophy of lycanthropy as opposed to its reality. Did anyone ever notice that the bulky and big-framed Chaney got much slimmer and more agile once the "Wolf Man"'s metamorphosed - could it be that an unnamed actor actually played the beast? Fun continuity error - when Talbot undergoes the first transformation he is in a white shirt - when he emerges as the Wolf Man, it has become a dark shirt. Guess that moon had an awesome effect on clothing. Another error - once Maleva has told Larry what's going to happen to him she spreads the news through the gypsy camp to pack up as a werewolf is on the loose. Well, her own son was a werewolf in camp the night before and you didn't see her warning anyone. Selective terror here! Only three actual transformations -the first of Talbot's legs only (heightening the tension of what he's going to look like) and two each of tranformation back into Talbot from the Wolf Man - none transforming from Talbot to Wolf Man. We were rooting for Evelyn Ankers to get chewed up - any one callous enough to not react to her friend's death and stupid enough to run into a fog-filled forest knowing a werewolf is lurking about deserves to become a meal. Pretty tame this time around (and it's well into its second half before we even glimpse the Wolf Man), but I guess our idea of what is horrifying has matured. Now we think we'd rather have a werewolf or two lurking about than live in such a violent and unpredictable world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poor Larry Talbot. He didn't ask to be bitten or cursed with the beastly malignancy so uncontrollable it doesn't reoccur to him once the werewolf does it's business destroying the throats of innocents in a village. No other character's tragedy was exploited as much as Talbot's by the Universal Monster series.Trying to save Jenny, a young woman being attacked by a werewolf, Larry Talbot is bitten. He kills the wolf with a silver wolfs-head cane he just recently purchased, but later finds to his amazement that it was a gypsy named Bela(Lugosi). His mother, Maleva(portrayed by the great Maria Ouspenskaya), warns Talbot of his new affliction revealing to him that it wasn't simply a wolf he killed and was bitten by.The chief constable(Ralph Bellamy)needs answers to a rash of wolf slayings and as Talbot becomes more and more aware of his illness, his life becomes truly unbearable. He doesn't wish to kill and just knowing that this wolf beast lies waiting for the Full Moon becomes an unbearable burden. Sir John(Claude Rains)wishes to shield his son from this whole crazy idea of lycanthropy. He deeply loves his son and sees that something is starting to effect him. When John sees no other way to convince Larry that his mind is being polluted by the superstitions of a gypsy woman, John will tie him to a chair. John will humor his son when Larry begs for him to take the silver wolfs-head cane for protection not knowing this may very well be what saves his own hide.Gwen(Evelyn Ankers)is Larry's paramour and knowing she could be in danger if he turns after seeing the sign of the pentagram on her hand(Meleva tells of how this necklace with the pentagram symbol will assist in his fight against the beast inside him), brings even more misery and a desire to get out of Dodge before he can harm those he loves and cares for.It's always been a double-edged sword for Lon Chaney Jr. His dad was the incredible Man with a Thousand faces and it's a legend just to difficult to follow. yet, he provided us with the tragic hero of Larry Talbot. His later years are truly sad, but he gave us such an endearing character through numerous Universal sequels that we could appreciate. This is the sterling example most werewolf films live by and Talbot is the definitive tragic hero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the shadow of Lugosi and Karloff . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the big three Universal horror franchises, I think Bride of Frankenstein is my favorite film while Lugosi's Dracula is my favorite of the monsters. Chaney and his lycanthropic creation fall into third place as far as both films and creatures go. I liked Chaney the first time I saw him as Larry Talbot (which, unfortunately, was not this film). I liked his sympathetic eyes and seemingly unending expression of sadness (especially after the werewolf curse kicks in); it made for a very likable character until, that is, we hear him whine across four films without evolving one bit. Let the man die and rest in peace. Seeing the films out of order did hurt my viewing of this film. I feel if this were my first glimpse of Talbot, I'd of liked him better, and altogether liked the movie better. Anyway, I did enjoy seeing another side of Larry before the lycanthropy curse got a hold of him, before the unending monologues of not wanting to go through the transformation again, before he went on and on about being a killer with no one ever believing him, you get the idea.I probably would have appreciated the transformations much more had I not already been exposed to the number of repeat scenes (which improved and perfected the technique) in the sequels. I will say the multiple dissolves in rapid succession was inspiring the first time I saw it in action in House of Dracula. Again, I imagine my reaction to this film would have been more positive had I seen it first. The sequels and spin-offs, unfortunately, literally milked the original for all it was worth, and when everything is said and done, there's not much left to go back to.Still, I found enough reasons to keep watching. The tangent with the silver-tipped cane proved interesting, the poem (though overdone) was a nice touch, the pentagram-in-the-next-victim's-palm I found probably the most memorable and effective, Lugosi gave a wonderful cameo, the supporting cast was pretty strong, and the score was surprisingly good.I wish I had caught The Wolf Man before House of Dracula and House of Frankenstein. I'm curious as to whether my opinion of the film would differ based on the order I watched the above stated films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How excited I was to unwrap the DVD and experience another Universal classic as I had done when I was 10 years old watching a Saturday night horror double bill on TV. And what an unbelievable disappointment. How could the studio heads so woefully miscast Lon Chaney Jr as Larry Talbot. There's more lead in in his acting than in Frankenstein's monster's boots! I know that suspending belief is part and parcel of watching a movie of this kind but it's easier to swallow a man changing into a wolf than to accept that the magnificent elegant Claude Rains is father to the big oafish Larry. And no level of characterisation or storyline can justify that fact. Ralph Bellamy is also wasted. In my opinion, the film rides on 2 performances. Maria Ouspenskaya as Maleva and Bela Lugosi as Bela ... Lugosi. In the briefest of cameos, Lugosi steals the film from everyone with the exception of Maria. As I write this comment, I am reminded of the scene where Maleva the gypsy woman confronts Sir John Talbot. This electrifying scene makes me realise how much greater a piece of cinema this might have been had the casting and dialogue throughout the film been more consistent. A much flawed classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So this was a social commentary?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man gets bitten by wolf, man kills the wolf, man turns into wolf whenever there's a full moon. We've seen that plot God knows how many times, but "The Wolf Man" remains the quintessential lycanthrope story. Lon Chaney Jr will probably always be associated with Larry Talbot growing fur and fangs. But now, we have to look at what the movie was really saying. Curt Siodmak loosely based the idea on Nazi Germany, that a seemingly ordinary man gets taken over by an evil force and can't control himself. Well, I guess that makes the movie more than your average horror flick. Personally, I would like to assert that "An American Werewolf in London" had the neatest scene of a man turning into a wolf, while "Wolf" was the best werewolf movie ever made: it portrayed him becoming more and more lupine as they got closer to the full moon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you grew up watching black-and-white horror movies on TV as I did, you can't help but have a soft spot for "The Wolf Man". Looking at it again on DVD, I see the phony back-projection, an odd first shot of the castle (which looks like a model, and probably was). But several aspects of the film do not date, and number one is Lon Chaney (Jr.)'s incredibly sympathetic performance in the lead; tall but wilted, Chaney has a sad-dog look that is rather endearing, and even when he's smiling he appears wounded. His chemistry with Evelyn Ankers, a dandy ingénue, is wonderful, but he doesn't match up right with Claude Rains as his father (Rains is too slender, not to mention diminutive). Maria Ouspenskaya (say that three times fast!) is campy as a gypsy woman who knows all the secrets; though she seems a bit stiff and self-conscious, her line readings are appropriately grave and full of concern. Still, there are too many shots of the fog billowing around dead trees, seemingly unfinished scenes (such as Larry Talbot escaping from his bondage in a chair), but the scoring is great, most of the photography adequate, and the finale perfectly staged. Followed by the execrable "Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man". **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic werewolf movie that could use a little more bite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wolf Man completes the trilogy of classic Universal horror films; the other two being, of course, Frankenstein and Dracula. It is safe to say that this is the weakest of the three, and it's also safe to say that I was somewhat disappointed by it; but it's still a classic movie. Lon Chainey Jnr stars as Larry Talbot, a man who is attacked by a werewolf. Lon Chainey Jnr is, of course, the son of Lon Chainey Snr (Phantom of the Opera), and I think it's safe to say that Dad would be pleased with his son's performance here. Chainey portrays his character perfectly, and garners just the right amount of sympathy from the audience that the film needs. Starring alongside Chainey is Claude Rains, the star of the simply sublime The Invisible Man, and there's also a small role for a man that any self-respecting horror fan will recognise instantly; Bela Lugosi.The Wolf Man places it's emphasis on the characters and the curse of the werewolf, as opposed to placing it on the horror. Although this is certainly a good thing as it allows you to get to know the central characters and the back story of the werewolf legend (which will be of interest to all horror fans), and thus you will be able to care more upon the tragic climax; I think that the film would have been better served with more horror, as it is a horror film. The film creates a great atmosphere for itself, however, and this makes it all the more horrific, but the effects in The Wolf Man, particularly the make-up on the Wolf Man himself, are very dated, and that takes some credibility away from it. Of course, I realize that special effects weren't as good in 1941 as they are today, but the werewolf's design looks extremely shabby as the werewolf is, essentially, just a very hairy man. However, the film is able to get away with this slightly, due to the fact that portraying horror obviously isn't it's main aim.The climax of the film is genuinely heartbreaking, and it does almost make the lack of horror in the movie worthwhile. The fact that the movie does put it's emphasis on characters most certainly does pay off, don't get me wrong, but had the film have caught a balance between the two; it would have been a far superior movie. Overall, The Wolf Man is indeed a classic and one that no horror fan should go without seeing. It's not a perfect movie, but it's still recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wolf Man (1941) ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Universal's second attempt at a werewolf picture paid off with this iconic horror classic which, along with SON OF FRANKENSTEIN (1939) and ABBOTT &amp; COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN (1948), is probably the best to come out during the studio's revival of the genre after a 3-year hiatus.The film brought with it a slew of werewolf lore, courtesy of scriptwriter Curt Siodmak, which has endured to this day. Lon Chaney Jr. in his first stab at his signature role was at his peak here, since we first get to see him as a normal person to counterpoint the cursed man bent on self-destruction he would become in the sequels. He is ably supported by perhaps the finest cast ever assembled for a Universal horror film: Claude Rains and Warren William lend the whole dignity and persuasiveness, offsetting the down-to-earth single-mindedness of the likes of Ralph Bellamy and Patric Knowles; Evelyn Ankers, too, was never better than as the girl loved by Chaney - and menaced by him when in wolf form; Bela Lugosi is fine in his brief bit as the gypsy who taints Chaney with the werewolf curse, and Maria Ouspenskaya is his compassionate mother who later feels she has to take care of Chaney as well (such was the impact of her performance that she was eventually recruited for the sequel, FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN [1943]).Part of the film's success is due to the wonderful Universal 'atmosphere': fog-laden, moodily-lit sets and an excellent (and much re-used) score. Jack Pierce's make-up, very different from the one he had created for WEREWOLF OF London (1935), is the one most audiences identify with the role (despite endless imitations ever since) - though, in this case, the transformation scenes are rather discreet. The film does suffer slightly from the fact that Bela Lugosi turns into a normal four-legged wolf whereas Chaney is two-legged and remains fully-dressed (the former explained in the Commentary as probably the unfortunate remnant of an earlier script draft!) and, also, that apparently there wasn't enough werewolf footage on hand since some of it was recycled throughout the picture - not to mention the over-use of the famous werewolf ditty (cited by a variety of people), which is odd given the townsfolk's general disbelief later on at the existence of such a creature! I wouldn't necessarily put it in the same class as the first 3 Frankenstein films, Dracula (1931) or even THE MUMMY (1932) - but, despite its shortcomings, THE WOLF MAN remains one of the most sheerly enjoyable and influential horror films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wolf Man starts with Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.) returning to his Welsh ancestral home Talbot Castle after his Brother recently died in a hunting accident, Larry's Father Sir John Talbot (Claude Rains) wants him to take over the day to day running of the estate. It's not long before Larry has his beady eye on one of the local women Gwen Conliffe (Evelyn Ankers) whom he invites out. Together with Gwen's friend Jenny (Fay Helm) they all decide to visit a gypsy fortune teller named Bela (Bela Lugosi) who happens to be a Werewolf &amp; attacks Jenny later that night, Larry hears Jenny's screams &amp; rushes to help her. Larry sees a large Wolf attacking her so he beats it to death with his silver headed cane but sustains some bite marks himself. The next day &amp; the local copper Paul Montford (Ralph Bellamy) is confused as Jenny is indeed dead but no trace of any Wolf only another body, that of fortune teller Bela &amp; Larry's supposed wounds are now completely healed. It's not long before Larry discovers that the uncontrollable curse of the Werewolf has been passed on to himself...Produced &amp; directed by George Waggner I have to say I was disappointed with The Wolf Man. The script by Curt Siodmak is far too talky for me, sure there's plenty of character development but there's only so much I can take before I start to get bored. It's past the 40 minute mark before Larry turns into the Wolf man, that 40 minutes where next to nothing happens except dull exposition. The film takes itself very seriously &amp; I think it's a film of it's time &amp; it hasn't aged that well with stiff 40's dialogue, dodgy police procedures &amp; is anyone actually convinced this is set in Wales? Having said that at only 70 minutes the film isn't too long &amp; some may find some charm in it's story &amp; the period in which it was made &amp; set. Personally I just didn't find much here to enjoy, I can barely remember anything happening &amp; as a whole the film just didn't interest or grip me at all.Director Waggner does an OK job, the swamps &amp; forests are obviously sets but they add a certain atmosphere with all the low level fog. The town looks more Eastern European than Welsh &amp; no one will be impressed with the special effects these days although everything considered they ain't all that bad.With a supposed budget of about $180,000 The Wolf Man has pretty good production values even if those outdoor sets look like they're made from cardboard at times. The acting is alright.OK, I'm prepared for all the 'not useful' votes because The Wolf Man seems to be a well liked film overall &amp; people will vote my comment down but for me it just didn't entertain, scare or interest. I can't say I hated it because I didn't but at the same time I can't say I particularly liked it because I didn't so I'll say I found it watchable &amp; an average way to pass 70 minutes, overall though disappointing. The character of Larry Talbot/The Wolf Man would go on to appear in another four Universal horror films which were Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man (1943), House of Frankenstein (1944), House of Dracula (1945) &amp; Bud Abbott Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948) &amp; I think it's interesting to note The Wolf Man is mentioned only once in those titles although appear in all four films...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wolf Man (1941) **** (out of 4) Universal's last true masterpiece (although more great films would follow) has Lon Chaney, Jr. playing Larry Talbot, a man who returns to his hometown where he's bitten by a wolf and slowly turns into the title creature. THE WOLF MAN has countless logical flaws it in (Bela a four legged wolf, Larry a two) but there's no question that it packs a really big emotional punch and I think it could be argued that it's the studios most tragic character. I think technically the movie is near flawless as it contains some wonderful cinematography and the use of fog and shadows is just perfect. It also doesn't hurt that you've got Jack Pierce's terrific make-up, which ranks among the best of his career. The look of the title character certainly deserves its legendary status and it's rather remarkable to see how well it holds up all these decades later. The biggest thing going for the film are the performances with Chaney leading the way. The actor has never gotten the credit he deserved but the sympathy he makes the viewer feel for his character is without question the most important thing in the picture. It also doesn't hurt that he's got such a strong supporting cast of character actors and as a film buff it's really amazing to see how terrific the cast was here. Not only do we get Chaney but he's surrounded by the likes of Claude Rains, Warren William, Ralph Bellamy, Evelyn Ankers, Patric Knowles, Maria Ouspenskaya and Bela Lugosi. The film has an incredibly fast paced, some real nice tension and of course the ending really packs a punch. THE WOLF MAN is clearly a legendary picture that delivers just about everything you could hope for from a horror picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Barely interesting cheap-ass monster flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something I find enchanting about the old monster movies and their gloomy castle settings and spooky countrysides. The Wolf Man does have a small amount of both but it's the only thing that kept me watching.The ludicrous, utterly nonsensical story suffers the same burden as many of these quickie black and white productions in the fact that it spends a lot of time setting up character and plot only for it to go nowhere in an abrupt finale. It's like they knew that they couldn't film any decent set-pieces or exciting scenes because there just wasn't any money so they just made a 60-minute soap opera with a 10-minute wash-out ending.Set in what is apparently England, accents are all over the place from snooty British to casual Californian. The action seems to revolve around just three different sets which include an antiques shop, a castle and a forest that is so obviously a studio set with a smoke machine running off-camera to hide the flat floor.Some nice moments of atmosphere, mainly in dark shadowy sets, are the only thing that kept me watching this hopelessly dated timewaster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On Halloween 2003, I watched this movie. Hadn't seen it in 15 years or so. Diagnosis: It's a mess.It probably would have been better with a less all-star cast. Warren William has a few lines, Ralph Bellamy has a few more. Bela Lugosi has one or two but is referred to by his and his character's common name throughout.Evelyn Ankers, a horror movie veteran, is probably the best. Lon ChaneyJr., touching, too; and the plot is potentially very touching.Claude Rains is wasted. A great actor, sometimes wasted and now almost totally forgotten.On the other hand -- oh no! the pentagram! -- this is Maria Ouspenskaya at her best. I know she was a classically trained actor but in movies such as "Dodsworth," she is impossibly hammy. Here, as the gypsy fortune teller and lycanthropy expert, she is just right.This could have been very good with a better director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSOne of the least inspired Universal horrors; The Wolf Man is a slow and stoic entry into the series. That said, has there ever been a fully successful werewolf movie? It says more about the limited nature of the concept than the film itself to reveal it doesn't work. A man turning into a savage wolf is a reasonable fantasy notion (Actually it's a completely stupid idea, but I was just being charitable), but beyond that initial event what is there left to say?The Wolf Man struggles by keeping Lon Chaney human until forty minutes ? or over halfway ? into the film. And why did Bela Lugosi (an audience-grabbing cameo from a star turn who's barely in it for five minutes) turn into a real wolf yet Chaney stays partly human? The appearance is now faintly amusing, and the film lacks the wit to carry it off.The going-through-the-motions nature of the acting and the flat script really drag on one's nerves. "You talk like a detective in a novel" one character tells another. If only. The few times the dialogue does rise above the banal it's laughably trite ? "mental quagmire" indeed. Chaney gives it his best shot, though Claude Rains is clearly not interested if he's not the leading man. A rather cynical creature feature, the lycanthropic elements are indulgently signposted throughout. The wolfsbane, the cane, a wolf's image at the fairground ? even if a character had a poo on the toilet the bogroll would be made out of wolf's hair.The production is cheap, with patently obvious backdrops, and the staid left-to-right direction fails to impress. Look out too for slap-dash continuity, such as the scene where Chaney first talks to Evelyn Ankers by the tree ? clock the position of his hand. Or maybe you prefer the climax where Chaney is attacked and knocked face down to the ground... only to appear on his back on the next scene so we can see his face as he transforms.Part romance, its dated melodrama is enhanced by overblown music, while stereotyped Romanies even refer to themselves as "we Gypsies". The archetypal B-Movie, despite a retrospective reputation as a classic there's only one thing this one hour ten minute film makes you think... that it's at least an hour too long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was a child I discovered my love for werewolves. I loved films such as "The Howling", "An American Werewolf in London", and "Silver Bullet" (Silver Bullet being the first werewolf movie I ever saw, I think I was 3 or 4 at the time). "The Wolfman" was supposed to be the greatest werewolf movie of all time, so I decided to see it. I had to have been 5 or maybe 6 at the time. It did not scare me the slightest bit. It didn't even really interest me. The "greatest werewolf of all time" wasn't even a werewolf, he was exactly as the title said: a wolf man. A Freaking "werewolf" who couldn't transform completely. It's almost like a werewolf form of impotency. Instead of turning into a horrifying beast (like the werewolf in "An American Werewolf in London"), he grew a stupid looking hairdo, an underbite, some claws, and a substantial amount of excess body hair. A real (fully transformed) werewolf would look at him, laugh, and then beat him like the little b**ch that he is. It's a pity that so few movies have featured REAL werewolves and have been good. Some crappy ones being "Werewolf" and "The Howling: New Moon Rising". Just to name a couple.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wolf Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before The Howling and An American Werewolf in London came along, this was essentially the first werewolf movie to establish all the conventions that we now know. Basically, after his brother's death, Larry Talbot (character actor Lon Chaney Jr.) has returned from America to Wales to stay with father Sir John (Casablanca's Claude Rains). Larry soon meets local antique shop owner Gwen Conliffe (Evelyn Ankers), who he tries to ask out and ends up buying a cane with a silver top in the shape of a wolf. He gets to take her out, with her friend Jenny Williams (Fay Helm), and he takes them to fortune teller Maleva (Maria Ouspenskaya), and her mysterious son Bela (Dracula's Bela Lugosi), who tells Jenny to run, and she is soon attacked. Larry receives a bite from this attack from what appeared to be a wolf, but when killed turned into Bela, and the next morning, the bite disappears. The curse of "lycanthropy" has passed to Larry, and when the full moon appears he transforms into a werewolf, or The Wolf Man, ready to pounce on a victim and eat them. Larry tries to get help and convince those who could help and should know, including Gwen, but he transforms again, and in the end, before she can be attacked, his father kills him with the silver-topped cane. Also starring Ralph Bellamy as Col. Montford, Warren William as Dr. Lloyd and Patric Knowles as Frank Andrews. Chaney is great as the lead performance, the supporting cast are good too, and the scripting is intelligent to move the quite simple but effective, and sympathetic story along. The special effects might not look like much by today's standards, but being the same people that did Frankenstein is good to know, so it is a very watchable classic horror. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I scared myself watching this dog because it told me that I had a problem. Anybody who sits through this bilge has too much time on their hands and is badly in need of a life. What a snorer! Those corny graduated shots of Talbot becoming a wolf were so goofy looking - this is supposed to scare people? *Laugh* You jest! *more laughter* Every copy of this piece of junk should be destroyed immediately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tame by today's standards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may have delivered some scares in its time, but I'd hardly call it frightening by today's standards. Lon Chaney Jr. wasn't really much of an actor and the makeup/spfx are laughable at best. Worth a look for nostalgic purposes if you happen to catch it on late night television, but for genuine chills you're better off with more recent editions such as The Howling or An American Werewolf in London.</fullReview>
