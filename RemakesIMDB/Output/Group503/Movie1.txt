		<shortDescription>A Worthy Remake, Very Dark.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Wolfman" in special screenings Sunday and to be truly honest, I didn't know what to expect. I saw the original 1941 version and I really liked it and it is a classic. I was afraid that the new remake would of been very tacky and that was my biggest concern. But I have to say after I watched this movie. I was very impressed. Benicio Del Toro (An Oscar Winner) portrays the role very well and believable. The cast is very well known with people such as Emily Blunt and the great Anthony Hopkins. They don't technically give "Oscar Worthy performances", but their acting certainly is very believable. The movie oozes mysteriousness and the very Dark mood of it makes it very enjoyable. But the movie has some flaws like the story is not original and has been portrayed at least a million times. Also there are "some" tacky parts in the movie, but they aren't very important at all. So my overall consensus about the "Wolfman" is that it is a worthy remake the 1941 classic and it will gain many new fans.I highly recommend people to watch this movie, it is very entertaining and Dark.8.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't beat the classic, but comes out a better remake than most recent ones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by clarifying two things: 1) I'm a huge fan of horror Universal monster movies and the original Wolfman is a must see to me 2) I'm 18 so this review is not biased by ageThe horror genre in particular suffers an overflow of remakes, reboots, etc today. Once in a while is okay, but there's far too many at once. This is nowhere near as bad as some (looking at you especially House on a Haunted Hill and Wicker Man) but this still didn't quite hit the mark. I wanted to see originality as long as it made sense and there were some interesting ideas here. There's also some pretty good scenes as well. The problem is that it's crippled by certain problems.Let's start with the good things: Rick Baker was already loved for his effects in werewolf movies like An American Werewolf in London, and Wolf, as well as other movies where even if the movie's bad like Planet of the Apes, his work is excellent and kudos for getting him back. Baker clearly has respect for make-up legend Jack Pierce and the make-up is fantastic. I'm not a fan of CGI and I'm glad the movie cut itself down a bit although it did include it in some scenes. But Baker's work clearly shows.Hugo Weaving was great and while Anthony Hopkins had a rougher start, he still did rather well. His character is harder than Rain's portrayal but in some ways it works. Certainly more than it did for his portrayal of Van Helsing in my eyes. The settings were fantastic. There's a lot of 19th century buildings that look gorgeous and act as a perfect contrast to the dark and creepy woods. Now for the bad: The build-up in many scenes was rather limited. The asylum scene was okay, but many scenes could have built the tension better. The acting from del Toro and Blunt was rather unemotional. I found Gwen Conliffe to be more supportive in this version, but Blunt's emotions were limited. She's a beautiful woman however no doubt. del Toro looks a bit like Lon Chaney Jr. and does well in the make-up, but the Larry side is bland. He's just not able to play it as tragically as Chaney. What's more while some complained that Chaney being Claude Rains son was absurd I can sooner believe in werewolves than the idea del Toro and Hopkins are kin. Another flaw is the limited screen time of Maleva the old gypsy a key character in the original. She's okay in this, but given little to do which really ticks me off.A big factor is the werewolf itself. In movies like the original Wolfman and Mummy there was a silent dread. The monsters showed their great power by intimidation alone and the idea they can kill you and go wild but prefer to stalk and plan. Both remakes made them more open to their power. The original's felt scarier without it, but the remakes make it work in their own way a bit.I found this did better with the horror side than the emotional side. If Talbot was played as dramatically as in the original I think this might have done better. As a whole it's alright. Not too bad, but I can't say as memorable as the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No more and no less than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in a while, a movie comes along with what many people would call perfect casting. I remember when Jack Nicholson was first cast as the Joker for Tim Burton's Batman. Nicholson's portrayal was just what was expected from such a great actor in a signature role. But it was NO MORE than we expected from him. In a way, one could say it fell a little flat. Well, I feel that way about The Wolfman. First, Anthony Hopkins, one of the consistently best actors out there, gave the exact performance I would expect from him, commanding respect both as an actor and as the character he played. But it was nothing we haven't seen already. Reminiscent of Meet Joe Black or Fracture or Instinct. I'm also a fan of Benicio Del Toro, but his brooding and emotional performance was exactly what I went to the theater to see. I didn't see anything more. The same could be said for the script, a very straightforward storyline that was a bit predictable and sort of tired. On one hand, I commend the film makers for not overdoing the story with convoluted twists in an effort to be "original." But again, I wasn't surprised by anything in the storyline at all.I was anxious to see this film, and overall I was very pleased with the cinematography, the performances of the cast and of course the special effects. But I did not leave the theater saying "WOW, that was even better than I expected!" like I had hoped I would.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film for werewolf/monster lovers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In contrast to the belief and the whine of many critics, there is an audience out there for dark, gritty and atmospheric werewolf movies such as 'The Wolfman'. I will, however, not go into detail and debunk critic reviews. Instead, I'll try to be brief and express my own feelings towards this film.This movie is an instant horror classic. It has everything a werewolf fan would want: Gore, blood, atmosphere, great soundtrack, great looking werewolf and good actors. This movie is not like 'The Wolfman' from 1941. Instead, the makers went ALL-IN with this interpretation and really exemplified what's in our deepest fantasies: Intense werewolf-action. This movie doesn't try to be original in any way. What it does, however, is to take a basic story, a basic concept and develop it in an interesting way. This movie doesn't have any werewolves that are cute and look like wolves (See: Twilight). In that way, it manages to break the monotony of modern horror movies (ghost movies or torture movies). This is a RATED R, Universal monster film that should be taken for what it is: A tense adrenaline rush through the werewolf lore with great effects. This, my friends, is a movie FROM HORROR LOVERS to HORROR LOVERS.5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I really liked it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being in the late 50's in age, I grew up on Universal horror and truly love the originals. But I have to say this remake exceeded my expectations. There are many suspenseful moments and the movie makers seem to have a clear grasp of what the objective was. Also there is a clear difference between a Hollywood werewolf (looks like a big wolf on two legs) and a "Wolfman." The wolf-man looks like an indistinguishable combination of both. A monster. I like the werewolf movies but this tops the bill. Forget the professional critics. They get paid to say negative things and most often don't seem to know what they are talking or writing about. If you like this type of stuff, it is top shelf. I may see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gothic literary classic comes to life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read all the comments that complained about this movie not being wildly innovative and original. So I did some checking. And you know what? It turns out they were right. It seems there actually have been werewolf movies made before.But it seems to me that those brilliant and learned film aficionados would have gone into the multiplex expecting to see something at least vaguely familiar. Why then were so many smartypants film buffs disappointed that this movie had so much in common with previous efforts based on the same story? Maybe they were expecting some tragically comic overacting like Gary Oldman in FFC's Dracula. Maybe they wanted to see another campy throwaway rehash of a Lon Chaney Jr. b-movie. What a pity. There was so much more to see.First of all, what a treat it was to see actual actors in the movie. Little needs to be said about Sir Anthony Hopkins. His icy, reptilian portrayals of villains are legendary, and he does not disappoint here. I'm not a huge Emily Blunt fan, but her range and beauty are pleasing grace notes in everything she does. And Hugo Weaving? How many more times does he have to hit it out of the park before he finally gets the recognition he deserves? But I, for one, went to see this movie for one reason. Benicio Del Toro. And I was not disappointed, although I was mildly surprised. Del Toro has just the right blend of handsome charm and animal presence to be convincing. His portrayal, while subtly understated, is also powerfully nuanced. The surprise was how well the diverse talents in the movie melded into an ensemble. Oh, so tasty.The coup de grâce, however, is also the one thing that probably spoils this movie for most viewers. It finally takes a literary approach to what was once, and now is once again, a towering and epic literary tragedy, rather than a campy life support system for meaningless computer-generated special effects. Using Rick Baker was a stroke of genius. His masterful use of prosthetics and physical transformations gifted this movie with an elegance and immediacy so lacking in generations of poseur imitators.Freed from the usual addiction to hokey visual effects, the movie is able to develop, with subtlety and sophistication, the tragic richness of the story. True literary tragedy depends on one simple premise. The tragic character must fall from grace, by no fault of his own, due to his inherent character flaw. The tragic character must ultimately be a victim, and his fall must be inevitable.Our protagonist's path was determined long before he arrived on the moors. As he struggles heroically to overcome his own destiny, we witness the inevitability of his demise. This is the sine qua non of literary tragedy. Even American Werewolf in London got this right, deliciously and hilariously right, in fact, and this film is fraught with allusions to AWIL and other classics.The cinematography is beautiful. The score is brooding, and not nearly as derivative as it might have been. I am so glad that Danny Elfman's score was reinstated. Elfman can do no wrong. Joe Jonhson's direction is at once effortless and masterful.In short, if you are looking for a special effects cesspool like Twilight, stay home. If you want to see how a Gothic literary classic comes to life in the twenty-first century, this is your film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How do you summary a remake you've loved so much as a whole?A masterful executed movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beautiful compositions of Danny Elfman, the sets, or the atmosphere Joe Johnston has created, or of course the stunning performances of Emily Blunt and Hugo Weaving.How do i begin...I'll keep it short.I've just came back from the movies and i must say-"The Wolfman" is the best remake I've ever seen.We live in a world, filled with bad to worse remakes, only a few of them above average.But this was really good, especially when you're waiting for it such a long time.The leads were good.I was a little disappointed of sir Anthony Hopkins's acting, but in the end, there is a reason that may explain this a little.Benicio Del Toro was good as well, but i felt so close to Emily Blunt, and even to Hugo Weaving (who soon should have a knight title of his own).They were very convincing, i loved them.Joe Johnston has done his job very well-the movie was emotional at moments, and gory and scary, when needed.The kills were very impressive and there were some "jump" scenes of good quality and were very well added too.The good jump scenes are something one could see very rare in such a good quality.But here there were even a few of them.The set decoration was great-London well-adjusted to 1891, the weapons, costumes and language of the people, the atmosphere, as well.The Wolfman is a great remake with great actors and performances.Stunning!

		<shortDescription>I Want My Money Back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie seemed to start with promise. Great opening scene filled with atmosphere. But it quickly grew old. The "characters" had no depth and I neither believed or cared about them. The music was intrusive, not giving you a moment to maybe let you decide how to feel about a scene or two. It was if it was trying too hard to be a stereotypical horror movie. It just seemed to miss the point. You know the way sometimes the most frightening parts of a horror movie, are the moments where you don't get to see the horrific act or scary monster. Its left to you the audience to imagine it. Well this movie doesn't do that. And we all know we can conceive worse scenarios than are portrayed on screen. The director doesn't trust us. The cinema was emptying around me around the half way point of the movie and I wished I had joined them now. But I thought it might redeem itself in the end. Instead I was left feeling bored and wishing I had spent my money on something, anything else!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benicio and production design a winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wolfman" is a perfect choice for updating. So much of the 1941 flick rested on good production and make-up design and now we have this lush remake from director Joe Johnston and screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker. The plot comes up a little short but for the most part they've created an awesome-looking film that also comes in just right in the spooky/gory department.Benicio Del Torro takes over for Lon Chaney jr. as Lawrence Talbot, returning to his London home many years after the suicide of his mother. He is reunited with his estranged father, Sir John (Anthony Hopkins), and with his brother's grieving fiancée, Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt). There have been many killings in the village and most of the mutterings among the villagers are of a lunatic let loose in the forest. Lawrence soon comes face to face with this evil as it attacks him one night, leaving bite marks before escaping. The attack leaves the villagers very wary of Talbot and even Scotland Yard Inspector Abberline (Hugo Weaving) takes a considerable interest in him as a suspect. Of course none manage to stop him before turning into a werewolf on the prowl. As Lawrence tries to control the beast within himself, he learns of a terrible secret about his family that could put Gwen in danger.Even the original was meagerly plotted at only 70 minutes. This "Wolfman" hovers around 95, wisely excising more of the meaningless talk (about Lawrence possibly be deluded, and lycan mythology), changing some plot points around (I liked the family dynamic introduced at the mid-point), and still keeping most of the better drama in-tact. Essentially the movie is a creature-feature-actioner (there is even a final showdown between two werewolves) but when you have production values, scares, and excitement like this, that's hardly a bad thing. Johnston nails the atmosphere just right, dark, dreary and foggy and with very ominous shots of the moon. The film has a quick pace and is helped out mightily by Rick Baker's phenomenal make-up effects, Danny Elfman's haunting score, and a bloody good time where heads, arms, and so on are ripped from bodies. The creature effects, from the transformation to the carnage, is a lot of fun and exactly what people want to see from a flick like this. Benicio plays the tormented hero perfectly, wearing the emotional and psychological strain of being cursed all over his face. Blunt holds her own pretty well in an unfortunately underwritten love story and Hopkins is as sly as ever as Sir John Talbot. Flawed, but a howlingly good re-boot</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anthony Hopkins stole my $10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the first awkwardly expositional spoken dialogue in the film the director and screenwriter manage to clearly convey disinterest in character depth. This is taken to such a degree that you (the audience) are rushed through the most pathetically superficial formalities in the first 5-10 minutes, while the rest of the 'content' is delivered to you via weak, predictable foreshadowing. Foreshadowing, foreshadowing, foreshadowing. Foreshadowing and dramatic posturing fill the massive gaps where substance and story should normally take place. The problem manifests itself as a painful migraine in the head of any audience member who wouldn't be equally as entertained by simply jingling your keyring in front of them.The dialogue in the film had to have been plagiarized from the "F" graded homework of an 10th grade writing class. It's so full of rhetoric, cliché and stupid 'witty one-liners' that I openly criticize the intelligence of -everyone- who, without duress, agreed to work on this sodding mess.Who didn't see within 10 minutes that the movie would inevitably 'apex' with a werewolf vs. werewolf scene? This prescient knowledge sat in the bottom of my stomach the whole film like a poisonous omen, knowing the moment of my doom. The only real surprise in the film was its apparent Lord of the Rings tie in. Here it goes...Anthony Hopkins, the esteemed harmonica player, was bitten by Gollum, who lives in a cave in India. Inexplicably, this turns Anthony into a Wookiee. Someone should call Frodo. Anthony kills wife, son, later infects other son with Wookiee-ism. Son is arrested by Elrond, Lord of Rivendell. Son escapes via poetic justice. Son kills father, infects Elrond. True love kills son, son forgives. Next movie: Elrond terrorizes The Shire, eats hobbits. Gandalf is afflicted with Were-Balrogism. Werewolf vs. Were-Balrog ensues. Michael Bay directs.It amazes me that it costs $150 million USD to produce something that will (maybe) impress an 8 year old child for 5-10 minutes of a 102 minute session in a chair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely Has The Thrills...But It Needs A Better Story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written: October 7, 2009While I was waiting in line to see Paranormal Activity last Friday, I was invited to an early screening of a 're-imagining of a classic horror film'. Today, I took my invitation and went across town to get to the early screening. I didn't know what the hell they were going to be showing us. Many were hoping it would be A Nightmare On Elm Street or The Wolfman. I thought that either would be too good to be true. Every seat was filled up in the theater, and I was sitting next to some film critics and some film industry big-shots. After an hour of waiting in my seat, a lady came up in front of the screen and announced that we would be among the first to see The Wolfman. Everyone in the theater cheered loudly, and one guy even stood up and held a fist in the air screaming. I'm sure he made a mess in his pants due to his excitement.So this is my review of what I was shown. There may be some minor changes done to the film before its theatrical release, but I doubt its anything that would alter my review.'The Wolfman' Review The film is a remake of the 1941 horror film of the same name. The central plot follows Lawrence Talbot (Benicio del Toro), a man who re-unites with his father (Anthony Hopkins) after learning his brother has been brutally murdered. Talbot, who has had a distant relationship with his family, decides to stay home in order to discover what happened to his brother. As he gets deeper into his 'investigation', he unravels secrets from his childhood and crosses path with the werewolf, which eventually bites him and makes him a target.Let me start off with some of the positives of the film. The performances in the movie were absolutely fantastic. Benicio Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Hugo Weaving, and Emily Blunt all delivered and really brought their characters to life. It's always good to have great performances in a horror/action film. Everything seems genuine and all of the characters are very engaging. The set pieces and cinematography are all beautifully created. There's a lot of eye candy in this film just as far as the sets are concerned, and I really love the atmosphere this film created. The visuals I saw were pretty cool, although some of them were still in progress. I imagine the visuals will be awesome when the film is released next year. The music is also pretty unique and memorable. I rarely comment on the score of a film, but this one really had some great music.Some other things that impressed me were the action sequences and the 'kills'. The action sequences are pretty exciting and they'll keep you at the edge of your seat. Just when you think it's safe... something crazy happens and mayhem ensues. The 'kills' are also pretty awesome. The werewolf in this film is pretty insane, so expect to see a lot of blood, gore, and human body parts flying around all over the place. The violence, along with the dark atmosphere, really gave a suspenseful experience.While the film had lots of positive sides to it, it also had its fare share of negative attributes. The one thing that aggravated me the most was the pacing of the film. It starts off slow to introduce the characters and setting, and then all of a sudden it kicks to high gear. After it has some fast scenes (which sometimes feel as if you just skipped ahead and missed something entirely), the film will go back to a slow pacing. What I'm trying to say is that the film's pacing was pretty inconsistent. The pacing stems off and creates other problems, such as poor story elements. I feel as if some of the mysteries in the film were just solved by adding a few lines to the script. The writers probably said amongst themselves:"So, how does this happen?" "Umm...I don't know, let's just add this line or sub-plot"The story even forgets to answer some questions that may have been burning in your mind, and when you leave the theater you wonder why these questions were never answered (you can blame the writing and fast-paced scenes for that). Emily Blunt's character also seemed to be useless, and was just added to give off some romance. Finally, the ending wasn't that great. I wish it gave off more of a conclusion, but the ending just wasn't for me.Overall, The Wolfman is a fun horror/action film. The acting is great, the sets and visuals are awesome, and the action sequences are pretty cool. There are also some pretty nice kills in this one for all of you blood/gore fans. While the film can be fun, the plot suffers from the film's inconsistent pacing, which eventually leaves some plot holes. Trust me, the trailer makes this flick seem a lot cooler than it actually is. Just eat your popcorn and leave your mind at home...it's just brainless fun.Overall Rating: 6/10</fullReview>

There is enough gore, blood, and howling at the moon to go around.The storyline is predictable for the most part; though there is a understory that is reveled as the movie progresses.

		<fullReview>Not gonna go on too much just wanted to ensure people do not....I repeat DO NOT watch this dire movie and put money in pockets of those who don't deserve it.From the start it was horribly clichéd, no bad thing in itself, but it was rubbish from beginning to end. No decent character development, I didn't care for any of the people. The effects were terrible and unconvincing and the one scene where they could of excelled, in the asylum, they failed on a grand scale. Our benchmark is of course An American Werewolf in London, and I'm happy to say this remains the best transformation sequence, heck even the werewolf scene in Harry Potter was way better than this. I could go as far to say that I just wanted to give the teddy bear a big hug.The scenes were slapdash with poor continuity and the soundtrack was diabolically bad, it over rode the movie almost without exception trying for suspense where there was none and drowning out the actors to make for a 'why am I still sitting here' experience. With the effects and quality acting that is possible today I cannot believe that this movie could EVER be a hit.Please AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed, but the movie had a few merits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wolfman started out well. I enjoyed the atmosphere of the movie, and it seemed to be building towards something for the first thirty minutes or so, but then all of the sudden it lost its way with a lack of imagination and a predictable ending. That is why I can only give it a 5 out of 10 or in other terms about ** out of ****.THe plot is easy enough and follows a simple monster plot. Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) returns home after learning that his brother has disappeared. Once there he meets up with his strange father Sir John (Anthony Hopkins) and his brother's fiancé Gwen (Emily Blunt) who was the one that wrote to him telling him about what happened. Once home he learns that his brother was killed, and hears stories about a beast that might've caused it and that the Gypsies are to blame. Trying to learn of his brothers death, he visits the Gypsies and soon comes face to face with the beast which attacks him and passes the curse onto him. The rest of the story is pretty obvious from there, so I will say no more.I found myself getting into the movie, but then there is a secret that is exposed not even half way through the movie that becomes way to predictable and shatters any mystery that the movie might've had. I was expecting a little bit of imagination here, but it was not to be. Sadly this leads to a climax that is just plain ridiculous. The finale finds its way back a little bit, but it is not enough to save the movie.The acting at first seemed a little off, but it does improve somewhat though not enough. Anthony Hopkins has a few good lines which makes you think there is more to the story then what there really is. If you've seen the trailers, which give way too much away in my opinion, you will not be shocked where this movie eventually ends up going. Hugo Weaving, who plays an inspector hot on the tail of the beast, also has a few funny lines, but the one character that seemed to take this material more seriously and acted the best would be Emily Blunt's character. I reacted to her character more than any of the others.THe story itself was sort of choppy, and it bothered me somewhat. The first half hour of the movie and build up is still the best, but what follows goes where a monster movie of this caliber should never go, and it becomes silly and almost laughable. However, as I said before, the final few minutes redeem the story a little.I loved the atmosphere, and I was glad they went to a more Gothic setting. Some scenes, like the pub, and the sets reminded me of An American Werewolf in London and the original Wolf Man. There were even some themes in the movie taken from the 1962 Hammer Version of Curse of The Werewolf. I liked that the director used these scenes in this movie, but it's too bad he couldn't use more imagination to make the movie as a whole work much better. Disappointing, but not a complete failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A faint copy of a copy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright. When a pic is called 'The Wolfman', expectations aren't too high to begin with. But at least you expect an otherwordly atmosphere, a few thrilling scenes and, when Del Toro and Hopkins are involved, some decent acting. Nothing of the above was to be found in this faint copy of a copy. The dialogues were poorly written and Hopkins must have thought so as well, because he just rattles his lines as if only screentesting. Del Toro, as much as I adore him in others pics, is extremely miscast in this pic, having the same pained expression on his face in every scene. It's pretty safe to say the make-up artists won't win an Oscar either: Hopkins looks just like the character he played in Legends of the Fall, after the stroke, and Del Toro is wearing a wig which attracted my attention more then anything else. The only credit must be given to Hugo Weaving who, disregarding everything else, tried to make the best of his scenes. The storyline is not only predictable (which is not always a bad thing), its construction is painstakingly artificial which makes the characters look uncomfortable and implausible. As a result I could't care less about what happened to the characters and the scare-effects were lost to me. If anything, I had a few laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing a preview for this at the theater with a friend of mine, I remember leaning over to her and stating "that looks cheesy as hell." When it arrived in theaters...I smartly avoided it, saving my viewing of it for it's recent "Cinemax" premier. I'm glad.The star power is there...so how did this manage to go horribly wrong? Well, some of the opening shots of the landscape, etc., and the Gothic gray tone are alright. But it quickly delves into a convoluted, snooze inducing, borefest.Supposedly Del Toro was on board and gung ho about the project since 2006. Really? You couldn't tell. Del Toro looks and sounds bored, and delivers a more wooden performance than Pinnochio. Hopkins likewise seems to phone in his performance, not much can be said about him as he exudes about as much excitement as a stagnant puddle. Normally I enjoy him a great deal, when this movie ended there was little that I could remember about him other than he played the Harmonica and hated his sons. I felt sorry for Hugo Weaving as it seems he at least tried to be interested in his role...(the only one who seemed to be) but sadly he is underutilized as a generic Scotland yard inspector. It almost seemed about halfway through he realized what a horrible error he had made accepting this role.There was no chemistry between any of the leads, the "love" story (if you could even call it that) felt forced, and Del Toro and Blunt had zero chemistry. Blunt herself, was terrible. She never seems sorry, or mournful, or shocked at the horrible death of her fiancé. Half hearted pleas of "stay with me." Seemed to solidify her non chalantness of the situation at hand.I wondered how it was possible to make a movie about werewolves boring. Brother is killed by werewolf, other brother returns, other brother and dad don't like each other, other brother is bit, becomes werewolf, father is werewolf also, they fight, house burns down, other brother wins, other brother is killed, numerous flashbacks to mother's death, and other scenes you care nothing about. There's also some crap thrown in about Hopkins's werewolf origin as he stumbles across Gollum in a cave some years earlier and is bitten. Seriously? All the CGI computer guys you had at work on this, and this is the best looking thing they could come up with? A LOTR rip off?There's no redemption for any character, nor did I care about what happened to any of them, every single situation is predictable, the outcome...just as predictable, CGI is overused, cheap looking, and horribly fake, (werewolves look like furbies) and the ratio of werewolf screen time vs. human story screen time is vastly off balance. Gore is over the top and pointless. How many times do you need to see people beheaded, organs ripped from bodies, limbs ripped, throats gouged, and claws impaling through things before you figure out that the werewolves are "really bad guys" with zero characteristics, attitudes, or personalities outside of ripping apart people, nor do they seem of any intelligence as they never seem to be able to weed out "bad" people from innocent bystanders. This combined with cardboard cutout human characters give the audience nothing to latch onto or cheer for. (Did you feel the least bit bad or upset when Del Toro's werewolf was killed? No? Neither did I.)Del Toro's werewolf also displays nothing different from the werewolf persona of his father or any other werewolf in this hot mess. What a dragging, depressing, joyless, lame, poorly scripted movie, and a waste of actors who have genuine talent. Avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gory, gory hallelujah! This remake of a classic, that's been forever in the making, has finally arrived! Admittedly, I became aware of this film rather late in the game (ie. last year) and was unaware of all the troubles surrounding it. I think that if I'd been anxiously awaiting the release of this film as long as others have, I'd be quite a bit disappointed with the final result. As it stands, this film isn't at all 'bad', it's just that it's not quite up to the standard I'm sure a lot of people were hoping for.The performances are all good, though not "outstanding". Benicio Del Toro, as Lawrence Talbot, is thankfully not as mumble-y as he usually is (although his accent is questionable). He does portray his character quite well, especially when he lets loose the monster within. Whilst not having a lot of time for character development devoted to him, he still manages to create a person who you can feel sympathy for. The character of Gwen Conliffe, who could have simply been a damsel in distress (and a rather lifeless one at that), is actually very well-portrayed by Emily Blunt, who gives the character some real depth/emotion. She does a good job as the heroine of the story. The scenes between her and Lawerence go a ways towards making you actually *care* what happens with them, which is important. These two actors are quite good together. While some may have found their scenes "slow", I thought they were important, as they helped us get a better understanding of their characters. Given what little character development is in this movie, I thought those scenes between the two were needed.Anthony Hopkins, meanwhile, seems a tad bored in his role as Sir John Talbot. He does give good underlying menace, but doesn't seem to have much 'life' to him. Also, the "secret" of his character and the mystery surrounding his wife/Lawrence's mother isn't exactly hard to figure out (even if you hadn't already seen the trailers). It's pretty clear early on how this film is going to play out. I can't say there were too many surprises, story-wise (although there's quite a few surprises in the 'jump-scare' sense). Inspector Aberline (played by Hugo Weaving and his muttonchops), sounding very Agent Smith-like in his line deliveries, is one of the only characters - if not the ONLY character - to provide anything approaching 'humour' in the film. Suffice to say, this movie is virtually ALL seriousness.Which brings me to one of the film's flaws: the use of CGI. Although the thing on everybody's minds is no doubt how the transformations from man to wolf look (they're not half bad), the misuse of CGI mainly comes in the form of ordinary animals. There's a dodgy-looking CGI bear and deer, and given what lengths this movie went to towards conveying a sense of 'realism' - despite the unreality of the story itself - it's a shame to see somewhat laughable CGI animals used in place of real life ones. And, yes, unfortunately even 'Wolf Boy' from the trailers makes a few appearances. The Wolfman transformations themselves are well-done, and Rick Baker's excellent Wolfman makeup does a good job of turning Del Toro into a monster (Anthony Hopkins, on the other hand, kind of just looks like an extremely hairy old man). As for the violence...gorehounds should be quite satisfied, as all manner of torn limbs and guts are on show here. The scenes involving the Wolfman attacking people are really quite exhilarating. And once they're over, they leave you with a sense of uneasiness, as you don't quite know when something's going to suddenly lash out and rip a person to shreds. What lifts this film from mediocre (mostly) is the direction. The mood is well and truly set from the opening, and the directing goes a long way towards setting the right sort of atmosphere needed. The film looks great, nice use of shadows (although it could have done with a little less candle-blowing/lighting). The end credits were visually interesting and the music used throughout added to the overall feel of the film.Those expecting non-stop carnage might be somewhat disappointed, as there's more to this film than just simply blood/gore. Thankfully, the movie doesn't over-stay its welcome/drag on longer than it needed to. The ending will have people divided, I'm sure (although I was happy enough with it). This is by no means a bad movie, nor is it a remarkable one. Having said that, despite its flaws, it is still one of the better werewolf movies in recent years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything a (Monster)kid could want!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes, especially of horror films, generally tend to fall into three categories: 1)Crap. 2)Improvement. 3)Ones which improve on some things, but aren't so effective at others. This film is a textbook example of #3; it manages to come up with a remarkably clever twist on the original's plot which ties together a lot of disparate elements of the original and fleshes out character back-story. But it also fails at capturing the magic of the original's themes, or comes up with great new ideas, but does little with them. For example, here we are given a plausible back-story for Larry Talbot(Benicio Del Toro, who looks like a cross between Lon Chaney Jr &amp; Oliver Reed)'s estrangement from his father, Sir John(something only vaguely explained in the original), a traumatic event in his childhood which builds up sympathy for him, and a plausible reason for why everyone dislikes and suspects him(he was once committed to an asylum in his youth). But the pathos Lon Chaney Jr built up in the original was based off of how no one believed him and thought he was insane; here, he gets caught after his first night out! A major theme in the original, subtly handled(not often you can say subtle discussing a Universal horror film)was how Sir John was inadvertently the film's real villain for his terrible parenting; here, Sir John flat out IS the villain!!! Another example of this problem comes from this version's handling of Larry's romance with Gwen(Emily Blunt); it comes up with a plausible reason for why she falls in love with him so swiftly(she was engaged to his deceased brother, who he reminds her of), but their romance doesn't come into play until late into the film, so no one really cares by that point.These aren't the film's only flaws either; Benicio Del Toro is a fine actor, and he manages to capture Larry's suffering and lifetime of hardships, but he doesn't get to do anything else before he's bitten and becomes a werewolf. In the original, we got to know and like Larry, who was a horny, fun loving, not-too-bright, but likable fish-out-of-water. It was what made his fate all the more tragic. While I'm not saying that Del Toro is not as good an actor as Chaney Jr(Jr never could compete with his famous father in the acting department), he doesn't get a chance to make us get to know or give a crap about Larry other than: 'His life sucks, he's depressed'. Like I said, this isn't a slam against Del Toro, but he doesn't get a chance to turn in a really good performance. His dialog delivery also sucks; he's one of those actors who can emote excellently, but always flubs his lines. The film is also too fast-paced at times; this is literally a "blink and you'll miss it" sort of film.Inspite of these flaws, the film still works as an out and out monster bash. For anyone who grew up as a "Monster Kid" in the 60's and 70's who made up their own monster scenarios in their head; this is everything they ever liked about Universal, Hammer(yes I know they made only one werewolf film) and Paul Naschy's werewolf films rolled into one. I can safely say that in terms of action, monster-design, atmosphere and gore, this is the best werewolf movie ever made: It's what you wanted, but never got. And best of all, the werewolf isn't some lame CGI effect that looks like a walking dog(like the crappy 'werewolves' of "Underworld" etc.), it's an actual guy in makeup(the transformations are CGI though, but that I can forgive). That alone makes this film praise-worthy. I always find it more satisfying to actually have something in front of the camera. The high-point of the werewolf scenes is when Talbot transforms in front of a bunch of Nazi-like psychiatrists and slaughters them before going out and wrecking London(yes, this version is in London, not Wales).The atmosphere is great. The cinematography is the best I've seen in a modern film. It's like Mario Bava, Freddie Francis and Terrence Fisher(horror's greatest visually-oriented directors) all came back from the dead and collaborated on this. Every scene is like a painting. I'm definitely buying one of those "Art of" books for this movie.The murder sequences are also awesome. My favorite is when a guy gets stuck in a bog while fleeing from the Wolf Man; He tries to kill himself, but his gun is jammed, so the Wolf Man decapitates him in one swipe. That alone is worth seeing the film for.The acting is also good, Hugo Weaving is great as hypocritical police inspector Aberline(former foe of Jack the Ripper), this guy is one of those lawman antagonists you love to hate. Anthony Hopkins(as Sir John), as usual, steals the show. Whoever it was playing Maleva the gypsy was good too, I just wish she was given more screen-time, Maleva was my favorite character in the original.Not great art, and certainly flawed, but a fun thrill ride for lovers of classic horror. I just wish that Paul Naschy(aka. Jacinto Molina), who starred in many werewolf films in his native Spain, had lived to see it(he died last year). I dedicate this review to him.~</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Studio Has Had Its Claws Into This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give it four for its excellent Gothic atmosphere, but this is a film that is markedly inferior to the 1941 original. You would think Universal would be more careful with its treasure chest of monsters, but after duffing up The Mummy they've not done well by their hairiest monster. I won't go into the story much, other than to say it somewhat resembles the original but has many major changes.Firstly, where the hell is the pathos? Benicio Del Toro is a boring leading man; he can't come close to Lon Chaney Jr's engaging and tragic Larry Talbot. With little interest in the fate of the top-billed actor, the film descends into something of a slog. What's the point of having Talbot be an actor, anyway? Well, he gets to wear a poncey actors hat at the beginning...The gypsies, unlike the original, seem to have no dramatic purpose in the film at all. They do possess a rather alarmingly bad CGI bear, that looks like it was animated around 1986 or so. But more crucially, the transformations from man into wolf are also achieved with CGI. These are much better, but still ineffective. If you've seen the werewolf transformations in Harry Potter, etc, you've got the idea. American Werewolf In London did it so much better.There's much evidence of studio cutting, probably in an attempt to speed up the pace. In the second half of the movie the thing jumps around to distraction. How on earth does Talbot get to Gwen's antique shop? How does he even know where it is? Why is Inspector Abbeline, he of the Jack The Ripper murders, dragged in? He gets a nice scene in the local pub, but largely contributes nothing. Similary, one moment Emily Blunt's character is taken away by the police, for no good reason at all I might add, next she's boning up on Lycanthropy, digesting lots of tomes on the subject. Maybe she got 'em from the local Werewolf Of London Library. SPOILERS HERE&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Anthony Hopkins gives a restrained, excellent performance. But his character is a total cypher, his motivations unbelievable and rather obscure. If he enjoys being a werewolf so much why does he have his servant lock him away every full moon for 25 years? Why does he kill the poor guy at the end? Art Malik plays the ethnic stereotype in question. Another pointless role as all he has to do his polish his pistols. His cleaning skills are not really up to scratch!We have lots of jump cuts and sudden noises. Have fun spotting when they are going to happen. 9 times out of 10 you'll be right. The one with the dog near the end is rather clever, though. The same can not be said for the twist. If this is the first movie you've ever seen, you might not spot it coming from about 5 minutes in.So, sorry Universal, you need to take a good long look at what made your classic monsters so popular and so memorable. And maybe try again sometime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A confused and trite waste of time. Is it a Gothic drama? Is it a gore-laden jumper? Is it a comedy? How the heck do great actors end up in garbage like this? A by-the-numbers Hollywood "horror"--as in horrible script, horrible pacing, horrible rip off of the music from Bram Stoker's Dracula. It's like the entire movie is all window dressing with nothing inside. Just because the actors furrow their brows doesn't mean there is any emotional connection between the audience and the characters. Like several IMDb reviewers have written: Stick with American Werewolf in London. Okay, I do admit two things, 1) The movie looks great, and 2) It's now part of my regular rotation of fun stupid movies to put on in the background.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The making of a turgid flop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the seemingly interminable "unrated edition" of this boring claptrap on DVD before committing this judgement to paper. In my opinion, this film is the unfortunate product of a Hollywood film industry that has no future because it keeps trying to reinterpret and recycle its past glories. The only way it can do this is to use ever more sophisticated but lifeless technological means to render the gore gorier and the noise noisier while paying no attention to the other aspects of film entertainment that are logic, structure, continuity, viewer involvement, intelligence, wit, humour, deft touches, originality and creative power.Everything about this film is derivative. Its photography, rhythm, lighting, art direction and best effects are all imitated from F.F. Coppola's "Bram Stoker's Dracula" with the major exception that Coppola's film wasn't shot in this generic blue-green half-assed washed-out imitation of a two-strip Technicolor film, a yawn-inducing conceit borrowed from every other horror film produced in the last 10 years. It is high time that CGI technicians leave their mother's basement and learn once and for all what real sunlight looks like. The overall effect is as depressing as the overdone CGI landscapes in "Van Helsing", the very nadir of this kind of artificial entertainment. The only film this one is NOT derivative of, actually, is the original 1941 "The Wolfman" script by Curt Siodmak.The film fails in logic in many ways. One of them is casting Benicio Del Toro not only as an Englishman but as an aristocratic Englishman who is also a Shakespearian actor. The man can hardly speak recognizable syllables in any language, let alone recite English verse. Why hire him if the wolfish part of his role is all done in CGI? Because he is one of the producers. The other star of the film is Anthony Hopkins channeling once again the role of Professor Von Helsing from the aforementioned Coppola film. In this outing he has pushed all his acting tics to unbearable levels and has definitely taken Kate Hepburn's advice too much to heart when she told him "Don't act ? just speak your lines" on the set of "The Lion in Winter". There is no acting here. Just monotonous drivel. The efforts of Hugo Weaving and Emily Blunt are totally wasted in this context.The intelligence of any viewer willing to give this pabulum its chance is totally alienated in the first 20 minutes when he is asked to believe that the hero, after refusing Gwen's invitation to help seek his missing brother in England, leaves for America on a theatre tour and is then summoned back by a letter written by the same woman, thus making it at least four months between the brother's disappearance and the discovery of his body, given the transportation modes of 1891. We are also asked to believe that Talbot's giant castle is run by only one Indian servant. The level of graphic violence in this film may be its only original element although I am not versed enough in sadistic mayhem at the movies to form a definite opinion. But it certainly was the first time for me seeing the actual contours of the various human organs ripped from a living human body. The London cityscapes are also very well done and would have been fun to watch in any other film. The best of these, showing a masked ball at the Crystal Palace, has been cut from the film and can only be seen in the DVD's deleted scenes, unfortunately.More derivation: Danny Elfman was certainly the man to write music for this type of film. He unfortunately doesn't have a single original descending minor chord left in his arsenal and his score sounds like a rehash of many, many such outings (but especially Wojciech Kilar's themes for "Bram Stoker's Dracula") while dangerously bordering at times on that twilight zone where noise meets sound effects. The beginning and end titles look suspiciously like the ones for Mel Brooks' satirical "Dracula Dead and Loving It".In short, one has to be a particular type of idiot not to be able to make something inspiring and scary from the raw material of foggy and shadowy English moors, decrepit castles and ancient legends about werewolves. The film ends the only way it can: with a particularly gruesome WWE-type confrontation (although those are usually better scripted) followed by a recreation of the final scene from (you guessed it) "Bram Stoker's Dracula" and a just few added clichés for good measure.P.S.: What was Max Von Sydow doing in an uncredited cameo as the man who leaves his cane to the hero? Could it be he didn't want his name associated with this film either?</fullReview>

The only explanation that I can figure out is that those people watched it with a lot of expectations and they did not found what they were looking for, or they just went to see that movie being in the wrong mood? I must admit that I had to watch it twice in order to give it a 10 out of 10. The first time I gave a 7. The second time I really watched it with a clear mind and I really was able to appreciate each frame of it? The actors are perfect, the camera framing is a delight to watch, the costumes are fabulous and each line of the script is well written.

		<fullReview>Don't bother with this one. The story is very bad and unpleasant. Without giving away too much it lacks romance or a real hero or a real villain. It has an unsatisfying plot. Needed lots of rewriting. The good points: The production has a really good 19th Century feel - a throwback to good old Dracula movies. Great art direction. The makeup is good - no wonder it won an Oscar. The cast is top notch. Benicio is always intense and convincing. Emily is right for the role not too glam or pretty. Hopkins is okay for the silly role he has.What a waste of a big budget. How could they make such an expensive movie with such a bad story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, Boring &amp; More Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has to be the most boring, tiresome, sleepy, predictable horror film of the past ten years. "The Wolfman" comes with no story, no thrills, no scary moments, and with some questionable technical aspects, but only the special effects and the wonderful makeup job by Rick Baker almost saved this film of being the worst in recent days. It doesn't have one interesting thing in it to make you thrilled, excited, moved, provoked by it. Nothing!Time and time again I found myself blinking my eyes trying to stay awake while watching this worthless waste of space, money and time. I couldn't buy the idea of Benicio Del Toro dragged into that world, and not even Anthony Hopkins trying to imitate himself with a presence that reminded me of his wonderful role in "Bram Stoker's Dracula", and the fact is I'm tired of seeing reducing his career to be a starring role in special effects based movies when we all know he's better in things full of life like "Nixon", "The Remains Of the Day", "The Silence of the Lambs" and the list can go forever. But lately all he's been doing is things like this.Joe Johnston made better things with "October's Sky", "Jurassic Park 3" (yes I like this!), and "Honey I Shrunk the Kids", but "The Wolfman" has nothing good to see, nothing original to show and it only wasted good actors and lots of money. Just in case you think this is a useless film it's not, it's a great suggestion for those with insomnia problems. After 15 minutes of watching you'll be sleeping, quietly, dreaming of great horror films you might have watched during your entire life that doesn't resemble this rotten thing. 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No spoilers.Briefly, I must say this film exceeded my expectations. The role of father and son in the original film, as played by Lon Chaney, Jr and Claude Raines, was key to Talbot's tragedy. Here, Johnston and company have successfully upped the ante, and the father/son relationship becomes pivotal. The film asks where is the line between beast and man?; but I think it's really trying to say "When do children become their own person? Where does that line lie?" And how much fun to see Abberline back at work? Wonderful and highly recommend, especially to fans of Classic Universal Horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wolfman is awfully predictable and badly executed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watch a movie, I like to see something new. That was not the case with The Wolfman. This movie is predictable every step of the way. Within the first 10 minutes, I had guessed the rest of the story correctly.Plus, the cheap scare tactic throughout the movie. Those moments where it was serene then suddenly the monster appear with a loud sound. There are plenty of them and my goodness there were not only annoying, but also predictable. You see, this movie has so many of them that you can tell when the next one is coming from.Then the hole in logic. Ahh yes, every movie has them. But this one has gone above the norm. It seems a lot of the actions taken by the characters were simply just so it will fit the next scene, not because it's what a thinking human being will do.Did I mention the horrible script? Dialogues were sub par at best and mostly laughable. The actors' performance couldn't really lift the snooze fest that is this movie.I will recommend this movie for young teens looking for some cheap thrill. Otherwise, stay away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad script, bad effects, dull protagonist, impotent antagonists, total absence of tone, lack of suspense and horror... Doesn't even work as a drama.It reminded me a bit of Coppola's 'Dracula'. That one too was quite unimpressive, albeit still miles ahead of this pile of garbage. They forgot a cardinal rule: don't show the monster. And with effects like these (they remind me of Scooby Doo), you really want to keep that beast hidden as much as possible. Did I see Gollum in some of the shots? Another cardinal rule they forgot is that you need compelling characters and that the antagonists need to be credible. In this film there is no antagonist at all.Rule number three: don't confuse the audience with inconsistent tone. You can't start with a grim, sinister tone, maintain it for twenty minutes, and then switch to what seems like a parody of werewolf movies in the gypsy camp. I expected Mel Brooks to pop out of one of those tents. And then came the drama... The revelations of dark secrets, the philosophical musings of his cursed father, and so on. That doesn't work, not only because it is poorly written, but because the film has already failed as a horror story (which it promised implicitly), and confused us with the tone. After all these disappointments you expect the audience to listen to some drivel about a troubled past? I choose to stop ranting at this point because this film simply doesn't deserve even a good rant. It deserves to be forgotten in record time - which already has happened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By now, you probably know this was ruined in production and a near-complete misfire. It isn't that bad, at least has some decent gore.The problem is Universal went from Mark Romanek in the director's chair to a one-time protégé of George Lucas, an efficient man completely without personal vision. Everything else is simply collateral to having at the helm someone who only wants to get a job done backed by a studio that doesn't care beyond receipts.The idea I suppose was to recapture some of Coppola's Dracula dark filigree on a big scale, but it seems no one can whip up the passion to do so. Del Toro looks game, but everything around him -most notably Hopkins and CGI London- looks tired and obvious.The original was old-fashioned fantasy on the monster level when it came out, but there was still room for psychological wiggle so far as characterization. The American public was still being acclimatized to Freud's ideas - already outdated by that time. And it is interesting to note that those curses - here, Dracula, Cat People - were supposedly infiltrating the civilized world from places that really lived in those times in a sort of magical reality, usually the broader Balkan region where I write this from. Londoners of the time could content themselves that there were truly dark spots in the map of human knowledge.You have none of that now so it seems even more stale. Clue of short-sightedness on the part of the makers is that a lot of the emotional power is mined from contrived Freudian ideas, those same ideas which are openly made fun of in the asylum demonstration scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak character development, plot and script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into The Wolfman with no pre-conceived notions or ideas. I have not seen The Wolf Man (1941) which this film was based off of &amp; didn't know anything about the story, about lycanthropy (werewolves) &amp; the movie does little to educate the viewer about the basics. Throughout the entire film, there was a lot of focus on silver bullets and yet never an explanation as to why. It took me reading IMDb's FAQ to understand that werewolves can only be killed by silver bullets - it would have been nice for someone, anyone in the movie to actually explain that to the viewers but then again, the script was an utter mess.The main problem with this film is that it's empty of true emotion. The scenery is fabulous and the Victorian-Era backdrop in 1891 England lends itself to a Gothic-horror feel that really suits the picture. The look is fabulous but the actual content leaves a lot to be desired. The character development is criminally neglected - especially Emily Blunt's character of Gwen. We are often told of connections and feelings but never really shown them, making it almost impossible to care about the characters, the supposed bonds and of course connect with anyone on screen.Gwen's fiancé, Ben Talbot goes missing &amp; she seeks out his older brother Lawrence Talbot, played by Benicio Del Toro, a well known theater actor who moved away years earlier, for help. At first he rejects her request, having committed himself to a contract for 30 upcoming shows of a Shakespearean play, but after a letter from her, he is apparently convinced and returns to his hometown/ childhood estate to reunite w/ his Father (Anthony Hopkins) and find his brother. Ben's body is found with wounds that only a monster could have inflicted and the story goes from there..This movie is filled with fantastic actors but Del Toro &amp; Hopkins seemed like they were bored/phoning it in and Blunt did the best with what she was given but her character was very underdeveloped. When her fiancé, Ben, was found savagely murdered, aside from a 30 second subtly tearful scene when she is brought his belongings, there is really nothing to convey her devastation or mourning. I certainly didn't feel her pain or really care about Ben or her loss. Even worse and less developed though is the supposed relationship between Lawrence, Ben's older brother, and Gwen. Benicio Del Toro &amp; Emily Blunt have no chemistry whatsoever - there is about a 16 year age difference between them and it shows. Don't worry though - there is no suffering through chemistry lacking intimate scenes since their 'connection' is barely shown on screen &amp; given how important it is to the end of the film, it's unforgivable and a product of sloppy writing/directing. I didn't get a 'love' vibe from Gwen/Lawrence at all and any growing feelings between them were not properly portrayed. It was an utter failure.A big gripe I had with the storyline/plot was the way the hunt for the initial werewolf that killed Ben and numerous other villagers as well as infected Lawrence (he was bitten by a werewolf which transformed him into one) was dropped the second Lawrence began turning into the beast and the villagers/main detective (played by Hugo Weaving) focused on him. Why did no one seem to care at all about finding the initial werewolf? Why was this dropped? Why did no one ever focus on or care about Lawrence's father especially after Lawrence had called him a 'monster' &amp; his claims about himself being a true monster had been proved correct once the full moon came and many witnessed the transformation?Be prepared for a big twist about who the initial werewolf who tormented the villagers, killed Ben and infected Lawrence really is as well as one about Lawrence's deceased mother... only you will see both coming a mile away like most of the plot which makes it a failure like most of the film.Also, look out for a cheesy to the death fight scene between 2 werewolves that is nothing but a CGI overload. I was amazed to read that actual wolf costumes/makeup were used since some of the scenes look incredibly computer generated and fake. The fight scene at the end looks like something you would find in a video game or some computer made re-enactment - it was ridiculous. Even the backdrop in the fight scene that they did have a real set for looked like a CGI green screen. It was awful. I will say that the transformations looked good but some of the action sequences did not.Lastly, it took me Googling how often a full moon occurs to find out that on average, there is one every month which was shocking because it seemed like in the movie, every other night there was another full moon. I had no idea such amounts of time were passing by - perhaps they should have spent a non full moon night actually developing the characters but alas, that is not what this movie wanted to be - which is why everyone was so wooden and the movie was so empty of real emotion.4/10 for great scenery and a nice Gothic-horror feel but the actual movie is horrible. The characters, especially the Gwen/Lawrence relationship, which comes into play later on in the film, is underdeveloped and practically non existent making the ending fail on every level. Don't tell me that he loves her to the point where only she can speak to his heart &amp; get through to the man underneath the beast- SHOW me. Where was the build up? Poorly done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Quote Statler and Hilton in The Muppet Movie: "Soap leaves a better film than this"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would love to overpraise this film like so many have done on this site, unfortunately I can't. The Wolfman relies too much on "cool" special effects (unfortunately inclusive of CGI in the transformation scenes)and not enough time on the script, which is woefully inept. The original script was extremely well written but due to the short running time, had to skimp on a lot of details. With the budget and talent allotted to the remake, an attempt should have been made to expand on the original script as it was written and then layer on the cool effects. Instead the story is "reinvented" by individuals lacking the knowhow to make it work, it's a bomb all the way. Shame on all involved for this abomination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreary, cynical and humorless horror film with the usual weak story, uninteresting characters and bland dialogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This latter-day Universal Horror about a Victorian-age werewolf (or two), directed by Joe Johnston and starring Benicio del Toro and Anthony Hopkins, is pretty much what you'd expect from a modern blockbuster horror. The story, characterizations and especially the dialogue (God, modern dialogue is so bland) are weak. All the real ingenuity goes into the art direction and cinematography (which maintain a relentless dreariness throughout), the special effects, gore and varied methods of killing off characters. The final battle between two werewolves would seem a lot less idiotic if the movie had had a sense of humor (like the similar Universal monster mashes from the 1940s); but the film is so cynical and self-serious that it's merely a risible eye-roller.The screenplay was adapted from the vastly superior Curt Siodmak script for the 1940 film. With the success of movies like "Paranormal Activity," isn't it time we took these supernatural thrillers out of super-duper-hyper-overdrive? The Siodmak film has no gore, a small body count and human-scale action scenes; and it also has an engrossing story, sympathetic characters and literary dialogue. I'd rather have that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Atmosphere Let Down By Screenplay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE WOLFMAN is one of these films that you know is going to be a great disaster long before you see it . Directed by Joe Johnston a typical Hollywood journey man type of director the film's initial release was supposed to at the tail end of 2007 but was pushed back several times and released in Febuary 2010 where it was met by lukewarm reviews . Its cause wasn't helped that the main criticism was a disjointed , underdeveloped screenplay but now that the DVD has been released with an additional 17 minutes could THE WOLFMAN be rehabilitated ? It's not a bad film but you are left with the impression the screenplay has either been rewritten to death or lacks a couple of rewrites . The story is an affectionate homage to both the original 1941 film written by Curt Siodmak and to the old Universal and Hammer horror films of yesteryear along with concessions to post Hayes code gore that you expect from a modern horror . There's even a post modern reference to American Werewolf In London the wolfman going on a killing spree in London which involves a road accident with a steam driven London bus Where the film is less successful is developing characters . There's Lawrence Talbot who is an émigré from his ancestral land but this lacks the subtext of Siodmak's original screenplay . There's his father Sir John Talbot who harbours a dark family secret , , Inspector Abberline of Scotland Yard who is investigating series of horrific murders and Gwen Conliffe the erstwhile fiancé of the late Ben Talbot who was found savagely murdered . They're one dimensional characters whilst most of the supporting characters are mainly there as werewolf fodder , but perhaps it's best to be charitable in saying this is more to do with homage with old horror films . It is noticeable that like the original wolfman movie the story is set in Wales but no one speaks with a Welsh accent . Could it be that international audiences would have found the accent too incomprehensible ? Benecio Del Toro should make a good werewolf on paper . He does have a sort of animal magnetism about him but he's maybe too much of an outsider to successfully bring Lawrence Talbot to life . Talbot should be at the heart of the story , someone the audience should take to in an everyman sort of way but he lacks of a vulnerability . He'd make a fantastic Lord Byron or Dracula but comes across as someone who's dangerous by nature which goes against what the human Talbot should be . Hopkins is rather disappointing . He is undoubtedly one of the greatest film actors of the 20th Century but we're now ten years in to the 21st Century and you get the feeling there's a very good reason why we've seen so little of Hopkins in the last decade . All the other members of the cast are effective and are merely let down by the aforementioned faults in the script That said it's certainly a movie where the producers have gone all out for atmosphere with dark foggy exteriors shot on a backstge with superb production design and art direction and the CGI effects aren't really noticeable except sadly in the final battle between father and son . Hopefully we'll see more of these reimaginings of classic horror films as long as someone puts more thought in to the screenplay</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Movie Of All Time...One Of Cinema's Greatest Under-Appreciated Masterpieces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With my reviews, I often share some very unpopular opinions. I've given extremely negative ratings/reviews to some beloved movies and extremely positive ratings/reviews to some unpopular ones. Out of all the heavily criticized and critically panned films I've rated/reviewed, "The Wolfman" is the best by far. I'll even go out of my way and call it one of the greatest films ever made. As you can see by the title, it's without a doubt my favorite movie of all time.The film centers on three characters; Lawrence, Sir John and Gwen. All three characters are extremely deep, developed and relatable, and there is a bit of each of them in all of us. Lawrence Talbot is a Shakespearean actor of the civilized world, haunted by his horrific and violent childhood in the natural world of his father. Lawrence starts off as a dismissive and cold figure, but in the face of tragedy and his nightmarish affliction, he becomes more compassionate, courageous and emotionally open throughout the course of the film. He represents the potential for growth in character and strength in faith in the face of tragedy, even in the face of the temptation of our inner beast. He represents a hybrid of both the natural and the civilized world, a man who has suffered the cruelty of both. (The Wolfman in the case of the natural world and the barbaric Asylum in which he is "treated" in the civilized one) Gwen Conliffe was the fiancé of Lawrence's slain brother, a refined lady of the civilized world who understands not Lawrence's hardships or the nature of the natural world of Lawrence's origin. Like Lawrence, she becomes far more loving and proactive over the course of the movie, showing how in the face of tragedy, we must be strong and proactive to help the ones who care about us. Sir John Talbot represents a far more cautionary tale; a man purely of the natural world, Sir John is a weak willed man and a coward who gives into the temptation of the beast within him, destroying everything he loves and cares about. He represents what we could become if we are not strong in the face of tragedy, and if we do not resist temptation.Benicio Del Toro is fantastic as Lawrence Talbot, the man doomed to become The Wolfman. Del Toro does an excellent job playing a cold, tortured and frightened man who increasingly becomes more tortured, but also more emotional and kind over the course of the film. His facial acting is outstanding, he does an excellent job portraying a wide range of emotions; love, angst, fear, somberness, nostalgia. I really do think the man deserved an Oscar for this role.Emily Blunt does a similarly excellent job as Gwen Conliffe. She adds so much emotion and heart to this film it's incredible. She does a great job portraying the sincerity, determination, lovingness and conviction required of the character.Finally, we have Anthony Hopkins as Sir John Talbot, and like Blunt and Del Toro, he does an excellent job playing the character of Sir John. He gives the character a touch of sympathy and humanity, and buckets of creepiness. I never saw the twist about his character coming, though this review may unintentionally spoil it. If so, I apologize.The look of the movie is almost as captivating as the writing. "The Wolfman" transported me to a different world with its lovely sets, lighting and atmosphere; a grand Victorian world of beauty and terror. The movie provides us with some excellent, stunning, memorable shots that I will never forget; from a gorgeous sunset over the moors overlooking Talbot Hall, to a shot of The Wolfman howling on a gargoyle overlooking all of London, to The Wolfman gazing at the moon underneath the London Bridge. And what would "The Wolfman" be without...Well, a Wolfman? And my oh my did this film give us a good Wolfman. The Wolfman here looks spectacular. Not only is the design itself wonderful and a loving homage to the original Wolf Man design, but I applaud the director for deciding to go with practical monster makeup effects instead of a CGI cartoon. The Wolfman feels like he's really there, stalking you in the forests of Blackmoor.Many times in Sci-Fi/Fantasy movies, I feel that the romance stories are forced, unnecessary and not the least bit emotionally engaging. Not at all here. "The Wolfman" is a beautiful love story as well as a compelling thriller, these really are two characters who you feel truly need each other. They both give each other strength, they are truly there for each other in some downright horrific times. Even when Lawrence is made the village outcast (Not just for his affliction, but for his identity as a half-Gypsy), Gwen is still there for him. Hell, one could argue that during Lawrence's suffering in Lambeth Asylum, it is his love for Gwen that keeps him sane and saves his life. Del Toro and Blunt have fantastic chemistry as well and I had no problem believing these two were in love.This film really manages to get in a powerful emotional punch. I saw myself and many of my loved ones in both Lawrence and Gwen, so when they suffered, I suffered with them. The themes and messages of the temptations of the inner beast, and betterment of oneself in times of tragedy and unconditional love truly hit home for me. The ending confrontation of Gwen and The Wolfman truly had me bursting into tears, even for a little bit after the credits. For a movie called "The Wolfman", I did not expect that.This is a movie that I can watch 500 times and not get tired of, and the hate that its gotten really saddens me. It may not be the best movie of all time, but it's my all-time favorite and the most under-appreciated. Nigh flawless filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie Ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts out awful, the Wolfman looks so fake, I mean come on Hollywood you have all this technology at your finger tips but seem to trump up more times than not when it comes to making a decent noteworthy movie. And, this has to be one of the worst performances by Benicio Del Toro ever. I felt like clawing my eyes out every time he opened his mouth. Where you reading a teleprompter the entire time you were filming this movie. He was as lively as a corpse. I mean the entire movie felt like a rehearsal, this was such a waste of a title character. Maybe, if they had paired Anthony Hopkins with someone who could actually act, then it might, MIGHT, have been fairly tolerable but what a waste of a title character. I vote this movie to end up on Mystery Science Theater because this would be the ONLY time this movie would be worth watching,its really that bad. Also, the movie was very Hollywood and poorly done. I shut the movie off half way through and immediately placed it back in the envelope. Don't watch this movie its a total waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beast will out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a key theme present in The Wolfman that takes it beyond mere b- movie into a film with more complexity than initially meets the eye. This theme is explored throughout the film's imagery, performance, casting, and through the narrative itself. Indeed, as an examination of the battle between nature and civilisation, the film transcends normative genre convention and becomes a commentary on the human condition that spans the emotional, the rational, the intellectual, the spiritual, the civil, and the natural. At first glance, the casting of Benicio Del Toro might seem odd; a Mexican/Hispanic man, playing a London thespian? However, this choice merely reflects, and draws upon the film's central theme. On one hand, rugged and almost animal-like, and on the other, a Shakespearian actor. Drawing on cultural stereotypes, the passion of the Hispanic is clearly weighed against the refinement of Victorian London. Indeed, the dignified profession of the thespian necessarily involves an understanding of refined performance - itself evidence of the mastery of intellect and control over the display of chaotic raw emotion. Certainly, Del Toro's presence as an actor is dominating and he plays the role of the thespian in a way that puts much separation from a wolf or a feral man as possible. With an intellectual campness to the performance, he maintains a very worldly and educated tone to the character - all of which is a very dramatic contrast to what he is about to experience and become. Similarly, the character of Gwen (Emily Blunt), a delicate aristocratic woman from civilised means, is also one that suppresses the natural instinct - or is at least fearful of it. In one scene she introduces herself to Lawrence (Del Toro) and asks for help concerning his brother. When she is confronted with the 'wild' party in Lawrence's dressing room, she reacts with shyness and retires quickly as her Victorian morality quickly takes hold. As well as being a love interest for Lawrence that helps to drive the plot, she is also a representation of the civilised world struggling to come to terms with its inherently uncivilised nature.The film is also littered with thematic imagery that explores this contradiction. John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins), with a furry white beard and gruff appearance, is himself very animal like and the writer cast him as someone with a notable interest in hunting. When we are introduced to him on screen there is a leopard skin draped around his neck and he brandishes a hunting rifle. His house is littered with the heads of animals and these hunting trophies act as material demonstrations of his power in the world of nature. Indeed, something very basic and undomesticated is at the core of the character. Meanwhile, it is clear that Lawrence ? with all the refinement that his occupation and position requires - has tried his hardest to break away from this paternal line. A debate over the dinner table amplifies this core conflict as Lawrence expresses his contempt for the villagers and their "wild ideas". Ominously, John Talbot retorts with "you dismiss the natural man at your peril". There is a structural framing of these conflicting themes within the narrative too. In the first half, Lawrence the civilised actor, ventures into the natural countryside of Blackmoor where the living is basic and the wild 'dark' country remains close; not to mention the primitive politics of the locals. In the second half, however, when Lawrence has become The Wolfman, the action relocates to London. The contrast provides a stark externalisation of his own inner conflict. As he struggles to subdue his own instincts, London's civilised world of intellectualism and endeavour struggles to contain the Wolfman that is stalking it from within. Indeed, there is a particular irony in the methods of the Doctors in Lambeth lunatic asylum. Although they allude to be modern, rational and civilised, the methods they employ are every bit as brutal as those of the Wolfman. Even amongst the apparently intellectual environment of the city, the seemingly inherent violence of man's nature is not as far from the surface as it would like to pretend. Equally, the character of Frances Aberline, the detective investigating the case ? intent on capturing, containing, and ultimately destroying the Wolfman - also represents the inherent contradiction in the apparently rational and the logical, and the violent and uncivilised. In terms of technological and industrial discovery and development, the Victorian society of the late 19th century setting was a key moment in the civilising process of human history. With the social and cultural etiquette that it brought, it was an attempt to refine, and even design out, man's inherent rough nature. This film is an examination of that battle. However, it is also symbolic of the on-going struggle we all have in attempting to quell our own base instincts against the over- arching morality of society. Seen in this context, the film is a very complex tragedy that examines the inherently contradictory state of the human condition and society itself. As such, and as a response to that struggle, the film goes much deeper than the mere ranks of a b-movie. "The beast will out", so to speak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully realised genre piece with the best CG birds I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what exactly I expected from this movie. Having seen a few of the older Hollywood wolfmen and also the Oliver Reed version I imagine I thought it would be an 'updated' vision, more akin to Ironman or perhaps some other of the more in-yer-face recent movies... Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes maybe.How wrong I was. Although The Wolfman is certainly well within the current cinematic zeitgeist for movie/literature re-visits, it manages to create something truly unique, as well as being quite beautiful to watch. It has a pace that takes it's time when necessary. Every shot is considered... falling leaves, lovely focus pulls, roads winding away, interesting frame compositions. Tim Burton could learn a lot from it. The trees are real. There's no over-arty exaggeration or 'personal vision'. In fact the story isn't played with at all. It's told straight, in a style reminiscent of the earlier versions, but with the added bonus of modern cinema technology in the hands of someone who knows precisely when and how much to use it.I have particular 'thing' about CG birds. Every CG landscape in virtually any movie made in the last decade 'has' to include CG birds. It's almost like the last thing that gets added to the shot. Just before the 'render now' button is pressed the animator shoves in the birds, sweeping majestically in from the side. I hate that. It just looks so contrived. In fact, until now, the best CG bird shot I had seen was the twittering couple emerging from one of the Argonath statues in Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring. But this has now been well and truly topped. There's a very brief shot of a boat passing beneath Tower Bridge in The Wolfman... and the birds around it are real. Fantastic, if it is indeed CG. Animators of the world, look and learn.I'm not a horror movie fan. I don't like gore movies much and I'm not a huge fan of Anthony Hopkins. Even Hannibal Lector didn't do it for me. The guy doing the killings was truly scary, Lector was joke. The Wolfman has changed all that. It has atmosphere by the bucketful, more gore than my local butcher's shop window and Anthony Hopkins delivers.And Benicio Del Toro is brilliant in this. His acting style is perfect for the character of Lawrence and he delivers an overall atmosphere of languid dread that pervades the entire film.Joe Johnston has created a wonderful, classic movie. It's devoid of the current 'short attention span' cinema tricks that make movies so disposable. It's superbly crafted and right from the opening credits, with the red titling that pay homage to the earlier films, it takes you somewhere else entirely, like every good adventure film should.Films don't need hundreds of gimmicks and sub plots and twists. It's OK to simply tell a story and tell it well. The Wolfman does just that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definitive Werewolf Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I am a harsh critic when it comes to horror movies, harsher than Ebert and Robert combined, but I love the original 1941 classic. It is up there with Dracula 1931, and Frankenstein 1931. The first 2 mummy movies by Stephan Sommers were great and King Kong was in my opinion the best movie of 2005. In 2006 when I heart of the remake of the Wolfman was being made, I was filled with joy. Remakes these days are unpopular and I understand why but the property of the Wolfman has never been remade. 4 years would pass by with news of loosing the original director, release dates, and insane months of post production to reach this moment. Here is my review... The story: The basic premise of the original is intact here, Lawrence Talbot is asked to comeback to his homeland after his brother disappears, only to be bitten by a werewolf and becomes one. Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self made an important decision, by making Lawrence more active in finding out what happened to his brother. The relationship between father and son being darker and more explored was a stroke of genius. The love story between Lawrence and Gwen may seem forced to some, but I found their fondness of each other growing naturally as the movie goes on. The way the movie ends is in some ways more tragic than King Kong 2005. A+ The cast: Benicio Del Toro as Lawrence Talbot/The Wolfman - In most if not all of Del Toro's movies, he plays manny supporting characters who have an edge. I was kind of skeptical when he was cast as Lawrence, but after viewing it. I can honestly say he delivered the best performance in the movie. His character requires him to be brooding, haunted and bewildered, but also make you care for him. It is very easy to see why everyone was confused as he appeared to be "sleep walking" in this role. If one looks closely, Del Toro's Talbot is psychologically tormented, but through all that he makes him heroic and that is because of his gravitas he puts into it. By the way his Werewolf scared the hell out of me. A+ Anthony Hopkins as Sir John Talbot - Hopkins and the writers wisely and respectfully chose not to follow Claude Rain's interpretation. Lawrence's father is cold and does not emote any emotion with grief or death. It is as he says in the movie " If you look into my eyes, you will see that Im quite dead" Hopkins as usual pulls it off but still amazingly manages to keep the viewer interested in his character. A Emily Blunt as Gwen Conliff - I will be honest, I was not expecting to have 0 care for the love interest, but after watching the movie,Wooooooooooooooooooooooow, was I dead wrong. Blunt managed to make me care about Gwen just as match as Lawrence. The chemistry between her and Del Toro was so strong it made me compare it to Batman and Catwoman in Batman Returns 1992. The writers also made her more of a key player in the finale act as she provides Lawrence, her true love his salvation. A+ Hugo Weaving as Inspector Francis Aberline - I knew Weaving would deliver a good performance, but I was not expecting him to be soo good, it makes me think why hasn't this man receive any Oscar yet. Weaving plays the outsider detective in a way that makes you hate him and like him at the same time. A+ The Direction: Although I am a hardcore horror fan but I do like kid films for what they are. When I heard the director of Jumanji and Hidalgo, Joe Johnston coming in as the new director. I was energized and excited. This is indeed his darkest film. Johnston made the transition to do rated R horror films with this. I was surprised that he chose to shoot it in a very classical manner but managed to make a dark epic. A+ The twist: Since I have been looking up this movie for 4 years I already knew that Sir John was the werewolf all along. The thing that I like about it is that it reminded me of Alvin and the chipmunks meet The wolfman, where Talbot hinted at a family curse, a nice homage to that. A+For me, it did not feel rushed at all and the scares are really chilling. The Wolfman is good combination of the original 1941 film, Curse of the Werewolf, American Werewolf in London, Werewolf of London and Alvin and the chipmunks meet The wolfman(with the twist of course).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dark misty moors, tall trees, and a full moon are the recipe to a werewolf movie such as this film, "American Werewolf In London", and of course, the original Lon Chaney film. Benicio Del Toro (always enigmatic) assumes the role of Lawrence Talbot, a British-born, but American raised actor who returns to his rundown English home after the brutal death of his brother, Ben. Lawrence is reunited with his estranged and eccentric father, John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins), and introduced to Ben's beautiful fiancé, Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt), in order to solve the mystery of Ben's death. While on the trail of searching for the killer, Lawrence is attacked by a werewolf and the curse is passed on to him causing him to be the prime suspect of Detective Frances Aberline aka the Hunter of Jack the Ripper (Hugo Weaving) leading the official investigation. The good news: excellent special effects and make up of the werewolf attacks. Some really good jolt scenes and some good performances. Del Toro is always versatile and it shows in all of his performances including this one which has to rely on special effects and make up. Personally, I loved the scenes he shared with the luminous Emily Blunt, who portrays the character of Gwen Conliffe with sympathy and vulnerability without turning her into a simpering damsel in distress. Blunt and Del Toro to my surprise had wonderful chemistry. The bad news: the direction of the film was choppy and rushed. Anthony Hopkins is still playing the mad old kook who has played before and the story is predictable. To summarize, I was entertained at times, but I was left short of the mystery that the film was suppose to have. However I do have more good news: I would prefer this film over "New Moon" anytime, but I have no intention of spending another 8 bucks on "The Wolfman." I would recommend this film when it is aired on HBO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curse of the American Werewolf of London</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film opens with a color-drained variation of the current Universal logo (why couldn't they have used one of the vintage logos from the 30's or 40's? It would have been so much cooler and more appropriate!) and after some more production logos, segues into a title and voice-over of Maleva (Geraldine Chaplin) reciting a variation on everyone's favorite lycanthropic poem (which is very much tacked on. More on that later.) Cut to Blackmoor England, 1891 where The stage is set for a brutal re-imagining of one of the most tragic horror stories of all time. Long story short: Ben was torn apart, Larry gets bitten by the thing that did it, turns into a beast himself, goes on a few bloody rampages across Blackmoor and London, falls in love with Gwen, defeats his maker in a fiery showdown, and is hunted by an angry mob, ending in classic Universal style, leaving it open for possible sequels.Now time for the actual review: The film is beautifully produced, and photographed by Shelly Johnson with desaturated colors hearkening back to the similar look of Sleepy Hollow rather than the more lush, vibrant palette found in Bram Stoker's Dracula. With the actual production designed by Sleepy Hollow veteran Rick Heinricks, and the screenplay co-written by that film's Andrew Kevin Walker, the general audience will be subconsciously reminded of that last great, Gothic chiller. The Talbot Hall and London sets are grand, and recall the darker corners of the Victorian age without being too stylized, while the slightly fantastical outdoor forest sets directly reminded me of the haunting stage visuals found in the old school Universal back lot. Think the leafless woods from Bride of Frankenstein meets the foggy environs of Llanwelly from the original Wolf Man on a larger, more epic scale.As the title character, Del Toro goes all out. This Wolfman is brutal, scary and doesn't mess around. While not quite the fluffy-headed, neatly dressed icon we all know and love from the original, Rick Baker's masterful make-up is still faithful enough to legendary monster-maker Jack Pierce's classic design (despite making him bulkier and little more wild.) It is truly a testament to Pierce, that a character he designed almost seventy years ago can still be horrifying (with a few tweaks) to modern audiences! Even when the Wolfman was tearing up extras and shredding them up in the goriest ways possible, it was seeing that classic face doing it that nearly brought a tear of joy to this fan's eye! As for the rest of the cast... how can you not like Anthony Hopkins in anything? The man's played Van Helsing, Hannibal Lecter and even Zorro! That being said, nobody plays a kooky, twisted old man like Hopkins, a role he plays here deliciously. If another actor was cast in the role, I don't think the film would have been as good as it turned out. Emily Blunt is attractive and plays the damsel as well as anyone, and Geraldine Chaplin is memorable, despite being grossly underused as Maleva. Of course the third great player in the story is Hugo Weaving as Inspector Aberline. While not as show-stealing as Hopkins, he certainly gives Del Toro a run for his money in the charisma department as the inquisitive detective. I must admit the film sort of fails in the character development department, shifting the original's tragic drama of Man vs. Self, to a more dumbed-down Man vs. Beast (aka Dad) conflict. I do admit, though obvious from the trailers, it was a good twist to spice things up from the original, but I do wish more time was given to flesh out Talbot's inner-suffering ("You don't understand!") Maybe it had enough, but Del Toro just didn't embody it like Chaney. However, the climactic werewolf showdown was a bit much, and while expected from the beginning, it was the only part I found kind of cheesy or silly (especially the Bad Wolf's demise, which is still burned in my mind!) The fight scene reminded me of something out of Planet of the Apes, with the werewolves looking more like two of Disney's Beasts throwing themselves at each other. Another problem I had with the film was the lack of Maleva. While she was prominent in a few scenes, she wasn't given a strong presence throughout like she could have, and it seems like the filmmakers completely forgot about the "Pure in Heart" poem in the film's actual story, so they shamelessly tacked it on the beginning. I also have to confess that Danny Elfman's salvaged score wasn't as memorable as it could have been, often seeming like a riff on Kilar's Dracula soundtrack; but it supported the film's Gothic atmosphere nicely, when it could have been a lot worse. And though the film was filled with digitally altered skies and quick cuts, they were no where nowhere near as distracting or as poorly done as in Stephen Sommers' Mummy franchise.Overall, despite my minor nit-picks, I genuinely loved the film! While it could have been a little better, I am still grateful for what we got, instead of what it could've been. Finally a Universal horror film remade as an actual horror film and not a dumb action/adventure with plenty of comedy and CGI! After three-years in the making, Joe Johnston's The Wolfman is filled with enough atmosphere, drama, suspense, black humor and carnage to stand it proudly on the shelf next to Coppola's Dracula, Brannagh's Frankenstein and Burton's Sleepy Hollow as a successor to its Gothic horror roots. I pray the movie does well, because the efforts of Johnston, the cast and crew and of course Baker's terrific make-up, have finally made the classic monster scary again. Thank you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phenomenal remake of an enjoyable original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While returning home to check on his recently-deceased long-lost brother, a man falls victim to a savage curse passed on by an animal attack and starts to roam the countryside hunting for prey before the authorities can stop him.This was a whole lot of fun and quite easily topping the original in pretty much every way. What this one tends to get right here is the fantastic pace brought along by the tons of action throughout here which is started almost at the beginning of this one. There's plenty to like here with the opening attack on the gypsy camp as the chaos that emerges from the initial warnings and everyone running to safety amid the visually-maimed bodies, the chase to get to it running through out-skirts attacking a few unwary camp-patrons and finally the great stalking in the woods surrounding the camp in a rather chilly encounter that sets this one up nicely. As well, the further encounters here are even better as this one features a slew of exciting action with the night-time sprawl through the forest attacking the hunters out trapping it or stumbling upon the aftermath, the treatment being conducted at the clinic or the recreation of what happened to their mother that's at the start of the whole affair here which all make this very enjoyable and keep the pace going along smoothly. Still, even with all these great scenes there's fantastic action here in two stand-out sequences here, the first of which is the time in the facility where the fun starts with the curative procedure instead triggers the change in front of the staff before ripping through the panicking masses, yet the other part of what works is the glorious rampage through London, scouring over rooftops, crashing through glass windows and overturning traffic in a slew of enthralling action scenes that are high-exciting, action-packed and feature lots of great gore in the numerous kills throughout the section. There's still more fun to be had in the fantastic finale where there's even more to like from the excitingly-staged werewolf brawl here that gets quite exciting in the knock-out brawl-style wrestling that also takes fantastic advantage of their surroundings to get the upper-hand, all the while battling in the middle of the burning room as the fire starts to engulf the rest of the house which adds immensely to the experience as a whole with the big resolution in the fields that are just a ton of fun. What helps all this action along is the glorious Gothic imagery so prevalent throughout this, as the rolling fog, full- moon and period setting in the main house itself that makes this one uber-suspenseful. These here this one good enough to hold off the few minor flaws to be found here. the biggest flaw here is the rather off pacing here with the first half really being taken up with the investigation of the accident and their burgeoning romance brought about by his attack so it tends to meander along in this section until it's time to unleash the beast later on. The other big problem here is the lame CGI here that renders the display of the powers as a little weak and not that scary, but it's a minor quibble. Overall, this was quite the enjoyable effort.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rather Dull &amp; Lifeless Werewolf Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wolfman isn't the worst werewolf movie I've ever seen, but it definitely isn't the best either. It's also pretty slow-paced for the majority of the time, even when it gets into the more frenetic parts, so to actually stay interested in the movie was a bit of a chore. I don't mind slower-paced films as long as the story is good enough to keep my interest, but unfortunately with The Wolfman the story was anything but interesting.The film sees Del Toro playing Lawrence Talbot....an American stage actor who travels to his native England after learning of his brother's death. Determined to find his brother's killer, Talbot conducts his own investigation, but the more he delves into the mystery, the more secrets he uncovers - especially in his own family history.Del Toro, for me at least, does not play the part of a werewolf that well here which is a shame because I think he's a very fine actor. I enjoyed him in movies like Hunted and The Usual Suspects, but here it was really a part suited for someone else. The same goes for Anthony Hopkins...superb actor, but again, he was not suited for this role.If you're looking for a CGI fest of a horror film, then you'll be disappointed because - for the most part - it sticks more to the practical effects &amp; make-up rather than computer effects which were good but Oscar worthy?! I'll leave that for you to decide. On the flip side, though, if you enjoy those style off effects you may be disappointed with the CGI that IS in the movie as it is very obvious and while the CGI is done OK it actually demeans the effort put into the practical effects. A bit of a catch 22 really, but in saying that this is a film that tries to concentrate on story &amp; atmosphere. It's just a pity that it fails on both of these fronts as well.Overall, there's not that much going for this movie and it ends up being a very mediocre horror film that tries to pay homage to the original 1941 film.Not one I'd really recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lawrence Talbot Writ Large.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This follows the old Universal Studios original fairly closely. It doesn't add much to the plot, except more gloom, but -- corn my crackers! -- the effects are gargantuan.It's about what we've come to expect from these remakes of old classics. Everything about it is bigger, carries more impact, costs more money. Poor Lon Chaney, Jr., as the first wolfman, at least started off normally, cheerfully walking the sunny streets of the back lot, paying a pleasant visit to the shops along the way, chatting affably with his father. But Chaney's been eclipsed.Benicio Del Toro doesn't have a happy moment. He's chapfallen and as dark as the images around and behind him. And unlike Lon Chaney, Jr., he looks greasy and always needs a shave. The guy is strapped into a terrible role. He makes Poe's protagonists seem like a vaudeville comedians.Emily Blunt, thanks to the seasonable decision of a gracious Providence, doesn't need a shave. She's all decked out in black -- tight bodice, one of those uncomfortable looking late 19th-century dresses, but she's quite appealing once you get past the clothes. At one point, the camera, echoing Del Toro's rapacious stare, slowly moves in on her plump lips and pale, tender neck. Gee, she looks good. Any normal man would want to leap on her and bite her.Anthony Hopkins, as almost always, bring something unusual to the delivery of his lines. He's a splendid actor and a nice, unpretentious man. "Oh," he remarks to some violence-prone visitors, as if the idea had just occurred to him, "I have two armed men on the roof and they WILL kill you if you don't leave the premises." But I can't really recommend this very highly. It's so damned murky, so black, so threatening, so chiaroscuric, an organoleptic assault. Well -- maybe for the kids. There's enough violence -- really brutal stuff too -- and plenty of action with the wolfman acting like Spiderman, and shootings and the ripping off of heads, leaving bloody stumps, and the ripping off of an arm with a pistol still clutched in the fist and -- Yukkk.Yes, by all means treat your kids. It will hit a particularly resonant chord with any among them who are more than usually hairy.</fullReview>

I would also heavily recommend watching the unrated directors cut of this movie, it goes much deeper into the story and clears up some of the confusion in the theatrical version and also adds some more action packed violence in the middle of the film. I was a skeptic before watching this movie because of some of the reviews but to me this movie deserves much more attention than it got. For me, it's a must watch and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great way to spend some time on a full moon lit night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally! A return to the elements that make up a good old Gothic horror film. This homage to the original Wolfman films wastes no time in getting to the heart of the story, a werewolf has appeared and is killing men. The pompous men of the town are spouting theories, the brother of the man returns to find the killer of his brother, and the resolution of the film leaves us with both a conclusion and another mystery. The cast is superb. Anthony Hopkins creates an intriguing character in Sir John, with the proper amount of tension played between him and Benecio Del Toro, who plays Lawrence. Emily Blunt is striking in her portrayal of the fiancé, Ms. Conliffe, showing the correct Victorian demeanor and just the right levels of emotion. Both Hugo Weaving and Geraldine Chaplin lend an air of mystery and drama in their roles , and the all too brief appearance of Max Von Sydow in the Director's Cut of the film provides the correct level of dynamic mystery to start us off. Collectible of lovers of horror films, and certainly a must see for the older folks who appreciate a well put together film. Rated R appropriately for violence and gore.</fullReview>

Plus all the villagers that chase after him or get killed by him are so stupid it's funny. Anthony Hopkins is a lot of fun to watch.

		<shortDescription>Be'Ware Wolf movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally i got a chance to see this movie. i know it is late for me since the movie has been released 1 and half year earlier. but some negative reviews on IMDb held me back to go for it. But i Got a DVD from a friend and without asking his feedback i came home and started this movie. after 2 hours there was a look of satisfaction on my face. Simply because this movie is so good that it entertained me like Van Helsing &amp; Underworld. One of the greatest movies of this genre. If we leave some technicalities of the movies it is a perfect entertainer for those people who love ware-wolf and vampire stuff. The horror element of the movie is gripping. There are lots of scenes where i almost jumped or shivered due to fear (i usually don't). Though some of you might feel that there is unnecessary gore involved but it goes with the Victorian setting of the story. Plenty of action kept the story's pace alive and suspense kept me at the edge of my seat. Special effect were quite stunning and the transformation scenes are mind blowing. This movie brings you a different version of the ware wolf which we haven't seen in earlier hits. But it works in favor of the movie. I loved everything about the movie. it is a classic piece of cinema. 9/10 would be my rating. I Saw this kind of stuff after a long time and the experience was pleasant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...or the horror! Did not rate this one at all, I'm afraid. The pace was slow, dialogue boring and predictable and the characters were completely under developed.The acting was OK, I suppose, not that the script gave much of an opportunity to shine. Biggest gripe I had with the acting was the accents. Anthony Hopkins couldn't decide whether he was English or Irish and Bernicio Del Toro's native accent kept infiltrating the part American, part English accent that his character should have had. Didn't anyone notice this when they were shooting the movie? I'm no expert on film production but isn't that the sort of thing that might prompt the director to use the word 'cut'? Another gripe was with the Wolfman himself. His face reminded me of Teen Wolf and when he was running on his hind legs with his hands dangling in front of him, he frankly looked a bit camp. Not that I have a problem with gay werewolves but are they scary? I would say no but hey, that's just me.Gore effects were really good (old school decaps are always fun) but not even Rick Baker was enough to save this yawn of a movie.Lame!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of werewolf movies, I honestly had a good feeling that this remake was going to be good. The only thing I read going in was a snippet of Roger Ebert's review regarding the effort of the film-makers in the tribute fashion. What I didn't know was that the film was going to be GREAT!!!!. I watched this with a friend of mine and we were both astounded at this one. Fun to watch and a visual masterpiece. It captures the mood of the time period and as it was shot in merry old England, captures the countryside gloriously.Even though it has mixed reviews in the critical realm and on IMDb and even though it had limited box office returns in the states but good worldwide returns,I predict this movie will have a good debut on DVD and blue ray and will become a grower in the hearts of the people in years to come. Kudos to the treatment by the filmmakers to re-create a classic. JOB WELL DONE!!!!. And to the werewolf fans,my friends and I all loved Dog Soldiers beforehand but this movie is giving it a run for it's money on our personal lists. Can't wait until the next full moon!!! :-)P.S. If you enjoyed "Sleepy hollow" you will like this one, no doubt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Benicio Del tor and Anthony Hopkins star in The Wolfman. I love films like this. Horror movies based on classics. I was a fan of The Mummy remake, Van Helsing if you'd call it one, and Sleepy Hollow. Well, I liked it more than The Mummy and Van Helsing, but I can't quite say that it was better than Sleepy Hollow. The wolfman is a well made film. There is a lot to admire about this film. Such as the film's beautiful setting. The Wolfman has some terrific action sequences and a cheesy one. But here you can forgive them for a cheesy action sequence.The Wolfman kind of aims for cheesiness. When it comes to blood and violence. You could even compare it to The Evil dead but not quite as extreme. There is quite a bit of violence here, but some of it is so extreme it's kind of funny. The Mummy or Van Helsing never really had that much violence. Sleepy Hollow and The wolfman, on the otherhand, do, and that's why they are better.Benicio Del Toro plays Lawrence Talbot, an American who returns to his house in a Victorian era England. Where he finds out that his brother Ben has been murdered. But nobody knows who or what did it. So Lawrence promises Ben's girlfriend Gwen(played by the always likable Emily Blunt)that he will find whatever or whoever killed his brother. Eventually, Lawrence finds out that the thing behind his brother's death is a werewolf. And soon Lawrence is bitten by it. Eventually, while he is a werewolf, Lawrence finds out secrets about his father(played by Anthony Hopkins) and his family. And he is on the run from the police(led by the terrific Hugo Weaving).To some surprise, I loved this film. I loved it's cheesy occasional violence and it's cast and it's awesome action sequences. In some movies like this you can't exactly compliment on the acting. Well, I will compliment everyone here. The film was very well made and written. This is from the writer of Seven, so you can't be too surprised. Forget team Edward or Jacob, go team Wolfman.The wolfman: A</fullReview>

Yes, I know that there were two great actors in lead roles, but both Anthony Hopkins and Benicio Del Toro looked like they were bored. It's not that I would expect, and certainly not want, the same over-the-top melodrama that Branagh used in his Frankenstein, but I didn't really care about either of these two guys. And the big climactic battle? A big CGI bore. I hate to sound so bitter, but if you're going to remake a classic, then put more effort into the acting and the script. Again, the look of the film was great, Hammer Films worthy, but do yourself a favor, watch the original, or the Hammer version for an engaging story, and see this one only for how beautiful it looks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New version based on the classic of the 40s with a top-notch Benicio Del Toro as mythic werewolf</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grisly horror and gore in this formulaic terror film by an excellent duo protagonist , Benicio Del Toro and Anthony Hopkins based on The Wolf Man (1941)by George Waggner and screenplay by Curt Siodmak that is a classic horror about a man who returns home to his father after his brothers death , while staying with his dad and attempting to make amends with him he meets an array of new people and he seems to like it . From creator ¨ Jurassic Park ¨, ¨Jumanji¨ and recently ¨Captain America¨ bring us this ¨Wolfman¨, a creepy terror movie that have you breathless . Upon the death of his brother , Larry Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) returns from his stage acting to his ancestral home . He's now the heir to the family estate after the death of his elder brother . His father , Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins) , welcomes him back warmly and he soon settles into local life and takes an interest in the brother's girlfriend named Gwen(Emily Blunt). Fables and myths abound about werewolves, beasts that are half-man and half-wolf. For Larry, those myths may be all too real. He visits a gypsy camp when are attacked by someone who has turned into a werewolf . Larry fights the werewolf but things take a turn for the worst when is bitten during the fight. Larry's father tells him that this will cause him to become a werewolf at each full moon . Larry confesses his plight to his unbelieving father , Sir John, then the villagers join in a hunt for the wolf . Larry, transformed by the full moon, heads for the forest and a fateful meeting with the villagers . Later Larry is developing an extraordinary force and aware himself there happened more than an accident and has a horrible curse who cannot to control . Then he undergoes a dental and hirsute transformation at the night and going on a murderous rampage every time the moon is full. He increases strength , heightened senses and unnatural sexual allure and he sprout hair and pointy ears , his hands have a five-pointed star like a pentagram , but it's the mark of the beast and pretty freaks occur them . He's been infected, he's cursed , he's got to sever the line of the beast . Larry bears the marking of the beast , the only way to break the curse is to find the werewolf that attack him . The problem is how to kill the werewolf , with silver bullet but also has to separate the head from the heart .This exciting motion picture displays drama , action, suspense, terror with mysterious touches and is quite entertaining . It's a crossover with a little of the classic version ¨Lon Chaney's Werewolf¨, and ¨John Landis' Werewolf in London¨ and wrapped in a postmodern style . It's some different but with clear reference to previous vintage film . Good performances from Benficio Del Toro as a good man when is bitten by a werewolf and becomes one himself and the veteran Anthony Hopkins who hides a terrible secret . The transformation of man into werewolf is complex and is made by expert make-up artist Rick Baker , creator in ¨ Lobo , Men in black , Grinch , Gorillas in the mist ¨ and many others ; furthermore by means of computer generator FX, and a device under remote control ,thus the radio-control moves the eyes,ears, nose, lips werewolf ,besides an actor into the suit brings the life the creepy Wolf man. The famous screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker provides a well-knit plot with mystery and horror, giving full rein to Joe Johnston natural talent for the terror genre . Stirring and thrilling musical score by Danny Elffman , Tim Burton's usual . Colorful and dark cinematography by Shelly Johnson , Joe Johnston's ordinary . It's a standard terror and sometimes graphically gory and turns out to be an acceptable attempt to cash in the werewolf sub-genre. Rating : 6,5 Good .</fullReview>

I understood everything from the first five minutes so the rest of the was a waste.And there is antidote. Give the person that is the wolf man an implant of silver into their body. This way he would not be able to morph into the wolf man, the silver would react. And it wouldn't kill him. So if they create another one they will be able to use my idea on how to stop him morphing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, I am a big fan of the original Wolfman starring Lon Chaney Jr. Honestly, there has been any other movie that I have hyped for in my entire life. The trailers already made it look dark, but would it live up to my expectations? I found that out right when the film started. The pace of the film is perfect and I love that dark tone of the film. Benicio Del Toro plays an excellent Larry Talbot, a good guy at the wrong place at the wrong time. Anthony Hopkins plays a great Sir John Talbot, but more of a cynical nature. Emily Blunt and Hugo Weaving turn in spectacular performances. The film was much darker than I expected. If you are very weak stomach or bad heart, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM. The overall story works and doesn't seem too unoriginal. If you are a fan of the Universal Monster Legacy, see this film. This is a very scary film, and this ain't your daddy's Wolfman. There is a lot of great scenes, sequences, and quotes. The film is really a great piece of what can truly happen, when a remake, actually turns out to be good. How it compares to a 69 year old film that's for you to decide.</fullReview>

I had fun watching the movie and will see it again when it comes out on DVD. This made for a great Valentine's Day date with my hubby, who normally will not watch scary movies. He does not enjoy gratuitous violence either, but he does love really good special effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite simply this was one of the worst films I've seen in a long time which I find very disappointing. What baffled me most was how bad this movie was considering the acting talent involved (Benico, Blunt, Hopkins, Weaving). Del Toro's heart didn't seem it and it showed a lot. Hopkins was plain dreadful. Blunt's character was severely underdeveloped and Weaving was forgettable. Overall it was a horribly disjointed, shallow, hollow and dull. Nonetheless I kept waiting for it to get better but it never did. The cinema I was in (which was quite full) got restless fast with is meandering plot. You would think a movie about werewolves would be at the very least entertaining but I cannot even say that about this film. What annoyed me about this film was the potential of the story with its Gothic overtones and setting. Instead it almost bored me to tears. 1/10. Don't even bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wolfman. It is a story steeped in history and mythology originating through various sources throughout Ancient and Medieval era in Europe. The idea of a werewolf is a creative manifestation of man's fears in the "unknown beasts" that live in the wild. The idea of random attacks committed by wildlife in which man has no control over is a frightening concept. Though if one were to be able to assign blame to an individual then any said attacks would be easier to fathom as a man can be controlled.In this reinterpretation of the classic Universal film "The Wolfman", the title character is played by Benicio del Toro. His character's name is Lawrence Talbot and he is called home to Talbot Hall in the wake of his brother's murder. We are introduced to characters such as Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins), Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt) and Inspector Aberline (Hugo Weaving). This tale incorporates classic themes such as the ties that a person keeps with their "home", how childhood trauma affects a person throughout their life and the unresolved emotional deficiencies between father and son.It is the latter theme that is most prevalent in this film. Within a modern culture males are discouraged from expressing themselves emotionally in any manner other than through anger. Which is all well and good in a wartime situation or in getting things done necessary to a person's way of life. Though it has it's purpose this type of acceptable emotional expression has profound effects on a person's mind. It has the potential to disrupt and cause ripples through a person's life and in the case of this film; it drives a wedge between father and son. Lawrence Talbot goes to the United States of America and becomes an actor. While becoming an actor he is able to mask childhood trauma by learning how to become other people, he is also able to learn how to emotionally express himself. This runs counter to Sir John Talbot who expresses nothing but anger, resentment and frustration. Lawrence is even called weak by his father for showing emotion.This message is not exclusive to film. This a dynamic that exists in all communities, regions and faiths. It affects all who come into contact and the only way to work through it is to embrace the whole of a person. This includes what is described as masculine, feminine and everything in between. After all one whole is always better than one part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way better than its troubled production would suggest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Universal President Ron Meyer has called The Wolfman one of the worst films the studio ever put out, which seems a bit harsh - possibly one of the most disappointing for them considering the amount of money they foolishly kept pouring into production and the amount of interference they caused. With the endless reshoots and retooling this film had, it seemed like every executive took a crack at it and the Universal janitorial staff probably had more creative control than Joe Johnston. Studio meddling aside, The Wolfman plays surprisingly well. The makeup effects are top notch, the period design is stylish and beautifully theatrical and while it's not scary for a moment, it's playfully gory. The CG is uneven, with digital backgrounds and digital wolf effects occasionally unconvincing. Benicio del Toro gives a passable, understated performance, Anthony Hopkins hams things up as usual and Emily Blunt is a bore to watch. The film's romantic angle with Blunt is forced and she and del Toro have no chemistry. With all its troubled production and post production, this is hardly a disaster and while not an outright success, The Wolfman is a worthy remake of a classic monster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Wolfman" is a thriller movie which has to do with a man who after some years returns to his mother land because his brother had been murdered and now he wants to find his murderer and take revenge for his brother. Also in this movie we have a curse by werewolf and this is the main theme of this movie, and how this affect the lives of these people.I liked this movie because of the plot, the storyline and the picturing of the whole movie. I also liked the interpretation of Benicio Del Toro who plays as Lawrence Talbot and simply was outstanding. Another good interpretation made by Anthony Hopkins who plays as Sir John Talbot the father of Lawrence Talbot.Finally I have to tell you that "The Wolfman" is a really good and worth seeing movie. I also think that you will love this movie even of you are not a fan of thriller movies because this movie combines really well mystery and drama with thriller and suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, well crafted remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually, modern Hollywood remakes of classic films are the fast food version, dumbed down to appeal to the lowest common denominator with a lack of care or substance by its creators. That fortunately is not the case here with this epic, big budget Gothic horror production. I must admit I was not crazy about Benicio Del Toro in some other stuff I had seen him in, but he really won me over with his performance in this. Keeping up with Anthony Hopkins is no easy task, so I must give credit where it is due. In a lot of ways this is a throwback to the classic Gothic horror style, but crafted in a modern way. While there are digital f/x and cgi, there are top notch make up f/x by Rick Baker of An American Werewolf In London fame. As well as impressive stuntwork and sets. The film looks great with excellent cinematography as well. The acting and direction is solid with the cast and director bring this Victorian era of England period piece to life. While this is a classy, Gothic horror with atmosphere, psychology and drama. There is enough blood, gore and brutal violence to keep modern horror fans happy as well. The score is very similar to Francis Ford Coppla's Dracula, but it works so why complain? Overall , director Joe Johnston did a nice job with this film. Initially, The Wolfman did'nt do well at the box office , but I'm sure is picking up new fans (me included) as more people get a chance to check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) has come back home to attend his brother Ben's funeral. Ben was the latest to be viciously attacked. Suspicions abound including the local gypsies, mad men, and even myths. Ben's fiancée Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt), the father (Anthony Hopkins), and the manservant Singh (Art Malik) all live in the Gothic country estate. One night, the werewolf attacks the Gypsies camp and Lawrence is bitten. After this, Scotland Yard Inspector Aberline (Hugo Weaving) comes to investigate.Director Joe Johnston is trying for dark and moody. Instead, he's achieved cold and tired. Benicio Del Toro isn't a particularly sympathetic or appealing lead. The audience knows that it's a werewolf. It doesn't really matter who's the werewolf. As a mystery, there isn't much compelling. As a horror movie, this is not scary. Other than the visual look, there isn't any interesting going on here. There isn't anything new or exciting. It's going over old territories with a few new CGI tricks. At least Tony had some fun over acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wolfman was such an utter disappointment. Very slow, plodding story and clinical CGI effects. Benicio del Toro is totally miscast as the protagonist. He's too old, to fat and totally unconvincing in his ethnic role (a Puerto Rican Brit?). The major cast members,del Toro, Hopkins and Blunt are all phoning in their performances for a quick paycheck. The characters have less depth than cardboard cutouts and the second-rate sfx can't carry the movie. And exactly what is Hopkins' characters motivation for doing evil. Is he just a BAAAAAAAAAD man of just CAH-RAAAAZY from being a werewolf? The main failure of the flick, however is its total lack of any real fearful or suspenseful moments as well as any characters I could really empathize with. Del Toro's werewolf scenes did have me howling with unintentional laughter at times, though. Absolutely pathetic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horror is mystery, mystery is horror. This is one of the most essential truths that film makers need to realize. We fear what we don't understand, we fear the unknown. So is it really too much to ask for a horror film that manages to maintain it suspension beyond the first five minutes? According to this film, yes, it apparently is too much to ask. Here is a film that tries to be suspenseful, that tries to build up the drama, that tries to focus on the mood and the characters. It's just so utterly bad at it. Nothing is original, nothing is inventive, nothing comes as a great shock - or even as a shock.And yes, sometimes horror movie can work because of the splatter and the creepy imagery, and this movie has some of that. The werewolves look a bit silly from time to time, but occasionally they will look really cool, so it's a mixed package in that regard. The settings are also kind of nice and the action has some oomph behind it. The problem is that the film tries to be a suspense film, a mystery film. But that mystery kind of fails to even begin building up when the werewolf walks into the frame for the first time in his/her human form and you can immediately tell that (s)he's the werewolf. And there goes the suspense... After that it's just a prolonged borefest where the characters talk, experience flashbacks, try to be emotional, have awkward "romances" and then get brutally slaughtered. Did I mention that the splatter isn't half bad? The biggest problem in my opinion are the actors. Anthony Hopkins is still somewhat good, mainly because he's Anthony Hopkins, but even he's rather miserable compared to his usual performances. And the rest are just awful. No chemistry, no emotions, no dedication, just lines read with monotonous tones. No flair, no elegance, no craftsmanship. It's like these people have never acted in their life.Still, I've seen worse. If bad horror movies are your thing, there is something for you here. It's not a deep film, but it should sate your bloodlust for the evening. But if you're just about anyone else, keep looking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wolfman is either meant to be a horror film or an action film but it lacks the critical ingredients of either.As a horror film a lacks all suspense. There is no terrifying build up, just violence that turns up exactly where you expect it. A good horror film makes you think something is about to happen when it doesn't and just when you think things are safe it does. This film doesn't even try. On the one occasion in the film where it comes out of nowhere it has little impact because you barely see anything and it happens to a random extra you don't care about.If you were to classify it as a horror film it would only be because it is extremely gory. However even gore needs to be done in a way that it has psychological impact. The gore in this film is displayed so casually it has no impact. It is like the impact of nudity at a nudist colony as opposed to a striptease.As an action film it is very short on actual action. There are essentially three bits of action: a teaser at the start, a bit in the middle and the climax. In between there are long portions of back-story and filler that are plain uninteresting. They may have served a purpose if they helped you sympathise with the characters but they were basically just exposition. As I said before the main problem is there is no suspense to any of it. Apart from the sheer poor timing of it there are few characters you can care about, or if you could care about them they aren't in peril.The weird thing is none of the actual performances are bad. The special effects are okay, but not particularly original. I didn't like the character design of the werewolves much though, they kind of remind me of Wookies. The dialogue, looked at in isolation, isn't all that bad either. Is is just a poorly constructed film that commits the sin of being flat out boring. At least if the acting had been bad it could have been unintentionally funny. Unfortunately it can't even claim to be so bad it's good. It is just bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like horror movies, but this film was a big disappointment. You would think a director couldn't go wrong with at least being entertaining with a story about a guy turning into a werewolf, but in this movie, it did go wrong. The usually enjoyable Del Toro is boring in this. He plays, Lawerence, whom has just returned to his home land and learns that his brother is missing. They find the brother's body and he has a look of horror in death. So, Lawerence is out to find the monster that killed him. There are rumors about gypsies so he starts there and there is a run with the monster at gypsy camp. Lawerence is bitten, so he turns into a werewolf also. And there is some silly side plot with his brother's widow that didn't even make sense. Lawerence is taken to a psych ward and studied by this guy that thinks it's all in Lawerence's mind. But of course, Lawerence transforms and the guy meets his end.The ending doesn't even make much sense. I involves Lawerence's father, and I think you can probably guess the rest.FINAL VERDICT: a waste of time</fullReview>

Now let's take a legendary script again and mess with the story line a bit and come up with The Wolfman, and let's not stop there, let's get legendary great Sir Anthony Hopkins in the movie. Check, Check, Great! The guy from the matrix. Check, Check, Great! Emily Blunt. Check, Check, Great! And have a ton more cash available, the latest technology at our disposal, top notch wardrobe, sound, score, etc. Check, Check, Great! And make a tremendous movie?NOT! No check, check, great! No check, great. No great. Just poop. The story helps, although you're immediately shoving the sob story dead fiancé down our throats. Let's just leave that at "it doesn't work here." You're shoving that Lawrence plays roles such as Hamlet. Let's just leave that at "it doesn't work." No, sorry, let's not? it's the whole spine of the movie. Sir Anthony Hopkins could have played Hamlet, that we would believe, and maybe he banged the immigrant costume design lady when he was doing a stage tour 45 years ago and baby Lawrence grew up in a shack somewhere and ventured out to find his dad later on in life after being a stowaway on a ship or a lower level blue collar guy of sorts who made his way to go visit or find his dad. Really sorry, but calling the character 'Lawrence' and showing him in a montage of paper clippings that he's a 'Shakespearean' trained actor and having the inspector compliment him on his brilliant past acting only sets him up for a fall throughout the movie. Loved the line when the father says to Lawrence such as, 'you know you're not the only actor in the family.' The audience in the theater chuckled at that one. It was a release to what everyone was thinking. The inspector, the father, the surprisingly out of nowhere girlfriend, why even the locals down at the tavern worked out okay, but Lawrence, oh my, you've done terrible, terrible things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit that I was sadly disappointed with this production. I was certain with an All-Star cast that it would be worthy of a 6 or more rating. Sadly I was being generous with the 4 of 10 stars mainly due to the elite cast. First off they could've dropped one of the "All-Stars" and spent a dime or two on effects. The wolves in the film were about as realistic as they were in the original. Secondly the wolves would kill at will with swift precision that could not be defended...unless it was of course the Inspector or the only "hot chick" in the flick...at this point there appeared to be a lack of speed, killer instinct and the swift razor claws. Thirdly...gosh...as much as I like flicks that encourage an imaginative mind...it just wasn't good...from any aspect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Big expectations. Liked all the set design. The fog ridden streets of London were cool. The clothing worked just right. It looked great. I know it's about the full moon, but they could have worked out the full moons more clever in their presentation and maybe even dropped one or two of them as transition shots. Because there were so many full moons, it made it that when it counted to have a full moon it wasn't as powerful, as in sometimes a little less is better. This isn't the problem. The problem is in the casting. Not the little supporting roles, but in the big one. Let me take that back, there was a very bad choice in the hair and make-up or directing chair with one. The mean psychiatrist was delivered to us as if he was Lawrence's doctor when Lawrence was a kid, which I would say was like 35 years ago, because this guy is all of 45 years old and he was ten or twelve at most when he was last in the asylum. So flash forward 35 years and the doctor who must have been at least 35 years old now would be 70. Okay, let's give it the benefit of the doubt and say that Lawrence is only 35 himself now, yeah right, but okay let's say that Lawrence is 35 and it was only 25 years ago, so the doctor is 60 now. Okay let's get crazy and say the doctor is only 55 years old now, and that is pushing it. How in heck is it possible for this guy, the psychiatrist, not to have a gray hair on his head or beard? It's pitch black. A 125 years ago they looked old a lot younger, if that makes any sense, and I don't think 'just for men' hair dye was overly popular or in fashion. It is so obvious this guy's hair is dyed. To show that time has passed alone and that he was his doctor from when he was a kid they should have grayed him up to show some sort of passage of time for that reason alone. Just so we feel like this was his doctor back in the day. I know, very small detail. But really, what's the budget on this script, ten million, twenty million? Something like this gets by. The make up person or actor himself doesn't bring this up. Didn't they read the script? This is minor and it's a far cry from the real mistake of the movie?.the lead...why was he the lead? I guess the director and lead actor didn't read the script either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I didn't buy into the story, and how can you mess that up? It's simple?guy gets bit on the neck by a werewolf and becomes the wolfman. It's been done and it works like a charm. Fast forward a bunch of decades from 1941 to 2010 and you change some stuff to make it better...or in this case, worse. If something isn't broken don't fix it, and if you do, make it better, not worse. But what they did was more monstrous than the monster. Such as the movie starts off with the fiancée being in mourning after her lover's death. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Sorry, but seriously, she's in mourning, the body of her fiancée is still in the serve chilled section of the animal barn and she's on to falling in love with the newly arrived brother. So her character is knocked out of line immediately. Not much pity given to her, audience around us were making funny comments like 'whore,' 'gold-digger,' and so on. Problem is she is a great actress and she did a good job with the lines she had to read, but great acting can only take it so far, the story has to work. Now I'm not a movie writer but how's this for a couple of quick fixes. Why even have the brother story line in there and the fiancée back story altogether. Couldn't she just be someone that the guy from America meets when he arrives at his father's house? Maybe she meets him at the tavern or goes to the father's house to sell him antiques or works on the father's estate and takes care of the father or something. Anything. Please anything. And the lead guy, my wife and I have a couple of friends that do theater. To the point, every single one of them is leaps and bounds more refined than the lead guy in this movie. They talk about him like he's Laurence of Olivia and that he's a stage legend of sorts. Even the inspector knows of his performances. The little flashback of the lead guy on stage holding the head was almost comical as if some local guy came in off the street and was acting like he was an actor as a joke in front of his friends from the local tavern. They want this guy to play the wolfman, no problem. Let him be an American, who never stepped foot in England and NOT a stage actor at all. It's simple enough, have him be the bastard child of the world traveled father who slummed it with a local whore or something, and the son who was born in these lower class slums of somewhere where they no speak good English. It would have saved a lot of embarrassment and not have taken everyone out of the movie every time there wasn't action and the guy spoke with his American accent. It would have fit perfect, the father even says at the end that the wolfman curse was his son's legacy. So why not have this poor guy from the streets of America get a telegram how his ailing father has requested his presence or something that works and makes sense for the character? I know several people who were born in England and Ireland and only lived there ten or twelve years and they still have a bit of an accent. Now take this with a guy who is master of Shakespearean theater. Well, you'd get something a lot more than this guy delivered. He walked around like he never wore shoes before. Am I being critical? Yes, this guy wasn't a one liner who was the money guy's cousin, or was he? Give him a lead he can handle or at least change the back story so it fits him, or get him an acting coach who tells him he doesn't quite have it down yet. This guy was Acting every time he had to be posh. It was very unnatural.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The remake of The Wolfman just didn't do it for me. The story line stunk so bad you could smell it. But I will admit the make up and effects were amazing. Rick Baker did an excellent job as usual. I did like how several parts in the movie reminded me of the original and An American Werewolf In London and even Curse Of The Werewolf. If you are a huge fan of the original by all means watch the remake and see for yourself. It was very predictable and lacked scope. I did however enjoy the scene where Lawrence transformed in the insane asylum. That was a very good scene that reminded me of Curse Of The Werewolf. However I did not like the fact that Lawrence and his father duke it out in the end. That is one thing that has been done to death in films and it is getting old. Give me a break for crying out loud! This is supposed to be a classic monster movie not Van Helsing. Had they stuck with the original story line they would have been better off. Another thing that ticked me off was how Maleva the gypsy was not a key character in the film like she was in the original. Del Toro on the other hand did okay was Lawrence. They took his character in a totally different way. This film should have been handled with much more delicate hands. By all means the original is the best and always will be. The fact that they butchered the story line really upsets me, because the original is a classic jewel of a movie and should be handled with great care. It's not to be handled with kid gloves. It upsets me that this movie could have been a blockbuster hit had they just stayed true to the original film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll start off with the disclaimer that I have not seen the original 1941 version. And a little about myself to give perspective: I'm 35, male, and I've seen and enjoyed (at least on some level) most of the major "monster" genre films of the past 20+ years. This is, in my opinion, undoubtedly one of the worst of the genre in a quite a while. And easily the worst movie I've seen this year.The acting was flat, emotionless. I can only imagine this to be intentional, as this judgment would apply to all the main characters. I honestly felt nothing for any of these characters. Even when the romantic storyline is revealed, it feels forced, pointless, awkward. Dialogue is sparse-- again presumably intentional-- but fails to make up for its rarity with any real meaning or wit. Is there a reason why Lawrence begins the film portraying an emotionless Hamlet-- unable to mourn his lost Yorick-- other than to draw attention to the fact that we have here an compelling actor (del Toro) playing a painfully flat character? But my real complaint is that the movie is packed with dramatic red herrings-- story arcs, events, characters, etc-- that lead absolutely NOWHERE. Why the gypsy suggestion that love can end the curse? Why the romantic thread? How does the inspector-- in ANY way-- propel the story, other than occasionally shooting bullets into objects adjacent to the title character? Is there any reason there are gypsies in the movie, other than to endorse a tired cliché? And on a smaller level, there's lots of nonsense: why do the physicians in the asylum wait for the title character to fully transform into a werewolf before attempting to flee? Why the elaborate winch mechanism to submerge Lawrence in ice-water? Why would anyone send someone into a Himalayan cave to turn into a werewolf so that they would come back and kill everyone? Why? Why? Why? Even when you know how a story will end, it can still be fun watching it arrive at that foreseen destination. But only if the story is compelling, the acting at least adequate, the dialogue inspired. Not the case here.To be fair, I'll add that the settings were beautifully depicted, and the special effects were pretty good (though the wolves walking on walls at the end was kinda silly).Please, Hollywood...try harder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The WolfmanDue to its close association with the lunar cycle and its ability to cause its victims to enter in to a blind rage, lycanthrope may just be the male equivalent to the female menstrual period. However, you'll need a lot more than a Kotex lined net to capture the crimson soaked beast in this hairy horror movie.Subsequent to his brother's mysterious disappearance, Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) is requested by his brother's wife (Emily Blunt) to return to the family estate and help his estranged father (Anthony Hopkins) with the manhunt. Meanwhile, a detective (Hugo Weaving) leads a search party to track down a beast that's been stalking the countryside. But before the creature can be subdued, it bites Lawrence, who must then endure a painful transformation every full moon.A re-make of the 1941 Universal Studios classic, this updated version borrows heavily from the mythos but also forges its own Gothic and violent interpretation. Unfortunately, the budding romance between Lawrence and his sister-in-law is never fully fleshed out.And while capturing a werewolf would certainly be cause for celebration, it's important to note that when hunting for The Wolfman to avoid capturing a Grecian male sunbather by accident.

		<shortDescription>This wolfman only 'looks' scary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The WolfmanEven a man who is pure of heart and says his prayers by night may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright. The Wolfman 2010 is a remake of the 1941 classic horror film of the same name. Benicio Del Toro plays a Shakespearean theatre artist by the name of Lawrence Talbot. One day he is told of his brother's disappearance by his fiancé Gwen Conliffe(Emily Blunt). At first refusing that news to bother him, he eventually pays his home a visit, where he hasn't been to in a long time. There he meets his estranged father Sir John(Anthony Hopkins). He meets up with his fathers man servant Singh(Art Malik) who tells him of weird tidings. He is reminded of his past in which his mother died when he was just a kid. He starts getting visions of when he saw his mothers body in his fathers lap. She had apparently committed suicide. He is then told that his brother's body has been found. He decides to go to the slaughterhouse to check the body out and is horrified to look at the condition the body is in. He collects his brothers personal belongings and goes away. After overhearing some conversations in the local bar he learns that the people believe that there is some strange creature around town which killed his brother Ben, or maybe the gypsies did it because Ben died a day after the gypsies came to town. He then ventures into the jungle to meet with the gypsies and gather whatever information he could. And co-incidentally that was a full night, and when people were on the verge of arresting a gypsy bear, who they thought was responsible for the killings, the actual creature attacks the gypsy set-up. A gypsy boy ventures into the dark and Lawrence Talbot decides to follow him to save him but in the process is confronted by the creature who bites him but Lawrence is saved by the armed townsfolk. But he is saved by the gypsy witch Maleva(Geraldine Chapline).Then begins the adventure. Like every werewolf movie, its set up in an old shanty English town, most of the scenes are shot in the dark, basically this film gives you the whole feel of a werewolf movie and it does good. How during every full moon night, there's fog, and how Lawrence turns into a werewolf and goes around town killing people. And obviously in the process he and his brother Ben's fiancé Gwen fall in love, and in turn she is the only one who can save him from this wretched curse. And during all this comes Inspector Aberline(Hugo Weaving), who is out there to find out who is behind all these killings. What his movie lacks is the thrill and the edge of the seat action. This movie takes you through a nice ride which completely feels like a dark and creepy werewolf movie but is not in actuality, it just feels that way. There are hardly any thrills except for the loud wolf howls which look and sound pretty awesome. The effects are pretty decent but nothing to crave about. The acting is what it is expected to be but Benicio Del Toro has yet again proved that he can still act. Art Malik as Singh at times looks quite intense with his hair open while cleaning the guns of the house. By the time the film reaches the climax you get kind of bored but not sleepy. Its mostly predictable like any other werewolf/creature film but quite watch-able. Go watch the film and night and you'll come out moderately creeped out! Aaaaaooooooooooo!!!5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complex characters suffer from lack of development</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, this could have been so great. I'm even the type of horror fan that loves cheese so I feel like I put up with a lot. But it just fell flat. My biggest complaint: no character development. The dialogue almost seemed to be sliced down. Maybe not, maybe it was written that way. Anthony Hopkins and Benecio Del Toro are great, but they seem to have nothing to work with. Both characters are complex but the dialogue is so sparse we never get to really appreciate either. Too bad. Both actors were good picks. Other things in the movie that drove me nuts. What was up with that music? Danny Elfman is my favorite composer of movie scores but I can't stand when the music tells you how to feel. It was way over the top without any subtleness when subtleness would have worked best. Why didn't the Talbots have British accents? I mean I can suspend reality but there was even a scene where I heard a tinge of Puerto Riccan accent in Del Toro. The other actors had British accents. And let's face it folks, we know Del Toro and Hopkins can do British accents! Which that is a minor complaint. I know I could have forgiven that if it weren't for everything else. So why the 4 stars? Hey the actual wolfman and the mayhem were cool to me in its cheesiness. It was a lot of fun. Those to me seemed to be the best scenes. It may have worked better if they had played on the cheese a little or even added just a tinge of tongue and cheek humor, not taking itself so seriously. Come on, a giant wolf human howling at the moon: that is just asking for a little bit of humor somewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>overall: a failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It had potential, had great cast, great sets, effects, all that stuff was perfect. But from a moment on it starts to grow dull and it stays that way to the end of the movie. An underdeveloped story, it furnishes you the essentials, as if it would tell you: 'got the idea, right? OK, then let's just skip the details'. It was as if they were in a hurry to just finish the movie and go somewhere else where they had more important business to attend to. It is too bad, it could have been a good movie through all this rain of extremely bad movies of the last period. Maybe because they tried to much to stick to the original film made in 1941, which was really fun with no claims ? good cheap horror. But this remake has a huge source of talent which it doesn't challenge at all. Some good words for actors ? they all try. Broody, enigmatic and magnetic ? whatever they are, they can't float the movie because there was almost no heartbeat in any of their characters. A story told in a haste. From a certain moment on, it really becomes extremely predictable and boring, hard to watch all the way to the end. Overall, not a god movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whats better than 1 werewolf? Suicide.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you haven't seen the original, and I think most can say they haven't, than your going to love this film. You're going to love it because it has all the ear marks of the Hollywood trife that we've been supporting since Terminator 2 destroyed cinema. Before you get mad at me about T2, Im not saying that its a bad movie, Im saying that when T2 came out it destroyed peoples ability to make visually sub-par movies. The standard was than set so high that a viewer simply can't watch an old film of substance anymore.No wonder than that "Wolfman" is such an epic disaster. Im not hating on it for its decent content, Im not upset with it for its decent script. Im not mad at it for its fun and moody back drops that are an ode to the original. Im not even upset that Sir Anthony Hopkins character was clearly a schizophrenic. What upsets me is that the movie could have been so good that it could have deserved a 9 out of 10 had they just cut the climax of the movie.Now I know right now your thinking "Cut the climax? Whats sex without orgasm? Whats cake without frosting?" but the problem with this movie is that it makes you expect a great climax. Like that girl in highschool that would always flirt with you but would never let you take her out, it strings you along thinking your getting somewhere and then BOOM let down city.Here's how the film was made:The writer watches the original a billion times. He than writes a great script. He submits that script to the executive producers who than call him into the office for a meeting. Than it goes like this:Executive #1: "hey that's a great script you wrote! We love it! We really want to make this movie... but we were thinking about how to make it better."Writer: "You love it, but it needs to be better?"Executive #2: "Ya we were thinking; Whats better than 1 werewolf?"Writer: "What?"Executive #1: "2 werewolves!"Executive #2: "and ONE of them is ON FIRE!"Writer: "omg..can I at least keep my ending?"Executive #1: "yes but only if we can leave it open for a sequel"Subsequently the writer committed suicide after he saw the first cut and thats why it only gets a 5. Lesson to be learned: don't ruin beauty with 5 minuets of with an over-done firey werewolf slugfest when you could just leave it how it is.Final thoughts: Watch than edit out the 5 minutes of crap, than watch again, enjoy a coke and a smile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Largely disappointing and predictable. Rent it rather than buy it, and only if you're bored</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie began with so much potential that it was almost tedious to watch the way it ended. There were gypsies, and a strange man with a silver staff, but these ended up being little but interesting filler. The plot, despite its potential for a fabulous twist or the feeling of wondrous jig-saw puzzle coming together, ended up being predictable to the point where it was difficult to feel much emotion for any of the actors.The all-star cast was another let down. Benicio del Toro, who often delivers unique performances (such as those in Sin City and Things We Lost in the Fire) portrayed a character who was burnt-out and angry at his family, but ultimately difficult to connect with due to his somewhat morose. Emily Blunt, another wonderful actor who wowed audiences in The Young Victoria, plays a young woman with the typical 'Protagonist's Girlfriend' attitude, much similar to that of Louis Lane or Mary Jane Watson. In other words, she is the Damsel in Distress who will, and does, do everything she can to save the one she loves. Snore. Anthony Hopkins, of the Silence of the Lambs and Bram Stoker's Dracula fame, also ends up playing the sinister father with a dark secret that most people who take one look at the character can work out. It must be said, though, that this apparent lack of wow factor from the actors has much to do with the terrible script and movie pacing they had to follow.The movie does have some positive aspects. The setting is superb, as are the costumes and soundtrack. The atmosphere of gloom and suspense is well-held and there are some very creative camera shots. Lovers of gore will enjoy this, as will lovers of old-school horror movies that use the same formulas as most other horror movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was very disappointed....*some possible spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like most of my generation have grown up with the classics w/ Lon Chaney(Jr.) and I appreciate them for what they are. However if the idea is to remake one then it should be done in today's fashion. This movie may have all the glitz and glamor of a blockbuster these days but it fails in SO many other areas.1) Benicio Del Toro sucks as a 19th century citizen, he should stick to his tried and true stereotypes in the 21st century. His acting was very bad in my opinion and I was surprised at this.2) The 'Wolfman' is supposed to be a Werewolf who is half man half wolf, as so many other stories and movies have depicted. In the time of the original it was acceptable for it to be a man in a wig, mask and such; However with todays technology(and I don't necessarily mean CGI) the Werewolf should have looked more like a wolf within a man's body. So the Werewolf in this movie looks like he did in the 40's but with better makeup, that to me was a big mistake. I'm not saying that they should have deviated from the original in story, pay homage and such, but visually this was like seeing the original via CGI...was that even necessary? 3) The story was not poorly perceived, it lacked some continuity and had very little integrity. There are far too many instances to list. Some examples of the under developed story are; why does the father wish to kill his children? because they are cursed? he admits to embracing it. Moving on, why would the fiancé (woman) of a man, whom's death she is researching, fall in love with his own brother? Next, Why do bullets seem to have no effect at all on the Wolfman? (I understand they need to be silver to kill him, but any should slow him down) Well that's my rant on this one, it's a huge disappointment in my book, you watch it at your own risk and see what you think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few month ago we wanted to see this movie in the cinema, but somehow this movie was canceled by the cinema and we had to go to another movie (Sherlock Holmes, great movie btw!). So we rented this movie, but we where glad we did not see this movie in the cinema.My wife and i did not like the story. It is a very simple story and does not have a twist to make it somewhat more interesting. We used the fastforward button a lot, so that's not good. A really waist of our time, although the camera work is very nice, and the settings was done very good.I am still hoping for better story lines in movies.. somehow it's not getting any better these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How could you fail with a lineup like that?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If a stunning lineup, next-generation special effects and atmospheric sets and cinematography are enough to make a movie, then one would have thought The Wolfman couldn't fail. However in the real world of successful cinema, a screenplay which is both engaging and compelling is also required to make the mix flavoursome. Unfortunately, what this movie has in its components, it also lacks in content. The last minute addition of director Joe Johnston seemed like an attempt to rescue a film from a creatively frustrated Mark Romanek, however it is now apparent the movie was already too far down its badly written path of choice. Del Toro's moody anti-hero and Hopkin's Mysterious father-figure unfortunately clash in a very two-dimensional way leaving an empty taste and an unfitting opinion of two master-class actors. Entering the cinema with expectations of a collaboration of horror, CGI and great performances, I left dissatisfied. The stunning visuals make this entirely enjoyable, but its lack of substance produces a saddening level of disappointment. When embarking on a remake, one must consider that although the tale is classic, your audience is new and endowed with a much higher expectation with their modern film- making. The unfortunate predictability of this story creates a frustration not common with the likes of Hopkins and Del Toro. The fantastic transformation sequences were a show of Johnston's artistic and creative ability, and the beautiful sets and cinematography of Chatsworth House make for visual satisfaction but at no point are you scared, surprised or seduced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent retelling of a classic using modern tech</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joe Johnston is usually a basic-stock director who does not stretch himself with unbelievable gags like Stephen Sommers did with two Mummy films and one Van Helsing film. The Werewolves in this film bear absolutely no resemblance to Sommers rendition in Van Helsing... They do not change back and forth between Human and Werewolf in rapid fire succession as did Hugh Jackman, the transformations here are done with much more care and respect to the original 1941 Wolfman.In fact, this new Wolfman film is actually frightening in some spots, it is not campy in the least, and there is no humour - It is a solemn story told with true reservation and respect to the original material.This film is rife with great actors and actresses, Geraldine Chaplain has a good part in this as Mavela. Benicio del Toro hides his Spanish background and becomes Lawrence Talbot and even gives the part as much as Lon Chaney Jr did... The Great Hugo Weaving and Anthony Hopkins give surprise performances.This film truly had some shocking moments, and there is one major reveal that caught me unsuspected. When a story cannot be predicted even with foreknowledge of the basic plot, that becomes a good film.Atmosperically, this film rivals Tim Burton's "Sleepy Hollow" but without the Burton-isms, but the same ominous atmosphere.There are a couple of things that are not explained, who was the man on the train? I looked for references to this but it is not explained. But other than that, I enjoyed this a lot more than most of the films that have been released lately.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had the chance to be one of the best werewolf movies ever but it falls short and here is why. The great thing about this movie is its direction and cinematography, the atmosphere is filled with suspense and intrigue, the score adds well to the situation, and we have some nice chilling scenes, but that's all we get, the movie isn't emotionally engaging, you have no sympathy with the characters, at any point in the movie ask yourself this question, would I care if any of these people die? the answer is always No. The dialogue is weak and they use very short sentences, they didn't give a chance to the actors and actresses to shine, and the characters are truly linear and the plot is very predictable. All in all, this movie is all style with no substance, so if you are in the mood for something like that, or if you are one of those people who can appreciate great cinematography and artful direction without regard to the characters and plot, you will like it, otherwise you won't miss much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully dark and dreary...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it lacks the pathos of the Chaney, Jr. version, this one boasts far more impressive sets (and settings), cinematography, and makeup fx. Lousy cgi have been shoe-horned in and actually manage to detract from all else. Del Toro does a commendable job in the title role, evincing some genuine depth of emotion early on (especially when haunted by echoes from his past), but the lack of a true romance hurts the film (the "budding relationship" gets nipped in said bud just when it should've blossomed); and when he professes his love, late in the going, it simply doesn't ring true. Anthony Hopkins comes close to stealing the show, but this is clearly Del Toro's time to shine- and shine he does. Whenever Del Toro is on screen, he commandeers center stage. Hugo Weaving is about as competent as one might expect an actor to be in a role essentially little more than an attitude, but that's about it. Paul Naschy made a career out of lycanthropy; I see no reason whatsoever why Del Toro couldn't do the same. He's certainly off to a good start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rick Baker is proved right!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the ever-lowering standards of major Hollywood movies and the establishment of films made by committee, malleable directors have never had it better.The Wolfman is a case in point. Everything, from script, casting, direction and special effects are appalling.The director himself admits to not even bothering to create images in-camera on-set!! The highly anticipated transformation of man to wolf was filmed with absolutely no practical make-up effects at all. The "director" simply asked the actor to move and contort anticipating that all issues would be fixed in post-production with the use of computer-generated imagery.Rick Baker designed the final make-ups and almost begged to design the transformations with the combined use of practical make-ups enhanced with CGI. This desire on Rick Baker's part to out do his stunning work on An American Werewolf in London (1981) was rejected out of hand.Baker expressed his doubts that a convincing transformation could be achieved solely by using CGI. The Wolfman's computer animators have proved that CGI is only as good as the person's artistic talent in creating them. The Wolfman's computer-generated imagery is totally unconvincing. It harks back to the lack of tactility so evident in the atrocious committee picture, I Am Legend. There is nothing to say about the myriad of other problems that plague this 150 million debacle.</fullReview>

I'm glad that Gwen survived because she really didn't deserve to die and it just wouldn't have been right to kill her. I surprised to see AH turn into a wolf then bome a stripper then die. Well it certianlly will beat any sand dunes picture accept for anoes. It was smart that Universal pictures made the picture well scince they were the ones who made original.

		<fullReview>going to a big budget Hollywood action movie usually ends up with a disappointment over shallow scenario, yet you feel somehow entertained by all how it's done technically. So, I expected the same, with a slight chance that it can be a bit above average, as both lead actors are good. Yet I must say that this was one of the worst movies i've seen in recent months - pretty bad acting, frequently lame special effects, boring and way way too obvious flow of the movie. I would say "better rent it", but honestly I don't think it's worth watching it even at home :/ 6.5/10 for some visual effects and camera work, 2/10 for scenario, 4/10 for acting, total - weak 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wolfman - A Remake Too Far?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, what can I say? I went into this one with my eyes wide open and no real expectations that it would be any good, and I still found the new remake of "The Wolfman"(2010) a big disappointment. Now this one has been sitting around waiting for a release for quite some time and having seen the final product I think I can see why. "The Wolfman" is a remake of the 1941 Universal classic which tells the story of Larry Talbot, who returns to Wales upon the death of his brother and gets bitten by a werewolf, thus becoming cursed himself. The remake moves the story to England and stretches out the slim storyline interminably. Indeed, for the first half at least I found it extremely hard to actually stay awake. The biggest problem with this remake is that it is dull, dull, dull. It looks beautiful (although the colors are so muted it would have looked better in monochrome) but the camera crawls around at a snail's pace, begging us to drool over the carefully CGI'd landscapes and the beautifully dressed sets.One of the other major problems with "The Wolfman" is that due to the sparse script there are no characters that the audience can actually care about. Benicio Del Toro as Lawrence Talbot broods his way through the title role, while Anthony Hopkins sleepwalks his way through his part as Larry's "evil for no apparent reason" father. Emily Blunt plays Larry's love interest but sadly has no interesting lines or scenes; a waste of a good actress.On the positive side, the special make-up effects by legendary Rick Baker are truly excellent. He gives a very Old Skool look to the proceedings and the transformation scenes work very well. In places, this retelling of the werewolf story almost comes close to being a true Hammer homage, with Del Toro's look echoing that of Oliver Reed in the 1961 classic "Curse of the Werewolf" but the clichéd fiery finale becomes more pastiche than homage. All in all, yet another reason for Hollywood to just stop it now with the tired, flaccid remakes and failed rehashes of past glories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in Victorian England, this remake could of so easily been a terrifying horror spurting Gothic cool and throwback charm. Alas, 'Wolfman' doesn't actually take its self too seriously, and whilst its entertaining for the most part, I wasn't convinced by either the script or the badly drawn characters. So what your left with are the admittedly very gratifying visual effects and the rather pleasing amount of gore. If only this picture had taken the time to flesh out the story and the characters, the wait between action sequences wouldn't have felt so dis-engaging. With the level of talent involved, I expected more that what was delivered but still had a good time - just switch your brain off!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today you might be better off attending a bonfire of $20 bills than going to the movies. That's what it's come down to. How much money do they throw at this garbage? One hundred million? More? Same old thing. No writers in sight. We got art directors, lighting experts, cinematographers, even...hmmmm...maybe...actors...but we ain't got no writers! This is the Wolfman for the crowd who is buzzing on Red Bull and Mountain Dew. The scares are supposedly produced by loud noises and sudden movements. There is an attempt at atmosphere, yes, but the special effects typically overwhelm it. Needless characters are introduced, and their main purpose seems to be to shoot more guns.A little sadism and torture is thrown in. Gotta get those teenagers gasping.Anyway, the special effects of man/wolf transformation is kind of blah. We saw it all before thirty years ago. Naturally, if you pay your ten bucks, you get to see explosions. In a wolfman movie? Yeah. That's modern screen writing for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sir Anthony Hopkins has established a reputation for being a tour-De-force in nearly every movie he has starred in. Now, Director Joe Johnston has taken the Andrew Walker/David Self novel and updated the original 1940's version. The movie is called " The Wolfman " and it's creation is a fantastic remake of Universal's original film. In 1940, it was featured actor Lon Chaney Jr. playing the cursed Lycanthrope, today it's Benicio Del Toro playing Lawrence Talbot. To bring an aura of superb acting, we have Sir Anthony Hopkins as Sir John Talbot. The story as originally created by the Greeks, later the Romans and perpetuated by the European Gypsies is about an ordinary man who is attacked by a throat-tearing Werewolf. A successful stage actor (benicio Del Toro) is summoned back to his ancestral home of Blackmore. Learning his brother was savagely mauled by a mysterious monster, Talbot seeks to discover the truth. Once home, he is followed by a Scotland Yard Inspector named Abberline (Hugo Weaving) to see if the family or the village is cursed. With distinguished actor Max Von Sydow in a cameo role, this movie is sure to please avid collectors. The movie itself is a wonderful tribute to the 1940's film and updates nearly all the aspects which gave it life. From the shadowy, dark forests, the torch carrying villagers to the neck ripping, howls of the shape-shifting creature, all combine to establish for all time, a true Classic for the modern age. Easily recommended to anyone seeking an action packed triller. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrendous Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wolfman aimed for Horror and came up nothing short of Horrendous. The way I've described the film to friends already is that if you've heard this sound before, "Grrrrr", then you've seen the Wolfman already. The only redeemable qualities of this movie are the score by Danny Elfman and the Sound FX. Other than the sound, this film is just a pathetic rehash of an otherwise cheesy creature feature franchise to begin with. I'll begin by critiquing the poor graphics and visuals because as bad as they are, they still far outweigh the most generic and predictable story I may have ever seen. The overall color scheme, post- shooting compositing, and camera shot choices were overall commendable, but the actual FX from Makeup to Computer Graphics made this film look more outdated than the original Wolfman. As a graduate in Digital Media from Drexel University, I firsthand understand the difficulty associated with attempting to model, render, and animate photo-realistic creatures covered in fur and hair. To simulate the correct lighting to convince the viewer the hair is real or even flesh for that matter takes great attention to detail and is typically near impossible to emulate exactly. Well, Wolfman tried and failed. From the instant the movie reveals a CG Animated Dancing Bear to the cameo of Smeagle from the Lord of the Rings Series, both hair and flesh looked horrendous. The lighting didn't blend and therefore the graphics appeared ancient and cheesy like the creature feature story and amateur makeup that the franchise was once nostalgically associated with but now in a modern age only appears amateur and in bad taste. The makeup for the werewolves, in its own respect, showed little to no creativity. There was no attempt to push the franchise further and create a new, terrifying stylized image of what the Wolfman would look like. The Wolfman looked identical to the old classic wolfman, which in my perspective looked like a cute flat puppy mask with nice combed back hair; in no way terrifying. For the Wolfman to work, the creature would have needed to look far more menacing and much more like an actual blood-hungry wolf rather than a docile puppy to be taken seriously. During the film, I was constantly saying to myself, "I think Teen Wolf could take this guy". A true menacing wolf-man creature after transformation would need to have an intimidating height-increase combined with a terrifying hunch to show its imperfection as a monster and exaggerate how unnatural it is, but instead the wolfman exhibits perfect symmetry, no height change, and an almost spot-on Old English Posture. Aside from the figure itself, the wolfman's face needed a major upgrade as well to be terrifying. I was expecting to see a face I could only barely recognize as once being human, perhaps with a long canine snout with jagged teeth, contorted skull, eyes more to the side of the head, and mangy hair rather than a cultured human with a button nose and combed hair glued to his face. Although done well in many films before, the transformation sequences were rather impressive in combination with the Sound FX, and the clothing/wardrobe design for the wolfman before and after transformation were pretty awesome as well. So, aside from the fashion and sound designer(s), whoever was responsible for stylizing and rendering the characters of this film should just be fired. Using cheesy makeup as a prime example, throughout the entire film it was difficult to decide whether the producers were trying to pay homage to the classic or just make money off of a rehash with a moniker that would bring viewers out regardless of quality. Even the story was completely straight forward and predictable from the beginning. The vague attempts to throw off the viewer are almost an insult since the second the viewer thinks they have the story figured out, it plays out as predicted without a single plot twist to surprise or inspire. Spoiler Alert. Clearly, Anthony Hopkins is the original Wolfman from the beginning. The movie mentions that before Anthony Hopkins was a wolfman, there was a little feral boy who lived in a cave that bit and made him the wolfman. Although the feral boy is touched upon, he is never brought up again and never comes full circle to surprise the viewer. In my perspective, the only way the story could have been redeemed was to somehow tie-in a feral boy plot twist that changes presupposed thoughts about the nature of the wolfman, or reveal that Anthony Hopkins isn't a wolfman and that the beast that was killing everyone was actually the female lead, presumed to be simply a victim rather than a mastermind. Now speaking of the cast, this movie is a great example of how Benicio Del Toro just ruined his own career. Anthony Hopkins played his typical omniscient, omnipotent creepy role and pulled it off with grace, while Hugo Weaving, in portraying a ruthless authority figure, similar to his Matrix role, pulled off an excellent performance as well. The female lead, Emily Blunt, played her conflicted widow part rather well, too, so it is a shame that Benicio Del Toro came in and massacred the lead acting of an already horrible film. For a character seeking revenge, Benicio Del Toro's acting made his character Lawrence appear entirely indifferent to his condition and the world around him. Slumping around with lethargic movements, Benicio just looked bored playing his parts. And to touch on the awkwardness of not knowing if this movie is paying homage to the classic film, Benicio's acting as the transformed wolfman seemed so jerky and full of old theatrical exaggeration that it broke the third wall and took my engagement out of the film and focused my disinterest on viewing the movie as a portrayal of an old cinema cheesy horror monster stuck in a modern film. In summation, the movie is horrendous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What shame this movie was, such great actors giving like half of what they could have given, Benicio del Toro? what a generic soulless performance, Hopkins is .... you know, Hopkins... Emily Blunt and Hugo Weaving where the best ones. The pace of the movie is really annoying, the CG effects of the mansion are soooo bad, was it so difficult to find a big manor in england and put some leafs and branches on the front to make it look old? The "love story" and I want to emphasize the "'s is cold, you don't relate to them or their pain and this is due to bad screenplay... I really wanted to like this one, the scares are very cheap high pitch booms that of course make all the cinema jump but more to ear damage!

This is out and out horror. The makeup is fantastic. The CGI and the little that they used is very well done. The fact we don't have some lame CGI werewolf running around London is a great decision by the people involved with this film.I thought the casting was great.

		<shortDescription>Wolfman getting long in the tooth ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we have a modern remake of the original Wolfman movie with Benicio Del Toro, Emily Blunt and Anthony Hopkins in the leading roles. My opinion on it is not extreme either way. It's not terrible and it's not great. It has a certain retro vibe to it and I cannot tell you how faithful or not it is to the original which I've never seen. I was mostly entertained although I checked the time a few times indicating that either the movie was a bit long or that the pace wasn't quite right. Benicio Del Toro in the leading role certainly looked the part with his unconventional features but he didn't blow me away with his interpretation that seemed too restrained and cold. On the other hand, Emily Blunt was just wonderful showing lots of emotions with just her eyes. Hopkins as the father of the future wolfman was slightly over the top and campy but nothing major.The story was interesting although predictable (I guessed who the original wolfman was from the start). Special mention should go to the asylum sequence that was not only intense but also creatively shot. I didn't find the movie particularly scary although there are a few surprise attacks from the wolfman that make you jump and very quick gory scenes that make you cringe. The set design and cinematography was very good and atmospheric recreating the foggy landscapes and towns of Victorian England. The wolfman sequences were appropriately quick, feral and savage and it did help that it was the real actors under the costumes instead of CGI although I'm sure some viewers will think it looks fake. I enjoyed seeing the first complete on-camera transformation, a long time coming, and thought it was effective. I think a lot more could have been done with the internal conflict raging inside Del Toro's character and especially how it affects his relationships. He looked more resigned and passive than tormented. I also wish I could have been more emotionally involved with the tragedies going on but I wasn't. So all in all, a decent remake, certainly watchable but that could have benefited from a stronger leading actor and a more inspired storyline.Rating: 6 out of 10 (good)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wait for cable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This latest entry into the werewolf genre offers little more than a particularly stodgy, sumptuously-shot MASTERPIECE THEATER installment that happens to have werewolves and gory graphic violence (which was easily the best thing about the film). That's all you really need to know, especially if you're familiar with the basic plot of the 1941 original. I won't bother with a recap of the story, except to say that it's the standard tragic werewolf yarn, tarted up with CGI, so here are the pertinent points, both good and bad:* IT'S DULL. The film has a look and feel that simply screams "period piece" and makes you wonder when the PBS pledge break is going to interrupt the proceedings. The pacing for the first half is turgid and the movie does not come to life until the protagonist visits a gypsy camp in search of answers. The only times the film really kicks into any kind of gear is when the werewolf does his thing, which amounts to a total of less than fifteen minutes.* IT ISN'T SCARY. When a horror film doesn't provide either suspense or scares, there's a problem.* ANTHONY HOPKINS PHONES IT IN. The former Hannibal Lecter practically sleepwalks through his performance and even shifts to a completely different accent at one point, eliciting giggles from the matinée crowd. He quite obviously was only there for the paycheck.* BENICIO DEL TORO IS SYMPATHETIC, BUT KINDA OUT OF IT. As Lawrence Talbot, Del Toro affects the same hangdog demeanor as Lon Chaney Jr. did in the original and we do care about him to an extent, but what is meant to convey tragic intensity instead comes off as being whacked-out on Quaaludes.* IT'S ALL ABOUT "DADDY ISSUES." The whole film is more about Talbot's deep and well-founded issues with his father than anything else, and once we've twigged to that the story enters allegorical "After-School Special" territory.* WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO RICK BAKER? Makeup groundbreaker Rick Baker heads the makeup team and comes up with werewolf suits that, while well-crafted, bear a striking resemblance to high-end Halloween costumes. Considering his past dabblings into the lupine, I expected a whole lot better in terms of realism, but I did like the designs.* AN ANNOYING OVER-RELIANCE ON CGI. As I feared, the CGI effects tend to overwhelm the practical effects and they are painfully obvious to spot. The worst offenders are a digitally-rendered bear and stag that look wholly unnatural to anyone who's ever seen a nature special.* DANNY ELFMAN MUST BE STOPPED. The former genius of Oingo Boingo returns with yet anther of his many sound-alike scores. Enough with this guy, already!* IT'S RATED "R" FOR A REASON. In this wimped-out movie climate, it's good to receive a horror film that gives us monster scenes replete with stuff that would never fly in a PG-13 flick. * THE SCENES OF WEREWOLF VIOLENCE ARE EXCELLENT. Any time there's a werewolf on screen engaging in anti-social activity, the film is worth sitting through. The sequences in the gypsy camp and the London asylum will go down as classics and there is plenty of gore on hand. I'd read that this was a troubled production and that Rick Baker was called in to add more "goodies" to the mix, so I can't imagine what this film would have been like without its high level of blood, guts and savage decapitations.* THE FEMALE LEAD SERVES VIRTUALLY NO PURPOSE TO THE NARRATIVE. Emily Blunt's role is one of the most thankless in recent memory and her character would have been totally unnecessary if the plot did not require her to fall in love with the cursed protagonist.* IT'S LEFT WIDE-OPEN FOR A SEQUEL. This was totally expected, but after the rest of the film I could not care less if a sequel comes to pass.So what we have here is a pretty-to-look-at lycanthropic costume drama with some decent gore/violence and zero scares. The audience I saw it with was quite obviously not satisfied with what they got, and for the first time since I cannot remember when, over half of the audience had gotten up and walked out before the final reel. Seriously, people just got up and walked out in droves. With that in mind, I strongly advise you to wait for cable or give it a miss entirely, unless you are a die-hard werewolf groupie like me. And even as a sworn, lifelong werewolf supporter, I doubt I'll be sitting through this one again. Stick with the 1941 original, and you won't go wrong.</fullReview>

I say drama as the performances particularly Benicio Del Toro, are simply what carry the movie.The acting is is simply excellent and even Emily Blunt is not wasted as the love interest, usually the female roles most of the time in horror is simply scream and rip clothes of, not here. She is quite exquisite in this.Not only is the werewolf change great, Joe Johnston's directing is pleasing to the eye, even the fighting and gore, which there is a lot off. I saw this in local cinema here in England, 35 mm print, why was it not digital, again. But still looked good.

		<shortDescription>Anthony Hopkins Chews Scenery &amp; Gypsies in Wolfman!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mysterious, Gothic feel of The Wolfman was really well-done. Unlike the 1941 Lon Chaney, Jr. version, which took place in the then-contemporary WWII Europe, this picture takes place in 1890s England, apparently right outside of London, in the inevitably named "Blackmoor." Nice.Benicio del Toro seems a bit miscast at first glance. But viewers find out early in the film that Sir Talbot married a Latin woman, so Benitio's Latin looks makes sense. Without the "Why me?" look of Lon Chaney, Jr., Benicio had the fear of God in him instead.This fear seemed real and sincere, as he discovers he is cursed. Cursed from the bite of a werewolf. He implores the local gypsies to help him but this version of Maleva is not much help. Her advice is to put Larry Talbot out of his misery. Silver bullets no extra charge.Quite a surprise as to who the other werewolf is (no spoilers here). The duo werewolf smack-down will make any WWE fan proud.Larry getting captured and locked up in a mental asylum was quite intense. The director's view of psychiatry as a barbaric science with its use of ice-baths to cure delusion and sticking him with some kind of drugs has, unfortunately, not changed that much in 21st century psychiatric practice. We've graduated to electric-shock treatments from ice-baths. A true horror story.The transformation of the man to wolf is great. Memories of The American Werewolf in London will come to you, and naturally so, because Rick Baker had something to do with both films. But where to the wolf-man's clothes go? Does he pick up after himself after each transformation? But I digress.As in the first Universal picture, there is a mild love interest. It's a subdued, subplot however.Anthony Hopkins is delightfully demented as Sir Talbot, Sr. The Gothic mansion atop the hill with moon shining down in its full glory is so iconic -- and the fake time-lapse movement of our lunar neighbor as it glows through the dead tree branches and storm clouds brings back more memories of Universal pictures past.Example: The usual villagers with torches marching through the forest (with the baying dogs and such, reminiscent of Frankenstein). The deep howl of the wolf-man as he bays at the moon, as he gorges on the liver and intestines of his latest victim. Oh, the hopping from the rooftops, again reminiscent of Henry Hall's wolf-man, Werewolf of London (which predates Chaney's version).The music evokes a mood and the plot moves along quite swiftly. At times, the audience is surprised as if the director says "boo" out of a closet or something. He does this a bit too often, but it's still fun to do.If you are any kind of a Universal fan and have waited for a more adult treatment of this film, then you really should watch this film. See how many iconic pictures you can spot as Universal digs deep into its vault of horror.So don't be a cynic -- turn off your brain, don't think, and enjoy this bit of entertainment.Warning: much gore and decapitations ensue!I understand Bride of Frankenstein is coming soon. Pray it ain't Anne Hathaway!Of course, you can always pick up the originals!</fullReview>

I like it all the way, it was a bit slow moving at times, but that helped set the theme in a good way, they could have removed about 15 minutes by taken a little bit of here and there.The cast that have been chosen and the acting they deliver makes it very enjoyable to watch.

		<shortDescription>It wasn't a very good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lycanthropy is a prevailing legend in popular culture and it has made its way into yet another movie. The classic legend is simple enough ? get bitten by a werewolf and become one with all of the benefits and perks (fast healing, etc) until the next full moon ? then the victim becomes a werewolf and hunts anything in his path in a ravenous frenzy. Those enjoying Frankenstein in popular culture shall appreciate this movie in which a nobleman tries to understand his past, why his mother and sister are dead, and what the fate will be of the mysterious werewolf that has been haunting the nearby village.This movie is nothing short of one man drunk on his own happiness, another that can't believe what is going on, and then a froth of mindless violence between villagers, wolfmen and anyone that dare get caught inbetween. There is hearsay, fingers are pointed, blame is placed and ultimately someone is going to die. Silver bullets or not, there will be lots of gore in this movie, so do not watch if you are squeamish or faint of heart. If you are into darker movies that touch up on the paranormal, into some of the older human legends that prevail in modern society, then this is the movie for you.This are a few emotional aspects to this movie that some will appreciate, and dare I say some might even respect; but the rehearsal of such a thing probably won't be any good for this movie ? despite an older culture aspect and heritage that is prominent in many romance stories, this movie is strangely lacking in one aspect ? the male lead does not give into the whims of his lover, nor is she successful in converting and saving him.Originally posted to Orion Age (http://www.orionphysics.com/?p=502)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Benicio Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt and Hugo Weaving star in this 2010 horror remake of the 1941 classic, "The Wolf Man." This takes place in the 1800's where we meet Lawrence Talbot (Del Toro) who returns home to England after his brother, Ben (Simon Merrells) is brutally killed. He meets Ben's fiancée, Gwen Conliffe (Blunt) and helps her find his killer. Soon, Lawrence is injured by a werewolf and starts to feel different. He discovers that he's cursed with the mark of the beast and will change when the moon is full. He also finds romance with Gwen who soon realizes what's happening to him. Hopkins (Hannibal) plays his estranged father, Sir John and Weaving (V for Vendetta) plays Scotland Yard Inspector, Alberline. This isn't a bad remake, but not as good as the original. The cast is good, there's great make-up by Rick Baker (Minus the CGI effects), great score by Danny Elfman as usual and Del Toro sort of resembles the late, Lon Chaney Jr. from the original. I still recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark Remake of a Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to see why Benecio Del Toro was cast in the lead for this remake. He bears an eerie resemblance to Lon Chaney Jr., and he portrays Lawrence Talbot like Chaney did- as the the same half mad, tortured soul.On a technical level, it's a successful movie for the special effects era, but the complete result of the the elements is a dark, violent and utterly charmless movie. The characters seem purposely ugly. The Victorian London theme has been done so well so many times that you're disappointed that you don't like the setting, let alone what's going on in the picture. Anthony Hopkins is kind of the go-to guy in horror movie remakes, and he gets a decent part here as Talbot's father, although you'll find out that he's not the same good guy that Claude Rains was in the 1941 original.I don't know what it is about werewolf movies. It seems hard to make a decent one for some reason. If you like movies set in foggy Victorian era London, check out Murder by Decree with Christopher Plummer. It's everything this movie should be but isn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needed to take itself more seriously.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given how long this thing spent in post-production, enduring multiple re-shoots it's a great deal better than one would expect. It looks beautiful (as long as it stays out of a tediously CG London) with suitably bleak, and Gothic location work. The performances are solid all around with Anthony Hopkins, who could do (and occasionally has done) this sort of thing in his sleep, stealing the show. The downfall is the amount of time spent slyly referencing other werewolf movies and otherwise planting its tongue deep in its cheek.The werewolf rips someone out through the side of a tent - Bad Moon.The rampage through London (right down to a bus crash) - American Werewolf in London.The dream sequences - see above.The dismembered arm firing a gun - Wolfen.Someone falls from a high window and is impaled on railings - Howling 2.It goes on.The last one is an example of how gratuitous the violence is. Once someone has been thrown out a window, the railings are a predictable bit of overdoing it. The whole film, in fact, suffers from being predictable which helps explain the lack of genuine scares, let alone suspense. This isn't just because the tale is familiar. Most viewers will be able to call each scene and even each shot ahead of time.Back to the violence. The body count is astronomical and the extremely graphic nature of the assorted disembowelings, dismemberings, decapitations and so forth ultimately combine to produce a sense of silliness.The werewolf itself (or themselves to be precise) is a lovely piece of work that proves that the legendary Rick Baker (who has about the briefest cameo imaginable) is able to co-exist with CGI just fine. The desire to make it look reminiscent of the original Wolfman is understandable and the fact that it doesn't look particularly canine doesn't detract. The real problem is that it doesn't move or behave in a remotely wolf-like manner. The primate-like movements are so pronounced as to be distracting and to make one wonder what director Joe Johnston was thinking.Having said all of that, it's a decent evening's entertainment if not, perhaps, a justifiable use of a hundred and fifty million dollars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugo Weaving was great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's start with the good things: Rick Baker was already loved for his effects in werewolf movies like An American Werewolf in London, and Wolf, as well as other movies where even if the movie's bad like Planet of the Apes, his work is excellent and kudos for getting him back. Baker clearly has respect for make-up legend Jack Pierce and the make-up is fantastic. I'm not a fan of CGI and I'm glad the movie cut itself down a bit although it did include it in some scenes. But Baker's work clearly shows.Hugo Weaving was great and while Anthony Hopkins had a rougher start, he still did rather well. His character is harder than Rain's portrayal but in some ways it works. Certainly more than it did for his portrayal of Van Helsing in my eyes. The settings were fantastic. There's a lot of 19th century buildings that look gorgeous and act as a perfect contrast to the dark and creepy woods. Now for the bad: The build-up in many scenes was rather limited. The asylum scene was okay, but many scenes could have built the tension better. The acting from del Toro and Blunt was rather unemotional. I found Gwen Conliffe to be more supportive in this version, but Blunt's emotions were limited. She's a beautiful woman however no doubt. del Toro looks a bit like Lon Chaney Jr. and does well in the make-up, but the Larry side is bland. He's just not able to play it as tragically as Chaney. What's more while some complained that Chaney being Claude Rains son was absurd I can sooner believe in werewolves than the idea del Toro and Hopkins are kin. Another flaw is the limited screen time of Maleva the old gypsy a key character in the original. She's okay in this, but given little to do which really ticks me off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A faithful remake, for good and ill.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of the 1941 horror classic that's perhaps a bit too faithful to the original for its own good, The Wolfman is a suitably dark, moody and gory alternative to the shirtless, male model lycanthropes from the Twilight films.Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) is an American actor in 1891 who is summoned back to the English home he left as a child by the disappearance and then death of his brother. Talbot returns to find his father (Anthony Hopkins) a lurking enigma, his brother's beautiful fiancée Gwen (Emily Blunt) and the local villagers stirred up by a string of brutal, animalistic killings. Seeking answers in his brother's murder, Talbot visits a band of gypsies and gets himself bitten by a mysterious beast. Well?okay, it's not that mysterious. When the next full moon rises, Talbot transforms into a werewolf and goes on a bloody rampage. Returning to his human form, Talbot is capture by Scotland Yard Inspector Abberline (Hugo Weaving) and shipped off to a London asylum. The torments of the Victorian mental health system last only another month and the next full moon frees Talbot to conduct another wolfen rampage. When the dawn restores his humanity again, Talbot resolves to strike back and destroy the true origins of his curse, while Abberline and Gwen race to see which of them can get to Talbot first and either slay or save him.If you're a fan of 1940s monster movies, this is as close to one as you're going to get in modern cinema. The Wolfman is brooding and suspenseful and has no sense of humor at all about itself, unlike The Mummy films of the past decade. It also does a good job of recognizing that everyone already knows the story it's telling and acknowledging that fact by not forcing the characters to fumble around in ignorance and look like morons to the audience. Today's viewers know werewolf lore backward and forwards, so the movie wisely doesn't try and keep any of that stuff a mystery for very long.Benicio Del Toro brings a haunted and solemn feel to Talbot that is exactly what the character needs. Emily Blunt is quite lovely and does everything she can with a typically thankless female role, playing less of a person and more a servant of the Almighty Plot Hammer. She also provides some nice side boob action. Hugo Weaving mostly just runs, yells and shoots, though there is a neat scene where Inspector Abberline subtly but unquestionably lays down the law to a local villager. Anthony Hopkins is doing more scenery-nibbling than acting here, but he can pull it off like most great actors at this stage of their careers.There is a lot of graphic violence in The Wolfman, with plenty of severed limbs and entrails strewn all over the place. It's logical, given what the teeth and claws of a werewolf would do, but it might be a little jarring if you're not expecting it.This film turns back the clock on the image of the werewolf. Instead of a man transforming into a giant wolfish beast, which has become the standard for these movies since An American Werewolf In London, this movie goes back to the idea of a humanoid figure with wolf characteristics. In other words, this wolfman doesn't have a snout. It's a throwback visual that worked for me but could leave some viewers snickering.There are a few new wrinkles added, but most of the story follows the course of the original Wolfman. That becomes a bit problematic as the movie goes along. When they remake Frankenstein or Dracula, they can go back to the original, well regarded novels for inspiration. This film only has a 1941 screenplay to work with and that script didn't exactly have a lot of depth or breadth to it. The Wolfman has a decent opening act but as the story limps along, you can tell how little is going on both plot-wise and thematically.The Wolfman would make a great drive-in movie where you can pay attention to the good bits and make out with your date the rest of the time. Since there really aren't any more drive-ins around, I can't call this movie more than okay.</fullReview>

I know nothing about the original, even if The Wolf Man is my favourite universal classic monster. So I was excited to hear they were doing a revamp on the movie and with a great cast. Then I hear rumblings of trouble on the production side of things, I try to ignore what I hear and go into every movie with an open mind. The Wolfman is not a terrible movie, simply a misguided one. I must say that the film looks marvelous, the set design, costume and cinematography really shine in this film. They captured that time era really elegantly. Second, the makeup effects from the legend Rick Baker are phenomenal and I hope an Oscar win comes his way. I respect the fact that they went the traditional route and went with authentic rather than full on CGI *cough* An American Werewolf in Paris *cough*. The rapid use of CGI to conquer the monsters of late has grow tiresome. Back then, CGI was the rave, even if it looked cheap and bad. Here, we have a genuine look that feels and actually looks real. With every werewolf film, you wonder what the transformation sequence is going to look like. I still think that to this day, no other film has captured it quite like An American Werewolf in London has. Sometimes the transformation sequence can make or break a film. The Howling does a decent job, An American Werewolf in Paris does not. I'm sorry I keep hating on that movie, but it really is bad. The Wolfman has their transformation sequence in CGI. No real complaints here. It looks painful, at times a bit fake, but interesting nonetheless. All the cast involved do their job, no one seems to go above and beyond. You get what is expected out of Hopkins, Del Toro and Weaving. Blunt fills the role of crying woman well enough. Their so called romantic plot between the two is boring, uninteresting and not realistic. It feels like a studio head wanted this in to try and sell more tickets. Again, knowing nothing about the original, I knew who the first werewolf was and the film didn't even try to hide it. The werewolf vs werewolf sequence was interesting, but a more action turn than horror for the third act. The Wolfman is a mediocre film that isn't really action, isn't really horror. It's full of some brutal killings and blood left right and centre, so some horror enthusiasts will be pleased. I found most of the film to be drawn out and a tad boring. Even the suspenseful chase scenes were yawn inducing. The Wolfman has great technical achievements, but weak story and characters are enough for a pass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'll tell ya this much, The Wolfman ain't no Teen Wolf!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Teen Wolf 2 aside there hasn't been a decent werewolf movie for years, and no classic one since An American Werewolf in London almost 30 years ago.According to werewolf-movies.com (yes this site really does exist) Ginger Snaps and Dog Soldiers are the only furry films that gained the coveted "4 full moons" in the last decade (I agree), alas Werewolf in a Women's Prison was not rated. Aside from those two there were over a hundred more mediocre werewolf related films, there were a couple of average yet watchable efforts and basically 90% of outright suckage. The 90s were even worse with nothing to howl about, then it's all the way back the afore-mentioned as the only "classic".So last year when The Wolfman, a big budget film with Benny Del Toro in the furry suit and other real actors, I wondered how it might fare.In short, add it to the 90% pile. The Wolfman is nothing more than dull.And I watched the unrated edition hoping for a little more "wolfiness".***************************************** Benicio Del Toro is Laurence Talbot, a well regarded and renowned actor in New York circa 1900. One day he is visited post performance by his brother's fiancé, she informs him that the brother is missing and has been for a month, feared dead. She believes it would be best if Laurence goes home to London to help with the vigil. Laurence sez no.Cut to Laurence en route to London via train. We learn that he is obviously a man of great conviction and true to his word. A strange man on the train offers Laurence an ornately designed cane complete with a hidden sword. Laurence graciously sez no. As he alights from the train he finds the man has gone and the cane is still in the carriage, so he takes it.I told you before the man's word is binding!!! Laurence shows up home to meet with his Father played by Anthony Hopkins in a scene that has already been played out in countless other movies, believe it or not I even picked the exact moment where he would say "The prodigal Son returns", and lo and behold seconds later out it came, it was just that predictable. Laurence and Father share a stilted relationship, indeed early on Hopkins doesn't seem to give a toss that his famous estranged son has returned home, and the conversations between them are pained and forced.It turns out that Laurence is too late and that his brother has been found dead and basically with chunks missing. His now widow Gwen (Emily Blunt) wants answers dammit! So Laurence noses around for info, and it is when he visits a local gypsy camp that he is (finally) attacked and the film finds some sort of brief momentum.Laurence is very nearly dead, a gypsy says that "He can only be released by someone who loves him". So the rest of the film was just mapped out with one statement then.Near death one night, ship shape and fighting fit the next morning. Good ole Dad and Gwen stay to see him back to full health, but the locals are sceptical and worried by his almost instant recovery, and the police (Hugo Weaving) show up to investigate the death of his brother and many other locals.Is Laurence OK? Is something amiss? Anyone asking these questions needs to revisit the poster, but the rest of the film tries to explain everything, including a backstory that needn't have existed. It becomes a matter of who will get him first? The cops, his Dad, the locals, or will he resolve his situation himself? In reality by the time the film ended I had long since stopped caring, the crux of the picture was the "relationship a tois" between Laurence, Dad and Gwen, but because there was little spark or chemistry between any of the three the film fell very flat and became disinteresting.I did jot down the following curios.- The beast is large, snarling and very vicious, yet in the aftermath he wakes up again human and for some reason fully clothed? - The transformation sequences in An American Werewolf? were far more realistic and effective, and they weren't just CGI like they are here.- The unrated stuff is indeed more violent, but only in as much as they obviously asked "well instead of slashing his chest why not cut his head off?", then they did just that, only it looks so fake that there is no impact. This was violence for people who never watch violent movies.The backdrops are lush and exquisite, the sets well designed and lustrous, and the tone uniformly dark, even during the daytime sequences. However a film isn't only about costuming and set design, and with poor chemistry between the leads, a mediocre plot and not one stand out sequence or scene this is one Wolf begging for a silver bullet.Sometimes "Gothic and Moody" is just a code to cover up "Boring and Slow".Final Rating ? 4.5 / 10. At the bottom of my notes page I just wrote "SUX". Even with my 11 year old boy slang I managed to sum this entire film up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, but watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me be the first to say that I wanted this movie to be good. I mean I REALLY WANTED THIS MOVIE TO BE GOOD. Growing up, like a lot of kids from the 1970's, I was a HUGE fan of the Universal Monsters. I would stay up late every Friday night to watch my local creature feature - "Fright Night", and waited with bated breath for each weeks offering of classic horror. I cut my fan boy teeth on movies like "Bride of Frankenstein", "Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman", "Dracula", "The Mummy", and "Creature From The Black Lagoon", but of all, my favorite was always The original "The Wolf man" starring the vastly underrated Lon Chaney Jr. As a kid I would imagine myself as the title character and would tip-toe (like Chaney in the film) around the woods near my home, playing and acting like a complete idiot.Now that I am grown up, I still think back to those days fondly and still have my love for the Universal Horror films, and when I heard of the Wolf Man remake I must confess that I got a bit giddy with excitement. When I found out Rick Baker (the modern-day Jack Pierce) was involved and that there was going to be actual make-up effects (as opposed to a CGI wolf which was my original fear) I was positively ecstatic. Unfortunately, due to issues beyond my control, I was not able to see the film in its theatrical release. I was, however, the first in line to buy it on Blu-Ray and planned a special evening with my wife and some friends to watch the remake of the beloved classic.Although the movie started out well, I must admit to have been nearly bored to sleep through the first 40 minutes of the film. The pacing was slow and the characters flat and very uninteresting. I actually had to nudge my wife awake several times which is never a good sign. Then the attack at the gypsy camp happens and the film begins to pick up steam. Although it was a watchable film, my final feelings on the film were mixed to say the least. Although the make-up effects were spectacular and Baker created one of the coolest looking wolf man/werewolf characters to date, I found the movie boring and insanely predictable. The pacing was absolutely awful and the story, although original, was not what I was expecting at all. I was expecting more of a cut and dry remake (which would have been acceptable here considering the 60 year age gap) rather than an original story based loosely on the original screenplay and was not blown away by the acting at all. I found the introduction of the Abberline character (in an effort no doubt to peg Abberline as the future perpetrator of the Jack the Ripper murders that would grip London 20 years later) to be utterly pointless. The chemistry between Blunt and Del Toro was lacking for use of a better word and this was by far one of Anthony Hopkins worst performances.That being said, I did find the action/horror sequences to be entertaining and even some startling and was thoroughly amused by the transformation scene in the asylum. Overall, I found this remake to be watchable, but it fell FAR short of my expectations and is not a worthy successor to the original in my opinion. I gave it a 6 out of 10 based solely on the entertainment value of the wolf scenes and nothing else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but not good remake of the 1941 Universal horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joe Johnston (Jurassic Park 3, Hidalgo) is a decent director of corny action/adventure yarns, and as long as The Wolfman concentrates on werewolf set-pieces, it's entertaining enough. Actually, I quite liked the big set-pieces because they were delightfully silly and gory (at least in the unrated version on the DVD). The wolfman will not hesitate to rip you to shreds if you get in his way! Anthony Hopkins is great as Lawrence Talbot's father (I really like the modern, super-hammy Hopkins). Hugo Weaving is also quite good as a Scotland Yard detective investigating the series of grisly murders. Unfortunately, Benicio Del Toro seems miscast as Lawrence Talbot (despite his vague resemblance to Lon Chaney Jr.) and Emily Blunt is incredibly boring as his love interest. The film takes a long time to get going, and, in between the werewolf stuff, can move awfully slowly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unimpressive, unimaginative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wolfman is a try to remake an old horror movie from 1941, Universal spent about 150 Mio $ for that,and despite the huge amount of burnt money and so many horror-movie lovers and stars involved, it still remains not more than a cheap try.Viktorian era Atmosphere is maybe an all-time seller, but in this special case it's the savior from complete disaster, where most of the action, the dialog scenes, especially the wolf masks and the male main actors are - not to say ridiculous, but at least sparsely convincing.The first appearance of the main character Lawrence Talbot (Benicio del TOro) is a scene where he gives Hamlet (I think), and he does it so tired and without any expression that I thought this will be the portrayal of some opium-addicted actor at the very low end of his career. In reality I assume his Hamlet would have got some rotten eggs from his audience, except he plays it likewise about 100 years later. Not really the portrayal of an extremely successful and well-known actor of his time.The scene is cut in the normal copy of the movie, and seemingly also the scene where Talbot drives to his father's manor by train and mysterious old Max von Sydow "forgets" a walking cane with a blade inside for him as a gift. Max, who is one of the best actors living, is only present in this scene, and nobody ever will know why and how he is actually there and cut out. Maybe someone thought he could partially save the movie, but therefore his scene is much too short. Also wasted is Geraldine Chaplins talent and salary with that few words and seconds to act as a Gypsy woman.When Lawrence meets his father Sir John, it is finally revealed that the movie will not be as good as a caliber like Anthony Hopkins promises. Rarely I have seen Mr. Hopkins more uninterested, less involved than here. He's still a professional, but a chemistry with all his co-workers except the dog is simply not present.Lawrence himself seems to be always a little bit stoned, his lips often forming a little 'o', where is no dramaturgical reason for doing so. What he has to say or to feel is mainly unimportant.All characters are mostly cliché and move slowly like earthworms, under a big layer of dust, without any tension. I wonder if that was intended for such a costly production ? To bring the complete foreseeable into a movie only for a reminiscence ? I remember lately enjoying Sherlock Holmes. Not only was the main actor flexible and smart, there were a lot of fun and dialog to enjoy. Wolfman has no fun but a lot of lame action instead, and even the basically good idea to transform the werewolf in front of a full university audience is not executed satisfying, because the beast isn't in the mood to deliver a decent manifestation of its so so horrible blood lust.Most of the things I don't't like on Wolfman belong to the director. The director is responsible if big actors don't bring their top performance, if masks are nearly ridiculous, and he is responsible to recognize timely that the movie will fail. Against a lame script and an outdated plot he can only try to do his best. And that was really not enough in this case.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Victorian story. Slices of an old myth. And a great cast. Nothing special but a fairy movie, with the expected ingredients and the usual feelings, with dark pieces who makes every romantic horror. For me, the star in this case is not Benicio del Toro or Anthony Hopkins. A slender silhouette is the reward for the patience to review a Legendre case. Geraldine Chaplin in the role of Maleva is the amber drop who makes the old tale more that reheated soup. Mystery and aura, tension and respiration of past are the instruments who gives , in the performance of Geraldine, taste to movie. In few words, a new oldest film. Scraps of technique, ancient flavor, some great names and a metamorphosis. The sacrifice as fruit of love and price of harmony. And the end. The rain who wash the shadows of show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The cinematography was right out of 1940 and the characters weren't developed at all. For a while I thought I'd been handed a colourised version of something that was new when my grandfather was going to the movies. This feeling persisted until I saw Hugo Weaving come into the picture and that for some reason completely spoiled it as all I could do from that point on was wait to hear him say, "Mr. Anderson." as he did so frequently in the Matrix movies.Why are people making movies with so little light these days? It does noting for me. Frankly, the only movies worth watching these days have Tim Burton and/or Johnny Depp associated with them.</fullReview>

You didn't get this with the theater version, for some reason they saw fit to cut all of those explanatory scenes out which I completely disagree with because you take those scenes away and all you're left with is a wtf reaction! If you watch the Unrated version this remake was pretty well done. Those who left the theater with the bad taste of this movie in their mouths should definitely give the Unrated another chance!

		<shortDescription>Nice homage to old school horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wolfman is a remake/re-envisaging/whatever they call it these days of those classic Hammer-type horror films of the fifties that were probably in black and white. You may catch them on late at night when you come across a bloke with bushy eyebrows howling at the moon and being chased by Peter Cushine. Anyway, Hollywood have updated that sort of film and thrown in some pretty A-list actors to boot (DelToro, Hopkins, Weaving).The end result is a movie that looks like it's been filmed in the nineteen fifties, but with a better quality camera and nicer special effects. The story isn't so different - man gets bitten by werewolf, becomes one and goes on a rampage, but it's quite nice to see it getting updated.However, recently, with the current fascination with vampires and werewolves, we're kind of grown accustomed to Hollywood creating huge beast-like wolves (Twilight, Dog Soldiers and even the 'wargs' in Lord of the Rings). The Wolfman stays away from this a bit more by paying homage to the old school werewolf. What you have here is men with too much fur and longer claws. Does it work? If you like that sort of thing and can appreciate it's a homage to a distant genre, then yes. Although, if you're expecting Van Helsing-style wolves ripping each other apart, you may think the 'special' effects are a bit on the cheap side.But don't worry - there's still plenty of decapitations and flying body parts to keep the gore-hounds interested.What we have in a deliberately old school horror film, designed to pay homage to the werewolf films of old. And, assuming that this is what the film-makers wanted, they have achieved it nicely.Solid, gory, but probably not to everyone's taste.</fullReview>

Lots of CGI involved and gory bloodshed on the moors.Here Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) returns to his home in Victorian-era England to search for his missing brother and gets attacked by a monster, falling under a curse which causes him to "transform" under the light of the full moon. Anthony Hopkins plays his father and is pretty awesome, with a great accent and a few secrets. There's a bit of a non-romance involved (Emily Blunt) and the ending courtroom scene is awesome.

		<fullReview>Benecio de Toro stars as Lawence Talbot, returning to a family haunted by tragedy; first the loss of his mother and now his brother found torn to pieces by a creature spoken of in hushed whispers at the local pub. Anthony Hopkins plays his father coping with a curse which has enveloped his 17th century estate like a fog. While this remake takes liberties with the relationship between the men originally played by Lon Chaney and Claude Rains The Wolf Man is a genuinely honest attempt to update the material with reverence and respect. The costumes and sets are sumptuous and everything about it is grand and extravagant. The special effects by Rick Baker won the Oscar at the 2011 Academy Awards and the film was also nominated for numerous Saturn Awards. The Wolfman received surprisingly mixed reviews and was ignored at the box office despite it's rich, adventurous storyline which paid homage to everything from An American Werewolf in London to Hammers' The Curse of the Werewolf.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon his return to his ancestral homeland, an American man (Benicio del Toro) is bitten, and subsequently cursed by, a werewolf.A remake of this sort is caught in a no-win trap. If it tries to reinvent the story entirely, it will make some fans upset for deserting the source material. But, on the other hand, coming too close to the original will have people saying there is no way to top the original (which may be true).Benicio del Toro was the obvious choice for the wolf man, and he plays the part well. The cinematography and atmosphere are gorgeous, and the Elfman music is appreciated (and much more subdued than many of his scores). Rick Baker won another Oscar for his makeup here, and who can argue with that? The reviews tended to be negative. Roger Ebert, no fan of horror, gave a lukewarm review of 2.5 stars, but then had to find a flaw regardless of any praise he had: "The film has one flaw, and faithful readers will not be surprised to find it involves the CGI special effects. No doubt there are whole scenes done so well in CGI that I didn't even spot them, but when the werewolf bounds through the forest, he does so with too much speed. He would be more convincing if he moved like a creature of considerable weight." Granted, he is spot on. When you have Baker on your crew, there is no need for CGI (or at least not very much of it). There is no shame in using it when it honestly helps, but when it stands out like a sore thumb, maybe it is time to do a few reshoots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Wolfman" is a tribute to old horror films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No matter how much we deny it, we all love a good scary movie. "The Wolfman" remake is an entertaining an well-made film that has a little too much gore and a perfect amount of drama. Benicio Del Toro is slightly ill-cast as Lawrence Talbot, a young man who is the son of the wealthy Sir Jon Tilbot, the wonderful and perfectly picked Anthony Hopkins. Lawrence's brother was recently killed by a viscous creature that makes Lawrence curious. Lawrence's brothers fiancé Gwen (Emily Blunt) starts to become closer to Lawrence after the death of her fiancé. When Lawrence is attacked by the same creature, he realizes it is a wolfman, causing his bite to turn him into another wolfman once there is a full moon. After causing destruction, the people of London try and capture and kill Lawrence to stop his terror. This is a very well thought out plot, allowing good characters and drama to tie in with the intensity and drama. The plot with Lawrence and Gwen doesn't drag on or get too sappy. There is a perfect amount of Werewolf violence that is very scary and exciting. It can get a little too gory at times. The makeup is perhaps the most skillful aspect of "The Wolfman." The transformations scenes from human to beast is particularly amazing. The production design and visual effects are almost as good, taking us into an old, dark time period with haunting forests and castles. I would have liked it more if Christian Bale or Hugh Jackman played Lawrence, just cause they look the part more. Everyone else is perfectly cast. "The Wolfman" is a very entertaining thriller that has tributes to older horror films and is a mix between excitement and challenge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Given the mauling that this film received from many horror fans and critics, I'm not expecting my opinion to be all that popular, but here goes? I actually think that this remake is better than the 1941 Universal original. A lot better.For me, the Lon Chaney Jr. classic never really delivered the goods: a few atmospheric scenes in the woods aside, it lacked style, the performances were hammy, and worst of all, when the Wolf Man did show his hairy face (which wasn't much), he just wasn't all that terrifying. This modern take on the tale is visually stunning throughout, boasts an excellent cast, doesn't scrimp on wolfish action, and, most importantly, features lycanthropes that more than live up to their legendary horror status. When the moon is full, terror and carnage is guaranteed?As realised by make-up genius Rick Baker, the monster in this instance is truly impressive, a powerful, snarling, ravenous beast designed to strike fear into the heart of the viewer. There's no tippy-toeing around the forest for this chap; he leaps and bounds after his prey with the savagery I expect from such an accursed creature. When he attacks, victims are ripped to shreds, limbs are torn off, and guts eaten. Director Joe Johnston (a much under-rated film-maker, in my opinion) handles this action brilliantly, his 'wolfman' scenes exploding with energy and excitement.Johnston proves equally as adept with the film's less showy, more dramatic moments, but isn't beyond having a little fun at the same time despite the tragic nature of the tale: the inclusion of a fictionalised version of a real-life character in the form of Hugo Weaving's Detective Aberline shows a wry sense of humour, while the scene in which Lawrence Talbot transforms behind a smug psychiatrist as the man describes his patient's supposed delusional state exposes a wonderfully twisted comic streak.Lastly, for fans who demand bang for their buck, there is a cool chase scene in which the wolfman races over the rooftops of London and a superb finale featuring a lycanthrope smack-down inside a raging inferno, all of which utilises some stunning CGI. Quite what the naysayers are complaining about I really do not understand.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for briefly featuring one of my favourite actresses, Olga Fedori, who played Frieda Petrenko in Holby City and starred in excellent low budget Brit horror Mum &amp; Dad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An American Remake of the 1941 classic werewolf horror film of the same name, 'The Wolfman' merits itself a watch due to its stunning visuals &amp; the convincing performances it packs in. 'The Wolfman' Synopsis: Upon his return to his ancestral homeland, an American man is bitten, and subsequently cursed by, a werewolf.'The Wolfman', despite its pluses, needed a much better Screenplay. The film begins amazingly &amp; many sequences are sharply executed, but the last 40-minutes of the film don't deliver. The pace dips, the writing surrenders to clichés &amp; the culmination is a plain ordinary. A Stronger Screenplay was certainly needed! Visually, 'The Wolfman' enlightens. Each and Every Frame is beautifully captured, courtesy The Fantastic Cinematography. Joe Johnston's Direction is well-done. Make-Up is extra-ordinary. Editing is crisp.Performance-Wise: Benicio del Toro is perfect as The Wolfman. Sir Anthony Hopkins is despicable, he enacts the bad-guy, flawlessly. Emily Blunt is in terrific form. Hugo Weaving is adequate. On the whole, 'The Wolfman' has its share of pluses and minuses.</fullReview>

Wolfman is one of these movies, Dark and atmospheric, The Cinematography was excellent, The practical effects were refreshing and the CGI transformations were beautiful done. Particularly enjoyable were the performances by Hopkins, and Weaving who share very little screen time, but each deliver a haunting performance beautifully. If I have one complaint it was the amount of back to back jump scares. Thankfully the Director's cut breaks this up and adds much more character development to the story.

		<shortDescription>Has potential, but the wrong writers and director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Universal's 1941 classic horror film, THE WOLF MAN, saw Lon Chaney Jr. transformed into a hairy beast by the power of a gypsy curse. The film itself was a whole lot of fun; not, perhaps, a classic on the same level as the early FRANKENSTEIN, but nonetheless a hugely influential and entertaining movie for its time. Some 70-plus years later, the time was clearly ripe for a remake, so along came this new version.In some ways it's very much like the original: the look is almost exact, with plenty of attention paid to the spooky Gothic atmosphere with lots of dark woods filled with skeletal branches and crumbling piles located in the back of beyond. The storyline is similar, although of course it has to be made more complex for modern audiences: no simple gypsy curse here, instead a complicated back story involving family history and one or two vital plot twists.In other respects, THE WOLFMAN is a different beast entirely and one that pales in comparison to the simple and effective shocks of the original. Apparently Benicio del Toro took on the title role as something of a labour of love, but I wonder why he bothered as he's miscast in it. Instead of crafting a sympathetic creation driven to bestial crimes, you spend most of the movie wondering at how awkward and out of place he looks in comparison to the rest of the cast. Hell, Ralph Bates' mixed-up doctor in DOCTOR JEKYLL AND SISTER HYDE elicited a great deal more sympathy than del Toro here! The rest of the cast fare little better; Emily Blunt seems to be ageing badly and looks equally ill-at-ease in her role of the token love interest, who's as bland as she is irrelevant, and Anthony Hopkins is back to the kind of camp, overtly theatrical mannerisms that spoilt THE MARK OF ZORRO. Hugo Weaving and Art Malik are both given so little to do that you wonder why they bothered turning up at all.Still, THE WOLFMAN does have improved special effects over the original, if you're into that kind of thing; the CGI transformations are achieved very nicely, and account for the film's highlight, a set-piece experiment in which Wolfie is wheeled out in front of a load of medical professionals during a full moon. The gore quotient has also been ramped up considerably, making this feel like a full-blooded horror. In the end, though, the inanities of the script scupper this film's chances at real success. The need to introduce additional villains to show our hero in a good light instead of fully exploring his dark side is a cop out, and things descend to superhero-style farce come the slug-it-out climax. It's a shame, because in more subtle hands this could have been subdued and scary; in the hands of Joe Johnston, director of HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS, it becomes a kid's flick with extra gore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Teen Wolf is Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You've probably already seen this exact same story several times, right down to the horribly cliché ending. Not only does it offer nothing new, it makes the "Underworld" trilogy look like a masterpiece. Caught up in the vampire/werewolf craze, this film never should have been made. It is unoriginal, unentertaining, undeniably predictable, and just unfortunate. You keep expecting a twist that never comes. The unnecessary violence is straight from an 80's B-movie, and the action scenes have no "wow" factor at all. I literally felt bad for the great actors in this film. Anthony Hopkins and Benicio del Toro aren't bad in their roles, but when "Teen Wolf" is more entertaining, you're in trouble. 2 out of 5 action rating</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambitious remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The odds are that if you're reading this, you're an admirer of the 1940 original. If that's so, you're looking to see how it honors the classic. I think THE WOLFMAN succeeds admirably in that regard, plus it seems to me that most of the people who were associated with this wanted to do a little more than simply re-polish a story that they're aware most of their viewers have seen dozens of times. You know that story, Larry Talbot of the Talbot family of Lanwelly has returned to his ancestral village after the death of his older brother and finds himself overtaken by the regional curse of the werewolf. This remake has its tongue very firmly in cheek as Benicio Del Toro assumes the Lon Chaney Jr. role, but employs many of the mannerisms and the quiet threat we see in Oliver Reed in Hammer's THE CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF. Part of that film's sub story, the idea that the Talbot clan has been close kin to gypsies for generations finds its way into this film. Fans of the horror genre will see a number of Hammer pastiches in here that I think they'll enjoy.Anthony Hopkins is along for the ride as Sir John Talbot, and his own predatory traits are something he can barely keep under his skin, as you'll see several times during the movie. Other reviewers here have commented on the demented qualities of Van Helsing that Hopkins suggested in Coppola's Dracula, and the directors have given him room to flesh out John Talbot's character in this version of the Wolfman. It's a good idea, really. People familiar with the great Claude Raine's penchant for scene hogging can't help but notice the way Raines occasionally lapses into "Look at me, I am acting" mode in the original, especially when he's reciting the old "Even a man who is pure at heart---" etc doggerel for Larry in that scene with Lon Chaney Jr. Hopkins here at least is given some room to move Talbot's character away from the single dimension Raines was allowed to explore, and the place he takes it to looks like fun.The same can be said for Emily Blunt, who becomes more than an appendage to her father's antique shop and a decoration for the arms of Patrick Knowles and Larry Talbot in this film. Blunt's version of Gwen Conliffe is a woman who seems to have her own reasons for doing everything, so it is unsurprising she can find the strength to take care of business in the classic Universal horror style in this version.Hugo Weaving is also in this film as Inspector Frederick Abberline, late of London and the investigation into the Whitechapel murders. How's that for a liberty from the original. And Geraldine Chaplin gets to do at least one grisly walk on and has a couple of other interesting moments in the film as Maleva, Maria Ouspenskaya's character from the original film.There are a few "American Werewolf in London" moments in here for the fans of the lycanthrope on film, some lovely CGI imagery of the beast loping over the rooftops. Blood and gore abounds, and nowhere is this at its more over the top best then in the scenes where Talbot has been arrested and subjected to the torture of the early psychiatric practice of days gone by. All I'm going to tell you is that some folks get what they're asking for.So all told, THE WOLFMAN is a worthy romping remake. It's not a carbon copy of the original, nor should we want it to be, and in it's own sweet twisted way is a loving tribute to the evolution of cinematic werewolfery over the last seventy years. Try it on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually outstanding, but wearisome story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 2010 version of "The Wolfman" reminds me a lot of 1992's "Bram Stoker's Dracula." Both feature a classic monster, both take place in Great Britain during the Victorian era, both are stylistically similar, and both feature Anthony Hopkins in a major role.Each is visually striking but, story-wise, "Dracula" wins the prize, which isn't to say that "The Wolfman" isn't worth watching. Hopkins, Benicio Del Toro (in the title role) and Emily Blunt are all fine in their roles, it's just that somehow the story and characters aren't all that engrossing. Maybe it's because Hopkins plays a distant eccentric patriarch and Del Toro plays his brooding loner son who hides behind Shakespearean characters. It's hard to relate to them or like them. Emily Blunt is likable enough, but she's never sufficiently fleshed out and her deep love for a certain character seems a bit unlikely and forced.But, again, the film looks incredible and is worth viewing or owning for this reason alone. You get foggy moors, mysterious woods, gloomy estates, gypsy camps, dungeons and old London streets, all with werewolf attacks. Speaking of which, there's quite a bit of action and extreme gore interspersed throughout to keep things interesting.The DVD features both the theatrical and unrated Director's cut, the latter of which is close to 20 minutes longer, which is the version I viewed.GRADE: C+ or B- (although, visually, it's A+ all the way)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Look out! A Puerto Rican werewolf in London.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm still somewhat surprised that they did a remake of one of Universal's most iconic monsters: the Wolfman. Of course, with every remake, there are some twists made in it and this one has quite a few. So, let's journey into the howling night as I review this horror piece.Now, we all know the general plot of the Wolfman: Lawrence Talbot gets bitten by werewolf and now he will transform with every full moon and put lives in jeopardy. However, there's much more to it. It's also, surprisingly a psychological film, which was supposedly what Universal intended the original movie to be, making the audience guess if our protagonist is really a monster or just crazy. Here, he is a monster, but some psychological elements were added in. It's nice that they retain the classic look of the creature while giving him longer claws, sharper teeth, and a much more ferocious attitude. I was a little shocked of how gory this movie was, blood and guts all over the place.The cast was great. Benicio Del Toro as Lawrence and Emily Blunt as Gwen give off the tortured qualities of their characters pretty well. In fact, Benicio's performance is comparable to Lon Chaney Jr's (the original Wolfman). The actors who steal the show, however, are Anthony Hopkins (as Lawrence's father) and Hugo Weaving (as the inspector who hunts the beast). Anthony's character is of that who experienced tragedies in his life like losing his wife but is now in a state where he's not too bothered by a lot of the strange things going on. He does care for his family but you can't help but feel that there's something slightly off about him. Hugo Weaving is terrific, being the most sane of all the film's people, playing by the rules and willing to consider any option before taking action, which makes him both tough and amusing.Definitely one of my favorite werewolf movies and I suggest you see this one. Just be sure to bring a few silver bullets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware of the hairy Hulk!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be fair, the wolf man movies never have been amongst the strongest of monster movies to come out of the Universal studios, even though his character, or rather said Lawrence Talbot, always had been such an intriguing one. What I always loved about his character was that he was disgusted with himself and really, really didn't wanted to be the wolf man (or wolfman as this movie suddenly decides to call him) and was desperate to find a cure for his condition. This element is totally gone in this movie and all that Lawrence Talbot does this time is running from the police and trying to get even with his father. There is no real depth to his character, which makes him and this movie as a whole a quite bland one.But it's not really fair to judge this movie as a remake, since it in essence is a completely different movie than the original 1941 one. Not only the characters are totally different but also the story has about nothing in common with the Lon Chaney Jr. movie. No need to watch the original first, or expect a lot of cool references to the classic original. This is a totally different movie on its own, so I'm also judging it that way.The foremost thing that prevented me from really liking or enjoying this movie was its pacing. The pace seemed totally off and the movie didn't really ever had a good flow to it. Scene's don't really follow each other nice or naturally and the movie also seemed to have some difficulties to find the right balance between its drama, romance and horror, with its story and way of storytelling, by director Joe Johnston, who I have always liked as a director of entertainment actually. The movie is filled with far too many slow moments, in which there is lots of (uninteresting) talking. It could had worked if the characters had been fleshed out more a bit, I guess.It's a movie that also feels quite long, even though it's only just 2 hours long (if you're watching the directors cut, like I did, that is) but this can easily be explained. It's not simply due to its pacing but also really due to its story. It isn't until half way through the movie that the Benicio Del Toro finally first transforms into the wolfman. After that point the movie becomes a bit of a different one, so it's like you're watching 2 full length movies, played right after each other. The movie most likely went through numerous re-writes, just like this movie got passed through by different directors, who were involved at one point or another to this project. This foremost was Benicio Del Toro dream project. He always wanted to be the wolfman and he really pushed this movie to get done. You can tell he really committed himself to his role and he is not bad or miscast, as most people seem to think and say. I think the reason why people don't really like him in this movie is simply because his character isn't very well written, which really goes for all of the characters in this movie, who are all lacking in depth and a good back-story. I also really didn't liked how the Hugo Weaving character got played and presented as a villain, while all he was trying to do was to stop horrific killings from occurring and protect the many innocents from dying. There is nothing in this movie its story that is really justifying Del Toro being the 'good' guy and Anthony Hopkins and Hugo Weaving being the bad guys. You just never care enough for any of the characters to make you really root for anyone.It's a very dark looking movie and probably too dark. It seems like the right style and atmosphere for this movie but it doesn't really enhances the movie its classic horror aspects. It more seems to serve the purpose of masking the CGI effects. The movie is heavy on its computer effects and the one time its quite good and acceptable looking while at others it's far too fake. I still kind of liked all of the transformation sequences though.It's a movie that can get quite bloody and gory but for the fans of the genre there are simply far too little moments like this in the movie. You could say that it's lacking in its action and horror and I think that this is the foremost reason why lots of people were disappointed with watching this movie. I myself was also quite disappointed. I never expected this movie to be great but I at least expected to get some entertainment and enjoyment out of it and that it perhaps would take me back to the old days of the classic Universal horror monster movies. It however was instead a poorly told movie, with a weak script and characters, that is lacking with its pacing and horror as well.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite Gory, but clichéd plot, hackneyed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Give credit to filmmakers of "The Wolfman" for trying. They've made a very good production design, and have chosen some talented actors. Also, the make-up, creature scenes, and gore are all extreme. Too bad the story, dialog, and conflicts are subpar and clichéd over-the-top. Possibly the worst choice of developments (major spoilers) is to enlist Anthony Hopkins as an antagonist; here he is mostly unbelievable as a "let the creature roar" type attitude after supposedly killing his wife etc. The middle third of the movie recreating an a 120 year old London almost saves the movie by itself, but too bad it had to go back to trite storyline. The Wolfman is a good try for the genre, but not really good. It needed to stay away from bending it's own rules.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gory, Gruesome (Disappointing) Thrill-Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lawrence Talbot (Benecio Del Toro), an actor performing in London, returns home to face his estranged father (Anthony Hopkins) after he receives news that his brother is missing. These claims that are quickly amended when his brother is discovered dead, victim to a hideous, unnatural demise by an unknown creature. Xenophobic villagers first suspect that traveling Gypsies are responsible. The Gypsies, in fact, are the ones who really know what's going on: a ferocious beast, half-man, half-wolf, is on the loose, one who can only be destroyed by silver bullets fired by the one who truly loves him. Lawrence vows to investigate the truth behind the murder, with his brother's beautiful fiancée-in-mourning, Gwen (Emily Post), as an added incentive. After being attacked himself by his brother's killer, he survives and becomes heir to a dark curse of death and bloodshed. The highlight of the film is?what else??the CGI werewolves. There are two of them: Lawrence and his werewolf progenitor. The transformations themselves from man to animal are very smooth and impressive. Unfortunately, these killer beasts work best when very little is seen of them (more is left to the imagination that way). There's a werewolf showdown, which unfortunately is more reminiscent of two hairy ape-men fighting than wolves.The story itself begins with promise but descends into tediousness by the halfway mark: Lawrence becomes a werewolf; Lawrence and the heroine undergo the obligatory romance; Lawrence escapes into London and goes on a rip-and-shred rampage, etc. The cardboard-thin characters have very little depth, but are brought to life by some pretty impressive actors. Hugo Weaving's portrayal of investigating Inspector Abberline is topnotch, eerily reminiscent of his hypnotic performance as Agent Smith in THE MATRIX. Anthony Hopkins does what he does best (being evil and awesome), but unfortunately his two- dimensional wickedness contributes to the film's disappointment. Emily Post's portrayal of a fragile but stoic heroine is fairly solid, but nothing to write home about. The weakest link, sadly, is the lead himself. Benecio Del Toro delivers his lines in a wooden, bored sort of way, leaving the audience to speculate on a better actor for the role.Had the script perhaps focused on lycanthropy's implications in regards to mankind's dual nature, this could have been a powerful film. As it turns out, the aftermath of Lawrence's transformations is disappointing. Although Lawrence reviles the brutality of violence?or at least, the idea of it?the viewer is left with the impression that he is more inconvenienced by these killings than anything else (really?who likes waking up covered in blood?).The verdict: THE WOLFMAN is a gory, gruesome thrill-ride that boasts some really cool CGI monsters and characters that resemble cardboard cutouts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wolfman (2010, R)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wolfman" is a head rolling good time in this remake of the 1941 horror classic. It uses shadows effectively to give a feeling of the "beast within" looking out at us with haunting, glowing eyes. Set in 1891 England, the contrast between the stately courtesy of the period and the razor sharp claws of the werewolves works well. The atmosphere is dark and picturesque in the tradition of "Sleepy Hollow" or "The Nightmare Before Christmas", which makes it appropriate to have Danny Elfman (composer of all three) provide the original music.That said, it's difficult to take some of the graphic scenes seriously with so many shock cuts and blood splattered bodies filling the screen. At times it seems more like a vision for a Roman coliseum than for a silent audience expecting gripping horror. Should we get up and cheer with each kill? Joe Johnston ("Hidalgo," "October Sky"), the director, tried to modernize the film into a flashy, faster story, but the result is an uneven mix and not enough screen time for characters that could have given the film more flare, such as Anthony Hopkins and Hugo Weaving. The film also suffers from slower moments and unimportant plot points that serve as a speed bump after so many werewolf attacks.Anthony Hopkins is a strong point as Sir John Talbot, the resident werewolf. His son, Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro, "The Usual Suspects"), returns to Blackmoor after he gets word that his brother, Ben, is missing. Lawrence (Benicio Del Toro) doesn't react much to his father's calm and stoical treatment of Ben's death (he tells Lawrence about it heartlessly), but, of course, he hasn't been home much and doesn't like his father very much either.Lawrence sees Ben's stripped, skeletal body and wants to solve the mystery of the death for the benefit of Ben's fiancé, Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt), and his own curiosity. He visits a camp of gypsy's and has a cryptic conversation with Maleva (Geraldine Chaplin), who figures as the local expert in mysterious happenings. Some of the setup to the action is unclear, but a werewolf attacks the camp in almost a comical manner, but perhaps the scene was shot from the point of view of the superstitious locals, who see the gruesome attacks as some sort of evil curse.Lawrence gets brutally bit by the werewolf, becoming one of them. His father enjoys setting him loose in the full moon, almost as if he's training his son to be a werewolf by sending him out into the wild. Anthony Hopkins delights in the beastly form his life has taken. In the way the movie imagines them, werewolves are similar to "The Hulk". They unleash the beast within, the lawless "dog eat dog" or "kill or be killed" animal of nature. But they also inhabit ordinary people, as the beginning quote says: "even a man who is pure of heart ? may become a wolf." The movie questions whether we could draw a line between werewolf (as the beast within) and human (as the civil being that makes laws and has moral standards to protect its dignity). The unexplained part is Lawrence's frequent dreams of a young werewolf child. His father was originally bit by such a child during his field research into lycanthropy. Does becoming a werewolf pass along shared memories?In an excellent scene, Lawrence is captured and taken to an asylum (doctors think he's insane for claiming to be a werewolf), where a doctor brings him before an audience on the night of a full moon. He wants to prove to Lawrence and everyone in attendance (calm scholars and students from the looks of them) that Lawrence is mad and won't turn into a werewolf. Symptomatic of the film's problems, it briefly uses situational humor when the doctor doesn't notice Lawrence turning into a snarling beast behind him. It could actually have been held a little longer to build the tension and add detail in the scene. Here we start to see a bit of favoritism by the beast. He picks out his victims more than in earlier, random killings, which also helps to obscure the line between werewolf and human.The lead up to the ending is a bit tedious, but Anthony Hopkins has an excellent scene as he plays a piano with blood soaked fingers. Some of the best scenes are these that slowly build up to the bloody parts. One major problem with the action-slasher scenes was the lackluster special effects. Heads and arms pop off a bit too easy (to the point of comedy), and one of the transformations has a ring strangely glide off a finger. But the film is still enjoyable, especially for some of the supporting performances (Hopkins, Weaving) and visual style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine updating of a classic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am perplexed, after finally getting a chance to see The Wolfman, as to why its ratings are so mediocre. I was thoroughly engaged and entertained by it.This was a film I had wanted to see since I first heard of its production. The 1941 Lon Chaney Jr. classic was a marvelous film and an icon of the Universal horror days. I personally never warmed to the new-wave werewolves of The Howling and more recent films, where werewolves change forms at will, any time of the day or night. Yes, I know this concept is more in keeping with the ancient legends. Despite that, I was weaned on old-time Hollywood werewolves and that is how I like my lycanthropes. I was thrilled that the story was going to be retold with modern cinematic techniques, but staying true to the old Universal story line.I was certainly not disappointed! Director Joe Johnston and writers Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self weave a spine-tingly, creepy, very Gothic horror tale amidst the foggy, moonlit woods of rural England. Great care is taken to create the appropriate mood. It even opens with the awesome poem Siodnak created for the first movie, "Even a man who is pure in heart and says his prayers by night, may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms, and the autumn moon is bright." Of course the great Danny Elfman helps with his wonderful scores. Just over-the-top enough in certain spots, it perfectly builds the tension and helps tell the story.Walker and Self take a few deviations from Curt Siodnak's screenplay for the 1941 film. Here Sir John Tolbert (Anthony Hopkins) is also a werewolf, who tries to welcome his son Lawrence (Benicio Del Toro) into the fraternity. This makes for a memorable semi-climactic scene.Del Toro and Emily Blunt are outstanding in the lead roles. Interestingly, in several key shots, the Puerto Rican native Del Toro actually bears a resemblance to Chaney Jr. At least his eyes manage to take on the same haunted, hopeless look that Chaney's emitted. To me this is what makes the Hollywood werewolf special ? a decent man is trapped into the life of a beast, against his will, just as the poem says.Hopkins is great as Sir John, given a much meatier role than Claude Rains was in 1941. Nichalos Day, meanwhile, is excellent as Col. Montford of Scotland Yard. Johnston expertly uses establishing shots of Montford arriving on the scene to set up the building conflict between him and the Talbots. Geraldine Chaplin, by the way, actually bears a minimal resemblance to Maria Ouspenskaya as the elderly gypsy Maleva.There is just enough gore ? a tad more in the unrated version that was included on the DVD ? to make it a legitimate horror film and some fine special effects. Lawrence transforming into the beast while strapped down behind the brutal asylum head, Dr. Lloyd (Michael Cronin) who is lecturing esteemed colleagues on how he is curing Lawrence of his werewolf delusions is worth the price of the rental itself. Scenes of the wolf switching from running on two legs to scampering on four legs while pursuing or being pursued adds a nice electric charge to the film.Not having read other reviews, I am at a loss as to what many people disliked about it. I suspect that some in today's audience might have found the pace slow. To me it was ideal, as the haunted woods, ruined churches and ancient Talbot estate -- not to mention the characters -- were given time to grow on the viewer.I find the feel of the film perfect. Johnston's work actually makes me think of Tim Burton's wonderful Sleepy Hollow on several occasions. He sets up a similar community of worried, frightened locals, dreading the sun going down (and, in this case, the moon coming up), with a similarly creepy backdrop. The only difference is Johnston imbibes his film with much of Sleepy Hallow's panache, but very little of its tongue-in-cheek feel.If you like your werewolves traditional, a moderate amount of gore, a little doomed romance and fine Gothic atmosphere, you will love The Wolfman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lycanthropy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lycanthropy is 'in folklore, the magical ability to assume the form and characteristics of a wolf: it also describes a delusion that one has become or assumed the characteristics of a wolf or other animal'. What makes this remake of the original screenplay circa 1941 by Curt Siodmak is the apparent respect for the 'delusional' aspect of the subject matter. The setting for the film is Blackmoor England 1891 and the screen is filled with imagery so dark and dependent on candlelight that the underlying terror of the story is well set. The story is known to everyone: Sir John Talbot (Sir Anthony Hopkins in a mesmerizingly dissociative role) has a past that includes the loss of his wife by 'suicide' and the loss of his one son Lawrence (Benecio Del Toro, miscast here) to the land of America where he became an actor, never communicating with his family - the family now being solely his father and his brother Ben (Simon Merrels) along with Ben's affianced Gwen (Emily Blunt). While Lawrence is playing 'Hamlet' in London, Gwen comes to Lawrence's dressing room to seek his help in investigating the recent murder of Ben. Lawrence acquiesces and returns to the Blackmoor manor, much to the surprise of his strange father. As Lawrence begins his search he is attacked by a werewolf and thus, by definition, he becomes cursed and is destined to live out his days as an occult monster who breaks into the werewolf mode at the full moon. The story from there needs to be viewed instead of reviewed as what little story there is lies in the conclusion of this strange family. The cast is strong - Hopkins is his usual master of acting, Blunt manages to create a credible character with the little material given her, Hugo Weaving turns in probably the best performance as an Inspector with insight about lycanthropy, and even Geraldine Chaplin glows a bit as the gypsy Maleva. The cinematography by Shelly Johnson captures all the gory details of carnivorism and the stench of an insane asylum and Danny Elfman's musical score enhances the moods. THE WOLFMAN is not a great movie, but it is a good period piece and a reminder of the original film that started the now overabundance of film on werewolves and vampires. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad in Interesting Ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Joe Johnston, who usually has a considerable penchant for handling the demands of a special effects-driven movie, The Wolfman does indeed entrench itself solidly in period, with a beautiful production set in 1891. Gothic horror stories usually strike me as more savory when set in outmoded British country houses and populated with bleak wallflowers, particularly when the countryside includes clouded plateaus and a jagged waterfall. This is, ultimately, a folktale taking place before the onset of modern psychology, back when a man's destiny could be assured by genealogical infamy. The film's opening and closing shots are of the full moon, which is effective. One exterior presents maybe the most ideal of all English manor homes. Inside it is forsaken and dilapidated, resided in by the gloomy old Sir John Talbot and his loyal steward Singh. Gas was well known as a system of light, and actually electric lights were not unheard of, but Sir John makes do with fluttering candles carried from room to room, because they're better for throwing sinister shadows. In between all this, however, is an amateurish and feeble plot by normally very skillful and original screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker, who wrote Se7en. But his Wolfman script doesn't do anything but stand in place, swirling. So it attempts to sell energy it doesn't have with over-editing.Sir John's son Ben and his fiancée Emily Blunt were dwelling with Sir John until lately, when Ben was slaughtered in a frenzy. Gwen writes to Ben's years-alienated brother Lawrence, an American actor who is appearing in London in Hamlet and, hilariously, is clutching the skull when we first see him. Naturally, Lawrence shows up in a clouded, biting nightfall, and his voice parrots in the expansive forlorn castle before his father materializes from the dark. Some welcome. Del Toro makes Lawrence cheerless, troubled, afraid, condemned, but in a shocking drop-off from the talent that had reached its peak as Che Guevara. His father, Sir John, nevertheless, is played by the bearded Anthony Hopkins as a man sustaining better than you probably might expect. And he's very well-dressed, particularly for a man who lives predominantly in the dark.Almost exactly thirty years after An American Werewolf in London and The Howling, two much more creative and innovative movies, Rick Baker returns to design another wolf man. No argument that there are entire scenes done so efficiently in CGI that I wasn't even made aware of them. Johnston's previous films have been either G, PG, or PG-13, but here I was excited to see a film with that sort of comic-book spirit grow some real balls and shoot for the R rating purely on the basis of bloody, gory brutality. Nevertheless, when the werewolf rampages through the forest, he does so with too much haste. He would be more authentically fearful if he moved like a creature of the mammoth heft that's visually apparent. The werewolf moves so spryly here, almost like a cat, he basically wears a sandwich board: I'm animated! But maybe I'm wrong. I am not familiar with the physiology of wolf men. The werewolf has much less artificial testimonial than the vampire. How precisely does one transform from a man into a wolf? With special effects, of course. I get why he sheds his clothes when he explodes into a carnivorous hulk. What I don't get is how he always gets the same clothes back on and just with holes and rips in them. Does he backtrack through the murky timberland by moonlight, cleaning after himself?I normally love stuff like this. The blacker and more foreboding the better. Lawrence sees his brother's body, which appears to have been delicious. For the time being, down at the compulsory community ale house, the chatting of the residents revolve around a bizarre beast foraging in the parish. I imagine in the 19th century, a pub functioned as the evening news. The obligatory Danny Elfman music, which is indeed dark, moody and melodic, sneaks through the crevices. But all this movie ever adds up to is a $150 million metronome of predictable set-ups and stale pay-offs! It's new wine, but poured into a bottle so old it's moldy! The saving grace is that the mold is interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe the producers didn't expect much from the audience. This movie could be so much more than a visually entertaining candy movie. It could be a psychological thriller like ancient unsolved serial killers roaming around Germany during the dark age.A shame that the movie production company were too chicken to gamble on something outside of the box. Still kudos to the acting performances from all the actors and actresses - they made this movie entertaining despite predictable screenplay.Someone out there should do a ancient time serial killer movie already! Like Guy Richie's Sherlock Holmes (2010), think outside of the box and you'll have an instant classic that people appreciate it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Couple of Hours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the kids packed off to their grandparents, the wife and I turned up to the cinema to sit with 6 other couples to watch The Wolfman. As it was a weekend and only 3 days after its general UK release, we were left wondering if we'd missed some pretty bad reviews which had warded off other potential customers.As the film went on, two of the other couples got up and left.A dog of a film perhaps? Absolutely not and I am at a loss why those people left. It certainly wasn't the finest film I've ever seen, the love interest story was ham-fisted, the dialogue during these scenes awkward and the film didn't seem to "flow" with the pace erratic to such an extent that you almost got bored at times.Other than that, it was a different story. Benecio Del Toro played his role remarkably understated given more over-the-top acting styles of his peers in other Gothic horror remakes, he managed to develop the character and your sympathy for him well over the film. Sir Anthony Hopkins, who annoyed me originally by looking bored and aloof in his scenes, ultimately pulled it back and played his role as cold and icy as you would expect. Hugo Weaving with another fake accent added the only humour to the film and turned out yet another interesting and enthralling turn.The special effects were great and there was also enough blood and limbs flying to keep most gore-fest fans happy. I also liked the little homage to "An American Werewolf in London" (whether intended or not) of crashing trams and traffic in Leicester Square with the Victorian backdrop.Overall I enjoyed it and would recommend anyone who wants to lose themselves for a couple of hours without having to think too much to watch it.Oh, and one last point, the music doesn't half sound like the sound track to Coppola's Dracula.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, Bad Soundtrack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wolfman is an excellent remake of the 1941 classic. It is a moody, dark period piece with a psychological edge that explores a troubled father-son relationship. The soundtrack to this film, however, is HORRIBLE and really detracts from the movie. I was a fan of the original and like many out there, I feared Hollywood might destroy this remake as they did when they remade Dracula. They didn't. This remake was done as it should have been, with enough new material (not to mention effects) to make retelling the Talbot story worth while, and enough deference to the original Wolfman to please long time monster movie fans like me. I'm sure this version will not please everyone out there, but those who enjoy a horror movie that is more than just an excuse for cheap shocks and gore should like this film. I had heard that this version was particular bloody and did not find this to be the case. Of course, considering the subject matter, there are bloody scenes, even the odd decapitation, but this never rises to the level of the B-movie splatter parties, and the gore presented in this film always serves the story and isn't gratuitous in that respect. I found the pacing to be good and was happy to see the film take the time to develop a story. If you are only interested in a weak plot that jumps directly into a kill fest, as many slasher movies do, this film probably isn't for you. If you want to see a grown up monster movie, you should love The Wolfman. The only complaint I have with the film (I've seen it twice now) is the soundtrack. The musical accompaniment is horrible. I suspect they were trying for operatic but the music is just annoying. Too often I found myself straining to hear the movie through the background music, which was too loud and too ever present. It also had the effect of telegraphing much of the horror. So many scenes would have been much more frightening if they had no score playing in the background. I really hope they release the DVD with the option to turn the music off completely--it really spoils an otherwise outstanding film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Fun, But Marred by a Badly-Paced First Act.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wolfman" is a remake of the 1941 Universal monster movie; this remake, which has Benicio del Toro as Lawrence Talbot, holds the tradition of classic creature features with an updated use of opportunity and technology that 1941 didn't offer. Del Toro stars as our protagonist, Lawrence, an England-born American playwright and actor who returns to his decrepit family manor in the late 1800s after his brother, Ben, disappears and is found murdered. His father, Sir John Talbot (played by Anthony Hopkins), lurks around the dark manor by himself, while the townspeople whisper of a ravaging beast and/or madman who may be responsible for Ben's demise and countless others. Soon enough, Lawrence has an encounter with the wild beast, which nearly mortally wounds him. In the process, he contracts a curse which turns him from man to beast by the light of a full moon. With the compassion and help provided by Ben's widow, Gwen (played by Emily Blunt), Lawrence attempts to halt the curse before he wreaks unwilling havoc on innocent people.When you go into a film like this, you have to suspend your disbelief and go with the story. It's a dark fairy tale of sorts, laced with curses and lycanthropy that derives from ancient folklore - of course it's not real... but what if it was? That aside, this is a pretty entertaining film, aside from some faults. Joe Johsnton, who brought us action-fare such as "Jumanji" and "Jurassic Park III", directs the film, and provides some good things and some bad things. The film succeeds in thrilling the audience, though I'd be troubled to call it flat-out scary; thrilling is a better word. The CGI-transformation effects are surprisingly convincing, and not too rambunctious (though the fiery finale at the end of the film was ALMOST too much for my tastes). The atmosphere is well-established as well, with the endless Gothic architecture, foggy hollows, and dead leaves; classic set-dressings, ala Tim Burton's "Sleepy Hollow" and other films of the sort. But it's nicely done, and it works.Now, the single most problem this film suffers from is pacing. The pacing in the first act of the film is, dare I say it: awful. I felt like I was watching an action movie with werewolves, not a werewolf movie with action; and it's not even because there was too much action going on, no - it was because things were simply happening too fast. There was no establishment of characters to speak of, and everything felt amped-up for no reason. The first thirty-forty minutes of the film seemed like a stream of badly-transitioned scenes that are overplayed with dramatic music to make things tense; the problem with this is that we are never given any downtime to begin with. There are no silences, no build-ups; it's just bam, bam, bam- one scene after another. That's fine for a finale when the action is rising, but for an introduction/exposition? That's just messy.Aside from that, I can't complain too much about any other facets of the film. The acting is wonderful. I expected good performances from Del Toro and Hopkins (and they are both very good), but Emily Blunt is the one who shines in this; she's certainly proved herself enough as a serious actress, and she does great work, even as a damsel-in-distress clad in lovely Victorian gowns and Edwardian hats. Hugo Weaving also has a large part as a detective, and he's great as well. The film's finale is good, even if the fiery fight is a bit too "action movie" for my tastes. The final scene at the waterfall, though, is very well-played. As for the best wolf scene, I'd definitely have to say that the asylum observatory scene is the very best, along with the subsequent reign of terror that Benicio brings throughout downtown London. Fun stuff, though I have to say, the gypsies were a bit under-used.Overall, "The Wolfman" justifies itself enough as a solid remake of a classic monster movie. Creature features aren't really my thing, but I enjoyed this one because of its setting and acting. It's very well-photographed and has enough thrills and monster violence to please horror fans, and enough action to keep adrenaline junkies awake. However, the film's fatal flaw is its initial pacing structure, which brings things down a bit. As it progresses, this improves, but the first forty minutes are poorly laced together. Even still, I can't say it wasn't fun. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a Man that's a Wolf</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of 1941's Wolf Man, Wolf, Ginger Snaps films and (my #1 all time pick) The Howling (ORIGINAL only) I am very, very sad there's only a handful of good werewolf movies out there.I know it's an unpopular opinion, and that never bothers me, but I either strongly disliked or hated the following werewolf attempts: any/all of the Howling sequels, the Underworld films, Cursed, Van Helsing, both An American Werewolf in London and Paris, Silver Bullet, and Bad Moon, just to name a few. Also, I cannot stand to see a human morphing into a dog (they call it a wolf, I say dog because it looks like it and it's absolutely no "Wolf-MAN") with one exception: Wolf. Otherwise, that's not scary to me and it doesn't look like a man that turned into a wolf ? it just looks like a nature show. Since the great majority of the so-called "werewolf" movies, Twilight: New Moon, Wolfen, An American Werewolf in London, etc, has a man turning into a dog, I simply look elsewhere. And finally, CGI has NOT been a blessing for one of my favorite movie monsters. Underworld not only did it almost 100% CGI, they decided, rightfully so, that it still looked fake. So what did they do? Sped up the action so fast, that you have barely 3 seconds in the entire movie to see any sort of werewolf. When you get "privileged" with those 3 seconds, you're disappointed in how fake and funny they look. On the flipside, Van Helsing also used CGI but slowed it down. Unfortunately for them, it was so hilariously bad looking, it seemed like everyone was afraid of a big teddy bear.So, it was refreshing to see Hollywood get back on track with an actual WOLF-MAN in 2010's latest remake of Wolf Man. I'm sure they used CGI, but it looks more like to me like they simply did old-school make up (and in my opinion the ONLY way to do this kind of creature. Sorry CGI buffs and people in love with the blue people of Avatar. Cameron might think this is the future, but I feel strongly CGI is beginning of the end.) While in some scenes, the werewolf is fast and vicious, in most he's (or they're) just standing there. Finally, we get to see a real-looking werewolf.In addition, the sets, the cinematography, the feel, the look of the late 19th Century England was beautiful. At first, I was opposed to making this film as a period piece, but the end result made it more creepy and more of a genuine remake of the 1941 classic vs. just another "modern" film.That all said, the rest of the movie was, well, just okay. There were far too many attempts at frights, most of which were so far in advance set up, you just sat and waited for them. A great majority didn't work, though admittedly one or two did make me jump. But that resulted in approximately 1-2% of the entire movie. This movie should frighten probably anyone who gets scared at simple stuff, like Paranormal Activity or any of the 1930-1940s original monster movies. Or any young kids.This brings me to another point: this is NOT for kids. Or even most teens. It might have been suitable for even younger teens, but they poured on the gore. This is NOT your grandfather's wolf-man. This is the Saw-Gen-Wolfman. Now, I didn't really have a problem at all with this. At least they had the balls enough to make an adult version of the classic, vs. making the idiotic PG-13 cut to make more money at the box office.Lawrence Talbot returns from USA to England when the search for his missing brother is just winding down. It turns out the entire town not only believed they're cursed with a man-beast on the loose, but fear that after a soon-to-be attack on a gypsy village and a bite on Talbot's neck, he'll be stalking/killing them too.Keeping in tradition, he can only change during a full moon, and the townie's attempts to thwart another series of murders by capturing/killing Talbot are moot as father Talbot protects his remaining child. There's some mystery on the other wolf-man on the loose and that's seen a mile away. When that's finally revealed, the scenes lead up to the eventual battle of the beasts.Throw in a fantastic London transformation scene and rooftop chase and a so-called love story from Talbot's sister-in-law and you have the entire movie.What worked: Great sets and feel. Wonderful transformation scenes. Great viewings of the werewolves. Old school techniques used right.What didn't work, unfortunately, is a longer list starting with: bad to mediocre acting. Both Hopkins and Del Toro all but looked bored and never before had I seen a tremendously bland job by either great actor. (Weaving just played/copied his "Agent Smith" role from Matrix.) Since they kept to "the full moon" predicament, they limited the number of wolf-man changes. The problem arises with believability in time frames, i.e. he's running from London back home and when he shows up, another full month had passed. Really? Also, predictable scenes, dialogue and twists. A "love" story that fell flat and was completely unconvincing. It was a tad bit slow at times. It suffered a somewhat confusing script when it could've been more straightforward. In addition, the dialogue was poor, bland and not one line stood out.This movie is for die-hard werewolf fans only. It has just enough morphing scenes and full-on wolf-man shots to keep me interested, though I would've preferred at least one more scene. I'm still awarding it 3/5 stars with strong reservations. It's not a horrible movie and it did a great job of giving you that 1940s feel all over again, aside from the gore. Worth a shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blood soaked gorefest, The Wolfman rises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that the general consensus is that the 2010 remake of The Wolfman was overall not successful. The story is not revolutionary, the entire werewolf concept is a bit overused with the Twilight films, Underworld and so on. The performances are not brilliant and even the best of the cast is a little overdone. But to me The Wolfman was flat out entertaining and that is really what matters. Everything can be sub par but if it entertains it has succeeded as a film. What shocked me at the same time as impressed me is that The Wolfman is absolutely blood soaked gory. Scenes of death and werewolf attacks are downright shocking and brutal and even overdone making them almost amusing but still shocking. I'm not sure I would still include The Wolfman as a horror film and perhaps classify more under the monster movie category but the story is interesting enough to keep the film moving. Regardless its not a movie for the faint of heart given the gory death scenes. Still as many reviewers said even if you went in with minimal expectations, somehow you expected more.I am not, nor have I ever been, a Benicio Del Toro fan. I don't dislike him but at the same time I find his very presence on screen very, very dull. It could have something to do with his odd appearance although some consider this appealing but he just seems to awkward. It was much more fun to see him as The Wolfman. Anthony Hopkins is an obvious legend and it was an absolute pleasure to see him in the role as Del Toro's father. He had some really great moments in the film and his turn as The Wolfman is really well done although that probably has little to nothing to do with Hopkins. Somehow Hopkins really comes across as incredibly over acted in his role. Perhaps next to Del Toro's borefest Hopkins just look over excited but his performance a little much. The chemistry between them is decent but not palpable. Lovely Emily Blunt is solid as the widowed wife of Del Toro's brother. Blunt's performance is somewhere in the middle of Del Toro's boredom and Hopkins being a little over the top but the balance is nice. The three of them carry the film and despite some stumbling they do carry it decently. Despite my hesitation about Del Toro and Hopkins mostly.Director Joe Johnston is no stranger to great loved films including one of my personal gems Hidalgo, and classics like Honey I Shrunk The Kids. Now neither of these are comparable to The Wolfman but the idea is that he can tell a great story. He knows how to have fun and worked on some of the greatest cult favorites of the last three decades in various capacities. I think The Wolfman is a different style for Johnston but it also feels perhaps a little rushed. Despite its shortcomings mentioned throughout the film is entertaining. Don't avoid the film, instead enjoy it for what it is...a bloody monster flick. 8/10</fullReview>

I found the old version to be boring (never been a fan of old movies the picture quality is horrible and effects are awful). This version is very exciting bringing 19th century charm to the big screen and building suspense at just the right moments throughout the film. This movie is a must see that will not leave you disappointed if you enjoy excitement with quite a bit of gore. The landscape is excellent and the fog and full moon add quite a bit of suspense themselves. The acting was very good and characters were well played. I don't see how the old version of this movie has gotten higher ratings, because it certainly does not deliver the suspense and quality of this newer film. The effects are amazing and this movie is a must see</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wolfman has plenty of bite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the things I loved about The Wolfman and ultimately made me decide to give a seven out of ten instead of six is that the suspense and tension throughout particularly with the music was fantastic. Director Joe Johnston who previously directed Jurassic Park III knows how creates films with pace to keep the audience interesting as there are some great action set pieces. Furthermore it was creepy and there were some generally scary moments. And the visuals were gorgeous to look at. Johnston has captured the tone and essence of 1800s England perfectly with the buildings and costumes.What unfortunately let this film down was a amateurish script bordering on bad, a predictable story and mostly bad acting. Benicio Del Toro wasn't at all convincing in the lead and looked out of place whilst Emily Blunt who looked gorgeous and tried hard to provide the love interest. I just couldn't feel it and as a result you fail to care about the characters. Hopkins and Weaving though give more than satisfactory performances. So even though there are things wrong with this movie. The positive outweighs the negative. Worth a trip to the cinema to see this as it's one movie with plenty of bite.</fullReview>

The transformation has to be one of the best newest werewolf effects in a long time. Lawrence turns into a monster not a fake cgi large wolf. Some people complain the plot is not original but you have to remember this is based on the original classic which didn't have deep plots either, just a great scare with great acting as this remake has done.The acting was well done too. The only flaws for me is the cgi bear and deer (although their not badly done) and I only wish the movie was longer.I highly recommend fans of the original to see it and or buy the DVD when it's released.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very enjoyable horror movie starring Anthony Hopkins and Emily Blunt but far from a classic or a cult movie operating from a very poor story line.There is a touch of 'Hound of the Baskervilles' about the movie with the era and the old fashioned cliques for the horror. An American werewolf in London springs to mind but perhaps more Hulk than Werewolf.The gypsy woman Malleva clearly had a major part to play in the movie but we only noticed her at the beginning and the end.there is indeed some wonderful cinematography and great conflict scenes and the movie maintains interest throughout.The roles of Ben Lawrence and the Emily Blunt character I feel were undemanding and the dialogue between Hopkins and Del Toro was at times more like a piece of stage Theatre than something for the big screen.Well worth watching but I agree that if you are looking for something like 'Twilight', forget it with this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you like watching bloody horror movies or remakes to oldie movies? Well this movie just may be good for you if you like that kind of stuff! Based off the remake of the 1941 classic of the old version and the same name, the 2010 recent one of The Wolfman shows off it's humorous dark side.It begins when a man named Lawrence played by Benicio Del Toro is looking for some answers after his brother has been killed, strangely by some half man/half beast like creature, but as he tries to keep on looking for his search, he gets bitten by a wolf when later on in the story becomes a werewolf at night when the full moon is up high.I've never seen the old version for this movie, but the new one will take your breath away and make you jump from the edge of your seat! The cast members in this movie are very good, especially Anthony Hopkins who plays Lawrence's father in the movie. Before I saw the movie, I kinda had mixed feelings if I wanted to see it or not, and I didn't know that from my experience if Benicio was right for the role or not, but now I change my mind after I watch it today.The transformation of watching him changing into a werewolf is extremely real original, more advance than what you see in the oldie kinds and you'll never want to leave this film once you get your eyes glue to the picture.It may be the best remake you've ever seen since King Kong! 7 out of a 10 makes it super great and close to coolness!</fullReview>

Bloody good (for the most part) remake of the 1941 Lon Chaney, Jr. /Universal Pictures classic about to-the-manor-born Lawrence Talbot (Del Toro, decidedly vulpine to boot and producer of this pet project/labour of love ? and it shows!), whose return to his home to search for his missing brother winds up the victim of his sibling's killer ? a werewolf - which in turn passes the lurid lycanthropic curse onto him. Fiercely interpreted by director Joe Johnston with gangbusters production design by Rick Heinrichs, gorgeously shot cinematography by Shelly Johnson, Danny Elfman's eerie score, and the true star of the film ?

		<shortDescription>Extended Cut: Proving in fact that The Wolfman is no monstrosity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wolfman is directed by Joe Johnston and adapted to screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self from Curt Siodmak's original 1941 screenplay. It stars Benicio del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt and Hugo Weaving. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and Shelly Johnson is the cinematographer. Plot is set in 1891 and finds Toro as Lawrence Talbot, who upon learning of his brother's grizzly murder, returns to his estranged father's estate in Blackmoor to investigate. Upon arriving he forms an instant bond with his dead sibling's fiancée, Gwen (Blunt), but soon Lawrence finds himself mired in a world of lycanthropy and family secrets.It had a much publicised troubled production, with a director switch, numerous release date changes and enforced cuts to the running time, sitting atop of this particular iceberg. With that it mind, film is arguably better than it had any right to be. What is now readily available is an extended cut of the film where some 17 minutes of footage have been put back into the story. Footage cut originally to foolishly speed up the moment when the first transformation from man to wolfman arrives. Is the extended cut a far better movie than the trimmed theatrical version? The answer is resounding yes it is. It still contains flaws, but now the narrative is stronger and crucially by waiting much longer for the first "big change scene", tension and anticipation now exist where previously it didn't. In spite of some modern day advancements for this 21st Century wolfman-excessive speed for the wolf, creature smack down finale-Johnston's movie is very faithful and respectful of the 1941 original. Which is perhaps not surprising since the weight of Universal is backing this remake of one of their original classic monsters from the 30's and 40's. But it's nice to see that a remake keeps the things that made the original so beloved. Gothic texture is rich, none more so than with the mist/smog shrouded village, while the tortured sadness that permeated Lon Chaney's take on Larry Talbot back in 1941, is perfectly essayed by del Toro this time around. While the creature design itself cleaves close to the original, with Rick Baker and Dave Elsey picking up the Academy Award for Best Makeup for their excellent efforts. Fans of shred and gore are also well served here, with Johnston (The Rocketeer/Jumanji) showing a keen eye for action construction. An attack at a Gypsy camp and a bloody rampage through a bus are the stand outs, while an asylum sequence is also not to be sniffed at. Chuck in the murder mystery element, and the intriguing father and son axis, and it's a film that has more to it than merely being a CGI popcorn piece. Even Elfman's score fits neatly into the period setting. Problem wise it comes down to Blunt and Weaving being under used, and Hopkins veering dangerously close to over hamming the omelette, yet all remain strong in characterisations. Toro, though, is not, as some have suggested, miscast. Already lupine like before transformation, he plays it perfectly troubled and brooding like. Talbot has inner demons and unanswered questions in his past, a past he has tried to shred but finds he now must confront those demons. The onset of lycanthropy serving, one feels, as a metaphor for his personal torment finally being unleashed. Toro nails it with an excellent, subdued, portrayal; though choice of hair style leaves much to be desired. Worth a mention as well is Shelly Johnson's photography, where nice atmospheric visuals complement the tone and period flavour of the piece. More homage than outright horror, but with a little something for everyone interested in Horror/Gothic/Mystery type movies, The Wolfman in extended form is an enjoyable enough experience. 7/10</fullReview>

Having seen it three times now, I can tell you that any criticisms are undeserved. This film is a serious monster masterpiece. The settings and production design are top notch, as is the incredible updated Wolfman makeup by master Rick Baker. The cast all do an admirable job of maintaining the feel of a classic horror film throughout. Benicio Del Toro is exceptional as Lawrence Talbot, the doomed Wolfman, and at times seems to be channeling Lon Chaney Jr. through his performance. It really is uncanny. Anthony Hopkins and Hugo Weaving make for interesting characters who each move the story along in their own inimitable way, and Emily Blunt is wonderfully cast as the perplexed Gwen Conliffe. I found Joe Johnston's directorial style to be exhilarating. He doesn't waste time going over old territory we're already familiar with, and instead moves the story along with such force that you feel helplessly caught up in this tragic chain of events, just like the participants. Every major event in the film coincides with a full moon, with scarcely any time in between. This further amplifies the feeling of dread, as the viewer is never given a chance to "relax" during the 28 days until the next appearance of the beast. The month flies by, as I'm sure it would for the afflicted werewolf. Some really nice nods to the monster movies of old include terrified villagers scrambling to bolt their doors and windows as the Wolfman's hideous howl fills the night, and the creaky, fog-shrouded forest of Blackmoor, it's trees black and twisted under the silvery light of the full moon. Topping all this off is an exceptionally creepy score by Danny Elfman, with a distinct European and Gypsy flavor. This is a great movie, full of scares, and a fitting tribute to those Universal masterpieces of the 1930's and 40's. So what are you waiting for? Dim the lights, grab some popcorn, and if it's a full moon...well, you might want to bring along that silver-handled cane...just in case!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a factory werewolf movie. It's so much better than that.By far the greatest things were the technical achievements in the movie (for example the cinematography, costumes, art direction, and makeup effects) Benicio Del Toro is tragic as the iconic monster and Anthony Hopkins is especially creepyI enjoyed it more the second time I saw it because I realized it is an homage to the classic "B" horror films of the 30's and 40's. It does not try to be a reboot in any way and that is one of it's strengthsThe extended cut is even more superior to the theatrical version. There are more scenes of dialogue then originally...It is obvious that the edits of only about seventeen minutes have a large difference on the overall feel of the film and the way characters interact...The cuts were a bad idea and I believe the studio should have left the extra footage thereTheatrical Cut 7/10 Extended Cut 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I submit my review, let me say that I read many reviews before going to see this movie. That being said, if you are expecting an epic movie experience, rent Gone With The Wind, etc... However, if you would like to see a decent remake of a 1941 classic, and judge it on entertainment value only, Wolfman is a movie you will enjoy. Without spoiling the movie for you, I will keep my critique simple. The storyline is simple, as was the original. Get bit by a Werewolf, and you turn into a Werewolf. The cinematic 'feel' of the movie is excellent. You get the feeling that you are back in England (circa 1891) The scenery is captivating and yet eerie at the same time. The special effects are very good and believable. Those who have picked apart some of the CGI scenes are getting a little too picky. This movie is very entertaining and provides quite a few thrills along the way. My only negative criticism would be that the beginning is somewhat slow in developing and the ending is predictable. There is a fair amount of gore, so parents be advised that you should take caution before attempting to sneak in underage children, just to avoid hiring a babysitter. Other than that, it is a movie well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wolfman (2010) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A reworking of the 1941 horror classic, about a young man who returns home after his brother's death, encounters a werewolf, and becomes infected by its bite with the curse which causes him to transform into a man-beast during the cycle of the full moon. I felt this was a fairly good horror film in its own different way ... and I'd easily consider it the best of all those "modernized werewolf movies" of the last 30 years. This one blows the overrated "An American Werewolf In London" and "The Howling" comedies out of the woods. It's also miles ahead of Jack Nicholson's pedestrian "Wolf".First, I loved the Victorian atmosphere and the cast. I thought Del Toro, Hopkins, and Blunt were top-notch; ditto for the other supporting characters. The Wolfman makeup (by monster movie fan Rick Baker) is superb -- he is fierce and deadly, and SCARY... I jumped a few times in my seat, and that's not something that happens very often with me and new horror movies. I appreciated that the subject matter was handled seriously and straight - no laughs. I liked how there were elements of both Universal and Hammer in there, sort of like the way the Hammer MUMMY managed to include elements of all the Universal Kharis films. I was able to feel some sympathy for Lawrence Talbot even though he was portrayed as a rather gloomy soul right from the get-go ... when we see how he's mistreated by a mental hospital, and how his father feels about him as the movie advances. I felt the bond between Larry and Gwen Conliffe, who becomes his heartbroken love interest, was pretty strong. I thought the gore effects delivered, so there's also that " '80s element " tossed in as well for that particular audience.Is it a PERFECT movie? No. A GREAT film? No way. But it delivers the goods for horror movie lovers, and I think that's what we here care about and why so many of us seem to like it. I was relieved that, while there is noticeable and needless CGI in places, it did not get overused to the point where it ruined the movie (as was the case with the 1999 Sommers MUMMY). I didn't need the werewolf galloping on all fours, but it didn't go overboard in that feature and at times it even worked. I also thought there seemed to be some editing questions here and there -- as if sometimes we jumped to something else and missed some key information (Gwen going to her antiques shoppe, seemingly out of nowhere and with no explanation of where it was or that it even existed?). Maybe I missed something there. At first I was a bit brought down by a "reimagining of Sir John" angle and I thought it hurt the movie ... but I was able to turn it around and by the time the reality sank in, it started to work for me as part of the story. I really didn't like the "set up" ending; that really got in the way and just was not required.So .... overall, a very pleasant surprise, and a remake that can stand alongside the 1941 classic (which in itself was flawed and not perfect) in its own right. I personally can't see why it's getting such so-so reviews from mainstream critics. It's a horror movie, for cryin' out loud - and an effective one at that. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's not to like about enigmatic Benicio del Toro, geared up as a 19th century nobleman, going berserk? Hugo Weaving, as hard-headed Scotland Yard detective Frederick Abberline, makes a deserving adversary. Even Anthony Hopkins, as the mother hen, didn't bother me as much as he usually does. The plot itself is very by the book, but it feels smooth and stylish all the way to the (entirely predictable) ending. Costumes and sets are attractions in themselves, but that doesn't come as a surprise if you know that production designer Rick Heinrichs also worked on "The Big Lebowski", "Sleepy Hollow", and "Pirates of the Caribbean". Guest appearance by Geraldine Chaplin as a gypsy witch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just returned home from seeing it and I was blown away by every piece of it. From the amazing transformation scenes and special effects to the flawless acting from Benicio Del Toro's tragic character to Anthony Hopkin's cold heartless antagonist role not to mention Emily Blunt and Hugo Weaving who did an amazing job as well.The film is set in a beautifully crafted and well done Victorian Age and tells the story of Lawrence Talbot (Del Toro) who returns to Blackmoor to search for the person or thing that slaughtered his brother as seen in the intro. His father (Hopkins) seems like a ghost and has no emotion for the dead brother and mother (who died years ago) but that is what you love about his character. Suddenly, while searching for answers, Talbot is bitten and the tragic adventure begins.Bottom Line: Do not listen to critics and see this movie you will not regret it and be glad you did</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blood and guts Gothic horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this in the cinema yesterday and was very pleased with what I saw. I'm not sure that I've seen many other wolf-man films but I am familiar with the concept and character and this film certainly goes town with the idea. The first thing that struck me was how good the film looked. It contains quite typical Gothic settings (moors, mansions) but they look massive and detailed, especially on the big screen. And the effects are brilliant too, especially the transformation of man to the wolf. The subsequent killings are brutal and bloody, with the surrounding action face-paced and heart pumping (the chase through London is a definite stand-out). The performances are good, particularly Bencio Del Toro and Antony Hopkins. Del Toro has a great presence and Gothic melancholy and Hopkins brings his usual gravitas to the proceedings. Overall this is a very stylish, powerful and entertaining horror. Recommended (almost certainly best viewed on the big screen).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie the plot was moving, all of the actors did an amazing job. The Victorian setting was beautiful Emily Blunt is always best when dressed in that time period for some reason. Del Toro and Hopkins make a good father son duo, both actors brought life to their characters. In was a very intense film for me personally I've never had my heart skip a beat so many times in the first 5 minutes of a film. I would recommend this to anyone who loves a horror flick with a good plot and yes lots of gore. :) I hope they make a sequel. P.S. I actually wanted to cry at the end, never thought I'd get that reaction from a horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great, but not quite a disaster either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake of The Wolfman does not resonate the way the original 1941 film does. I even found myself thinking back to scenes from that version while watching this ultimately disappointing revision. In a sense, it's inaccurate to say I was disappointed because I really wasn't expecting much. Even before I read the mostly dismissive reviews, the film's history had marked it as a misfire. In addition to several changes in directors, the film was scheduled for release in spring 2009, then rescheduled several times before finally opening this weekend. But though this is no classic, or even a movie that's likely to linger in the mind for more than a minute after the credits roll, it's hardly a disaster. It certainly helps to have a fondness for the Universal horror classics from the '30s and '40s, even though this film has more in common with the lesser films from that period. It's more on a par with House of Frankenstein or The Mummy's Ghost than with Dracula, Bride of Frankenstein, or The Black Cat. On the plus side, the sets are impressive, and the effects are effective, but not surprisingly, the emphasis is on gore more than atmosphere. It lacks the haunting power of the original which was simpler, less pretentious, and superior despite special effects that were limited to fog and Jack Pierce's makeup for Lon Chaney, Jr. (Universal dropped the "Jr" in the official credits.)Blood and guts are very prominent in this full color remake which draws on but wildly diverts from Curt Siodmak's 1941 screenplay, and also pays slight homage to Hammer's Curse of the Werewolf with Oliver Reed. As is typical of contemporary horror films (and those based on comic book characters), everything is overdone, including the story which presents us with two werewolves. The climax is a battle between the two snarling creatures that reminded me of the fight between the two beasts in the Edward Norton version of The Incredible Hulk. The best scene is one in an asylum where Larry Talbot, believed to be insane, is gagged and bound in a roomful of doctors while a full moon is on the rise outside. Their theories about Talbot's mental state are soon ripped to bloody shreds.Benicio Del Toro is fine as Talbot, Emily Blunt is lovely as his late brother's fiancée, and Anthony Hopkins is okay, but he's on hand to lend the film his stature more than his talent. Rick Baker's makeup is effective, and Danny Elfman's score is okay, but not as memorable as Frank Skinner's simpler, yet spookier, score for the original. The Wolfman is far from great, and it leaves no cliché untouched, but it delivers enough of the ingredients you'd expect from a werewolf movie to earn a passing grade. Brian W. Fairbanks</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I began reading the movie reviews of this film, I began to become afraid that I would not enjoy the film. Then with in the opening moments of the film I quickly knew I would love it and it did not disappoint. Rick Baker created what was possibly (In my opinion) the best looking and most realistic Werewolf to hit the big screen. I kept hearing everyone talk about how the film didn't build up the characters the way they should have and that it was just a mess but I beg to differ. While the character build up was far from superb it was still enough to make an impact. The special effects, make up and gore were simply superb in this film. The acting was excellent, particularly Anthony Hopkins portrayal as the estranged father. He portrayed no remorse or sympathy for anyone, not even himself. Emily Blunt gave a solid performance as did Benicio Del Toro who seems to never disappoint in a film. I will definitely be going to the theatre to see this again, and although it was not perfect, it was enough to make me fall in love with this film forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wolfman a Howler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Way back in 1941, George Waggner created a horror staple in The Wolf Man. We haven't all seen it, but it's regarded as one of the very first horror masterpieces. Fast forward to 2010, the decade of gritty reboots. Joe Johnston has created a laugher in The Wolfman. The story revolves around Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro, Snatch) a renowned Shakespearean actor come home to England from America after the mysterious and gruesome death of his brother Ben. His father, Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins, Silence of the Lambs), seems oddly unaffected by his son's horrific death. Ben's fiancé, Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt, The Devil Wears Prada), tries to leave the Talbot's manor in an attempt to escape the same terrible fate as her fiancé, but is inevitably dragged back because... of something. I don't know.Let's start with the good. Del Toro and Hopkins are fantastic as always. They capture their characters in the same effortless way as they have in all their previous endeavors. Blunt is also quite good in her portrayal. They had several homages back to the original. For example, Sir John Talbot is the actor who originally played the Wolf Man. Now that we've covered that, let's go over the bad. My biggest problem was the writing. The dialog was clunky at best, nauseatingly melodramatic at worst. The plot (if it can be called that) was poorly defined at times, and completely ignored most of the time. Part of what defines the original Wolf Man as such a classic is the costuming and make-up. Today, with such films as District 9 or more pointedly, Avatar, the computer imaging is expected to be as close to perfect as possible. In Wolfman, the imagery is downright terrible. When the werewolves go into their four-legged run, they look less like an animal than they do a poorly constructed animatronic at Disneyland. They use computer generation at completely unnecessary times as well. Call me a purist, but a horse is not that difficult to ride. There is absolutely no reason that you can't at least put a stunt rider on the animal if your star has broken his tail bone or something.This is supposed to be a horror movie. Audiences today aren't impressed with the monster appearing loudly and suddenly and startling them. Audiences want Paranormal Activity, where the director subtly uses effects, small noises, and dialog to honestly scare them. The werewolf and a feral child that resembles Gollum from The Lord of the Rings closely enough to be considered copyright infringement pop out of nowhere and disappear suddenly enough times and in such a similar manner that they probably could have just reused the same shots from earlier in the film. That is, if the editor could get out of his own way.Speaking of the editing, some cuts are downright terrible, with the characters completely changing positions, holding new items, or the background being drastically altered. Admittedly, there are directors who do this ironically, who edit in ways that make cigarettes grow, then shrink, then grow again, but that was clearly not the intention in this movie.When it comes right down to it, this movie is awful. The audience at the midnight screening I attended was laughing, and it wasn't because of the witty, fresh dialog. It's in that horrible wasteland that some movies inhabit where it's not nearly bad enough to be a farce, but not nearly good enough to be worth spending money on. It's not nearly good enough to spend time on. I beg you, dear reader, save yourself the pain and save Benicio Del Toro and Anthony Hopkins the embarrassment and stay home and watch some Hannibal movies and maybe Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Then watch 1941's The Wolf Man. Don't see this movie.</fullReview>

A display of the Wolfman's strength and brutality. It is a werewolf movie after all. There must be sacrifices.3.) A halfway decent story. It didn't have to be great just serviceable and it was even better than I expected.To me, it was an above average werewolf movie. Bravo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The CGI Wolf!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wolfman (2010): Dir: Joe Johnston / Cast: Benicio Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt, Hugo Weaving, Geraldine Chaplin: Effective retelling of the famous horror fable about lurking evil. Benicio Del Toro arrives home to the death of his brother who was attacked by some creature. After being bitten himself his body takes the form of a wolf during the full moon. Makeup artist Rick Baker reminds us of his superior American Werewolf in London while director Joe Johnston showcases the great shape shifting effects and the howling at the moon to a near overkill. Johnson previously made a tamer monster related film called Jumanji as well as the hideous Jurassic Park 3. Del Toro presents the size for an individual cursed with capabilities that are beyond his control during a full moon. Emily Blunt plays his brother's fiancé who will ultimately attempt to protect Del Toro before becoming the plot solution. Anthony Hopkins as his father brings taunting conviction before secrets are revealed. Hugo Weaving is the one disappointment as an investigator who only leave the door open for a sequel. Geraldine Chaplin plays a gypsy woman because these films seem to be in demand of them but they do add to the tone of these films. We are treated to a great werewolf battle that stems after building tension in the quiet dark shadows. While the 1941 version remains a classic, there is not much reason for this update other than to illustrate the change in technology. This update has plenty of corny setbacks that prevent it from reaching greatness but fans of horror suspense films will likely howl for more. Score: 7 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised to realize by watching the movie that THE WOLFMAN was actually not that bad as many people and critics considered it to be. I liked THE WOLFMAN. Yes, alright, one thing I do agree with is that THE WOLFMAN isn't a great and classical film and suffers from a surprising lack of a thoroughly suspenseful and chilling script but it still has some good stuff and that include the film's tone, the blood, gore and violence, the suspense, the old-school scares, the makeup, the environment and Anthony Hopkin's character. Another flaw is the fact that everyone, except Hopkin's character, don't bring much impact to the movie and that's unfortunate. The CGI transformation of Benedicio Del Torro's character into the wolf man while attached to a chair is another problem because the CGI looked a little too cartooning and it should have been improved. Yet another flaw in this movie is that THE WOLFMAN lacks in animal instinct and in a strong feeling of caring for the protagonist being painfully transformed into a werewolf. I would regard the film overall as having a well written script but a lack of a thoroughly suspenseful and chilling script. My rating: 7.1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of those movies I eagerly anticipated back when it was released. I'm a fan of werewolf stories in general and have always been saddened by the lack of quality films made about them.For me, the big thing about The Wolfman, was Benicio Del Toro, I thought he was the perfect choice once I heard he'd be starring.I must admit, that what I was left feeling after seeing this movie, was disappointment. The music is great, the costumes and the scenery so beautiful that I could weep. Del Toro was very good, Emily Blunt was a refreshing version of a beauty loved by the beast and Anthony Hopkins, at times, was incredible.I'm left blaming the director and the script over the fact that despite such great elements to build a movie from, this one fell flat.The basic storyline, after Lawrence's arrival in England, is all over the place. From the eerie, haunting tone in the beginning of the movie, I was hoping for something more subtle and maybe see Lawrence battling against his curse. Instead there was a werewolf on a rampage killing people left and right and a horrible shot of him howling at the moon on top of a building.I thought there was too little of the internal struggle of Lawrence's over the curse and over his obvious feelings for Gwen and the storyline between him and his father wasn't used to the extent it could have.Also, a pet peeve of mine, there was the lovely mother killed by her brute of a husband storyline that has been over used.The reason for such a high rating despite my complaints, is mainly due to the visual part of the film. I own the director's cut DVD and play it from time to time when I feel like being inspired. Also, the acting was solid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wolfman is a remake of the 1941 Universal Pictures horror film as Lawrence Talbot (Benicio del Toro) returns to England and be with his father (Anthony Hopkins) after his brother has been killed in the countryside. There is talk of some gypsy curse.Lawrence wants to find out how his brother died as he is haunted with memories of the death of his mother. He has a strange sense with the relationship with his father and one night he is attacked by a wolf and later on there is a full moon.The film is big budget with good special effects used to recreate Victorian London but the film is oddly paced, it starts off slow although the actions scenes are fast paced.Del Toro looks perfect casting as Talbot and reminds you somewhat of Lon Chaney Jr but to me he never convinces me as an Englishman. Hopkins on the other hand oozes villainy, he is too obvious a bad guy here that there is very little surprise as to who the werewolf could be. Emily Blunt is the standard and rather blank love interest and Hugo Weaving injects spirit and a little humour as the police inspector on the chase.However the film disappoints the screenplay is just too plain and dull. Even the werewolf transformation does not look special anymore as we have seen something similar so many times since An American werewolf in London. The vicious and visceral battle scene at the climax of the film is good though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Bloody, but where is the tragedy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost all of the classic Universal Studios monster movies have been remade, some of them multiple times through the years. Two of the best known; "Creature from the Black Lagoon" and "The Wolfman" had not been remade until now. The creature will continue to wait for its redo, but The Wolfman's time has come. The 1941 classic with Lon Chaney JR. could be one of Universals most tragic monsters of all time. This remake is reborn in the capable hands of Benicio Del Toro in the title role as Lawrence Talbot. Set in the year 1891, Talbot (Del Toro) is an actor who was working in America and is called back to his home in England with the discovery of the brutal death of his brother Ben. He reunites with his father John (Hopkins) and brother's fiancé Gwen (Blunt) who is staying at the crumbling family mansion. Hearing that Gypsies may have had something to do with his brother's demise, Lawrence goes to their camp in hope of answers. Out of nowhere, a vicious beast attacks in bloody fashion. Talbot is bitten by it while trying to rescue a boy in the woods. When the next full moon rises, Talbot transforms into the Wolfman and goes on a rampage. The local Scotland Yard inspector Abberline (Weaving) captures Talbot who is rushed off and placed into an asylum. It is obvious that father John knows more than he is telling. Meanwhile, at the asylum a foolish doctor proceeds to present Talbot's condition as only being in his head before a medical theater. Talbot explodes into the Wolfman and more bloody mayhem ensues as he impales the doctor and runs through the city slicing up the town people with Abberline in pursuit. Once Lawrence comes out of it he returns home to confront his father about the secret he knows and what really happened to his mother. This much delayed remake kept getting pulled back by Universal. It's not clear what the problems were and why it kept being pulled back but the story comes across as choppy and fragmented. It feels like you are watching the chunks that were left after the meat of the story had been cut out. This remake wanders from the original films storyline mainly concerning the true identity of father John. This comes in the way of a late in the film story twist that leaves a lot to be desired. This twist was truly unnecessary and does not help the film much at all. Del Toro is competent as Talbot, but the ragged story doesn't give him much to do but wander from scene to scene wondering what he did when he was the Wolfman. Chaney JR.'s emotional depth of his character is what made that version so tragic. This remake ignores the desperate anguish that the original had and seems only interested in Talbot acting on revenge against those who wronged him. The cast is solid all the way around with Hugo weaving stealing scenes as the Inspector. Director Joe Johnston makes the film look fantastic. The full moon and its effect on atmosphere and mood really help. The time period it is set in also makes the film seem authentic. Rick Baker's use of practical effects mixed with small doses of CGI really worked making the transformation scenes great. The Wolfman never looked better. This film gets bloody, really bloody. Gore hounds will enjoy the splatter of blood everywhere. Intestines are ripped out; heads and limbs get knocked off bodies' right and left. The rampage through town is especially gory. There is something to be said for less is more. There is no doubt if this were real the trail of bodies and limbs would be like depicted here. As a film the excessive gore doesn't really match the tone and setting, and it just might have been scarier if more was left to the audiences mind. Johnston gets some good scares and even some jumps out of his audience by making this vicious beast act like this. The ferocious attacks by the beast are intense and catch the viewer off guard, which works to good effect. Gone is the subtlety and tragic feel of the original and what is left is a brutal and bloody remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lawrence Talbot's childhood ended when his mother died. His father sent him to an insane asylum.When his brother's fiancée, Gwen Conliffe, tracks him down to help find him, Talbot returns to his father's estate to learn that his brother's body has been found.Reunited with his father, Lawrence sets out to find his brother's killer, and discovers a horrifying secret for himself.Something with brute strength has been killing the villagers, and a suspicious Scotland Yard inspector comes to investigate...It felt like forever when this film was announced to it's final release date, and it really wasn't worth the wait. Kudos to Del Toro for being patient with all the changes, he is the best thing about the film, but it seems it's trying to hard to be like Coppolas Dracula.Hopkins is his over the top self, and Weaving is nothing more than Agent Smith with facial hair.When we see the transformation, it all feels a little to League of Extraordinary Gentleman, but the first attack on the villagers is good, and the highlight of the film.The rest of the cast seem to be under the influence of some narcotic, and despite the directors best efforts, it never gets more than campy at best.The final battle is too Van Helsing, but thank you makers for getting one of the wolves to take its shirt off, because I wouldn't have known which wolf was which (insert sarcasm).All in all, it's watchable, but not the film it wanted to be..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Your standard big budget thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start, i am a huge fan of Benicio del Toro so whenever i see a movie of his i am a little biased in how i view the movie, for the positive of course. His performance in this film was deeply nuanced and something that i did not expect for him to pull off quite so well, but keeping that in mind i felt like the film didn't leave much for del Toro to work with. Now first, this film did win the academy award for make-up because it was really good, set design was good, the costumes were good, but where it shined in aesthetics it lacked in writing quality. This film had a stellar cast, Benicio del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Hugo Weaving, Emily Blunt all of whom i think are great actors but i'm afraid the writing didn't leave them much to work with. It felt like i was watching another rendition of Stephen Sommers' Van Helsing only with better actors and make-up.Don't get me wrong it wasn't terrible, it just felt like a high school play with a multi million dollar budget. If you're going to get those names and spend that kind of money on special effects the film should at least be interesting, at least beyond the central plot of the film, which neither of the two writers who created this adaption of the 1941 original came up with. Any addition made to the main story by these writers was a needless one and it did not contribute to the plot or character development any. In essence it really felt like two guys in their basement decided that they loved the original Wolfman so much that they wanted to do their own version with their own plot twists, but instead of them using a super 8 camera they used state of the art high tech digital cameras and tons of CGI to capture their less than interesting visions. Now granted i'm not a huge fan of films in this genre, but i know when i see a good one and i don't think this film was it. This film did not capture my imagination like i wanted it to and i didn't feel connected with the characters, the only thing that kept me watching was that i wanted to see what would happen at the end, even though in the back of my mind i knew what the ending was without ever seeing the original film, the plot was just that predictable and unoriginal. So overall, a decently made film but nothing amazing, if your looking for a movie you don't have to think about this is great otherwise don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The wolf is in us, at least as a desire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The interest of the film is not the legend about werewolves. It is not the connection of these mythical animals with the gypsies who are supposed to come from India where very old religions were based on bloody rituals of all types from human sacrifice to human torturing and the use of the blood and various organs of the appointed volunteers for religious purposes. The Bon religion was one of these up in the Himalayas that was recuperated by Buddhism when it arrived in Tibet, but you had the same type of religions in India per se before Hinduism even if most of their rites seem to have disappeared, although I have come across the practice of "giving the water" to the widows of a king who has just died, meaning the widows, wives or concubines, had to drink the poison that would put them to death, and it was still common in the fifth century and naturally evoked by some pilgrims in Sigiriya, Sri Lanka, still in the 9th century. And torturing was a very common practice and it was fantasized by Indian Jones in all possible ways.But the film is really interesting because it is situated at the end of the 19th century in England, at the end of the Victorian era. They wanted to be scientific and thus the doctors considered werewolves did not exist and were only the delusion of a sick person who deserved treatment, and then they turned torturers with treatments like full immersion in a bathtub and electric shocks and all types of injections. And such treatments, plus the modern practice of lobotomy, were still practiced in the USA and some other civilized and developed countries thirty years ago, and are still advocated by some doctors for gay people for one example, still in western countries, like the USA, particularly some states like Utah and organization like the Mormons.The film then sets the case of a werewolf inside his family and in spite of all the care he takes to tie himself up during the full moon night, in a way or another, he gets trapped out and he starts with killing his wife and twenty or twenty-five years later he kills one of his sons, the one who had stayed on the estate, and then when the second son arrives for the funeral he attacks him and turns him into a werewolf in his turn and then you can imagine the oedipal situation created by these events. And all that in one provincial 18th century mansion with the furniture and all the props and decoration from this time and the phenomenally intricate setting and disposition inside and outside.But that is all. Then the film is carried by the action, the rhythm of it, the simple but yet complicated hunt by the police, the sentimental involvement of the first brother's girlfriend with the second brother even when he is turned into a werewolf which leads to a sentimental and romantic ending, with a punchline because one cop managed to get scratched by the last werewolf of this family, the second son, the prodigal son as his father calls him, since he is the son who moved out, to New York mind you, to have a carrier on theatrical stages, playing Shakespeare, Hamlet and Richard III, are we told. The werewolf is migrating out of the aristocratic family and to London.That was the come back of the werewolf to the screen before Anne Rice captured the myth and turned her werewolves into adorable justice makers and civil beings who would never hurt anyone who does not deserve it. In this film the werewolf is nothing but a plain killer. Too bad! He could have been a darling of a monster, since we all like blood, but with a smile and a spoonful of sugar, califragilisticexpialidocious, though we should write it with a capital K at the beginning because Kali is from India and known as the black god of time and death, the lord of death, the bloody consort of Shiva, the destroyer and the transformer, a bloody god too, and since both are as much male as they are female, they can embody and impersonate any kind of loving relation, and they live on their sexual lust just as much as they do on their blood lust. The film is not elaborating on this subject in spite of the presence of a Hindu character in the house. The film is just satisfying the strong desire any audience in this global world is experiencing for the appealing werewolves that can purr in your lap if you know how to tame them.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow.For me, this is one of those films you don't expect too much from, but it delivers WAY more than you thought it ever could. Hollywood doesn't do remakes very well, but this film is the exception, and I found it to be pretty exciting, and very entertaining.The cast was great, as can be expected based on their track record in other films.The "look" was great. The film had texture, doom, gloom, and was definitely pleasing to watch and examine.The "Wolfman" was appropriate, and well done IMO. Good make up and decent special effects made it easy to suspend your disbelief and enjoy the show.The action was pretty intense. This film took a straight forward approach to the actions of the beast, and to sum it up: The Wolfman kicks ass. Period.Seriously.The beast in this film does NOT play around...much. It pretty much wades through people hacking at a limb here, clawing at a throat there. The actions are brutal, and straight up beastly, and it ROCKED. I would like to see this direct approach used more often in films, as it works very well, and adds a sense of dread to the film. Well done.I enjoyed how the story unfolded, and while there may be a plot hole here or there, I didn't find anything that took much away from the film as a whole.All in all, a pretty entertaining and fun film, and I was surprised by how much I actually enjoyed the film. Give it a shot.8 of 10 stars (bonus for the surprise factor)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Regarding the recent trend in remakes, The Wolfman is actually pretty good. I think it successfully updates the earlier 1940's version. This film has plenty of action and thrills/chills. I really did not expect much going into this because of the horrid reviews. But I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this movie as much as I did.This film is about a guy who comes back home to his estranged family after his brother has been killed savagely by a beast. But as he goes to confront this creature, he gets bitten by it and bears a curse that will ultimately turn him not human anymore.Benicio Del Toro carries the film as his portrayal of Lawrence Talbot. He really showed lots of emotion as the guy who is bearing the heavy weight of heavy losses of people close to him. I was kind of disappointed with Anthony Hopkins. He started off terrible, but did end the film in a bright spot.Overall, this is a good film as remakes go. The script is a little muddled but nothing like good acting to compliment that. The makeup and production design are very, very good. I thought, at times, that myself was in the 19th Century. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lavish, Atmospheric, Quality Remake Of Classic Universal Monster Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When his brother dies in gruesome circumstances, thespian Lawrence Talbot returns to his ancestral home to investigate. One night he visits a nearby gypsy camp amid rumours of a strange beast on the loose, but tragedy awaits ...This enjoyable and scary reworking of the classic 1941 George Waggner / Lon Chaney Jr film has most everything a good remake should - a bigger budget to do the story real justice, many references to the original whilst creating its own visual style, a top-notch cast, and a storyline which adds many interesting twists to the tale. I also get the sense that all the filmmakers wanted to make a proper horror film, which is played straight as pure tragedy, set in 1891, intensely dark and almost old-fashioned in its sensibilities. It's a movie about a cursed family, blood, the moon and horror, and that's pretty much it. Like the 1979 Hollywood remake of Dracula, it's a powerful colour retelling of a great old scary story. I've always loved werewolf movies, and they set a unique challenge for the actor playing the monster; they must be sympathetic, but at the same time a murderous beast - how do you do this ? Del Toro is great; quiet and thoughtful, overcome with suffering and grief, his performance juxtaposes well with Hopkins' grandiose firebrand as he quotes the Gospel of Luke and generally causes mayhem, whilst the strong supporting cast all acquit themselves well. Best of all however is the ever-reliable Weaving, as the dour-faced Inspector Abberline (the real life detective from the Jack the Ripper case), who steals all his scenes - don't miss his perfectly delivered soliloquy to the pub landlady. The visual scope of the film is fantastic - the sets and costumes are excellent, Danny Elfman's full-on orchestral score is wonderful and transports the listener to the amazing other world depicted, and the second half particularly is full of wild scenes as the monster rampages across the moonlit rooftops of Victorian London. I also really love the special effects by Rick Baker, who goes for a classic hairy biped creature - this movie is about a Wolf Man - which not only looks sensational but is a loving tribute to its predecessor. There are a few things I don't like, chief amongst them being the pacing, which is too fast, rushing through flashbacks and dreams instead of taking time to build suspense, and the development of the Talbot family's fortune (particularly the Hopkins character) takes some swallowing. Director Johnston (Honey I Shrunk The Kids, Jumanji) shows a sure hand however and blends all the elements of the film together well, creating a modern Gothic blockbuster with thrills and chills aplenty. A great movie and a must for all fans of Cinema Lycanthropa.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just when you think the horror genre can't rise above it's preoccupation with mindless gore - it does! The Wolfman features excellent locations, impressive period sets, intelligent dialogue and a hard-to-beat cast. Anthony Hopkins gives a wonderfully subtle and ironic performance, Hugo Weaving is ideally cast as the Victorian era Scotland Yard Inspector, Benicio Del Toro is solidly believable and there's a nice little cameo piece by Geraldine Chaplin. The plot is not exactly riddled with unexpected twists - the core story line is, after all, rather well known - but it is well managed and maintains pace and interest. Blood-soaked directors please take note - this is a thinking person's horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than you think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure why there's so many negative reviews of this fine horror film, but I was very impressed for the most part, as I consider myself a horror fanatic. The Wolfman had some flaws, mainly overdone special effects and some of the dialog, but overall, I was glad I made the time to finally see it. The dark, foggy atmosphere was brilliant, and the gloomy scenery added to what was a pure suspenseful picture that gave me some scares and I'm over 40. Anthony Hopkins and Hugo Weaving more or less carried this film in regards to the acting, and Benicio Del Toro wasn't too bad, although some of his lines didn't seem believable; for example, when he calls the doctor a "moron", I seriously doubt that word was spoken in the 1800's. As I said above, some of the special effects, but not all, were downright excessive, but not as nearly as bad as Van Helsing(2004), but it did detract from the overall quality of the film; I thought when the wolf was running amok and killing all the villagers seemed to happen too quick and was overly savage. Let me add that other than these aspects of the film, overall, I was very impressed, especially the opening sequence with Ben, who was killed by the wolf in a rather scary scene. It turns out that Lawrence and Ben's father, John Talbot,(Hopkins)was actually the wolf, and he killed Ben and their mother years ago, and bit Lawrence(Del Toro), which turns him into a wolf; Lawrence and Gwen(Emily Blunt), who was Ben's squeeze have some awkward moments together, and there's some kind of forced tension, and she supposedly now loves Lawrence, because he needs to be killed by someone he loves, and she ends up shooting and killing Lawrence with a silver bullet right before he kills her. Let me add that Hugo Weaving(Abberline)has some slick scenes as he's on the beast's trail, and is a very confident man. The werewolf(Hopkins)against werewolf(Del Toro)scene between father and son was thankfully short, with Lawrence winning the fight. If you can get past some of the things I mentioned earlier, then this should be a very enjoyable and scary horror film which we don't get to see the likes of anymore these days, but this one makes up for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrific yet Tragically Romantic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought it was great. I have seen both the original and this version, and I sort of enjoy this one better. Before I get attacked for saying this, I do appreciate the original. For it's time, the special effects were incredibly innovative and included some of the most historically brilliant actors. However, we have advanced in cinematic technique. The timing in the original was off, acting wise. I found it hard to sit through a few parts. The wolfman's design was not intimidating at all, and I have never found the design intimidating, not even when I was little. Another issue that the original didn't take into consideration is that a full moon does not stick around for a few nights. This version showed us beautifully through a sequence of montages and just an overall feeling that this movie was set over a span of a few months. With this version, there were of course a few weak spots. CGI being a big one. For Rick Baker being involved in the special effects of American Werewolf in London (which used no CGI and provided possibly the BEST transformation scene ever), I was very disappointed. If he doesn't bring us here what he brought us in American Werewolf in London, then I don't care what his name is. The transformation sequences were still painful to watch, but it didn't feel like the transformation was happening to del Toro. Speaking of del Toro, I actually thought he was a very strong point in the movie. With such a short time span as a movie, del Toro and his character managed to wow me with such extreme character development. I liked how del Toro started off in the movie as such a tough cookie, then throughout the movie you watched him slowly unravel. He had sympathetic qualities from the beginning of the movie on. His romance with Blunt's character was not as head-on as it was in the original. It was sweet and well worked into, and Talbot actually had to prove himself to Gwen, whereas the original fazed me as nothing more than a sudden, desperate yet romanticized love affair.***SPOILER****The plot twist of Talbot's father being the werewolf that bit him was foreseen, but well-executed. Back to the CGI, relating it to the Golem-like creature that bit John Talbot, Lawrence's father. Why not make the creature (supposedly a werewolf child), look like a mini wolfman? The tragic ending was also well-executed and added the tragically romantic element to the film that the original had tried to accomplish through the love affair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw some reviews for this movie that were very bad and I can't really understand why. It's a MONSTER movie. It's not promising a masterpiece. And for a monster movie, it is surprisingly good. It's not a slasher, it doesn't glorify the violence, just keeps gross and gory. I thought the casting was excellent. Del Toro was the perfect successor to Lon Chaney Jr and Emily Blunt was well suited for the role of Gwen, not glamorous, but very genuine. I have to say, however, that Anthony Hopkins stole the show. He was absolutely creepy and added a great eerie aspect to all his scenes. Overall, the movie was beautiful, very unusual for a horror film. I felt it stuck true to the original Hollywood horrors. Danny Elfman's score was dark and complements the scenes well. (He's always been my favorite movie composer.) Last of all, I have to mention the actual wolf man. The monster looked great. Using makeup instead of CGI gave in real presence on screen and it looked like the original only scarier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What you call such a film?? Joe Johnston was known for larger then life entertaining and illogical films The Wolfman is one of them. The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones: Spring Break Adventure (1999) and Jumanji (1995) both hits but this was a flop The film is a remake of The Wolf Man (1941)) but sadly the film falls flat In short the problems: The initial horror bits are too stupid, especially the weird characters on the ship Benicio Del Toro's flirting with Emily Blunt and their bedroom scene too amateurish Even there are half a dozen clichés The Aamir- Manisha track however does click and the scenes with Anthony Hopkins are superb and also the twist in the tale is well handled but the film drags in second half yet Del Toro's transformation is well handled and also the climax is good I would recommend this movie for all those Joe Johnston &amp; Toms Hanks fans whom enjoy their 90s movies, very under-rated movie includes packed actions and emotions.Del Toro does his part very well especially the transformation from a human to a mastiff is convincing though he irritates at times trying to be a flirt Emily Blunt irritates too at times but her chemistry with Del Toro is terrific and she does superb mostly But her non make up look is boring Mario Marin-Borquez is adequate in his small role Amongst rest Art Malik is lovable, Simon Merrells is okay Gemma Whelan Vohra is funny at times....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wolfman is quite a wonderful film. It's gory, exciting and scary with some real emotional weight. Unfortunately the emotions and character development have been streamlined to move the film along at a blistering rate. Del Toro is a brilliant lead, capturing a slight hint of insanity that suggests he may be the madmen locals accuse him of being. Hopkins hams it up with enough restraint to make him believable. There's isn't much subtlety to his role, but he does create mystery. The action scenes are magnificent, and the CGI/make-up mix isn't too shabby either. It's a film with many flaws, but flaws you can look past. When the CGI does falter, it just adds to the campy monster fun. Afterall, the dissolve transition effects of the original are hardly spine-tingling. It's a shame that the constant nudging of studio pressure is forever present, but for 100 minutes I couldn't look away. Now that it's over, I can't wait to go back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... I seemed to enjoy this film. Why? Well, for one reason. After I was attempting to see Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief after reading the books the first installment was based on (I thought it was a decent enough film), my older brother wanted to see this remake of a 1940 classic that I've never heard of. So we waited for another day at AMC and we've bought our tickets and the movie began after the previews. We enjoyed it and I was shocked to see that this was directed by Joe Johnston who did one of my personal favorites Jumanji. I understand the criticism it had from Rottentomatoes, but I honestly think this is a pretty interesting film.Sure, the script is predictable and the dialogue seemed too cliché ridden at times and I'll admit that the second half of the film does deviates itself from the original's plot. Even the pacing was too slow.With that said, the actors are pretty good from their performances, but arguably, the best actors in the movie goes to Benicio Del Toro who did a performance so emotional when portraying Lawrence Talbot, Emily Blunt for the lovely Gwen, Hugo Weaving as the interesting Inspector Aberline and Anthony Hopkins as the brilliant Sir John Talbot. The settings are amazing that looked exactly like the one from the original, not to mention the look of London is very pretty. The scary moments in this film are amusing and the music from Danny Elfman is wonderful that keeps the Gothic atmosphere at it's place while the story had potential in the first half. The make up of the werewolf is the strongest aspect of the movie and it showed how dark and scary-looking it was.Although not as horrible as the critics said it was, The Wolfman would have had a better script and even better pacing, but due to its amazing cast, amusing visuals, and great makeup, this remake is worth to any die-hard monster film.Rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a remake of a 1940's classic and brought to modern day audience with all this werewolf and vampire frenzy thing going on with Twilight and True Blood. I will tell you right now that the Wolfman is not for everyone. In my opinion, it does what it sets out to do, it tells a story about a tortured man who gets bitten by a werewolf and eventually turns into one. Benicio Del Toro is a fantastic actor in his role and handles it with care. Anthony Hopkins like always plays the creepy character in a horror movie like Hannibal Lector. Hugo Weaving is alittle out of place in my opinion in this movie but still manages to make the best of his situation. Emily Blunt is the biggest standout because at times i felt like she was forced into the story to give the main character a love interest. Overall, if you like horror movies or are trying to satisfy your hunger for supernatural creatures of the dark then this movie will please you. If you are not really into any of this stuff then just ignore the movie overall. Honestly, it wont win any awards or be remembered as a great movie but i will give it a 9 for doing what it set out to do but not a 10 because as my title says, Good but not great. Hope this helped you and enjoy the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another version of the age-old popular myth, with a little more spice. The opening of the movie was sort of corny, but the story made up for it. The graphics were very much realistic to a horrifying extent, as I'm sure was the idea. The movie rating might underestimate the terrifying images and blood and gore. I don't know why, but I had to see this movie; I'm glad I braved it. This movie reveals the heart in every beast, and the beast in every man. It revolves around loss, family, love and insanity. I enjoyed this story of the wolfman myth mostly because it showed more love and emotion. Most of the time, determination overrode the characters' fear; maybe not for the good of their lives, but sometimes ignorant people need to learn the hard way. It's just a shame it has to be that way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful set design and musical score can't save pointless blood-fest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Wolfman' is a remake of the 1941 horror 'classic' of the same name, starring Lon Chaney Jr. By changing the setting to Victorian England, the remake is light years ahead of the original in the set design department. I happened to love all the costumes, the locales where the film was shot as well as the Danny Elfman score which manages to add a lot more weight to the film, which suffers from the original paltry concept and some noxious re-imaginings found in this new revision.I simply fail to understand why people are drawn to the whole Wolfman concept in the first place. It has little basis in reality unless you're drawn to those stories of humans raised by apes in the jungle who are unable to throw off their primitive inclinations due to their unusual upbringing. Of course in those rare cases, the human being doesn't find himself transformed into a beast and then reverting to human form, whenever daylight finally breaks.As a myth, the Wolfman seems awfully simplistic. What does one learn after undergoing the 'Wolfman' experience in the movies? That men are capable of horrible violence when the thin veneer of civilization is swept away? So what! In a sense, the Wolfman character is a paganistic, pre-Christian representative of the Devil. Where the Devil is a beast in human form, the Wolfman is a human in a fake, beast-like form. Those viewers with unconscious aggressive wishes are vicariously drawn in part to the fake beast, who with his superhuman strength, rips peoples' heads off with a flick of his paw-like hand. Not only do they take delight in a character that can best be found conjured up in a five-year-old's nightmare, but also cheer just as loudly, when the fake creature meets its end at the hands of a superstitious, vengeful mob. The mob finally figures out a way to snuff out the life of this maniacal figure, who somehow emanates from a dream-like world. It's much more difficult coming to terms with devils such as the Nazis, whose evil had a human face and were not so easily defeated as the Wolfman is here.'The Wolfman' (the remake) changes the plot of the original 1941 film by introducing the idea that the Wolfman's father, Sir John Talbot, is actually a Wolfman himself and is responsible for the death of his son, Ben Talbot. Lawrence Talbot, now an American actor (having left England after the death of mother), initially returns to the family estate to investigate the disappearance of his brother, but soon learns that the brother has been murdered. Later, it's revealed that Sir John's faithful servant, Singh, has been keeping him locked up for years in the castle whenever the full moon appears, preventing the father from escaping and fomenting havoc throughout the countryside.The problem is that Sir John is an utterly, unlikable character who's depicted as not having one modicum of charm. He's such a churl that he doesn't hesitate in informing Lawrence that he's responsible for murdering his mother, his brother and also turning Lawrence into a werewolf as well. Instead of sticking up for the son (who's being hunted by a determined Scotland Yard Inspector as well as assorted meanies from the town), Sir John would rather (pardon the pun), throw his son to the wolves! Lawrence as the Wolfman has a similar problem. Unlike the Frankenstein monster or a modern version such as Terminator II, he's not what you would call, a 'conflicted' creature. The good side never comes out until maybe the end, when he realizes that it's Gwen (the woman who falls for both Ben and Lawrence), who he's about to rip apart, turning her into the expected umpteenth bloody mess. While Lawrence terrorizes both urban and rural parts of England, he's simply a killing machine, ripping all kinds of body parts from living human beings. All this becomes tiresome since we're praying that perhaps his human side might emerge and the Inspector will now have reasons in hesitating to do the creature in.Was anyone else bothered by the fact that the The Wolfman's demise is a foregone conclusion? I found it deflating that Maleva, the gypsy woman, informs Gwen that there's no cure for the Wolfman's curse. The best we can look forward to is that the Wolfman dies in the presence of someone who loves him. Once all that is brought out, the climax is utterly predictable and one realizes that 'The Wolfman' is a film with virtually no surprises.'The Wolfman' could have been a much more interesting film if it had some stakes (pardon the pun again), that you could bite your teeth into! How about a satire or critique on the Victorian age--the era in which the film is set in? In the end, 'The Wolfman' is all atmosphere. One must be content with admiring the attention to detail?yes, dig those illustrations on the front page of the newspaper that chronicles "the monster's" deeds, that the Inspector thrusts in Gwen's face when he visits her antique store! Very cool! As for the Wolfman story?unfortunately, that's something that's not very hard to forget, in a virtual instant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost 70 years later, The Wolfman remains a great tragic character.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) has been away from home for many years, working as a prominent stage actor, after witnessing a traumatic sight as a young boy. Upon learning of the death of his brother, he returns home to his father Sir John (Anthony Hopkins) and his brothers' fiancée Gwen (Emily Blunt). During the hunt for the beast that savaged his brother, he gets badly bitten himself, surviving to carry the curse of lycanthropy.Although apparently respectful of the classic 1941 werewolf movie starring Lon Chaney, Jr., this remake is too much in the mold of some modern horror movies, ultimately abandoning any sense of subtlety in favour of a full steam ahead, action packed approach, with our rampaging monster running and leaping all about the place, video game style. That's not to say that this big budget production doesn't get some things right. For one thing, the exterior and location work is great, with fine work done by production designer Rick Heinrichs and cinematographer Shelly Johnson. Danny Elfmans' music is absolutely thunderous at times. Rick Baker, revered for his memorable effects for "An American Werewolf in London", creates an effective looking creature (itself showing the proper amount of respect for the iconic look that Jack Pierce gave Chaney back in '41) as well as some very juicy gore (in the unrated version). Excellent atmosphere is set up well immediately, but we get a little too good a look at the monster too soon, eliminating some of the suspense.Del Toro, also one of the producers, is very understated as the doomed Lawrence, while the beautiful Blunt is appealing as his concerned leading lady. The evolving relationship between them does give the movie the emotional centre that is needed. Hugo Weaving is amusing as the inspector confronted with this hideous murder spree, and Art Malik is solid as Singh. Geraldine Chaplin is good as Maleva, even though it's inevitable that she won't make anyone forget Maria Ouspenskaya. With Hopkins always playing his character as somewhat "off", the ultimate reveal regarding Sir John shouldn't come as too much of a surprise.One interesting new touch is the inclusion of asylum scenes (Lawrence had already been confined to this place as a child) wherein skeptical doctors are determined to prove that Lawrences' affliction is all in his head; seeing Lawrence subjected to what amounts to torture is very uncomfortable. The ending is just as emotionally resonant as is necessary, and one can feel the characters' pain.This would rate as a good effort overall that at the very least I would not consider boring.Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent FX not Enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wolfman" Upon learning of his brother's disappearance, Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) returns to the home he left many years before. When he arrives, he finds the house in shambles with his father, Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins), teetering on the edge of insanity. When his brother's body is discovered, Lawrence stays around, in part to comfort his brother's former fiancé Gwen (Emily Blunt), and in part to determine how his brother died. The story around town is that the death was at the hands of the Wolfman, a local legend. Soon Lawrence is himself attacked by the creature, setting up a brutal showdown with the demons of his past.At one point, "Wolfman" was so respected as to garner award anticipation. Quite quickly, however, this attention waned as the movie was shifted all over the calendar until it finally settled into the Movie Dead Zone that is February. I held out a small measure of hope if for no other reason than the actors involved. I think Del Toro is an excellent talent who usually delivers and while Hopkins hasn't done anything of value in years (and years and years), I still want to believe he's got something left in the tank.Unfortunately, "Wolfman" is a train wreck. The story is mediocre at best and seriously choppy throughout. There is little to no character development and the special effects are of low rent video game quality. Del Toro holds up his end of the bargain but he is left completely and totally alone on the acting front lines. Emily Blunt, whom I have a giant crush on, just doesn't get much of a chance to do anything as her part is basically pointless. And then there's Hopkins. Oh, Anthony Hopkins, how I miss you. Hopkins gives one of the most mailed-in performances I have ever seen. He is completely uninspired and uninterested in his role, the movie, and maybe even breathing. I equate the last 10 years of Hopkins' career to that of Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis in that both were GREAT in their day but now it's unclear if either is still alive. It's like Hopkins died years ago but his family, in need of some quick cash, has reanimated his body and run a scam on the whole of Hollywood, continuing to sign his name to awful movies. Del Toro and the occasional glimpse of inspired FX keep "Wolfman" from being a total loss but it's not far off.Check out my site: www.thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid remake, though not as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wolfman (1941)was an undeniable classic, and without a doubt, the greatest were-wolf movie ever made. There was absolutely no way that the remake could match up to the original. But, the good thing about the remake was that it changed quite a number of things from the original. However, some of the changes were not so much a good idea. For example, Larry Talbot (or Lawrence) in the remake is not as like-able as the original, Benicio Del Toro does a great job as a man who is going to become a were-wolf, but he doesn't play the role as a character you feel sorry for him that much when he transforms, when in the original, you do. Maybe its just the writing, but none the less, Del Toro does a great job, but not as good as Lon Chaney Jr. Another thing it changes from the original, is that John Talbot is a were-wolf. And no, not the "I am so sad because I am a were-wolf", the "I have gone insane with the power of a were-wolf". Seriously, the guy is unpredictable, first he's trying to help his son, then he leaves him to become a were-wolf, then he just lets him get sent to an asylum, then he tells him to commit suicide, then he beats him, then the two of them have a were-wolf brawl, THE GUY IS UNPREDICTABLE! Which leads me to another thing I like about the changes made. This is probably the first movie to have a freakin' WERE- WOLF BRAWL! Seriously, a were-wolf brawl. The were-wolf brawl is the scene in the remake that, in a way, replaces the fight between The Were-wolf and Sir John at the end of the original. It is so over-the-top! One of the highlights of the movie, an absolute must-see moment if you are a were-wolf fan.Other changes include the useless characters. However, this just adds to the new movie's "charm". The villagers are all disposable. All horror movies need "the disposables", or useless characters that are there to either cause trouble or get killed. The original didn't have much death scenes or death of villagers, maybe two or three. But the remake wastes no time with the deaths of the disposables. It makes them as quick and as awesome as possibleThe death scenes in the movie are sadistic, or in other words, perfect for a were-wolf movie. There's not too much gore, and the movie knows how to balance a good death scene with enough gore.The story is also great, though a tad different than the original. The movie changes the story, and still manages to keep the original story intact. It adds new characters and keeps the old ones. There is a specific balance the movie holds with the boundaries of the original and remake.Overall, in the end, The Wolfman is a solid remake (something that is very rare in these days). It changes things, benefits from most of them but suffers from few of them. Among the horror movie wannabes of the 21st century, The Wolfman, in my opinion, is the only one that is truly worthy to be called a horror movie.If you are a horror movie fan looking for a breath of fresh air after all the horror movie wannabes of the 21st century-like me, then give this movie a watch. If you are a gore hound looking for a very bloody movie, you won't find it here. If you want to see what has to be one of the greatest were-wolf movies of all time, right up there with "The Howling", "Bad Moon", "American Were-Wolf in London" and "The Wolfman (1941)", then this movie is an absolute must-watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A More Believable Werewolf Portrayal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years the iconic monster The Wolfman has appeared in classic novels, engaging movies, had a cult following in cartoons, television series and comic books. Sadly, most of the Wolfman portrayals have been an utter letdown. But thanks to the brilliant craftsmanship to Joe Johnston, this newer version of "The Wolfman" is one of the best portrayals since Lon Chaney Jr. donned the role back in the 1940's. The casting was rightfully selected by a talent pool of terrific thespians. It's a shame that critics has chastised the performance of Benicio Del Toro. His talents and skills was the perfect choice for the role of Lawrence Talbot. Very little to no other actor could've pulled off the role like the way Del Toro did. He was a sad man with few friends and few people to support him. Lawrence never had a good time and never felt any signs of happiness. But Del Toro was not alone. His creepy father played by Anthony Hopkins, to the mysterious gypsy woman, to saddened sister-in-law to the headstrong Scotland Yard detective! Everyone played their respected roles superbly.I was glad that this movie never once tried out for any cheesy gimmicks by adding comedy to this horror film, like many other horror films before this one. The movie was billed as a horror movie plain and simple. The plot and the story buildup stayed within the lines of creating a horror story and nothing more. The make-up and costumes was a bit of a nail-biter, but when it comes to my favorite costume, it would have to be the werewolf itself. Not since Chaney's Wolfman did this beast fit the style and atmosphere with both the crowd from the past and still succeeds to impress the audience of toady's reception. So another hats off to the make-up and costumes department. I was scared to my wit's end when I saw the film "Silver Bullet" being that it was penned and adapted by the legend horror novelist Stephen King. Now I'm a little older and wiser I was not scared by this werewolf. But I was admired by the creepy atmosphere and the cold dreary atmosphere. It was still enough to send chills down my spine. The story emanates in the latter years of the 19th century. Which couldn't be any apropos to fit in a modern time period. I mean with our modern day equipment and digital ware, this movie would have been a sham. It would be an endless array of one constant scientifically explained analysis after another and very little in terms of scares and fear. You can't do this in this kind of a movie. This film is best set in the woods where people are constantly living in fear and horror as the only defensive mechanisms are candles and torches. This movie is a must-have collectors item. I definitely would like to watch this numerous times plus I guarantee this one will not collect dust.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood injects their formula into The Wolfman story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can always count on Hollywood to keep the remake machine turning and churning, always making sure it rehashes something that's been sitting on the burner for too long. This time it was 1941's The Wolf Man starring Lon Chaney Jr. Almost 70 years after the original 2010's The Wolfman retells the story of Lawrence Talbot, an American who is bitten by a dangerous wolf creature while visiting his father in England. The creature's bite curses him and he now turns into a wolf man monster every full moon. The movie is about what you would expect from another Hollywood remake as long as you're not expecting much. This film is your typical remake that isn't exactly that great, but not terrible either.I'll start with the positives of this film and those and simply the visuals. The film starts out bleak and gloomy and makes sure to stay that way the entire rest of the film. Most of the architecture of the film is pretty typical 19th century English sculpture and architecture, but we do see it all in a dark and shadowy atmosphere which makes it interesting. Then of course there are the numerous forest scenes which go a little overboard on the fog, but can you blame them? More fog equals more fun. It is also, for the most part, a well shot film. There is a lot to be said for any film that comes out in the ridiculous shaky-cam era that presents its action sequences clearly. Most action or horror films it is impossible to tell what's going on but thankfully The Wolfman doesn't have this problem. I have to give kudos for that.The visuals of this film coupled with the amount of gore furthermore makes it all the better. The gore is another thing I can applaud this film for. It isn't afraid to be graphic. It does try to shock the viewer with some of the graphic scenes and maybe I'm just desensitized, but those moments only made me laugh rather than gasp. For whatever reason watching the wolf man swipe the head off of a man and watching blood spurt out of the bloody neck stub just makes me instinctively laugh hysterically. And for me there's no problem with this, I just wish there had been more.This leads me to all of the negatives of this here film. First off we have a script that leaves something to be desired. The dialouge has a range from cheesy silly to lame redundant. There are a few moments where you will nod your head in approval, but this films dialouge is very dry, very one dimensional, and very dull. The characters are mostly the same way. This film has no shortage of fine actors. Benicio Del Toro plays Talbot, the lead character. He starts out dreary and uninteresting but eventually grows to fairly enticing and all of the werewolf drama around him makes him exciting enough. Overall it's a surprisingly weak effort from Mr. Del Toro. Emily Blunt plays the lead actress in an utterly useless role that serves as nothing more than a love interest for Talbot, a storyline which is utterly pointless to the films progression. I like Emily Blunt and have nothing against her but she is probably the weakest point of the film. Not because of her acting but simply because of her poorly written character. Anthony Hopkins is probably the best actor in the film and his character is pretty interesting. He delivers some of the only memorable lines of the film and he's probably the most fun character to watch. Hugo Weaving also does a good job here but his character is introduced way too late in the film for the role to reach its full potential.Lastly there is just a major issue with the whole development of the story and how this film is constructed overall. My biggest issue is the pacing of the film which jumps around all over the place. I might have been able to stand this flaw a little more if it hadn't played out exactly how I didn't want it to. Basically, the film spends way too much time on certain aspects and rushes through others. We're watching The Wolfman for the exciting monster story about how a man is bitten by a werewolf and then becomes one himself, subsequently going on a killing spree. What we're not watching The Wolfman for is a weak romantic story between two uninteresting and one dimensional characters. The film rushes through some of the most quintessential scenes of the whole film, such as when Talbot is actually bitten by the werewolf. You know, the scene that sets the entire plot into motion. The scene is cool while it lasts, but it only lasts for a few minutes in order to make room with some painfully cheesy scenes between Del Toro and Blunt and their useless romantic subplot.The Wolfman could have been really cool, but instead it will only be remembered as another lackluster Hollywood remake, or better yet, not remembered at all. Visually it is a very neat film that can be a lot of fun to watch at times. But it fails everywhere else. I didn't hate this film, but I didn't like it either. It's not hard to enjoy something about it, but if you spend about five minutes actually analyzing it you'll realize how pointlessly flawed it really is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK Werewolf Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say about Werewolves? They're just plain awesome, and they're probably my number one favorite monster. An American Werewolf in London was an awesome Werewolf movie, besides the classic Wolfman movie, probably the best out there. Now don't get me wrong I didn't sit through The Wolfman (2010) thinking about either of those movies. I never compared once. I just wanted to be entertained. And some of the time, I was. I'm going to go over what I didn't like about the film first. Don't get me wrong, I think Benicio Del Torro is a fantastic actor. But this is one of those situations where the casting was off for the main character. I didn't care about the character at all, and that was their first mistake. Benicio didn't really have that much character at all, except for one time in the film. I found his character bland, and it just wasn't inviting. A good movie reels you in with its main character. You should care for him, but I didn't in this film. They didn't do a very good job on that subject. I don't want to give away anything, so I'll just say that Benicio does an out of place character change in the middle of the film, and goes back to his initial character. The other thing that bothered me was the love interest. Another situation where the couple just kind of fall for each other with no real development. On that note of development, there wasn't really any character development, every character starts the same, and ends the same. They had the whole movie to develop, and they just flat out didn't. I didn't hate the characters, I just didn't care for them.Now that is out of the way, let me tell you what I thought was good. The scenery is awesome, the full moon definitely adds to the mood of the film. The special effects weren't bad either, I was kind of expecting a bit more, but they weren't bad at all, especially compared to An American Werewolf in Paris. The transformation scenes were fun to watch, as they are always kind of the key scenes in Werewolf movies. Anthony Hopkins was great in this film, he was definitely the right choice for his character. He's so good at being dark and mysterious, he always leave you wondering what's going to happen next. I liked that the movie was a time period film. Having the film set in the 1800's definitely helped the dark mood of the film. The mood of the film did have that "classic" film feel, but with more gore. The gore was awesome, there enough of it without it being too gory. And I liked the ending, not giving anything away, but it leaves you wondering. ;) All in all, I didn't hate the film, but I didn't exactly like it either. I guess it's really up to the person who watches it. I give it a 6/10, because like I said, didn't hate, but didn't love it either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mixed bag of a film with enjoyment moments of violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Victorian England seems to be a gold mine for the film industry with many recent films set in that period: Sweeney Todd, Sherlock Holmes, The Prestige and Burke and Hare being examples. Universal have also decided to look at this period with a remake of it 40s horror film The Wolfman and hope to repeat the success of The Mummy.In 1891 Ben Talbot (Simon Merrells) is murdered by a mysterious creature in a English wood. His actor brother Lawrence (Benicio Del Toro) returns to his family home after receiving a letter from his brother's fiancée Gwen (Emily Blunt). Whilst looking for Ben's killer Lawrence is also attacked by the same creature and ends up suffering from the werewolf curse. Lawrence has to combat the beast within him, his father (Anthony Hopkins) with his own secrets and the Scottish Yard inspector Abberline (Hugo Weaving) who is hunting him.The Wolfman went through development hell. Mark Romanek was going to direct it but left, with Joe Johnston stepping in at the last minute. It was film that had to go through 40 days of pick-up shots, which is about half a film shoot and its release date was pushed back to February 2010, a dead zone for major film releases. Johnston is a perfectly servable director, he is a man who gets the job done and I did enjoy his film Jumanji when I was a child. But with the Wolfman there seems to be a little bit of a disconnect between him and the actors, Johnston seem to want to make a dark Gothic film whilst the actors treaded it as a cheese-fest. The art-direction and dark cinematography were expertly done to give a film a Gothic look and I liked the way the werewolf moved and strike. The film was at its best when it there was a large amount of violence with limps and heads being ripped off. Danny Elfman's score works best when the werewolf is attacking people. Johnston also shows that innocent people do get attack. Some elements of the film reminds me of Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula, a Gothic historical set horror film that even has scenes in a mental asylum. It was very similar in tone and style.The problem for me is with an undeveloped script and some weak casting choices. Many of the actors were obviously have fun whilst making the film like in the pub. Anthony Hopkins was in the film to chew up the scenery and give a strange cross between an English and Irish accent. Hugo Weaving gives his usual slightly sinister performance but he is best performer in the film: he is simply a police officer trying to protect the public. Emily Blunt tries to treat the film more seriously and tries to show that there is some depth of grief and love in her character. She is a sensitive soul who has to do the important, but whilst Blunt does an okay job I personally think she is a little overrated as an actress. Del Toro is the weakest link in the cast. He has proved himself before in many films, but he was miscast in The Wolfman. He could not do an English accent so the writers made out he was raised in America and he gives a lukewarm performance and it seems that he was in The Wolfman for a nice paycheck.Praise has to go to Rick Baker: he is one of the best make-up artists in the business. He makes an effective looking werewolf with fangs, claws and hair. Some people have been critical that he gave the werewolf a flat face but I actually like the classic look to the wolfman, making him a hybrid between a man and a wolf.An uneven film that does have some fun moments.5.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't have any high expectations for this movie when I saw the trailer for it, but didn't think it would be too bad. Well I can just say I got what I expected out of it, in a good way. The special effects are well done, but the characters in this just wasn't that interesting. The make-up wasn't done well either and just came off obvious. The only actor that stood out somewhat was Hugo Weaving, although the other actors tried to do the best with what they have. The story just goes in a direction where most audience would assume it would go or at least I did for the most part. The parts with Hopkins was okay as well, but overall it's sort of a bland movie with nothing really memorable. Everything just seemed rush and it could probably been more than mediocre of there was more development.6.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anthony Hopkins, Bencio Del Toro, Geraldine Chaplin, Hugo Weaving... The 19th century London... The wolfman has them all and does a great job. The dark, intensive, aggressive tone of the film, its hectic pace never let you down or saddened. The plot is a bit trite and at times predictable, hence only 7 out of 10. But apart from that, this is a stunning film with great actors and very thrilling line. I loved the excellent stream of the plot and never felt any boredom. Benicio is very convincing, be he a man or a wolf. Yes, Mr. Hopkins is a bit obscure at times, but he does know how to make it big and true. Geraldine Chaplin is another great star as a Gypsy woman who makes it real great. I highly recommend this good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed but decent movie/horror/Werewolf...thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First the Good: Acting was great, I mean how could one go wrong with Anthony Hopkins? I don't think I have ever seen him do a bad job. Emily Blunt was just fine in her role, and I have always liked Hugo weaving.The Movie is pretty good at making the audience jump, if one is in the mood. There are two scenes, out of many, that I found particularly scary, and since a movie can make me ( an avid movie watcher who shy's away from nothing) scared, well then I say bravo to the film.Now the Bad: Did I say the acting was great? Let me rephrase. Most of the acting was great. I hate to say this, because I like most if not all of his work, but Del Toro's lines were stiff, as if he was playing a guy from another planet trying to fit in with Victorian England's upper establishment. His words were, and again I hate to say this, but they were the exact copy of an under acting bad actor, it was almost robotic. (no disrespect) He looked great in the film, everything visually about Del Toro was good, but how he spoke his lines...and really I tried convincing myself that, Del Toro is one of those actors; He's weird, he's out there in his art form, etc....no.It was not good acting.Moving on, The CG work was weak, weak at best. For a classic to be remade I would want to shell out the extra cash to try and make the CENTRAL FIGURE IN MY FILM look great, not "made for TV movie" type CG. I saw better CG in the Hulk almost 10 years ago. Oh yes and CG bears....really? They couldn't find a real bear to act they had to waste everyone's time with a CG bear and CG Elk or deer or whatever. I mean I laughed when I saw that.Oh well, I think if one is not expecting much, and one is in the mood to be scared, and one can not mind the cheese factor just a little, (and this is a lot of 'and's') then watch this. Otherwise don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable, entertaining film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great cast,a great costume design and a classic horror story is all that you can really ask for in a werewolf movie, and that is exactly what The Wolfman director Joe Johnston brings in The Wolfman. The Wolfman is about an American man, who returns to his home town in England after his brother's untimely death.Benicio Del Toro plays the main character, Lawrence Talbot, and Anthony Hopkins plays his father. Emily Blunt does well as her role as Gwen Conliffe, a woman with whom Lawrence Talbot develops a romantic relationship with. But for me the real star of The Wolfman was Hugo Weaving, who did outstandingly well in his role as an inspector.The Wolfman is undoubtedly one of the most entertaining and enjoyable horror movies that I have ever seen and I felt that The Wolfman managed to keep me entertained throughout the whole duration of the movie. There is also a substantial amount of blood and gore in this film. For me this contributed to making The Wolfman the enjoyable film that it is. Unfortunately, The Wolfman fails to be scary, but luckily, I found The Wolfman to be such a good film, that it did not matter to me that it was not scary.The Wolfman is great film, and in my opinion the best werewolf movie up to date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Dark, Excellent cinematography and set direction, nice movie not gr8.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The performances in the movie were absolutely fantastic. Benicio Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Hugo Weaving, and Emily Blunt all delivered and really brought their characters to life. It's always good to have great performances in a horror/action film. Everything seems genuine and all of the characters are very engaging. The set pieces and cinematography are all beautifully created. There's a lot of eye candy in this film just as far as the sets are concerned, and I really love the atmosphere this film created. The music is also pretty unique and memorable. I rarely comment on the score of a film, but this one really had some great music. Some other things that impressed me were the action sequences and the 'kills'. The action sequences are pretty exciting and they'll keep you at the edge of your seat. Just when you think it's safe... something crazy happens and mayhem ensues. The 'kills' are also pretty awesome. The werewolf in this film is pretty insane, so expect to see a lot of blood, gore, and human body parts flying around all over the place. The violence, along with the dark atmosphere, really gave a suspenseful experience. Overall, The Wolfman is a fun horror/action film. The acting is great, the sets and visuals are awesome, and the action sequences are pretty cool. There are also some pretty nice kills in this one for all of you blood/gore fans. While the film can be fun, the plot suffers from the film's inconsistent pacing, which eventually leaves some plot holes. Trust me, the trailer makes this flick seem a lot cooler than it actually is. Just eat your popcorn and leave your mind at home...it's just brainless fun. it was of course visually appealing but the movie itself was not that great. could have been much better. i don't have any problem with the slow movement of the film but the screenplay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the request of his brother's fiancée, a man investigates the disappearance and then death of his brother who shared an estate with their father in some old provincial town.This movie boasts very realistic-looking transformations and very good, violent, action. --By the way, the villain from The Matrix is in it (sight for sore eyes). Also in it is the serial killer from Silence of the Lambs. What a combo! They should do battle. Who would win? I'll put my money on the serial killer. He'd find a way to carve up that bullet-dodging virtual f*ck. Okay, okay, childishness aside, Anthony Hopkins is a great actooor and presents his usual laid back, effortless, confident style. Most of the others are strangers to me but they're okay. Good movie, don't miss.Finally, before I sign off, I gotta ask: If you could be a werewolf or vampire, which would you choose? Consider: The werewolf is a tactless, violent-for-the-sake-of-being-violent s.o.b, and not himself. The vampire, many of them anyway (depending on which movie you see), is a smooth, cunning, predator; is very much him or herself and can pass among humans. I'll take the vampire. I have no desire to run around shirtless and crazy in the woods. Love, Boloxxxi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expecting much(?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, that the whole developing story and the whole negative energy surrounding the movie, almost made me not wanting to see this. It seemed to be so bad, that the question would be: Why bother? A director had gone AWOL to do something else (even if there was no "bad blood" as everyone says, excuse the pun), a new one got hired, the production got delayed, re-shoots this, re-shoots that. How could this even be remotely any good then? I can't tell you how or even if it is to you. I can only say, that I genuinely liked the movie. That has much to do with the visual aspect of the movie of course (great cinematography, vivid pictures) and with the score of the movie. I really dug that too. Of course without the actors, none would be possible and especially Anthony Hopkins did the most of his screen-time/-role.I know that some people did dread del Toro subtle approach to the role, but I thought it was a great counter part to Hopkins, who's character might be low key too, but very extravagant nevertheless.While I'm writing this, I should have told you, that it's been too long since I have seen he original Wolf Man, so even if I wanted to compare those movies I couldn't. And though I normally dread remakes, I think this has a life of it's own. It's almost a shame, it got bashed, before it even got out. And I only have seen the theatrical cut so far. There is an extended cut available on disc of course.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Remake. Not Scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>London stage actor Lawrence Talbot (Del Toro) goes home to Blackmoor to determine how his brother was killed.This is a remake of a movie I was afraid to watch when I was a kid. I didn't want to see it now either for the same reasons. This time I was told this is not a scary movie. I watched it on a bright sunny day anyway. Turns out it was not scary at all, and actually, the only thing that made me jump was the music designed for those moments when you let your guard down. There were too many of those designed moments and not all were necessary. It got so I knew when they were coming. Jumped anyway. And, for a remake of a classic horror story, the music was NOT distinctive and it should have been. The cinematography almost rivals that of Bram Stoker's Dracula. Very good. The acting by the rest of the cast and CGI were also very good. I guess that is why they do remakes. Now they have CGI to play with. Benicio Del Toro and Anthony Hopkins are pure gold in this. I was hoping for more dialogue from Del Toro. Hopkins, as Sir John Talbot, had his usual say and, of course, his dialogues were so calculating that you knew there was something more about him than what Lawrence saw. Emily Blunt (as Gwen) was good as the wife of the Lawrence's deceased brother. And, anytime Del Toro has a love scene or an almost love scene the chemistry with the woman is a given. And, it showed here too. Del Toro has that effect on women as my tabloid bibles, the Inquirer, Star, and Globe write about. The only thing I could not figure out was what did the Gypsy woman Maleva (Chaplin) tell Gwen that would help Gwen help Lawrence. Gwen goes running off, on a horse, to administer the information or whatever to Lawrence and we see none of it. This was a loose end with no closure. All in all a good remake that was not scary, not bloody, great acting and again the cinematography was truly outstanding. Yes, it was a little too long, but??????.Violence; Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not cool but it is good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joe Johnstone's remake of the 1941 horror classic was a box-office bomb; Made on a budget of $150 million, the film managed to scrape back a peasy-assed $140 million-ish at the cinemas (that's worldwide, mind).The film seemed cursed (pun, as always, intended) before it's release as stories of directorial changes and production delays held the film up. Upon release the film met indifferent reviews and quickly disappeared from public conscience; but for some reason I felt an urge to give it a go.Maybe it was because I thought it would be good to see Benicio Del Toro headlining a 'mainstream' movie or maybe it was the fact the brilliant original is still the benchmark of werewolf movies but still old and quaintly archaic enough to warrant a 're-imagining'.Upon watching it's very easy to understand why the film failed to find an audience. The style of the movie is reminiscent of the Gothic spookiness of recent family friendly horror-lite such as Van Helsing or the Twilight series but the film contains enough blood, viscera and gore to warrant it's 15 certificate (R in the US). Though this was an attempt to give the film some much needed credence in the horror genre (the original is, after all, a pioneer of terror) compare it to the current swathe of 'torture-porn', the SAW movies and their copycat offspring and The Wolfman seems tame, like almost, well, a kid's movie.Away from the current trends of modern horror, The Wolfman stands out as a very entertaining, old-school, blood-and-guts romp. That's right, you heard me, 'ROMP'. You don't see enough films these days being referred to as 'romps'... But, I digress, whereas a lot of fantasy films these days have decided to maintain an air of po-faced seriousness, The Wolfman is a film that is aware of it's own sense of silliness and this undoubtedly is, in my opinion, a good thing.With each wolf-attack sequence seemingly trying to tick off an inventory of 'cool and creative ways of killing people' the action sequences, despite the odd bit of 'see-the-lines' CG are well-shot and superbly edited together.The style and tone of the film is impressive, with some tasty Gothic set design and a decent amount of creepy forests at night. The film's makers made a good decision to keep the film as a period piece as opposed to setting it in the modern day. It resembles an early Tim Burton film with creative use of shadows and colour (it also has a Danny Elfman score which adds to the Burton-esqueness) The acting is largely spot-on too, Del Toro maintains an air of tortured menace throughout, Emily Blunt does a good job despite her character being dragged out to show a bit of side-boob and offer a sympathetic ear to our titular monster and very little else. However, Anthony Hopkins and Hugo Weaving seem to be more than aware of the type of film they're making and are both clearly hamming it all the way to the bank, which benefits the film immensely.The film successfully updates the original without tarnishing the memory of the Universal horror classic, it largely maintains the same story as the original and keeps the same characters and is a worthy addition to the Werewolf sub-genre.The Wolfman is a rare treat, a piece of brainless escapism that keeps the audience gripped from start to finish, anyone with half a brain will spot the plot twists a mile off but that doesn't matter. It won't tax the brain or change the way you think about life and it won't have you thinking about it for any time afterwards but it succeeds in being an entertaining, dark and thrilling horror romp.That's right..... Romp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't hold my attention the whole time, but worth watching anyway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've decided to at last review The Wolfman, directed by Joe Johnston.It lacked the charm of older supernatural movies, but offered a modern take, and the atmosphere was mildly reminiscent of Sleepy Hollow.Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro made great performances, and had obvious chemistry. Needless to say Anthony Hopkins was on usual top form.Best Parts: 1) In the forest when Del Toro (in wolf form) catches up with the gentleman stuck in a bog, the man tries to shoot himself in the head before Del Toro kills him painfully, but there are no bullets left, so he has his head savagely sliced off by the wolfman.2) I loved the trippy montage within the asylum.Visually impressive, well cast and atmospheric, but it didn't grip my attention the whole time, and I am still trying to work out exactly why. It felt like there was an ingredient missing, or perhaps it was just too long, like not enough butter stretched over too much bread. The plot twists did not feel very surprising, and I do not think the film offered anything new to me. Still, I don't have any serious complaints, and think it's worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of a classic tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joe Johnston directs this remake of the 1941 classic. The original has been altered big time, but this version can hold its own. Benico del Toro plays Lawrence Talbot, a well known Shakespearean actor performing Hamlet in London. Talbot is informed by his brother's fiancé(Emily Blunt)of his disappearance. Upon arriving at his family estate Lawrence is told by his estranged father(Anthony Hopkins)his brother's body was found viciously mauled. Drinkers in the local pub want to place blame on gypsies camped on the outskirts of town. After Talbot talks to a gypsy queen he gets the impression recent killings were actually the attacks of a werewolf. As anticipated Lawrence survives an attack himself...only to deal with the curse of being bitten. Supporting cast includes: Hugo Weaving, Geraldine Chaplin, Elizabeth Croft and Art Malik. Photography and F/X are commendable and the atmosphere is enhanced by the music of the outstanding Danny Elfman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're ready for a gruesome, gory bloodfest, rent this movie. The environment is very dark and gloomy, how you would expect for a movie involving a werewolf to take place. The story progresses as anyone would expect without any crazy twists or turns. Anyone that has common sense and is an educated guesser can predict event after event. Just because the movie is predictable, doesn't mean it wasn't well done. All the actors within the film act prefectly to their corresponding roles and make you believe in their characters. The highlight of the movie is the extreme goriness and the unforgiving relentlessness of the wolfman. This is definitely a film to watch once, so a rental is perfect. Admire it while you're in the moment because there's no real reason to go back and watch it again. (Except for the gory scenes)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never saw the original film although no one can say I live in a cave because I wasn't born yet when the original came out, I did however see this film directed by Joe Johnston whose other credits include THE ROCKETTEER and JUMANJI and the script was co-written by Andrew Kevin Walker who also penned the popular 90's psychological thriller SEVEN.THE WOLFMAN was actually a lot of fun to watch, there were plenty of thrills and jumps, some great make up effects, as well as great performances from the lead actors Benecio Del Toro, Emily Blunt and Anthony Hopkins but despite all that this film doesn't really stand out, by that I mean the effects are nothing groundbreaking, the storyline isn't too predictable except for when it gets started you know what'll happen to the lead character at a latter stage, the reason I would recommend this film is that it does entertain, you certainly won't get bored that I can guarantee but its no milestone in film making.Overall, you can do worse and you can do better, the only reason to see this film is for its entertainment value, that is if you don't spend the whole film running comparisons with the original, I haven't seen it like I said but I discovered it works like that with every remake, because in the end whether you watch the original or the remake, you're still watching two different films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>be sure to see the unrated version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not going to compare this remake with the original one. The original one is from 1941, how could you ever compare it with the techniques used nowadays. The classic one clocked in at 70 minutes, this one clocks in at two hours. Is it as bad as most reviewers said it was. Well, to be honest, after reading all the negativity I guessed I would have a yawn or two watching it but surprised as I was I didn't. But let me say that I have seen the unrated version and not the theatrical version. There is a difference of 16 minutes and I could guess that the gory parts were left out of it. Just now it is in Europe available on DVD and Blu Ray and clocks in at 98 minutes (DVD) 102 minutes (Blu Ray), already extended!! So that's almost 22 minutes shorter! If you would like the full uncut catch one overseas. By doing so I could see all the work Rick Baker did with it. Baker surely did ring a bell, he was the man behind the special effects of An American Werewolf In London. His dream was to make another werewolf transformation and once he noticed that there was a remake of The Wolf Man on the stake he went for it. But 2010 isn't 1981. We have a lot of CGI but still some gory parts are old school. He really did some fine work. All actors are believable and the storyline is good too, it really follows the classic movie and okay, the gypsy isn't that important but hey, that was more than 60 years ago. Due the use of CGI and especially the scene's at London when the werewolf is running didn't do the movie any good, it reminded me of The Hulk, I'm sorry to say that. It's a nice flick to see, full unrated, for everyone who wants to see a romantic story, and who isn't these days with the Twilight saga. But to say that it will become as classic as the 1992 remake of Dracula, that will never happen. But still, it's a slow starter (takes exact one hour before the werewolf appears) but one surely to watch...at full moon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Standard Werewolf Fare; No Improvement On The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As werewolf movies go, this was pretty standard and didn't add very much to the genre. In fairness, it shouldn't be expected to "add" very much, I suppose. It is, after all, a remake of a classic - the 1941 version of the movie starring Lon Chaney. I always have mixed feelings when classic movies are remade, and usually find the remakes disappointing. In terms of writing a review, that means this movie has to be specifically looked at in comparison to the earlier version while at the same time considered in light of more modern versions of the werewolf legend.The story is very similar to the '41 movie. Set in 1891, Lawrence Talbot returns to England from America and gets caught up in a hideous nightmare after being attacked by the same creature that has already killed his brother. Even the gypsies are present. What made the classic Universal horror films from the 30's and early 40's classics was the use of the proper atmosphere. There was an attempt to hold on to that tradition with this. The scenes and sets seem appropriate and create an uneasiness for the viewer. On the other hand, this being 2010 the movie is much bloodier and more violent than the '41 version - a reflection of the modern tendency in such movies to replace "fright" with "gore." There is, indeed, gore galore in this version. Other differences revolve around some of the characters. Talbot's father (played by Anthony Hopkins) has a more prominent place and is a very different character than that played by Claude Rains in 1941 (this Talbot is a very mysterious and suspicious character indeed) and the character of the gypsy woman Maleva seemed more believable in 1941 (Maria Ouspenskaya handled the part better than did Geraldine Chaplin.) Other differences were more technical in nature. Special effects today are more advanced, so the primitive "transformation" scenes of '41 are replaced by far more believable transformation scenes, although the transformations are pretty routine by today's standards and don't really provide any shock.What worked well? The transformation in front of the doctors at the asylum. Lawrence had been committed there and was going to be brought out of his delusion of being a monster by being put in a restraining chair in front of the doctors during a full moon to prove to him that he wasn't a werewolf. That didn't work out as planned! The chase through the rooftops of London was pretty good, and the battle near the end between the two werewolves (Talbot's and the one that killed his brother) was brief but well executed. What didn't work well was the very predictable "twist" in the story. Unlike the '41 version we're going to learn the identity of the original werewolf. Unfortunately, you figure out who it is pretty early on, so mystery is lacking. As far as performances go, in all honesty Benecio Del Toro is no Lon Chaney, Jr. Chaney did a much better job of capturing the fear, bewilderment and anguish of Talbot coming to terms with what he's becoming than Del Toro did. Hopkins was fine as Talbot, Sr., but was primarily there to be a big name - another actor could have pulled the part off easily enough. One also hopes that the producers don't follow up on the opening for a sequel left at the end, as the inspector from Scotland Yard is bitten but not killed. This really wasn't good enough to warrant a sequel, but of course if Universal figures it can make money out of one, one will appear in due course.As werewolf movies go, this was OK. There are both better and worse ones out there. If you like werewolf movies, you'll probably like this. If you don't, it won't be of much interest to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violent, bloody love story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in 1800s London and the English manor, "The Wolfman" is based on the myth that 'Wolfmen', more commonly caller 'Werewolves', are among us. They make their transformation at full moon and they try to destroy, at least in the movie, everything in sight.While I found most of it interesting, I also found much of it over done. Lots of violence with blood and gore. Decapitations, disembowelments, arms and legs torn off and tossed aside. The basic story was good enough that so much gore was not needed and in fact detracted from the movie's overall quality.Anthony Hopkins is nobleman Sir John Talbot with a large estate, but when we first see it inside it appears to be unkempt. In an early scene his son, Simon Merrells as Ben Talbot, if found in the woods dead and disfigured. So the brother, Benicio Del Toro as Lawrence Talbot, a thespian in America, returns home and vows to stay there until the mystery of Ben's death is solved. The other key character is Emily Blunt as Gwen Conliffe, who was the fiancée' of Simon.SPOILERS: I saw this coming about midway in the movie, but Sir John is a Werewolf and it actually was him who killed his own son. He also bit Lawrence who became a Werewolf also. In the end there is a showdown between the two and the younger prevails. But Gwen had fallen love with Lawrence and as she was cornered in the woods by the werewolf, tried to get him to recognize her. Failing at that she shot him with a silver bullet and, as he lay beside her dying she watched the werewolf change back into Lawrence. A Scotland Yard man who had been bitten in the fray is looking at the shrouded full moon as the movie ends, perhaps he will continue the legend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From time to time a movie comes out that you have to see on the big screen. Wolfman was one of those for me. I read the reviews, which I usually don't care to read. There was a lot of criticism on Iron Man and I really enjoyed that movie. A couple of fools with an agenda put down Edge of Darkness and I thought it was great. Which leads us to The Wolfman. The critics really destroyed this one but at the same time in order to be political correct, they skated around the truth of the matter. None of them liked it and they said that the lead guy Del toro didn't do a good job or wasn't believable but they just should have gotten to the point. He looks like a Mexican guy from Los Angeles who stands outside of a home depot looking for day work or maybe a Spanish guy from Da Bronx who works down at the tire shop. Before you wave the political correct flag, save it for someone who is dumb enough to buy into the smoke screen. If you're going to make the mom in the movie look of Latin Heritage to allow yourself to hire an actor to be of Latin descent, then fine. But can't you find a guy who can carry himself as if he is born of English class? His father's Anthony Hopkins, for crying out loud. The apple doesn't fall that far from the tree. There isn't an actor of Latin descent out there who could have been more comfortable in nice clothing for 90 minutes. This isn't about being a hater, this is about getting an opportunity to have a non white-bred actor have an opportunity to step up and do a solid for his people. And this is what they give us.

		<fullReview>In this remake of the classic Universal film of the same name, BENICIO DEL TORO stars as Lawrence Talbot, who arrives to the home of his youth to stay with his father (Played wonderfully by ANTHONY HOPKINS) following his brothers horrible death, by what appears to be done by an insane lunatic or a wild beast. One night he is bitten by what appears to be a very large wolf or something that resembles one &amp; soon finds himself changing into a hideous werewolf creature by the light of the full moon who promptly disposes of anyone or anything, he comes across while travelling through the town, or in the woods, having seemingly no memory of what he has done when he changes back to human form &amp; more frighteningly, no memories of the people he knows when he's in wolf form, causing many of his friends &amp; enemies, to be ripped to shreds. Soon the woman he loves learns from an elderly gypsy woman that the werewolf curse is irreversible &amp; the only way to end the terror is death &amp; what's worse, besides Lawrence learning the truth, the heroine discovers a horrifying secret about just who the other werewolf that bit him is...THE WOLFMAN is pretty decent, though as unlike a lot of other "remakes" (see the horrible MUMMY (1999)) this one doesn't try to hide the fact that it is a horror movie &amp; isn't scared to provide horror fans with some good juicy gory bits with plenty of off the wall kills. The werewolf suits were awesome &amp; definitely resembled the original wolf man look, which I was really happy about. Another good thing this film did right was in the period setting, with a keen attention to detail resulting is some beautiful imagery &amp; sets. The cinematography was very well done here with plenty of mood &amp; atmosphere that give even some of the daylight scenes a sense of dread. The suspense &amp; kills are very well handled here &amp; the film boasts some spectacularly good acting &amp; directing as well. That aside, the film does have some flaws, most notably the films overlong running time, which could have (&amp; should have) been cut shorter to make a stronger tighter thrill ride that I felt would have worked better simply because the film at times does tend to drag on in places &amp; the films supposed "twist" should come to no surprise to anyone who has seen their fare share of horror flicks. In short, I think what else impressed me about the movie, was the fact that for once you actually got the feeling both while watching the movie &amp; after viewing it, that you've seen a good horror movie, not a great horror movie mind you, but a pretty darn good one. Unlike a lot of remakes done for the greed factor that really shows in all areas of production, you can see with this film that the studio &amp; film- makers actually cared for the material &amp; wanted to put out the best film they could for genre fans &amp; the film definitely earn my respect on that level. Thankfully Universal learned their lesson after the horrible MUMMY 1999 &amp; it's two just as bad &amp; as boring sequels, &amp; made up for those horrible mistakes with this one. Highly recommended to fans of the original Universal classic, STEPHEN SOMMERS &amp; BRENDAN FRASER can keep their lousy Mummy "remake" THE WOLFMAN is a real &amp; honest remake of the classic that I want to see!***1/2 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Have Been...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a would have, could have, should have been. This has always been a wonderful story among the Gothic romances (the three standouts being Dracula, Frankenstein, and Wolfman) but definitely the most difficult one to interpret. The Gothic romantic horrors are difficult as they are overblown and melodramatic. Writing these can come off as laughable soap opera all too easily. They are love stories first and foremost with antiheroes in the forefront. Our romantic lead turns into a wolf and eats people (hardly a winning quality on Lavalife) yet we are to root for him and the tragedy that has befallen him. In this film we do. The script is weak to be sure but it is strong enough and held up by a stellar cast (although I think that Anthony Hopkins only plays Hannibal Lechter anymore) that we do want the Wolfman to overcome and win. Visually, the movie is spectacular. It is beautiful to watch. So what's wrong? It's boring. This movie is flawed. In spite of all that I have said it fails to grip you. There is no tension. It is overlong and tedious. At it's best, it is visually stimulating but at it's worst, it is celluloid Nyquil. Too bad. Could have been great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this in the theaters, I was amazed how they preserved the story of the Wolfman while amping up the kill and gore factor. The results are so-so. More action, CGI, and tons of Makeup by Rick Baker make this a decent horror film, the only good one out there this year and a good remake. It would've been better if Hugh Jackman played the Wolfman. Emily Blunt is amazing as the girl who gets chased by the monster. The score by Danny Elfman is haunting, and there are tons of chills and thrills. Much better than another Universal horror remake, Van Helsing, and hopefully they make another R-rated remake of other popular Universal monsters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wolfman Remade With CGI Effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Benicio Del Toro stars as Lawrence Talbot in director Joe Johnson's remake of the original Wolfman film from Universal Pictures. Lon Chaney Jr. starred in the original, and for some reason, the movers and shakers found it necessary to cast an actor who strongly resembles Chaney. While the original film was atmospheric, exciting, fun, and well-paced, the new film is darkly atmospheric with characters dressed in wonderful costumes of the era. The new film is also full of computer generated images, some of which are quite bad and obvious, as well as as a tacked on sub plot that did not exist in the earlier film. Del Toro is good as the contemplative and troubled Talbot, if not always convincing. The part of Gwen Conliffe is well played by Emily Blunt. Sir Anthony Hopkins adds a little craziness as Sir John Talbot. Hugo Weaving is somewhat pedestrian in the thankless role of Abberline. Geraldine Chaplin is not on the screen nearly enough as the gypsy fortune teller Maleva who spouts the infamous "even a man who is pure in heart" jingle at the beginning. The strengths of the film are the atmosphere, art and set decoration, and costumes and perhaps Emily Blunt's character: Gwen Conliffe. The weaknesses are some of the much too obvious computer generated images and the predictable battle that occurs at the end. Master make up artist Rick Baker appears in a couple bits. **1/2 of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of the classic horror film The Wolfman will certainly be looked down upon by many fans and critics today as its excessive violence and gore don't relate well in creating true suspense and terror. Indeed, this has to be one of the most violent films of the last few years and all it does is simply make you cringe and notice how well-done the makeup was.However, I cannot deny that this was a film in some ways worthy of its attempt to be the bridge between the classic horror films of the 1930s and 40s and today's hyper-violent, extreme way of creating terrifying sequences. The best parts of the film, fortunately, were the two main actors. Anthony Hopkins brings a mysterious elegance to every role and here he creates a character kind of like a spin-off from his character in Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula(a much better film by the way). But, the casting of Benicio del Toro as the tormented actor-turned hairy beast Lawrence Talbot was a very good move. Del Toro's ability to create a somewhat sympathetic and interesting character certainly saved a lot of face for this film, which by the final act consists of constant CGI effects getting in the way of the story trying to create real uneasiness.There were problems, but I must say that the good outweighs the bad in this case. Emily Blunt is fine in her supporting role, though underused, and Hugo Weaving is terrific as the relentless Inspector Aberline from Scotland Yard. I can't say I fully enjoyed this movie, but if you're in the mood for a very gory action feast with a few startling moments, The Wolfman delivers on a basic level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie , just a few details that I disagree: first of all, I am from Romania and I don't agree that the gypsies in the movie were speaking Romanian because here, in my country , their language isn't Romanian, they speak totally another language, they use Romanian only to beg , so that we could understand them. I consider that an offense to the Romanian people. And secondly, for the people who don't know Romanian, what you probably think that at the end of the movie there's some chronicles written in Romanian, let me tell you that those are only some recipes for sweets( LOL for that ). Anyway, the action was great, watch it in HD , the blood is more real that way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comes up short where it counts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though well produced and well casted, comes across as an overwrought and reaching attempt to make a classic out of a legend that no one has yet adequately recounted. The downfall of this movie is that there is yet no explanation behind the origin of the curse. There is no meaning behind the film other than mindless killing and fear-mongering. A true classic demands a sense of purpose and this film utterly fails to bring any sense of that to bear.Part of the problem with werewolf films in general is the identity of the beast itself. The main reason why none of them ever do more than frighten young children is because there is no classic literary work from which to draw reference, such as Bram Stoker's Dracula. The difference between this sub-genre and the other "classics" is a distinct lack of inference to a more human story behind the monster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another lame remake (please stop already, okay Hollywood?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the sad shape it's in, I think the last thing Hollywood needed was another remake. Yet, I'm hearing about more and more of them all the time. Having a feeling that this remake of the 1941 classic "The Wolfman" would be a disappointment, I decided to give it a shot anyway, so I watched it. Basically what this film is is a CGI free for all disguised as a dramatic monster movie. The scenes where The Wolfman (Benicio Del Toro) is terrorizing the village are fun, but were filled with cheap shocks,and the CGI was terrible. It felt like I was watching someone play a video game that has only slightly more dialog than average. It's sad that today's horror audiences are only interested in blood and gore. In the old one, only a few people are killed, while in this one, countless people are slaughtered before our very eyes. This would be okay if the carnage was very realistic, but it wasn't. This brings me back to the CGI. Every scene with CGI gore effects looks terrible. For example, there is a scene where two werewolves fight. Was that supposed to be scary or something? It just looks silly to me. Maybe this would have entertained me at the age of 13, but I'm a bit older now, and I can see this movie is broken down into two scenes. 1.) The Wolfman mutilating and killing people, and 2.) Benicio Del Toro having dramatic conversations with one or two of the other cast members. The sad thing is, the sets look good, and the acing is good too. It's like the producers of this film said "We're going to make a very formal looking film, but we're still going to have stupid looking cgi effects that make it look like a superhero movie!" In closing, if you want my advice, stick with the classic 40's version. It's not quite as violent, but it is written well, and it doesn't have cheesy CGI effects that will be outdated in two years. Crepe hair and monster makeup never get old, guaranteed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Father-absent series: The Wolfman.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With two striking genius as the leads(Both won Oscar), Visual effects geek Joe Johnston as the director, The Wolfman entered our sights with its 1930 roots of gentlemen-ship, new millennium gore and very primitive brutality. However, the highlight was still the twisted father-son relationship.This is a review written under "Father-absence" theme, please also find my other reviews in this series to get an insight into Asians' perceptions on popular movies.All the classic monster movies got this birthmark, that the idea is conceived, inspired by absence of fathers/bad fathers in real life. Frankenstein was a story of "sins of the father's" which is told in a forwarded/futuristic narration. Dracula movies usually features a Dracula who likes to pretend being a loving father, yet featuring religious fanatics of Christianity as worst villains. "Interview with the Vampire" features everlasting homosexual "love" and a failed attempt to be a father figure. However, so far there's no movies like The Wolfman that directly writes the father-son relationship into such an escalating catastrophe. Guess the werewolf movies are all mirrors to our bloodthirsty natures/craziness/sins in a way.Into the 20th century, Darwinism was just at its dawn to overtake half the scientific world as well as spiritual. Early mechanics and technique in treating psychological disorders were also introduced, while the Church and the protestants strive to maintain their voices in this shape-shifting world. Caught up in the middle were the Gypsies who neither gave in to spiritual resorts provided by churches nor succumb to scientific mindsets that translate the whole world into mechanisms. Out of his passion to save his little brother, celebrated actor Lawrence Talbot traveled back to the gritty homeland where his estranged father awaited for him. He tracked down his brother's murderer into the Gypsy camp, where a mysterious creature with big fangs wrecked havocs around ripping a lot people apart. Bitten by this monster, Lawrence found himself gradually transforming into a werewolf as the moon reaches full. Deliberately releasing him in the night of final transformation, his suspicious father turned him in to the bureaus. Finally revealing his status as the werewolf that killed his own wife, Laurence's mother, Old Talbot invited his son for a final duel at home...... In the meantime, the beautiful Gwen also set out for the cure/redemption for her beloved Laurence.Other than an extraordinary tolerance to gore, you will need the ability to read between the lines to understand what The Wolfman tries to tell you. It is quite an interesting illustration of a splitting world that will never make the same sense again. No matter which lot they represent, the mob are always ignorant, unorganized and downright vulnerable. They can neither get a grasp of what's going on nor get the final answer to the origins of this curse/craziness/sins/anomaly, despite their unique claims to do so. Yet at the core of the movie, the old father repeatedly quotes the "Prodigal son parable" from New Testament. He had every due rights to call his son a "prodigal son" as the traditionally-upheld father(ancestor), yet ruthlessly passing on his sins/disease/curse/craziness to his poor family. Walking on water, the young widow set up a temporary alliance with the Gypsies, the only group who provided help and some goodwill of "saving grace". It's interesting that the story verified Gypsies and Gwen's love for Lawrence because despite they don't present any ideology, their love and compassion were both humble. Unlike Gwen and the Gypsy woman, the other groups were all holding up their own egos, just like any organized religion/group/party like to uphold "flags of their fathers". In this sense, the movie is not only illustrating the father-absence status of the 20th century, the movie's even rationalizing it with the notion of women's ability to pass on the only ultimate goodness, favorably the pagan goodness in an esoteric pattern. I haven't seen the original 1941 version, but I can surely tell it must have been quite an achievement among other post-modern stories that struggle to seek purity, clarity and maybe, redemption in a crazy world.This phenomenon, however, has been obstinate in the humanity. If secrecy, ambiguity in conducting and other esoteric characteristics could all be verified as "humility", then I guess one would invite evil beliefs into his/her life. In the city I live, there are thousands of fortune-tellers who make a good living on people's broken souls. As a Christian, I admit it might be unfair for one to admit and cleanse his ancestors' sins as well as the world's sins that descended upon him. Indeed, just like Lawrence we are heirs to sins/curses rather than heirs to happiness/innocence in this crazy world. However, if admitting one's sins and committing oneself to Jesus is truly the only way one can escape from being harvested by hell's fire, yelling "unfair" won't do you any good. While there's no clean getaway by simply conducting Gypsy relics, there certainly is a way to allow your soul to be saved. Besides, I haven't seen any werewolves, nor did I think people need to be monsters to be capable of monstrous deeds.</fullReview>

The sound went along with the visuals exactly as one would perceive it I've re-watched that scene several times. The make-up appeared realistic. If there's anything I dislike, it is fake looking make-up. The creatures and metamorphoses were realistic. The choice of actors was appropriate, especially Bernicio Del Torro and Anthony Hopkins. I also liked the doctor #2 who alerts Dr. Hoennegar during the lecture. I don't buy many DVD movies. This is one I would consider. The scenery was befitting for the storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not have high hopes for this film. It's a remake (which are often not very good), and it stars Benicio del Toro and Anthony Hopkins, two actors who couldn't bear any less resemblance to each other, as father and son. Even more troubling was it's troubled production history, which included a new director and tons of re-shoots and re-edits. The latter is mostly a sign of producer interference, which is never a good sign. But after all that, the resulting movie is actually pretty enjoyable.Before I go any further, I have to admit that I have not seen the original "Wolf Man" with Lon Chaney, so comparisons to the original will not appear here.London theater actor John Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) is visited by Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt), the wife of John's brother, Ben. Ben has disappeared without a trace, and this comes after three brutal murders. Naturally, she's worried, so she has come to John for help. But John is unwilling because of a fractured relationship with his father. Nevertheless, he eventually returns home, and while there, whispers of a werewolf begin to emerge. No one takes it seriously, but John does after he's bitten.The acting is solid. Benicio Del Toro is effective as John, the protagonist. We understand his emotions, and Oscar Winner Del Toro knows what he's doing. Despite obvious deficiencies in their casting, Del Toro has terrific chemistry with each of his co-stars, especially Hopkins. Hopkins is perfect in this role, being alternately aloof and creepy. The script is well-written, but Hopkins manages to be better than it. Emily Blunt fares the best as Gwen, whose earnestness manages to tug the heartstrings. Hugo Weaving, however, is miscast, but he's not given much screen time.Joe Johnston made a number of unmemorable action pictures. They were good, but disposable. Here, Johnston's reigns are loosened (the R-rating, which he takes full advantage of, helps a lot), and he fully throws himself into the material. The first thing one recognizes is the atmosphere, which is so thick that it threatens to drown out the actors. The second is the set design, which is impeccable. Even if the film didn't have a good story or actors, the film is visually pleasing enough to be worth it. All of this is due to Johnston. Finally, there's the actual Wolfman design by master make-up artist Rick Baker. It's actually rather beautiful, in a sick and twisted way. The transformations, however, are of a different story. The CGI is unconvincing, and is reminiscent of the late summer action movies that are only eye candy (and not very good ones at that).The film gets off to a rather slow start, but it reminded me of "Brotherhood of the Wolf," which helped (although the similarities with the French film end after the first half hour). Still, this part is interesting because of its darkness. But once it hits its stride, it unleashes a number of plot twists and surprising revelations. And some creepy action sequences.In short, "The Wolf Man" is as visually pleasing and interesting as any monster movie I have seen in recent release.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having being fooled by "IMDB's" low average rating for this film and several complaints from friends who had seen it, it was safe to say my expectations going into this film were pretty low. Which is a good thing, because I actually quite enjoyed this film."Wolfman" is a Gothic horror fantasy film which is a re-make/re-imagine of a classic of which I haven't seen so I am un-able to make any comparisons which may also account to many other peoples disappointment with this adaption as it may not be as good as the original it is based on.But that's not to say it doesn't work as a stand alone feature, because it really does. The film is extremely dark in appearance and it reminded me of other films such as "Bram Stokers: Dracula" and "Sleepy Hollow". Having Danny Elfman do the music for the film helps a lot in that respect.I heard a lot of complaints that the film is slow and lacked action....what??? There is plenty of extremely violent scenes in this film that consist of limbs being torn from torso's and guts and head's ripped out/off! Lack of action? Maybe compared to the usual Hollywood Michael Bay style; "let's have an action scene continuously for 2 and a half hours and shake the camera lot's so no one can see what's actually happening!"Um...no.I've also read complaints regarding Anthony Hopkins performance. I thought he was really good. He was scary as hell which i think was aided by his aged appearance as in the older he gets the scarier he looks! Benecio Deltoro was also good as Laurence the man who becomes the Wolfman. Also noted is Hugo Weaving's performance which was quite amusing and actually quite funny (though not sure that was intentional) but the only thing is every time I see him on screen, I'm waiting for him to say "Mr Anderson"!That being said, the film is no masterpiece and I reckon lot's of people had very high expectations for this film due to the Oscar nominated cast members. The film is not scary and there is little suspense in the slower build-up scenes. The make-up effects are not the best either, as The Wolfman/men did look a little Wookie-ish which is probably due to the fact part of the effects budget was unfortunately spent on unnecessary CGI animals!Shame really, as it does bring the film down a few notches.All up a good, solid Gothic horror flick which is worth a watch especially if you enjoyed 'Dracula' and 'Sleepy Hollow'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To everyone criticizing this remake as unoriginal, I say ,"get over it!" How many fans wanting to see this film HAVEN'T seen the original? WE ALL KNOW THE STORY!!! Would anyone attending a performance of Hamlet or Macbeth really expect to see something unexpected if the cast was attempting to present the script as written? I think not. Instead we would be going to see how each cast member handles their respective roles. Personally I found none of the performances lacking. Furthermore, this ISN'T Shakespeare, it's mind candy. Don't overthink the thing, just sit back and enjoy it. If you're not a particular fan of the genre, you probably won't like it; if you are you should know better than to not appreciate it for its obvious high production values. If you're going to get overinvolved with comparisons with this cast to the looks of the original I offer this observation - if you don't think Del Toro looks enough like Chaney Jr to satisfy you, compare him with Chaney Sr. His cheekbones and jawline are greatly reminiscent of Lon Sr's most memorable characterization!! I saw it theatrically twice and have just watched the unrated version on blu ray. The expanded version is more interesting, but makes me wonder why an actor of Max Von Sydow's status got left out of the credits of that edition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Wolfman" - A fabulous-looking disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bias alert: Let me just say that I in no way expected Joe Johnston's "The Wolfman" to be a movie that I would end up liking. In an era where everything seems to be an adaptation/remake/reboot/sequel, "The Wolfman" just seemed to be the latest Hollywood quick-cash-grab, where laziness has overtaken any semblance of artistic credibility and creativity.On top of that, "The Wolf Man" (1941) is probably the greatest werewolf movie ever made; the lead character in that film, Larry Talbot, was made famous by the great Lon Chaney, Jr. My own personal favorite werewolf adventure is the landmark horror-comedy film "An American Werewolf in London" (1981), which starred David Naughton as the tragic American college student-turned-werewolf in London David Kessler, and in my opinion set a standard for special effects in horror films that has yet to be topped.In 2010, we got "The Wolfman." Of the classic Universal Pictures movie monsters, the Wolf Man was always my favorite. Werewolves are the grungiest and most tragic of those monsters because they became monsters unwillingly, and their stories always ended tragically. On top of that, these particular monsters have always been featured using some of the best special effects of their times, which also added to my love for these horrifically tragic creatures.In "The Wolfman," a bloodthirsty beast is stalking the woods and town of Blackmoor, England, in 1898. Superstitious locals believe that the gruesome murders taking place in the area are the work of a werewolf. Gloomy American stage actor Lawrence Talbot (the gloomy Benicio Del Toro) is brought back to Talbot Estate after learning of the death of his brother, where his estranged father Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins) still resides. Haunted by many childhood dramas - witnessing the death of his mother at a young age, namely - he resolves to find out what happened to his brother but in his search for answers, he meets his late brother's fiancée Gwen (Emily Blunt) and runs afoul of the mysterious Scotland Yard Inspector Abberline (Hugo Weaving, still in "Agent Smith" mode), who has been assigned to the recent spree of mutilations. To make long stories short, Lawrence finds himself bitten by the beast and learns that he is thus accursed by the mark of the werewolf, and that there is indeed "a fate worse than death.""The Wolfman" has to be one of the greatest-looking horror movies to come out in a long while. The film's cinematography is very evocative of the time and mood. Everything is washed down in a careful and hazy shade of rain, fog, clouds, moonlight, and the color blue. I admired the cinematography, production (really Gothic, huh?), and atmosphere so much that I just couldn't look away at all, no matter how much I felt that this whole thing was just some sort of cash-grabbing rehash. This is clearly one of the best and most atmospheric 19th-century England's I've ever seen in the movies. It really made me think of "The Wolf Man" from 69 years ago.The movie really has top-of-the-line actors working their way through desperately rehashed material. We know where things are going in the end, even if 2010 technology has not allowed storytelling techniques to advance any further than they should. And speaking of special effects, imagine my horror when I learned that "An American Werewolf in London" special effects legend Rick Baker was attached to this film's production as its make-up effects guy! The previews had convinced me that this new Wolf Man would be all CGI and nothing else, so imagine my surprise when this new Wolf Man is actually the work of some careful, good-old fashioned prosthetics and make-up work, in addition to good-old fashioned CGI.This new Wolf Man exists as both CGI and a man in heavy make-up. What's disappointing about the CGI is that he is rarely convincing in the scenes where he is running around and ripping people limb from limb. To paraphrase Roger Ebert's take on him, he moves around too much like a character in a live-action cartoon; "Spider-Man 2" (2004), my personal favorite superhero film and my #2 film of all time, set a standard for CGI in the movies by allowing Spider-Man to possess weight and dimension as he swung from building to building, thus making him seem "real" within the context of the film. The Wolf Man in "The Wolfman," like I stated earlier, moves to much like he exists in a comic book world, rather than the real world, because he doesn't possess the qualities that would make him seem like a real character.I think back to the transformation sequences from "The Wolf Man" and "An American Werewolf in London," where make-up effects, camera-work, clever editing, and animatronics were what allowed the werewolves in those movies to come to life and seem like real movie characters upon themselves, and they were frightening back then; the ability of the characters in those films to scare you hasn't diminished in the years it has taken them to become established movie monsters."The Wolfman" is good on its own terms. It looks fantastic, has great performances from the cast, but lacks any real depth or imagination. I guess that since I'm a sucker for werewolf movies, I had to give it a chance, despite my biases, and it does work, like I said, on its own terms. I just wish that Hollywood would give originality and creativity a stronger chance in the future.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tried to get on board with someone in the movie and I did, unfortunately it wasn't the male or female lead. The lead female wasn't at fault. Her material wasn't believable. Her fiancée is dead at the beginning of the movie and she is so heartbroken that she basically falls in love with a guy (his brother mind you) just about immediately. I'm a chick and I'm pretty hard core. When I've had break-ups, and most I've initiated (I know, I'm terrible), it takes me a little time to even want to be emotional towards another guy. Yes, there is the re-bound thing, but this is ridiculous, and what's so special about this guy at any point of the movie that makes her so in love with him. I felt the father, a cold-hearted ruthless man, was more appealing. This is supposed to take place over a hundred years ago. This made her seem so shallow. I couldn't get on board with her and being a female and not being able to get on board with any of the female characters is not a good thing. She could have been a whore and if that's what she was meant to be then I could have sympathized more with her but I didn't feel like she had much depth to her and not because of her acting, because she never had the chance with the situation and material she had in the movie. Someone loses a boyfriend or husband they love so much and are devastated by it you're meant to feel bad for, but not when she starts to fall in love with a guy almost immediately after she meets him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Special effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really impressed with the special effects in this movie. Benicio Del Toro was a great actor as always, but throughout most of the movie, his appearance was that of special effects. Just in a few parts of the film did he appear as his usual hairy fanged self. The special effects were good, but a bit odd. I guess that that I am not used to seeing Mr. Del Toro with a smooth face and normal looking teeth. Actually, with the special effects, he is quite handsome and rather dashing. Emily Blunt was quite good, but not allowed to really shine in the film. In her bigger roles, she shows what a great actor she is. Anthony Hopkins seemed rather tired, and not as engaged as he has been in previous films. Perhaps it is also having a smaller role. Overall the film seemed rather predictable, but it is a remake, so it shouldn't deviate too much from the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i thought this was a pretty good movie.it's bit predictable at times.but it's also fun.Benecio Del Toro really impressed with a flawless American accent.i could have done with someone else playing Hugo weaving's character.though.here,he just reminded me of his Agent Smith character in the Matrix series.by that i mean the same tone of voice,the same cadence and inflection,that sort of thing.maybe that's how Weaving always speaks,but it's just distracting for me.one thing about this movie:it's very graphically violent.the transformation scenes were well done,in my opinion as were the special makeup effects.it may be a remake of the 1941 original,but there some difference,if i recall correctly.anyway,i'm not gonna compare the two movies with each other,although i know i did also like the original.as for The Wolfman (2010),for me,it's an 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a modern Wolfman, but a Gothic tale set on the 19th Century amidst the moors and forests and old country homes in decay. While lights may have been available, the use of candles by the manor owner, Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins) set a great mood.Talbot was also the father of Lawrence (Benicio Del Toro), who, like a prodigal son, returns after his brother is reported missing by his fiancé Gwen (Emily Blunt).The first real action occurs in a gypsy camp, where Lawrence is bitten. You know what comes next.Of course, heads will roll, and arms will be pulled from their sockets as the beast goes on the prowl.The asylum provides both inhumane treatment and many laughs as the good doctors find that lycanthropy is very real.The streets of London are in a panic reminiscent of New York as Kong escapes. "God help us," exclaims the police inspector (Hugo Weaving).Lawrence knows what he must do once he learns the family secret...Everyone mentioned above gave very good performances. It was an enjoyable version of the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tries too much and does too little</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand this is to be a remake of a masterpiece of horror, so much that they had to stick to most of the same story and even use the same style of makeup and transformation effects. Why not use the same actors while you are at it, then? Sure they may be really old or dead, but we must stick to the template!I admit I started up with very high expectations; I wanted something like Gary Oldman's Dracula for the original Wolfman. Unfortunately, Benicio del Toro looked more like Stephen Rea than a werewolf and the whole acting experience felt completely off. There was no chemistry at all! I must say that what saved the movie and made it bearable was Hugo Weaving. As always, he did a performance that could convince anyone. I bet he would have made a great werewolf, if only given the chance. (Ahem!)Bottom line: tried too much to stick to the original and did too little to do justice to it. Poor imitation makes for poor flattery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wolfman ? "Teen Wolf 3 ? The howling"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found The Wolfman disappointing, it boasted a great story with plenty of twists &amp; turns, and an assortment of talented actors turning in great performances ? Del Toro plays his usual dark disturbed loner with chiseled features, Hopkins gives his "instant credibility just add water", and Hugo Weaving does his best 'Agent Smith goes back in time' impression which is excellent with some great comedy moments (unintentional perhaps??). The only thing that lets this movie down is the Wolfman itself - I guess the costume from Teen-Wolf just doesn't hold up anymore. This is a shame as the whole movie hinges on the Wolfman itself, and while there is some grissly violence and nice action set pieces, the lumpy, hobbling wolfdude is just hard to take seriously, especially his no-balls howling.On the Fruit-Meter Kick Ass gets the Rambutan- tastes good but looks ridiculous</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel this not a great movie, this is some what OK, in this movie some part of the movie is boring. All the actors are acted well, finally i can rate this movie as 5/10.While it lacks the pathos of the Chaney, Jr. version, this one boasts far more impressive sets (and settings), cinematography, and makeup fx. Lousy cgi have been shoe-horned in and actually manage to detract from all else. Del Toro does a commendable job in the title role, evincing some genuine depth of emotion early on (especially when haunted by echoes from his past), but the lack of a true romance hurts the film (the "budding relationship" gets nipped in said bud just when it should've blossomed); and when he professes his love, late in the going, it simply doesn't ring true. Anthony Hopkins comes close to stealing the show, but this is clearly Del Toro's time to shine- and shine he does. Whenever Del Toro is on screen, he commandeers center stage. Hugo Weaving is about as competent as one might expect an actor to be in a role essentially little more than an attitude, but that's about it. Paul Naschy made a career out of lycanthropy; I see no reason whatsoever why Del Toro couldn't do the same. He's certainly off to a good start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Special Effects Try-Out... That's All!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's about time to bring werewolf back to the screen again. With nowadays technologies, "The Wolfman" is a good vessel to explore how far Special Effects and makeup would go. The movie itself has appropriately taken care by former Special Effects expert, Joe Johnston. Johnston was involved in the first trilogy of "Star Wars" (1977-1983) as Special Effects Art Director. His previous famous movies as a Director are "Jumanji" (1995) and "Jurassic Park III" (2001). The movie is starred by Benicio Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt and Hugo Weaving. Although Del Toro acts well in thiz movie, I personally think it's very lamentable to use Del Toro for thiz kind of movie. As we knew before, Del Toro was a very good Actor in serious dramas. The most anticipated part in thiz movie is definitely "The Transformation Scene" when Del Toro becomes a werewolf. Rick Baker's makeup already supports the scene very well. The storyline is standard. The twist ending is not too surprising. Maybe we could blame Johnston for thiz, because he is too much focus on technical aspects and ignores the drama factors. If we see thoroughly there are a lot of nuances are similar to Tim Burton's "Sleepy Hollow" (1999). Despite of "Sleepy Hollow" happened to be more attractive in some ways. The werewolf's figure has already been a great horror icon since Michael Jackson's "Thriller" music video. So thiz is definitely the time for another moon to rise.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just keep in mind that it's a remake of the first real werewolf movie, it's gonna be cheesy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this movie was a bit of a disappointment, it was still really fun.First the good. The atmosphere is great, tons of fog with an amazing score by Danny Elfman. Del Toro does a good job as a tortured Lawrence Talbot and Hopkins is great as a tragedy-ridden, world-weary old man.The werewolf, while not exactly the most terrifying creature to grace a screen, does look pretty cool (better than the original anyway), and the action scenes give you that sense of spine-tingling, smile-inducing awesomeness. The transformation scenes are where the Wolfman really shines. They are by far the best parts of the movie.Now, the bad. While Del Toro is nice as Talbot, he isn't given much time to work with Talbot's emotions because very little screen time is spent on character development or backstory. This causes three things: 1)it a bit difficult to sympathize with Talbot 2)some plot turns can be hard to follow and 3)his and Gwen's relationship gets serious out of nowhere. While the werewolf does look cool, it's also pretty cheesy. His teeth in particular made me cringe. I think they should have gone the way the Nightmare on Elm Street remake is: 80-90% makeup, 10-20% CGI. Because the villain is insanely easy to guess, (just look at the cast list), the plot twist at the end is not that surprising. The fight scene at the end of the movie was a good idea, but poorly executed. And some parts of the movie felt rushed.Overall, not scary, but just fun. Let's call it a creepy action flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw The Wolfman on the first day it was realised in cinemas. I was very excited for this film, and i am happy to say it met most of my expectations. Most. The choice to use make-up over CGI gives off a beautiful effect. The use of make-up gives the film a real classic film, and is a great tribute to the original. All the cast are good, but hands down Hugo Weaving steals the show. Sarcastic, intimidating Hugo portrays all these perfectly. But,alas, this movie does have its flaws. After a incredible set piece in the streets of London, Director Joe Johnston and Writers Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self don't know where to take The Wolfman. Leading us back to the start of the story, a ridiculous and pointless back story is hurried into the last 15 minutes, leaving the audience with a stupid end "fight" sequence and disappointing ending.In conclusion, Wolfman is a fantastic tribute to the original and all other original horror/monster movies, but you can't help but feel the last 15 minutes where added purely for 10 year old boys.</fullReview>

Throughout the film several ideas were thrown which never got developed which made me wonder why they were put there in the first place.However, updated special effects make it worth watching! It is grim and gruesome and scary as hell, although I was able to time the scary moments to the second as they were telegraphed in advance by the music and camera-work.Still..... you know exactly what you are getting with this film, so there is no cause for complaint.

		<fullReview>I thought this was a pretty good tribute to the classic 1941 original. Some parts seemed kind of boring and you just wanted Lawrence to turn into the Wolfman. Benicio del Toro was a perfect choice for Lawrence Talbot because he reminds me a lot of Lon Chaney Jr. When his brother Ben, is missing, Lawrence returns to his home town to investigate what happened. While visiting some gypsies, a werewolf comes and wreaks havoc. Lawrence is bit and slowly becomes one also. He tries to hide from Inspector Francis Aberline and seeks help from Gwen, his brother's fiancée. I loved when Lawrence turned into the Wolfman, because that's what it's all about. I loved the gory death scenes. If you love the original classic, maybe you'll love THE WOLFMAN!!!</fullReview>

The special effects and the werewolf sequences were good. The transformation scenes were especially cool to watch.

The story is only tolerable for so long until finally you're dying for the next werewolf mash-up to happen. I imagine some people may enjoy the storyline, but it was just too slow paced for me. However, when the wolf scenes finally come along it makes it all worth it, so this movie is definitely worth seeing just for that. 6.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Classic Movie Monster is Revamped, But Not Improved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wolfman" follows in the tradition of classic studio monsters such as Frankenstein or Dracula, and it knows what its audience expects. The film is very bleak and shot with barely any light to fully see what we are being exposed to. The atmosphere works really well; it completely sweeps you into a classic monster movie, which tells a tale of the impossible and the horrific. With a film like this, atmosphere is tremendously important. The mood has to be set so you can fully grasp the terror in the images on the screen. Looking at pure visual style, the film accomplishes just that, it is like watching one of the Universal Studios classics revamped. But there were some qualities that removed me from the atmosphere, one of which is the violence. Body dismemberment may be grotesque, but the fact is, it is not scary. I found myself cringing at gore more than being truly scared. The original is frightening for the fact that you are witnessing a man turning into a monster, which, done well, can really inspire a great horror movie. But this film falls back into action, which is not in the tradition of the genre that this film is trying to be a part of. The film also has make-up wizard Rick Baker at its disposal, who has made countless jaw-dropping creatures and effects. However, he is not put to good use here as most of the scenes use CGI in place of make-up. It feels out of place seeing a smooth moving computer werewolf composite in 19th century England.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another embarrassingly overdone and ineffective butchering of a horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is one thing to be said about director Joe Johnston's remake (or 'reimagining', as is the usual bland justification) of The Wolf Man, it is that it ably reinforces the benefits of trusting first impressions. First word of the project had led to snarls of discontent from fans of the original (surely not another horror classic destroyed!) to general unease (do we really need another horror remake?), yet star Benicio Del Toro's insistence on lavish respect for the original to the point of utilizing practical effects (an actual man in fur rather than a cop-out CGI creation) sated many complaints and many began to cultivate genuine excitement for that rare horror film willing to stay faithful to its origins. And, of course, such expectations immediately crumbled upon the release of a work even worse than initial pangs of hesitation could have suggested. For Johnston's The Wolf Man, rather than a classier addition to the contemporary horror pantheon instead proves one of its most tasteless entries: a sensationalized, senseless, shambling mess.While the 1941 Lon Chaney Jr. original proved elegantly effective in its skeletal simplicity, its retread appears bewildered as to how to remain allegiant to the source text while still delivering on the demands of contemporary horror. Rather than choosing one or the other, or allowing one to skillfully bleed into the other, the film's screenplay, with all the tact and sophistication of a hyperactive three-year-old with a hammer, only succeeds in crafting a film which disgracefully fails at both objectives. While the obvious (and most successful) approach would have been to devote further focus on the titular character itself, allowing for further drama, pathos and poignant inclusion of thematic temporal concerns befitting the genre, the film instead opts for the banal inclusion of yet another wearisome 'doppleganger' antagonistic conflict, and is dementedly content to simply shove said plot strand into the narrative, derailing any flimsy sense of pacing or cohesion which may once have existed.Similarly, the film does not even prove self-aware enough to embrace its own 'so-bad-it's-good' campiness factor, instead vying for 'serious credibility' with gruesomely realistic violence and gore yet overusing them with the reckless abandon of a splatterhouse comedy, evoking a glaring contrast between the excesses of over-sensationalized carnage and the hilariously plodding dialogue, nonexistent characterisations and Danny Elfman's embarrassingly clichéd and downright useless musical score. To give Johnston his due, he does craft a fittingly grim and Gothic atmosphere of fog and shadows, even if his frequent high speed time lapse shots of the moon changing wrench any subtlety or effectiveness from sequences aspiring at building tension. Otherwise, only a single nightmare sequence and the initial transformation scene generate any fumblings of fear or quality to retain interest, the rest being swamped by an atrocious mass of contemptible shoddiness and complacency.Even the superb cast prove universally awful, their feeble attempts at performances only serving to sink the film further into its quagmire of wretchedness. The normally stellar Benicio Del Toro delivers his tormented Lawrence Talbot all the range and nuance of a brick wall, mumbling his lines as if asleep and substituting blank confusion for any foreseeable emotion. While he may perk up somewhat when clad in wolf fur, his beady-eyed snarlings alone are not enough to salvage anything foreseeable as a proper performance. As Talbot's reclusive father, Anthony Hopkins, rather than contributing dignity and class, is instead a shamefully uncomfortable watch, his leering and cackling like a deranged goblin (even parodying his own Hannibal Lector voice at one point) instantly destroying any hopes of keeping his 'surprise villainy' a secret, and the sight of him transforming into a pudgy werewolf proving the most unintentionally hilarious moment of the film. Emily Blunt is simply a nonentity of a presence as Talbot's haunted love interest, delivering a performance intangible enough to seemingly fade off the screen, and even Hugo Weaving, attempting to have some fun chewing the scenery as a caustic, suspicious police inspector feels only irritating and unnecessary.A suspense film foolish enough to bank its tension on twists revealed oddly early, a horror film with effects and delivery too overdone to be horrific, and a psychological drama which instead comes across as a boorish farce - seldom has a film let down even its initial scanty potential as much as Johnston's astoundingly poor The Wolf Man. Oh, and to add insult to injury: even the practical werewolf effects, the main selling point of the film, are still dwarfed by, you guessed it, unconvincing CGI. 'Cursed' could hardly be a more fitting description.-4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>amazingly enough, you want more of the human story and less of the monster in this surprisingly worthy remake of a classic horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a little apprehensive at first of going into "The Wolfman" for two reasons. Number one, it was a remake and most of the remakes I've seen in the past ten years have ranged from mediocre to awful. Number two, because it was clearly going to be a gory horror film, which it is. But surprisingly enough, I enjoyed and even got caught up in this most effective remake but it does sink my heart a little as the masterpiece quality that it shows at many points never fully pans out to the full potential. But don't get me wrong. This is a very entertaining movie. Scary? No. But enjoyable? Absolutely.The plot and most of the story is the same as the 1941 original, with some very nice twists thrown into it. Lawrence Talbert (Benicio Del Toro) receives word that his brother is dead and comes to his mourning father (Anthony Hopkins) and his dead brother's fiancée (Emily Blunt). Then, as you'd figure it, Lawrence is one day bitten by a savage wolf-like animal and begins to suffer from panic attacks and strange animal-like symptoms and before long...well, you know.In my opening paragraph, I described to you that I think this movie shows masterpiece quality but does not reach it. This is what I meant. What I meant by that was that the parts that do work in this movie are wonderful and absorbing and the parts that don't work are very clichéd and a little dull. What works? The important parts: the story and the characters. You want more of the human characters and less of the hairy flesh-eating beast in this creature feature. I found the characters very interesting and I was very intrigued by the relationships between them. Usually in movies of this grade, all the characters are for is to stand around and be eaten. Here, I got involved with the romance between Benicio Del Toro and Emily Blunt, two very underrated professionals in the acting business and I was also intrigued by the relationship between Del Toro and his father played by the great Anthony Hopkins. What was also very cool, for me anyway, was the casting choices, because the new cast mirrors that of the 1941 original. Director Joe Johnston cast actors who not only resemble those in the original, but who had similar acting styles. Benicio Del Toro reminds us both in appearance and performance of Lon Chaney, Jr and Anthony Hopkins has a similar screen-capturing presence like Claude Rains did. A new addition to the cast is a hunter/psychiatrist played by Hugo Weaving, who is also very good in the picture even though his character's personality is completely stereotypical and two-dimensional."The Wolfman" is also done well on a technical standpoint. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful and it captures the feeling of an alternative reality that a movie like this needs to embrace. The art direction is fabulous as well. I loved looking at the movie as well as experiencing the subliminal qualities it had to offer. The music score is also, I'm glad to say, most effective whereas most soundtracks in contemporary horror films fail to be memorable.Now what didn't ring my bell? Well, the creature. The wolf-man. And this is why: because when the humans were on screen, I felt a refreshing presence, a welcomed substance in a horror film. When the creature came on-screen and started tearing people limb from limb and spraying stage blood all over the walls, I felt a little letdown because I felt I'd seen this all before. Now if they just done two things: 1) tone down the violence in these scenes and 2) space them further apart and allow more screen time with the characters then I think this would have risen to the stellar status of being a modern masterpiece. And the other problem with the gory moments? Well, they are overdone and repeated too often to the point where they no longer become scary.In the end, although I had a few pre-viewing concerns, "The Wolfman" turned out to be a very enjoyable picture. I only wished that the director had chosen to limit the amount of gory attacks in the movie and focus more on the human characters, for they were a lot more interesting than seeing the familiar routine of people being attacked out of nowhere and torn to pieces, spraying blood all over the set. And for those who are concerned about the blood and guts, don't worry. It's not very scary, mostly because again the attack scenes are too repetitive and familiar, and therefore, I think anybody over the age of ten should be able to cope with this. I enjoyed this remake of a classic horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting a lot from this film. I wasn't disappointed at all. I really enjoyed it. I love how it had gore and violence that monster movies obviously have but it seemed more classic in a way because the whole movie was very dark and Gothic looking so the blood wasn't out there in your face like other movies. Which although I do not mind gore, I think it can be overdone and make a movie seem more gross than scary at times. This was a good medium. It wasn't scary in a sense. I don't really get scared by monster movies though so I might not be a good judge at that. I think they are awesome more than anything. Thumbs up on this remake Universal!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not awful, just disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I spent this Valentine's Day with my significant other, treating her to a costly Indian dinner under one condition: we would see The Wolfman. It feels like years ago I first saw the trailer for this remake of the classic 1941 horror film. Indeed, the movie's production has been quite a horror story itself, and was plagued with reshoots and re-edits. I waited patiently through the delays and release date changes, so when it finally hit theaters, I knew I couldn't miss it.The story is simple, and closely follows the original and its late 19th century setting. Lawrence Talbot (Benicio del Toro), an actor living in America, returns home to England when he learns of his brother's mysterious death. He stays with his father, Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins), who lives alone in a creepy old mansion that is in desperate need of a good dusting. There's also Gwen (Emily Blunt), the young widow grieving over the death of her husband, Lawrence's brother. Hmm, I wonder what will happen there? Anyway, Lawrence finds himself at a gypsy camp one night while the mysterious beast is about, and makes the mistake of venturing alone into a fog (a big no-no). He is bitten by the beast, and you can probably guess what happens next.Sadly, the story is never gripping; in fact, nothing about The Wolfman is. The first half of the film takes itself too seriously, and is nearly void of any action whatsoever. The second half ends up somewhere between Tim Burton and Sam Raimi. There are some good silly moments, but they are too inconsistent to be labeled "silly fun".I try not to let a film's production history shape my opinions, but I could not help but notice a serious case of overproduction here. The editing seems too choppy and there's too much of Danny Elfman's score. And why must filmmakers throw in a CGI bear when they've managed to create a werewolf nearly free of any computer effects? The Wolfman was directed by Joe Johnson, the man behind Jumanji and Jurassic Park 3. After watching this film, I admit I'm nervous about what he might do with the upcoming Captain America movie.The Wolfman is not an awful film, just disappointing. Considering the acting talent featured here, a much better movie was definitely possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Familiar old school monster thriller with some modern movie trappings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The goals of today's reboots have been to update the originals with the special effects of the modern era and add complexity and depth to cinema's most memorable characters. This is only half true for Universal's long-delayed "The Wolfman" remake. The full-moon transformations of man to werewolf are enhanced with top-notch gruesome CGI, but the man behind the beast remains uncomplicated. This "Wolfman" is a classic monster horror film with a modern pulse. Clichéd suspense and generic storytelling are king, only they're accompanied by extreme gore and curdling special effect for a more 21st Century thrill.It takes a bit for "The Wolfman" to clearly establish itself as a typical monster movie. The story jumps right in with actor Lawrence Talbot (Del Toro) being summoned back home to Blackmoor, England by his brother's fiancée (Blunt) because his brother has mysteriously disappeared. It's quickly after that we learn he's dead and suddenly Lawrence and Gwen have an affinity for one another. Then there's a quick side note assuring us Anthony Hopkins will indeed be creepy as the family patriarch, Sir John Talbot.After the initial werewolf shreds some guts and swipes off a few heads, it finally bites Lawrence the story really begins. Minus the trite dialogue using monster-related similes about how dangerous he is and how he doesn't know it and that Gwen should go before she gets hurt all while constant shots of the moon remind us of what will inevitably happen next, it's entertaining. The two very good scenes in the film happen toward the middle when Lawrence is captured and taken to an asylum in London. First he has a series of nightmarish flashbacks to childhood trauma as the staff tries those reputable ice bath and shock treatments. The best, however, is when the head doctor who believes him crazy wants to make an example of him before a lecture hall of colleagues and straps him to a chair while the full moon is set to show he's been cured. Of course that's not what happens at all. Comical gore ensues.Amid the typical monster shenanigans that result somehow in a wolf-on-wolf showdown, there are a few wasted talents. Emily Blunt is too good for this film and Hugo Weaving (Mr. Smith of "The Matrix" and V in "V for Vendetta") provides the film's only example of acting with subtext. Del Toro and Hopkins are more or less wasted although odd characters of questionable morals always come better from Hopkins than from just anybody."The Wolfman" is a big-budget monster horror movie and it deserves to be viewed with those kinds of expectations despite the reputation of its stars and the inherent trend of most films trying to reboot a classic going for the more serious, theme-driven stories. "Wolfman" just picks a couple interesting thematic lines and delivers them one more time just to sound legitimate. The film is entertaining despite the basic and surprise-less script. In a sense its shallow delivery is an homage to old-school horror films. It would have been nice to have gotten a more complicated retelling of the tragic tale of Lawrence Talbot, but it works just fine as a genre film.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, but not brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wolfman is an adequate updating of the Universal franchise, with good and bad aspects.On the good side, it looks great. Production design is excellent, and physical and CG effects are very good. It homages the original nicely - this is very much a Wolfman, not a man who turns into a wolf. And Anthony Hopkins has a ball - he clearly relishes every second he is on screen.Now to the not such good bits. For a lot of its running time, I felt it had no sense of urgency. Danny Elfman's music was constant, undistinguished, and deafening. Neither Emily Blunt nor Benicio del Toro engaged me - I never cared in the slightest what happened to either of them, and the tragedy of Larry Talbot's situation was never an issue. And, worst of all, it never quite made up its mind whether it was a serious horror film or a romp and, accordingly, it fell between two stools.So, decent enough but no classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best things about this movie: Hugo Weaving, the costumes, and the cinematography.I'm not a big fan of loud boo scares, they're the cheap way out. I was expecting real horror, the kind that makes you fear the unknown. This was pretty straightforward; some quiet music at the appropriate moment and you knew something hairy was about to pop out. Instead of fearing whatever goes bump in the night one ends up fearing the damage to one's ear drums. Elfman's score didn't quite fit the movie, either. Too flamboyant and too distracting from the actual movie.All and all, I got the feeling of sitting down in a 5-star restaurant, being offered every dessert on the menu, and have your plate taken away before you've taken a bite. The scenes were over before you really got into it, but (un)fortunately the plot was so simple and spelled out early that the viewer didn't have to do much thinking to figure out what was going on. I would've wished there was something more in the plot to get a chance to get interested in the story.Best parts were Hugo Weaving and Emily Blunt, and I loved the costumes and locations, and I liked the woman at the tavern, for some reason. I couldn't figure out if Del Toro was an awful actor or a good actor with a bad script. Liked Anthony Hopkins's character, save for the ending. Some scenes in this movie were just pretty to look at.I came out of the theater thinking I've just seen a good commercial for a pint of bitter, and I did not get the pet bear.This would've been a 4/10, but Hugo Weaving and the well designed Victorian-era costumes and locations bump it up to a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointing and uninspired updating of the werewolf myth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie was going into production, it made the news for all the wrong reasons with its change of directors, re-shoots, unhappy star, etc. While hints of this can be seen in the somewhat disjointed nature of its plot, it still does not make excuses for its evident shortcomings. A remake of a much older film, it tells the story of an American man called Laurence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro - looking like a rather aged Leonardo Dicaprio) who journeys to England after his brother is brutally savaged to death by a strange creature while out on the moors. It transpires that this animal was a werewolf. In the course of his investigations into his brother's death, Del Toro gets attacked by the same creature, but somehow survives, almost certainly guaranteeing that come the next full moon, he too will turn into a similar monster?The film has all the gloss you would expect from a movie of its caliber and budget. It looks lovely with moody photography, Hammer-esquire style set dressing, foreboding locations and an effective, ever-present swirling cloud of Gothic mist during a lot of the night time sequences. There are also some neat time-lapse visual touches, which add to a very polished looking production. A pleasing amount of gore is on display and we're treated to decapitations, dismemberments and eviscerations galore. While there's absolutely no doubt to the workmanship, the problem here lies in the script. The movie starts off good, but somehow loses its way, never quite living up to the initial promise. Benito Del Toro is charismatic in his role and seems to have been born to play it, but the entire production just has a pointless, 'so what?' feel to it. The movie falls flat on its face maybe a third of the way in. It just seems to just run out of juice (a legacy of re-shoots, perhaps?), which is a shame due to the evident talent on board. For example, the romance between Del Toro and Emily Blunt is completely unconvincing: at the beginning of the movie she was in love with Del Toro's brother, but later on she's in love with Del Toro? And willing to risk her life for him even though she barely knows him and he's running around killing people? It's plot holes like these that can't stand up to scrutiny and give credence to the troubled creative process this no doubt had. Still it's a good thing Hugo Weaving is on hand as a detective from Scotland Yard to keep us all interested. He invests his role with the appropriate amount of grit. So much so in fact that without him, your interest in this movie would have seriously waned. On top of all this, there's also the fact that the filmmakers have opted for a rather ill advised decision, which becomes the movie's fatal flaw?If you're going to remake an old movie, you need to update it accordingly and therein resides the problem here: The Wolfman is too faithful to the original. Rather than giving us a werewolf design to knock our socks off, we instead get the same style as the original. He's still essentially a bipedal creature, albeit one with hugely superior make-up. While it is rather admirable that the filmmakers chose to go practical rather than CGI, we still just end up with a guy wearing clothes while covered in hair. Where's the point in that? Where is all the updating and the re-visioning? The sad fact is the werewolf is painfully retro in style. Why couldn't they have just let their imaginations go and given us something frightening? Why didn't they give us a slavering unholy monstrosity? As director if you're not going to change anything about The Wolfman and bring something unique to it, then why even bother? It is also rather telling that even though it was released in 1981, An American Werewolf in London still contains the best werewolf transformation scene ever done. Even with its in-camera animatronic effects, it still beats the transformation scene in this movie hands down. Granted, whatever CGI that is used here to bridge the metamorphosis from human to monster is done quite effectively, the resulting snarling hairy man still lets it down. To add further credence to the American Werewolf's superiority, the new movie even seems to contain a kind of homage to it in the scene where the creature runs amok and we see a tram/carriage keeling over much in the same way a Double Decker bus does in a similar scene from Piccadilly Circus in the 1981 movie. Worse of all, as this is a movie made to satisfy the comic book movie generation, it even has the obligatory one-on-one fight sequence between two superhuman creatures at the end. Except rather than a superhero and his nemesis, here we get two hairy supernatural beasts slugging it out. We've seen this type of scenario time and time again and frankly it's getting boring. Can a movie end with something other than a bout of 'fisty-cuffs' for a change? It's already been done to death in movies like Spiderman, Ironman and Wolverine et al.The movie hints at a (surprise, surprise) sequel. While this might be an unwelcome prospect for most, let's hope they at least have a better script than the one they went ahead with here. Oh yeah, and a complete overhaul of the werewolf design wouldn't go astray either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The wolf within man..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took a long time for the dynamics of the story to unfold, and once they did unfold, they were revealed to be nothing but a formulaic take on the old werewolf tale. The Gothic visuals are formulaic too. So what's left? Only the vague metaphor of the protagonist being unable to escape destiny. It works like this: the story of the father passing the werewolf curse to the son corresponds with the revelation that the son had been abused as a child by the father. The difference is: the father chooses to let the beast take over and murders his wife (the mother), while the son reigns over the beast but is being murdered by his sweetheart (a replica of the mother). Intriguing but nothing more than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give it a 5 for it's beautiful camera direction. As for the costume design -- Totally cheesy! Looks like a mascot for a high school basketball team. There are a couple of twists in the plot, but nothing too shocking... A little bit confusing towards the end about the father's emotions -- I wasn't exactly sure what the deal with his character was. Overall the werewolf was unveiled within the first 5 minutes of the movie, leaving nothing sinister or mysterious to the imagination... It wasn't totally scary, but there were moments of surprise ambushes coupled with loud noises... if that's all it takes to get you going, you might just enjoy this movie. Otherwise, I thought it's terribly cliché and overdone. The werewolf should have been more mysterious, revealing itself to the audience somewhere halfway along the movie where the viewer is waiting on the edge of their seat to finally catch a glimpse of this Jekyll/Hyde-like rampaging protagonist.WEAK! I'd wait to see it on DVD if you haven't bought tickets for this movie in theaters already. I have a feeling the grittiness of the small screen would do it a little more justice as it could have easily been a made-for-TV movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The costumes and look of the film are good, but the overall result is somewhat lacking in all departments aside from gore. Considering the well documented troubled production issues, its a wonder anything watchable remains. These troubles include: The original director leaving for "creative issues"; Joe Johnston rushed in to fill the directorial chair with expectations to stick to the original production deadline (with a reduced budget); discounting Elfman's original Gothic soundtrack and re-scoring with a synthesized modern score-then reverting back to Elfman! Studio "suit" interference resulted in this nearly being put down with silver bullet prior to its completion! The funny thing is, the studio then decided to have re-shoots which extended the productions deadline and increased the budget. Why didn't they stick with the original director and let him have his way in the first place? The film is a watchable diversion, but as you exit the cinema-there is no lasting impression. The characters relationships seem to have been left on the cutting room floor, there is substance to the love that Del Toro and Blunt are supposed to have developed for one another. The "twist" ending-if it can be called that as its so obvious and silly also grates. One big issue for me were the werewolf transformations. When you consider a master FX craftsman, Rick Baker, was brought on board (with his Oscar-winning knowledge &amp; experience "American Werewolf In London" practical and mechanical effects), how can the results here be so average? "AWIL" was made in 1981 and nearly 30 years later this movies transformations are very "yeah, whatever." I have read Baker's barely concealed comments on the powers that be influence-not sure if he means it was the studio, the director, or both-but he should have been given total control over these areas. Why bring a top notch make-up and practical FX guy to oversea average CGI tosh?! Someone owes Mr Baker another shot at his own title......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mess of editing, but still campy fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its rare these days for a monster movie to go for scares. Most either take the route of becoming action movies, or descend into campiness. The reason for this is simple: old school monster movies have lost their effect due to a desensitized audience. Todays viewers are well aware of the stuff movies can do, so effects alone can't convince. The wolfman, a semi-remake of one of the original classic monster movies, certainly doesn't bring the scares, but it has enough campy fun to be worth watching.The Wolfman certainly seems to be taking itself seriously at first. After his brother is found mutilated, estranged son Lawrence Talbot returns home to find the best that did it. Of course he finds the beast, and it bit by it, and inherits the curse. The scenes leading up to this are treated relatively seriously, with Lawrence's father waxing sentimental and his brother's fiancée being appreciative enough that we know the two will engage in some kinky inter-species nasty later on (spoilers: doesn't happen, though I'm sure it would have been a great moment for film).Then it all gets gleefully tossed aside when the werewolf attacks a gypsy camp, full earning its 18A rating in the most ludicrous showering of gibs since, well, Daybreakers. Backs are ripped off, heads are swiped clean, and organs are strewn about in all sorts of pretty ways. Its all well in fun, but its never scary. Indeed, camp is the natural replacement of scares in horror movies. In general, if one cannot frighten, throw in as much gore as humanly possible to get laughter and maybe the odd squick. The Wolfman does this in spades, but if thats the mood you're in it works splendidly.The editing nearly kills it though. While the camera is always steady and clear, its still difficult to comprehend what is going on because things just seem to happen. Its like the scenes were longer, and then essential bits just got thrown out to make the film shorter. The climactic wolf battle is a particularly egregious example, which resulted in plenty of "wtf's" from me.The plot is somewhat serviceable, though the lack of a strong villain is glaring. Not that Man VS Himself wouldn't work in this situation, just that they attempt to include a weak villain that never really grabs attention. A lot of the fault is on the characters. Del Toro plays it straight, which may have been the wrong choice for this film. Blunt is plenty ladylike, but forgettable. Hopkins is horribly disappointing as Lawrence's father, spouting off wannabe-epic dialogue that mostly falls flat or seems random. The bad guy (I'll keep it a secret) has one scene where he ineffectly lists off his bad deeds with the calm of someone reading groceries, seeming more lazy than evil. If he had said he kicked puppies and spat on the Pope I wouldn't be surprised. The only good performance comes from Hugo Weaving as Detective Freddy Aberline, inexplicably based on the real-life investigator of the Ripper murders. He has one particular crowning moment of awesome in a bar, but otherwise is underutilized.The Wolfman is no classic, but there's worse matinees to see. Its a complete and utter mess by some standards, but has enough campy charm to be more than enjoyable to laugh along with. Werewolves may be down and out for scares, but at least they can be relied on to maul things in brutally hilarious ways.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, the good...Special Effects: Any time you have Rick Baker leading the special effects crew you are gonna have top-notch stuff! Emily Blunt and Hugo Weaving really shined in their performances. I highly enjoyed their scenes and in my opinion they made the movie.There was an ominous tone throughout the entire movie, which added a creepiness to it. The not so good...Acting by Del Toro and Hopkins seemed forced and cheesy at times. They didn't have me convinced that they fully understood their characters. Anthony Hopkins seemed rushed during his lines and Del Toro's acting seemed over the top.The fight scene between father and son at the end was cheesy...that's all I can pretty much say about it.The scenes moved TOO fast through the entire film. I counted at least 5-8 times where one scene would last 30 seconds, then the next scene was 30 seconds, followed by another scene that was 30 seconds, etc.Movie was a decent remake for the most part. I give it a 6 out of 10 due to the special effects, and because of the acting by Blunt and Weaving. Is it worth wasting 12 at the movies? Probably not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Dullest Werewolf-Movies, Buddy-Comedies, Kids-Adventures Ever !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Anthony Hopkins) is one of the best actors and comedians in the last 20 years. So why to make a lame movie with an wolfman? The answer : to be in business, to not be forgotten as a name in unstoppable ruthless industry, and to have a wonderful experience with an wolf BUT did we get any wonderful experience out of watching this ? I feel pity because of an easy script like this. So what was the meaning that the lead is a motivational speaker ?! and what exactly had changed in him after this head trip ? and is there any intended similarity between him as a speaker and his father as a clown ? Then what was the running theme in this whole movie anyway ?!! I'm sorry, but the ultimate answer for all would be : NOTHING! OK, Nicholas Dayy plays cleverly a crazy Colonel (in the same year of his breakthrough A Time to Kill) although that was humorous lateral duel, but the script made him take part after the end of its first half !?? And event like the lead's fiancée leaving him to marry his publisher (as the finale's board shows) pushes you to ask: Why she left him??! I think the "Trip" just affected the lead in a way to learn more lessons about life or to know what he really wants, and to discover more credibility around him. But all of that just in damned theoretical invisible way ! Even the end's sentimental situation looked fake with some line that hadn't much persuasion behind it so I can buy it anyway ! The major irony is super though it would've been better if the lead's character was animal hater, too pompous arrogant, selfish villainous who'll going to be redeemed by the events! So speaking of ironies I think the biggest of them all is that you have (Del Toro) with some trained lovely (Emily Blunt) through return to his ancestral homeland, an American man is bitten, and subsequently cursed by, a werewolf and there isn't more than one laugh along the way !??? What a failure ! This movie got the very little, very cursory to present : touching moments (the wolf picks up tenderly the funny nose of her dead friend), comic time (Hopkins trying to choke Del Toro out of tedium), thrilling situations (the climax) and, sadly more than surprisingly, that was it ! As my review's title says, it didn't want to be a movie about characters, or character ! It didn't make much in area comic movies like (Any Which Way You Can - 1980) made a lot in it, and it's nothing like the polished peaceful family adventures that Disney produces yearly (at least they're meaningful !). So it was poor, tasteless, BLA BLA BLA, or wait a minute.. It really worked on that level, the level of making a good BLA BLA BLA !</fullReview>

Why the werewolves in this movie look so bad. If I want to see Chubakka, then I stick to StarWars, where it belongs. I understand that it is an oldschool thing, an homage to the original movie, but hey, what's the point of the remake, if it isn't better than the original?Everything else was just right, but when I was seeing the werewolves on-screen, I smiled, and tried to hold back a loud laugh. It was the hardest, when Sir Anthony Hopkins teared off his shirt. I just missed Yoda.There must be a conspiracy somewhere. Because if there is a somewhat decent werewolf in a movie, then it is bad in other ways. And here, everything was right (the mood, the legend, the location, the cast - even if Benicio was better in a role of a drug junkie) but the "monsters" ruined it all for me)Underworld had werewolves like big rats... Wolfman had werewolves from Endor... New Moon's wolves are just wolves... Van Helsing was lame, but it had a good wolf... If CGI is out of question, then Dog Soldiers was good enough...Please, make a good !horror! movie with a decent werewolf already!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware The Wolfman!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be frank, I had had not much expectations of The Wolfman and I have only gain a bit of interest about it this year when it was nearing the release date. I am not much of a werewolf fan. I walked into the movie without any high expectations, I just knew it was going to entertain me no matter what. I was right...but it exceeded my low expectations. There is a balance of action, drama and thrills. It is good fun.The story: It is quite simple actually. The first scene has a man running away from the wolfman. Cue to the title. And then we soon find out that the man killed is Lawrence Talbot's brother. Obviously, Talbot will be bitten by the wolfman and becomes one himself. There is some action here and there, it is not action-packed though. Surely there is carnage. There is blood when the wolfman appears. There is a little twist which will lead to the final showdown. One thing that is not good is the over-use of shock scenes. I feel that the director kept adding shock scenes non-stop until when he thought that shock scene was effective, he slowed down the adding. The shock scenes did not really shock or scare me but somehow when one hour passed of the one hour and forty minutes movie, the shock scenes suddenly got slightly effective which had shook me out from the seat a little. Still, the shock scenes are over-used and the movie does not really depend on the intensity to keep us on the edge of the seats. One thing that is bravo is the music by Danny Elfman. He manages to compose thrilling and melodrama music. It matches the movie well.Overall: It may not be considered an Oscar-winning movie but it does its best to engage you in what is happening. This is the best movie of director Joe Johnston as his Jurassic Park 3 is just okay. I can't wait to see what Joe will do with Captain America.</fullReview>

The movie is straight forward and direct with no boring scenes, the visual effects were very good and the action scenes were frequent. If you want to watch an entertaining movie I would recommend this, the story line was not amazing it could have been better, that is why I believe it has been given a low rating.

		<fullReview>I went into this movie with low expectations after seeing it's reviews on Rottentomatoes. And I'm also such a big fan of the original that it was up against a lot for me. But luckily it turned out better than i thought.I was pretty impressed with the makeup. I was worried that this movie would consist of mostly cgi effects which I am not a fan of at all. But luckily a lot of the gore was done well, that and the way they made Benicio look as the Wolfman was pretty true to the original, which I was very happy about. You could tell at some parts that it was him under there, and not just a computer animated image, which was refreshing.The story was pretty decent as well, though i could've done without the family tie in. I also think they should've expanded more on the relationship between Lawrence and Gwen. It was well acted but it just didn't have the romantic charm that the original had. I would've enjoyed a reboot of the date scene among the gypsies that was done in the original. But that wouldn't have worked unless they changed the story back to the original. The music was top notch, and I'd expect nothing less. And best of all the film did have a bit of depth to it. Which is more than I can say for most horror movies of recent years.The only part that I genuinely didn't like was the ending. If there is a sequel I hope they aren't going the way I think they're going. There are some people I'd like to see return and some people I wouldn't.Overall the movie was better than how it is perceived on Rottentomatoes if nothing else. And it's worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are so many things right with this film that it's amazing that the whole doesn't work better.The special effects are excellent, particularly the werewolf transformations. Meanwhile, the atmosphere is great, with suspicious characters lurking in mist-shrouded woods and houses while the moon, passing through its phases, constantly threatens to unleash mayhem when it reaches full. And, on paper at least, the cast is superb.But it is with that cast that the problems begin. The leads all seem to be approaching their roles as if they'd rather not be there. Anthony Hopkins, in particular, is almost insultingly uninterested. Hugo Weaving is not much better and I wanted to scream "Wake up" at Emily Blunt before the picture was half done.Some of the secondary characters mitigate this somewhat, particularly Roger Frost as the ludicrous Reverend Fisk and Shaun Smith's turn as a pleasingly dour policeman.The story is pretty routine, but the conclusion is plausible in context, if easily guessable. Progress towards the latter is, however, interrupted by a gratuitous and overdone torture - sorry, therapy - scene, presided over by Antony Sher as a ridiculous German doctor with an outrageously bogus accent.Music is negligible and nondescript.I sort of enjoyed the film though. It certainly was not awful, but it should have been a whole lot better.Rating: 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Del Toro is a man who is pure at heart and says his prayers by night . . . . . . . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the signs were there. No director being found in time, reshoots, a release date pushed further and further back. Everyone had almost made up their mind before this movie was released that it was cloaked in the scent of failure. Well, I hope those people fight through their prejudgment and give this movie a try because it is actually a highly laudable remake and a bloody good film.Joe Johnston directs from a screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self (based on the 1941 screenplay by Curt Siodmak) and werewolf fans will be pleased to hear that Rick Baker (THE werewolf guy thanks to his amazing work in An American Werewolf In London) is also involved.Benicio Del Toro plays Lawrence Talbot, a travelling stage actor who returns home after he is informed of his brother's disappearance. Once there, he resumes the difficult relationship he has with his father (Anthony Hopkins) and gets to know his brother's fiancé (Emily Blunt) while also trying to unravel the mystery surrounding the event that brought him back to the family home. When the full moon rises, things get hairy and bloody once more and the locals are up in arms, full of nothing but suspicion for the nearby visiting gypsy folk and ready to blame the most convenient scapegoat for the horrors they cannot comprehend. Inspector Abberline (Hugo Weaving) seems to be the only figure of calm in an increasingly turbulent situation but will he remain so unflappable as the evidence piles up before his eyes? It's really hard to say whether or not this movie will appeal to those who have already grown up with such love for the original movie that it's based on (The Wolf Man, one of the Universal classic horrors) but I'd like to think that it will. Yes, it falls between two stools in many ways with it's blend of CGI and practical effects, it's pacing issues and it's focus on character more than the actual monster madness but that's what fans of classic horror movies have been used to in the past. And for those worried about the use of the computer effects, let me just say that while it IS noticeable in many places I have to say that this movie finally provides the blending of the new technology with the old in a way I have been hoping for ever since CGI started to cast it's large, large shadow.In the acting department, Del Toro gives what may well be his very best performance. Of course, that will be neglected and overlooked by most people as this is "simply" a horror movie but his portrayal of Talbot sums up the pain and tragedy of the character while also echoing the mighty Chaney Jr's performance from the original movie. It's simply superb. Anthony Hopkins is a lot of fun and livens up every scene he's in, Emily Blunt does very well and Hugo Weaving is a lot of fun in every scene he gets. In fact, everyone does very well . . . . be they travelling gypsies, arrogant psychiatrists or nervous locals.As for the rest of the movie, it seems to throw in many different flavours that somehow blend to create something wonderful. My rating may seem comparatively low compared to the praise here but that's subject to change upon future viewings. We get some lush sets and design work, some fantastic FX sequences, a wealth of sly little winks to fans of the lycanthrope subgenre and so much more than all of those bad omens mentioned in my opening paragraph would suggest. It may be far from perfect in many ways but, thank goodness, it certainly gets an awful lot right in a package that almost provides something for everyone. A new pup has nuzzled it's way into the pack.See this if you like: The Wolf Man, An American Werewolf In London, Werewolf Of London.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad if you don't expect much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this without any expectations as reviews were mostly negative. The film is bit dated since the concept is not new. What I liked most was technical side of the effort. The cinematography and art were something were clear cut reflection of that era. The land of Black Moor where wolfman was on rampage looks so haunting even without knowing that a creepy werewolf looms there. The costumes of Gypsy tribes were great. But the stand-out mention is transformation scene of man to werewolf.On acting side Benicio Del Toro and Anthony Hopkins did decent jobs but Emily Blunt was wasted as she is a good actress. Hugo weaving was just okay.All in all a time-pass flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Wolfman" (2010) or "Daddy Dearest!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, when Curt Siodmak wrote the original screenplay , way back in the early 1940's, he had a finite amount of material to work with, and MADE it work. Universal, now governed by MANY suits, has UNLIMITED resources, and cannot remake a simple story without dumbing down the storyline. Speaks volumes about the need for poverty.With a troubled film in production since 2006, "The Wolfman", Universal's latest incarnation of monster films in many years, attempts to reintroduce the new millennium into its vaults of classic monsters.The story is of a man bitten by a werewolf, and is as much of a victim, as the people he slays. They only partially succeed. The Wolfman makeup is top-notch, Rick Baker strikes into the darkness of the soul, and comes up with a terrific balance of Lycanthropy and terror. Danny Elfmans on , off again, and back on music score is a Classic ! Both Great Talents !Now for the negative points of the film. Poor editing, out of sequence time lines, inappropriate or goofy dialog, and just not a very smart script. I guess the screenwriters left their talent in the computer, it certainly wasn't in the script. Maybe they should go back to the old days, and pretend there are no more computers, and try to tell a story using the basic components of life. John Talbot(Anthony Hopkins) is miscast or misused as the distant Master of Talbot Manor in Blackmoor, England. The only thing spooky about it was that it needed a good cleaning. There is one thing, I wish I had the candle concession for the manor, you could make a fortune. Lawrence Talbot(Benecio Del Toro) head slightly cocked downward with up-looking eyes, is the tortured soul. Lawrence, a stage actor turned amateur detective, tries , sort of, to solve the murder of his emaciated murdered brother. Gwen Conliffe(Emily Blunt) is lovely ,and has great screen presence as the wife of the late brother.There is some chemistry between the two leading characters,but not much more than to light some of the candles in the Talbot manor. Abberline(Hugo Weaving) is interesting as the Inspector from Scotland Yard, and is an intriguing foil to play against Del Toro, even if his ludicrous assumptions are highly laughable, I think you will find them amusing, at the very least. It becomes clear quite early , that Anthony Hopkins is not the model for fatherhood, and that there is no cure for Lycanthropy. That being said, there is enough action to keep the viewer interested, as long as you overlook numerous plot holes, and glaring omissions of logic. I'm glad my name is not under "Directed by." More like wrecked by the suits at Universal. One thing is for sure, there will be a sequel, and maybe Universal will uncover more of their "monsters", hopefully with better results. I gave this film a 7, despite its' goofiness, and not having the ability to stay out of its' own way. See it with a GREAT AMOUNT of Suspension of Disbelief !or wait for the DVD/Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>let me start off by saying for a film thats both a remake and had a troubled production including studio interference and the lack of a inspired director...the film wasn't bad it just wasn't more then just OK either which is ashame since this film had a lot of potential..i will start by saying some good things i did find about this movie...one being the Cinematography was very well done...also it had some very nice setpieces and at times very creepy atmosphere...i did enjoy the music a lot as well...on the downside i felt that the acting while not bad was not up to the level i think it should have been for a movie like this...the plot was very disjointed and without trying to give away anything lets just say a lot of the plot and twists were so obvious from the beginning that one knew what was gonna happen next....another thing was the half ass way they explained the curse which was really quite dumb..But i think the god awful Cgi transformation sequences were the biggest let down for the film... you would think with all the technology they have today they could make more convincing Cgis personally i wish they would go back to the old school of hands on make up and special fx....its Sad to Say but American Werewolf in Londons transformation Scene was and still is The best transformation scene to ever be put on screen...and that was 28 years ago...the only movie i think i have ever seen that used Cgi in a very convincing way was Jurassic park. Another let down even though i hope that it will be restored to the film for the DVD release was the lack of on screen Carnage, i know a lot of people say this film is gory but its not and for those that think it is probably haven't seen many horror films or films with loads of gore..While i agree that a film can be good without gore....the fact that the director and crew on numerous occasions in different magazines and Articles stated this movie was given a Hard R rating for the Werewolf Carnage what else could it have been for since the film doesn't have any harsh language really and no nudity at all...however i think those in power at the studios chose to Tone the film down because all the Carnage happens so quickly you don't really get to see much of anything at all...Even the one death Scene they do show fully isn't much i mean for a Decapitation it was pretty damn bloodless...Overall the movie is just OK was it the worst film I've seen no far from it but it was a huge letdown and could have been so much better</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You would figure after almost 50 years, Hollywood would have chosen a better script for a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the god awful wake that is "The Twilight Series". i will give it some credit to opening peoples eyes to the vampire/werewolf rhealm. Even though their view of the subject is that of a retarded goat......non the less, the idea is grabbing peoples attention. Especially with vampires. Since its creation, it has spawned countless movies and even a fantastic TV show. But do people even know what a good vampire movie is? I mean, when i think of a vampire, my first reference is to either Bram Stoker's "Dracula" or "La Stat in "Interview with a Vampire". Not some hormonal tween who glows in sunlight and chases around a talentless actress. I know im getting ahead of myself here.......but the point is, what about the werewolf? Why doesn't this creature have its own definitive movie that everyone refers to? Well, given what i just said about werewolves not having their own movie, im pretty sure Hollywood was thinking the same thing. They put together this incredible cast, in hopes that its acting would match the ranks of the classic monster movie genre......but there was one little problem. Its story was so damn boring. This movie was missing one major key ingredient, which is crucial for all monster movies, and that is 'Depth'. You need to explain everything in not only great detail, but in an entertaining fashion as well. And this film did neither. It went into this movie assuming that you already knew all the rules, so it never even bothered explaining them. But that is half the fun of seeing a movie like this. Discovering deep dark secrets of a horrible beast. I just don't understand it. Even kid monster movies get that right. However, explaining the orgins of a werewolf is just one side of this horrible tale. The other main aspect that they were missing was the amount of character depth. Normally our main character is either someone you can connect with, or feel sorry for.....or on rare occasions, you just plain love watching them on screen. Our main character in this one"Benicio Del Toro", i think, was the wrong choice for this part. No no no, do not get my words mixed up......i love Benicio, i think he is a phenomenal actor.......but i don't think he provided the amount of emotion that this character needed. He was kind of this statue that just wondered around. In fact......almost every character was like that. Now im not going to blame everything on the cast, i really think they tried their best to brighten this turd........i mostly blame it on the script. It had no originality, no depth, and hardly any entertainment. Bottom Line......what a horrible remake. You would figure after almost 50 years, Hollywood would at least choose a decent enough script to make headway for the Werewolf world. Instead they give us this boring remake. But i will say this though........the only thing about the movie that i did like, was how they kept the same features of the original wolfman, and not going all CGI with it. Now to most, that may be a bit cheesy. But to me, it was nice to see.......however, it still does not change the fact that this movie is boring as all hell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looks like this werewolf fell into the GAP...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never understood what the term pedestrian meant when applied to film. Did it mean a movie would, on occasion, cross a street? If so, did it have the right of way? Well now that I've seen "The Wolfman", I've finally got a firm grasp of what this means.There was nothing really lacking in the performances. Benicio Del Toro did a good job as the cursed Lawrence Talbot?it didn't hurt that he just happens to look like Lon Chaney. Anthony Hopkins ran the razor's edge between paternal concern and menace as John Talbot. Rounding out the rest of the cast, Emily Blunt, Hugo Weaving, Art Malik, and Geraldine Chaplin all did their part in attempting to suspend my disbelief.The script was noticeably rushed in spots, but this was a monster movie and not Shakespeare. This is why the hurried pace of the burgeoning romance between Lawrence and Gwen Conliffe (Blunt) wasn't much of a problem for me. The shift between the slower, more suspenseful tone of the first two acts and the frenzied tone of the third one didn't bother me either. The only problem I had was John Talbot. Given his role in the narrative, it would've made this film more complete to have seen more of his story and how he goes from being a reluctant monster to a full time bastard. Yet, even if they had done this, there was still something noticeably off about this presentation.This is a remake of a film which was ancient over twenty years before I was born, and I'm no spring chicken. There was absolutely no effort made to move the story forward at all. The setting of the Moors and London, circa 1891, just didn't work for me. Yeah, they were picturesque and spooky. But they probably would've fared better had they looked more naturalistic, more contemporary, and less like a soundstage. Due to this, they only served to move this story faaar from reality. And, "An American Werewolf in London" showed how much more engaging this type of story can be when it takes place in the world we know.Speaking of AAWIL, too much of "The Wolfman" seemed to borrow from Landis' 1981 masterpiece. The tavern and its patrons looked too much like transplants from the Slaughtered Lamb?all that was missing was a pentagram and a dartboard. Then there was the werewolf rampage in London. Yet another bus was made to run over someone in order to avoid striking a snarling lycanthrope. Yet another crowd of people parted like the red sea as a monster tore through their ranks. Yet another assemblage of policemen gathered as they tried, in vain, to contain the beast.All of this leads to what was at the heart of why this movie dragged along?the monster itself. After all, what is a monster movie with a lackluster creature at its core? Despite all the work put into keeping the creature's appearance in line with the 1941 version, it just doesn't work. Yes, the transformation scene was surprisingly well thought out, with blood dripping from Talbot's mouth and hands as fangs and claws pushed their way through the skin. Yet, when I first got a clear look at the wolfman, I didn't see a werewolf. To me, it looked more like a hirsute, young republican. Seriously, a lycanthrope that's shooting the cuffs ain't scary and hasn't been since the sixties. This is why, as soon as the F/X technology allowed for it, this model was cast aside.This conceptual misstep was only compounded by the involvement of Rick Baker. If Landis was the right hand of AAWIL, then Baker was the left. He knew how outdated the traditional design had become, and was instrumental in its re-envisioning. This is why I'm shocked he would opt to take a major step backwards from his previous effort. The dude should've put his foot down and said this design wasn't going to hold up to his other werewolf film. After all, he's Rick "Futher Muckin" Baker, the guy who the Oscar committee created the makeup and F/X category for. If his opinion doesn't hold any sway, then Hollywood truly is run by flat-scans.All in all, "The Wolfman" had serviceable acting and a story that, while not entirely remarkable, was appropriately violent, moved along briskly, and did what it could. On the other hand, the setting of said story was in no way, shape, and/or form relevant to these times. Worse, the design of the monster was extremely underwhelming. If you want to see a werewolf film on the big screen, this is your only option besides (shudder) "Twilight: New Moon"?hardly any choice if you ask me. But if you want to see a great werewolf flick, stay in and watch "An American Werewolf in London", "The Howling", "Wolf", or "Dog Soldiers". Now back to the beginning, with pedestrian: (The + Wolf + Man) ? my $8.50) / 102 minutes of my time = pedestrian.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaney Can Rest Easy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught THE WOLFMAN opening night (with a mostly packed house), and it's safe to say that Lon Chaney, Jr. can sleep well in the knowledge that he's still at the top of the wolf pack.To quote my 25-year old son (who also attended), "Seventy years, and THAT'S what they've got!?"This picture only goes about 102 minutes, so it's not like Peter Jackson's drawn-out KING KONG remake, but it does seem like these guys take liberties with Curt Siodmak's original script for the sake of, well, taking liberties.As everyone knows, we're set now in 1891, and Lawrence Talbot (Benecio del Toro) is an actor touring London (after living in America with an aunt) who is contacted by Gwen when his brother Ben (her fiancé) goes missing (Lawrence had left England after witnessing his mother's 'suicide' and spending a year in an asylum to deal with it).Of course, we know Ben's dead, since he's been ripped up by a werewolf in the film's opening sequence.When Lawrence gets to the run-down Talbot Hall, he's greeted by Anthony Hopkins as Sir John (who looks like Orson Welles on Slimfast). S'John is not the intellectual rationalist here that Claude Rains portrayed in the original; rather, he's a cross between Hopkins' Van Helsing in BRAM STOKER'S DARACULA and Jack Nicholson in, well, anything. Ben's torn up body has been found in the meantime, and Lawrence is determined to find the culprit.This leads him to a traveling gypsy camp, where he's attacked during a way-over-the-top werewolf rampage (no Bela here, and Maleva is limited to three brief scenes). It takes him the better part of a month to heal up (with Gwen tending to him), and then he begins transforming himself in amped-up sequences that borrow from FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN, HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN, AN American WEREWOLF IN London, and CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF.The inspector from Scotland Yard (Hugo Weaving)--who tried to solve the Ripper murders--is dispatched to the village (called Blackmoor here), and zeroes in on Lawrence almost from the get-go. Caught after his first night of killing (some good, over-the-top stuff), Lawrence is sent to an insane asylum in London, where he escapes, and, absurdly Kong-like, reeks havoc on the city before heading back to Blackmoor.In what I found to be a really stupid plot twist, Sir John turns out to be a werewolf himself (he not only killed his son Ben because Ben planned to run off with Gwen--and Sir John wants Gwen--but he killed his wife as well, and then bit Lawrence in the gypsy camp for good measure). When the struggle between father and son becomes physical, both turn into werewolves (sorta like WEREWOLF OF London), and Lawrence/the Wolfman tosses the old boy into the fireplace where he ignites like a July 4th bonfire before being decapitated by his son's swinging paw.At this point, the inspector and Gwen arrive. The inspector is bitten--but lives!--when the Wolfman decides to chase Gwen into the forest. Gwen, armed with a pistol and silver bullets (thanks to Maleva's advice), at first tries to plead with him, but ultimately has to shoot him. Before dying, he transforms and thanks her (unnecessary, if you ask me--we get it), then expires--just in time for the inspector to feel his wound and look at the full moon. Ah, the joys of a possible sequel....On the plus side, the visuals in THE WOLFMAN are consistently good--it looks like Tim Burton's SLEEPY HOLLOW (the same designer worked both films). The score is by Danny Elfman, further giving off the Burton vibe. Rick Baker did the Wolfman make-up, and it's mostly effective. There are CG scenes where the Wolfman lopes quickly on all fours, which look absurd to me, but the critter in general is believable. The Hopkins werewolf kinda looks like Hopkins--an interesting touch, though again, I think the two-werewolf approach is nuts.The transformation scenes are CG, and they're not very realistic. Any werewolf transformation in UNDERWORLD is better. There are some flashback scenes to when Hopkins was bitten by some 'wolf boy' that would look more at home in AVATAR than here, but they don't last long.The werewolf attacks are very bloody and gory--heads ripped off, intestines spilled, splashes of blood--but the camera doesn't linger on them. You very much get the idea, though.The performances are good. Del Toro and Hopkins are playing characters very different from Chaney and Rains, and if you're familiar with the original, it's hard to get your head wrapped around that at first. But I think they're reasonably effective. Emily Blunt plays Gwen well, even when she has to do the "fired by the hand of one who loves him enough to understand" routine. Only Weaving overplays his part in my view. One can only hope any WOLFMAN sequel won't follow him.Is it scary? Not really. They rely mostly on 'jump' scenes here, and I guess they're hoping the gore will provide shocks. On the other hand, it's fun to see the Wolfman featured seriously again.Overall, I'd give it a 7 out of 10--probably a star more than non-Wolf Man fans would give it. I'm glad I saw it, but I won't drop another $10 to see it again in a theater. My biggest problem with the film is the story. I understand the DVD will offer a director's cut (the production was apparently troubled), so I'll likely be picking that up when it becomes available.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been the biggest fan of werewolf movies my whole life I've seen them all; An American werewolf in London-Paris, Ginger snaps, Van Helsing...You name it I've seen it. My utmost favourite werewolf movie of all time was the original wolfman and its sequels, and when I heard they were remaking it I was extremely excited. When all was said and done I was left feeling a bit stale but the movie wasn't without its good moments but it really feel sort of what it should have been.After being informed of his brothers death by a savage beast stage actor Lawrence Talbot returns to england to reunite with his father who he has lost touch with for a number of years. upon arriving in england Lawrence finds his brothers fiancé Gwen Conliffe unfinished with the murder of her husband. Lawrence agrees to do what ever he can to help solve the mystery of the mysterious death, after delving deep into the investigation Lawrence comes across a Gypsy camp and gets savagely attacked by a wolf like Creator.....terror follows.Let me start off with the storyline. I found many aspects good such as how they added a bad relationship between Lawrence and his father, I found they just spent to long explaining what happened and really dragged it on a bit to long. I found the movie was slow moving with not enough action and it was made to much a love story than a werewolf movie. I was glad they kept all the same characters and added some interesting new ones, they were all very well thought and designed out, it was good they kept mostly the same background and plot points of the original. I was 50/50 on the time period they choose to base the setting around, I found it worked just enough to get by and left feeling that if they made it slightly more modern it would have worked a lot better. I was really impressed by the big twist it was a huge change from the original and I didn't see it coming.The only thing I really have no complaint about was the acting; it was top notch from beginning to end. Benicio Del Toro was the perfect fit to take on the role that Lon Chaney Jr. made famous, he was tremendous and gave an excellent performance. Anthony Hopkins as Sir John was also great as most of Hopkins's work is. I really enjoyed the Abberline character portrayed by Hugo Weaving he did a wonderful job of being an irritating investigator and being a good tough guy who has no fears, one of the best performances of the movie. Emily Blunt was a good choice for Gwen Conliffe did a great job. Last but not least an A+ for Gene Simmons and David Lee Roth for the great werewolf howls.The special effects and make up were for the most part well done, I have no problems with the make up, wolfman was perfect thanks to the one and only Rick Baker. The special effects were okay, I found at points it was easy to tell it was fake but overall not a bad job. Props were good and sets were well thought out. The biggest problem I had with the effects was when the wolfman would switch from walking on two legs to all fours it just really doesn't look right.Overall not a bad remake or bad movie for that matter, biggest flaws exist in the storyline could have really used less love and back stories and used a lot more wolfman. One things for sure it's definitely worth a watch and even though I wasn't as impressed as I was hoping I have still watched it more than a couple of times. I will always love werewolf movies and I look forward to the next one. So make sure you at least give this movie a try.Overall Rating: ****** out of ********** *** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wolfman entertains!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must confess that I haven't seen the original Wolfman movie, aside from seeing a few clips of it here and there in the trailers, so I am not in the position to compare the original and this remake together. However after watching this remake without having any knowledge about the original I would say this movie definitely entertains.The Story is quite simplistic and very easy to follow. Lawrence's brother is killed by a wild beast and a letter from his fiancé drives Lawrence to come back to the town to investigate his brothers death. Saying anything beyond this point would be ruining the fun in the story so lets just leave it at that.The acting in the movie is quite fantastic. Benicio Del Toro who plays as "Lawrence" in the movie does a fantastic job, he is the type of actor who doesn't have to say much but the expressions on his face and the body language speaks for itself, in short he was well cast for the role that he plays in the movie. Anthony Hopkins is his usual self playing the part with ease and fits well as Lawrence's father. Emily blunt does add a little to the story, but isn't provided with much to do. The movie has fantastic sets and the CGI looks Absolutely amazing.This movie is panned by many critics and viewers, I found nothing wrong with the movie to be honest, it was done quite well, the movie bombed at the Box office considering it used the Budget of $150 Million and earned only $139 Million worldwide.After seeing quite many horror movies, I have to say that this movie went a bit overboard on spending too much on the CGI stuff, seriously $150 Million for a horror movie? This movie wouldn't have bombed at the Box office if it didn't use this much production budget and could have managed to become a hit. Good horror movies rely on creepy atmosphere, tension building scenes and good acting, this movie has all those, they didn't need to have spend too much on the CGI, movies like Paranormal Activity, Poltergeist, Nightmare on Elm Street and others that were a success with a small budget is a proof of that.It is most certainly not the best horror movie you would ever see, but it certainly ain't that bad as others make it out to be. 6.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Wolfman Ever !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of Universal's Wolfman is a fantastic production.The story is very similar to the original Wolfman with Lawrence Talbot who gets bitten by a wolf and ends up living as a werewolf for the rest of his days. It's a much bigger production, and the special effects are lot better than the 60 year old classic. Story is really well fleshed out with each of the characters having more depth than the original.I'm not a big fan of movies of this type, but this one surprised me with its quality. While I was watching, I had the strangest notion "Which of these guys, the werewolf or the humans that are more savage than the other ?". Torture, condemnation, and more torture was waiting for Lawrence once the word was out.This by far is the best of the wolfman/werewolf movie I've seen, and is worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many viewers believed that the movie did not filled their expectations. I'm not one of them. The Wolfman was an excellent movie; abiding by tradition and adding an interesting twist to the legend through Anthony Hopkin's character. I admit that Del Toro's acting could have been better, but probably he chose to maintain his character within the boundaries of Lon Chaney's gloomy performance on the Universal's series. The direction was very good, the photography excellent,special effects and settings were extraordinary. The acting was solid, specially the renditions of Emily Blunt and David Schofield. Geraldine Chaplin also portrayed the gypsy woman, Maleva, with uncanny accuracy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Worthy Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I get into the review itself, I'd like to say that like many, I'm surprised by the number of negative reviews. It seems like this is happening more and more as IMDb is fractured between the huge 'Echo Boom' generation with no attention span for movies that don't have non-stop video game like action, and the smaller (but also Internet active) Generation X reviewers.Also, my review is of the *unrated* version - perhaps that accounts for some of the difference. I do not know how that version differs from the theatrical release, so please bear that in mind.Now to the review - I for one see this as a very worthy sequel to the original Wolfman (which is one of the best of the Universal monsters series).It features great performances all around - and particularly by Anthony Hopkins as the elder Talbot. And while Benecio Del Toro is a curious casting choice, and certainly a far cry from Lon Chaney Jr., he's not bad either, once you see how the character has been interpreted here.In fact the only performance that I think the original had over this one was the Gypsy cred of Maria Ouspenskaya as Maleva, played much more flatly by a miscast Geraldine Chaplin.The story is similar to the original, but differs enough to entertain even those who've seen the 1941 version a multitude of times. Also, like the original, it is dripping in moody atmosphere. From the moors of rural Britain to the heart of Victorian London, the attention to detail here is incredible, including references to Gévaudan, 'lunatics', Jack-the-Ripper, Scotland Yard, lycanthropy, etc.It also features some of the best werewolf transformations in recent film history.Ultimately, though, the film makes it's stand on exploring the beast inside man issue and the acting, facade we all hold up to present ourselves as civilized rather than a step above the animal. Sir John Talbot is a big game hunter, as cruel and vicious in his own way as the animals he hunts, and Lawrence Talbot is an actor, very good at hiding the emotions he harbors inside.This is not just your blood-and-guts werewolf film (all though it has plenty of that - especially in the deleted scenes, which hopefully one day will be added back in), it is cerebral, and akin to the classic horror films of the black and white era - but with enough modern sophistication and luridness to balance it out.Well worth your time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw it with the lights on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I liked about this film: Rick Baker's work did not disappoint. The Wolfman was scary as heck and I had to watch the movie with the lights on. Baker deserved his statue. Emma, the love interest, wasn't written as a modern day woman stuck in the wrong time period. She wasn't a martial arts/weapons expert hell bent on kicking butt. She was portrayed as a woman of the times; and she did research to help her friend. Anthony Hopkins never disappoints. He could read the phone book and be good at it. The part I felt was most frightening wasn't the scenes of blood and violence, but the "therapy" Laurence went through. It was scary because it was real and it happened. As much as I enjoyed the film, I won't allow my daughter (she's 9) to watch it any time soon. It's far too gory and violent. What I didn't like: The volume.

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable period horror film that should not be taken seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Straight up The Wolfman is not perfect but it is fun. Its bloody, action packed and throws in a couple of jump scares for good measure. Personally I don't understand the hate the film has been receiving, sure Benicio del Toro is miscast but there is nothing awful about the film. The film starts bleakly and it takes time to adjust to how dark the film. A son has been killed and the other brother has come to visit the father in the country mansion. It is fair to say that the story isn't entirely strong or engaging. In fact it takes time for the action to begin but when it does, the film finds itself and becomes enjoyable to watch.While Benicio's casting decision is odd and his accent isn't perfect, he does a decent job. It is Anthony Hopkins and Hugo Weaving who give the film its energy whenever they are on screen. Emily Blunt while not terrible, suffers the most from the average script and doesn't have the same screen presence as Hopkins or Weaving. Those who watch the director's cut will get to see Max Von Sydow make a brief cameo.However the real star is the Academy Award winning make-up, which is a welcome break from CGI. While CGI maybe present in some scenes, it is there only to add to the story and is not there for the sake of it. After seeing hundreds of soldiers in the last Rambo film being digitally torn apart, it was refreshing to see make-up being used instead.The Wolfman is not a film to be seen with high expectations but it is worth watching if you are in search of something entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, it's flawed, but the performances, and design of the film make up for it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the classic Universal horror, The Wolfman centers on Lawrence Talbot (Played by Benicio Del Toro), who has returned to London after many years of living, and performing in Shakespearean plays in America, due to the news of a mysterious creature's fatal attack on his brother, to which his father (Played by Anthony Hopkins) seems unreactive towards. He tries to get to the bottom of the case, but is bitten by a werewolf, and now bears the mark, meaning that he shall become a hideous wolfman on a full moon's night.The film is directed by Joe Johnston, who's known for visually impressive, but conceptually thin movies such as Jumanji and Jurassic Park III. The Wolfman is more of the same, but actually tries it's hardest to provide a good story, the key word being tries. Character and story arcs are shaky, and occasionally sporadic, but much of the film's cast are impressive, and there's enough gory action to balance things out.As far as visually impressive, I really do mean it. The film is shot broodingly by Shelly Johnson, who will sometimes stylize shots with dim candles, and the creepy forests, mansions, and villages are excellently designed by Rick Heinrichs, but the biggest praise I have for the film is the artistry by makeup effects LEGEND Rick Baker.Aside from the awesome skin, fur, claws, fangs, and drool of the title creature, you've also got goatees, lovely hair styles, and bloody and exhausted faces. It's pure genius, and it's great to see Baker back and doing what he does best. He even gets a short cameo... and I mean short.The Wolfman shouldn't be mistaken for a good movie, but it can be acknowledged to be a very enjoyable movie.I give it **1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't like horror films, plain and simple. Vampires, werewolves, mummies, forgotten creatures from the depths, none of them do a thing for me, especially when they try to modernize medieval myths and add scientific explanations for the magical origins of such creatures. Fortunately for The Wolfman it makes no attempt to modernize lycanthropes, instead it faithfully depicts the story of the werewolf in a gorgeous late 19th century England. Full of period detail and wonderfully acted by Benico Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, and Hugo Weaving, the movie really comes to life as a tragic tale of a family that has been cursed. The werewolf is brutal, savage, and frighteningly powerful and his rampages are indeed gory but they are not gratuitous. The CG is good but not great, but the effective use of music, cinematography, and outstanding acting make up for it. The Wolfman is a beautifully created period piece that far outshines the typical Hollywood tripe from this genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Magnificent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is truly a magnificent work of art. The location and costume design is perfectly matched to the year in which it takes place. The director has mastered the filming of this movie with dark imagery that represents this era in history. People during this time were very superstitious and with good reason. Benicio Del Toro is the perfect character for Lawrence Talbot. His appearance is matched directly with that of a troubled man, torn from within. The only other actor that could compare with him for the part, would be Johnny Depp, and he has enough on his plate now. Personally, I would have liked to have seen a little more drama between his character and the lead female actor, but it was beautifully coordinated, leaving the audience wanting more. I will be purchasing this movie to go with my collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Polished and well made, but lacking the intensity factor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>|Credit IMDb for the plot| Lawrence Talbot's childhood ended the night his mother died. His father sent him from the sleepy Victorian hamlet of Blackmoor to an insane asylum, then he goes to America. When his brother's fiancée, Gwen Conliffe, tracks him down to help find her missing love, Talbot returns to his father's estate to learn that his brother's mauled body has been found. Reunited with his estranged father, Lawrence sets out to find his brother's killer... and discovers a horrifying destiny for himself. Someone or something with brute strength and insatiable blood lust has been killing the villagers, and a suspicious Scotland Yard inspector named Aberline comes to investigate.I'll give credit where credit is due. This is certainly polished looking, and very well done. But as I was watching it, I couldn't help but sense a lack of thrills in the whole scheme of things. I was never really bored, but never really engaged like it wanted to lead me to believe. The atmosphere is certainly impressive, and captures the original's essence nicely. Benicio and Anthony Hopkins channel Rains and Chaney respectively, quite impressively. One intense torture sequence involving Hopkins and Del Toro was the highlight of the movie for me.Performances. Benicio Del Toro plays a good Talbot for the most part. He played it low-key, and gave a good show. Anthony Hopkins is on the ball here. His intensity was always a blast to watch. Emily Blunt is OK as the love interest, and played her part adequately.Bottom line. It passed the time decently enough, but it was rather underwhelming like most remakes. It tried so hard to be intense, that at times I think it was obvious the filmmakers were trying too hard. Worth a look, but that's about it.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flat, nothing new</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A year or so ago, when I learned that Benicio del Toro was going to star in a remake of The Wolf Man, I anticipated an excellent period piece dripping with horror and suspense. But the remake, from the guy who directed one of the non-Spielberg Jurassic Parks, is so straightforward as to lose most of its menace. It's a flat, almost expressionless rendition of a classic movie monster, and it's a darn shame. Del Toro plays Lawrence Talbot, an American returning to his ancestral home in Blackmoor, England, where he finds that the old mansion looks like it was bombed and is inhabited by just his father (Anthony Hopkins) and a few servants. His brother has been brutally murdered, leaving a widow (Emily Blunt) who implores Lawrence to look into matters more closely, as everyone in the village seems to think a beast or a bear or something did it.The movie follows the legendary 1941 movie's script fairly closely, and that may be the problem: there's just not a lot new about this version. The atmosphere's the same, the scenes are virtually the same, and so it lacks that sense of newness that original movies have. Now, of course, it's a remake, so it shouldn't be a reinvention of the story, but it might have been better served as a slight reimagining. Instead, what we get is largely familiar territory, so much so that Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay explicitly includes Jack the Ripper as part of the Wolf Man's universe; Talbot and his family are investigated by none other than Inspector Abbeline, well played here by Hugo Weaving and played in the Ripper film From Hell by Johnny Depp. Abberline's appearance, rather than that of a generic inspector type, is an attempt to add even more to the spooky turn-of-the-century-Britain atmosphere, and it just feels like a stretch instead of an enriching detail.The entire cast is effective, particularly Blunt as the only one who can (predictably) save Lawrence Talbot from himself and his family's curse. Blunt's work here is better than you might expect for the role. She's pretty and has a strong screen presence, which is more than you can say for your average ingénue. Del Toro, too, is much better than you'd expect him to be, as well; he's always been a pretty good actor, certainly (Traffic, The Usual Suspects), but he's more evocative here than usual. And Anthony Hopkins is Anthony Hopkins, although he does occasionally lapse into uncharacteristic hamminess.Here are two caveats. For one thing, Del Toro doesn't become the monster until well, well into the film. You don't get to see any monster until the movie's well underway, and what's the point of that? It's not terribly scary without there being a monster. Secondly, and this is weird, but the makeup for Wolfie himself looks a little artificial. That's weird because it was concocted by none other than the well regarded Rick Baker. It's 2010, and the effect of man changing into beast looked straight out of An American Werewolf in London.Bottom line: The Wolfman is not a bad film; it's just not particularly memorable, more of a footnote to otherwise well-remembered careers, except for the director's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not truly great, but surely one of the best werewolf-films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't expect much of this one, but I was pleasantly surprised by "The Wolfman".First of all, I was delighted that they produced it as a period piece. Classic horror-tales (and what could be more classic than a werewolf-movie?) seem to work best when set in Victorian England. The dialog, mannerisms and gorgeous production design are spot on - as is the casting. Del Torro's unusual looks serve him well here - even when he's not in a horror-film he always has something of an animal about him.I was also thrilled to see that they didn't try to make this show into a PG-13-affair. If you like your horror-flicks juicy, you'll probably love The Wolfman. If only some of the other classic 30s-monsters (The Mummy, Dracula, Frankenstein) had gotten a similar treatment for their reboots. Speaking of which: It's also a good thing that this movie takes itself seriously. Unlike "The Mummy", which never dared to be a true horror-movie and wound up as weird adventure-flick with bad dialog, tacky "humor" and a disappointing creature, The Wolfman never winks at the audience or shies away from the gruesome nature of its subject. After all: Getting attacked by a werewolf should result in a bloody mess."The Wolfman" isn't without flaws though: Strangely enough, the story lacks the ultimate thrill that I'd expect from an old fashioned horror-film. There are some attempts to lure the audience into false security and then shock them out of their seats, but those announce themselves well in advance and thus never quite work. Especially the nightmare-sequences were done much better and more effective (read: scarier) in "An American Werewolf in London". The creature itself looks great and the transformation scenes are pretty solid as well. However: The full werewolf running over rooftops looks too obviously like a CGI-sequence. Other CGI-effects are a mixed bag as well: There's a bear and a deer who both look about as real as the gopher and monkeys in Indiana Jones 4.So in short: While I still prefer other werewolf-films (An American Werewolf in London, Wolfen), this one's far from being a stinker. It's way better than recent attempts at the subject such as "Twilight" (*shudder*) or those dreadful "Underworld"-flicks. If you like your horror classic, your setting and characters dark and your monster-attacks gory, you should check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank god, a REAL Wolf-Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sooo tired of werewolves that look like a cross between wolves and bears. Finally we have a return to the source. a human-wolf hybrid. A werewolf that walks upright, and when he needs to for speed, does so on all fours. And we don't have any hair gelled teen aged "monsters" who are pretty boys looking to fight over a mediocre looking chick. This is a monster movie. The WOLFMAN is a MONSTER!!!! He tears people apart with claws and fangs. And he looks scary. I hate the new trend in monster movies "vote for who's more cute...vampire or werewolf". Until this film came out, there hadn't been monsters in monster movies for a long time. I hope this marks the beginning of then end of the pretty boy monsters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I am what they say I am. I'm a monster."I have no experience with classic monster movies like The Mummy, The Creature from the Black Lagoon, and the original Wolfman. I hadn't even been thought of yet when they were originally released, and I never had much desire to catch up on them later. So, I can't compare this new movie to them. All I knew was that any movie with Emily Blunt in it couldn't be all that bad. I really had very little expectations for this movie.&nbsp;And despite a disappointing lack of heaving bosoms in Victorian corsets (a sadly missed opportunity, there), this movie was better than I had hoped. It's campy, that much goes without saying. But The Wolfman is that perfect blend of unintentional campiness and adequate film-making that manages to be pretty enjoyable. All the gore is copious and not the slightest bit realistic, the story is almost charming in its predictability, and most of the actors keep one expression on their face for the entire movie. Del Toro looks blank and very Del Toro-y, Emily Blunt furrows her pretty brow so constantly that I worried about her developing wrinkles right there on the spot, and Anthony Hopkins doesn't even bother to not look sinister. It's a treat to watch, it really is. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;So yeah, I liked it. This wasn't a outstanding achievement in film, by any means, but it was fun. If you watch The Wolfman with any expectations of seeing a serious horror movie, then you're basically guaranteed to be disappointed. Get together with a few friends and get yourself into a "Mystery Science Theater" kind of mood, however, and you'll have a ball.&nbsp;At the very least, you get to see a fight between a werewolf in a vest and a werewolf that's on fire. Who can say no to that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Or does it? We have clearly crossed the line with this movie classic. I almost wonder whether seeing the upcoming Creature from the Black Lagoon remake will be worth it.. and the problem is not plot as much as it is story-telling technique. Now that we have truly good cgi, we can see the monster at its most fantastic but without suspense. I think the problem has to be time, movie-makers are stuck on the idea of keeping films short and as a result something has to suffer. Honestly, Sam Raimi makes better horror, showing less, or just glimpses and drawing out the suspense.But enough of that, if you haven't already seen this movie, this is what to expect: a good cast, wonderful photography, great cgi and a story that leaves you wishing there was more exposition and introspection. Anthony Hopkins is absolutely great, I was very pleased with his performance. Benicio is not as memorial in this role as he was in Sin City as Jackie Boy, but then different character. The Lawrence Talbot character is a man supposedly haunted by a terrible past. Again, a missed chance - more exposition please! Movie-makers rethink your time limits!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Cinema Fun. Scary And Amusing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i think i loved this mostly for the classic early forties universal logo at the beginning and the obligatory shots of clouds rolling past the full moon like in the original 'Werewolf' with Lon Chaney.i don't think a lot of the people who criticized this film so harshly understood how evocative it was of the original film. Benicio Del Toro's performance was an impression of Lon Chaney Jr. who, in his early years, was a somewhat wooden and stilted actor. he was fun in the original 'wolfman' role, but there was always something sort of wooden about him (Chaney was actually better years later in 'Spider Baby'). the sets, the cinematography, the whole mood of the production was meant to evoke and recall memories of the original Universal film classic. i thought they did an excellent job. it was also nice to know the right studio was chosen to produce this project as well.i can't really pretend that director Joe Johnston makes great "art" films, but films like Disney's 'Rocketeer' and 'Honey i Shrunk the Kids', or his other films like the ground breaking CGI film of Van Allsburg's 'Jumanji', have always been solidly professional entertainment.this film was a terrific homage to the great Universal horror flicks of the thirties and forties, and a lot of scary fun. the scenes toward the end when they try to "cure" del Toro's lycanthropy, were intense and amusing. all in all it's nice to know that "wolfie" has still got it after all these years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wolfman A Decent Horror Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wolfman is a decent horror remake that has some flaws which I'll get into later but I thought the film's all right for what it is though. Director Joe Johnston is admirable in making this movie giving audiences just enough gore, blood, guts, and limbs being torn off for guilty pleasure. Benicio Del Toro is okay as the lead Laurnece Talbot an actor who returns to his ancestral homeland to uncover the truth of what happened to his brother Ben when he's found mauled to death by some bloody thirst animal on the rampage. Del Toro may not win any awards for the role and it it may not be his best performance but he's still good as the cursed Laurence none the less. The same can go for Anthony Hopkins as Laurence's estranged father Sir John who doesn't exactly seem too guilt stricken over the loss the loss of his son Ben. Hopkins is a great actor there's no denying that and he brings what he can to the role of John despite not being given a whole to do except for late in the third act. Emily Blunt turns in fairly decent performance as Ben's widow Gwen who begins to grow feelings for Laurence. I haven't seen Blunt in a lot of movies except for Sunshine Cleaning and Dan In Real Life but she's believable as Gwen who's desperately looking for the truth behind Ben's brutal death and asks Laurence for help. Hugo Weaving is good as Inspector Abberline in his limited screen time who like Hopkins doesn't have a lot to do. Weaving however makes the best of the role he does have in the film. I think one of his most memorable characters will always be as the villain Agent Smith from The Matrix movies but he still turns in a solid performance as Abberline who is on the hunt for the "killer" responsible for slaughtering villagers at night during a full moon. The rest of the cast are okay but no one stands out. The action sequences mostly involving the wolf-man brutally killing people are well executed which is sure to please horror junkies who enjoy watching characters getting their limbs, heads, and other body parts torn apart by a creature that mauls any poor soul caught in it's path. The pacing of the film was fine and this is certainly one of the better remakes that are being re-imagined these days. I'd rather watch this than Friday the 13th, Halloween, or The Omen to name a few. I liked how we only get glimpses of the wolf-man for the first half before Johnston gives us a full view of the creature. I thought it was more effective that way instead of showing audiences the wolf-man up close within the first five minutes and the Gothic mood was fitting for the film. The location they chose was also quite good. It added a lot to the movie and the atmosphere created some suspenseful moments when the wolf-man was on the loose. The movie itself and some scenes felt a little rushed even with a running time of 103 minutes. I haven't watched the directors cut yet. Some predictable moments did weigh down the film somewhat. There's also a scene near the end that seemed a bit anti-climatic and it's kind of over before you could really enjoy the fight but I guess it worked for the film. Overall The Wolfman is a decent remake that will probably please horror junkies who enjoy movies of this genre. So if you're one of these people, chances are you'll enjoy The Wolfman. It has just enough action, blood, guts, gore, drama, and solid performances from the cast (Del Toro, Hopkins, Blunt, and Weaving) who make this remake worth watching at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Even a man who is pure in heart..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On paper, the new version of Universal's classic monster film The Wolf Man was always a more solid project compared to remakes of Japanese shockers (The Ring etc.) or Michael Bay-produced "reboots" of Friday 13th and other gory franchises, and the reason is the makers - primarily star and co-producer Benicio Del Toro - didn't make it for financial reasons, but because of a genuine passion for the material (the original, starring Lon Chaney Jr., is said to be Del Toro's favorite movie). Then came the usual reports of a troubled production, with first-choice director Mark Romanek leaving and being replaced at the last minute with the not always brilliant Joe Johnston (his last effects-heavy work was the disappointing Jurassic Park III). It is quite surprising, then, that the finished film is more of a labor of love than a studio-imposed compromise: flawed, no doubt, but gritty and exciting all the way through.With no literary sources demanding fidelity (the excuse for the latest major re-imaginings of Dracula and Frankenstein), the script by Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self sticks to the 1940s blueprint with some minor modifications: Lawrence Talbot (Del Toro) returns home after a protracted absence to find out the truth about his brother's death. He is greeted quite coldly by his eccentric father (Anthony Hopkins), whereas his brother's fiancée Gwen (Emily Blunt) gets worryingly close to him. The one night, while visiting a gypsy camp, Lawrence is attacked by an unknown beast, and soon finds himself bearing the mark of an ageless curse, which manifests itself with the full moon.Like its predecessors (Coppola's Dracula and Branagh's Frankenstein), the new Wolfman puts a lot of effort in its atmosphere, and it pays off with a superb recreation of Victorian England, eerie cinematography and a chilling score by Danny Elfman. It also shares the aforementioned films' sense of postmodern playfulness by having one character (Inspector Abberline, played by Hugo Weaving) come from another macabre story (the very real case of Jack the Ripper) and providing its own spin on the joke of Talbot's father being played by another cinematic monster (Claude "The Invisible Man" Rains back in the day, Hannibal Lecter in 2010). However, the attempt to modernize the film also leads to its one major weakness, namely a third act that becomes a conventional action movie, rather than the riveting character piece it was up to that point.Fortunately, the strength of the characterizations outweighs the occasionally thin plotting, thanks to excellent performances: the brooding Del Toro, the worried Blunt, the bizarre Weaving and the raving mad Hopkins (always a pleasure to watch) form a flawless ensemble, supported by Geraldine Chaplin's nostalgic cameo as a gypsy ( the famous poem and cane are also present). Naturally, the film's weight rests largely on Del Toro's shoulders, and he delivers both as the tormented Talbot and as the fierce werewolf, an astounding creation thanks to Rick Baker's CGI-free make-up work. Whereas other remakes just aim for meaningless scares, this one works because the people involved always try to get it right, and it is to Johnston's credit that he didn't go for a PG-13 rating: the scary bits are really scary, courtesy of a savvy mix of suspense and bloodletting, with the occasional touch of dark humor (John Landis, anyone?).Good acting, a remarkably decent script and a genuinely frightening monster: that's what The Wolfman has going for it. Sure, the original is better, but that was a given from the very beginning, wasn't it?</fullReview>

She isn't some world class actor for me because she didn't show some will . I couldn't see some good acting in this movie by her . She looked quite uninterested . There were only her stupid movements . Her calm acting in some moments looked well . I think that she couldn't do even better . Her acting brought only lack of romance which improved this movie .Hugo Weaving was good in this movie . His appearance was very nice . I think that he showed one lesson how to act well . He was calm and really disciplined . He was always on level and he was very calm . He behaved like one mister . This historical role was definitely for him . I don't think that it was like his acting in V for Vendetta but it was quite good no matter what he was too little in this movie .This movie isn't for recommendation but it is quite acceptable . It has nice story but it isn't well showed . Cast disappointed me .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the less than flattering reviews, I avoided this film at the theater when it came out. I did, however rent it and was surprised. Being a great fan of the original Universal "Wolfman" I expected to be utterly disappointed. In some ways I definitely was but in others I was impressed. The film tries hard to invoke the "fog shrouded moors" of the original, even going so far as to place the film earlier, in Victorian times. I thought this aspect of the movie was very effective. The sets, both interior and exterior, are impressive. Also, the sense of doom and dread that pervaded the original is there. You know from the opening scene this is not a story with a happy ending. The acting is oddly flat; Im not sure why but no one involved seem to put much "oomph" into their performance. But there are some very effective and frightening scenes. Far more bloody than was necessary, of course, but that is the nature of modern horror films. Overall I enjoyed the movie much more than I anticipated. It's not on the level of "An American Werewolf in London" or even "The Howling" but its worth watching, in my opinion. And it's still better than "Ginger Snaps".</fullReview>

However, I was pleasantly surprised.The film stays completely faithful to the spirit and sensibilities of the old Universal pictures and doesn't try to retell the story with modern-day cynicism. This, if anything, makes it seem more exotic.The film looks great and I actually liked what the make-up artists did with the werewolves, unlike many. My only gripe is that Del Toro does seem uncomfortable in his part. However, Hopkins, who I've sometimes criticised in the past, is really, really good in my view. I enjoyed every second he was on screen.If the story was less predictable and a little bolder, I'd give this an even higher rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Werewolves. My true love and my true fear. It all started with The Wolf Man in 1941. Since then no monster really got a grip on my fear like the hairy beast. There's no doubt a sense of tragedy involved that did in fact travel to this film. I tried to vote 8.5 but only whole numbers were allowed. Wow, anytime you see Anthony Hopkins involved you know that the Director and the financial backers are serious. I felt and saw all elements of the original film included here. It does differ somewhat by going up and beyond the 60 year old flick but it never truly abandons the gut feeling of the original. Hat's off to all of you who brought forth the old black and white feeling into the modern age!!! Great special effects, fantastic storyline, top-notch actors and a truly ground breaking performance that crosses the lines of sci-fi horror with true love drama. Don't miss this one! You'll be very very entertained!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually I am not much of a fan of old movies being re-made. But "The Wolfman" was actually a quite nice re-make. Usually when Hollywood decides to tamper with old classics, the results are something that would have been better off never having seen the light of day.Anyone, and I assume most people, familiar with the classic "Wolfman" movie will most likely find this to be a good take on the classic story. There are many similarities and lots of new stuff in here as well. It all works well for a re-make of this sort.As for the cast, well that was great. They managed to get a good handful of skilled actors together for this movie.The effects are good and believable, unlike many of the numerous werewolf movies out there. And the appearance of the wolfman in this re-make is very similar to the classic wolfman, so I think that was really good. Not a good thing to stray too far from the original and come up with something new in a re-make. Then not much of a re-make then is it? Well, I found the movie to be entertaining and exciting. There was nothing scary in the movie for me, but there might be some viewers who will get a thrill from some of the numerous scenes with the wolfman.I think, that people familiar with the classic movie, will find this movie to be good and entertaining. While new audiences will be introduced to a very believable and strong tale of the wolfman and lycanthropy.As with the older movie, this is so much more than just a werewolf movie.If you liked the classic movie or if you are a fan of werewolf movies, then you definitely have to check out this 2010 re-make of a superb classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delight for old school horror fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1891, Lawrence Talbot is summoned back to his ancestral homeland after a family tragedy. He is bitten and subsequently turns into a cursed werewolf during a full moon.The Wolfman is a fanciful looking film and a good remake of The Wolf Man (1941). It also has a reminiscent atmosphere of the old Hammer movies.Joe Johnston proves once again he is a more than effective director. As a bonus werewolf effects veteran Rick Baker provides many of the special make-up effects and a brief cameo. Danny Elfman gives a wonderful and fitting score, the whole film has a great Gothic ambiance to it.Anthony Hopkins (who I usually love) as Sir John Talbot comes across lazy and uninspiring in this particular role and at times the film is too CGI driven. Nevertheless, Benicio Del Toro is the perfect Wolfman and Hugo Weaving is ideal as the witty Scotland yard Inspector who has some great moments although few and far between.It doesn't have the crispness of Branagh's Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, but is far more enjoyable, intricate and realised than Coppola's Dracula.For old school horror monster fans it's a delight. All in all it's a fitting retelling of a classic monster movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wolfman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not gonna rip on a film that gave me everything I could possibly want in a theatrical experience. As pure Gothic horror, it not only lived up to my expectations but exceeded as I was in sheer delight by every moment I was in my seat, taking it all in. Turn-of-the-century London, Blackmoor Castle(..or Talbot Castle), the fog-engulfed moors, not one but TWO werewolves ripping men limb-from-limb, the wolfman rampaging throughout London, moving atop buildings and across streets of frightened people, the impossibly beautiful Emily Blunt evocatively photographed as Gwen Conliffe(..Talbot's brother's widow), the tormented Shakespearean actor Lawrence Talbot(..Benicio Del Toro, eschewing the proper pathos needed for such a role, portraying a haunted man undeserving of his heritage and calamity)enduring all types of horror, Anthony Hopkins(..as the patriarch, Sir John Talbot of a cob-webbed castle whose every corner echoes gloom and doom)with his menacing eyes and cold-blooded stare, bone-crackling body transformation sequences where we witness the agonizing pain Lawrence must tolerate, unable to stop the beast from emerging, the great Geraldine Chaplin a grotesque gypsy Maleva whose purpose is to dispel the bad news that all hope is lost when one is bitten by a verevolvf, and all the treasures and visual splendor the English countryside can provide. Even the computer generated effects surpassed my expectations. And, we get plenty of grisly thrills as the werewolf violence delivers plenty of human carnage at the hands of the ferocious beast(s). We even get a battle between werewolves as the castle for which they are fighting is engulfed in flames. There were many who complained about not being overwhelmed or surprised, getting exactly what they expected and nothing else, well, it's too bad disappointed viewers couldn't enjoy a movie geared towards Gothic horror fans of the great Universal Studios, because "The Wolfman" is aimed at that particular audience. I haven't the foggiest notion why horror fans can not simply enjoy a movie made especially for them. I, for one, was suitably entertained and enthralled with the final product and certainly appreciated a movie geared towards those of us who still enjoy a movie set in another period, with a Danny Elfman score sumptuous enough to address the Gothic trappings, shot by a fluid camera that doesn't shake and jerk, with dialogue that actually sounds like it was penned by people with a degree of intelligence, and acted with a subtlety and richness that's been lacking in horror for sometime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Update on Cult Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with the obvious fears of not wanting this to turn out like Jack's Wolf from the 90's, I was very happy with this film in every respect.Worthy cast, Rick Baker back to do what he does best with the Effects and even a cameo!!! I especially loved the period setting and the dark tone of the film was just what I wanted. I have not seen a Horror/Wolfman pic of this Calibre before, I will certainly get the DVD. Del Toro is great, the plot really is irrelevant unless your from Mars... Its about the best you can expect from a well used franchise like the Wolfman. There are some genuinely gripping moments in the wolfout/chase sequences.Cult classic, no such thing exists in films these days, but it comes pretty damn close!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the Wolfman, what more could you want?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I am kind of surprised at some of the reviews that this film is getting. Bottom line, its the Wolfman, how much better could it be without drastically changing the story to the point where its not just a re-imagining of the original, but a new movie all together. This movie started great, not slow like most were saying, sets the tone perfect. Depicted old style UK like all movies set in that period do, very well in fact. after story progresses it does seem like the full moons come a little too often, maybe they should have dropped the full moon requirement when they re-imagined this. Anthony Hopkins was fantastic in this, the twist that he is a werewolf too and is the culprit werewolf that started it all is just the best! Movie could have covered more ground overall, but was still good as is. Anyone who likes werewolves will love this movie. I know i did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Wolfman" is a fun B-movie romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a time when Hollywood studios made, perhaps not proudly, but unabashedly, movies that they were not afraid to refer to as B-movies. They were not the cream of the crop, didn't star the biggest names, were made for lower budgets than the crown jewels, and generally featured somewhat, well, pulpier subject matter. Some time ago, Hollywood seemed to stop intentionally making B-movies, largely perhaps due to rising budgets that prevent them from identifying movies as anything but a major production, however, Universal's The Wolfman proves that B-movies are alive, at least in spirit, in the modern film world, albeit with huge budgets, name actors and elaborate production values, but where it really counts, the final amalgamation of all the pieces, The Wolfman is a B-movie through and through, and a gloriously entertaining one at that.The Wolfman is a remake of one of Universal's staple horror films from the '30s, centering around Lawrence Talbot (Benicio del Toro), a traveling actor who is asked to visit home by his brother's wife to be, Gwen (Emily Blunt), after her fiancé has gone missing. When Lawrence arrives home at Talbot Hall on the moors of England, he discovers that his brother has been found dead and begins to investigate what happened to him. He interacts with his estranged father, Sir John (Anthony Hopkins) for the first time in years, and also runs afoul of an investigator from Scotland Yard, Francis Abberline (Hugo Weaving) who is investigating the death. When visiting a nearby Gypsy camp one night, it is attacked by a vicious creature that kills several Gypsies and injures Lawrence, who convalesces quickly and begins having strange visions. He quickly discovers that he was attacked by a werewolf, and that the bite he sustained has passed the curse of the werewolf on to him, which takes hold of him when the moon is full, transforming him into a fearsome killing beast, half-man, half-wolf. Lawrence must now try to avoid Abberline, who wants to take him in, protect Gwen, whom is developing affection for, and discover who it was that infected him.The Wolfman has been produced in the style of Gothic horror films of the past. Almost every frame is absolutely dripping with atmosphere, thanks to the work of production designer Rick Heinrichs, director of photography Shelly Johnson and composer Danny Elfman. Filled with foggy forests, elaborate English manors, overcast skies and interiors lit by candles, The Wolfman is marvelous to look at. Into this environment, The Wolfman itself is a mix of old and new techniques, makeup effects by master make-up artist Rick Baker and more modern CG animation for some scenes of The Wolfman in action. Some of the effects are a bit hokey at times, but the bulk of it works well enough to not be distracting.In addition to its good looks, The Wolfman provides a narrative that is hardly ground breaking, but features enough strong moments to be engaging. Director Joe Johnson has assembled some strong set-pieces, such as the Gypsy camp attack, Lawrence's romp across London rooftops and the fire-infused finale, to keep your attention on the screen. The character development is a bit lacking, but the performers do a good enough job inhabiting their roles to give us some attachment to the goings on. Special note on the acting front can be given to Del Toro and Hopkins, both who give strong turns in their roles, Del Toro infusing Lawrence with a brooding, tortured soul, and Hopkins makes Sir John a man who seems a bit out of touch with reality, mixing in the right hint of menace when necessary. Emily Blunt isn't given a lot to do, but still manages to equate herself well enough as Gwen, and Hugo Weaving gets some of the film's gallows humor for many of his scenes as inspector Abberline.The Wolfman doesn't pull any punches on the blood and gore front, it provides enough of it to properly earn it's R rating, but it works in context with the material. The Wolfman is a movie that isn't high art, but isn't intended to be either, it is a glorious throwback to yesteryear, when movies about werewolves were made by studios with the sole purpose of being a low-brow, meat and potatoes horror film, and The Wolman does a good job of providing modern audiences with that kind of entertaining package.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has the makings of a classic, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unless you've been living under a rock, then you know that Hollywood is real big on updating classic films. Whether you're for them or against them, they're definitely profitable right now and will likely continue to be made until the masses tire of them. Fortunately some of them have turned out to be rather good, while others are just not worth the effort. A lot of the films, especially Horror, that have been remade were independent films made from the heart. A lot of the remakes have been polished and hollow, lacking what made the originals so good and memorable. But even in some of these big Hollywood remakes you can see some heart in there. This update of the 1941 Universal classic had a super troubled production and could have ended up a mess of gigantic proportions, but did it? Surprisingly no and all things considered it's pretty darn good, just not great.Pros: Solid performances all around. Another great score from Danny Elfman. Stellar effects of all kinds. A visual feast thanks to the cinematography, scenery, and visual effects. Fabulous production design. Fast paced second half and the film never gets boring. Some frightening attack sequences. Plenty of gore for those who like it in their Horror films. Some neat nods to the original.Cons: The first half is often plodding. Nothing here you haven't seen before. Mostly forgettable. Predictable. There are definite signs of production problems, which results in some plot holes. Somethings like the romance feel underdeveloped and rushed.Final thoughts: For a movie that had as many troubles as this one did it turned out rather well. However it makes you wonder what could have been because this film definitely had the potential to be a modern Horror classic. Alas it's seriously flawed, but fortunately it has enough going for it to still be a better than average film. Still worth a look for monster movie buffs.My rating: 3.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many true things have already been written by my fellow commenters, so I will only state what I feel is most important about this movie: If you are looking for the usual genre horror movie with lots of gore, some mostly half- naked, screaming girl victims and the usual ten-little-indians-plot - do not bother. This film takes the classic, literary approach to the beauty/beast story. It focuses on the tragedy of the hero/monster who falls not by his own flawed character, but by a sad and irreversible twist of fate, and re-discovers his humanity in embracing death over a life without morale. You WILL enjoy beautiful scenery, costumes and cinematography, an exclusive cast (though the acting seems a bit over-the-top at times), a fistful of iconic references (Hamlet, Oedipus, even King Kong, - am I the only one thinking of Ang Lee's Hulk?! - not to forget Sir Anthony Hopkins' own classic performances in Coppola's Dracula, Hannibal, etc.) and two hours of intelligent, maybe at times a bit too dramatic entertainment well worth your admission fee.If there is one thing to criticize : Like so many more otherwise enjoyable movies, this one also does not manage to convey true romance where it should (the story demands it) - maybe ten minutes more and a few well-written lines of dialogue would have helped.But still: If you're asking yourself why you should watch this movie in the time of Anne Rice, the Twilight saga and a variety of TV series in the creature/vampire tradition, then it is like asking yourself why you should read the original Dracula by Bram Stoker, the Hunchback of Nôtre Dame, the Phantom of the Opera or any other variation of Beauty and the Beast: Because true classics never were about the action, the special effects, the good-looking star, the hype or the costumes, but about the drama, the deep human conflict, and the timeless truth somewhere between the lines.Of this tradition, Wolfman is a worthy descendant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new 'Wolfman' does a lot of things right, which I guess makes the dead spots and scenes that DON'T work that much more noticeable. But it definitely has its heart in the right place and there is much to enjoy here. There are echoes of Lon Chaney Jr. in Benicio del Toro's performance of the tormented Lawrence (never 'Larry' here) Talbot. I found Emily Blunt's portrayal a welcome feminine touch, nicely done, even sexy in a subtle way. And Anthony Hopkins probably won't get an Oscar nomination, but there's no denying he is a special actor, someone you just can't take your eyes off. The two most memorable scenes for me were, first, the scene in the gypsy camp where a werewolf runs loose. Fast-paced, chaotic and frightening. The other is the scene in the asylum, which really caught me off-guard. But there is, admittedly, much time that passes where nothing much happens. And this in a movie that is not overly long by today's standards. It's good that the director takes his time to build up an appropriately spooky atmosphere, but that time need not be boring. Hopkins' performance reminded me somewhat of his turn as Professor Von Helsing in 1992's 'Dracula,' and indeed sometimes 'The Wolfman' looks and sounds like that earlier (and much better) film. Still, 'The Wolfman' is a fun ride for the most part and surprisingly faithful to the 1941 classic on which it is largely based.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great and respectful remake of the original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see The Wolfman on a friend's birthday and to be quite frank I was looking forward to it.Now you have to bare in mind this is a remake of the original Wolf Man which came out in the 40's/50's, I know it was one or the other but can't quite remember exactly when it came out. I have seen the original and having now seen this movie I think not only it is better but it respects the original with quite a passion. Almost everything I remember about the original is included and what was changed I didn't actually mind.The original coming out the time it did was a lot shorter and this gave a lot of room to expand and this has been done rather well. Introducing more material that works pretty well with the existing plot. Characters are given a heap more background, even the beast's origins are explained well.Now if you're looking for an original plot I'm afraid that this movie does not provide (being a remake of an old school horror), however this doesn't spoil it (providing that you can get over this lone fact).Characters are slightly believable and the incentive is often there, unlike the new Star Wars movies. Some lines are slightly bad on delivery by the actors but if you listen to what they say it all makes sense even if it does seem a little cryptic.Seeing the English countryside (replicated or not) in this movie was an added bonus amongst all the CGI. All in all a howling good movie, a tad intelligent, full on the gore, occasional scares and a story that if you let it will suck you in.7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great werewolf movie to add to your collection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In summary if you're a fan of werewolf movies you'll like this. I am a big fan of the genre, with American Werewolf in London, Underworld, The Wolf Man (1941), The Curse of the Werewolf (Oliver Reed) and the Legend of the werewolf (David Rintoul) being my favorites.Firstly, the werewolf is a werewolf!!! He's not a dog, zombie or lunatic that hasn't shaved for 3 weeks. Not only is he a proper werewolf, but he is a kick ass one....immense speed, strength and agility, who switches between 2 paw and 4 paw running. Rick Baker has come up trumps again with the Special Effects, and the score (Danny Elfman) was thumping.Hopkins is great and has great one liners. Del Toro is OK....Blunt is fine as the lead actress but there's no chemistry between the two. The story is similar to the 1941 classic but has an ever so slightly different premise for why Del Toro has returned home and the ending is totally different (corny as hell but fun!)Overall this met my expectations, and I was expecting good things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The Wolfman' is a welcome return to Gothic horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In The Wolfman, loosely based on the 1941 horror classic of the same name, Benicio Del Toro plays Lawrence Talbot who reunites with his estranged father Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins) as he returns to his ancestral home in Victorian England to find out more about his brother's mysterious murder. With help from his brother's wife, Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt), Lawrence finds a link to a gypsy camp where he gets bitten by a wild beast, which in turn, turns him into a werewolf. Meanwhile, Abberline (Hugo Weaving) of Scotland Yard is investigating Lawrence.The film is a visual marvel. It is amazing the amount of work that has went into the period details and the Victorian sets to give a beautifully foggy, Gothic atmosphere. Director Joe Johnston (Jurassic Park 3) seemed to have made sure there was always something going on in the background, which could've gotten in the way of creating any real tension, but for the most part, made the film more immersive. To have this much attention to detail in a monster movie since Francis Coppola's Dracula is quite refreshing.Anthony Hopkins' acting and delivery of lines give the film an extra weight that makes it feel elegant. One can't help but feel he had a lot of fun playing the role of Lawrence's father, who is a little more complicated than he first appears. Benicio Del Toro as the lead was an interesting, but welcome choice. There's something about him that's a little off, who is not immediately likable or conventional, nor "dapper" in a British sense, but he is a man with a haunted past, and his character fits perfectly within this genre. As a werewolf, he's perfect. Emily Blunt is likable as the semi-love interest, although her role is not a substantial one as it could've been in the film. Hugo Weaving playing a detective from Scotland Yard probably wasn't a huge stretch for him, but he plays his role as only he could play.So, now, how was the wolf, you ask? I thought the makeup and CG effects of the werewolf looked really cool. I really liked the way it moved and it had a great amount of menace. The transformation scene is reminiscent of American Werewolf in London, but with some improved CG. I had already dug the whole look of the background, so just watching the wolf man effortlessly running across London rooftops is quite a site to behold. I must say I had missed that "classic" look of the werewolf past and it was refreshing to see it again. There's good amount of gore as expected, but fits well with the essence of the film.This film marks a welcome return to Gothic horror, and I must say I had a lot of fun watching The Wolfman. It has pretty much everything one can expect from the monster movie genre?action, gore, shocks, amazing sets, and cool effects. Andrew Kevin Walker's (Sleepy Hollow) script, while it has a small twist, doesn't make any bold or surprising choices, but stays faithful to the genre. After all, this is The Wolfman. The film doesn't go into any deep psychoanalysis or philosophy, but what it is is a fun, Gothic horror flick, helped by great sets and visual flair. I give The Wolfman *** ? out of **** stars.More of my reviews are updated on http://twitter.com/d_art</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wolfman has enough bite to get by.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were rumors of production problems with The Wolfman on the internet towards the end of last year. If there needed to be any evidence to substantiate these rumors, it can be seen in the films release date, with February and the other early months of the year being a general dumping ground for films that have gone wrong. When critics finally got a look at the finished product, it is probably unsurprising that they generally wrote it off as a failure of a film. Due to all these reasons, I was a definite skeptic going into The Wolfman. However, I was nicely surprised that I ended up having a pretty good time with the movie.The story concerns a man named Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) returning to his hometown of London after he finds out that his brother has just died. Lawrnce begins to investigating into what exactly happened to his brother and it isn't long before he comes into contact with a werewolf. Of course, much madness and mayhem follows.The casting for this film was great. Del Toro looks like a wolf before you even apply any makeup and is totally believable in the title role. Hopkins plays the father of Lawrence, and although some critics have accused him of taking this role as a cash in, I disagree. Hopkins most famous role is Hannibal Lecter, a horror villain, and a film like The Wolfman is always going to be able to use his creepiness effectively. Hugo Weaving is also good as a Scotland Yard inspector the tries to stop the beast from doing more damage.Being a period piece set in the 1890s, the film has a nice, appropriately dark, vintage look to it. In contrast to this, the man to werewolf effects are very much 21st century. This essentially means that they are very cgi in there appearance, but that't not necessarily a bad thing. I was certainly entertained and impressed when the full moon came out and the hair and fingernails began to grow.Was the transformation effect as good as An American Werewolf in London? I wouldn't say so. To be honest, The Wolfman is nowhere near as good as that film or The Howling, the two titles that I would say are the real werewolf classics (I haven't seen the original Wolf Man but I am curious to check it out).However, this does not mean that The Wolfman is a terrible movie. Once the action started it delivered the goods. In a time when we have a series like Twilight turning vampires into pathetic little wussies, its good to still have a werewolf movie that features multiple decapitations in a murderous rampage. After all, these mythical creatures are meant to be dangerous, aren't they?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>10% Universal Classic Monsters, 10% of An American Werewolf in London, and 80% Hammer Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wolfman reminds me of the sequels to the original Universal monster movies of the 30's and 40's. You like them. You watch them because you want more of your favorite monster characters. But you know that they're not completely up to par or as complex as their originals.Before I move forward, I want to give credit where credit is due. When I make reference to Hammer Films in this review, it's because Gary Murray from BigFanBoy.com pointed out to me after the screening the similarities between this remake and those classic British films. I just didn't want to "steal" anything away from what he ends up writing.As far as the setting of the film, it is most definitely a period piece. This hearkens back to the Hammer films more than the Universal ones, which had modern day settings. It also has a very heavy Gothic overtone. From foggy countrysides to the dark and dank hallways of the Talbot homestead. This really does a great job of capturing atmosphere.Storywise, it's really nothing new. It's at times comfortably familiar and at others a little thin. It feels like maybe something's missing throughout. Through the entire climax of the film, I couldn't help but keep thinking of the Jack Nicholson movie, Wolf.Effects-wise, this is a big treat for horror fans. The transformation scenes and wolf makeup are very realistic and convincing, thanks to the legendary Rick Baker working his FX magic. The CGI city and background scenery is very well put together and looks beautiful. Furthermore bringing on the Hammer comparisons, keeping the blood and gore in this film were definitely one of director Joe Johnston's main priorities. There are Technicolor red splashes of blood everywhere. Body parts fly in the air and flop on the ground almost nonstop during any scenes of action with the werewolf. Stomachs are slashed, intestines spilling out all over the ground. Heads are lopped off. This is the real deal! Another thing I found very interesting was Danny Elfman's soundtrack. He really reared it in with this one. There's no signature kooky Beetlejuice or Edward Scissorhands vibe here. This is pretty much Elfman paying homage to the classic horror films and soundtracks of the past.The actors all do relatively well in their parts. Benecio Del Toro plays Lawrence Talbot as a brooding and pained individual. Anthony Hopkins plays Talbot's father with a delicious and vindictive air that shows how much fun he must have had playing the part. Hugo Weaving is commanding in his role of the Scotland Yard agent assigned to find out who's committing the vicious murders in the countryside. Emily Blunt does a great job playing the heartbroken fiancé of Talbot's brother, who becomes sympathetic and emotionally drawn to the helplessly cursed Lawrence.Overall, what you've got with The Wolfman is an interesting mix of 10% Universal Classic Monsters, 10% of An American Werewolf in London, and 80% Hammer Horror Film. I find it strange that Universal somehow ended up mimicking and taking so many elements from the Hammer films, seeing that back in the day they would have or did keep the British studio from using any of their monster designs or images. It's ironic how the tables have turned ? the influenced became the influencers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wolfman ? Howling tribute to the classic original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone expecting something totally different to previous werewolf films should not go to see this film. However, those expecting a painstaking reverence to the 1941 original will be pleased. This remake stays extremely true to its source material from character names to the look of the Wolfman himself. Rick Baker has said in countless interviews that Jack Pierce's make-up effects in the original film are what inspired him to enter into the field. Here, he keeps much of the original look of the Wolfman, adding subtle, slightly more realistic updates to the overall design.Those simply expecting to be entertained will appreciate the fact that the film pretty much follows the original with its simple beginning-middle-end narrative approach that epitomised classic Hollywood. There is no heavy interweaving of overcomplicated subplots that characterise many modern films. In essence, the film is like the original with its narrative functioning somewhat like a Greek tragedy. Our hero is doomed by his destiny to fall to his demise due to the family curse. In this case the curse being lycanthropy.Set in 1891, Lawrence Talbot (Benicio del Torro) is an American Shakespearean actor who returns to his family estate in Blackmoor after the horrific death of his brother Ben at the hands of some wild animal. His father, Sir John Talbot (Sir Anthony Hopkins), appears cold and distant but tells Lawrence that he is glad he has returned. After identifying his brother's dismembered body Lawrence gives his brother's personal effects to Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt), Ben's fiancée. Lawrence is haunted by the death of his mother and has dreams concerning her death.The local villagers are superstitious and believe a monster is responsible for Ben Talbot's death, and that local gypsies may be involved.Lawrence investigates the scene of his brother's murder and stumbles upon a hunting party at the gypsy camp. A wolf attacks the camp and in the ensuing mayhem leaves behind mutilated corpses. Lawrence chases the monster and is savagely bitten during an encounter with the beast before he is rescued. This sets in motion a chain of events that uncovers the cause of his brother's death and the dark, tragic Talbot family secret.The cast is solid with performances that seamlessly flow and feed off each other. You can see the interaction between them depicting raw and realistic emotions. Benicio del Torro blends the right mixture of charm and desperate sadness to Lawrence. Sir Anthony Hopkins was an inspired choice as he once again gives us another memorable steely, malevolent villain in Sir John. Hugo weaving shows us how he is one of best character actors in the business as inspector Fredrick Aberline. The beautiful Emily Blunt rounds out the cast well with her performance as Gwen. She continues show that she is a talent to watch out for in the coming years.Danny Elfman's robust score and Shelley Johnson's melancholic cinematography suitably adds weight to the gloomy atmosphere.My only issue with The Wolfman is the CGI sequences that shows the werewolf move with a grace and speed that makes the creature appear light as a feather instead of being a weighty, powerful beast. Still, the match of Rick Baker's make-up effects and the CGI sequences still make it better than werewolf incarnations in Underworld and Van Helsing.Overall, The Wolfman deserves to be credited alongside Dog Soldiers as the best werewolf films since An American Werewolf in London.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An honest-to-goodness, well-made frightfest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oscar winner for Best Visual Effects (Raiders of the Lost Ark), director Joe Johnston (Hidalgo, Jumanji) collaborates with writers Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self to bring "The Wolfman" to the big screen.After an overdose of vampire flicks as of late, bringing back the old world gore of the werewolf is a definite change of pace. Far from the frequent romanticizing of vampire stories, Johnston doesn't skimp on the gore. He doesn't go overboard with the special effects, too, as he delivers the horror and frights that come with exploring the monster.What Johnston brings to the screen is a Hallmark-worthy tale of Lawrence Talbot, played by Oscar Best Supporting Actor winner Benicio Del Toro (Traffic), who was exiled to America as a child by his father Sir John, played by Oscar Best Actor winner Anthony Hopkins (Silence of the Lambs, Amistad). Lawrence returns to his native England upon the request of his brother's distraught fiancée Gwen Conliffe, played by Golden Globe winner Emily Blunt (Gideon's Daughter, The Devil Wears Prada). He embarks on his own quest to help find meaning in the gruesome murder of his brother Ben, but in his investigation, Lawrence is bitten and unwittingly turns into a werewolf.The trailer pretty much already tells the familiar tale, nothing new is really added to the lore behind the creature, and so what is curious is how such a film attracted three A-list stars. It was a good old Victorian chiller, so it didn't make any misleading promises. An honest-to-goodness, well-made frightfest, nothing more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>17 minutes missing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who have noted that the film seems "choppy" or that "You've missed something"...that is because the studio cut out 17 minutes from the film. So the version of WOLFMAN that we've seen on screen is NOT the film that the filmmakers had intended for us to see. I've heard that the footage may be reinstated for home video, so we'll just have to wait until then. As has been the case with other films (DAREDEVIL, LORD OF THE RINGS, etc.), the home video versions are usually superior to the aborted editions that studio suits foist on the public via theaters. While I did enjoy the film as is, I could tell that there was much more to the story than we were presented with (which also probably includes some of the gorier aspects that the ratings board seems compelled to "protect" us from.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do not wait to rent this movie. Go see it on the big screen. Even if you are not intrigued by the story, the love scenes and violence, you will love the atmosphere. The acting was great, the violence believe it or not was phenomenal, as was the story. Anthony Hopkins is not my favorite actor, but he played a terrific role in this film. There are so many bad movies out right now, spend the extra money on this film, rather than renting it. If you're over 30 you will appreciate a remake of a werewolf movie instead of a vampire or zombie for a change. If you liked 'Underworld' you will love 'Wolfman' because it concentrates on the wolves. I know the economy is bad right now, but my friends, do yourself a favor, spend the extra money and go see this film, you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, Stylistic, Violent and even a little Cheezy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wolfman brings back Universal's classic horror-icon back now more amped up that before. The A-list cast consisting of Benicio Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins and Hugo Weaving give a strong back bone to what is essentially a very entertaining movie.Stylistically the film achieves its own interesting atmosphere with the dark late 19th century look and the psychedelic mind effects. At times the more psychedelic moments do seem to cross the point of unintentional hilarity but the effort is still quite good.Looking from the view-point of horror films The Wolfman is very weak on suspense. The movie resorts to making the audience jump with sudden, loud audio-bursts and with the unexpected appearance of people, animals etc. This is a very cheap method and I felt it crossed to the point of preposterous from time to time. There is of course some blood and gore but due to its over-the-top nature serves more as a visceral fuel for the film's actions and not really as an element of horror.However, the werewolf effects have been achieved extremely well. The film balances nicely between actual physical human-performance and CGI use. Because the film clearly attempted to stick true to the classic image of the Wolfman, the werewolves with their hunched look may occasionally remind you of the 1970s Hulk-series, but at least they look decidedly different from most other werewolves that have been seen in recent films.Sadly, as I have not seen the original Wolfman films I can't really measure how well this remake did justice to them. The script is okay, meaning the talented cast of actors actually get to show off some *acting* ability and not just move their jaws to meaningless words like in so many other contemporary horror-films. The heavy CG use is something I'll probably never get used to and there was even some redundant usage of it in this film but generally I can see why the film-makers would want to make the film-making process a bit easier with it.The Wolfman is thankfully a thoroughly entertaining movie even though it has its few weak spots. It's not, in my view, a true horror-film by definition but more of a supernatural, romantic action-film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above Average Reimagination Is Still Incredibly Tragic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake of the vintage 1941 horror chiller "The Wolfman" is nothing like Universal Studios' earlier reboot of its "Mummy" franchise with Brendan Fraser. Humorless, heavy-handed, and often hard-to-follow, "The Wolfman" concerns characters doomed to die by the inevitable hand of fate. Whereas the new "Mummy" movies bristled with action and adventure, "The Wolfman" lacks large scale action. Despite an epic moment in London, the action here is claustrophobic, downbeat, depressing. None of the characters?even if they are sympathetic?are charismatic. The family history of the Talbots is a can of worms that yields nothing but tragedy. The ephemeral blood &amp; gore and the abrupt nature of the werewolf attacks provide welcome relief to the complicated plot that the characters have to keep us abreast of with occasional speeches about "wilderness of horrors" that the past constitutes. "Jurassic Park 3" director Joe Johnston and scenarists Andrew Kevin Walker of "Sleepy Hollow" and David Self of "Road to Perdition" have tampered enough with Curt Siodmak's original screenplay enough so that this remake qualifies as a reimagination. First, they have changed the time period. "The Wolfman" occurs in 1891 rather than the contemporary modern-day setting of the original. In the new "Wolfman," characters ride either horses or around in horse-drawn carriages, while they rode around in automobiles in the first film. Second, the relationship between the father and son has been drastically changed. The protagonist's father in the first "Wolfman" was kind, considerate and urbane, while the Anthony Hopkins' father figure in the remake emerges as obnoxious. Third, the romance between the protagonist and the heroine has also been revised. Indeed, the filmmakers do preserve some of Siodmak's ideas, but they eliminate any in-depth expository scenes that cover werewolf mythology. Anybody who knows nothing about werewolves may be lost if they don't pay attention to the dialogue.Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro of "The Hunted") receives a letter from the fiancée of his older brother, Ben (Simon Merrells of "Invisible Eyes"), that the latter has gone missing. Actually, Ben was scouring the woods around the Talbot estate when the Wolfman struck and mauled him. Talbot, a well-known stage tragedian who plays in Shakespeare plays, drops everything to visit Talbot estate. He assures Ben's fiancée, Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt of "Dan in Real Life") that he will get to the bottom of this tragedy. The day that he arrives at his father's estate, Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins of "Hannibal"), informs him that Ben's body has been found in a ditch torn to shreds. Eventually, Gwen and Lawrence become lovers. Unfortunately, the Wolfman strikes as Lawrence one evening, but he survives the attack. Indeed, an elderly gypsy woman, Maleva (Geraldine Chaplin of "The Hawaiians"), sews up Lawrence's wounds. The following day, Lawrence recovers with no ill effects. A Scotland Yard Detective, Abberline (Hugo Weaving of "The Matrix"), visits Talbot estate and wants a physician to examine Lawrence. When the Wolfman kills again, Abberline and his men take Lawrence into custody and send him back to Lambeth Asylum in London where he was housed for a time as a child following the death of his mother. The physicians submit Lawrence to a battery of tests that include drenching him in ice-cold bathes to rid him of the thoughts that he is a man-beast. In front of a symposium of doctors, Lawrence is presented as a man of horrible delusions who dreams that he is a Wolfman when he really is not. Imagine the surprise of the gathered assembly of doctors when Lawrence changes into the Wolfman and goes on a killing rampage. After Lawrence escapes from the doctors, he makes his way back to Talbot estate when he has a showdown with the first Wolfman that killed his brother. Unless you cannot put two and two together, the surprise revelation about the first Wolfman is not much of a surprise. The duel between these two Wolfmen is the highlight of the close-quarters combat.Mind you, the original "Wolfman" was not the classic that "Dracula," "Frankenstein," "The Mummy" or "Invisible Man" was. This R-rated remake doesn't defile the previous picture, but you have to wonder about the father and son relationship. Johnston and his scribes loaded down the already depressing storyline with more baggage. The Hopkins character is suspicious from the start, and he comes as close to being the villain as this movie has a villain. The explanation for the Talbot family curse is contrived. "The Wolfman" contains its share of shiver moments. When the werewolf strikes, the man-beast is sure, swift and lethal. Clocking in at 91 minutes, "The Wolfman" never bogs down, but sometimes you feel lost in certain scenes. The scene where Inspector Abberline blows a mirror to smithereens looks idiotic. The meeting between the father and a feral Indian boy is an embarrassment. "The Wolfman" suffers from a surfeit of story with contrivance all over the place. The original Larry Talbot suffered from none of the psychological problems that assail Lawrence Talbot. If you prefer blood and gore, "The Wolfman" is exactly what you will want to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great but enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this film with an open mind; not expecting a duplicate of the original 1941 version and not expecting something completely original. Horror films as of late seem to just be yet another gore-fest like the endless Saw series or teen-slasher flicks...its good to see a classic horror get a remake and, honestly, done pretty well By now, I think we are all familiar with the premise of The Wolfman whether we have seen the 1941 film or not, so the fact that del Torro would eventually become the wolfman is no surprise.The atmosphere of the film is fantastic. The woods are creepy, the old manor house in its state of disrepair and abandonment is just as creepy, and Victorian London is done quite well. Atmosphere in horror films is so important and it was great in this movie.There were several genuine jump moments in the film, including times when you know something is going to happen but still are startled just the same.The plot didn't drag and kept moving at a good pace.Some of the acting was a bit one-dimensional including Del Torro's and Hopkins. Del Torro is just sort of brooding throughout the film and only shows emotion once when he is in the asylum. Anthony Hopkins almost seemed bored in this role and didn't seem to make much of an effort. Emily Blunt and Hugo Weaving did a pretty decent job.As for the violence...I know some have commented that the classic horror monster movies just implied the attacks rather than show them but that was more due to censors and budget than writing. I thought the violence and gore was done just about right here. Just enough to make you cringe but the plot didn't hang on it.Overall, this film was enjoyable and worth seeing. It had been a while since I saw a good horror movie and this fit the bill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm ashamed to say I haven't seen the original Wolfman movie (sad face) and probably shouldn't be writing a review. But as a lover of movies, and werewolves, I couldn't resist talking/writing about it. As far as fictional creature movies go, The Wolfman movie was simple and good. Dark, bloody, and hairy. Just what you want in a werewolf movie. The storyline as stated was simple, but strong enough for the length of the movie. The Characters, were as good as can be. Believable, but not overdone. I stopped expecting Oscar performances in these types of films long ago. They are meant for entertainment. Period.The setting of the movie was beautiful. In a sick, dark, lover of black, white, and red sort of way. It made the movie for me. I understand what people were saying about the pace of the movie being a little iffy, but then again with such a simple story line, one can only do so much. So, my only vice for this movie is that just a tad bit more of drama would have made it much better. All in all, a decent flick for those wanting to escape reality for a few hours. Fun, Dirty, and a little bloody, sounds like a good night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moderately entertaining, but it could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I generally like the movies about werewolves, but I have never been a big fan of the original The Wolf Man (1941).I respect the great performance from Lon Chaney, Jr. as the victim of the lupine curse and I admire the fact that the film found a fresh angle for the classic subject of "tragic monster"; and besides of that, it has picturesque characters, the excellent actors Claude Rains and Bela Lugosi and a fantastic costume design.However, I found the story to be a bit redundant, with a good emotional conflict on its centre (the monster is afraid of killing, but it has to survive) diluted by an excessive slowness and melodramatic dialogs.Maybe understanding those negative elements (not to mention the reduced attention of contemporary spectators -including me-), co-screenwriters Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self decided to fill the story from the new version of The Wolfman with other classic elements from Gothic cinema, from a tenacious detective to the horrors from pre-Freudian psychiatry.That was a good idea, and the film ended up being moderately entertaining; however, I found it to be mediocre.Director Joe Johnston (ex-supervisor from Industrial Light and Magic) is accustomed to work with stories which require a good amount of special effects, but he has also shown good hand to work with unadorned drama in the excellent film October Sky.Unfortunately, The Wolfman falls short on both aspects.The performances from Benicio del Toro, Emily Blunt and Anthony Hopkins lack of passion and energy, so they feel cold.The only actor who seems to be interested in his character is Hugo Weaving.Besides, the movie has pre-fabricated scenes and trite dialogs which indicate us what the characters feel, but without enough emotional evidence in the screenplay to endorse it.I am a big fan of make-up artist Rick Baker since I saw his work in The Incredible Melting Man, and he also made extraordinary works in An American Werewolf in London, Videodrome and Gorillas in the Mist.His work is truly legendary, and I was intrigued by the potential of his collaboration with Johnston, who is a veteran in the revolution of the digital effects.However, the result was disappointing.On the one hand, I respect the fact that The Wolfman uses the special effects as a support of the story, exclusively focusing on the metamorphosis.But on the other hand, the visual work is mediocre and lacking of creativity.I suppose that Baker and Johnston wanted to make a tribute to the artist Jack Pierce; however, at this moment of 21st century, it is difficult for me to feeling amazed by the atavism of the hairy man, dressed with rags and howling to the Moon.It may not be fair to compare the objective of this film with the one from other movies, but after seeing many creative re-inventions of the werewolf in the last decades, it is difficult to feel amazed by the monster created by Baker and Johnston.In summary, I think I can give a slight recommendation to The Wolfman, because despite being mediocre, it is moderately entertaining and it is never boring.However, if you are looking for an excellent werewolf movie, I totally recommend you An American Werewolf in London, The Howling or Dog Soldiers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent enough remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wolfman is set in Victorian England during 1891 &amp; starts in London where Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt) meets famed actor of the day Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) to ask for help in finding her fiancé who happens to be his brother Ben Talbot (Simon Merrells). Lawrence travels back to his childhood town of Blackmoor &amp; his ancestral home where his father Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins) informs him that Ben was found murdered in a ditch, torn to pieces by some animal. Lawrence start to investigate his brother's murder, the only clue is a gold pendant that was given to Ben by some local gypsies. Lawrence speaks to them but the camp site is attacked by some vicious animal like creature that kills several people &amp; bites Lawrence on the shoulder. Lawrence's injury heals quickly &amp; he discovers that on the night of a full moon Werewolves prowl Blackmoor &amp; that he himself is now one as he is cursed to transform into a beast every full moon &amp; kill...Directed by Joe Johnston this was a lavish big budget remake of The Wolf Man (1941) which was a popular black and white horror film &amp; I think this remake keeps fairly close to original story even though I haven't seen the 1941 version in a few years, while not a brilliant film The Wolfman is by no means a bad one it's just that it's sort of stuck somewhere in the middle being neither particularly great nor particularly bad. Originally released theatrically &amp; then on DVD &amp; Blu-ray with an extended director's cut that runs some seventeen minutes longer it's this longer version I will be basing my review on (I have never seen the theatrical cut although my Blu-ray has both version). At nearly two hours The Wolfman takes a little while to get going but get past the slightly slow opening half &amp; there's enough to enjoy in The Wolfman to make it a worth a watch. The murder mystery surrounding Ben isn't focused upon that much &amp; becomes an afterthought as soon as Lawrence gets bit, also I didn't like the way Lawrence &amp; Gwen fell so deeply in love so quickly. I mean they only knew each other for a few weeks &amp; even then didn't seen particularly close until the end. The twist that Sir John is a Werewolf is a little obvious actually but at least the script tries to throw in a few surprises &amp; deviate a little from the 1941 original. Inspector Abberline was actually a real Scotland Yard detective who investigated the Jack the Ripper murders even though here his presence is fictional. While the script tries to be deep &amp; deals with love, loss &amp; conflict none of it makes that much of an impact &amp; I did sort of get to a point where I was just waiting for the next time the Wolfman showed up.The Victorian England production design is top notch, the whole look of the film is lavish &amp; little expense was spared. The CGI is admirably restrained with lots of good old fashion make-up effects, the look of the Wolfman is understandably based on the look of the Wolf Man from the 1941 original &amp; as such is a cross between a man &amp; a Wolf rather than your typical looking Werewolf. The Wolfman make-up took three hours to apply apparently &amp; an hour just to remove. There's some good gore although most of it is quick flashes, a head is ripped off, a torn in half body is seen, people are shot, people are slashed &amp; cut, someone is thrown onto spiked railings &amp; an arm gets ripped off. Having watched the director's cut on Blu-ray last night I thought the film was just too dark, almost every scene was just black shadow, sure the blacks are nice &amp; inky &amp; real but black is still just black even if it's high definition black. There seems to have been some tempering with the colour too, the film has a sepia toned look about it, again maybe in reference to the look of the black and white original.With a supposed budget of about $150,000,000 &amp; filmed in England this looks great, the production values are slick &amp; Victorian setting fits the subject matter, the superstition &amp; action wonderfully. Talbot Manor is in fact Chatsworth House in Derbyshire which isn't too far from me actually. The acting is alright but maybe not as good as it could have been considering the cast, Hopkins &amp; Del Toror are OK with Hugo Weaving putting in the best performance.The Wolfman is a good solid remake of a much loved classic (although I don't rate it that much), it does what is expected &amp; updates the effects &amp; lavishes all sorts of sumptuous production design on it. The basic story is the same &amp; the makers give it a modern lick of paint, a decent enough time waster but nothing I could call brilliant.</fullReview>

The lead role given to Mr Toro is completely miss-cast. What was that wig about? The script must have been written by a ten year old. Toro's limited acting skills could never not hold it up. To think this was made off the back of a classic. That is seventy years old. This film relied totally on gore and violence and nothing else. Dramatic pauses with eyes flickering about where the script had just sort of run out of things to say.

		<fullReview>Most two or three star reviews I write are in response to films that are stupendously bad-- not just poorly made, but also offensive to my artistic sensibilities on some level. That isn't the case with "The Wolfman," which is too dull to provoke so strong a negative response.The film suffers from a blanketing mediocrity that compounds itself with each passing scene, and I was strapped to think of a single compelling reason (outside of a half-baked feeling of critical duty) not to fall asleep. But though my eyelids grew heavy, I watched the film in its entirety and can now offer the sentiment that, while not stupendously bad, "The Wolfman" is a film that I can't think of a single good thing to say about.The opening scene serves as a telling microcosm for the greater disappointing experience. In it, a man with mutton chops and a lantern (Victorian England, duh) makes his way along a moonlit wooded path. The atmosphere is eerie only in an immediately familiar horror- shorthand sort of way. You've seen this scene before, or if not can probably imagine it, because it's the very stereotype of a werewolf attack. And worse, any incidental suspense that's built is thrown completely out the window when the creature strikes, felling the mustachioed man in a half-second blur. For the record, I'm not sure there's a less interesting visual in the vocabulary of film that could have been applied. It sets a clear precedent for the uninspired, thoughtlessly choreographed action in "Wolfman," which has every reason to be the only highlight of this Hollywood remake.Instead, the action is just as inept as the story, which shuttles its characters around as if on rails to service one unsurprising plot development after another, and even the incredible cast (Benicio Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Hugo Weaving) shuck lame performances under director Joe Johnston, whose principal problem is a lack of focus in the screenplay. First, Del Toro's character returns from America to investigate the mysterious murder of his brother (our friend with the mutton chops)--and really that's enough for a movie--but then he gets bitten and the focus shifts to his becoming a werewolf. And then the identity of the first werewolf is revealed, and the film becomes a three-way power struggle between the wolves and Weaving, who plays the Chief Inspector tasked with hunting them down. Toss in a completely unconvincing love story and the bottom line is that there's so much going on in "The Wolfman" that none of it feels important.In fact, so little of the film stands out that it's almost impossible not to let your eyes glaze over and embrace the coming drowsiness. The film exists apart from its audience, completely unengaging, joyless, and unworthy of anyone's time or attention. "The Wolfman" scores a two not because it does anything horribly, but because it does everything poorly. If just one or two elements had fallen into place, maybe the movie could have been salvaged as popcorn entertainment, but even on the peripheral you have Danny Elfman's melodramatic score and merely serviceable visual effects."The Wolfman" may not inspire the sort of venom that stupendously bad films do, but it's so achingly boring that you can't help but wish you felt anything at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lowly Hour of the Wolf</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the remake world, subtlety seldom wins out in the face of spectacle. While an anomaly in the world of dime-a-dozen updates that nobody really asked for (consider most of the output from Platinum Dunes), this trend is especially distressing when applied to characters that have stood the test of time (no greater offender than Stephen Sommers' kitchen-sink pastiche, "Van Helsing"). With "The Wolfman," we can now let yet another ruinous remake collect dust in the annals of history while the original shines ever more brightly.The year is 1891. Stage actor (and one-time asylum inmate) Larry Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) returns to the palatial estate of his birth upon hearing that his brother has been murdered. Greeting his arrival are his father (a Razzie-worthy Anthony Hopkins), and his brother's fiancé, Gwen (the luminous Emily Blunt). Plagued by doubt and the gossip of the nearby villagers, Larry sets off to a gypsy convoy in search of answers. His investigation is cut short, however, when a vaguely-seen wolf tears through the convoy and leaves him mortally wounded on the moor. After experiencing an inexplicably fast recovery from his injury, Larry quickly finds himself transforming into a savage beast when the moon is full.It is no secret that "The Wolfman" took a difficult path to the screen, with production woes stemming from the loss of initial director Mark Romanek ("One Hour Photo"). Taking the reins was Joe Johnston, whose resume (including "The Rocketeer" and "Jurassic Park III") didn't lead me to believe he could handle a production with hard-R leanings. As such, nearly every frame of the film feels like an uncomfortable, unbalanced melding of over-the-top gore, awkward humor, half-baked romance, and some of the most jaw-droppingly awful CGI I've ever seen (I seriously doubt its transparent fakeness is a playful nod toward the surreal touches of its 1941 ancestor). But not all the blame can be placed on Johnston, who entered the game late?Andrew Kevin Walker's ("Se7en") and David Self's screenplay (which reeks of behind-the-scenes committee meddling) crams in so many distracting tangents that the plot never fully coheres.The characters are mere chess pieces being manipulated, and clumsily, at that: the initial scenes with Talbot's brother are a clunky catalyst for Larry's return; the relationship between Larry and his father is heavy-handed and distracting (especially when the laughable final "twist" is revealed), leaving Gwen (who, as portrayed by the game Blunt, is the film's saving grace) stranded in a half-baked romantic subplot (something that was key to the original's success). Later on, a Van Helsing-esquire character played by Hugo Weaving is introduced, but hardly developed?and, like nearly everybody else, spends his screen time gnawing the scenery to a shameless degree.And worst of all? Not only are the werewolf transformations lackluster, but the final realization of the beast's look is astonishingly lame. Which sums up "The Wolfman" pretty well, actually.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underwhelming, unengaging and pedestrian</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all a disclaimer - I admit I have not seen the original Wolfman from the 40s. So if the point of this modern version was to stick to the original as much as possible even though the story, characters, pace etc. are so obviously ill-suited for the 21st century, then I guess the movie succeeds.Otherwise, it fails on all these accounts.Seriously, I cannot remember the last time I was so bored in the theater. What makes it painful is that Hopkins and Del Toro are two of my favorite actors, and probably the hook that got me to see the movie in the first place.From the very first scene you know how the movie will play out. There are no surprises, no big reveals, no unexpected twists; this movie simply goes through the motions and what's worse feels forced and stilted. The overall experience is like listening to a story told by someone who would really rather be doing something else. Every werewolf/Gothic horror movie cliché is present. The characters are wooden and unrelatable, the plot is unengaging, the pacing is all over the place, the scary scenes aren't scary, the romance is laughable. Hopkins, Del Toro and the rest of the cast are so obviously phoning it in; you can't single out a bad performance, but it's obvious none of the actors were particularly motivated to pull out their acting chops and give their best.However, the sad thing is that the movie is still very much outside of the "so bad it's good" category. There are no obvious flaws or plot holes you might point your finger at and laugh, and it is really hard to eloquently express why it feels so unsatisfying. After seeing it I didn't feel angry or cheated, it simply failed to engage me in any kind of palpable way. It's simply a mildly boring and instantly forgettable experience.Personally, I say skip it. You aren't really losing much, or anything for that matter. Even if you are a Hopkins/Del Toro fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Horror flicks and I was very impressed with the casting of this film, Benicio Del Toro and Anthony Hopkins are excellent actors so with this said I definitely was excited to watch this, however my excitement ended quickly when I watched the film.The acting was OK, Benicio did a good job as the Wolfman and he was a great pick for the role, but the entire film lacked intrigue, mystery, suspense and thrill. These are all characteristics of a good Horror and there was none of that here.I would save your money, in fact I fell asleep and dozed off a few times. Money and time I will never see again....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a waste of talent...and in that I include the incredibly talented director who manages to make both Emily Blunt and Sir Anthony Hopkins look bad in a period film-now THAT'S a talent!!! Nothing works except for Rick Baker's makeup, but even that falls flat due to the fact that the film has little dramatic tension. Only an action scene in a Gypsy camp along with Geraldine Page's amazing turn as the spiritual leader of the Gypsies rise above mediocre-and most of the film falls WELL below mediocrity. The dialogue was so hackneyed and predictable I frequently was able to finish the character's sentences. I swear, Teen Wolf has a better script and makes more sense. Serves me right for seeing a movie that got dumped into theatres in February.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hopkins struggles in dopey werewolf flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Universal has a policy that all its main actors should be clean shaven. Unfortunately for Universal, Sir Antony Hopkins, having a keen eye for nature and knowing that wolves have a lot of hair, refused to cut his beard for his part in The Wolfman. Unfortunately for Sir Anthony the resulting film was so bad it didn't make the slightest bit of difference.Wolfman is a typical b-movie; predictable plot, hammy acting, buckets of gore and a great looking female lead. What makes it slightly different from others in its genre is the size of the budget, allegedly around $85 million. What this means is that it has Sir Antony Hopkins, Benicio Del Toro and Emily Blunt in the lead roles as opposed to ex-porn stars, the blood is painstakingly added by a supercomputer instead of a bucket and it's set in the picturesque English countryside rather than a disused warehouse.The plot is fairly standard. Benicio Del Toro plays Lawrence Talbot, an actor who returns home to his family mansion after the death of his brother, where he meets Gwen Conliffe, his brother's widower played by Blunt, and his father Sir John Talbot played by Hopkins. Lawrence investigates the murder, is attacked by a werewolf, gets turned into a werewolf, gets tortured by doctors who try to cure him from what they think is insanity (it's probably Lupus), escapes, goes on a rampage and then solves the carefully signposted mystery. All very fresh and imaginative.There is no tension in Wolfman, few surprises and apart from a several graphic disembowelments, very little even to shock. At worst it verges on boring. Blunt and Del Toro are passable in their roles, but it is Hopkins who carries the film almost singlehandedly, although even he is not up to his usual standard.With a little more character development instead of a heavy reliance on extravagant sets, props and costumes Wolfman could have been a lot better. As it stands, the fight scenes are entertaining enough to stop it being a total disaster, and combined with Hopkins' presence the film regains some credibility, but not very much.www.theworstseats.co.uk</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 2nd best Werewolf movie ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well this one was long in the making, to'ing and fro'ing between directors &amp; writers then finally it gets made, then there are recalls for re-shoots then there is doubt over Danny Elfman completing the soundtrack. With all of that out of the way we eventually get The Wolfman in all of its glory.The plot is extremely easy to follow. Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) has returned to his family home to investigate the circumstances of his brothers brutal death. He meets up with his brothers wife, Gwen (Emily Blunt) who informed him by letter of his brothers disappearance, and his strange and elusive father Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins). There is talk of a strange beast which has roamed the moors, surrounding the area, for many years which may be responsible for the deaths which have occurred. Also there are travelling Gypsies who have a dancing bear which the townsfolk feel could also be responsible. Lawrence learns that his late brother had dealings with the Gypsies and goes to meet with them to see if he can find out what happened. It is here that he encounters the beast which passes the curse onto him. The kills are fantastic, there is gore, blood, decapitations....you name it, its got it!!! Benicio carries his character off in true style and honor, making the audience take pity on him even when the beast takes him over. Anthony Hopkins, as usual, is marvellous. Script lines which would sound terrible if delivered by any other actor are delivered with a mysterious authority from Hopkins. Emily Blunt is believable in her role and her acting is good and firm and Hugo Weaving as Inspector Aberline is a joy to watch.There are fantastic set pieces in this movie, the man to wolf transformations are awesome, there are frights galore here and the movie doesn't overdo the CGI which is pleasing as so many movies, like 2012, relied too much on the CGI and totally forgot that there was an intelligent audience watching. I especially loved the way the Werewolf went from two legs to all four, giving the creature its true animal instinct as opposed to keeping it to more human form. Watch out especially for the scene with the asylum Doctor who attempts to 'cure' Lawrence of his imaginative condition....its great. Also watch out for Art Malik who plays Sir Johns faithful servant Singh. Its nice to see Art back on the big screen as I think he is very underestimated.I give this movie 9 out of 10 for a few reasons.1). The main twist in the pot line is pretty much let out of the bag within the first 40 Min's and its easy to work out.2). I felt that Emily Blunts character could have been used a little more as at times it felt as if she was there as eye candy.3). There are times when the plot seems to jump from one scene to the next without real explanation. Although, as said earlier, the plot is easy to follow, it would have been nice for these chunks to have been left in to give the work, as a whole, more fluidity.Those 3 points out of the way, The Wolfman is a fantastically enjoyable movie, coming a very close second to the classic An American Werewolf In London.....never look back Lawrence, never look back.Definitely recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great but not an instant classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I left the movie theater after watching this movie, my feelings were rather mixed. It was definitely a good movie: the gloomy atmosphere, the terrific scenery, the superb acting and, surprisingly (not because of Rick Baker but because of the use of CGI) well-executed special effects. However, the movie is not an instant classic such as An American Werewolf in London.This movie is definitely making an attempt to stick to the feeling of the old, traditional monster movies, and as such, it succeeds brilliantly. As I mentioned, the gloomy atmosphere, the scenery, combined with the acting, the thrill, the suspense and yes, plenty of gore (but not too much) makes it into a successful horror movie. Even the werewolf itself, despite the fact that they remained loyal to the original Wolfman's design, was frightening and intimidating enough.On the other hand, with a movie so anticipated as this one, expected to set the standard as 'the' werewolf movie, it does not deliver the punch. Perhaps it's just down to too much expectations from the audience's point of view, but for some reason, I expected more.All in all, the movie is great but I couldn't get rid of the feeling of missing out on something?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Universal Monsters are Back!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always been a huge fan of the Universal Monsters, especially Lon Chaney Jr's "The Wolf Man". In a world where remakes are a joke, this movie is definitely worth of having the update! After seeing the new Wolfman yesterday, I am beyond satisfied. You are immediately thrown into this creepy European world, whether you want to be or not. By the time Lawrence Talbot transforms, it is beyond relentless! I've never seen a werewolf kick ass like this one does.The old Universal Monster films were known for their epic, grand sets and groundbreaking special fx. This update takes those elements and turn up the heat. The sets, the makeup, the costuming, music, sound fx, gorgeous cinematography...all done so perfectly. I'm so happy that they kept true to the original look of the Wolf Man. They took that original look and made it into the most horrifying (and cool) werewolf I've seen on the screen to date.The sounds of this film are insane. You literally feel like this beast is around you at all time. Universal Studios set the standard for creepy mood and atmosphere in horror movies...even to a stereotypical degree. They take this stereotype and turn it into an all too real (and all too creepy) world of our own.I cannot wait to see it again in theaters and I cannot wait for the DVD. I'm dying to see the behind-the-scenes for this.I cannot stress more to you fellow monster movie lovers that this is a must see film. There was obviously a lot of love put into this movie and it shows. Let's support the Universal Monsters and keep their legacy alive.</fullReview>

The film is filled with academy award nominated actors but all their big names do is make the poster look fancy.Emily Blunt's character brings nothing new to the film.Her Character was placed in the story to build some of the pointless romance the film had.Mr.Hopkins speaks in quotes throughout the film.The Ending battle isn't epic.It's silly.If your into brainless horror, then watch it, but I'd advise anyone thinking of watching this movie to stay home and save their money.2 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

I would recommend it only if you are planning on stealing it off the Internet for free. To spend money on this beast of a movie would be immoral. This movie is what happens when you simply run out of things to spend 150 million dollars on. It looks and feels like something shot over a period of 10 years. It's got nothing to say except, "hey, look at me. I'm a lousy remake of a genre that should have died out the minute I was born." Maybe Hopkins is drinking again? That's the only way I can explain his accepting a role in a movie so bad. Run for your life!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore the naysayers - The Wolfman is a welcome return to the horror movies of yesteryear.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite what the naysayers are whining on about, "The Wolfman" is a great flick, especially for those of us who have fond memories of the old school horror movies from Universal and Hammer studios eras.And I know, I know, even some of the fans of those studios are taking swipes at this film, forgetting that some of their same exact arguments were once used against the originals themselves from critics of their times.So let me be clear here - if you are expecting "The Wolfman" to be the "Gone With the Wind" of horror movies, or expect it to be the second coming in terms of the genre, you are in for a big disappointment. It's neither of those things... thank God.What it is however is a sleek, fun and sometimes scary horror film that for once is devoid of dead teenagers, guys in hockey masks, blaring rock soundtracks from bands that will be forgotten a week after the film opens and dumb humor (that usually destroys most modern horror movies).There's nothing too original here; guy gets bit by a werewolf, suffers the curse of the damned, is pursued by angry citizens, etc.It's wonderful to see a modern movie look this "old" too. The colors are muted in some scenes as to suggest black and white. Fun too is the welcome return of the werewolf staples like silver bullets, fog enshrouded woods, the full moon and of course, the howling.The movie, again despite what you are reading elsewhere from people who are obviously more into romantic comedies than horror flicks, isn't really that gory. Yes, there are some pretty intense attack scenes but you've seen worse on almost any television crime drama over the past decade. While I wouldn't take a 10 year old kid to see "The Wolfman" I wouldn't say that it really deserved the "R" rating.Del Toro is effectively brooding and is always believable as the cursed Larry Talbot. Hopkins is icy cool as his father who has his own issues to deal with.The film itself is beautiful. The cinematography, the surreal flashbacks, etc all play out within a plot that includes ample amounts of armchair psychology, amazing special effects (even the CGI - as much as I hate it - looked good) and atmosphere so thick that you can cut it with a knife (or werewolf claw).Overall - this is a fantastic and welcome return of the horrors of yesteryear. Leave your brain and your lofty expectations at the door and enjoy.= rev greg=</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Earnest old-fashion remake with (unavoidably) contemporary technology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting that scenes in this movie evoke right away images of Sherlock Holmes (not Robert Downey Jr, much as I like him, but Peter Cushing) country ? foggy, sinister moor terrains where Holmes and Watson hunt down the hideous, haunting Hound of Baskerville. This same Gothic landscape reflects also the filmmakers' earnest effort to stay faithful to the original 70-year-old classic. Indeed, Benicio Del Toro who has the titled lead, intimated: "Lon Cheney Jr is always going to be the Wolfman to me. It's about saying thank you to these movies in a way, and respecting and honouring them in a way".The plot line, quite uncomplicated, is not difficult to render to an effective narrative. Del Toro is a good casting choice, projecting Lawrence Talbot's torturing transition from a taciturn stage actor to an agonized wolfman. The movie starts with a pleading letter from his brutally murdered brother's fiancée (Emily Blunt) which brings him across the Atlantic back to desolate Blackmoor where he plunges into a fateful investigation. Undercurrents of tension at the re-encounter with his long estranged father (Anthony Hopkins) develops gradually into revelations of dark family secrets that have been continuously haunting him since his mother's horrible death 25 years ago. More violent murders bring to the scene a Scotland Yard inspector (Hugo Weaving) with the instinct and nose of a bloodhound. This basically completes the players except for the usual red herrings, such as the wandering a Gypsy band that is also Doyle's favourite (red herring) in his Sherlock Holmes stories, such as "The speckled band".When Talbot is bitten by the elusive wolfman in one of the mayhem scenes, the game is afoot (apology for the repeated references and confession for being a hard-core Holmes fan). There is very little unpredictability: if you don't know where things are going because you haven't seen the original, you would have guessed it anyway. And to guide you, there is always the axiom of superstars: if a movie has one, there will surely be something worthwhile for him to do (unless it's clearly a cameo appearance).The pleasure offered by this movie is therefore the recreation of the Gothic world of horror and identity crisis. With the actors, there is no problem. As mentioned, Oscar-proved Del Toro believably portrays the living hell that Lawrence Talbot is going through. Hopkins not only nails his character dead on, but also had a whale of a time doing it. "Fathers and sons have very complicated relationships?..This character is cold right through. I'm good at playing that and I have a hard streak", he is reported to have commented thus, probably with a twinkle of amusement in his eyes. Blunt approached her role with professional urgency even when there isn't much going for her. With the aura of Elrond and Mr. Smith, two of his signature icon roles, Weaving knows how to make his presence felt whenever he appears in a scene.The problem is not so much with the human characters, but their alter egos. I venture to suggest that 70 years ago, it would not have been very difficult to create on screen a wolfman that was really scary. But after all these years from Wookies to Logan/Wolverine, what is one to do? People scream from mirth rather than from horror at hairy monsters at large! But if the movie makers should not be overly faulted for not coming up with a version of wolfman that is visually terrifying, they do deserve some blame for relying a tad too much on the "sudden shock" scare tactics, especially big-bang noises, which some considered the laziest attempt to deliver a scare. As to blood and gore, it depends on where you stand. The movie makers have exhibited a passion for decapitation, and a general flare for severed limbs as well as mutilated torsos, both back and front. Connoisseurs should be reasonably satisfied while some others will undoubtedly consider it excessive. Both, however, must agree that they did it with a style that is a cut (no pun intended) above the run-of-the-mill horror B-movies.In the final analysis, even if the result spells dubious achievements, the movie makers deserve some credit for going that extra step in their attempt to recreate an authentic classic horror that stays apart from the usual fodder with which today's horror junkies are fed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Major Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joe Johnston's new version of the 1941 horror classic, The Wolfman, is a muddled, confusing mess of a film.Benicio Del Toro's character, Lawrence Talbot, returns from New York City to his family's home in England after hearing the news that his brother has been viciously murdered by some sort of animal. Upon arriving home he is bitten by a werewolf, falls in love with his dead brother's girlfriend, played by Emily Blunt, and works out some long standing daddy issues between him and his father, played by Anthony Hopkins.The big problem with this film is that so much has been edited out; its obvious throughout that there are scenes missing. The characters aren't given an opportunity to develop, nothing that happens to them, or between them, seems justified. The love between Del Toro's character and Blunt comes out of nowhere, as does the elder Talbot's hatred for his son.I haven't seen this much wasted talent in a film since The Lovely Bones. I hope that Joe Johnston does a much better job with his Captain America film due out next year.2 / 5 on the Awesome Meter</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Magnificent!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lovers of the great Classic Movie Monsters have finally been given what we have been waiting for, for many years: a top of the line, major motion picture remake of Universal Studio's iconic " The Wolfman". This film will disappoint none of of the original film's fans and is in itself, a wonderful companion piece to the original.I saw this film at a 12:01 a.m. premiere, three days before Valentine's Day. I was fortunate to see it in a beautiful theatre with a great screen and sound system. And what a Valentine it was and is to hard core fans of the Thrillers of the '30s and '40s.There are so many great things about this film, that its' difficult to decide which direction to approach it from.If I had to condense my overall experience seeing the film watching it among what appeared to be true devotees of this genre ( it was, after all, midnight on a week night), I would say the following: The film itself begins and ends, is book-ended, between gorgeous upward shots of the full moon. From the first shot of the moon to the final shot of the moon, I felt as if the film grabbed me,lifted me off the ground, ran with me for 102 minutes, then threw me to the ground that I might catch my breath long enough to read the credits. It is truly a classic film in itself. Absolutely thrilling and completely satisfying.First and foremost are the actors bringing the film to life. I honestly hadn't noticed Bernicio Del Torro before this film and wondered why he was cast as Lawrence Talbot in the first place. Well, I was quickly educated as to why. His portrayal of a character wounded by the past and determined to confront the terrifying realities which are now thrust upon him, is deeply moving and totally convincing. In some ways he reminded me more of Oliver Reed's character Leon in "The Curse Of The Werewolf"(1961)than Lon Chaney's in "The Wolfman"(1941). Del Torro's performance rings very authentic, real, and true. He creates an interpretation of the character Lawrence Talbot that makes one think that in another universe this all could have happened to a man.Anthony Hopkins never disappoints and his performance here as John Talbot, Lawrence's father,and in several instances acting almost as narrator of events past and present, gives the film a profound sense of continuity, literacy, and logic that could have been lost given the action and pacing at which the film proceeds.And in regard to that action, hold on to your hats! I came to this film expecting to be entertained,not bowled over. The Wolfman's attacks are done in such a fabulous way, one is pulled right into the scene, and left breathless. One reviewer I read put it something like this: ...given the familiarity that most film goers will have with much of the storyline of the source material, the thrills actually come in the viewer's expectation of "I wonder how they're gonna do this"? Believe me the film dos not disappoint when it does the anticipated and thrills when it does the "not so anticipated".The rest of the cast give exceptionally nuanced and engaging performances. Emily Blunt stands out as the fiancé of Lawrence's dead brother. In her Gwen, she creates a character who is strong, moral, and in many ways beautifully stoic.Hugo Weaving's turn as the Scotland Yard Inspector Abberline balances the film's cast with a presence that is at times menacing but also humorous. Unlike so many of the recent sadistic,cruel,and just plain boring gore fests that try and pass for thrillers these days, The Wolfman's cast of characters are easy for the audience to empathize with and actually come to care about. So many of the newer torture and chop'em up flicks, feature characters who are simply amoral, crude, and lacking in any human quality that an audience can relate to or care about. The cast here invites the audience to enter into a thrilling battle of love verses the powers of darkness in a very entertaining and exciting way.Director Joe Johnston has created along with with the incredibly talented Cinematographer Shelly Johnson an exquisitely beautiful looking fantasy film. Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self have written a screen play that pays due respect and homage to the original 1941 film, while creating both a literate and fascinating take on the original source material of writer Curt Siodmak who actually created much of Hollywood's WolfMan mythology.Rick Baker's WolfMan makeup wisely creates a "Wolf Man" and not simply a scary looking wolf, which I felt was the case in the 1981 film "American Werewolf In London". He expands upon Jack Pierce's original WolfMan makeup, and the results are terrifying. He deserves an Oscar.Danny Elfman's score is both thrilling and beautiful, (I downloaded the soundtrack from ITUNES and love it).To movie goers who truly "get" the metaphors and symbolism that are at work in any of classic monster story-lines, this film will not disappoint.My hats off to Benicio Del Torro and Joe Johnston for creating such a wonderful homage and thrilling film experience to what is one of the greatest "Beast in all of us" metaphors ever written for the screen: THE WOLFMAN. A must see!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-done 21st Century remake of the 1941 Universal horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a very well-done remake of Universal's 1941 "The Wolf Man" (one of their last "classic" horror films with all the famous monsters we now know and love). Although yes, parts of the storyline were different from the original 1941 Lon Chaney Jr. version, I was still quite glad to see how much detail and care the 2010 Benicio Del Toro version gave to recreating (as if in direct tribute to) the overall "feel" of the original, particularly in the visual/atmospheric sense.The gore, shock, and special effects of today were there, but none were overdone and all were well within the context of the story. These shots were usually shown quickly and/or in shadowy darkness, yet still you saw enough to realize what actually was happening or had happened.Now some of the negative reviews here seem to be from people who may not be too familiar with films from the past to put "The Wolfman" in proper perspective; the "bad" acting or "understated" acting is one complaint in particular. On the contrary, the "understated" acting was not "bad" and actually served a strong purpose: to show the contrast between the calm and the following storm. Just like in "Silence of the Lambs", it was that eerie calmness of Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter that made him even more terrifying when we finally get a glimpse into the depths of his true savage nature.As a fan of older movies, the current films I do enjoy are those that can use (not OVER-use) special effects and such that appeal to today's jaded, de-sensitized audiences, but yet stay respectfully true to the classics of old Hollywood where it all began. Perhaps I'm simply not as cynical and "cool" as are those who grew up with the gorefest-slasher, blowup-everything-in-sight, CGI-to-the-max, and sexius-gratuitous movies that have so dominated the box office today (albiet not always succe$$fully) ...and I'm proud of it. :) So my thanks and my hat's off to director Joe Johnston and the entire cast and crew ...I even liked Hugo Weaving without a mask! lol</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You only need a woman to get rid of a wolf!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cast was interesting: Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt, Benicio del Toro, Geraldine Chaplin... and even the Indian guy in the movie was well know, that's why we got into this movie.But I just can't understand why all the movies about Lycanthrope shave to be this wild, bloody, and so easy to tell how it will end.The tale about the wolf-man is not really told in a traditional manner, and it is all based in trying to catch the attention in sudden surprises and special effects. Enjoyable though when Benicio del Toro turns into a wolf-man in front of all doctors.lesson: if you have got a monster in your backyard, hire a woman to get rid of it, 1001 men could not do the work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-see for horror fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that I had anticipated for what felt like forever. The film had been bumped from a potential release date at least three or four times and this last bump from November 2009 to it's release in February of 2010 felt longer than any of the other bumps. Not only that, but the film had a lot of problems in post-production. Announcements of two weeks of reshoots, a change in directors, the soundtrack being changed and then reverted back, a massive overhaul in The Wolfman's transformation, nearly twenty minutes of footage being removed, and several versions of the film being edited at the same time made the film seem like it was going to be a disaster. The film that was released in theaters wound up being one that is a must for any horror fan.Out of all the classic Universal monster films, The Wolfman was my least favorite. Frankenstein, Dracula, and even The Invisible Man all seemed to be in a league of their own while The Wolfman didn't seem to fit in the same demographic that those films did. Once this film went into production, the cast was announced, and pictures leaked from the set, I was extremely excited. This remake had everything going for it to be everything the original film was and then some. So that's the mindset I had going into the film and luckily it didn't disappoint. The homages to the original film are definitely there, especially during Lawrence's first transformation sequence and attack on the men hunting him. Not only that, but the film is practically overflowing with blood and gore. With films relating to vampires or werewolves, they need to be scary and intimidating. We need to know what these monsters are capable of. The carnage and bloodshed is glorious in this film. In fact, as a horror fan, it gave me chills. The film's setting in 1891 or thereabouts helped establish the mood and look of the film and was certainly used to its advantage since it's hard to imagine the film having as much of an impact in a different setting. But above all else, this movie should be seen in the theater for the sound. Hearing this type of film in surround sound is one of the reasons I keep going back to theater. There was a scene with water dripping that sounded like it was dripping right behind me and hearing that howl shake the floor and vibrate your seat is a joy. If you plan on seeing this movie, see it in a theater you know has spectacular sound. It is well worth it.There isn't much regarding flaws for the film. As a massive horror fan, this film really delivered in all aspects. During the trailers, it seemed like everyone involved was just reading off of cue cards or something. While watching the film, the performances seem to build. The two actors that stood out the most were the two main ones; Benicio Del Toro and Anthony Hopkins. Watching the film in context, the way they talk is uncomfortable since they haven't seen each other for so long and their reactions and interactions get more intense as the film advances. Del Toro's performance shines during his return visit to the asylum he was at as a child and Anthony Hopkins is truly magnificent in the second half. I found it odd that Hopkins was saying everything twice in the trailers for the film ("Terrible things, Lawrence. You've done terrible things," "Be strong, son. Be strong," etc). and he does do that quite a bit throughout the film, but his character gets a lot more interesting later on. It didn't bother me in the long run. Regarding the look of The Wolfman, nothing really presents itself that there were any changes regarding its design. He looks incredible and the mix of practical make-up effects and CGI result in one of the better werewolf designs in recent years. There are a few scenes during the transformation sequences that are noticeably CGI, but they're few and far between and are pulled off in excellent fashion for the most part.The Wolfman is easily the most satisfying horror film I've had the pleasure of seeing in quite some time. It is a must-see for horror fans as it's one of the few remakes that is better than the original film. The transformation scenes are spectacular, the carnage that's left is devastating and pure bliss to watch for fans of bloody violence, and the film's sound is truly what makes it worth seeing in theaters since it's done so well. The Wolfman comes highly recommended and is one of the best films to come out in the first few months of 2010.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Those teddy bears look so cute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was afraid for the 1st few action scenes I was like wow this thing is a mad killer so fast and crazy. but the continuity did not continue. the wolf got slower and slower as the film went on. His powers became more man like until the end of the film remind me of the clash between those two gorillas in planet of the apes. I don't know but these were the cutest werewolf i ever did see. I didn't know if to run or hug them.As for the script, well that should have never been written. It was unbelievable and the father-son thing carried no real currency. It had zero character development and seemed to not know what it was trying 2 say about the relationship. Some of the DP work looked good, it didn't look 2 dark 2 me. but when the film was finished it is not the kind of movie you would care enough about to make 2 many remarks. Basically by the end of the film you just didn't care what happened, I started to think about if the restaurants would be close and if I could still get a burger. That is how focused I was on the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was really looking forward to this but a dull opening hour left me empty by the time the better ending came along. And the monsters really reminded me of Oddbod from Carry On Screaming.Even Anthony Hopkins looked bored in his scenes and even the appearance of Hugo Weaving as the Scotland Yard detective couldn't save this film.There was no character development and it seemed that the makers were more interested in making the film look scary and Gothic than actually being scary and Gothic. It does look good but at the detrement of the script.Once the action moves to Lambeth Asylum things do pick up but not enough for me to recommend anyone to see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing to howl about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my fondest memories of my youth is watching the old Universal monster movies in the dark with the wind howling and things going bump in the night, and I so wanted to like this remake. But I have to say I came out disappointed. I'd have welcomed more tension, atmosphere, something lurking in the shadows and a bit less of the crazed frantic "superman speed" in your face rushing about and ripping off/out of body parts to satisfy the gore lovers - though I guess in a modern horror/creature feature that's now expected.I also thought the script was a little predictable in places - you know those moments when you guess what they're going to say and you're right? And OK so it's meant to be a horror movie in a pretty serious vein but the only humour in it to me was one scene with Hugo Weaving and - unfortunately - the shots of the hairy one running on all fours. Plus no real surprise! The one "revelation" in the film was no real revelation but just - again - predictable. I took a (correct) guess at it before I went in.In its defence it did production-wise look very good - the scenery/ settings were great. The transformation scenes were decent, but to me still inferior in effectiveness to the non-CGI work of American Werewolf and The Howling - from 28 years back!.One of the elements of the original which to me made it stand out was that I felt for Lawrence Talbot - an ostensibly good man tortured by the knowledge of the evil he would inevitably do when the beast took over him. Horror, but imbued with tragedy. Unfortunately the leading man here elicited no such feelings from myself, nor did the doomed romance angle really bite for me. Basically I wasn't pulled in; I wasn't gripped. I didn't care.So all in all watchable but a missed opportunity I felt to deliver some effective old school roaming beastie horror with chills and a little pathos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good solid remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been waiting for this movie to come out after having read about it for the last three or four years. I'm also a huge fan of the original, and all old monster movies. I'm happy to report they didn't screw up the movie. First off, I'll cover the good points. They didn't use a lot of CGI, and the make-up effects were great. Sound effects were awesome. All the actors did a great job, as you'd expect. It felt enough like a classic while being updated, too, and I thought it was a good balance. As far as the gore and violence went, it was treated just right. Some of the scenes were implied violence, for instance, you didn't actually see the person get killed, but maybe you saw them get dragged offscreen or maybe you saw blood spraying. In that respect it kind of had a more classic feel to it. But, there were some scenes where the violence was very direct and graphic, which I think you also need to illustrate just how savage and deadly a werewolf is. I didn't feel it was gratuitous, though, although some may disagree. Now, as far as the negative points, I'm not really sure I can say these things are negative. For instance, the color palette that was used was a little washed out and bland at times. In a way it helps create the atmosphere, but in a way it doesn't maybe pull you in as much as a fuller palette might have. Not sure. Also some people might disagree with the liberties taken in the story. I thought they did some interesting things with the story, talking more about the mom and brother, which were never really dealt with in the original. But it really worked here, and I'm not faulting them for putting their own spin on it. Overall this was a good solid remake of a classic. They didn't do anything to completely screw it up, and there weren't any glaring problems or complaints here. There are little things that maybe could've been improved on, but in the end, I say thumbs up for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wolfman: howl all you want, horror never looked so good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was totally satisfied with The Wolfman. Right from the start, I never strayed. The look, the sound and the feel were nostalgic if not delicious. Rustic scenes outdoors and inside a beautiful mansion were simply some of the best eye candy for someone wanting a horror movie done with old fashion movie making flavor. Thanks to modern technology some of that eye and ear candy really stood out. Steel, loading gun barrels, fire even - they all sounded like I never noticed before. The sound of a stream was almost like hearing one for the first time.I loved it all!! Performances were incredible by most. Hopkin's performance was so loved and appreciated. From the start, it was obvious he would have an important role as Sir John Talbot, father of Lawrence(Del Toro). Every smile and twinkle in his eye spoke volumes from the depth of his devious heart. Benicio Del Toro did a great job as well. The innocent bystander who is forced into a hellish existence, obviously suffered before his destined transformation. Del Toro put his heart and soul into both the good and evil sides of his character.As for Weaving and Blunt, they deserve recognition. Weaving was fantastic as Abberline, seeking the one who wreaked so much bloody havoc. Emily Blunt beautifully portrayed the lovely woman who lost her love, killed by a beast(or was it a mad man?), and then suffered for the inhumanity of his family's curse.It's hard to understand how anyone might not like this movie. Costumes, scenery, acting, action, blood, love...it's all there. I say we get Joe Jackson to come back and direct Frankenstein and Dracula...and a new Tarzan. I think he has a great feel for how these movies need to be done.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THere were only 2 reasons I wanted to see this load of crap... the trailer first of all looks decent and exciting. THen the one line in the film during the trailer where that retard says, "I WILL KILL ALL OF YOU!". But by the time it reached that particular scene I had already done a line of coke and syringed myself with heroine just to stay awake. Thats all I had on me OK. And the anticipation to see that one scene was so great that i was disappointed, but still laughed. I actually walked out of the cinema soon after(first time ever by the way). Do yourself a favor and rather watch he's just not that into you or something, cos this is worse than the movie death proof by Tarantino. Oh and the main character by the way was found in a mental institution(apparently for depression), and throughout the movie that was more than evident. And something i really found interesting was the fact that Neo was not found by agent smith throughout the entire flick, it really aggravated me. Cos this movie was so bad, i thought some Neo fighting might make it more exciting, but instead that had to use some guy with a wolf mask thats supposedly transformed, meanwhile he just slipped on a mask. ANyway, this is the worst movie ever made and the only good thing about the actors is that the main chick might be good in bed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie isn't really meant to be a classic in any way shape or form, but it's meant to be fun and entertaining and I think it succeeds perfectly! The acting is top-notch, especially from Anthony Hopkins (as usual). The story focuses on killings happening around a local village. Now, apparently they have been happening for over 25 years. A little death here and there. When Anthony Hopkins's son is killed, Hopkins sets out to find whoever did this to his son! Meanwhile his other son arrives to assist as well! Great horror movie with a few unexpected moments. I guess you could say it is predictable, but LOADS of FUN! 8/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back to bite the horror fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If it's a bright full moon night, it must be werewolves. Nearly 70 years after Lon Chaney Jr. terrorized Welsh villagers -- and legions of moviegoers -- The Wolfman has been resurrected.Concentrating on creating a foreboding atmosphere of horror over the cheap thrills of creature-effects, director Johnston draws us into the powerful story of a man confronted with his animal instincts.Circa 1891, a Shakespearian thespian (Del Toro, fulfilling his dream of portraying the character originated by Chaney Jr.), returns to his family estate to probe his younger brother's murder. As bad turns to worse, the bite of a werewolf causes the 'prodigal son' to contract deadly lupine properties.The suspense ratchets up along with the abundant gore. The actor strives to get rid of his curse, only to end up battling the beast in a pyromaniac but unconvincing climax.Photographed in predominantly grey-green hues, the film also boasts a haunting background music score, besides Rick Baker's superb make-up design. On the downside, a subplot involving a romance with the deceased brother's fiancée (Emily Blunt) is perfunctory. Also, the flashbacks to the siblings' childhood are heavy-handed.As the tormented titular character, Benicio Del Toro is alternately solemn and scary.Anthony Hopkins as his estranged father and Hugo Weaving as a Scotland Yard inspector belt out fairly efficient performances.Old-timer Geraldine Chaplin fetches up in the welcome cameo of a gypsy fortune-teller. Addicts of the horror genre need to seek out this remake of The Wolfman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of the Unrated Version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I've heard a lot of people complaining that this looks a lot like Van Helsing in the trailers. Let me just say that, apart from some similarities in cinematography and sets, it's not like Van Helsing. Just about everybody has heard the story of THE WOLFMAN. A guy goes somewhere with which he's not familiar, gets bitten by a werewolf, turns into one after ignoring constant warnings. Now, after telling the plot like that, you may think I'll accuse this film of being unoriginal. Since it's a remake, I can't call it on this, but I am getting tired of seeing this same pattern in so many movies.Positives: I really like the direction of the movie. The director is very good at setting up mood. The cast and the acting quality is actually very good. A lot of people are saying that Del Toro was miscast. I can see where those people are coming from, but I didn't think he was that bad. The gore is great, but not too overbearing. It's not like you're watching Friday the 13th with a werewolf. There are also some good scares in it. I must also praise Rick Baker's work on the makeup effects. I can definitely say that this may be Oscar worthy. I would also like to thank Universal for not using a completely CG werewolf. And thank you for that very nice werewolf on werewolf fight.The Negatives: The movie's biggest flaw is the serious lack of likable characters. Emily Blunt, as hot as she may be, is crying in all but one scene and isn't given much to stretch her out. I supported Del Toro on th acting, but I just never really cared about his character. This could have been helped if the love subplot between Del Toro and Emily Blunt (HOT HOT!) didn't seem so flat. Never bought it. There is also a very unsatisfactory ending. My last complaint is a few jump scares. I hate jump scares, and there are some of them very quickly.Basically, this movie is certainly enjoyable. Therefore, I would like you to give this movie a shot. I really can't see too many people hating it.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title its self "The Wolfman" pretty much gave the game away that this film would lack any imagination. Its the sort of title you would expect a bunch of 10 year olds to come up with much like some of the script which was given to some of the finest actors around. But I also had a bad feeling when I learned Benicio Del Toro was playing the role of the Wolfman. However, I thought with a cast that included Anthony Hopkins, Hugo Weaving, Art Malik and Emily Blunt I thought surely the film-makers had thought this out. But no, I was wrong, and it was worse than I could have imagined. Del Toro is a fine actor in a particular role but not this. I'm sorry to type cast him, but he did not have the depth to carry this off and it was painfully obvious. But then again with such a poorly written script and storyline there wasn't any need for his character to have depth. But it should have been. His character should have been filled with anguish and mental torture, and you should have felt and empathised with this. There has been many Werewolf movies over the last sixty years and whilst this one was definitely in the classic mould it never the less was an extremely poor interpretation for today's modern cinema. I wasn't expecting a remake of 'An American Werewolf in London' which was a completely original take on the genre. I somehow thought it would be made in the style of "From Hell" starring Johnny Depp who played the complex Police Inspector trying to track down Jack The Ripper. Both films are set in the same Victorian period but only one had depth, emotion and an intense storyline (with a twist) and of course that was 'From Hell'. The wolfman had none of that. It was entirely predictable from start to finish. I twigged on within the first 10 minutes how it was all going to pan out.What this story should have been was a cat and mouse game between Hugo Weaving (The Police Inspector) Anthony Hopkins and Del Toro with a hint of Malik playing the inside guy who knew everything but was loyal to his master. Blunts romantic interest role was totally predictable and it didn't take her character long to forget about her dead husband who was the brother of lawrence Talbot (Del torro). How predictable and actually a bit of an insult that were supposed to believe she would would be ready so fast to fall in to the arms of her dead husbands brother. There was no conscience or guilt displayed, it was just par for the course that the film makers decided that romantic interest was needed. Perhaps so, but couldn't it have been with Weavings character sent to investigate the killings. At least then I could have semi believed it. But no, it was a run of the mill mediocre slasher movie with a massive budget behind it and some actors filling up the space and time. Don't get me wrong. Im not blaming the actors who all did good jobs considering the script and plot, but that was the whole problem. The script and the plot. None of the actors were allowed to shine.There really isn't much I can say. It will appeal to 12-16 year olds and people who haven't seen much movies in general. IF your expecting something with a twist, a modern retake even in the classic style then you will be disappointed.The only good thing about this film are the London Victorian scenes which were spectacularly shotBut amazingly despite the sets, scenery, and the camera work being top notch the wolfman himself just looked like a guy running around in cheap fancy dress costume. He looks exactly like that Chubbaka character from the original Star Wars movies. I think a man changing in to wolf would not look like a semi cuddly teddy bear.Despite the clear amount of excellent talent working on this film in front of and behind the Camera something went badly wrong. I strongly suspect the money people interfered in the project and didn't let the creatives get on with the job. Many a movie has been ruined due to background politics and I suspect this is what has happened here. As I read a little of the background it seems this films production has been on and off since 2007. I suspect they couldn't get a top notch director willing to work with such a script which probably changed time and time again and probably got a lot worse by the time they began making the film. There was no passion or heart in the making of this film. There was no sense of were making something really special here. I just absolutely felt that as I watched. Im certain that many are glad the whole thing is over and done with, just like me.</fullReview>

Much like a lot of the "remakes" we see today, they know the name sells tickets, but they have no reverence for the source material.They decide to take the whole dynamic and put in this whole thing where Dad is a werewolf and murdered mom, and put the kid in an asylum for the insane where he was tortured with a 19th century version of waterboarding.He later turns into a werewolf and after satisfactory revenge on his tormentors, is killed by his romantic interest... Ho-hum, who cares at this point.Special effects are not a substitute for story and character. Never will be.New rule. Any movie has to be produced as a stage play first, to see if anyone gives a poop without special effects. Then and only then do we give you the 50 million in toys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake of the 1941 classic is awful beyond words. Nothing made you really like the characters, or feel very sorry for their predicament. They should have gotten Sylvester Stalone for the part of Larry Talbot. He would have had more star quality than Benicio Del Toro, and his acting wouldn't have been as flat and unremarkable.The original movie had nice guy Larry Talbot, without a dark past, bitten by a werewolf, and cursed to become a beast when the moon was full. His father was a likable chap, and the villagers were not a lynch mob. It is a classic of the Universal horror series. It had an all star cast of the period; Claude Rains, Ralph Bellamy, Warren Williams, Bela Lugosi, Maria Ouspenskaya, Evelyn Ankers and Lon Chaney Jr.This remake has the title the Wolfman, the characters of the Talbots, (with the addition of a few extra Talbots for no apparent reason), a bad, long, drawn out story, and main characters who, when they are dead, you clap.A pox on this remake. May it die a quicker death than the audience does if they watch the whole film.</fullReview>

The storyline of the history regarding the wolfman was just plain stupid. I won't give it away, but trust me you will be back on the board agreeing after you watch this flick. The Wolfman himself was a sad display considering the technology we have today to produce such films as the Hobbit and Avatar. Don't expect any Oscars for this bad boy, as a matter a fact , don't expect anything from this movie. Wolfman, nope nope Teen Wolfman or Wolfman Jacked or maybe Wolfman 1982.

		<fullReview>First announced around 2004, and after several delays and set-backs, Universal's updated version of "The Wolfman," is introduced to the world. I will start right off by saying that I did enjoy this new version, but I can't really review it fairly without touching briefly on the original film, and why the American public so loved the original.The tragic hero presented in the original film is lovable and garners sympathy from the audience in that he is generally a likable guy in a bad situation not of his own making. Larry Talbot doesn't want the gift/curse laid upon him, and will do anything at his disposal to make it all just go away.The overall feeling of the original work is pure atmosphere; an otherworldly atmosphere, permeated overall with the arcane. The Wolfman legend is old, but the curse itself is much older; facts which do not fail to make themselves known, without intruding on the movie, the atmosphere, or the story. There is no long, preachy, tired monologue lecturing the audience on the history of Lycanthropy, leaving its viewers to apply their own knowledge of the subject matter. Those lacking said knowledge simply enjoy a greater aura of mystique, which does not detract from the work, itself.This brings us to the new film.This Larry Talbot wins our allegiance via a different means as his predecessor. While the first Larry is likable from the start, by virtue of his own personality, this Larry has been subjected to a heinous childhood, with more to follow. We feel for him, but I cannot say we love him.Fog machines. No expense was spared in the procurement of fog machines for this work. No crevice, no crook nor cranny was exempt from dry ice insertion for the sake of atmosphere. And while it did generate atmosphere, I cannot say it added much to the overall psychological affect of the film, as it was all too obvious a ploy. We knew there were fog machines. Lots and lots of fog machines.The original was charming. The remake is gritty. The original eluded to the bloodshed. The remake revels in it. The original lacked story but contained intense atmosphere. The remake had an awesome story, but the atmosphere was 2-dimensional.That being said, for some reason, I liked the remake at least as much as the original. Perhaps it was the improved story line, or maybe Del Toro's brooding presence, or possibly Anthony Hopkins' performance puffery he uses when he is not sure the dialog can carry itself. Either these elements combined to create a modern Universal masterpiece for the ages, or was a brilliant accident.Either way, I like it. It will find its way into my Blu Ray collection.It rates an 8.45/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was disappointed. The only redeeming factor of The Wolfman was the quality camera work. The story lacked substance. The characters lacked depth. There were no real emotional arcs. The love story was a mere whisper in the wind. At the final scene I thought, "Who cares?" The Wolfman had a chance and they blew it. A remake of the 1941 classic, this film was planted in fertile ground, but the filmmakers ignored it and left it to the elements. In the end, it was nothing but a slasher film with werewolves.I have longed for the remakes of the classic Universal monster movies. Now, I want them to stop at The Wolfman. There's no telling what garbage they'll turn Frankenstein, Dracula, The Mummy, The Invisible Man, and Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde into.What a drag.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Good As Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hmm, I have restarted writing this review three times as although I think I know how I feel about this version of an old classic; I'm just in two minds about the best way to describe it to an audience anticipating the mother of all scare-a-thons.Story-wise, The Wolfman doesn't really need much of an introduction, having appeared in one form or another every decade or so in our movie theatres, and the story is one of legend as much as Dracula or Frankenstein, so telling you a man that gets bitten, but not killed, by a werewolf will turn into one himself every full moon will not be news to anyone, but still, so the story goes here, again.Given that the basic story is already known by everybody that is likely to want to either see the film or read the review of it, it falls to the likes of yours truly to merely focus on everything else. Anticipation from a personal perspective was high. If you wrack your brains for a minute or two and try to think about who you would choose to play the part of a half man half beast, rip your throat out and roar at you character, could you really come up with better casting than Benicio Del Toro?Well, you'd guess not. So why wasn't The Wolfman therefore more of a classic than it turned out to be? It's not as simple as putting your finger on one element of the film and no-one is solely to blame for its lacklustre finishes. Pretty to look at? Sure. There is no doubt about the setting. The film's looks, if anything, outweigh everything else. The first thing that nagged at me was the level of paranoia. The darkness of the film's appearance is not backed up by any ominous oppression from the script or the cast of players. I was expecting a tragedy, a lesson in wrung-out soul-wrenching. In short, I expected to be moved, and I wasn't. Not really.Del Toro doesn't appear to be as moved by this as the audience would like. This is not a comment on his ability, but more his commitment to a role that needs to be dragged out of him. He just doesn't come across as one who has firstly suffered from events beyond his control and secondly, become tortured by his own actions.Anthony Hopkins does his best with his role of Sir John Talbot, but his script is embarrassing and predictable at times. The final main player is Emily Blunt who, as beautiful and talented as she undoubtedly is, also fails to move the audience, given her own set of tragic circumstances. The three main characters, as a whole fail to engage and convince us of their dreadful and legacy. You simply don't feel it coming through the screen at you.Of all the acting on show, the one bright star is Hugo Weaving as Abberline, who is not afforded the screen time his performance deserves. In all, a bit of a disappointment that never reaches its lofty expectations. The opportunity to re-tell this grand story appears to fall short in all departments, aside from the cinematography, which was the high point in a sea of unfortunate averageness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To much of a remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been many great horror movies throughout time. From the slashers to the classic Universal Monsters. It's unfortunate to see these movies have a crappy sequel or even worse a remake. Over time all of the classics are constantly being remade. Frankenstein, Dracula, Friday the 13th, Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and now the Wolfman. And now it is rumored there will be a Creature from the black Lagoon remake.Now while not all of these have been bad, most of them have. And quite frankly I don't see the point of a remake, why not leave the movie at it's great place in movie history instead of risking making a crappy movie.Going into The Wolfman I didn't know what to think, it had a nice cast and it looked pretty good from previews (then again what movie doesn't look good in previews). After the movie I was a bit disappointed. While it wasn't "bad" it could have been better. Now if this was this was it's own movie, not a remake it would have been great. But anytime you make a remake you're going to have to change things, in this case a little to much. The main storyline was the same but when they went into the whole part about the dad being the wolf, that was just unneeded. Now I think when this movie was made they wanted to get more teenagers interested in seeing it. The reason I say this is because there was a lot of gore for The Wolfman. I mean this may have been as gory as a Saw movie. They had guts spilling, claws through the chest, heads being ripped off, I mean I don't mind gore, but for a remake of the WolfMan, come on. Now like I said this movie wasn't bad, it had a lot of potential and was a pretty good movie all the way around. When you have a cast with Benicio Del Toro and Anthony Hopkins, you know the acting is going to be good. I also liked the look of the Wolfman. Overall I would give this a solid B- 0r **1/2 out of 4 stars. Or of course a 6/10. If your a fan of Universal Monsters or horror movies, it's worth seeing and adding to your collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Visuals and effects... poor execution of story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So like others have said this film was "bloody good fun" i guess i can agree if all you're in it for is for the gore and special effects which in this case were pretty top notch. But as i sat there watching i began to realize that this is one of those films that has the visuals but not much else and thus falls short of having some substance.First off i disagree with whoever says the acting was phenomenal and that Benicio carried the film... NO HE Didn't. In fact i do agree with the fact that there WAS good acting but sadly not in Benicio's part. Hopkins was splendid as was Weaving and even Blunt did a fine job but Del Toro just im sorry to say failed miserably...As if the main characters performance being a disappointment wasn't enough we have another major contributor to bad film and that is the extreme lack of continuity. Throughout the movie you just cant help but feel that many things are being kept from you. Not from a POV of a Wolfman fan but merely in terms of good rhythm and flow. From scene to scene for the most part there were huge leaps that ultimately makes the viewer feel cheated out of his money while being forced to watch and extremely rushed story that prepares you for something in this scene and the expected result never comes in the next.On the plus side Wolfman looked great, animation was nice and firm, concepts were good, lighting great, 3d great, cinematography on par with the exception of good rhythm and continuity (important).So go watch it if that's all you expect out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not better than the original, except for fine visuals!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never saw The original Wolfman film and decided to watch it a few hours before hitting the theater for this re-make. Comparing them is easy, they are very different, but I wouldn't call The Wolfman a remake of the great Universal film of the 40s which I really enjoyed.The story for the Wolfman 2010 takes different twists and turns. I won't repeat what it's about, you could read the synopsis for that; Instead, I'd like to talk about whether or not the film will be considered a classic like it's predecessor. In one word, NO! Not as good overall. Except of course, the modern factor, its advantage due to the technical advancement of film-making 70 years later. The film was visually stunning, and horror fans will feel creep-ed out a bit by the old epic sets, lighting, and beautiful but eerie cinematography. It was a shame it didn't get too scientific and psychological like the original did, it instead pleases with more gore, action and stunts which I liked despite it's campy vibes.The film started out good, but in the middle, it begins to lose steam. You did feel for Larry Talbot at times, but not like the Lon Chaney character. The original role was played better by Chaney since he made you believe he was suffering. If it wasn't for Del Toro's physical anguish he went through, I'm not sure Del Toro sold the sympathy for the most part. In fact, there was no sentimental value for any of the characters, except for the surprising performance by Emily Blunt, who actually took the role serious. All in all, the performances were flat, especially from the 2 time Oscar Winners, Del Toro, and Hopkins.But it is safe to say that the ending did not totally disappoint by any means, it was just very predictable. The ending wasn't anything worth remembering, but saved itself with cool narrative and strong direction by Johnston. And coupled with a very good Danny Elfman score, you have a solid film that is worth seeing on a snowy night when there is nothing else to watch. I can't wait for the DVD release, I'll buy it because it's worthy of adding to my Universal horror DVD collection and am also looking forward to the 15 somewhat minutes that was cut out of the theatrical release.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a howling success, but decent nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the four main classic Universal monster films of the 1930s and '40s ("Dracula," "Frankenstien," "The Mummy" and "The Wolf Man") which have spawned remakes - not sequels - the latest effort by director Joe Johnson ("Hildago," "October Sky," "Jurassic Park III") comes in a distant second behind "Bram Stoker's Dracula," in this scribbler's humble opinion."The Wolf Man" takes the basic plot from the 1941 horror thriller and updates things a bit with Benicio Del Toro in the Lon Chaney, Jr. role and Sir Anthony Hopkins replacing the great Claude Rains. It's not exactly a fair trade, but some modern touches in cinematography and camera work do not detract from the overall effort.Adding support is the appropriately disbelieving Hugo Weaving ("Lord of the Rings," "The Matrix" series) and Emily Blunt (fresh off her starring nod in "Young Victoria"), as well as a whole gaggleful of superstitious and grimy British town-folk wary of strangers and ripe with warnings about "staying off the moors." Lawrence Talbot (Del Toro) is a Shakespearian actor - with an American accent - who comes back to his estate after his brother, Ben (Simon Merrells) is ripped apart by some kind of wild beast. No one knows for sure what did it; some speculate it's a bear owned by a local gypsy camp, others fear a lunatic murderer is on the loose, still others think it was a werewolf. Well, considering the film's title, I'll let the reader figure out who is right.It doesn't take long, however, to deduce the culprit. The mutated beast attacks the camp (seemingly killing dozens of well-armed citizens) and takes a bite out of Lawrence. A young gypsy woman expresses what all of us realize, that bad things will happen and the victim would be better off dead. Somehow, though, she is overruled by the matriarchal Maleva (Geraldine Chaplin, "Chaplin," "The Age Of Innocence"), who binds his wounds and sends him home.Nursed back to health by Ben's fiancée, Gwen (Blunt), and his father (Hopkins), everything seems to be fine, except that anyone who has seen ANY werewolf movie made since 1941 KNOWS exactly what will take place and when - during the next full moon.Sure enough, within a month, Lawrence goes through the same horrible changes as all of those other lycanthropes before him. And thanks to Rick Baker (who also supervised the makeup in the terrific "An American Werewolf in London" and has a bit part in this picture) the transformation is seamless and terrifying. The results are the same, though - dozens of slaughtered Blackwood Moor and London residents who died trying to stop the creature or poor saps who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.Captured the day after (while his father tskes, "You've done terrible things, Lawrence, VERY terrible things ..."), he is put through the basic 19th century insane asylum tortures, but - again - during the next full moon escapes and wreaks more havoc upon the suddenly unsuspecting populace.Realizing a terrible secret about his dad, and not willing to subject Gwen to possible death and dismemberment, Lawrence plots to go back home and end things.It won't be that easy, however, and the concluding battle is almost silly in its ultra violence. I also could not help but wonder just what happened to the werewolf that bit Lawrence - since no one seemed to kill that particular manimal. I mean how MANY of these things are running around Great Britain, anyway?! Using the "Bram Stoker's Dracula" and "Sleepy Hollow" approach, the atmosphere of the film is dark and darker. Thanks to the creepy cinematography of Shelly Johnson ("Sky High," "Hildago," "The Last Castle") and the well-placed low violin score of Danny Elfman, the mood is set immediately and is as relevant as the movie's action or direction.Short running time may also be a plus for those suffering from such dragged-out motion pictures as "Valentine's Day" and "Avatar." As far as acting, don't look for Academy Award nominations to be collected here, but it does have its scary and gory moments. Not as good as the original, but a valiant effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A seriously miscast but good looking movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, i am not saying that the ENTIRE cast was a mess, and when i first saw the previews about two months back, i have to admit i was pretty enthusiastic about this film, being a strong supporter of the werewolf lore (at least over vampires).The film in itself was pretty well done, the suspense is well achieved (i spilled my popcorn over the guy sitting next to me at one point), the visuals are astounding, and the setting is very beautiful.This being said i just have no way of defending both Hopkins or Del Toro, i mean, they are possibly two of the actors i most admire and some of their previous roles are among my personal favorites (most notably Hopkins as Dr. Lecter), their performances in this movie notwithstanding i just couldn't help but laugh at some points in the film, which i am sure is not what the director intended. I have to comment mainly on these two because they are the focal point of the film and i was really disappointed by the both of them. On the other hand Weaving and the beautiful miss Blunt do a really good job and are a perfect fit for their parts, so really a battle of contrasts if you ask me.All in all a visually well accomplished movie, with some of the worst main casting i have seen.</fullReview>

Thank God I was not.The atmosphere was just right and the acting in it left nothing to be desired. The special effects were top notch and the building of suspense at the right moments was unblemished. There are a few good scares and enough gore for the average horror fan. The plot ties together nicely and the score is just icing on the cake.Overall I gave the movie an 8. Had I not expected to be disappointed I'm sure the rating would have been lower.

		<shortDescription>Style over substance, but what style!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake of the 1941 Universal classic (this time as one word) The Wolfman comes at us with a dark panache that wonderful to look at. High Victorian Gothic never looked better. It's all here, the huge manor house on the moors, a funeral procession to the crypt, London by night. From the beginning the art direction takes center stage, shadows and oil lamps, moonlit forests. I was hoping they'd include the classic poem ("Even a man who is pure of heart and says his prayers by night...") would be included, at this point it's almost a tradition. I wasn't disappointed.The script writers take a few liberties with the story as all horror fans know it, pushing the envelope a few notches further into family dysfunction. A sliver of a love story seems added as an afterthought. Rather than enhance the plot is strains it slightly, but it still holds up due to the great performances and direction. Bloody gore is the star here, and hooray for that. Luckily we did not get a tame wolf.All in all a fun ride. There are several action sequences that are thrilling, the film moves along at a nice pace, but first and foremost, it's a feast for the eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally, I would not have given the movie a 3, but I could not help but be offended by its utter ignorance about cultural differences. As I was watching the movie, I got to the part where the gypsies were tending Ben's wounds, and as the English subtitle appeared on the screen, I realized that the language the gypsies were speaking felt very familiar to me. And why would that be so? I do not know a single word in their Romani/Gypsy language. But then it hit me. I could understand what they were saying because it was my native tongue, the Romanian language.This movie has offended me a great deal, because of its tendency to associate gypsies with Romanian. As other fellow Romanian have reviewed before, Romania is not even the country with the biggest population of gypsies, yet they chose to make Romanian their so-called native tongue in the movie.Really a thumbs down for me, for this one. The movie would have been moderately enjoyable was it not for this 'minor' incident. I felt utterly discriminated by this 'mistake', be it willing or not, that the producers have made.My vote will be given based on the mistakes the movie has made. I would have given it a 5 otherwise. But seeing it really offends us Romanians, it gets a 3 from me.</fullReview>

Upon going home and meeting his father he hears tell of a mysterious creature and he believes it may have something to do with his brother's disappearance.As I watched The Woflman I sat in aw of how little I cared about any of the goings on. Every character is absolutely flat and acted as such. Every actor might as well be reading their lines off cue cards and Anthony Hopkins feels like he's about to fall asleep in every scene. The drama, if you can call it that, is drawn from every cliché' in the book and the sets are as dull and drab as the script is poorly written.Some where along the line the filmmaker's should have realized that character drama is not their forte' and focused on the action and setting it up. Instead, every overly bloody action scene comes out of nowhere and feels like it was stuck in just to satisfy a requirement: "oh yeah, this is a werewolf movie well let's just stick in a scene with a werewolf pointlessly killing some people that'll do the trick." Well, it doesn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a well cut trailer, an A-list cast and a MA15+ viewer rating, The Wolfman promised to be a gory insight into the dark world of the killer werewolf for those looking to steer well clear of the Twilight hype. A thin and often predictable story line starts with the return of Benicio del Toro to his hometown investigating the murder of his brother. His performance does little to capture the struggle between good and evil and little sympathy is felt for him as he slumps over and dies at the end of the movie. Emily Blunt's natural beauty fits the role of the persecuted maiden like a glove and is the film's only redeeming quality. Mr. Weaving still sounds like Agent Smith despite the 19th century English surrounds and Anthony Hopkins puts in a solid effort but is far from spectacular. I was waiting for the movie to get progressively better but sadly it never did. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsuccessful redo of the 1941 classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This takes place in 1891 England. A man is attacked and killed by a wolf in a small town. His brother Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) returns there for the funeral. His father John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins) is acting strange and he meets and falls in love with his son's fiancée (Emily Blunt). While searching for the wolf that killed his brother Lawrence is attacked and bitten. He recovers quickly but has been bitten by a werewolf and he changes during the next full moon.This production was plagued by problems. There were tons of re shoots and the release date was pushed back multiple times. It's easy to see why--this movie is really pretty bad. It's all shot in faded color (which seems to be a law with all recent horror movies). It usually helps the mood but here it just deadens everything. Del Toro (who can be good) is bad in his role. Stiff and wooden all the way through. Hopkins is even worse! He seems to not have a clue on how to play his role. Only Blunt is any good and she's stuck with the thankless good girl role. The script has been done many times before and the complications added are more silly than interesting. Plenty of money was poured into this project. The settings are nicely atmospheric with tons of fogs and creepy forests and the Talbot estate itself is huge and crumbling. But the faded color and overly familiar story really wear this down. This get a 4 for the werewolf attacks themselves. There are four of them. They're quick, VERY violent and VERY gory. The werewolf himself is very scary. Also the howl of this werewolf is among one of the scariest I've ever heard (helped by the Dolby Stereo in the theatre where you hear it all around you). But, altogether, it's dull and listless. Not worth the money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable, Lousy Story With 2001-Looking Special Effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to go see "The Wolfman" I had pretty low expectations. This movie was sure not to surpass them.In fact, one high expectation that I had for this movie was towards the special effects. I was not expecting much in the way of story, but I was certain that the effects would be quite good. The first thing that stuck out like a sore thumb was the bear at the gypsy commune. It looked really bad. It felt as though they were using techniques from a decade ago. Beyond the terrible looking bear, I thought the deer looked very bad and the werewolves did not look as good as they should have.I feel as though it is pretty tricky to make a movie about a werewolf. There is only so much you can do with a character that is only a monster one night a month. I believe that it is possible to make a successful wolfman movie, but the creators of this production did not think out the box enough. Instead, they went for a standard issue script that had little imagination throughout. Everything seemed to follow a formula and was very, very predictable.The dialogue throughout the first half of the movie did not mean anything for me. It felt more like space filler before they really took off with the action. The characters were mindlessly talking about curses and fate and God forsaking people, but none of it really felt like anything was actually being said. Bad, bad writing.The cast were all A listers, but all performances seemed uninspired. I felt like I have seen Anthony Hopkins in this very same role before.After walking out of the theater I really felt that I just wasted almost two hours.</fullReview>

This is a remake of a not so great movie, w/ a similar brooding performance by Del Toro. I must admit I am a horror fan and a monster fan! If you are coming to see a vicious updated version of the first film then this is for you. I had an absolute blast watching this film. The make up was fantastic and some what true to the original. Some of the acting and story was so,so. The ending was a bit over the top, but fun nonetheless. If I go to see a film called "The Wolfman" then I better see &amp; hear a Wolfman tearing up the scenery and every person that gets in it's path! That's what I got. I don't go to those Jurassic Park films for the great story line. I go to see Giant Dino's tearing Sh*#t up. This is the reason I still go to the theatre to watch films. If this kind-a film (B/Horror)is not your cup of tea then don't bother,and don't bother reviewing it either, but if you like monsters,mayhem and a bloody good time, and I do mean bloody, then this is your flick!

		<shortDescription>Too Many Elements Fail to Remake A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a connoisseur of werewolf movies; as a kid I watched all the old Universal Wolfman movies with Lon Chaney Jr. as the tormented Lawrence Talbot until they ran it down into things like Abbot and Costello Meets the Wolfman. In the late 70's early 80's there was a resurgence in were-wolf movies, The Howling, An American WereWolf In London, Wolfen among others so I was really looking forward to The Wolfman.The Wolfman has Benicio Del Toro playing Lawrence Talbot, the prodigal son of Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins), summoned back to the family's decaying estate in England after the murder of his brother. Investigating the murder, Lawrence meets and falls in love with his brother's fiancé Gwen (Emily Blunt) and runs afoul of a werewolf, surviving the attack but cursing him to become a werewolf every full moon.The Wolfman tries to mix too many elements, Gothic atmosphere, a little Freud, ghost children, a decaying estate, deep dark family secrets, Victorian asylums, Gypsies, curses, frightened townspeople, werewolf movie lore, and the ingredients don't mix quite right. The Wolfman also borrows from modern werewolf movie lore incorporating the febrile dreams used to greater effect in An American Werewolf in London. Lawrence is taken to a London asylum where the doctors "get Victorian" on Lawrence with their treatments. It's in the asylum that we see the first real transformation of Lawerence into the wolfman. He's wheeled into a filled operating theater for observation as the full moon rises, and Lawerence vows he'll kill them all. Unfortunately, the scene evokes more chuckles than terror or horror.Del Toro as Lawrence turns in a solid performance as Lawrence, but doesn't deliver the tortured soul that fears becoming The Wolfman. Benicio Del Toro is a much better actor than Lon Chaney Jr's heavy handed Lawerence Talbot was, but I think Chaney's Talbot was much better at conveying this element of the wolfman. The love affair between Lawerence and Gwen is hampered by there being very little chemistry between Del Toro and Emily Blunt, whose love must save Lawrence from the curse, we never quite believe or see how these two have fallen in love. I think this Wolfman may assume the viewer knows much of the mythology and provides only the outlines of the characters. Hugo Weaving plays Inspector Aberline, fresh off the Jack The Ripper case, who doesn't believe in curses and werewolves but suspects Lawrence of being the lunatic murderer he's searching for. Anthony Hopkins seems to chew the scenery (pardon the pun and the cliché) as Sir John, but it's a much different role than the Claude Rains' Sir John of the 1941 original. Hopkins seems to be taking the roundabout way of being the modern Karlov or Lugosi, he was in Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula, as well as that modern monster Hannibal Lecter.Rick Baker did the make-up on The Wolfman, and you can see Del Toro's face in The Wolfman make-up (maybe The Wolfman looks a little too pretty). Director Joe Johnston who was formerly a storyboard artist for George Lucas is great on atmosphere and mood and does better on the technical end than the performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I want to like this. Honest. On the surface, it has so much going for it. Such a cast. Gorgeous and realistically done Victorian setting. Excellent effects. The choice of a man in a suit, instead of all-CGI. It's not boring, and the pace is good. A plot twist that isn't bad. Heck, they even start out with the monster hidden, though he ends up being overexposed soon enough. I haven't watched the original, but I can frankly imagine it being better than this. The thematic is potentially intelligent, and I might verbally express a positive reaction to it, had the flick not gone out of its way to shove it down my throat, rendering me unable to speak. And if they get it, then why is there no real pay-off to it? It feels like the message was added to justify it, to try to raise it above what it still invariably winds up being; a creature feature, and sadly, not that memorable of one. This does not build atmosphere or mood; it seems like it's sort of going for it, and can't quite stick to it. Occasionally, it excessively stylizes the visuals. More often, this attempts to get you to jump through cheap scares, and while they might get an instant shock out of you, they won't leave a lasting impression, at least not a positive one. I couldn't claim that I was really uneasy, and certainly not terrified, during any part of this. It may also have to do with the lack of characters to care about. They simply have so little personality, and what there is, tends to be unappealing, if not necessarily obnoxious. It didn't have to be Weaving in his role(or Del Toro in his); he has so little to do. Hopkins is marvelous, no doubt about it, and he is probably the best thing in this. The plot is reasonable enough. There is plenty of strong, bloody violence and gore in this, and it is gratuitous to the point where it ceases to affect the viewer. This holds a lot of disturbing content, as well. I recommend this solely to those who need a fix of mangy, flea-ridden horror. You may not require silver-bullets... this is pretty inert. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this remake of the 1941 cult classic, a man named Lawrence Talbot returns to his ancestral home on the English moors after his brother goes missing. When he arrives he discovers that his brother's body has already been found, and it looks as if he was torn apart by a wild animal. Soon, Talbot is bitten by a giant wolf and before we know it, he himself transforms into a hulking beast when the moon is full and goes on a rampage. Also along for the ride are his creepy father, his dead brother's former fiancé, a Scotland Yard detective and some gypsies.The only things that make this absolute mess watchable are the cinematography and production design, which create a wonderfully foreboding atmosphere. We have fog shrouded forests, vine encrusted edifices, long dark hallways, cob-web covered walls, and tons of gore. What's missing here is a good script, decent pacing and some actual suspense. There's absolutely no reason to care about Lawrence Talbot, and the only scares in this are the cheap jump scares.Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost C' movie style remake of a classic horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a kid I used to stay up late on Saturday nights to watch the horror double bill on BBC2, for me it was the highlite of the week. Out of all the monsters, creatures, and villains that appeared throughout the short season of Universal and Hammer movies every Autumn, the wolfman or werewolf was always the one that grabbed my attention most. He was a pitiful creature, not an evil monster but a good man pure in heart cursed to become a frenzied beast, out to fulfill its bloodlust under each full moon. I felt so sorry for this character, he always got the sympathy vote from me!I didn't really know what to expect as this version is set in victorian times like "Curse of the Werewolf" with oliver Reed, although that movie was set in Spain this one was set in England unlike the original "Wolfman" with Lon Chaney which was set in darkest Wales. Why they decided to change the location baffles me as does the primary synopsis of the movie... "Upon his return to his ancestral homeland, an American man (Del Toro) is bitten, and subsequently cursed by, a werewolf"OK... this character is born and raised in England, has a traumatic experience, gets sent to live with his Aunt in America for a few years and eventually returns home. How does this make him an American? In the movie Del Torro does look a bit chubby, assuming this is a requirement of American citizenship I will leave it at that.The original film was a "classic B' movie" and this remake is simply just a "B' movie" with its status not being raised any higher alphabetically and losing any claim to the "classic" label on the way.From start to finish we are subjected to tense quiet moments throughout the movie at the end of which comes the obligatory shock noise or "bump in the night" aimed specifically to make you jump out of your seat, in fact they happen so frequently you expect them as soon as the volume drops, which defeats the object, however one of these moments did wake me up at one point!The special effects range from good to fair, except for the cheesy head on view of the wolfman as he runs towards his victims which looks like its been taken from some yet to be released video game of the movie.Anthony Hopkins is getting on in years now and really should consider buying that cottage in the country. Although he starts on a high his acting skills seem to deteriorate throughout the film, and range from BBC period drama, through soap opera, right down to supermarket commercial. No doubt they'll dust him down for a sequel in a couple of years time.Hugo Weaving was the better cast member who actually looked like he didn't mind being on set that day! he has quite a funny scene in the local pub when he orders a "pint of bitter please" I wont relay it here as you need to see it first hand to enjoy it.Benicio Del Torro was no doubt chosen for this movie as he resembles what can only be described as the "love child" of Lon Chaney and Oliver Reed! throughout the movie he does his best to appear sad eyed and begs the audience for sympathy, unfortunately he gets none! I couldn't have cared less what happened to this guy! the only thing pitiful about him was his portrayal of the central character. Im sure both Reed and Chaney were turning in their graves.A great disappointment all round and they could have done so much with this story.I have both Olly and Lon's movie's on DVD, and tonight I think I'll watch them back to back and reflect on the good old days of the classic horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was so promising. I've actually been looking forward to the remake of The Wolfman since I saw a teaser trailer in 2009. When I learned that it had been rated 15, I was a little disheartened, but still positive. After all, how can you go wrong with a werewolf?It turns out, quite a bit. Although The Wolfman has a great cast, it's the lesser known actress Emily Blunt that does the best job along with Hugo Weaving as secondary character Abberline. Aspects of Del Toro's acting are laughable in particular scenes but he does pull of the brooding and moody side of his character. Hopkins again plays the crazy guy, as he does so well in other films such as Hannibal.The film does have a good story to it, although at times it plods on slowly and you find yourself losing interest at times.The make-up and effects department must have been changed part-way through production. Some scenes feature a realistic looking wolf-man and others look cheap and tacky. It's not all bad though, the amount of blood and guts is surprising considering the 15 certificate. Amputations, decapitations and gut-removal is shown in graphic detail, albeit briefly, in the most exciting scene in the movie.Danny Elfman provides music here, and it's brilliant as usual. The score, however, doesn't go far enough to save this relatively dreary and slightly disappointing remake.http://ukmore.tk/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The moon is rising. Have a howling good time a legendary tale that's fueled by emotions, anger and past personal demons.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many horror films remakes are now the norm so it was only fitting that "The Wolfman" a classic universal horror tale be retold. And it doesn't disappoint as the stars act well and the story even though it has plenty of blood, gore, and fangs has some background to it that makes "The Wolfman" an interesting film to watch even though it will not be a classic like the Lon Chaney Jr. one from 1941. As with this beastly character it shows just how dealing with the past of emotions, tragedy, and anger can plague a person and that some curses just can't be broken.Set in 1800's England Benicio Del Toro(who hams it up as Wolfman)is Lawrence Talbot who returns home after receiving word that his brother has been brutally and mysteriously murdered. This message was received from his clawed brother's fiancée the innocent and beautiful Gwen(well done by Emily Blunt). Also to contend with is the father Sir John Talbot(the legendary Anthony Hopkins)Sir Talbot tells of tragic secrets and it proves that the old legendary curse was meant to follow Lawrence. So you guessed it Lawrence is bitten and along the way he deals with the pain and emotions of being different and being caught in a messy triangle with the town folk and family."The Wolfman" is entertaining fun and it has it's gore and blood yet still the story of love, tragedy, and conflict spices it up as you feel all the powerful elements common to classic legendary tales. The scenes were shot just perfect with the spooky and dark backdrops of fog and the rising of the moon. And the wolf transformation scenes were adequate even in today's world of CGI and 3-D. Overall pretty good updated take on the legendary classic it's a roar and a howling of a good time!, as at the same time the story keeps you interested.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What about this movie justified remaking a classic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wolfman (1:42, R) ? Fantasy: Supernatural, 2nd string, remakeWhatever its other faults (and there were many), at least The Lightning Thief didn't lack for a rich and varied story. Different things came at you rapidly. Not so with The Wolfman, whose story is simplicity itself: Lawrence Talbot gets bitten by a werewolf, becomes one himself, turns into a ravening beast whenever the Moon is full, and ? since he's basically a decent guy ? has to wrestle with his conscience while seeking resolution to his dilemma. Despite the flashiness of the transformation scenes and the bloody massacres, the depths of the plot are all internal and psychological, with the tortured soul of poor Talbot leading him to dark introspection and brooding.The main problem with this latest incarnation of the lycanthropic legend is that Benecio del Toro's Talbot starts out introspective and brooding ? positively dour ? and just gets gloomier as the film progresses. He; Anthony Hopkins as the elder Talbot, Sir John, a big- game hunter; and Emily Blunt as Gwen Conliffe, the bereaved fiancée of Lawrence's recently murdered brother Ben, share almost all the screen time among them, and a more morose and despondent lot would be hard to find. We're supposed to believe that romantic sparks arise between Gwen and Lawrence out of their mutual grief over Ben, but who would be attracted to someone who's such a downer to be around? Lawrence seems to care so little for living that it's hard for us to care either.Hugo Weaving adds some bluster as Inspector Francis Abberline of Scotland Yard, a hard- nosed cop looking to live down his reputation as the man who failed to nab Jack the Ripper almost a decade earlier. He starts out convinced that the murders at Blackmoor are the work of another human monster like Jack, but he ? and a roomful of London's finest minds in psychiatry ? find out otherwise when a gagged and harnessed Lawrence is exposed to the full Moon in an attempt to show him that his werewolf ideas are just delusions.Early in the film, Geraldine Chaplin as the old gypsy lady, Maleva, remarks "He can only be released by someone who loves him." And, in keeping with the legend, there seems to be some truth to this, as ordinary firearms have no effect on the wolfman. Sir John's faithful servant Singh realizes as much, as he prepares his armamentarium and Lawrence notices his special bullets: "Silver! I didn't know you hunted monsters." "Sometimes the monsters hunt you.", Singh replies portentously. So it appears that something other than love may also have an effect. But we can't let all that foreshadowing go to waste, now, can we?So this is mainly a paint-by-numbers rerun of the old familiar tale, except with special effects instead of Lon Chaney's amazing artistry. This version of the story features an interesting twist about 3/4 of the way thru, and that makes it a tad better than the norm for a remake. But the relentlessly downbeat miens of the lead characters drag it back down to average ? square in the middle of the "up to you" range.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but nothing to howl home about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nearly 70 years after the release of the milestone original, starring Lon Chaney Jr. and Sir Claude Rains, we're confronted with a brand new version of the legendary story of "The Wolf Man". As usual with the overload of horror remakes nowadays, I was quite skeptical towards this film and entered the cinema with limited expectations. There was some good hope, however, mainly thanks to some of the people that are involved in the production, like the multi-talented cast members (Benicio Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins and Hugo Weaving) and particularly the special effects wizard Rick Baker. He pretty much owns werewolf make-up art, as he was responsible for the groundbreaking transformation sequences in "An American Werewolf in London" and "The Howling". "The Wolfman" is inarguably a very entertaining popcorn blockbuster. The action and spectacle immediately breaks loose, there's never a dull moment to encounter and there's enough blood and gore to satisfy the most overdeveloped horror junkies. Travelling theater artist Lawrence Talbot returns his parental home in Darkmoor because he received a letter from his brother's fiancée claiming the brother is missing. By the time Lawrence arrives, his brother's barbarically mutilated corpse has been found already and the entire superstitious village is convinced there's a cursed beast prowling around the area. When he seeks the help of the gypsies one night, Lawrence Talbot survives an attack from the Moors' wolf creature and from then onwards he himself is cursed to transform into a bloodthirsty monster whenever the moon is full. But his wolf man curse also means the start of a series of dark family secret revelations ? As said already, you have to appreciate "The Wolfman" for being a crowd- pleasing blockbuster with a no-nonsense attitude. The film is fast- paced, with good character drawings and plentiful of gory action. The only real problem with this film is that it's not very memorable. The makers seemingly couldn't decide whether to bring homage to the era of Gothic horror (with its beautiful set pieces and images of London around the year 1890) or to focus on the melodramatic Talbot family situation. The film guarantees 100 minutes of genuine thrills and mildly shocking footage, but it's not a classic horror effort by any means. The acting performances are great. In spite of looking too much like a Latino guy, Benicio Del Toro is quite believable as an English nobleman. Emily Blunt is gorgeous, Anthony Hopkins is charismatic as always and Hugo Weaving is the coolest Detective Abberline so far. Gore fanatics have loads of scenes to list as their favorites, including impalement, decapitations and numerous torn open throats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not meant to be Scary... Just a Waste of Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a horror fan, or even if you are not, I'm not going to stop you from spending your money on the tickets, but I will warn you that there is an unexpected style to this movie. People have their reasons for watching "The Wolfman." First, it's a remake for one, and Anthony Hopkins (Sir John Tablot) plays a major role in the movie. Additionally, it is a classic story. Unfortunately, the film has bad timing because of the unexpected jumps from one scene to another. To its merit, it had its moments of great special effects, but some of them are not so new, as it has the same setting as Sherlock Holmes. If Holmes was around then, the Wolfman would have been a good case for him to solve. Now let's get to the plot...It's the 1890's and Lawrence Tablot(Benicio Del Toro) gets a letter from his brother's fiancé, Gwen Conliffe(Emily Blunt), saying that his brother, Bem Tablot(Simon Merrells) was unexplicably murdered. Lawrence seeks revenge on the murderer. The village people where Lawrence and Bem's father lives, think the murder was committed by gypsies but they are wrong. To know how this mystery ends, watch the movie or, for less money, read the book or watch the old movie. This movie is probably not worth your money. This movie is rated R for gory scenes. Alright, let's get this straight. As you know, scary movies have there moments of fright, and unexpected scare. But sadly, you can predict every single one coming your way during this movie.Yes it could have been better, but how?... By having the scenes rearranged to entertain with more action and drama. By this I mean why have slow moments in the movie and then have little scenes of action? Why not give the people what they came for? Yes it's gory, not really similar to Saw movies. The thing that makes it downward for me, is the story line. The movie narrates in the beginning, then lets lose control of the story. If you seen this movie, did you think the cloths were unfashioned and unstyled. The movie could have done better on this.Is it worth your money? No, Is it going to be number one in the box office? No. But it will give you the goose bumps.--A. Haynes--</fullReview>

There was no excitement in this film, no suspense, the werewolf itself was a man with over grown facial hair who had claws.There's no special effects, seemed to be made in a hurry, sat through 2 hours of torture and embarrassment, being cursed by my wife at the same time. Even this film had a free showing, i wouldn't attend. Even if i was paid to watch i would happily decline.Your better off watching Sherlock Holmes, far more exciting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joe Johnston's re-imagined take on the classic should be thrown to the wolves. Built around cheap, loud scares and a weak story, The Wolfman is sure to give you a headache or time for a nap. I went into this movie so excited but was let down within the first 15 minutes by boring dialogue, blah acting, and unbelievable characters. I am a huge horror fan and love when a movie gets my blood pumping. Who ever says that horror movies just don't scare them are definitely watching the wrong ones! Other than the occasional cheap, loud scare, The Wolfman left me begging for a scene of suspense or a genuine, scary feel. The gore was entertaining in some parts of this film, but fell victim to poor special effects and a terribly imagined, throwback style Wolfman. Less revealing angles or a shaky filming style would have saved the Wolfman from looking like an overrated actor in a gorilla suit. This all leads up to a very cheesy climax of not so special effects.When there was not a werewolf on screen it was hard to keep my eyes open. Between the confusing flashbacks and very unbelievable characters this movie left me asking "REALLY?". This film tries its hardest to develop a gloomy past for Benicio's character but misses by a mile. Hopkin's and Blunt's characters are quick to do exactly what you thought they would and will have you saying "I told you so" to your friend sitting next to you.I am thankful I had free tickets to an advanced screening of this film! If you're looking for anything remotely scary or entertaining, I recommend looking anywhere else. Thanks for reading and I hope this review helped.www.silverscreamreviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i cannot recall how long ago i saw the original wolfman, i cannot recall the ramifications the subsequent viewing had on my life, i cannot recall much except i know i was younger, probably much like all who have seen the original wolfman and did not warrant a rewatch before seeing the remake. all i really remember is the translation of fear from the unknown that made it's way from the screen as if the projector had become my eyes and my hair stood on end as i could feel a change within myself, cold air ensues. i was young, my mind forever changed, and this precursor of manhood stood in front of my like a transsiberian orchestra shifting from interlude to symphonies lost in time, in the nocturnal remains of youth. and this is the story that has been reconstructed. while waiting anxiously in the make shift opera theatre we sit in the dark, illuminated by side lit chandeliers flickering in the occasion of the moment. i tell myself there is no way a childhood horror will have nearly the same impact on a man thirty years older, a remake nonetheless. i sit anticipating the moment the lights are fully lit, the credits coming rolling down, and i can confidently say "i knew it was going to be that bad, there is no way they could remake this film." the chandeliers' flickering stops, the entire theater is black, the exit signs are even drawn into the black void of uncertainty casting whispers and panic throughout the air. the projector fires up, the speakers crackle, we are transported... to the past? a parallel universe? a place where horror can live? a place where are memories are revived in front us through the ears and the eyes. a monologue spreads from the right speakers to the left, another voice enters, another voice, an environment starts to shape, we can hear somebody walking, maybe this is a city? the screen slowly casts light in blurs as a picture is no being constructed from the black, one by one each sound is eliminated, the walking on cement changes to a rustling of something parting leaves and blades of grass. we hear a man screaming in shear agony, the picture of white blurs sharpen, it's anthony hopkins, now the film begins. without completely analyzing and glorifying the movie, simply i haven't had an experience like this with a movie probably since i watched the opening moments of scream some thirteen or fourteen years ago. the movie does well on maintaining it's own dignity and charm as is as well as invokes some of the nostalgia about for those who have seen the original. it's movies that are made in this fashion that demand the respect that is given to them, and adds a sense of the same original feelings that made the originals so great to begin with. and the fact that the premises for the opening was completely schemed out and aimed at restoring those feelings was truly icing on the cake. for those whom loved the original there is no doubt you will surely love this film as it does so much to capture and deliver those same feelings. also anthony hopkins and benicio del toro are two very gifted actors amongst most of the Hollywood unhopefuls. this is an eight and a half out of ten for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1891, the actor Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) is summoned by Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt), who is the fiancée of his brother, to return from London to the Talbot Hall in Blackmoor to help in the search for his missing brother. Lawrence meets his estranged father John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins) and has a cold reception. When a beast attacks a gypsy camping, Lawrence chases the creature and is bitten in the neck. Gwen treats him and they fall in love for each other. However, in the first full moon, Lawrence turns into a blood thirsty werewolf. The Scotland Yard Inspector Abberline (Hugo Weaving) comes to Blackmoor to investigate the murders while Lawrence discovers a dreadful family secret. "The Wolfman" is a remake of the classic dramatic story of 1941 that is supported by the magnificent performance of Lon Chaney Jr. and a tight and solid screenplay with 69 minutes running time. This remake is basically a collection of special effects, shallow and too long. My advice: prefer the classic. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "O Lobisomem" ("The Werewolf")</fullReview>

As a brief summary, there is not an original idea in it, the direction is plodding and confused, Benicio Del Toro is wooden and unbelievable, the dialogue is shocking, and Anthony Hopkins seems uninterested.They have tried to create a "back to basics" horror, and instead have made a boring little film which has little to offer. I find it baffling that a writing team with credits such as Se7en and Road to Perdition can have created something so poor.The only spark of life in this miserable film is Hugo Weaving, but with little to work with and a small part he can do little to raise the standard of the film.This is clichéd, badly thought out nonsense.

The sets looked great and Hopkins and Weaving were spot on but the male lead?what the hell was that all about and why didn't anyone take him to the side and ask him to take the marbles out of his mouth? Can't they at least do that after they shoot the movie? Go over it and fix the guy's speaking voice. Benicio Del Toro is built up to be this 'Actor' who is stage renowned for his Shakespearean works and that he was English born and of proper upbringing for at least ten years or so of his life. However, this guy shows up like he's from East L.A. born out of Mexican Heritage. I don't get why this guy is the lead. Before you say 'racist' or something stupid, my wife is Latina?and she was embarrassed and commented throughout the movie of why---if they are going to re-write the history of the Wolfman story---couldn't they have at least gotten a Latin guy who could pull it off and be believable.

		<fullReview>This movie achieves the dubious distinction of being both incredibly predictable and laughably nonsensical. It's as if it were constructed by committee-- better have some Tim Burton color-drained imagery for the twenty-something horror fans, some gore for the teens, and don't forget a treacly love story for the ladies. None of these aspects of the movie actually amounts to anything. Instead, the film just lumbers along with uninteresting characters engaging in improbable, unmotivated behavior.Why does the father seem to hate his son so much? Who cares? It creates "dramatic tension." At one point we learn that all the recent mayhem has resulted from a mistake. The "original" werewolf was restrained during every full moon for about thirty years, but something has gone wrong on this one night, so the creature attacks. Then, this same werewolf somehow escapes again on the very next full moon. What happened? Wouldn't the alive-and well werewolf keeper have been a little more careful on this next full moon? Again, who knows and who cares? It leads to a "dramatic situation." In short, this movie has a sloppy story and a shabby plot. It looks bad too-- all drab blues and murky grays, not just for certain scenes, but for EVERY scene, especially those featuring cheap CGI.If you want to see a good werewolf movie, rent the original Wolfman (1941). Or try one of the following: An American Werewolf in London (1981), Wolfen (1981), The Howling (1981), In the Company of Wolves (1984), The Brotherhood of the Wolf (2001), or Romasanta: Werewolf Hunter (2004).Skip this dumb movie, which wastes usually talented actors on a really, really, really bad script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable and shallow, not much of a story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The set, acting and all is adequate enough (not surprising considering the cast) but those alone don't make a decent movie.You couldn't care less for any of the characters if they live or die. A jump scare and then the beast with serious intentions causing loose body parts, wounds over and over again.That's not the way to make suspense, but to people to yawn or even fall asleep as one of my friend did.Not worth to pay and see in a theater but OK for rental if you're into werewolf movies, which are mostly (even) worse than this.I'll give it a fiver for acting and production + decent FX.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wolfman should fear the Reaper.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, my movie experience may have been slightly skewed, because the night before I saw Wolfman, I saw Avatar in Imax 3D, and that was a pretty sweet ride. That said, I had high expectations for this movie, especially when I looked it up on IMDb and it was rated 8/10 (at the time). So, no spoilers, here's what happened... We are greeted with pretty standard character introductions right off the bat, given who, where, what, when and why. At this point everything looks good because the sets really are well done and Ben is giving it his best. 1. The audience is then given bits of mystery to develop the story, and then the spooks start. This is this thing I have about exaggerated gags. Watch this film and tell me if the first half of it DOESN'T wear you out because you get sick of stuff jumping out at you. Scenes which have no purpose being suspenseful are still injected with spooks and gags that you never really get comfortably into the story of the film because you always have a mental guard up against the next silly gag. 2. The next noticeable let down of this film is the casting. I am a huge fan of Ben and Anthony for their past characters. As a matter of fact, their names on the bill is half of what drew me to see this movie. I realized though that a huge mistake had been made casting these two together. They don't make a believable father/son combo at all. This really isn't their fault either, the script bent them over (with camp) and then the director went in for seconds (not up to the task of working with these great actors). At a few points in the film, listen closely and you can hear Ben's accent slip. Now, I don't blame him for this at all, it was just someone else's mistake to cast him here, and it harms his characters believability. Anthony on the other hand, occasionally shined, or did what was expected of him as an actor, take your pick. In the end it was a forgettable performance, and as with Ben's case, I blame the director. In my opinion, the only person who really fleshed out their characters potential in the film was Hugo Weaving. He was able to pull out an interesting, multi-faceted character and I thank him for it. Also, the fellow who plays Singh did quite well. I won't mention the female lead because she's not worth mentioning. She irritated me frequently.3. At some point you'll notice, about halfway to 2/3rds through the film, that you may have missed something. Or something didn't make sense. Or this just seems to be getting a little zany for all the good ground work that was laid in the first 15 minutes. If you're any sort of a movie goer like me, you'll find yourself not caring. I don't feel remorse for ignoring a movie that will lure me in under pretenses of being an excellent film with top class actors and then treat me to a gag buffet with a story like a pair of jeans that's been through the washing machine too many times. It just doesn't look good anymore.4. The title roll of Wolfman left me unsatisfied. He is much scarier before you actually see him. After that, once you realize he only has one (1) expression, it doesn't matter what he's doing, who he kills or how he does it, he never shakes the "guy in a costume" stigma. Actually, the guy who wore the wampa suit in Empire did a much better job. 5. The climactic scene is uhh, like a 5th grader with ADD dreamed it. At best. Even as you're watching it you may get distracted by the cinematography, "why did they just show that image? It just seems out of place..." "What? That doesn't make sense." You get the idea. In conclusion, I on the whole was not satisfied, nor was my movie going companion. I paid $20 bucks to see this, that does in fact make me the biggest idiot in this review. The film isn't a total loss though, you can go expecting it to suck and maybe have a good time. See Avatar after Wolfman and they will both sit better with you, if you catch my meaning. Pros: Hugo Weaving and other supporting cast. Set design. A few interesting special effects. Cons: Poorly casted, Poorly written, Poorly directed. Gag infested. A few poorly conceived special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humm, i just don't know if these questions were asked before it was made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well Wolfman, when I saw the first trailer I thought to myself can a cast as strong as this do anything with a story that should have remained a work of literature? The answer I came up with then was "No, don't think it can" The story of the Wolfman, is my opinion is Eclipsed by the likes of Vampire, and Demons etc. (I am not punting Twilight) There is just so much more to be coaxed out of The Nosferatu or even demonic creatures, and the reasons are as follows. The other dark creatures beginnings are often unknown of difficult to track back to their roots, which makes the end of the breed obscure, and the ending a little more open ended. How do you kill something, when you don't know where the root is?This is were the Wolman fails, not enough time has ever been spent in the making of a Wolfman flick on the origin of the curse, the Wolman movie, is??.well a Wolfman movie, it leave nothing to the imagination and title tells you so. Man gets bitten by beast, well WHOOP DEE DOO how original. Having said that, the movie is not a complete loss, and this is why I am so frustrated, you have at your disposal the infinite talent of Hugo Weaving, the dark, mystique of Benicio del Torro. Emily Blunt And you make a movie that should have gone straight to DVD?? The sheer power of actors was insufficient to drag a weak plot out of it's inevitable tail spin. They were just too good for the movie.This might be a bit of blasphemy, but I dare say that Anthony Hopkins was incorrectly cast in the role of Mr Talbot. Someone of less stature would have done the role more justice, I mean this is Sir Anthony Hopkins he is a great man, and unfortunately it is difficult to separate the "HIM" from his roles. I mean he does the era justice, he does the castle justice, he does the woods justice, the mist. But to imagine him as a mindless beast?..does the movie an injustice, it is just not believable of him. (P.S I am a big Anthony Hopkins fan, but no)I will go so far as to say, that the movie is like a poor episode in a series, and let me tell you why, we have all seen " Van Helsing" Van Helsing was not based on the wolf man, but had a werewolf in it, that was arguably not the focal point of the movie, but managed the Werewolf a lot better than Wolman did. In Van Helsing, you feel for the Werewolf, the curse!, his link to his sister!, and you kind of hope the hairy beast comes right?.right?Well in the Wolfman, the Wolfman is a mindless beast you have no connection to him, you don't know what drives him? Is he eating or is he killing????So to answer the question i set off asking, was this good? No, it was OK. Could it have been done better, definitely yes.At the risk of everyone making an origins movie, let us cast our mind back, and see how many movies were successful at making a movie about a character's origin. Almost all of them barring Street fighter.Will somebody please do us a Wolfman origins</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat enjoyable, when not taken seriously...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many BAD things about The Wolfman. Performances range from dry to laughable, the music simply does NOT fit with the overall tone of the film, certain scenes come off as comedic rather than horrific (Without ruining anything; pretty much any of the beheading scenes)... Simply put, I just don't understand how one COULD take this movie seriously.On the flip side, some lines and sequences are actually quite enjoyable, due to the sort of B-movie feel. The gruesome evisceration of people stops being horrible and quickly becomes comical, when viewed with a sense of satire. In fact, some of the performances, specifically Anthony Hopkins' and Hugo Weaving's, one could get the vibe that they weren't really trying and were going more for a fun depiction of their characters, and less of complex ones.So, overall, when watched like a B-Movie, it's more fun. That is, more fun to make fun OF. My understanding was that it was going to be a dark, complex, visionary re-telling of a horror classic. And it could be that therein lies the problem...From what I understand, previews for the film give off more of a serious tone. People expecting that will be truly disappointed, perhaps even appalled. People willing to watch it for a fun, just-for-kicks gore-fest, may be more satisfied.Bottom-line: Don't expect a classic. Expect a popcorn horror flick, and MAYBE you'll like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness (and fog). OK, I admit it. I love this stuff. As a kid, I watched Frankenstein, Dracula and Wolfman movies again and again. The 1941 version with Lon Chaney Jr as the Wolfman is classic horror. Of course, the film itself wasn't really so scary ... instead, it's the possibility of the transition from man to monster and then back again! Director Joe Johnston (Hidalgo, The Rocketeer) stays true to the original story and shows us how far stunts, special effects and make-up have come in the last 69 years. Add in another terrific score from Danny Elfman and you get a few jumps in your movie seat.Benecio Del Toro and Anthony Hopkins are absolutely perfect casting for the cursed father and son. Their transformations work well given their "natural" features ... especially Del Toro, who looks as though he was born for the role.Emily Blunt is the token eye candy, and Hugo Weaving (The Matrix) is the Scotland Yard detective on the hunt. Neither are really given much to do, but it doesn't matter. The fun starts when the full moon arrives.The down side is that the CGI are a bit weak when the creature is on all fours running, jumping and leaping tall buildings. But that's a minor quibble when you consider the set design is breath-taking. Horse and carriage, cozy English pub in a quaint town, and a run down-once majestic castle that houses Mr. Hopkins and family.I applaud the director for remaining true to the roots of the story and not "updating" it ala Twilight to show high school students in 21st century NYC as werewolves. Go in with the right attitude and this one will make for a fun Valentine date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The incredible hulk with fur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a movie goer, I am a little embarrassed I supposed for having not seen the 1941 Wolfman. The closest I ever came was watching Lon Chaney parody himself with Abbot and Costello. Looking at Joe Johnston's remake from that perspective, I see a good deal of the Incredible Hulk in this formula. With his square head, and short cut, Benitio Del Toro even looks a little like the Hulk, but I've diverted excuse me. Despite a somewhat lifeless performance from Del Toro and a climactic act that feels a bit confused and rushed, The Wolfman succeeds in being a Gothic and entertaining weekend watch, sprinkled with gory bits and lots of little shocks.Del Toro is Lawrence Talbot, a Shakespearian actor touring in London, about to return home to New York, when he receives some rather disturbing news. His brother has just been brutally murdered by someone or something. At the request of Gwen, the brother's fiancée/widow, Lawrence returns to his home town of Blackmoor to investigate. The locals suspect gypsy mischief and possible something to do with one of their performing animals. One night while visiting a gypsy camp, Lawrence is bitten by something fast and furry. The rest of the plot is pretty obvious even if you haven't seen the original.Despite the blatant use of 21st century CGI, which isn't all that great (except for one 'almost' flawless rendering of Anthony Hopkin's decapitated head), The Wolfman feels much more like a throwback to the age of horror from thirty or forty years ago, a time when atmosphere soaked features like the Exorcist, the Omen and John Baddam's Dracula came out. Though one could argue that it has its moments, The Wolfman is not generally a scary feature, but it is a haunting one for sure though. I guess that is pretty much what Joe Johnston's film intends to be. The end result (despite being rather plot thin) is refreshing and will likely be satisfactory for a horror movie goer.</fullReview>

All i need is Hollywood to bring my emotional ,spiritual and intellectual level down to approximately 'idiot' level and the try to tell me what is a great film,a story that brings iconography,folk lore legends and overall entertainment and be so,so,so wrong.It pains me to give this tripe any recommendation at all.See any other 'wolfman' film that's beenaround for maybe 70 odd years. Incoherent,incohesive,silly at times...a lot. A waste of talent in the lead actors and the 'damsell in not much distress',whoever she was, could have been anyone and well,we couldn't have given a toss. Probably the most hyped but biggest disappointment of 2010.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie featuring some of the best actors like DelToro and Hopkins would have to be something different but here for The Wolfman its nothing new who have seen movies on 'werewolves' apart from visuals and sound effects. This is the story of a men who was called back by his brother's wife when his brother got disappears. So he(DelToro) goes back to his town to find his brother but when he reaches he found that his brother is already dead. When inquired, he found that his brother was killed by some kind of monster, a monster who appears under full moon. His father (Hopkins) suggests him to go back to London but he denies and tries to find out the truth.On his way to find the truth he got bitten by the monster (Werewolf) and he got cursed by werewolf. He finds that he has also become werewolf after bitten by werewolf. This way things goes and at the end he kills the werewolf because of whom he got that curse.While watching the movie I don't find the wolfman itself creepy or scary nor there was much bloodbath like other movies on werewolf. DelToro tries very hard to portray the wolfman but I don't find him up to the mark. Anthony Hopkins was Good as usual. The director has not created the The Wolfman much scary apart from a few sequences which were good enough to scare the audience. The story itself does not have strong hold.So apart from a sincere attempt by DelToro and good performance by Hokins movie turns out to be average.Watch if one has never seen movies on werewolves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>now that's CGI animation film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be very honest I was not very sure if they could match the class of the original 40s Wolfman again. Even though I watched the film a good three weeks after the release, by that time the rave reviews and ripple on the box office were sign enough to make anyone believe that they have done it again. But not me. I was of the opinion that this one would have a big hangover of the 40s Wolfman and people are liking what they liked in earlier version, and there would not be anything new to offer.BUT.... how wrong perceptions can be.This is a revelation of sorts. Its not even a single notch below the its predecessor. Its right up there.... on the top, among the finest films of the year...or if I may dare to say EVER. Just when we were actually forgetting The Wolfman, and he starting to become nothing more than a vague memory buried under sub par renditions of our furry foe, comes Dino El Toro Munnabhai, late of Bollywood fame... rejuvenating The Wolfman from nowhere. Franckly speaking, I was not a fan of The Wolfman, I am not very impressed with his doings... but this film surely changed the perception a lot if not completely.Revealing or commenting anything on the story or performance or any other technical aspect of the film would be stupidity, as its seen to be believed.You'll realize the beauty of the film when you won't realize when your eyes were filled with tears while laughing your hearts out. Now that's what you call a perfect animation film. The first aim of animation has to be humor and The Wolfman has that in plenty and mind you not only for kids. It will surely make the adults laugh as well. And the humor and fun is not only in animation but in dialogs as well, which makes the film all the more enjoyable. A good story coupled with state of the art 3D animation, apt voices and good direction make it a worth family outing. But fun and laughter is not the only thing this flick has to offer, it teaches a lesson or two without you ever realizing that you are being taught. that's the beauty of the film. It points a finger on changing horror styles, human flesh connsumed by the bucketful, cheating is always bad and more prominently the family values. All in all a real entertainer.The Wolfman (2010)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in the day, talking about the 1940's kind of day, we had a good release of the Universal horror monster collection, from Dracula to Frankenstein, from The Invisible Man to the Mummy and from the creature from the black lagoon to the Wolf Man, these movies were made to frighten people out of their wits. A lot of these movies have been remade and I have to admit that when I saw the trailer for The Wolf Man, I was excited. I loved the original Wolf Man, it's just a terrific and very suspenseful film that still holds up well to this day. But I thought that it wouldn't hurt to have it updated and revamped as most werewolf movies are a big joke today, especially with? shudder? Twilight: Full Moon, may God help us all. But I know that Benicio Del Toro was really looking forward to doing this movie as Lon Chaney is one of his favorite actors and is a major inspiration, so naturally he wanted to be The Wolf Man. But does he fall in the same line as Lon? I don't think so, he's good but doesn't have the same charisma to carry the story well.In 1891, Lawrence Talbot reunites with his father following the disappearance of his brother. Lawrence Talbot's childhood ended the night his mother died. After he left the sleepy Victorian hamlet of Blackmoor, he spent decades recovering and trying to forget. But when his brother's fiancée, Gwen Conliffe, tracks him down to help find her missing love, Talbot returns home to join the search. He learns that something has been killing the villagers, and that a Scotland Yard inspector named Aberline has come to investigate. As he pieces together the puzzle, he hears of an ancient curse that turns the afflicted into werewolves when the moon is full. Talbot must destroy the vicious creature in the woods surrounding Blackmoor to end the killings and protect the woman he has grown to love.While the film's atmopshere is incredible, this will be a great Halloween film to show in the future, the film unfortunately let me down over all with the characters. I think it depended too much on the CGI and also that the audience has seen the original Wolf Man. The thing about a remake is that I don't want to see the same thing as the original, I want to see something with a different twist of events. While the story does have it's own take, it still doesn't work as well. But there are some great things about this movie, like the kill scenes that just had me cringing and almost jumping out of my seat. When the film gets going, it does not let go and continues in the non stop scares. Also Anthony Hopkins always delivers a great performance, he just has the perfect grin to keep himself going as the big bad tough guy of the film and was very intense. Emily Blunt was good, but unlike the original story, she's not really needed for this one. Benicio Del Toro is good, but didn't really excite me like I thought he would. But still I think the film was pretty good in setting it's atmosphere and mood, the effects were good over all and the death scenes make it all worth the watch. As a film that stands on it's own, it's good, as it stands to the original, I think I would be just fine with the 1941 version and be happy with that story, even if it is a little dated.6/10</fullReview>

The ending wasn't as great as it could have been, the fight between the werewolves was pretty lame and short. The rest of the movie was good. The cast was awesome, Hopkins and Toro=AWESOME. Their characters were cool, but their dialogue wasen't. Hopkins was a stale (He is 73 so what to expect) I think that Toro was great, he did all he could with his character. The rest of the cast was average. I thought that they could have written better dialogue and sometimes Hopkins lost his charisma.The makeup and the costumes in this movie was so cool. It looks like the original werewolf horror movie costumes which makes this flick a lovable movie.This is a great horror movie, but an average film. I recommend you to see it, overall it's an awesome movie.This movie gets 7,5/10Don't take this movie to serious, its meant to be silly, it's a horror flick!Enjoy</fullReview>

What a disappointment that he would lend his prestige to this miserable creature. They must have liquored him up to get him to sign on to this clunker. I remember watching the original Wolfman back in the 1950's and it really was scary but this script lets you know what's coming and when (Oh no!!! a full moon!!!) so there isn't much of a jolt to any scene. One other thing struck me as I sat watching: the sound track seemed totally inconsistent with the visual images on a couple of occasions, perhaps a consequence of the reported reediting(s)?Wait for cable.</fullReview>

Del Torro, Weaving and Hopkins are doing great job with Weaving who manages to steal most of the movie. The story is boring and after first 30 mins it goes down big time (seems like a trend in Hollywood, so you wont return your ticket). Character development is good cosidering A-class cast, although beast actions are questionable in many cases: at one point it kills hordes or people, later it struggles to kill one man. The final fight is pretty disappointing and finishes quicker than it starts. Computer Graphics is really bad. One second you can see character with wolf make up, next his paw is computer generated which kills all authenticy the movie pose to have. Do not recommend in cinemas or on your TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wolfman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wolf Man from 1941 starring Lon Chaney Jr., Bela Lugosi and Claude Rains is a great classic horror film, and has been the inspiration for many werewolf films ever since, so it was interesting to learn that it would be remade nearly seventy years later, from director Joe Johnston (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Jumanji, Jirassic Park III). Basically, set in the 19th Century, the 1880's, Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) during his childhood suffered the death of his mother and was sent to an insane asylum, but he is returning to his sleepy hamlet home town of Blackmoor, having been tracked down by his brother's fiancée Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt). He returns to the estate of his father Sir John Talbot (Sir Anthony Hopkins), and his brother has been murdered, with his body mauled by an unknown bloodthirsty creature of the night, so he sets out to find the killer, and he discovers a terrifying destiny for himself, one that has haunted the family for years. Searching for the monster, and trying to combat his childhood demons, Lawrence one night witnesses the terror of an attack, and he gets attacked himself and bares a mark, and as a result he is now cursed himself to become a creature, when the full moon appears in the sky he transforms into a ferocious werewolf. He is now trying to hide from the people of the village, especially ruthless detective Inspector Francis Aberline (Hugo Weaving), who will realise what he has become, but he does end up caught at one point, only to escape when transforming, and Gwen realises the danger he is, but of course as the werewolf he will not recognise and kill her, but she still wants to save him. The end sees Lawrence as the creature discovering that his father is also a werewolf himself, and he was obviously the one who killed his mother, the two fight and Lawrence ends up killing his own father, and when Gwen is cornered during a rampage she has no choice but to shoot and kill him with a gun loaded with a silver bullet, this was his fate all along. Also starring Geraldine Chaplin as Maleva, Art Malik as Singh, Antony Sher as Dr. Hoenneger, Simon Merrells as Ben Talbot, Clive Russell as MacQueen, David Schofield as Constable Nye, makeup artist Rick Baker as Gypsy Man / First Killed. Del Toro is okay as the man who falls victim to the deadly curse, Hopkins gets his small moments as the father with a dark streak, Blunt does alright as the English rose who wants to love the man who is a monster, and well known supporting cast members get something interesting to do as well. The story sticks to pretty much the same plot as the original film, the special effects are obviously necessary but are impressive, and the makeup effects are fantastic and deserved their accolade, obviously this doesn't have the same impact and charm as the original, but this isn't a bad remake horror thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Makeup. Worth watching!</fullReview>

The sets were amazing, The acting was so-so in many parts. The special effects were fine. The story was ABSURD! Who wrote this junk. Why couldn't they expand the original story and build on that. Where was Bela's character, where was the sign of the pentagram. Why was the father a wolf man also? Ridiculous. The fight scene at the end was beyond description. Everyone seemed to know that there was a werewolf and immediately accepted it. Moronic! I can't even compare this to VanHelsing. I thought VanHelsing was a far superior movie in many ways. Although it was extremely campy and silly, it played like a comic book and didn't try to aspire to anything further. This was the destruction of the one of the great Universal Classics.

		<fullReview>It's hard, it has to be, to be a filmmaker in the 21st century intent on remaking a genre classic like Universal's legendary The Wolf Man. You're going to find yourself, much like The Wolfman (the remake loses a space) director Joe Johnston has maybe found himself, square in damned if you do and damned if you don't territory. You're handed the keys to the kingdom, you find yourself responsible for a profoundly important cultural artifact like wolfie, and you have to deliver. Do you "update" and "re-imagine" and risk the absolute thrashing you'll take, word-of-mouth, from the reverent nerd crowd? Or do you go old fashioned, do it faithful and old-school, and risk alienating audiences more used to slasher flicks and Werewolf versus Dracula inside the Techno Dome techno-monster thrillers like Underworld? Thankfully (to this nerd, any way) Johnston went old school. Way old school. His remake features Benecio and Anthony Hopkins as the cursed father and son of Blackmoor, competing beasts cursed by fate to burst into full mane every full moon and tear up the hedgerows of the sleepy countryside. The wolfman in The Wolfman is no sleek CGI beast - we're talking full on Lon Chaney Jr. man-with-a-hairy-face style beast-man style, and it's both silly and impossibly great to see, thanks to the diligent old-fashioned hair-by-hair makeup by Rick Baker.That they did it, that they were faithful to the original aesthetic and idea of the 1941 original is near enough to make me happy, if only because it could have been so, so much worse. As it is, the film is herky-jerky, rushing at a sprint through important character moments and then slowing to an inexplicable crawl when there's not really much going on. Emily Blunt, del Toro and Hopkins are all as good as they could be, but where they succeed wildly as actors in creating a dreadful, haunted atmosphere they fail due to a poor script at creating much in the way of emotional resonance. The film is beautiful, dark and gloomy and spectacularly well designed but at the same time leaden, morose and not in any way affecting. It crawls and sprints, it looks great when it doesn't look hilariously goofy, the characters are mysteries to us and to each other, and it falls way short of both the original and the grand dank tragedy it was trying to be. It could, though, have been a million times worse. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sins of the father</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I enjoyed "The Wolfman," it was not nearly as good as I was hoping it would be. I long for good, old-fashioned horror movies and monster movies that are genuinely scary and don't necessarily rely on gore or violence to elicit fearful responses from the viewer?and "The Wolfman" delivered a mix of genuine horror and suspense accented with a very generous dollop of gore and violence. Benicio Del Toro and Anthony Hopkins were both all right, and Emily Blunt seems to be cornering the market on assertive-Victorian-woman roles, but the script treats lycanthropy as a metaphor for toxic fatherhood, so the entire story devolves into a facile Freudian/Biblical drama of the sins of the father.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anthony Hopkins, Hugo Weaving and Rick Baker make-up make good on their talent. the rest of it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm still not sure how to peg Joe Johnston as a director. With The Wolfman, I see that he can direct some R-rated action and horror/gore, and that he has a great sense of how to stage action scenes and fights and chases. I also see, again, after Jurassic Park 3 and other movies (sans October Sky, which is quite good, and Rocketeer which I can't remember), that actors are left to fend for themselves, and, sadly, many parts of his films are just dull or not very involving emotionally. He's all about bombast and action, and not so much about the engagement of other actors in scenes (whether or not I missed something from Hidalgo I can't say, and Honey I Shrunk the Kids is... well, it's what it is).Now I could harp on how much the film lost on it's original director, Mark Romanek (awesome music video director and whose one feature, One Hour Photo, is one of the most underrated films of the past decade), walked away from the production just before it started filming. But the film is what it is now, and it should be taken on its own terms. And on those terms, it's a mixed bag. We get the story told again, not the first or the last time, of the wolfman, named here after Lon Chaney's wolfman Lawrence Talbot, and how he's bitten by the wolf on the full moon and turns again to hunt anyone he sees on the moor in England. This story it told without a shred of humor, at least not intentionally, and is dark and gloomy and features foggy set pieces and looming trees at night and Victorian-era sets in full style.At the least it's a fine film to look at, and an example of a handsomely mounted production, and two actors who totally 'get' how the film goes. Anthony Hopkins as the elder Talbot is creepy and scene-chewing, especially when he gets some big scene-stealing bits in the climax, and Hugo Weaving as Aberline (former inspector on the Jack Ripper case) is bad-ass without having to say a word. But the performance by Benicio Del-Toro as Talbot, who also produced the film, is surprisingly unconvincing. Or rather, it might be convincing as a dour, sad-sack guy who has some right to be depressed (mother committed suicide as a kid), he's just not very moving. He brings scenes down that should have more power to them, and mumbles through some scenes that need a strong actor playing against Hopkins and Weaving (Emily Blunt is decent in her role, but is given less to do than anyone). Considering how good of an actor Del-Toro has shown he can be over the years- Fear &amp; Loathing, Sin City, Traffic, Che- it's a big disappointment.And while Johnston gets caught up in moving to the next big set piece, even he, who is a flawed director with The Wolfman, has his moments. When Talbot is in an insane asylum at one point in the film, we get a series of surreal visions and things seen that make it a little more than the average horror movie (statues talking, father-son psychological craziness, sexual and violent frenzy). And of course having Rick Baker on the make-up is about as "made-of-Win" as possible (albeit having to contend with the CGI with the wolf transformations, which aren't half-bad). There's a lot of pluses and minuses with this film, plenty of things that make it a satisfying genre movie in a classical sense, and a lot of things that make it unconvincing and just too self-serious. The Wolfman is worth seeing, but not an essential horror film. It's one of those.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As the cliché goes, a missed opportunity at greatness. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 'Wolf Man' proved to be a fantastic, influential horror film which withstood the test of time with style. It came as a surprise that a large proportion of the horror community gradually began anticipating the eventual remake (including myself), in the midst of this harshly received and seemingly never ending barrage of them.Tonight, after many delays and rumoured production problems, I finally managed to catch a screening of this Wolfman re imagining... Was it as good as the original? No. Did it live up to the hype? No. Did it have redeeming qualities? Yes.The main and most noticeable issue here was the horrendous editing and pacing. Think of it like a gaping hole where the infamous screaming face should be in 'The Scream'. The acting and cinematography was amazing, but the glue that should hold all it all together was no where to be found. All the faults you heard about in post-production were sadly true.It's a darn shame, because everything else seemed sublime. Shelly Johnson, Phil Harvey and John Dexter managed to do justice to the original with their starkly beautiful images providing sheer candy for the eyes. It all came together to construct a stunning atmosphere full of dread... it was only too bad the editing constantly murdered any hope of sufficient tension to go along with it.The cast was brilliant. Weaving and Hopkins managed to steal the show with their immense acting talents shown in somewhat gala fashion; they went out there, with all the fan respect they each have on their shoulders, and simply chewed scenery, plus, most importantly, had fun. It paid off greatly in their net performances.Del Toro and Blunt also went quite well. They obviously didn't have the expertise as the above two men, but their on-screen relationship nevertheless oozed chemistry, and even left me a little heartbroken by the end (which is always good).Andrew Kevin Walker's phenomenal screenplay had it's flourishes, but ultimately lost most of it's magic in the motions of this transitional nightmare.In the end, The Wolfman is (as the cliché goes) a severely missed opportunity at greatness. It was a film that didn't deserve the sh-t it went through in post-production. But then again, I hear they'll restore 17 minutes of cut footage on the DVD... so I'll probably wind up waiting eagerly... again.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just came back after watching this film. The acting was fantastic especially Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins and Hugo Weaving the "Mr Anderson" guy from the Matrix. The werewolf transformations and make up were awesome ,the settings were perfect, the gore was extreme which made the film more genuine but on a bad note I felt that the film pace was inconsistent and the storyline was rushed. Unlike Sleepy Hollow which I think some of the ideas in this film came from I didn't feel constantly excited about what would happen next and would wait a long time to see this film again. I gave the film 6 out of 10 as I feel credit is deserved to the main actors in the film, the make up and special effects crew, and the stage crew but felt the writers let me down as this remake should have set the standard and made it worth waiting so long for.</fullReview>

Very good special effects but definitely not as scary as American Werewolf in London (walking on the moors)but the attacks on helpless, and even armed humans, was better than Underworld. As far as storyline goes, the flashbacks are a little confusing unless you just tell yourself "Hey this is an alternate universe where it's 1891, the days are almost as dark as night, eastern European gypsies have set up a wagon train in the upper england countryside, the asylum is NOT a bed and breakfast, and the local candlestick maker is the richest man in town." Well OK, the acting was great, the sets impressive, costumes first class. So why do I feel towards the end of it all like I want to just get up and leave? I think it's because I don't relate to the characters much. No sympathy at all to any of the them. Overall there wasn't the campy special-effect horror movie expectation like Van Helsing and I give it a solid 7...but this won't join my DVD collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE WOLFMAN (Joe Johnston, 2010) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a long-awaited, thus much-anticipated, remake of a classic monster movie from the heyday of Universal Studios' reign over the horror genre; the behind-the-scenes vicissitudes which saw a change of director early on were offset by an avowed reverence for the subject/source by its makers (star/co-producer Benicio Del Toro even holds vintage "Wolf Man" memorabilia in his personal collection!) that was clearly absent from THE MUMMY (1999). The decision to transpose the setting from 1940s Wales (or, more precisely, Hollywood's idea of it) to Victorian England (even incorporating the real-life Scotland Yard Inspector in charge of the gruesome "Ripper" murders) works to the film's benefit, resulting in an epic scale (where the originals were essentially "B" movies) and oodles of fog-laden atmosphere (not forgetting shadowy candle-lit interiors). So far so good: the trouble starts when we get to the storyline and the characterization, and while the special effects were reasonably impressive (I honestly felt restless throughout the preliminary exposition as I was anxious to see how these were going to turn out and what the creature's final look would be) ? though I still prefer Rick Baker's work on the as-yet-unsurpassed AN American WEREWOLF IN London (1981) ? they fell flat whenever CGI reared its ugly head; I was not bothered by the sight of the monster running on all fours, but the rapid-leaping-across-rooftops scenes did bring back unpleasant memories of the travesty that was VAN HELSING (2004)! It was perhaps inevitable but also unwise to pilfer 75 years of cinematic lycanthropy for this one movie, since this is pretty much done without rhyme or reason (so much for its would-be rigor towards Curt Siodmak's 1941 script!): if you are to reference the legendary curse, why misquote it ("wolf(s)bane") and have it come in at the very start and then never again?!; and where is the interaction ? which was basically the heart of the old Universal series ? between Lawrence Talbot and the gypsy woman Maleva (here played by a wizened Geraldine Chaplin)? That said, the forest sequences are indeed redolent of the Lon Chaney Jr. movies; however, the impossible love story (why does every horror legend have to be re-worked to this end?!), actually harks back to Hammer's underrated THE CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF (1961). As for the dream sequences, they would like to evoke the 1981 John Landis werewolf masterpiece mentioned above (another nod to it is the casting of tell-tale local David Schofield, now the constable who gets skewered through the mouth during the ill-advised gypsy caravan fracas) but actually come closer to the scare-for-scare's-sake which typifies much of the recent "J-Horror" style! As I said earlier, there is much that is wrong with the plot: again, what was the point of making Del Toro's protagonist an actor (unless it was to have Anthony Hopkins play around with the celebrated 'To Be Or Not To Be' line from "Hamlet" and, to be sure, the elder Talbot showed much greater flair for performance throughout ? in spite of Hopkins' atypical restraint ? than our relentlessly glum hero!) if no association at all is made between this gift and the new-found duality of his nature?! What to make of the whole tragic back-story of the Talbots which, apart from the ludicrous (and apparently nonchalant) propensity for self-destruction, exhibits grave narrative lapses?! The asylum sequences, too, did not belong in this movie (they seem to have strayed in from one of Paul Naschy's series of "Waldemar Daninsky" werewolf flicks and, who knows, maybe it was a deliberate nod in their direction!) ? but, as with the afore-mentioned forest massacre, it is here that we get sole humorous respite from the overwhelmingly gloomy proceedings. The Danny Elfman score, while characteristic enough of his style, feels a bit too similar to Wojchiech Kilar's powerful/melancholy soundtrack for BRAM STOKER'S Dracula (1992) ? in which Hopkins had gone all-out with an incongruously batty Van Helsing! By the way, one more interesting point I picked up here is how the Welsh thespian's role ends up being a variation not on the archetypal vampire hunter but rather his stab at yet another legendary figure in THE MASK OF ZORRO (1998)! For a devotee' of classic horror, I did not mind the plentiful gore on display but I could have done without the climactic werewolf one-on-one (all-too-obviously citing the most conventional lycanthrope picture of recent times, WOLF [1994]) ? though I would venture to say that the flaming monster was a first within such a prolific genre ? and the frankly crap way a sequel is set up (again, how could they bring in the silver-topped cane from the original and not adopt it as the weapon with which to set Lawrence Talbot free?!). As often happens with modern films, my overly-critical comments above somewhat belie the "Good" rating I bestowed upon it: truth be told, I considerably enjoyed the experience of watching THE WOLFMAN (which, I guess, is what really matters!) but it also does not seem to bear close scrutiny...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The special effects are here but the acting not so much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well a movie that features Anthony Hopkins, Hugo Weaving and Benicio Del Toro among the stars seems promising enough. The visual affects, scenery and make up all the set the stage. Plus the dark atmosphere really sets the mood for a good old fashioned werewolf movie. But you would be wrong. The acting fails to be on par with the nice visuals and make up. The story is average and the direction isn't great either. And at times the story is a bit cliché. Which, probably sounds redundant for a werewolf movie but it's cliché in ways outside of the werewolf genre. Surprisingly Hugo Weaving is the best actor in this sub par movie. The other actors look lost in comparison to him with the exception of Hopkins whose acting was good at times. Del Toro seems the most lost out of the main characters. He's good as a supporting actor but he doesn't have enough acting chops to be the lead character. Weaving's great acting isn't enough to save this movie. But if you're willing to see it for the werewolf horror story line you might want to save yourself some money and wait for the DVD or catch it on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incomplete transformation ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After learning that his brother has disappeared, Lawrence Talbot (Benecio Del Toro), returns to his family estate to find that his brother was the victim of a ferocious attack. Lawrence decides to find out what happened to his brother all while trying to juggle relations with his brothers fiancée, Gwen (Emily Blunt), and his alienating father, Sir John (Anthony Hopkins). Inevitably, Lawrence is attacked in the same manner as his brother but manages to survive. This only leads to him being cursed with a transformation into a werewolf during a full moon.1880's England is a lovely sight to behold from the opening minutes of the film and the gloomy weather, architecture and somewhat sombre tone of the film only go to visually highlight the very important Gothic themes with which the film will utilize. Thankfully this remains a constant throughout the film for the narrative does not. The story starts off interestingly enough with increasing debate as to whether a beast or lunatic is going around killing people. The plot thickens when it is discovered that Lawrence himself was placed in a mental asylum when he was younger and the introduction of Scotland Yard inspector Aberline (Hugo Weaving) gives the film the very sense of mystery it needs. Though Aberline does very little in terms of tangible investigation as the film's opening few arcs fall away to some very quick plot reveals. And this is one of the major problems with the film's story as a whole: so much is revealed so quickly that the last third to quarter of the film contains nothing for the narrative beyond a poorly conceived romance between Gwen and Lawrence. This, in turn, only happens because character development in terms of relations is not fully realized. If anything, the asylum arc of the film is very enjoyable next to some fun, albeit rather violent, action sequences. And the inclusions of some genuinely good horror elements add to the dynamic, even if lacking, narrative.The acting performances are also somewhat on the weaker side. Del Toro and Blunt seemed somewhat distracted. Of course the death of Ben Talbot (Simon Merrells) lingers over both of them but their melancholy never feels real. Both do become progressively better by the films end but never really enough to show what both are capable of. Hopkins has an intriguing role as the protagonist's father who lives in the family estate by himself but his character lacks the emotional impact to allow much from Hopkins. Weaving is the best of the lot and gives his character the life he needs to appear as both a concerned inspector of the law, while also a figure that could potentially see his duty as above common humanity. Weaving's character is not explored enough so his screen time can feel limited at times.On a better note the technical aspects of the film are quite compelling. The very bleak look of the films setting hits hard the atmosphere that is to be expected from the remainder of the film. The CGI and special effects are largely good enough to help capture the Gothic essence but there is the odd moment where it seems poorly implemented, such as when there is a close-up of the werewolf running at a high speed. Architecture is used well with costume design clearing indicating towards as faithful a recreation of 1880's England as possible. Lastly the look of the werewolf himself is workable and exudes a promising menacing force for a monster film.There is no sex and almost as little use of language. There is no direct nudity but a female character is shown from behind without a top on. Violence makes up for what is missing however, with some violent, bloody and gory sequences involving decapitations and other more beastly attempts at mutilation. As expected, these are all done during the night which somewhat blankets the violence but nevertheless it can be quite explicit even though the deaths are not lingered on for long.There is much to love in the opening half of The Wolfman as it sets itself up for a potentially thrilling finale. But for all the intense Gothic atmospheric inclusions that the film uses for its foundation, such as the costume design, CGI and scale of the visual treat that is 1880's England, it nevertheless falls apart by the films end. If you wish for a dark and bloody exposition on a werewolf then you should be satisfied, but that does not stop some underwhelming performances and a thin narrative from impending the transformation of excellent ideas into an excellent film. At one point Sir John exclaims: 'The beast will have its day' but for now The Wolfman will have to do until that day comes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible movie with a few good scenes and good lines by Hopkins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie, and I had been expecting a lot but I must say I was very disappointed. Instead of building suspense it relies on shocks and effects. There is really nothing to the story. Hopkins is great as always, playing a sort of Hannibal monster role again, and he has a few great Shakespearian lines. Also I really liked some individual scenes but the whole movie put together is really not that good. The female lead has about as much charisma as a hamster, and none of the other actors, except for the Jack the Ripper-hunter and policeman and Hopkins distinguish themselves in any way. All things considered, a great disappointment. Moreover, is this 2010? Surely CGI can be used much better than in this movie. "Avatar" uses CGI much, much better. Anyway, I guess the movie is worth seeing for fantasy-fans, and one can, of course, make up one's own mind whether he or she likes it or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We actually went to the theater to see another premiere, Percy Jackson and the Olympians, but it was too crowded and a lot of kids so we went to see The Wolfman instead. Before i start my review, i would like to point out that i am a junkie to films like these like Van Helsing or a bit more modern Underworld. Be it vampires, werewolves or something similar, they have always intrigued me. Couldn't miss out on The Wolfman now could i?I personally had high expectations ever since the trailer, even though i never was a big fan of Johnston's films. The actors on the other side being Hopkins, Del Toro and the wonderful Emily Blunt had caught my eye. The story starts out quite promising, building momentum and a somewhat mysterious approach on a few of the characters. For the first 30 minutes or so i think this movie had the makings to be a great film, however this was quickly abrupted. As you will see for yourself (if you still want to see this movie), the character dress ups, especially on closeups looked downright horrible. The detailing itself is OK which saved it from being an utter loss. If you're not such a film critic as myself and you have not seen comparable movies you might think this is OK - which will partially lead you to rating this film higher than myself.Next to that you'll see that a few of those classic shock/scare moments that build up via sound and scene are quite predictable. I can honestly say i knew how the movie would turnout halfway through (and we didn't even have intermission at this theater!).The acting was not bad, the story was. Emily Blunt certainly did a good job in her role, i guess Del Toro was OK as well, even though the accent was not in place. Hopkins is still good on his old day.Overall, it's not that bad if you just want to see some thrill and action, there's even some "horror" as the genre suggests. So in the end, it breaks down to this; Looking for a Top 250 movie or box office hit? You wont find it here. However, worth to skip? No. You can still enjoy this movie, but do it on DVD or Blu-ray, don't waste the money on a cinema ticket!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why are you seeing The Wolfman? Are you expecting a beautifully told tale with a massive beating heart of emotion and poignancy? Or lots of scares and gruesome violence that feels right at home alongside Daybreakers? If the latter is all you desire then prepare to be satisfied. If, like me, you were hoping for the former then perhaps you should give this a miss on the big screen. Here you will find plenty of potential for the introspective drama Wolfman could (and should) have been, but not much follow through. Apparently it was edited pretty heavily for the theatrical version so the Director's Cut DVD may rectify this problem. Let's also pray they dispatch with the unnecessary and tacky gore that, quite simply, cheapens this story.There are other issues that the DVD won't be able to mend though. Danny Elfman's intrusive and overbearing score for starters. Or more importantly the atrocious makeup of the beast himself. There are many out there who believe CGI is too frequently used, and they may be right, however Rick Baker's makeup for Talbot's hairy alter ego is a step in the wrong direction for the advocacy of practical effects. When we see del Toro transform into the title character with the help of computer effects, it is entirely believable, yet when we see him as the fully fledged Wolfman under Baker's hand it is hard not to chuckle.It's not all bad mind you; the ominous and moody cinematography from Shelly Johnson sets an eerie atmosphere whilst Rick Heinrichs production design delivers a terrifically gloomy 19th century England. And the cast hardly put a foot wrong. Del Toro gives an achingly conflicted portrayal of Talbot and Blunt continues her dream run with another convincing performance, but more on their relationship would have been very welcomed ? something else to add to the Director's Cut DVD wish list I suppose. Surprisingly Hopkins is the weak link as Lawrence's father - every now and then it almost seems like he doesn't want to be there - whilst Weaving brings the perfect amount of arrogance and class to wonder-cop Inspector Abberline.A few tweaks here and there and Wolfman could have been very good. As it stands it barely claws above average.2.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely atmosphere, little else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of anticipation has preceded the release of this film, having been delayed for year due to reshoots, and with precious little in the way of teaser images being thrown to the hungry public. So...what's the final film like? Very disappointing. The dreary, gloomy atmosphere and dark photography is all the film has going for it. But the weak script lets everything else down. There is zero tension and some of the key action scenes, especially the attack on the gypsy camp, are poorly directed. I usually have no problem with Joe Johnstone has he's proved himself to be a capable fantasy director in the past with Jumanji and Jurassic Park 3 but here he fumbles every horror moment.I appreciate the gore and blood effects, mostly all of it is make-up but there are some horrible CGI shots. However, the shots of explicit gore seem pasted on and don't quite fit the overwhelmingly downbeat tone.All of the actors look bored and disconnected. Benicio Del Toro is usually watchable in anything, as is Anthony Hopkins though they look like they'd rather be elsewhere and reading better lines from a better script.It could have been a decent expansion of the 70-minute original from 1941, but even at 102 minutes it still feels like something is missing. A slower pace, a better build-up and a more carefully-written script would have made this a great film. After all the anticipation what we have eventually been given is a careless let-down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad...but could have been better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am quite the horror movie buff and those who know me also understand I love all sorts of movies in the genre. A-movies and B-movies all have their own luster.That being said, this movie ranks high in special effects and cast, but just seems to come up short in the whole "horror" aspect. Not to say the movie is campy or anything, but it seems to feel plodding. It's almost to depressive. Parts of the plot seem disjointed and I really feel Benicio Del Toro did not fit the role of Talbot. Too serious and unemotional.The monster effects were good, but somehow the creature makeup was just not scary. Something more primal, that could jumpstart the imagination, would have been better. There is nothing more visceral in werewolf movies than the monster and it's transformation. (American Werewolf in London and The Howling) still do it the best.A good popcorn popper, but it won't dethrone any serious werewolf films of yore anytime soon. Watch an enjoy, or just wait for the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's a Reason for the Delays</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wolfman, The (2010) * 1/2 (out of 4) After countless delays, Universal's remake of their 1941 film finally hit theaters and perhaps it would have been best left on the shelf. In the film Benicio Del Toro plays Lawrence Talbot who returns home to find out what thing killed his brother. His father (Anthony Hopkins) warns him not to go out in the full moon but he does anyway and he's bitten by a werewolf and soon taking shape himself. I'm really not sure where to start with this thing but I do have to scratch my head when I hear $150 million was spent on this film and I have to wonder why some of that couldn't have gone for a better screenplay. This is yet another horror movie that lacks any suspense or surprises and instead just delivers a bunch of fake looking gore. I lost track of how many heads, fingers, arms and legs were actually cut off but I didn't lose count of the suspense scenes because it was zero. Just take a look at the scene early on where the gypsy community is attacked. We get bad CGI effects of the werewolf running around taking bites out of people but there's not an ounce of suspense in the build up and even before this scene we get the brother being attacked without a single jump. We get the usual loud noise that is taking over horror films to try and get people to jump but then we get this followed up with the beast jumping out just as we expect him to. The film tries to play it straight but there's a really embarrassing sequence of humor when Talbot is tied down so doctors can watch that this werewolf stuff is just in his mind. The know-it-all doctor just keeps talking and talking as Talbot takes form in the background. The humor here just doesn't work because who in there right mind wouldn't hear what was going on behind them by a couple feet? The performances are a mixed bag but Hopkins comes off the best as the mysterious father. He gets to deliver a few good lines and he appears to be having fun in the role. Emily Blunt is decent but she isn't given too much to do except really take part in a horrendous ending. Then there's Del Toro who has proved himself to be a great actor but he just isn't right for the role here. His dark, moody tone is on full display here and to me it just wasn't right to have no emotion or sympathy for the character. A lot of this can be blamed on the screenplay that keeps the Talbot character at the same note before and after the attack. The special effects by Rick Baker are good in places but the added benefit of CGI isn't doing anyone any favors and the CGI really doesn't help each scene it's in especially in the really fake looking skies. As with most remakes these days, this one here gives a few nice winks to the original film but one can't help but walk out of this thing disappointed. If you want nothing but violence and gore you might want to give it a shot but I've come to expect more and especially for the price tag.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't get drawn into their mind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(My partner's review): It looked really cool when they showed the trailer of it on TV.I thought, or I was hoping that it will be one of those movies that is a blockbuster type of movie, yet it would have human aspects, too. The kind of movie I like. Maybe I was thinking it was gonna be something like Spiderman 1, or Hulk (by Ang Lee). Movies with big budgets and famous actors, based on legends or comic books, yet, containing humans' feelings. The movies in which I feel empathy for the characters-- those movies are a success. This movie could have been a success if I had felt, or understood the feelings of the characters, but it didn't convey that. For example, Anthony Hopkins' character doesn't appeal to me. If his twisted unethical feelings for his son's fiancée had felt real to me, then it would have been OK. If I had felt the feelings of Benicio's and the woman's for each other were real, it would have been OK. If Benicio's frustration of being a monster came across as real, it would have been OK. Basically, I didn't feel like I was feeling what they were going through inside of the mind and head. I was left out. I didn't get drawn into their mind. Once again, it's very important who's the director, or a combination of a lot of things, or just pure luck.The plot was all right, I guess. At least I wanted to know how this disaster, caused by monsters, would end. I sort of was hoping there would be some interesting end. I don't think anything was original, e.g., camera work, action, computer graphics. Benicio is one of the few positive things about the movie. He's good looking, stylish, and very cool. He makes me think that it'd be cool to be him.I have seen so many bad movies lately, I didn't feel like this movie was too bad in comparison. 6 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>boring film - amazing set designs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You'd think with several decades since the original, this remake would have some clever twists to entertain us with. Nothing.If you know that survivors of wolfman bites turn into a wolfman during a full moon then this movie will bore you to tears unless you savor predictability.The gore isn't all that. There were maybe two decent kills and a bunch of run off the mill deaths. Hugo weaving delivered lines as if he was stuck inside the Matrix and Emily Blunt gave us side boob (thank you very much).The set designers deserve an Oscar (if there's such a category). Super well done. The rest however, sucked wolfman balls.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film certainly has claws but they are just not as sharp as one would like them to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in the village of Blackmore and the city of London in 1891, a man named Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) returns home from his theatrical stint in America to investigate the death of his brother Ben (Simon Merrells). Ben was clearly murdered because the body has been brutally mutilated by someone or something. Lawrence stays with his father John (Anthony Hopkins), and promises his brother's lover Gwen (Emily Blunt) that he will find out what happened. Yet during an attack on a village by the mysterious beast Lawrence is bitten and he finds himself changing into the monster during each full moon, with an uncontrollable bloodlust. As his regular self during the day though, he is shielded from the wrath of the villagers by Gwen and they start a romance together. Meanwhile, a Scotland Yard detective (Hugo Weaving) is hot on the heels of Lawrence and his alter ego, well aware of the time he spent in a mental institution.From Jumanji to Jurassic Park III Joe Johnston has made a number of action and adventure romps, but The Wolfman is certainly one of his darkest films. This is a terribly violent and moody horror film, one that is humourless and certain in its tone. It is more grounded in its fiction, unlike some of the more cartoonish monster movies such as Van Helsing. The effectiveness of the tone can largely be attributed to the efforts of Johnston, his set designs and the art direction. The dimly lit Gothic architecture of the film and the mist covered woods inspire a creepy and chilling atmosphere and firm tension levels throughout much of the film. The violence here is highly graphic and perhaps overly extreme, with heads and limbs being ripped off in full view, but this also serves to accentuate the dangers of the Wolfman himself and certifies the film's serious tone, rather a comical representation of the character. There are a number of very obvious but extremely effective scares and jumps throughout the film and the action involving the beast moves at a cracking pace.Where the film disappoints though is in its screenplay, which was written by Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self. This is essentially just a slasher film that never takes the audience anywhere particularly new. There are some initially promising signs for the film in the opening quarter. The flashbacks to when Lawrence as a young boy emerged from his home to see the throat of his mother slashed, along with the discussion of the time he spent in a mental institution, suggest that there will be some interesting psychological developments throughout the story. Yet these background details are scarce and are more inclined to compliment the horror, rather than to explore the psychosis of Lawrence, limiting the films character development and internal struggles. Furthermore, the film insists on including a superfluous romantic subplot between Lawrence and Gwen that really stems from nowhere. Its impact on the climax of the film does not deliver the emotional punch that it would like to.Given the quality of the screenplay and the limited material, the performances are also just as uneven. Del Toro slips in and out of his American and Spanish accents and has fairly limited dialogue. Yet physically he still carries the sense that he has the weight of the world on his shoulders and the glum look in his tired eyes hint at his fractured past as well. Hugo Weaving is even better, with his presence and his charisma igniting what might have been a largely forgettable role on paper. Blunt is largely wasted with the simplicity of the love story though and Hopkins is just odd with a rambling performance, attempting to mix his usual wise old man caricature with something more sinister. The real star of this film though is the wolfman himself and the efforts towards his makeup and the special effects are very strong. The horrendous look of the beast has certainly not been comprised for younger audiences here.The Wolfman is passable entertainment because it will satisfy those that are looking for scares and high quantities of blood and gore. The aesthetics, from the set design to the bleak lighting, make this is an atmospheric and often intense thrill ride with a number of jumpy moments. Those expecting something less conventional, refreshing or intelligent will be disappointed by the uneven performances and the script, which does not take the concept anywhere new or meaningful. The film certainly has claws but they are just not as sharp as one would like them to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wolfman Bites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes are not your friend. Regardless, they are an inevitable fact of entertainment these days. I won't go as far as to say that it's possible to do them right, but there are circumstances that make them easier to accept. For the 2010 version of The Wolfman you know the idea is to update a 69-year-old film with new effects. If that were all it takes to create a great remake, the Oscar ballots would need rewriting.Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) is a supposed successful stage actor residing in London during the 1880s. When news reaches him that his brother is missing, he hastens to his family's estate in Blackmoor to join the search. Once there, his father John (Anthony Hopkins) informs him that his brother's body has been found and it appears that a large unknown animal is the culprit. After questioning some locals, Lawrence comes face-to-face with the beast and in a hairy encounter (I couldn't help it) he is maimed.To Lawrence's surprise his survival has begot him the curse of lycanthropy; a full moon will cause him to transform into a werewolf. While eluding detective Abberline (Hugo Weaving), Lawrence must rely on his brother's former fiancée, Gwen (Emily Blunt), as he tries to understand the curse.This isn't the same Wolfman whom you may recall squaring off with Frankenstein's monster. Every attack is amped up with a dose of amputation and decapitation. The Wolfman wastes no time in disposing of countless innocent bodies. The fashion that which it is seen sounds more gruesome in theory, that's because Danny Elfman's excessively loud score dwarfs the film's visuals, making it almost comedic. Elfman's idea of scary-sounding-music is no longer in vogue.Director Joe Johnston has a history with CGI animal-centric productions having helmed Jumanji and Jurassic Park III. His whole repertoire is in effects, and this film doesn't disappoint when it comes to CGI and creature design. The Wolfman is his first project to receive the R rating. Aside from the messy attacks, the look and tone of the film are by contrast friendlier to a general audience. Johnston simply doesn't have the tricks in place to make an unsettling horror film. Not only is the atmosphere to blame, but also the pacing is all over the place. It appears that nothing happens unless there's a full moon. Any time between them is marginalized. What this means is that characters are always dealing with the burden of beast mode, and never feeling human. All we get from Lawrence is that he's an actor who has a family. It would have been far more realistic for his theatre company to make an attempt to contact him, for him to have debts, deadlines, friends, etc.It's so hard to look into a film that's this shallow. All of the characters exist only within the context of the narrative. They never feel fully realized because we never get a glimmer into their typical day. Maybe Benicio is an actor, but I need more than a second of Lawrence on stage to give him the same credit, and even if I do I can see that his occupation plays no factor on the plot. In other regards you get what you expect and with a story this simple there's little room to truly drop the ball. What you get out of this take on The Wolfman are a few people you don't care about being slashed to pieces with little buildup for suspense. The Wolfman bites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has its fair share of lows and minimal action packed highs.Let's talk about the good things first. There are several well-crafted scenes which scare you. The special effects and gore are believable and effective. OK, that's about it.The other 90% of the movie contains drab, run-of-the-mill acting. Benicio and Hopkins seem as if they're reading the script at times and without inflection or true meaning. (This will bore you, keep you uninterested and may even put you to sleep).The Elfking from the movie Lord of the Rings, presents the only solid bit of acting. (They'll probably keep him for Wolfman II).This movie fails to address how, why and when Werewolves acquired the gift of invisibility.For Valentines day, if you want your girl to grab a hold of you, take her to see this movie. If your looking to see a good movie, watch the movie Crazy Heart, which is much much better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Movie but poor (too dark) cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Expected more of a new twist to this 70 year old tale and was disappointed. The movie itself is watchable and has some nice surprises and gore for the fans of the genre - but what I really hated most is the dark lit cinematography. Someone on this board praised the set design: how could one even see the details of the set (less the faces)? Every scene was so dark that no color was ever visible (with the exceptions of daylight outdoor scenes). The interior (for example the Victorian dressings) came out as "dark mesh shadows in the background". The actors faces were dark and in the shadow in front of windows with even darker shades for curtains. The Victorian era had nice colors in greens, red etc. I would prefer any Hammer Film over this "dark ride". Often times I was wondering if someone has turned off all the lights on the set. I got a couple of very recent movies on Blu-Ray (which I have not seen in the cinema) who have all similar problems. It seems to be a new trend in Hollywood. Do directors actually think that this is "artsy" - or are they on hallucination drugs when shooting movies?Billy Wilder once said that if he wants to win the Foreign Film Oscar he has to shoot out of focus. These days the turn off the lights on the set and hope that audience doesn't notice ......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very poor fare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a third-rate horror film with second=rate special effects. John Landis's transformation scenes in an American Werewolf in London, though made 25 years ago is far superior. The story is predictable and boring and has the tension of a snapped elastic band. I thought we had all moved on from the time where the biggest scare was the equivalent of someone jumping out and shouting boo!. I cannot believe the rankings this film has achieved on early showings. The conspiracy theorist in me suggests a lot of film executives voting early and often to boost the ranking before reviewers and word of mouth kill this turkey off. Considering the cast. which is quite impressive, the only explanation for their involvement is the big fat pay check.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They surely tried...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...but again they failed. The movie is full of politically correct bull... about romanian gypsy and feminists, non-suspense action and very bad acting, especially the ever bad Hopkins with his Hannibalistic look, the only look he possesses anyway. Del Toro, the atmosphere, Weaving and the make up are pretty good, but every good scene is followed by another equally bad or even worse so it ruins everything. I strongly recommend the real ones, werewolf of London, The Wolfman with Lon Chaney, Curse Of The Werewolf, The Wolfman 1979 or Paul Naschy's Waldemar Daninsky movies (especially Mark of the Wolfman). This borrows heavily from all of this, and from League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Hannibal and others, and is pretty a failure. Not completely unwatchable tough, if you have nothing to do and it doesn't cost you it worths give a try. You may also see this in cinemas, only for the effort to resurrect a classic. Not more.</fullReview>

One scene is ripped straight out of 'An American werewolf in London' and even though this film has had 30 years on 'AAWIL' the effects manage to look worse. This film lacked substance or drama instead trying to rely on heavily sign posted cheap jumps. The original had a solid story and was as much a tragedy as a horror.I didn't think the character development or the acting in this remake led you to sympathise with any of the characters, as i mentioned before Hopkins was almost pantomime here. So in summary not really my cup of tea and i've not even mentioned Hugo Weaving accent,absolute fluff.</fullReview>
