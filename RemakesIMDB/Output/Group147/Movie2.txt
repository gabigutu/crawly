		<shortDescription>Actioner which borrows most of its ideas from other pictures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fled is a cheerfully illogical actioner which rattles along at a seriously rapid pace without ever pausing for breath. It's stupid and spectacular in equal measure.The plot hardly seems important, but for what it's worth here it is: a Cuban mafia boss has foolishly allowed himself to leave some incriminating evidence on a computer disk. The only guy who knows where the whereabouts of the disk is in a chain gang in the Deep South. An undercover cop is sent to the chain gang to find out where the disk is, and to keep the guy alive when the Cuban hitmen turn up to silence him.The first half of the movie borrows liberally from The Defiant Ones, with Baldwin and Fishburne chained together and fleeing through the swamps from both the good guys and the bad guys. Later on, they reach the big city, and the film then borrows ideas from any police actioner that you could care to mention (Lethal Weapon, The Dead Pool, Tango and Cash, Striking Distance, et al). In fact, the second half of the film consists solely of fist fights and car chases and shootouts, all inspired by similar movies from the genre.Fled never bores you, but it never particularly engages your brain. It is a quickly forgotten film, but it is also the perfect film to watch with your mates while you sink a six-pack of beer and a 16" pizza on a Friday night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mindless chasing and shooting. This one leaves plenty of your mind unoccupied to wonder such things as: How can a guy shoot a three-quarter inch rope with a handgun and miss everything with a shotgun? Why is RuPaul in this movie for 15 seconds? Would the feds really honour a verbal agreement to let you off after you've shot up a lot of folks and a lot of Atlanta? Could a limo really keep up with a Ducatti? Is it true that all you've got to do to get a semi out of your way is to lean on the horn?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FLED is, perhaps, best watched very late at night after a bit of a drink when you don't seem to care about plot holes, bland characters and poor acting. Although not as diabolically awful as other reviewers have made out, this is a pretty bad remake of a great classic. What they seem to have forgotten is that when they made THE DEFIANT ONES, it was at a time where racial awareness was so topical - in FLED the conflict is represented by just one line.The two leads are acceptable, with Laurence Fishburne flexing his fighting skills ready for THE MATRIX. Stephen Bladwin is his usual surly smouldering self, and there is a very small (ie no reason to watch it just for this!) part from Salma Hayek.Although a little overdone, I enjoyed the film references made by Baldwin's character, and you will have a chuckle at the very final one...!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fled is an enjoyable action movie, not as bad as other users said it is, but with nothing special. The bad thing about it is that it's a remake, after a movie titled The Defiant Ones. And of course remakes are inferior movies by definition.Except that, it has all the ingredients of an enjoyable film, very good to watch if you don't want to use your brain too much. The acting is good, there is alot of action, some funny one-liners, a nice ending.All in all, pleasant, but that's it. Vote: 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

I agree that the film has weak spots in the script, but HEY what action film doesn't. I don't think I'll put the film in the TOP 10, but don't forget that there is only place for ten films in the TOP 10.The plot isn't the smartest one, or a reliable one but it's fun, and actually has some shining smart points.If you like action movies in general, you'll like this one for sure.!!Rate: 8 of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very, very average</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As average a film as you'll se. Not much to say on it. Starts off very well with much promise but once they unchain themselves turns into a run of the mill action film, nothing different. One or two of the subplots, the romances especially, seemed trivial. It may even of been a better story had Fishburne not been a copper and a different plot. Quite why they didn't shoot the chain apart when they had the gun I don't know either, but they chose to drive, still attached. No character is especially warming, but there's a good cast, nothing wrong with the acting &amp; great to see old Dex Dexter, Michael Nader in a role, as he was brilliant in Dynasty &amp; never looked even slightly out of place here.Better than it's 4.9 rating, but not by much.6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The odd couple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this is not a film that will mark any new trend in the thriller genre, it's not unpleasant to watch. The director, Kevin Hooks, working on the script written by Preston Whitmore, delivers a an action film that is easy to watch.Preston Whitmore's screen play combines elements from different movies that have been much better, but that said, while it's not breaking any grounds, the film keeps one's interest throughout.Laurence Fishburne and Stephen Baldwin make an odd couple indeed. Mr. Baldwin acts with a blank expression most of the time he is seen. Mr. Fishburne has been around for a while; with the right director he is more effective than what he shows in this movie.Will Patton, one of the best character actors working in films today, has a small, but effective role. It'shame because he can outperform this cast by only saying his lines. Salma Hayek's Cora, the girl with a heart of gold, is a welcome presence for the eyes.The beginning of the film, as well as the closing scenes are the best things going because it sags a bit in the middle section, but all in all, it will keep the viewer entertained without pretending to be more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too bad...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, admittedly, is not the best of the genre but it is entertaining if you set aside the obvious parallels to films that came before. In fact, the script intentionally incorporates previous films by references from Dodge and Piper. The one at the end was hilarious!It could have been better in a few places and it certainly could have been worse. Better: have a little more animated performance from Baldwin, perhaps a little less gore and sadistic behavior by the Cubans and a bit more believability in the fire-fights. Kudos to Mr. Hooks for keeping it from becoming worse! My wife and I enjoyed watching this film and would recommend it to any free-thinking adults looking for a fairly good film to watch after the kids are in bed. Don't forget the popcorn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool, low budget chase movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with many movies, as long as the viewer doesn't read too much into the movie you will do OK! Its a fun fast paced road movie-ish, fugitive styled chase movie.It's well filmed, and slickly edited for a low budget chase flick.The acting is simply and solidly done even if the dialogue is a tad cheesy. Steven Baldwin is the token down at the heel hero, Laurence Fishburne is cool as the mentor type character, pulling the hero out of one fix after another. Salma Hayek is as stunning as ever but the best character is Gib played by Will Hatton, a highly likable character whos putting the puzzle together as the heros run around.Not a classic but worth a late night look see when you get home from the pub with a bag of munchies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The unlikeliest of partners, Laurence Fishburne and Stephen Baldwin are chained together and make a jail break together from a Georgia road gang. It's now the Nineties and objections about a black and white convict being chained together are now passé. Even with race not a really big issue with these two guys as it was in The Defiant Ones, they've still got a lot of other problems.The most curious thing about this is the interest the Feds have in this jailbreak. They're keeping the Atlanta PD cop who busted Baldwin in the loop, but at a distance and this arouses Will Patton's curiosity no end. US Marshal Robert John Burke is playing things way too close to the vest to suit Patton.Baldwin's who they're after. He's a computer hacker who hacked into a holding company that the Cuban Mafia owns and ripped off 25 million dollars. The local Cuban don, Michael Nader, wants him real bad. The wild thing in this film is that he's the only one in the cast who is what he says he is.A couple of current beauties, Selma Hayek and Brittany Powell, decorate this film as love interests for both Fisburne and Baldwin. Hayek is introduced rather clumsily into the situation that our escapees find themselves in.In fact the film, enjoyable though it is in many places, could have been a lot better with a much tighter script. Director Kevin Hooks did a good job with what he was given. In fact Kevin Hooks got to cast his dad Robert Hooks in a role as the Atlanta PD supervisor for Patton.Fled is not a bad film, it could have used a lot of improvement though in the writing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildly entertaining movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a mildly entertaining movie. Laurence Fishburne was in his prime as a taciturn action figure. Stephen Baldwin was adequate, quite an accomplishment for any of the Baldwin brothers not named Alec. Salma Hayek was awfully gorgeous back then, and one can see why she has had quite a career since then. And kudos to Brittney Powell in a small role. We have to mention Will Patton as well, in a role badly underutilized. There were decent production values, unobtrusive direction, nice photography of the Atlanta area. But overall, this film missed the mark, largely due to an uninspired script. Can't recommend it, but it isn't terrible either</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dodge is a computer hacker serving a prison term; Piper is a tough guy. They end up chained together, and flee during a chain-gang escape attempt that goes bad. An adventure plot ensues, involving a missing floppy disk, an attractive woman that assists them, a sinister Federal marshal, an honest cop, and the Cuban mafia....Sounded like a good idea at the time. Baldwin who was reasonably fresh from 'The Usual Suspects' and Larry 'I'll Change my name to Laurence' Fishburne, chained together and on the run, sounded like it could have been a good buddy movie with lots of one liners and good set pieces.It isn't i'm afraid. What you get is stereotypical characters coming and going, weak plot, and cheap production values, only made better by half decent performances from Patton And Fishbourne.It tries to be too clever for it's own good, with in jokes to films featuring cast members, and having silly twist after silly twist, making it just too boring come the end.If Hooks had watched a few cannon films from the eighties and focused on the action rather than the incomprehensible story, this would have been an amazing, funny if un-original action film.what we get is un-original and bored.Flee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsurprising but watchable action-adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wouldn't go so far as to call "Fled" a movie for idiots but it's definitely extremely unsurprising and basic action-adventure-thriller. Yes, even though it has some surprises that are obviously meant to be huge but I guess audience just waits that something "unexpected" happens. Nevertheless "Fled" is clearly a watchable movie. Laurence Fishburne is a splendid actor like "Boyz n the hood", "Othello" and "The Matrix" have proofed. I'm not a fan of Stephen Baldwin, the youngest one of Baldwin brothers but he makes an average performance in the other leading part. "Fled" is a gratifying try as a buddy movie and action flick. Standard from start to finish but if you're not expecting to see anything hugely miraculous I think you might just like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun film that pays tribute to other action films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course many people will say this movie was irrational and unoriginal, and truthfully, it was. But beside the lack of creativity, the film was actually a fun little action flick. The film is split into two main segments. The first part is a fugitive run away type chase that is somewhat entertaining. The 2nd takes part in the city that consists of many twists and "dramatic" deaths. Neither of these parts are amazingly great but they are both watchable. Fishburne is the stiff no nonsense character that he usually is and Baldwin is the rather silly but intelligent technical geek. The film, in my opinion, is somewhat of a homage to older action films and was worth a watch.Story 6/10 Action 7/10 Acting 6/10 Watchability 6/10 Total 6/10</fullReview>

Everyone from corrupt governmentagents to the Cuban mafia to even redneck thugs want them dead.Hey, there are at least two things that Piper and Dodge have incommon: They both have strong wills for survival and they don'ttake s*** from anybody.Fishburne and Baldwin make a great team, because theirbad-blooded chemisty with each other is hilarious. Theirbrooding personalities have sprinkles of funny humanity in them,and that's what makes their magic go boom. Plus, Will Pattonmakes a fine turn as the seemingly-dumb Southern cop named Gib,who might look retarded because of his redneckish way ofspeaking and his unkept looks, but his image is only skin-deep.Gib manages to find the solution to his problem, which alsobelonged to Pip</fullReview>

Mr. Baldwin please note only Brando and Dean could get away with the attitude and look you try to convey here. As for Mr Fishburne I have had enough of Black actors conveying that everyone in the world owes them. The original of this movie was the Defiant Ones with two great actors in Tony Curtis and Sydney Poitier and was a classic in story line and acting, this is BAD. There is a scene early in the movie where a good ole boy holds a shotgun on the two escaped convicts,but talks to them and does not shoot them.

		<shortDescription>One of Will Patton's best performances!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Patton is one of our finest actors, having blessed the screen with a variety of memorable characters. Unfortunately, most of his performances seem to be in movies like this: generic action films which nobody has any need to remember. Sure, he gets to show up in great movies (NO WAY OUT), good movies (REMEMBER THE TITANS), and popular movies (ARMAGEDDON), but the man is a working actor who ain't embraced by the masses, so he also has to make movies like this. Not that this is a painfully bad movie... it's just so darn generic. And the testament to the man's performance is that there is nothing on paper that should make this a particularly great role. But darn it if he isn't the moral center of the movie. If you don't know who this guy is, you can skip the movie with a clear conscience. But if you are a fan of the man, this performance is one of his best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watching it Causes a Paranormal Phenomenon !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>10 years ago I watched it. And it's clear that ever since it provokes the hell out of me continually; Bladwin's face hunts me in the nightmares, fear out of meeting it again while changing the channels, ..etc. I didn't have any intension to write a full review about it. Maybe because it doesn't worth it? Maybe I don't want to go through the horror once again ? Though, something pushed me to finally do it. Simply I discovered lately that I, unintentionally, handled it 3 times already (as you see the spirit of revenge is alive and eager !). It holds the record for being in 3 shame lists I edited before (they are all published in the IMDb's pages). You can find it in my lists of "1996's Top 10 Worst Comedies", "The Worst 10 Buddy-Movies" and "The Silliest 10 Buddies in Buddy-Movies" (guess who ?!). As you see all what I was trying to do is just warning my fellow humans who didn't watch it yet.It'll make you ask and ask : Is it a remake of (The Defiant Ones) ? Laurence Fishburne in a comic scenes ?!, Stephen Baldwin in a movie ?!!! I'll never forget a line was said by one of the evil characters while menacing someone "I'll make you wear your ass as a hat !" what was that anyway ??! Is it a hint about the makers of it as people think with their asses ?!I can't settle is it a crime action comedy, or a crime of action and comedy ?! It is B-grade B-movie with noisy episodes, TV-ish persona and unfunny everything. There are many references to many movies but it isn't a spoof or a respectable tribute inasmuch as a bad spoof of itself and shameful tribute. So it's poor man's The Defiant Ones, poor man's Lethal Weapon, and poor is the man who sat to watch it ! There is a big surprise about Fishburne's character at the very end, but you know what? The dumbness of the whole thing would force you to not buy it, or maybe to laugh at it ! Stephen Bladwin?? I think that they picked him for just being so white in front of Laurence Fishburne ! Now this is the way how Not to deliver comedy. Watching him trying to be comic will make you lose your temper. It is nice to act like a fool, giving a laugh out of that. But awfully Bladwin looks like a real fool ! And the interplay between him and Fishburne ?? Well, you can say that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde had better chance ! Originally, who the hell might think that Bladwin can do comedy (or else) ?Fishburne himself looked like something cooked hastily in boiling water, let's say looked like the movie itself (How Horrible !). He was acting uninterested, being not familiar with this kind of Hollywood's nonsense yet, or refusing it? Anyway, I hated whatever he delivered so much. He seemed provocative to the ultimate degree with a dull, rather dead, face all the time. So the true ridiculousness of the 2 leads plus the no-chemistry between them destroyed any possible chance for this movie to hit even the mark of "watchable". Speaking about actors, I think that I glimpsed accidentally Salma Hayic in here. She was sweet and cute as usual. Hmmm, I believe that in hard times we just dream of our dear ones ! Yes, I keep telling myself that she was a dream since my mind can't stand the possibility of "if she was really there", otherwise WHY THEY DIDN'T USE HER BETTER ???!!!In another planet that could have been funny and entertaining, with box office success and maybe Part 2! It's nothing but another cinematic interpretation of popcorn. It was only tasteless popcorn this time. The thing is it wanted to be fun, but obviously their makers weren't funny enough. To be fair, it can be so amusing yet for anyone wants to experience what the silly buddy-action comedy is all about. Still there is one great thing about it; the fact that Stephen Bladwin didn't return afterwards to be in any comic action again. Ahhh, a few things in this life can be right, soooo right ! If, after all of that, you're intent on watching it.. Then be aware, because I'm sure...you'd witness the weirdest thing, when you feel during all the viewing that you're wearing you're a** as a hat !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fled is the kind of a movie just should have been made with a tongue-in-cheek attitude to have been even a slight success. As it is, it's just too serious for it's own good. I mean, let's face it, Fled has to be the mother of all action movie clichés. This in mind, i find Dodge's constant references to masterpieces such as Deliverance and The Godfather kind of funny, and kind of sad. Admittably Hooks knows how to make your standard action movie, the action is good and the acting is solid. The dialogue is quite awful, but i'm assuming you know how to turn your brain off for a while to enjoy movies like this. I was hoping the bike scene would have been a bit longer, considering how badly the 4-5 (what i thought would have been the) final scenes dragged on. If you like action movies and you're having a free day with no plans, go for it! It's nice easy watching, don't let the rating (even though it's pretty dead on) stop you. I enjoyed it.</fullReview>

Congratulations!! You're a character from Fled. The plot keeps changing, but not in a good way, like L.A. Confidential. I'm talking like in a "oh, ok. so he's a cop, and he's a thief, but not a bad thief, and this cop guy is not a prisoner, but, um THIS SUCKS. etc. etc." frustrating, meaningless, stupid sort of way.

		<shortDescription>Laurence Fishburne and Stephen Baldwin escape and go on the moralistic tour.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not really too sure what to think of this movie. On the one hand it's a fast going action flick that is always on the movie and on the other hand it's a movie with a real muddled main plot that makes some odd choices with its characters and story elements.Here we have two tough convicts that escaped but are still friendly enough to save a little boy from being run over and they bring a man to the hospital who tried to shoot them but than got an heart attack in the process. There are some moralistic elements in the movie that seem highly out of place, especially when the main characters in the progress of the movie shoot around a lot without worrying too much about any innocent bystanders. It's such a ridicules contradicting contrast. it's just one of the story elements that makes "Fled" a pretty weak movie to watch.Also it's main plot line just never really seems to get off the ground. It's one of those stories you simply couldn't care less about and simply pay very little attention to it.Because of this also not all of the characters really work out in the movie. Actors such as Will Patton and Robert John Burke walk around in this movie but you can wonder why really. Their characters were potentially good ones but they simply got not used very well and only pop up once in a while, causing them to also make a pretty redundant impression.Laurence Fishburne is a fine actor and he really shows that in this movie. He gives away one fine performance, that alone still makes this movie still somewhat worthwhile. Stephen Baldwin is also not too bad in this movie and he forms a good duo with Fishburne.It's overall style also made the movie seem as if it was not to sure what it wanted to be. At times it showed the signs of a mismatched buddy comedy flick while at other times it was a pure violent action flick. So no, the movie also lacked a real clear consistent style, which also makes the viewer a bit uneasy on how to watch and approach the movie.It on the other hand is a fast going action in which basically always something is happening. No it's not always something good or interesting but at least it's not a slow or boring movie. It gives the movie definitely some watchable value. The action itself also isn't too bad and mostly consists out of shooting and a couple of chases. So no, also nothing too original here and it's a pretty formulaic standard action/thriller movie but it's definitely not the worst one around in its genre.A movie that definitely had some more potential in its core and could had worked out with a different and better approach of the overall story and character treatments. It still remains a somewhat watchable movie though thanks to it's principal actors and good action movie style of film-making.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did you know that the word "fugitive" derives from the Latin word meaning "flee"? Whether or not you do, it should be easy to figure out that "Fled" is almost a total repeat of "The Fugitive". It's another story of two guys chained together having to escape, all the while hating each other until they realize that they have to rely on each other; "The Defiant Ones" and "Runaway Train" did a much better job. This one, on the other hand, is basically a litany of car chases, explosions, etc. Laurence Fishburne has starred in far better movies, and even Stephen Baldwin appeared in "The Usual Suspects"; I can forgive Salma Hayek for starring in this, as it was early in her career.Anyway, it's not worth your time. Also starring Robert John Burke and Robert Hooks, and they probably don't wish to stress this in their resumes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jon Monsarrat review: Like "48 Hrs", OK but nothing special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love action films and think I know the genre fairly well. There's nothing bad about "Fled", it's just pretty uninspired.It reminds me of "48 Hrs", except Fled was made recently so doesn't have as much of an excuse.Lots of running around, flat characters. OK if you have nothing better to do on a rainy day. If you're desperate for something to follow up "The Fugitive", I suggest "U.S. Marshalls" which is a wink-wink non-sequel.Who should see this film:-- action buffs only, and then only if you've nothing better to doLike other reviewers, I give this film a 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie for idiots.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is quite possibly one of the WORST movies I have ever seen. The plot makes no sense whatsoever, and Fishbourne's constant "lets fled" is not only gramatically incorrect, it is also annoying. Watch this movie only if you enjoy idiotic mindless movies that have no consistency whatsoever. The only positive thing going for the movie are a handful of well-known actors/actresses, none of whom shine in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie obviously sucks.An excerpt from Army of Darkness: "ASH'S CHAINSAW ARM 149 comes up, over the edge of the pit. Followed by... THUMP! Ash's bloody hand. Then his bruised face. Covered in the black blood of the Deadites. He crawls to his feet.Ash tuns to the crowd, his list clenched.ASH All right now. Who wants to be next? Who wants some.150 GOLD TOOTH 150 look at Ash stupidly. Ash shoves him.ASH You want some more? Huh?! ASH This is my boomstick. It's a twelve gauge, double barreled Remington pump. Next one of you primitives touch me..."</fullReview>
