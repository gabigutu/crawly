		<shortDescription>Covers A Lot Of Ground</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Stanley Kramer classic covers a lot of ground -- literally and figuratively. Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier are white and black inmates who, while chained together at the wrist, escape their captors when their prison truck hits the ditch. Now Curtis is forced to put aside his prejudice and work with his new partner in getting the cuffs off and ensuring their newfound freedom lasts.As its reputation suggests, THE DEFIANT ONES is first and foremost a study of racism. It has a deliberate unpleasantness about it as it brings to life the unsavory attitudes of the past. A young boy who stumbles across the convicts races to the arms of Curtis for fear Poitier will hurt him. A lonely farm wife who takes the men in has to be told that yes, Poitier deserves a meal, too. And as the men face hanging at the hands of some rednecks, Curtis appeals to them on the grounds a white man can't be lynched. Yet the film carries no tired, moralistic messages, instead allowing the racism on display to speak for itself.THE DEFIANT ONES goes well beyond its central theme. It's an exciting adventure, along the lines of THE FUGITIVE, as our anti-heroes elude their captors and try to survive in the unforgiving wilderness. It's a story of raw human emotions at work and of overcoming adversity by putting our trust in others. And it's a story of loyalty and the capacity of the human heart to change. We come away with the sense that the people involved with this picture knew they were part of something truly special.Though he was given second billing, Poitier easily steals the show with his dignified performance. He brilliantly conveys the tortured, yet still upbeat soul of a young black man who came of age in a time of unimaginable difficulty. He often doesn't have to speak to let us know the pain he has and will continue to endure. Poitier proves that critics aren't just being kind when they cite him as one of the great black actors of his or any other era (though as we see here, he is definitely no singer!).THE DEFIANT ONES moves just a touch slow at times, particularly when the focus is placed on Curtis. But this is a movie as important as it is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Poitier/Curtis Jail-Break Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Poitier continues to break race barriers with this formula jail-break drama. Teamed with Tony Curtis, the escaped prisoners encounter many situations, where their difference in color seems to matter more than the fact that both are fugitives from the law. Throughout the film, the viewer empathizes with the escapees, figuring that they always got a bum deal in life. A scene towards the end, where a single mother sees a chance to "hook up" with Curtis, shows how Curtis, although often disagreeing, even physically fighting with Poitier, still sees Poitier as an equal in their quest for freedom. Rather than "sell out" his friend, he would rather die trying to save him. The inevidable ending (remember that one of the rules in Old Hollywood was that the bad guys can never win)is quite moving.Definitely among the established Hollywood Classics. Although many of the "old ways" have changed drastically since the late 50s, this film offers insight into a piece of Americana many people living today can still recall. An important piece of Film History, and highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great job by Stanley Kramer on this film. Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier turn in stellar performances as two convicts who get an unexpected shot at escape but are held together by a length of chain. They must learn to overcome their racial dislike of each other in order to survive and gain their freedom. But will they? The film is shot in black and white and had it been shot in color it would not have been as good. A remake was done some years later which was passable but didn't match this original version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this film several times and each time I am feeling that this is one of the best drama I've ever seen. There are new remakes of this film, but the original is the best. Acting of Sidney Poitier is without any doubt superb, while Tony Curtis did also his best. The director, Stanley Kramer, chose a very good and interesting plot, how two different persons can have better relationship and interests when they fight together for their lives. No matter if one is black and the other white, or no matter if one is atheist and the other Christian, at the end they will understand each other because their cause is only one and is the same, to become free.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is this story going around that Robert Mitchum refused the part Tony Curtis eventually played because he did not want to work with a black man. The actual story is that Mitchum who did spend time on a southern chain gang said there was no way that back in the day a black and white man would have been chained together in the first place. In fact Stanley Kramer must have taken the critique in stride because sheriff Theodore Bikel has a line of explanation saying the warden had a sense of humor.Though the film dates a bit, it's still quite dramatic even now. Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier chained together have an unplanned jail break while being transported. Curtis has all the attitudes typical of his time and Poitier doesn't take nothing off anybody. Still joined at the hip as they are, they do need each other and find eventually there's more that unites than divides them.Besides Theodore Bikel in a strange role for him as a laconic southern sheriff, look for good performances from Lon Chaney, Jr. who runs a turpentine work camp who saves Curtis and Poitier from a lynching and Cara Williams as a trampy white trash farm lady whose needs haven't been met for a while.Tony Curtis in an incredible act of generosity insisted on equal billing for Sidney Poitier since due to the nature of the film, they are on screen together for most of it. That act of generosity may have cost him an Oscar for both he and Poitier were nominated for Best Actor, but lost to David Niven for Separate Tables. An act that rankles Tony Curtis to this day because at the drop of a hat he will insist Niven got 'his' Oscar.Despite the sour grapes, The Defiant Ones though dated is still a good bit of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie on Racism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kramer's story about to escaped prisoners hooked up together, black and white, is still the best picture ever made on racism. At first they hate each other, but through their run for freedom they even become true friends and the different color of their skins actually disappears and they are just to men who like each other. Sidney Poitier is good as always and Tony Curtis gives what is probably his best performance ever in drama, matched only by his acting in The Boston Strangler later in 1967. The supporting cast is also good and correctly chosen. Although real action scenes are just a few, Kramer manages to keep attention permanently for viewers along with an increasing interest in how things turn out. Time has not affected the film which still stands as a big one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well directed outing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film very entertaining, thanks in part from great performances by both Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis, and due to great directing by Stanley Kramer. The black and white cinematography is great, as is the story of a black man and a white man, chained together and on the run from the law, who hate each other more than captivity itself. Shared experiences and the realization that inside they are both very similar helps both men to understand each other. I also liked the friction between the gung-ho sheriff and the more laid-back, realistic one. The character of the bloodhound owner rings true to anyone who knows a person who breeds dogs. The only thing I didn't like about this film was the Poitier character's singing. I know thats its a big part of the film and it is a form of defiance on its own, but it bugged me none the less. Oh well, small criticism for a great film. But what's with woman who'll sell out her son to some guy who stumbles into her yard? Wrong priorities, I guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The title speaks for itself. *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This great film follows two escaped convicts (Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier) as they try to out run the law. The problem is that both men are chained together. The bigger problem is that one is a white southern man and the other is a black man. The viewers know that by the time the police find them, the two men may have already killed each other.The two men form a bond with each other along the way. Each man tells their story and the other one listens. They reluctantly become friends as they go through woods, rivers, and clay pits to get to the train that leads out of town.The two come across a house where a woman (Cara Williams) and her son are living. When they get there, they break the chain that has held them together all this time. They stay the night in the house and when Poitier falls asleep, Williams takes a liking to Curtis. In the morning, the two love birds plan to escape in a car while Poitier has to run through a swamp to get to the train.Curtis discovers that it's a trap and runs to help Poitier. They find each other and get to the train where Poitier jumps on and reaches out to Curtis, who can't make it on to the train. Poitier realizes this and jumps off. The two fall down a hill and are captured by the police (Theodore Bikel and Charles McGraw.)This film is a great one. It's a must see film for anyone who likes gritty action. The performances are top notch and the editing is flawless. And the story and cinematography won oscars. Truly a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Escape from the chain gang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kramer was a Hollywood producer who turned into a director. He shows he had a promise when he undertook the direction of this production that involved race relations in the America of the 1950s, where segregation was still in place. To even set the story in the Deep South, as he did here, shows that Kramer was clearly not afraid of whatever repercussions the movie would get, or the problems associated for showing this situation to wide audiences.Basically, this is the story of two men who are shackled together, one white, one black, as they are being transported to a forced labor camp. When their bus suffers an accident, Joker, the white man, and Noah, the black one, see it as their opportunity to escape. There is one problems though, they can't get the chain that binds their wrists to be cut, however much they try.The sheriff of the place where the accident happens, quickly organizes a manhunt throughout the area. It will be only a matter of time when these two convicts will be caught. What starts as two men trying to avoid being captured, turns out into a sort of friendship between Joker and Noah. Joker, will never accept Noah, and vice versa, but they must stick together if they want to survive.Tony Curtis, who up to this point in his career, had only been given light roles to play, is the unexpected surprise of the film. In fact, this is one of the best roles he ever played in the movies, bar none. Sidney Poitier, on the other hand, plays against type in the movies. We always saw him as the decent black man who was a noble creature and wasn't appreciated. In this film, none of those qualities are shown by his character, who must deal with the burden of having to drag Joker along at the same time he is trying to save his own skin.The supporting cast made an excellent contribution to Mr. Kramer's direction. The excellent Theodore Bikel played Sheriff Max Muller with conviction. Charles McGraw, Leon Chaney Jr., Claude Akins, and Cora Williams contribute to make this film better than it could have been.The brilliant black and white photography by Sam Leavitt enhanced the film. Stanley Kramer deserved credit for bringing this story into the screen at a time when no one was doing anything as daring as what he did.</fullReview>

In the finest role of his career, Curtis shines especially as the man forced to fight for survival, not only from the law, but from Poitier, who is his enemy simply because of the color of his screen. Through their fight for survival, an unlikely kinship develops. Bikel and Williams are also wonderful in key supporting roles, as is Lon Chaney Jr.</fullReview>

Chained together, they must get along to survive and conquer the racial prejudices that divide them so.Both actors received best actor nominations. For both being nominated, David Niven was given a gift that year of the best actor award for Separate Tables.Comedienne Cara Williams shines as a woman they meet while on the lamb. While her part is brief, Williams is gritty and was nominated for best supporting actress as well as sheriff Theodore Bikel, in the supporting category as well.

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable Anti-Racism Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the truck that is transporting convicts has an accident on the road, the inmates John "Joker" Jackson (Tony Curtis) and Noah Cullen (Sidney Poitier) that are chained to each other escape. They hate each other but they need to help each other to succeed in their intent of going north to jump in a train and reach freedom. Meanwhile the humane Sheriff Max Muller (Theodore Bikel) organizes a posse to track them down in a civilized manner and respecting justice. Joker and Cullen reach a small farm where a lonely woman helps them to get rid of their chains. She offers to driver her car with Joker and her son Billy while Cullen would escape through the swamp to the railroad. But when Joker learns that she sent Cullen to a trap, he leaves her and is shot in the shoulder by Billy. Joker seeks out Cullen to save him and when they meet each other, their former hatred has changed to friendship and respect. "The Defiant Ones" is an unforgettable anti-racism classic when the United States were openly racist. Stanley Kramer is responsible for two of the best anti-racism movies, "The Defiant Ones" and "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner", both with Sidney Poitier. Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier have memorable performances. I would like to know how the reception of this movie from the audiences in 1958 was. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Acorrentados" ("Chained")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Proof that Stanley Kramer's decision to idealise the Sidney Poitier character in "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" was a conscious, thought-out move (some would say it was a mistake for all that, but that's another matter), and not a cowardly or patronising one. Poitier's convict here has streaks of nobility - Curtis's does too - but the aggression for which he was jailed is real enough.For the first half, everything is firmly screwed in place: the black and the white convict chained together, the local volunteers tracking them down, the humane sheriff trying to keep his forces in check. Things started to shake themselves loose when the woman makes an entrance. The story had worked well so long as the two convicts were estranged from civilisation, with only each other to fall back on, and it might have continued to work, if the woman had been interesting in some other way than as a plot device. In fact things got better again as soon as she vanished from the screen.Solid and intelligent, but the other well-known Kramer films, considered as films, are better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Chain as a symbol of brotherhood in adversity and the key for tolerance and mutual respect ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Defiant Ones" was retitled in French, "The Chain", as if the real issue was the relationship between John "Joker" Jackson and Noah Cullen, Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier as two fugitives from a chain gang, a white and a black man shackled together and forced to cooperate and trust each other in order to survive. The chain would become such a symbol that during Sidney Poitier's AFI Lifetime Achievement Award, Curtis asked him to lift his left hand, he did the same, and suddenly, we could almost see the chain magically reappears as the symbol of this brotherly bond that transcends the color of the skin. But I guess "The Defiant Ones" resonates as a more complex and thought-provoking title, because it doesn't rely on the obvious, but rather on the two character's resentful attitudes, that visually fits the beautiful black and white cinematography. Both have accumulated anger and frustration all their lives, Jackson is tired of being an average nobody saying "thanks" to the big shots to get more money, while Cullen as a black man from the South, is tired of "being nice" and being called "boy" and swallowing his pride in moments where a nice punch on the face is tickling his hand. As prisoners, both incarnate the same consequence to two different kinds of exclusions: by class and by races Yet their escape is not meant to inspire our sympathy or to portray them as two unfortunate individuals victims of circumstances. "The Defiant Ones" is a powerful social commentary about the way America is viewed from the very bottom and how the vision encourages criminal vocations by perverting what could be a stimulating legitimate desire for revenge. But the movie avoids the kind of patronizing preaches ? la 'Atticus Finch', the script is surprisingly modern in its tone, reminding of the New Hollywood independent wave of the 70's. Take the sheriff, played by Theodore Bikel, he's not your typical racist bigot, but a professional man assigned to get the prisoners, and no one in his team is portrayed as a cold-blooded killer either.The only bit of fantasy is the idea of a chain between a black and white man: "the warden had a sense of humor", they say, maybe he thought that in a case of an escape, the toughest prisoners would end up killing each other anyway. Even if the explanation doesn't convince some purists, seriously, I'm glad the writers didn't abandon such a great premise for the sake of realism; the film is still a drama but not a documentary. Yet, there is something sincere and truthful in Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier's performances. Curtis makes it hard to believe that he'd be Daphne in "Some Like it Hot", and Poitier exudes a tough coolness that contrasts with the elegant and soft-spoken roles of the 60's, and I could never resist to his "bowling green, sewing machine", the blues song that helps him to keep a good spirit in hopeless situations.Whether by singing, grunting, or fighting, the defiant attitude has its limits, because the success of the escape only depend on cooperation. Yet the film trusts its material enough not to jump into inspirational conclusions quickly. When they cross the river, Cullen thanks Jackson for having pulled him out of the water, Jackson rectifies: he prevented himself to drown. Their solidarity is only built on survival instinct, like when they successfully get out of a pool of mud. They're confronted to a new situation when they break into a small town's grocery store, to get food and tools and risk a lynching. Curtis tries to reason the men, but when it gets desperate, he invokes his whiteness (the look Poitier gives him at that moment is a killer). Cullen knows it's over and doesn't hesitate to spit on the guy who teases him, even if it got him a slap in the face.The mob's depiction is compensated by the intervention of 'Big' Sam, Lon Chaney Jr. as a former chain prisoner who frees them in the morning. The journey goes on, when after an ultimate fight, they end up in the house of a single mother living with her son. The two prisoners finally get rid of the chain and the morning after, they finally take different directions. Before taking the car with his new woman, Jackson learns that she gave Cullen wrong indications using him as a bait. Jackson leaves her in a state of rage that earns him a bullet in the process. Only Jackson and Cullen could see how similar they were, how brothers they became in the same fight. And it's out of respect, earned the hard way, that Jackson goes to Cullen.The two men reunite in the swamp, and hearing the train whistles and the dog coming after them, they run for the most emblematic moment of the film. Cullen hops in the freight train but is incapable to drag Jackson aboard. In recognition of Jackson's previous gesture, Cullen sacrifices his only chance of freedom by jumping and both tumble to the ground as if they still had a chain. They're exhausted physically, but their spirit is as high as it never was, they can only wait for the police to come after them. When the sheriff finds them, Cullen sings his song, while Jackson in his arms, about to pass out, smiles at him. The chase is over, but it's not an unhappy ending, the three men are smiling, and Poitier concludes: "bowling green, sewing machine"It's only by defying their own selfishness and racial boundaries, that the defiant ones gained in humanity at the price of freedom. And when Poitier raises his hand, asking Curtis to join him as if they were still shackled, they've never been as shackled as when they didn't have the chain, and maybe that's the key of tolerance, to act as if we were all chained to each other.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful drama brought to us by Stanley Kramer as black and white prison escapees are forced to evaluate each other due to the seemingly unbreakable chain that binds then together whilst on the run. Coming as it did back in 1958 you really need to think about the time frame to appreciate the message of the movie and the underlying racial tension that drives the film. The film couples its race relations message with a poke in the ribs to the penal system and Kramer manages to capture the stifling nature of both topics with much success.The academy awarded gongs for Best Story {screenplay} and Best B/W Cinematography, and both were richly deserved, especially the gorgeous work that Sam Leavitt did with the lush B/W. Both Poitier &amp; Curtis were nominated for their respective roles and in the case of Curtis his portrayal of an ignorant Southerner is quality personified.A cracking film saying much and delivering in equal measure, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A tight and tense drama about two escaped convicts from a southern chain gang. Well, actually they're still chained together at the wrist, which makes them a gang of two now. The situation leads to all kinds of circumstances, which director Stanley Kramer took good advantage of making for numerous exciting scenes. One man is white (Tony Curtis) and the other is black (Sydney Poitier). The chain is both a symbol of oppression and unity. The film cuts in both ways, and at the end they're both victims of a twisted system of justice circa Paul Muni in I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang. The ending could have been much more impacted than it was. They only hinted at how dangerous the lonely woman and her son , who turns out to be a pretty good shot, were. Both Curtis and Poitier are excellent, the photography is some of the best b&amp;w ever, and the entire scene in the turpentine camp with Claude Akins and Lon Chaney Jr. is simply riveting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven but effective chase drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possibly Stanley Kramer's most famous directorial entry, THE DEFIANT ONES is the story of "Joker" Jackson (Tony Curtis) and Noah Cullen (Sidney Poitier), two tough-as-nails convicts who are accidentally freed when the truck that transports them overturns. But they are not freed from each other, for they are linked at the wrist by a two-foot chain. Now Jackson, a redneck white racist, and Cullen, a bitter and resentful black man from a poverty-stricken family, must cooperate if they are to escape. There is a subplot that follows the sheriff's posse pursuing them, but it is poorly developed and serves mostly to slow the movie down.THE DEFIANT ONES gets its strength from the study of the two leads' changing characters. Sidney Poitier's bravura performance as Cullen earned him a well-deserved Best Actor nomination. Cullen is no saint, but his resentment comes across as heartfelt, never as whining. Poitier's timing is superb; at one point he breaks out laughing at Jackson's fumbling efforts to ignore him at the exact same instant that I did. I am not a fan of Tony Curtis, and he is frequently guilty of overacting here, but he undeniably sparks excellent chemistry with Poitier, and with Cara Williams also (the lonely abandoned wife with whom the two fugitives take shelter). The two-foot steel chain will stand alongside the Maltese Falcon and the One Ring as the best plot devices in cinematic history. It is fascinating to watch a link of respect and mutual reliance grow between the two men, more durable than the physical link. The best line in the movie, now unjustly forgotten, comes after the chain has been removed. Cullen raises his bare wrist and encourages the injured Jackson: "Come on, Joker, you' draggin' on the chain!"Samuel Leavitt won a merited Oscar for his sharp, glowing cinematography. Jacob Smith's and blacklisted Nedrick Young's screenplay also won an Oscar, but that choice is more questionable; for every good line there is an artificial-sounding clunker, and one of the climactic plot twists is painfully predictable. But they do deserve credit for their ending, which is warm and yet completely avoids the feel-good Hollywood denouement that I was expecting. The supporting cast's attempts at Southern accents uniformly stink; the only standout is Lon Chaney, Jr. as a compassionate ex-convict.There is much to dislike about the DEFIANT ONES, but much more to like. Kramer did well with this movie, but he did better on his lesser-known efforts JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG and INHERIT THE WIND.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Ridiculous Melodrama That Has Dated Very Badly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never seen THE DEFIANT ONES and I sat down to watch it a couple of days ago in eager anticipation since this was regarded as a classic American movie from the 1950s , I mean we're talking about the movie with " the white convict and the black convict handcuffed and on the run " . After seeing it I thought perhaps the critical acclaim was to do with the TVM remake that starred Robert Urich because this is a film so melodramatic and dated that any cynical audience member will either fall asleep through boredom or throw popcorn at the screen A truck carrying members of a chain gang crashes and a couple of convicts escape . The cops leading the hunt are shocked to discover that the authorities have in their infinite wisdom shackled a white guy to a black guy . You might have thought they might have been more surprised that considering the spectacular crash the two escapees manged to run away without a scratch between them The action cuts to the two felons on the run John " Joker " Jackson and Noah Cullen and just in case there's any blind people in the audience who haven't realised that Tony Curtis is white and Sidney Poitier is black they call each other all sorts of racist names . At this early point I knew instantly where the story was going so all the name calling seemed superfluous in the end and to be blunt I was never convinced that these characters would exist in reality , in fact I couldn't believe they were characters at all , just a couple of actors playing roles And as the story went on I realised I was getting battered over the head with the message " Racism is wrong and we should look beyond the colour of a persons skin in order to survive " . Thank you for pointing this out but I would have come to the same conclusion without it getting rammed down my throat . If the movie had been subtle then I would have regarded it better but that's the problem it's not a subtle movie at all - It's an often ridiculous melodrama best summed up by the ending which is both entirely predictable and laughably illogical</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kramer tribute to friendship.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Defiant Ones" is a very interesting and original film, where two fugitives, one white and one black, run away after dump truck prisoners. Throughout its long journey to escape, the morale of each and point of view of things will be tension and distrust for the other.Stanley Kramer aptly portrays those peoples and villages of the American Southwest, as evidenced by the scene where the protagonists are going to be lynched. Also notable is that friendship that develops between them to be chained, resulting in splendid dialogues."The Defiant Ones" is a great tribute to Kramer to equality, friendship and respect that develops between two men in a culture and opposing values. Although in principle, do so in a manner required since these are two prisoners (one white and one black) who flee chained for a transfer to prison. But this does not detract much less the message from the director. On the contrary, since it was initially very strong reflects the position of both characters and bias are shown with one another. But as they pass together the events and experiences can be seen a big change between them, leading to a great friendship and respect between them.All performances are remarkable, highlighting some inspired performances by Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier and the narrative is vibrant and intense. The film shows a masterly way, the defence intended to reflect anti-racist Kramer, concerned about racial and social problems of his country. It's a great message and great dialogue, so Kramer is not a coward; do not need rhetoric or marketing easy to talk about prejudices among different people and especially friendship.One of the three best films of the entire career of Stanley Kramer,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Race Relations in the 1950s South</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John 'Joker' Jackson (Tony Curtis, but looks like Joan Crawford) and Noah Cullen (Sidney Poitier) escape from a chain gang. They are pursued by Sheriff Max Muller (Theodore Bikel), but also must face the racism of the south, and the difficulty of putting up with a stranger you are handcuffed to.Also appearing is the sympathetic villager Big Sam (Lon Chaney Jr.) and lots of uncredited extras. The credits list about twelve people, but the cast is clearly closer to forty people. Most likely, they never amounted to anything anyway, though...This film was nominated for an Academy Award for pretty much every possible thing, but won for script and cinematography. As the film now sits at a 7.7 of 10 on IMDb, I have to wonder if 1958 was a slow year. This film was amazing, but did it deserve every nomination? Maybe, maybe not. I, for one, thought the actress in the leading female role was awful.Overall, a great film, with Poitier displaying a wide range of emotions. Tony Curtis was decent, too, but was clearly not the strong lead that Poitier was (and this seems to be widely accepted, as Poitier won a Berlin award but Curtis did not).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By all estimates, this was the film that put Sidney Poitier over the top. It was his first movie credit above the title, and along with fellow co-star Tony Curtis, both were nominated for the Best Actor Oscar that year. The funny thing is, and I thought this more than once, but Poitier didn't look like Poitier to me, even in his close-ups. It didn't seem to have anything to do with the chain or the prison duds, he just looked like a different person.Underdog films wind up being among my favorites. The action here gets underway within the first couple of minutes, and generally doesn't let up. I have to credit the film makers and the principals for that unreal clay pit segment, which literally looked impossible to get out of. There's no denying that the players earned their paycheck with this picture. The conditions were miserable and the situations Jackson (Curtis) and Cullen (Poitier) found themselves in were both physically and mentally demanding.Obviously, the subject of racism is at the center of the picture, as director Stanley Kramer made the bold decision to challenge the movie going public with a black and white, man to man relationship that was further compounded by their status as escaped convicts. Exploring each man's hatred for the other, while forcing them to remain closely chained together, was a daring way to challenge 1950's America to begin shaking off the inherent evils of racism. When Poitier's character actually slapped a white man in the face almost a decade later in "In The Heat Of The Night", it was as if his own career had come full circle to the point where a white American could stand up and cheer against bigotry and intolerance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two prisoners, one black (Sidney Poitier) and one white (Tony Curtis), escape after they've been shackled together by the wrists. They are pursued by a posse led by Sheriff Theodore Bikel. After several adventures they are captured.The plot is sketched out schematically. Every scene makes its point, then we move on to the next scene, which makes ITS point, until the two men are lying exhausted next to the railroad tracks and resigned to their recapture, Curtis still resentful, Poitier defiantly cheerful, both doomed.The point of the film -- and I hate to say this -- is that we are all brothers under the skin, shackled together by our common humanity, not to mention our physicality.The plot is tightly wound and the points spelled out so that they can't be easily missed -- like "Stagecoach" or "High Noon." Nothing and nobody is in the least bit ambiguous or quirky. There's the humane sheriff, the rabid redneck crowd, the bitter inmates, the horny widow, the suspicious kid, and so forth.I'd consider that a weakness, but it's made up for by the depth given to some of the characters. They may be stereotypes but they're pretty hominid after all. Take that horny widow, for instance. Here she is, isolated in a ramshackle house in some Southern state, deserted by her husband, left with a kid who shoots rabbits for meals. She's shallow, selfish, and something of a racist. Yet she seems attracted enough to Tony Curtis, despite his phony nose, to give up everything, gather her dollars together, and run away with him. It's an invitation to share her future. And there's no reason to believe she's especially fickle or that he's less than just an instrument to get her away from her stagnation -- although he IS an instrument. The widow needs a man to jump start her, and Curtis has done it. She's a complex person and ultimately kind of pathetic.The movie today would have been shot in the real South. As it is, it looks like California in the rainy season. Those granite rocks to which the pair cling as they make their way across that rushing river look distinctly as if they'd tumbled down from the Sierras, which they have. The little flakes of mica that scintillate under the California sun seem to be winking at us. Let's all pretend that this is the hinterland of Georgia or someplace. It doesn't kill the movie. It's just a distraction, as is the unbelievably formulaic lynch mob.Stanley Kramer directed this and, as usual, he's trying to teach us a lesson the way a teacher teaches the ABCs to a kindergarten class. It seems condescending to us now, fifty years after its release, but it was necessary for some of us in 1958. Maybe the lesson is still relevant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Workmanlike, but highly effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arguably director Stanley Krammer's only true moment of cinematic greatness, THE DEFIANT ONES is a film that takes a standard plot (two convicts, who hate each other, escape but are chained together and must learn to depend upon one another) and manages to pack an extremely powerful punch. It was a surprise in 1958 to see Tony Curtis in a dramatic role, and he used the part to showcase what a versatile actor he was. Today, it is Poitier's performance that is much more surprising.Being so use to his "enlightened gentleman" roles of the late sixties, it is quite a shock to see him be totally believable as a tough, undereducated felon. Both men were justifiable nominated for Best Actor Oscars. Nathan E. Douglas' screenplay dodges cliché and contains still-believable dialogue. The gorgeous black and white cinematography is only one more merit to a terrific film.</fullReview>

It's just a shame that the only DVD apparently available(?) of this film is devoid of any extra features, especially commentary by Poitier and Curtis or Bikel which would prove fascinating. In 2008, when the film celebrates its 50th year there should be a fully loaded DVD commensurate with the picture's value.Terrific acting and writing, virtually low-key and underplayed compared to most hyperbolic American cinema today. What's amusing. but also a bit too distracting however, is the plot hole which has our escapees smoking cigarettes just minutes after they were totally submerged and soaked crossing a raging river. No way they would have had any dry matches and smokes! But hey, that's just that whole nutty, wacky, crazy chain gang thang going on...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brave but over-earnest allegory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film very much of its time, which I don't think personally has aged too well, although it still makes for some interesting and occasionally involving viewing. The writing of the movie is very much in the shadow of Steinbeck and Tennessee Williams, against the background of the burgeoning Civil Rights movement in America at the time, but for me, it buckles under the weight of its own over-earnest good intentions, despite the considerable efforts of both cast and crew.I was surprised to learn that the screenplay wasn't adapted originally from a play, given the amount of static movement in the film coupled with a lot of speechifying. I also just couldn't get my head round the premise of two racially different felons just happening to be chained together and finding themselves on the run together in the Southern States, all the film's gritty realism scuppered for the sake of allegory.There's still a lot to savour, the cinematography is excellent in its near-documentary realism, while the two leads throw themselves unstintingly into very exacting physical parts. I like both Curtis and Poitier but wasn't completely convinced by their respective performances, Curtis's accent comes and goes and you can see him straining to act seriously in the first half of the film - however he improves as the film progresses and ultimately convinces by the ending. Poitier is again forced to adopt a degree of racial stereotyping, notably his crooning of the plantation-type song, but his acting is more consistent than Curtis and for me, more enjoyable. However as stated above the idea that these two, the racially prejudiced Curtis and the proud Negro Poitier could get along for more than five minutes, never mind pour out their collective hearts along the way as they get all philosophical and universal on us, is too much to swallow.In support, Cara Williams is fine as the abandoned country wife, desperate for love and a future with Curtis (there's an excellent dissolve shot as their relationship is consummated) but what a difference it would have made to the dynamics of the film if she had fallen for Poitier instead - not, of course that such a storyline film could ever have been green-lighted at the time, while Theodore Bikel is excellent as the pursuing sheriff who retains his humanity, refusing to bow to the pressure of his posse to bring the wanted duo back more dead than alive. The petty squabbling of the pursuing pack, together with the lynch-mob mentality of a small outpost where the convicts are caught seeking food are obviously thrown up as contrast to the developing get-along relationship between the escapees, but as I indicated it was shown in too sharp relief.Certainly a worthy and well-meaning film but too unbelievable and portentous to really hit home, at least with me.</fullReview>

With the sheriffs hard on their trail, Cullen and Jackson find that there mutual dislike for each other is only one of the obstacles between them and freedom.I have seen this film before and had memories of it as a classic of sorts. However a very well known black n' white film with two big stars shouldn't be seen as a classic simply on those merits and I must admit that my memory had tricked me as this wasn't a great film. The plot had potential but it focuses too much on the bigger metaphor rather than the story unfolding there and then. As a result, chases through swamps lack tension as the film wants to make the wider point of the `black experience' or how blacks and whites need to get on etc. At the time it must have been brave and a point that needed making (it probably still is an important point) but now it just feels like the film has been chained to a heavy partner that slows it down.Part of me felt that maybe the director wanted to labour his message so that everyone got it, another part of me felt that he should have trusted his audience and not rammed it down our throats at nearly every step.Tony Curtis is pretty good. In some scenes he is given a bad hand to work with, but he is certainly a lot better an actor here than his current `spoof of himself' appearances would suggest. Poitier can't sing, but he does act with passion and makes his character more than `a black man' which was very important to the film. Their bickering seems to switch quite easily and their redemption is perhaps a little unlikely in it's degree.Overall it is worth seeing as it is an OK film but the message is delivered in a very heavy fashion that really takes a lot more away from the film than it adds. The pace and energy of the opening 30 minutes is lost to heavier scenes that deliver `the message' and then very talky scenes ? the `point' could easily have been made within the film rather than expanding and taking it over to it's detriment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Defying Prejudice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chained together, two prison escapees (one Caucasian; the other African-American) have to learn to overcome racial prejudice to successfully flee together in this emotionally charged drama from Stanley Kramer. The film was considered quite important in its day for its advocating of racial tolerance - winning an Academy Award for its screenplay and the Golden Globe for Best Picture no less - however, it is questionable how much impact the film would have on contemporary viewers today. Certainly, the acting is great, with both leads in fine form and allowed the opportunity to soliloquise their thoughts and dreams. The stark black and white photography (which won the film a second Oscar) is excellent too with several remarkable nighttime shots. There is a particularly great bit in which the two leads are tied up on opposite ends of a pole and the camera creeps back and forth between them. As a narrative though, the film is shaky at best. The constant cutting between the prisoners on the run and the policemen tracking them down adds little to the film and often provides an unwelcome break in the tension mounting between the prisoners. The characters' trajectories from intolerance to acceptance are also obvious from the get-go and the film is never particularly subtle with its messages. The symbolism of the pair being chained together is especially too obvious to be effective. All the events in the film do, however, spiral towards an admittedly potent final few minutes in which we truly see how much the characters have transformed for their experiences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Defiant Ones" gave me a whole lot more than I had expected. I always had thought this was a semi-sensational action film that exploited racism to attract notoriety. It actually is a poignant story of two men on the run who must cooperate in spite of their mutual animosity. The original screenplay by Nedrick Young and Harold Jacob Smith won the Oscar for 1958, and I am hard-pressed to think of a script more deserving of every accolade possible. Joker Jackson (Tony Curtis, a revelation) and Noah Cullen (Sidney Poitier, fierce and fatalistic) are chained together and are in flight from a posse of local deputies led by Sheriff Max Muller (Theodore Bikel) and State Trooper Capt. Frank Gibbons (Charles McGraw). The ongoing quarrels between the two pairs of mismatched partners throughout the film paints a vivid picture of life in the rural South of the 1950s. Bikel is simply stunning in his offhand performance as the humanitarian leader of the manhunt, and McGraw is unyielding in his determination to bring in the escapees swiftly and by any means necessary. Claude Akins is intimidating in a small role as the inhabitant of a work camp the prisoners stumble across. Lon Chaney Jr. dominates the screen during this passage, as we learn that he has good reason to empathize with Joker and Cullen (as Curtis calls Poitier). The duo ultimately seek refuge at the modest farm of an unnamed and abandoned single mother and her child. This portion of the film becomes a vignette straight out of a Tennessee Williams play, and the heat radiating from Cara Williams could warm an entire Arctic outpost.I cannot stress enough how fine the acting is by the entire cast. I have never seen Tony Curtis do such good work, and Poitier is excellent as always, with a a haunting mix of melancholy and mirth that is best displayed by his boisterous rendition of William C. Handy folk song "Long Gone" at key points in the movie. Cara Williams is riveting every second she is on screen, and Lon Chaney Jr. acts as a counterbalance to the casual prejudice of the other Caucasian characters. The various Southern accents are underplayed but lend authenticity to the dialogue, as do sundry colloquialisms they use. Stanley Kramer, a well-known social activist, directs the film without judgement, as the actions of the players speak for themselves. I cannot find a single flaw in "The Defiant Ones", and I have no choice but to give it the Highest Recommendation possible."I fill it up wit' dreams."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a perfect film. Deep with poetic subtlety. It won best screenplay and best cinematography at the 1958 Oscars. The story is effortlessly vital. Sidney Poitier's performance is incredible. There are no words to describe it. He expresses himself meaningfully through small gestures. I also like this side of Tony Curtis. He keeps an echo of his trademark charm while showing the ruggedness and skepticism of a convict. There's even a small vignette which relates the life of a 50s housewife to that of a prisoner. The cinematography is exceptional. The shots blend noir and American naturalism. Look out for the close up of Sydney and Tony's hands in the last scene. I must have rewound and watched it four times... Possibly the greatest ending to an American film. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John "Joker" Jackson (Tony Curtis), and Noah Cullen (excellent portrayal by Sidney Poitier), have escaped from prison and are shackled together. The story, well directed by message film director Stanley Kramer (see also the excellent "Ship of Fools", as well as his masterpiece "On The Beach" with Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner).At any rate, the film has some good scenes, they are in the brush and swamps of Georgia, trying to escape a pack of bloodhounds, and the Sheriff well portrayed by Theodore Bikel The fact that the way Poitier is treated , simply because he is black, is a time warp as when a woman offers the refugees food, but first asks Curtis if she "should give the other guy some as well". Tony Curtis is good in the role of a desperate malcontent, his accent a bit too NY but his acting usually overcomes this. He is angry at society, that he wants to be a "success". The dated phrase "Charlie Potatoes", humorously shows us the society of 1950's America and its values of what success means. Money, at any cost.The sheriff;s bounty hunter assistant has several bloodhounds and Dobermans "I hope you treat them dogs as go as your grandma" cracks Bikel. The dogs and how they are cared for (better than minorities and the poor) is a point of reference.Bikel as sheriff has a run in with Lon Chaney Jr., a man who lets the prisoners free from a town lynch mob. The seething anger and hypocrisies of small town America are well manifested here. Racism, ignorance, bigotry.This film was made in 1958, an important message. 10/0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>African Americans in American Culture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before anything else I wish to stipulate here, that this writing is non-partisan one and has nothing to do with any form of racism, communism or whatsoever deviant behavior - cf., "Defiant Ones" (1958) and also less prominent remake with Carl Weathers and Robert Urich in 1986. If Stanley Kramer dared to produce this movie in 1958 and Tony Curtis (White Male Caucasian) participate in principal leading role, subsequently I don't see reason to swell 60 years later when about half of Hollywood actors are colored and Film Industry in the making depend on this people. The reason I took this small undertaking is to try (if possible) to dispel the myth of African American Culture, its boundaries and genesis, and its role in interpreting current history of USA and all English speaking people on this planet Earth. It's a fair coin, I think both Blacks and Whites should understand me."The Defiant Ones" (1958), gave Sidney Poitier his first Academy Award nomination as Best Actor. Five years later, he won the Oscar for "Lilies of the Field" (1963), the first African American to win for a leading role. His roles in "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" (1967) and "To Sir, with Love" (1967) were for their time landmarks in the breaking down of social barriers between African Americans and Whites.I took the paragraph above as citation from IMDb. Certainly its a good place here to mention some other Black American film stars that I have remembered vividly in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s - Harry Belafonte, Jim Brown, Fred Williamson, Yaphet Kotto, James Earl Jones, Richard Pryor (died of dementia in 2005), Eddie Murphy, etc. Those were people that single-handedly could perform and produce a good Movie for the Big Audience. There are other names that I have missed maybe, but as a rule good Films in those times were the ones that were remembered. In the 1990s already African Americans in Hollywood Films became a cliché, there were so many nominations and deserved medleys that I am not in position right now to make an appreciation.I will go further a little bit. I am a self-conscious citizen and read all kind of literature (on equal opportunity). I have books in my library on Black Racism and White Racism, the way it started in the American Southwest from the years of 1860 and on. Mass Organizations such as Ku Klux Clan appeared as reaction on the loosing Confederate side. As counter reaction the free Black Americans left their cluster Southern States and migrated internally East and West all over USA. They started to study Culturally and Physically in High Schools and Universities. They interbreed freely in marriages with Whites and casted a singular alloy of racial unity - namely, Mulattos (if you can distinguish them physically) are as good as Blond or Brunette Whites. So what's the case here? Why are we still reading pieces of literature like "We Charge Genocide" (1951) by Civil Rights Congress on pages of Wikipaedia. It's high time for reconciliation ...</fullReview>

What makes it special is the well written banter between the two anti-heroes supported through Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier's great performances as they bond and fight. The struggle between them is fascinating, particularly in how the physical obstacles in front of them are written. This paralleled with the subplot of the authorities in their pursuit with their inter conflict makes the cat-and-mouse plot entertaining to watch. The Oscar-winning cinematography also helps bring a cinematic spark to some scenes to lift it from the occasional John Ford-esque stage sets. While it starts to slow down in pace in the third act, its beautiful full circle seals the deal. Great classic.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is unchained</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was defiant to watch this movie by Stanley Kramer. The movie is the story of two escaped convicts, African-American Noah Cullen (Sidney Poitier) who hates white people, and bigot white man, John 'Joker' Jackson (Tony Curtis), whom hates blacks. Both men find themselves both shackled to one another after surviving a prisoner transport car wreck. Seeing a way to escape, both men travel the back roads eluding posses, cops, and the law on their quest for freedom. Both actors were able to get down and dirty for the role, but literally as most of the scenes have them lying down in dirt, mud, and rain. They are at first on each other throat, fighting against each other, but for them to survive. They are forced to put their issues away. This is where the characters try to relied on each other. After camping out and hearing out each other stories, the mood between them soften. They are help on the way by supporting characters such as Big Sam (Lon Chaney Jr.). Lou Chaney Jr, the Hungarian actor is wonderful in the role, as he able to sport the Southern accent as well, able to play somebody that isn't trying to be sinister. Too bad, he doesn't have much screen time or much to bring to the story. Another character they met on the way is the lonely, love-hungry widow played by Cara Williams, who offers to turn in Cullen if Joker will stay with her. Cara Williams is so love struck by Tony Curtis's character, that it's seems out of the blue for her to help one stranger after one day spent with each other, but Cara Williams does a great act as a desperate woman looking for escape by any means even trying to hook up with a inmate. She can be pity and hatred when view. By the time the two men are within hailing distance of a train that might take them to freedom, they have become friends somehow. Despite its pedigree ? the film lacks screen time to explain more how the two main characters' antagonism will boil over and then cool into a forged friendship based on altruism and shared sacrifice. It's running time is only 97 minutes. Way too little for this character is suddenly become cool with each other. The whole film is way too short and focus on too long on cut aways with Sheriff Max Muller. (Theodore Meir Bikel) who was also nominated for the role, just doesn't give anything new to it. I also would love to hear some music score. The film lacks any music to give the movie any suspense, feeling or drama. It felt too good of a movie, not to have a film score. The ending will a downer, but it's works for the story. One of the biggest complains in the film is that some critics stated out that Sidney's character is a 'Magical Negro'. I don't see that at all, as Joker first come in the aid to Cullen when Cullen is stuck in the swamp, as well as having back story. Nor does Sidney character gives anything special insight to change Joker. It was the outside world and the supporting characters that change Joker. The scene where Sidney Poitier comforts Tony Curtis by holding his head in his arms is not made to look like Poitier's character was a servant to the the white man, at all. He did that to comfort his friend. The movie shows that Black or white we are all equal before the harshness of life. The movie is a good movie for teaching civil rights and racial tolerance. I think the theme of racism better and even more obvious in the foreground to make time this was filmed deliberately black-and-white. The movie is pretty gutsy for its era. It's a good watch, so check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The time of extreme racism has long gone, but this chained-together white and black convicts' escaping adventure simply hasn't waned much for its in-your-face impact of genuine thrill and sympathy, director Stanley Kramer's (from SHIP OF FOOLS 1965, 6/10) third feature, gathering Curtis and Poitier as the "impossible pair", the film would successfully pave the way for Poitier and Kramer's prospective Oscar-winner echelon and afford Curtis a splendid career-turn with his only Oscar nomination. One could easily be aware of the shooting condition since clearly Curtis and Poitier have taken their toll in their harsh fugitive surroundings, wrestling with the precipitate torrent, the mud pit under the pouring rain, a perilous marsh and finally a running train. But those are only default set pieces to sustain the film in its narrating procedures, a sharp and sound script does remind me how slowly the civilisation progress we have achieved since only 50 years ago, the world could be utterly colour-sensitive. Curtis and Poitier's two handers are meticulously orchestrated, but among the supporting group, Cara Williams and Theodore Bikel also obtained two Oscar nominations. The former partook in the latter half and induced the most poignant confrontation for Curtis' character, choosing between freedom (even love) and the brotherhood with a black prisoner (mercifully, the finale reciprocates with the same dilemma for Poitier). Meanwhile, Williams exhibits a dooming desperation out of the unsatisfied woman without being sidelined as a cipher in the plot. Bikel, is the Sheriff with a kind heart, whose gritty and congenial persona has re- established the integrity of the police force. Last but not the least, Poitier's a cappella rendition of W.C. Handy's "Long Gone (From Bowlin' Green)" has been repeated three times in the film, the beginning, the middle section (where they are caught by the village people) and the ending, precisely elevating the film's brio and set a great example of how a theme song could generate such an ineffable passion and evocation into a film's texture. ps: the film got two Oscars among its 9 nominations, BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY BLACK &amp; WHITE and BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The simplest of ideas executed in about the best way thinkable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we have a movie about two convicts, that have escaped but are chained together. Even bigger problem is; the one is white and the other one black. Doesn't sound like a big deal but you have to take into consideration that this is a '50's movie, that is being set in the south.So the movie has a real simple basic main premise but it gets executed in about the best way thinkable. It's a movie that deals with lots of issues and above all things obviously racism but it above all things also really is one great character movie.This is a movie that required lots of great acting from its actors. They had to make the story and characters work out believable but also needed to have the capability to deliver the movie its great, often long, monologues. And the acting was really what made this movie work out so well for me. It often kept the movie going and was giving it all lots of depth as well. Sidney Poitier was always a great actor in these sort of roles and somehow always managed to help and uplifts his fellow actor's performances. Tony Curtis, who passed away yesterday, was also really great in his role and it earned him his first and only Oscar nomination. This movie also earned Sidney Poitier his first Oscar nomination by the way and the movie got nominated for a lot more, including best picture but it eventually won only two, for its writing and black &amp; white cinematography.it's an heavy movie with its subject but luckily the movie overall remains quite entertaining to watch as well. There is some relieving humor and some adventurous aspects about the entire movie. The movie manages to create a great balance between it's more serious message and to keep its viewers entertained. Nevertheless, the movie still tends to get a bit overlong in parts, mostly only toward its ending, which makes this movie feel longer than it in fact really is.A great and also enjoyable character movie, that is dealing with some serious- and at its time also relevant subjects.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Revolutionary Concept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two prisoners in the American South, Noah Cullen and John "Joker" Jackson, escape together from a chain gang. What sets "The Defiant Ones" apart from other prison break dramas is that Cullen is black and Jackson white. In fact, at the time this film was made (1958) prisons, like virtually every other institution in the Deep South, were racially segregated, a fact which in itself says something about the nature of American racism. Presumably the rationale behind this segregation was that to force white prisoners to co-exist with blacks would have been regarded as a cruel and unnatural punishment for the whites. (Robert Mitchum, who had himself been a prisoner on a chain gang during his teens, is said to have turned down the role of Jackson because of this error of fact).The makers of this film, however, were more concerned with symbolism than with strict factual accuracy. It starts off with the two men loathing each other, which is hardly surprising given that Jackson is a hard-bitten racist who refers to Cullen, and all African-Americans, as "n-words". As they are chained together, however, they are forced to cooperate, and their mutual hatred gradually turns to grudging respect, then to friendship. (Jackson gives up using the n-word and replaces it with "coloured", less politically incorrect in the fifties than it would be today). The movie ends with Jackson giving up a chance to escape in order to save Cullen's life.In the 1950s, major film roles for black actors were few and far between. Even in a film like "Showboat", in which racial discrimination is an important theme, all the biggest parts are played by white actors. (Julie, for example, who is supposed to be of mixed race, is played by Ava Gardner). The same is true of "To Kill a Mockingbird", and that was made four years after "The Defiant Ones". Here, however, the two actors, Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier, are given equal prominence. (Curtis insisted that Poitier share equal billing with him).Both men are excellent in their roles; the film helped to establish Poitier as one of the first major black stars, and persuaded the cinema-going public that Curtis was an actor of substance, something more than just a handsome matinée idol. Both were nominated for "Best Actor" Oscars but lost out to David Niven for his part in "Separate Tables". (As it is many years since I last saw that film I will suspend judgement as to the merits of that decision). The film itself was not perhaps in my view the best of 1958 (that was probably "The Big Country"), but it was certainly better than "Gigi" which unaccountably took the "Best Picture" award.Despite the brilliance of Curtis and Poitier, "The Defiant Ones" is not simply a two-man show. There are also some equally good contributions from the supporting cast. Those who stood out were Theodore Bikel, Lon Chaney, Jr, Charles McGraw, and Cara Williams. McGraw and Bikel play two law enforcement officers with quite differing philosophies, a gung-ho State Police captain who wants the two escaped prisoners back dead or alive (preferably dead) and the relatively liberal and humane local sheriff who would prefer to recapture them alive or not at all. Chaney plays "Big Sam", a villager who saves the two from a lynch mob after they are captured breaking into a general store. (It turns out that Sam himself is a former prisoner). Williams has an important role at the end of the film. She plays a divorced woman who initially befriends the two escapers but later suggests to Jackson that he should betray Cullen, leaving him free to escape with her.Today a film on a theme like this would probably be little more than a trite, hackneyed anti-racist parable, but in the world of the 1950s it was a revolutionary concept. It was made at a time when calls by black Americans for equal rights and an end to segregation and discrimination were becoming more insistent; the famous Montgomery bus boycott, for example, had begun three years earlier. For a long time Hollywood had been part of the problem. It had rarely made explicitly racist films (although there were notorious exceptions such as "Birth of a Nation"), but had nevertheless concentrated on films by white Americans, for white Americans, about white Americans. Black actors were relegated to minor roles and the experiences of black Americans ignored. A film like "The Defiant Ones" suggested that, at long last, Hollywood could be part of the solution. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chain gang convicts Tony Curtis (as John Jackson) and Sidney Poitier (as Noah Cullen) make an escape, after their transporting truck overturns on a rainy road. Still shackled together, the duo must learn to just get along as they flee from a mob of lawmen and bloodhounds. Mr. Curtis is a classic white Southern racist, but he has a cuddly heart underneath. Mr. Poitier is an angry black man, but noble to a fault - you innately know he was unjustly sent up. They may be stereotypes, but Curtis and Poitier perform the parts exceptionally well. And, you've got to admit they were incredibly proactive in keeping their cigarettes and matches in plastic zip-lock bags. When you remember that Stanley Kramer made "The Defiant Ones" in 1958, you cut them some slack."The Defiant Ones" won the "Best Picture" award given by the "New York Film Critics" with their "Best Director" of the year going to Mr. Kramer. Curtis and Poitier were both nominated for "Best Actor" Oscars and Golden Globes, almost certainly canceling each other out - though, some groups favored Poitier. The script and photography (by Sam Leavitt) were also winners. In an interesting supporting performance, lustful Cara Williams made several lists of supporting actresses, and sheriff Theodore Bikel was considered one of the year's best supporting actors. In convincing small roles, watch for Lon Chaney Jr. lending a helping hand, Claude Akins talking tough, young Kevin Coughlin playing a racist kid, and rascally Carl "Alfalfa" Switzer appearing for the last time.******* The Defiant Ones (7/58) Stanley Kramer ~ Tony Curtis, Sidney Poitier, Cara Williams, Theodore Bikel</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very interesting film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent film, that happened to have been shown on TCM. I found it surprising that this movie was completed in 1958, during a time of segregation in the United States. It proved that we could be equal, even if you are chained together.John and Noah are escaped prisoners who escaped after a prison bus crashed. One is white, and one is black. This pair was made because the warden apparently had a sense of humor. Everyone is looking for them, and they get into many situations trying to benefit from each other, and they eventually get to like each other, even when the chains are off.This was a very interesting movie, with a shock twist in the ending. Shows that even during a time of segregation, you knew there were people that knew what was right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mismatched convicts on the run</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story about the chain team instead of the chain gang pulled off successfully by two Hollywood legends. Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier team up to give an insightful view of buddy bonding while the sheriff's dogs are always closing in.Both Noah Cullen (played by Poitier) and John "Joker" Jackson (played by Curtis)are chained together but are freed when their transport bus flips over. What follows are two men, one white the other African American, with the common desire to escape from the law flee, through the rugged terrain of the south.At first the two don't get along. Yet they are stuck with each other because each have a wrist handcuff linked from wrist to wrist and each are running from the law. They can't get rid of each other for obvious reasons. What ensues are fights between the two until both come to the realization that they need each other to escape the law.At first they argue which way to go. Cullen wants to go north and Jackson wants to go south. Yet they both have one directions they want to go and that's away from the sheriff and his posse. What ensues is a journey through the rocked filled rapid rivers. Once safely ashore, the journey then leads into a quarry deep ditch. Afterward to a small town where they are looking for something to eat.During the whole ordeal Sheriff Max Muller (played by Theodore Bikel) follow them with dogs and his men. The suspense is maintained with acute timing by the director Stanley Kramer. This movie relies heavily on timing since two escaped convicts are being pursued and no one knows if and they will be ever caught.During the chase, Cullen and Jackson become buddies. Cullen calls his chain mate "joker" and Jackson calls his chain mate "colored." The racist overtones in this movie is obvious. It was unheard of a white man to be chained to a black man in the south according to the sheriff's posse. So the tension of race plays a central theme. Jackson, however, never plays a die-hard racist. He jokes with Cullen and tells him to call him names about the whiteness of his skin as a sign that racism doesn't exist between the two.Soon after Curtis made this movie he starred in his most famous film "Some Like It Hot." And Poitier was already known by his star performance in "Blackboard Jungle." Yet together they have chemistry. Jackson as a realist, knowing his place in life, and Cullen as an angry man knowing life's injustices.The coming together of their different personalities creates tension and feelings of friendship that carries throughout the film. It's tough to say which actor outperformed the other because both turned in stellar performances.The movie, however, sometimes lacks plausibility. Some parts of it are simply unrealistic and give the movie a make believe Hollywood feel to it. Nonetheless the acting is so strong one could suspend belief for a moment to care about what happens to the characters. The acting carries the plot in a well paced adventure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>two great leads and some solid storytelling keep it mostly afloat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to conceive that the same man who directed The Defiant Ones, Stanley Kramer, would direct Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. While both films are after some level of reaching racial equality, one deals with the issue in the context of a thriller and gives a powerful script based on believable characters, both in their present contexts and their past, while the other is turgid and so preachy that you can feel the pulpit crack from which Kramer stands. It's worrisome to go from that over-praised pablum that, oddly enough, also co-starred Sidney Poitier, to another work, but thankfully The Defiant Ones holds up as a mostly powerful film because it doesn't shove race and bigotry in your face at every moment. At least, not every one. But when it does come up its put around the characters first, not the premise, the progression of the characters in this situation proves compelling... again, for the most part.Premise: two guys on a chain gang escape after the car holding them and the other prisoners crashes in the middle of a rainy night. The two together are Cullen, Poitier, and Johnny "Joker", Curtis. They don't like each other, as shown in the first scene where Joker very clearly drops the 'N' bomb due to Cullen continually singing a chain gang song. They'd much rather not be together, but without a chisel and hammer there's little to do but to keep running, scrounge for food, make sure the other doesn't die and/or kill the other first (not so much to help the other but to help himself such as when they're in river rapids), and naturally not get caught.Things happen to them and around them in the story that get them, against their own judgment, bond with one another. Not exactly as friends but guys with a common goal: reach the train and get out of the sticks. What's remarkable is not exactly how Kramer directs them or creates tension - frankly I put most of the credit to the craftsmanship on Oscar winner DP Sam Leavitt - but how he lets the two stars play the characters their own way. They're not stereotypes, and while they may encounter some along on their journey, such as the white trash lynch mob or Billy's mother as a desperate farmer's ex-wife, they hold their own as people we can go along for the ride with. It is about the issue, sure, but it's a thriller that sends us along and tries to have us not know where it will go.For a while, too, it threw me off. I wasn't sure if they would escape, or together at least, and it's what kept me hooked. Even with the sorta twist with the swamp getaway Kramer kept things moving along at a good pace. It's only around the end that things get a little too, well, of the period. The edge is lost a bit, even as one can see why the film as to end the way it does. If it only could stay truer to the rest of the story and how the characters progress then it would be great. As it stands though The Defiant Ones is fine work and only dated inasmuch that it's from 1958 and on the cusp of the civil rights movement. There's some smoke and fire, which is more than can be said of Kramer's later films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two prisoners on the run</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Defiant Ones" is a truly great film starring Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier, both of whom earned their money and deserved their Oscar nominations in this exciting and moving film, beautifully directed by Stanley Kramer.Marlon Brando was to star in the movie but when it didn't happen due to Kramer having to wait for Poitier to finish a film, Curtis, complete with nose putty (which he often relied on to make himself less handsome) took over and showed what he could really do with a good role. Curtis and Poitier are prisoners. John, called Joker, and Noah, being transported when an accident on the road frees them. Though they have no love for one another, they're handcuffed together. Joker uses the 'n' word and calls Noah "boy" - in fact, the racism in the film is rampant all the way through. At one point they wind up at a farmhouse where a horny woman (Cara Williams) lives with her son, and, freed from the cuffs, the two can separate; the Williams character wants to go with Joker and take her car, and Noah can go through the swamp and get a train that goes by every day. But all the running, the filth, the wet, and nearly being lynched has caused a change to occur in both men.A very compelling movie, a little dated today, but it still holds up. Lon Chaney Jr. is excellent as a man who runs a turpentine work camp, and the other actors in the film are very good as well. Curtis said the men didn't have to be black and white, they just had to be two people who didn't like one another and were forced to survive together. That's true. Wonderful story starring two truly great actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Badly dated drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the deep South a car transporting prisoners to jail crashes. Most of the prisoners live but two escape--John Jackson (Tony Curtis) and Noah Cullen (Sidney Poitier). They're also chained to each other. Naturally they hate each other but (sigh) slowly learn to respect and care for each other.What a dated movie. Seriously--THIS won a Best Screenplay Oscar? I find it hard to believe that even in 1958 this was considered daring. The talks and insights are thoroughly predictable and I actually rolled my eyes a few time at how obvious this was getting. Also there are glaring lapses in continuity---after Jackson and Cullen are caught in a raging river AND running through the rain, Jackson's cigarettes AND matches are completely dry and we get to watch him smoke nonstop. To make matters worse they run into a woman (Cara Williams) at the end and the film comes to a screeching halt (and it was already slow to begin with!).On the plus side--the acting was great. Curtis and Poitier play well off each other and make their change from hatred to caring seem realistic. Also it was fun to see Lon Chaney in a rare dramatic role and he was great! It was well directed by Stanley Kramer and won a well-deserved Oscar for cinematography. But, all in all, I found this boring, heavy-handed and slow-moving. Time is not kind to all movies and this is proof positive of that! I give it a 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously, when "The Defiant Ones" first came out, it was probably a revolutionary idea: a white man and a black man chained to each other escape from a chain gang and have to put aside their differences to survive. I guess that nowadays, we look at it and feel that they were trying to look good by portraying social issues. No matter, it is a pretty good movie, and Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier do an intense job as John "Joker" Jackson and Noah Cullen, respectively. Not to sound wimpy or anything, but the movie does have a good point in affirming that if we want to accomplish our goals, we do have to accept each other. Stanley Kramer did always have some good ideas for movies, with this one, as well as "Inherit the Wind", "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" and "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner".</fullReview>

In spite of the fact that they were criminals, still, I could easily relate to their situation. The acting was superb and is worthy of a great movie watching session. One thing that got me was that Caucasians at least in that era could be so damn insensitive toward Negroids. The movie culminates nicely to the end where they are so close to achieving their goal. Where the racial harmony finally strikes a chord at the end of the film and the musical ending was a nice touch.. still, I would have like them to end leaving on the train. I leaving on the train together after the handhold had instead worked.. I think this would have been an equally fine racial ending, with the added ethical question of have they paid enough for their crimes</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Kramer one of the most respected film directors of all timein 1958 made the "Defiant Ones" one of the most important filmsin history that deals with racism and prejudice. After Stanley Kramer returned from the service in WWII he starteddirected his own Independent Films. During this time in the 1950'sdesegration in Little Rock , Arkansas was taking place.The Civil Rights movement was just getting started with respectedminister Martin Luther King and civil riots were a theme of the day.Kramer, seeing that this issue was something that needed to bediscussed and faced, not brushed under the carpet, Kramersought Sidney Poiter and Tony Curtis to star in this breakthroughfilm. Black actors like Poiter in the cinema were practically nonexistenor had subordinate roles, playing the slave or the hired hand infilms like "Gone With The Wind". However, Poiter was one of thefirst Black, African American actors to not be received equal billingwith his white counterparts, but the one of the first to be recognizedfor his acting skills and his movies that dealt with prejudice andracism (In The Heat Of The Night). The film's plot is about 2 convicts, (Curtis and Poiter) who escapeafter a van accident. (Curtis and Poiter) who are chained together go through the filmtrying to free themselves, while trying to rid themselves of theanger and racist attitudes they have towards each other.At several points of the film, Curtis calls Poiter a "nigger" which isan insulting remark to a black man, denoting the individual as aslave. Both men , eventually learn more about each other and come tothe grips to the reality of racism. The film also features special apperences by Lon Chaney, bestknown as playing the "Wolf Man". The Defiant Ones is not a great show of filmmaking, but animportant discussing many problems in our society. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Defiant Ones is not a family flick. It is for adults 15 and older. Tony Curtis is top billed. Sidney Poitier is very good in this film. They were both nominated for best actor but lost with the split vote. This is a "coming of age" film for America. Being made before Civil Rights were enforced and accepted, this movie teaches us that we have a lot of growing together as Americans versus simply as blacks or whites. Today, no one would understand why this film could bring out such deep racial biases. The movie is ahead of its time. It would have been better accepted if made in the late 60s or early 70s. The actors all do a fine job in this film. Although a bit slow paced (you need the time to listen the emotions being worked out), the movie does seem to hold my attention. This is a serious movie and deals with some serious emotions. The ending of the movie is quite appropriate for the two who have to work together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Douglas Sirk truly was the king of melodrama, then Stanley Kramer must have been the prince. In the 1960's he made films, dealing with controversial issues: racial prejudices (Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, 1967) and conservative Christianity vs. liberal science (Inherit the Wind, 1960). Although, both of the films were powerful cuts into the core of the American society, they were still strongly characterized by comedy. However, in the 1950's, he made even more fierce films which relayed a desolate and melancholy world view: On the Beach (1959) is a story about a group of people who have escaped to Australia from a nuclear disaster, only to wait their inevitable death. The Defiant Ones (1958) is far from the former's hopelessness but it also presents a dark world and people, without idealistic illusions. In both films, people are dissatisfied and unheroic, and only a small dose of optimism is given, not to the characters, but to us.Unlike On the Beach, The Defiant Ones was a great success. It won two Oscars and is today considered as a major American classic. It was a dive into racism that reigned America during the time but also to an important moment of transition. Old values and absolute morality were questioned as the new generation grew up and, for the first time, youth culture was born. But that's another story. In The Defiant Ones Kramer was able to approach the American society and its people without illusions or formal idealism. The story of two different men, chained together, is really a picture of lonely people stuck in their desolate existence.The visual aesthetics reinforce the film's contents which are characterized by the existentialism of the 1950's: mud, pits, ditches, wet surfaces, run-down towns and rail ways, rivers and woods. The title of the film "The Defiant Ones" indicates to the men, chained together, but it also draws a wider picture of society. The men aren't really the defiant ones but the people around them are. The muddy landscapes, and especially the scene where the men fall to a pit, relay an emotion of stagnation. There is no destiny but as if the choices of the characters are inevitable and predetermined; already in the beginning we know that no salvation or any bright future awaits them. People are lonely and that hole they try to fill with hopes and dreams. Because it is all they have. Their lives are meaningless, there is no God or deliverance for them. No higher purpose. Just unbearable loneliness.However, loneliness doesn't just characterize the lives of these two characters as it can be seen everywhere in the society: one man who helps the police dotes his life on his dogs, the woman lives without friends or a lover, and the man in the village feels more connected with the criminals than with his fellow men. People have no future, which the swamps and mud highlight, they can only dream. But optimism won't last forever. Only love can save them for a short while from complete desperation and anxiety.Even though The Defiant Ones is a desperate film it is also, paradoxically, compassionate and funny. The ending proves that there is still hope because Curtis wins over his paragon. The thesis of the film could be that racism and all intolerance are just forms of fear. But it's just one of the film's many themes as it also brilliantly depicts existentialist agony: "What a way to live: to be quiet your whole life and only make noise when you die." To the lives of the protagonists Kramer has projected his idealized picture of the world which is still marked by loneliness and darkness. He seemed to understand that there is no eternal bliss. It's a dark picture but honest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Defiant Ones, The (1958) **** (out of 4) Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier, white and black, play escaped convicts, chained together, who are trying to make their escape without killing one another. This is certainly one of the greatest films ever made and it hasn't lost any power in the fifty-years since it has been made. This is an incredibly powerful film and it speaks very highly that it would still remain so powerful even though the racial tensions of today aren't nearly the same as in 1958. I've seen this film countless times over the years but it keeps getting better with each new viewing and I think I fall in love with something different with each new viewing, which is the sign of a true classic. There were a lot of racial movies made during this period and thankfully the majority of them, including this one, doesn't try preaching to the crowd. Instead, they simply tell their story and let the viewer see the injustice or issues going on. The film won an Oscar for its screenplay, which it certainly deserved because if the dialogue had been boring then there wouldn't have been a film. The dialogue is so powerful and intense and again, thankfully it never becomes preachy. The performances by Curtis and Poitier are terrific and I certainly think this is the greatest work done by Curtis. The way these two men shape their characters is truly breathtaking to watch and both actors make these among the most memorable characters from any film ever made. The supporting cast also gets a lot of terrific performances including Theodore Bikel, Charles McGraw and Cara Williams. A special note should also go out to Lon Chaney, Jr. who was usually being wasted in Z productions but here gets a great role and does wonders with it. There's always a debate on what makes a film a classic and I think all of the ingredients can be found in this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good movie, and WITHOUT a doggone message!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of reviews talk about the race issue that this movie dealt with, which it does, but I don't watch movies for messages or meaning. I watch for entertainment, which this movie gives. There ARE a couple of slow parts, but other parts you might think are slow, are actually not because of the great dialog. There are many scenes of the two men just sitting around talking, and it's VERY interesting. Poitier is amazing as always, Curtis does well, and there is a great supporting cast from the various police and the villagers. A very GOOD movie.

		<shortDescription>Hollywood grit...but on that level, well-done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier are very good as escaped racist convicts--chained together by one wrist--attempting to allude Southern police and their bloodhounds not far behind. Still, director Stanley Kramer's hot-blooded, hot-headed film stirs controversy with an awfully heavy hand. Kramer isn't interested in subtleties or details; he plows ahead, full of angry, pumped-up steam, and the two brawling characters (seen sometimes as two silly children) each take turns spouting off. The cliché of the lonely divorcée living on a lonely patch of land with her young 'un is played for high drama, but it lapses into camp. Still, the unspoken loyalty between the men is captured vividly (thanks to the performances) and the movie does pack a punch, even if its redneck/lynch mob/racially heated scenario feels Hollywoodized--with do-gooder intentions--and the theme of brotherhood is hammered home as if this were an educational film. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>imagine a bunch of former Ku Klux Klansmen and their bubba buddies from the backwoods of Georgia doing "Fiddler on the Roof" to get some kind of idea about howlingly inauthentic this production is.(the bloodhounds did look authentic, though.)nonetheless, i give it a "7" because this exercise in (supposed) 'social realism' is about something other than sex and violence. well, at least it isn't about sex. okay, not explicitly so.besides, it's always fun to see character actors from that era, like Claude Akins and Lon Chaney, Jr, even with the volume muted to escape the jarringly false-sounding accents of their fellow performers.of course, Sidney Poitier (with or without audio) makes the other leading players seem like students doing summer stock (not that they needed his help to do so). but then, that's why Sidney Poitier is *Sidney Poitier*.and, hey, they all meant well, which is more than can be said for much of today's offerings from popular culture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seems a little heavy-handed today but still works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though this movie has dated considerably and presents its still valid issues in a very different context from today's racial troubles around the world, it still presents a profound and moving message about how friendship and respect grow out of intimacy. The enemy-to-friend arc of the plot is a standard now but this is a classic exploration of the theme, as well as a fairly good prison-break movie in more general terms. Despite the sentimentality Poitier manages a majestic performance and Curtis, though not quite as adept at slow-witted losers than fast-talking charmers, does very well too. The whole background plot with the posse chasing them is also good, injecting just the right balance of lighter moments and tension as they close in. Top-ish notch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All About Relationships</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering that this movie was made in the late 1950's, it's a fairly courageous exploration of race relations seen through the eyes of two escaped convicts (Tony Curtis &amp; Sidney Poitier)who, being chained, have to overcome their mutual animosity.It's interesting to watch their relationship progress from mutual hostility to co-operation, genuine affection and even loyalty to each other. The decision to introduce a "love angle" to the story, as Jackson (Curtis) and Cullen (Poitier) take refuge with a single mother (Cara Williams) was questionable in my view, although it served to further our understanding of how close Jackson and Cullen had become.The exploration of relationships was continued in the subplot about the relationship between the local sheriff's office and the State Police as they try to track down the escaped convicts. I frankly found the repeated shifts back to the "posse" to be distracting and would have preferred to see the focus remain on Curtis and Poitier.It's a good movie, but it could have been improved.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can decades really show us how naive we were at the time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sometimes like to watch a "classic" that I have never seen before.I was fully expecting to see a great film, based on the Oscars and the actors. What I received was a reminder that Oscars are given primarily for bold moves in the film industry (now no longer bold) and acting has come a long way since the 50s.I don't normally "bash" on the classics, but I certainly did not get half of what I was expecting. Here are some painful points:- All of the actors and actresses seemed very rigid, like they were trying to hit some sort of queue mark -- save Sidney at moments and the gentleman that saved them from the mob. - Sidney's singing was very annoying (I knew that he was trying to show his defiance, but it was so annoying and without feeling it diminished the point).- Everyone was quick to light up a cancer-stick. We're drowned, beat up, dogs on our tail - but hey, lets act cool right now and make it a point to have a puff or two before we say some really deep lines to each other.- Guy with dogs seriously overacted - I've never seen anyone try to pet a dog so fast and hard. He was harder on the dogs than the hunt was.- Sheriff was totally unbelievable. Would pause at odd times and I had to wonder if I had ever met anyone so lethargic before.- Cara Wiliams had the best part of all - play a mother that throws her kid away while throwing herself at some con that walks into your house. - duh.Here are some good points:- Seeing a much younger Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier was kinda neat.- The racial animosity/tolerance thing. I can imagine that, for its time, this was a very bold move. While both overdone and underdone at times, it still serves us a reminder that people are people and we should try and forget the stereotypes we create. -- (it was this that got me to the end of the movie).- You will better appreciate films being created today even the two stars :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vastly overrated. While the subject matter of this film was surely controversial in 1958, it's simply not a good film: Tony Curtis doesn't' sound believable for a second as a supposedly tough convict, Theodore Bikel (? ? a Jewish singer/actor) as a Southern sheriff isn't believable either, and the entire concept of a woman so lonely that she would take in not only two convicts in chains, but a black prisoner at all, is completely laughable. There are some fine moments in this, and I understand its cultural importance, but it's nothing special.This script won an Oscar ? Must have been a lean year.Vote: 5</fullReview>

Sidney Poitier was the leading black actor in the 50's, but not even with him around did Hollywood stop using minstrelsy, or discussing interracial issues without using black actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good but the impact of the film is lessened with time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the deep South during the height of racism, a back and white prisoner are inexplicably chained together while a group of prisoners are being transported. There is an accident, the two men are stuck having to make their escape--which is tough considering that they hate each other--much of it due to racism.I noticed that some referred to this as the best film about racism. Well, while I would agree that for the time it was pretty good, I certainly would NOT put it among the very best--there are many wonderful films that deserve these sort of accolades. For example, "Intruder in the Dust" is a better film AND came out nearly a decade before "The Defiant Ones". "Nothing But a Man" is another fine film about race that seemed to have a greater impact on me than this 1958 film. In addition, as Bob the Moo said in his review, the message was NOT the least bit subtle and the film would have been better served if the race issue hadn't been beating the audience over the head. Still, if was very good and is worth seeing--especially because you get to see that Tony Curtis could act if given a meatier role. As for Sidney Portier, EVERYONE knows he's a fine actor, so he is less noteworthy in this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If only Elvis and Sammy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From what I understand Elvis and Sammy Davis Jr. were offered the roles initially. Elvis loved Sammy and wanted very much to do it. Colonel Tom put the kibosh on it due to his bigoted ways. He was afraid the white public might avoid paying to see Elvis chained to a black man, even if it was Sammy. Tom Parker was a southern redneck who spoiled many deals that would have enriched and extended the career of Elvis. He also prevented E from making A Star Is Born with Streisand years later. He sold the complete recording library of Elvis music to RCA for half a million dollars to pay his gambling debts. Years after Elvis died Eddie Murphy saw Parker in Vegas and approached to say how much he admired Elvis. Tom brushed him aside and rubbed his nappy head for luck. A racist he was till the day he died.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hopelessly Dated *SPOILER* ALERT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT*This movie may have once been considered groundbreaking, but assessed now, it fails to stand the test of time. What is particularly appalling is its sexist use of a woman's betrayal as a plot device to awaken the white man's empathy for the black man. Her desperate sexuality is portrayed as ruthless (she's ready to abandon her own son as well as the black character for it) and ultimately repellent, as the white man rejects her in favor of his black 'friend' (who he was trying to murder only the day before!).In a time when the discussion of racial politics was virtually non-existant in the popular culture, this film might have been gripping and poetic. However now it only seems awkward, simplistic, and yes, embarassingly sexist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Dramatic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw it I wrote in my diary: "Contrived stuff, but entertaining." Ten years later:"The movie has serious flaws. The whole idea of having a black and white man chained to each other, is silly and unconvincing, particularly when they physically fright each other. The movie's most serious flaw is the long initial scene in which policemen and detectives roam around aimlessly and discuss trivial stuff. The plot should have concentrated entirely on the fugitives and the people they encounter. The police need not be shown to make the movie dramatic. Another flaw is the casting. Neither Curtis nor Poitier look like criminals. Hollywood is too insecure to pick unknowns. They have to go for that sure thing, the big star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Bowling Green - Sewing Machine!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In all abject honesty, time hasn't been the kindest to The Defiant Ones. Pushing 45 years old, the movie is an often pedestrian manhunt thriller where some occasionally ropey extras lead a hunt, giving Curtis and Poitier chance to sit around and spark racial ethics off one another.It's this heavy-handed approach that often jars nowadays, or maybe history has blurred and we are thankfully blind to a time when Sidney would be mistrusted merely due to his colour. Though I'm sure this isn't entirely the case, and a variety of old-fashioned precepts (including Cara Williams as a randy southern housewife) ensure this film is now a product of another age.I'd still argue that this is one of Sidney's five finest films (along with In the Heat of the Night, A Raisin in the Sun, Edge of the City and No Way Out) and deserves a place in any drawn-up list of "The 100 greatest movies". But as time draws on, it slips down that rank with it's almost niave symbolism and existence as a template for social comment. For while the debate over racism and tolerance are still as valid as ever, it is Jackson?s (Curtis) and Cullen's (Poitier) uneering ability to constantly refer to them that detracts. Didn't these guys ever talk about sport or anything? This film is issue first, picture second, stealing from it a mild sense of realism.But this is not a bad film, not by any means. The ending is as perfect as ever, and when the two leads are on the screen, it does generate the vital chemistry needed to sustain interest. Curtis is no Rod Steiger, but he is an excellent screen actor and gives able support to Sidney as a man with a chip on both shoulders. This is not the cruelly-dubbed ?Super Sidney? of latter years who stands by with dignity while white players abuse him, but a three-dimensional character with an attitude problem who strikes back at his persecutors. If it?s one-note, A to B plotting fails to strike the same chords it once did, then The Defiant Ones is still a classic of the genre, and well worth revisiting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Defiant Ones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Stanley Kramer (Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, I saw this film once before when I was in college, I later saw it listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I definitely needed to see it again for a much stronger opinion. Basically at night a truck is driving, and swerves to avoid colliding another truck, and in doing so it crashes the barrier and turns onto it's side, this truck was in fact full of chain gang prisoners, the rescuers clearing the debris find most prisoners in the back killed, but they also find two are missing. These two prisoners chained together are white John 'Joker' Jackson (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Tony Curtis) and black Noah Cullen (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Sidney Poitier), both despise each other initially, but their hands are chained together as they run across the American South to find a way to break their chains, as well as food and a place to hide. The authorities are told not to look too hard, as they are sure that the two men will kill each other before making their getaway, they are unaware that the two mens' co-operation motivated by self-preservation has become respect and like for each other, but a large posse with bloodhounds are dispatched the following day to search for them. Joker and Cullen travel through various weathers and terrains, stopping briefly at a company town in attempt to rob a general store for food and tools, but they are caught by the inhabitants, Big Sam (The Wolf Man's Lon Chaney Jr.) persuades the lynch mob to lock the convicts up and turn them in by morning, but Sam is himself a former chain gain prisoner, and he releases the two men. The two men run into young boy Billy (Kevin Coughlin), who takes them to his home and Mother (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Cara Williams), her husband abandoned the family, she makes them some food, and the prisoners finally break their chains, she allows them to stay the night as she is attracted to Joker. Later the Mother wants to run off with the Joker, she advises Cullen to to go across the swamp to reach the nearest railroad tracks, the two men agree to split up, but after Cullen leaves the Mother reveals she had lied to him, she sent him into the dangerous to die and not reveal where Joker was, there was perhaps a racism from her part as well, Joker is furious and runs to find his friend, getting wounded when Billy shoots him. Joker catches up to Cullen and warns him about the swamp, but they realise the posse, led by humane Sheriff Max Muller (Oscar nominated Theodore Bikel), and the dogs are close, they hear a train whistle and run towards it, Cullen hops onto the moving train, but weak Joker cannot catch up, and they end up tumbling together down the hill, exhausted to run anymore all they can do is wait to be caught by the pursuers, the Sheriff finds Joker and Cullen near the river. Also starring Charles McGraw as Captain Frank Gibbons, King Donovan as Solly, Battle for the Planet of the Apes' Claude Akins as Mack and Lawrence Dobkin as Editor. Curtis managed to shake of his "pretty boy" image playing his bigoted white prisoner, and Poitier became a big star playing the angry southern black man, together in chains for three quarters of the film they are a fantastic duo who hate each other at first but become close friends, this film at the time was definitely a great statement for the need of racial equality, the script is full of both punch and poignancy, and it works really well as an exciting chase movie, a highly entertaining crime drama. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing and Best Picture, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Film Promoting International Understanding. Sidney Poitier was number 52 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 22 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 47 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 55 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I imagine when this came out in 1958 it was groundbreaking. However watching this 50 years later it is terribly outdated. The plot is mediocre, the acting is wooden and atrocious, and you don't really get to care about these two men. I have seen this done better. In fact this is probably one of Sidney Sidney Poitier's worst movies. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone in particular. There is so much that could have been done better with this starting with a better script. What's worse is the fact this received so many Oscar wins (2) and nominations (9). I can't believe that it won best screen story especially. I mean really? Really? The script is really bad. I guess if you saw this when it came out you would have loved it, but it really doesn't hold up at all.</fullReview>
