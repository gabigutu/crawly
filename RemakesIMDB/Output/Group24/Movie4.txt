		<fullReview>Got a wasted day..?? This movie's gotta everything to make it all right. Well cooked story, nice and gripping presentation, power-packed performances.. and a humor different than the conventional slapstick humor that we get in movies these days (well, at least it was presented differently).Priyadarshan is really a come-back in this one. Though I liked this fella always, but his movies had been following a routine kinda trail and all his experiments like Bhagam Bhaag have been failing miserably. But this movie was really a welcome break from his side.Akshay Kumar, as he has already proved several time, has got a great comic timing. He brings twists to the movie's plot as well as inside your belly as you go laughing all the way. Vidhya Balan looks very sweet except for once, but I'll talk no further to ruin your suspense if you haven't seen the movie yet. Paresh Rawal &amp; Rajpal Yadav are once again a treat to watch.Go see this movie. Its an ultimate stress buster. Go with the guys, and you will have even more fun. :-) I vote, "Highly Recommended".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb movie !! though i feel incorrectly named</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a movie tagged as a comedy, one which featured the likes of Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumar plus directed by Priyadarshan. Naturally everyone expects this to be a comedy. Wrong !!! This is probably the best thriller of the year. A horror flick which has touches of comedy scattered around. Kinda reminds you of Johnny Depp's Sleepy Hollow.I won't go far as comparing Sleepy Hollow with Bhool Bhulaiyaa, because they are not comparable. One is a Hollywood flick and the other Bollywood. One which is high budgeted other relatively low. But you cant but feel that the comedy which seemed forced in Sleepy Hollow is same for this flick. It really appears forced. One can feel that they can do away with the comedy in the first half of the movie all together. The sequences where the bloke has to be dumb in order to complete a holy task, just appears too forced.And yet again, Akshay Kumar's comedy reels appear so natural. But like Priyadarshan's previous Bollywood movie Bhagam Bhag, this one also is a thriller. The difference is Bhagam Bhag remains a comedy, whereas Bhool Bhulaiyaa is indeed a thriller.Vidya Balan gives a stellar performance, (I won't say why cause then you have too see the movie, I wont be giving out any spoilers) and so does Akshay Kumar, despite his so late entry almost an hour into the movie. Shiny Ahuja also appears impressive, he always does. Manoj Joshi was also very good as the elder figure of the family. Rajpal Yadav is probably the only true deserving gag reel of the movie. His small role is quite pertinent and gives you the laughs just about when and how it's necessary. Paresh Rawal and Asrani are wasted in the movie. An actor of Paresh Rawal's capability shouldn't have been used in this role. Amisha Patel is also wasted. A tinsel beauty of her caliber deserves far more screen time, though still she gives a very nice performance. But end of the day this movie will definitely be remembered by Vidya Balan's performance which is nothing short of mind blowing.Keeping in the theme of the movie, very few songs have been used. Just three in fact apart from the title track which is shown during the end credits. And the music, background score is also to the point and perfect. The camera work is superb. One might feel towards the beginning that there are some bad editing, but towards the end you can feel that everything was actually kept intentionally and are all pertinent towards the climactic sequence of the movie. The sets were crafted lavishly and the entire locations are stupendous and exquisite.Last of all, the direction, well what can I say ?? Priyadarshan is definitely the best Indian comedy director in my book, but this being his first complete horror/thriller he receives kudos in my book.9/10 !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Bollywood suspense movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bhool Bhulaiyaa" is a movie that pleasantly surprised me. I wasn't aware of the fact that this is a remake. I live in the Netherlands and only can get copies of Hindi movies. So without having any knowledge about the story I could watch this movie with fresh eyes and just loved it. The trailer is very misleading and letting people believe that it is a comedy. And I was glad that it wasn't. It is a real good suspense movie. Not in the sense that it was thrilling every minute. But you just feel that something is up. The comedy and horror elements are there to put you off course. I love the fact that they play around with superstition,religion and science. It is quite a remarkable psychological thriller. Be honest. There aren't many Indian movies like this compared to Hollywood movies. Not one minute I got bored with this movie. And let me tell you that is saying something. I have seen a lot of (American,Korean,Japanese,British,Dutch and Hong Kong)movies this year and with most of them I was very disappointed. And now you have "Om Shanti Om, "Johny Gaddar" and "Bhool Bhulaiyaa that did quite the opposite. For me this movie rocked big time. And there should be much more movies like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not watched the Malayalam original but I don't think I need to. If ever u need to to be proud of an Indian film in front of an American, this is what u'll need. A very intelligent mix of drama, suspense, thrill and comedy with traces of romance thrown in between.... Right from the start, the movie never sags. All the characters r well chosen &amp; the storyline is taut. The plot is of a couple returning to the husband's native place and a haunting they encounter there. Although the plot has been explored before, the performances by actors here are commendable. The couple seems an actual couple, the father looks like a father, everything rings true and credible. Its hard to believe they r acting. The suspense unfolds gradually and is very ably switched with other elements but the interest is never let down. The crazy doctor looks like he can do nothing! But looks can be deceptive. A very well-chosen protagonist! Different, in fact from the conventional ones...Twists n turns at d right times and finally, a fitting climax....short enough to hold attention throughout. A masterpiece of effort! A bigger budget n a little better dialog delivery esp. from Akshay cud hv made d movie flawless...In the scene where Akshay explains his discovery, he seems to be struggling for words...just a bit, though!!! All in all a gr8 movie....Rating 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>first off, i'm white - straight up Wonder Bread. my experience with Hindi films and bollywood started on march 17th, 2006 when i met my husband - he's Hindu (... well, duh, lol).up to now, my opinion of bollywood in general has been pretty much a couple of gems in a huge pile of... well, "not gems", particularly when dealing with the old films. not much by way of dancing technique, even (sorry, don't shoot me, just my white bread opinion) the vaunted hema malini, to me, does little more than jump around shaking her anatomy and flapping her arms about. a lot of the classic songs, i can't tell one from the next because they're all sung by lata mangeshkar. while she is a fantastic singer, i really wish songwriters would have taken the opportunity to showcase her voice instead of just having her do the same 6-note riff over and over. like i said, it's only imo.what a fantastically terrific exception is Bhool Bhulaiyaa! it's got all the best parts of the old Indian classic movies: lavish, luxurious sets and costumes; huge crowds that pop up out of nowhere for various odd and assorted reasons; extraneous music numbers (no particular reason why, but we'll both just jump on a bicycle that popped up out of nowhere and weave madly through the countryside singing); great dance numbers featuring crowds of ppl that were nowhere to be seen before and probably won't be seen in the rest of the film.special mention: the dance scene at the court of the evil king - i can't tell you how many times i've watched that just so i could wallow in the purity of line and the sheer crispness and clarity of expression. that duo is surely a world-class dancing pair because they are SO precise and they positively reek of expertise. the term "dancing gods" keeps coming to mind.on the other hand, while it has all the wonderful OTT-ness of a classic bollywood film of the 50s and 60s, the music has been updated - the lyrics are typically incomprehensible romantic weirdness ("i am yours, only yours, you weave through my breath" - i mean, hunh!?) but the music is modern and fresh. the characters are also a wonderful blend of high camp, high drama, and modern minimalism. i really enjoyed the scene that's reminiscent of a joke featuring a guy talking on his cell phone while a girl behind him keeps answering back thinking he's talking to her. oh - except in BB, the guy's not wearing anything and the girl is in the shower stall while he's outside.what i really like is that the movie doesn't actually EXPLAIN anything. oh, explanations are given on all sides but what's really fantastic is how it doesn't slight the old ways and put Modern Science up on a pedestal, nor does it reject the new ways in favour of ancient tradition. you make your own determination as to the truth - no matter which way you see it, it will be correct.thriller, psychological drama, romantic thriller, horror, comedy, comic tragedy, chick flick, action film - no matter what your buzz, you'll find it in Bhool Bhulaiyaa!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the best this year !!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Pedagogue of comedy has yet come again with a psychological thriller.One of the 2 main movies releasing in the week, this one is a clear winner.Set on the scenario of an NRI (Shiny)returning to India after some years along with Vidya Balan, they encounter some strange notions that villagers follow in their hometown. Shiny , determined to find the true reason of the extra normal activities, he calls in his friend , akshay kumar, who deals with such paranormal activities.To add to this mystic they are presented with a caution to enter in a particular room which has remained closed for ever so long and sole cause of the activities.Priyan has by far given true justice to the script , and perfected the art of 'Thriller film making'. It isn't the kind of comedy that you normally expect from Priyan, but the overall well presented, but the comedy scenes do see to be too verbose.This film is a true treat for the philanderers of the Akshay-Priyan-Paresh combo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the fact that the movie was promoted as a comedy, the film is a physcological thriller with a few comic situations. Priyadarshan does a good job as a director. In comparison with his previous films, he takes a leap as a director by making a movie with a genre of its own.In my opinion, Bhool Bhulaiyaa is way better than the original movie, Manichithrathazhu. Probably because of the technicians have improved since then.Akshay Kumar does his usual comic act, and he's funny here as well. Shiny Ahuja hams, but is good in parts. The last 45 minutes belong to none other than, Vidya Balan. Throughout the movie she doesn't have much to do but the steals the show with her superb performance towards the climax. Ameesha Patel looks ethereal and is effective in a small yet important role. The supporting cast are first-rate, especially Paresh Rawal, Rasika Joshi and Manoj Joshi.The songs are good; Labon Ko is easy on the ears.All in all, Bhool Bhulaiyaa is a well-executed movie, though lengthy in parts! Time-pass!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Priyadarshan's one decent film since HERA PHERI</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not a superb film, But yet seems a decent remake of CHANDRAMUKHI and Manichithrathazhu (1993) Luckily some bad comic scenes of Chandramukhi were not retained The film isn't original as such, in fact the entire climax is a copy of the latter film while the rest is copied from Chandramukhi As usual, Priyadarshan always brings his south films here The first half is slowly and steadily well developed but things get boring soon, the hysterical scenes at times are stupid like the entire Paresh Rawal scene where he doesn't speak, the length is a problem Akshay's character comes 45 minutes late and then there is focus more on comedy and some scenes are funny, though the supernatural angle takes a backseat and resurfaces slowly The entire suspense angle does catch you unaware and is well handled but the climax is a copy of the latter inspired film and it some how looks too much Yet in all fairness, the film is better then DHOL, BHAGAM BHAG and emerges a decent film Priyadarshan handles the film well, though some scenes are repetitive and also some comic scenes fall flat yet he handles the genre very well Music(Pritam) is of hit variety, though Hare Ram comes at the wrong time Cinematography is decentPerformances Akshay Kumar despite emerging late is superb He not only excels in comedy, but also does a brilliant job in serious scenes, shocking his haters he is one of the best part of the film Vidya is ordinary till the suspense is revealed and then she does a good job, though Jyothika and Shobana were better then her in the originals, yet she does a good job Shiny Ahuja isn't in form, he hams and goes over the top so badly that he gets to your nerves Manoj Joshi is in form, thankfully he doesn't make loud sounds and runs around like he usually does in Priyan movies, He is excellent Paresh Rawal is funny in few scenes, overall the same thing what he does mostly Rajpal Yadav has 4-5 scenes and he does OK, he too is repetitive the rest are okay</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bhool Bhulaiyaa is a suspense thriller with a humour. It is not as tense as the great 1996 movie "Kaun" directed by Ram Gopal Varma. However, it does have it's moments and all characters played their role very well.A newly married couple Siddharth (Shiney Ahuja) and Avni (Vidya Balan) came back from America to live in Siddharth's inherited Palace, which is known to be haunted. There is a room on the third floor which was kept locked and tied with a holy string to keep the evil spirits from coming out.The news of the marriage left Radha (Amisha Patel) with a broken heart as she was in love with siddharth.Both Siddharth and Avni are educated and do not believe in ghosts. One day Avni's curiosity got the better of her and with the permission from her husband she opened the door.Since then, series of calamities and accidents have occurred. The locals blame the Avni for their misfortune, however, Siddharth thinks it Radha who has concocted these accidents to make Avni look bad and eventually be a threat to Avni's life.Siddharth thinks Radha is mentally ill and asks his friend Dr Aditya Shrivastav (Akshay Kumar) to investigate and help Radha.You will have to see the film for the rest and I'll tell you, it is very interesting.Akshay Kumar was a very mediocre actor during his early movies and has slowly blossomed into a great actor. He's very good to watch whether it be in a comedy role or a more serious role. This brings out the best of both these roles from Akshay.7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm being generous in my rating here, ignoring the unnecessary cheap humour, songs and wastage of time in the first half of the film. Simply because the film actually transformed to something amazing in the second half.The story was excellent. It made a great mix of Indian culture and superstitions with psychiatric explanation. I loved the way in which the director has connected the belief of the entrance of a soul into an external body with dissociation identity disorder. It was a very unique exploration for Indian cinema. Also, the manner with which the psychiatrist treats Avni was interesting and well crafted.Besides the issues I've mentioned above, there were other glaring faults in the film. Firstly, the characterizations were not deep enough and the very important part of Avni's past was skimmed over while certain love angles were given more screen space. Also, some characters were just to Bollywoodish and just there for the heck of being there. Perhaps, this was because the director took a more mystery orientation that is popular with Hindi audience as compared to an exploration of the psyche of an individual.Performance wise, Vidya was quite there though she was pretty annoying in her normal role. The others were just ho-hum and anyway, most of them were wasted.In sum, the movie can be watched by everyone, especially the superstitious folks and students of psychology.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most impressive thing for me in BB was not the plot, the comedy, the music?it was the art direction. Lavish hawelis and regal courtyards form the backdrop of this comic thriller that sets the tone for much of the film's suspense moments. Even the cars look tastefully royal and the interior decoration, while a bit monotonous at times, is accurate.Coming to the story, well, it's a no-brainer that it has been inspired from a National Award winning regional film. However, the adaptation has been well thought-out and competently executed. While not gripping, it is engrossing, except when Shiny Ahuja and Vidya Balan mouth their lines. Those two form the extreme ends of bad acting, with Shiny epitomizing over-the-top hamming and Vidya being more wooden than the classy cupboards in the palace. Apart from this, the cast is good, the music ably supporting, and the editing crisp. The rationale for the mystery is nothing less than sophisticated mumbo-jumbo but, it works nevertheless.Now, if only I had a palace like that too...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All the 3 genres I like - horrors, thrillers and comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another movie by Priyadarshan , rest assured this movie stands out of the lot. Let me first confess , I have never been a Hindi movies' fan , but I do let them have their moments of glory when I actually do show up to watch some of really recommended movies reason being they don't have many movies to suite my type. Bhool Bhulaiyya (BB) came highly recommended by friends and foes alike. The movie was pretty much to my taste , I have to confess , it was one of those movies that caught my attension and held it throughout the movie. Again , I have to add , the songs were so not needed. If I am watching movies like Dhoom 2 , I really don't mind as the songs are as 'break a leg' melodious as they are in their right places .. plus we all know how those movies are gonna end .. but we show up just to watch some beautiful faces and have a good time. But movies like BB have a suspense to build up ...i mean who likes songs during suspense ... not me. But the movie doesn't let the horror get to you as it also has a scientific angle attached to it. Actors like Paresh Rawal , Akshay Kumar , Asrani and Rajpal Yadav make sure that its not a Bhoot kind of a horror which aims at nothing but to induce horror in it. Shiny Ahuja and Vidya Balan play the married couple. Hey you get to see Amisha Patel as well. Now thats a pretty face which had gone missing. Its all about a newly wed couple who just return from the US of A to a small town in India and go to live in a mansion which was locked away for decades as it was thought of to be haunted. Then the story gets more and more interesting and complicated. Some months back a rather spirited Telugu speaking friend of mine forced me to watch a movie ( not sure which south Indian language was that ) as a part of the bargain because I made him watch Batman Begins. I somewhat liked the movie ..I agreed to it as the movie had Rajnikant ... if nothing else I thought I would certainly get to see some stylish cigarette throwing , chewing gum bouncing , bad guys falling , out of this world style fighting. I remembered a scene from that movie of this King sitting and a dude and a girl in ethnic Indian dance wear dancing in front of the king till the king gets mad at some thing and slices of someone's head. Maybe my mind was playing tricks on me , maybe it was a coincidence or maybe the movie was inspired from that one. But anyway I loved BB. A very neat and decent effort I would say. Maybe I praised the movie a little too much for many people but hey the only 3 genres I like are horrors , thrillers and comedies .... and fortunately for me this movie fell under all the three. I would easily give 3 stars out of 5. A must watch !</fullReview>

NO... then why should I suffer from original or remake issue? 2nd thing I appreciated most is cinematography and art direction thoroughly in every frame of the movie. 3rd thing gripping direction and very much interesting, suspense and thrilling story-line and script by Neeraj Vora. Hats off again.I just watched it in last show yesterday and in spite of absence of Akshay Kumar for 45 mins. hardly I felt boring in few minutes but I got returns of those minutes in 2nd half which was damn damn damn interesting, gripping and psychological in last 30 mins.In short, I loved this movie so much and it is purely an entertainer and shown us great depth of human psychology and gave a hidden message to stay away from blind faith related to ghost and witches.I admire Bhool Bhulaiya</fullReview>

Mohanlal-4/5 and Akshay kumar - 0.5/5.....many bollywood fans may not like this comment...because they haven't seen "manichithrathazu"....i know the truth about awfulness of its remake because i have watched both the movies....watch "manichitrathazu" and u will know the huge differences</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bhool Bhulaiya is an other rip off of a malayalam blockbuster, and guess whom is it made by? Yes, the answer is as clear as crystal and as simple as solving 2+2 - the one and the only 'Priyadarshan'. The, not innumerable, albeit a lot many films that he has shot after being 'inspired' or rather 'run out of new, innovative thinking', he has finally taken up this, which is inspired from a malayalam super hit that is surprisingly made by him and has been bestowed many awards. Therefore, this movie has to do some justice, right? But does it? The answer is yes. Priyan has done a creditable job in this movie. After a streak of lack lusters like Dhol and a few others that are painful to the eyes, he has made a film that is decent and watchable, though not flabbergasting or fantabulous. The story is simple. People of a village fear from a ghost that is supposed to be lurking in a haveli/palace of a king who loved a girl but the girl loved someone else and the king killed the other guy and the girl committed suicide and told that she would take revenge and therefore, they seem to think that the ghost of the girl is in the haveli. Therefore they conceal the area with mantras so that no one enters there. Then the successors of the throne visit the place after traveling foreign lands. They are Shiny and Vidya. They do not pay any heed to the warnings of the villagers and Vidya opens the door and lets out the ghost. Hell breaks loose and people are attacked. Shiny suspects his friend who is played by Amisha to have a mental problem and calls a psychiatrist to treat her.There enters Akshay who can decipher clearly that she isn't mad but at last discovers that it is Vidya who has double personality, one herself and the other of 'Monjolika'. She thinks Shiny to be the king and an author to be her lover and therefore vows to kill Shiny/the king.At last, all is well as Akshay treats her and she is fine. Akshay asks Amisha for marriage and again, all is fine. Now let us proceed to the review:The good:-* Vidya's possessed act is quite convincing as her hair is all haywire and she looks as if she is a real ghost.* Akshay, even though is not is in the best form, is still likable as always.* The story with its twists and turns keeps you hooked to your place* The songs of the films, not surprisingly, by Pritam is great and catchy. I especially liked the Bengali song.*The dance sequence in the end was fabulously choreographed.The bad:-*Shiney Ahuja, even though is a good actor, has done a terrible performance in this film as he goes hammy.*Akshay has very less role as he comes only before the interval*For a psychological thriller, it isn't exactly awe-inspiring.Overall, its a likable film. Watch it if you want to see something different, 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Introducing Bhool Bhulaiya First of all let me make it clear, Bhool Bhulaiyaa is NOT an out-n-out comedy movie as its trailers suggest. It's a thriller narrated in a very entertaining way. Bhool Bhulaiyaa Story Badrinarayan Chaturvedi (Manoj Josi) is the head of the Brahmin family living in a small town were the people are very conventional and superstitious. His elder brother's son Siddharth (Shiny Ahuja) and his wife Avni (Vidya Balan) return to their ancestral village after living in US for many years. Siddharth insists in staying in his ancestral palace which for long has been uninhabited as it's considered to be haunted. Despite opposition the newly wed couple shifts to their ancestral mansion. Avni an adventurous girl breaks the ground rules to explore the room considered to be the devil's home. What follows is a series of life threatening incidents. Siddharth instinctively invites his vibrant Doctor friend Aditya (Akshay Kumar) to solve the mystery behind the mansion and the mysterious events.Who is behind all the baffling activities? Is it really ghastly or just a human trick? Watch Bhool Bhulaiyaa to uncover the mystery, for the movie ventures into one of the most confusing yet interesting study of human psychology.Bhool Bhulaiyaa Movie Review Priyadarshan has handled the complicated script extremely well. A The first half is a light comic thriller and completely revolves around the supporting characters. The lead character (Akshay Kumar) enters 45 mins into the movie and takes it to a completely different level. The second half is more of a psychological thriller. Bhool Bhulaiya has just the right ingredients of a successful movie - adequate amount of comedy, suspense and thrill to keep you at the edge of your seats throughout. Music is never really great in Priyadarshan movies but Bhool Bhulaiyaa is an exception. Two songs titled 'Allah Hafiz' and 'Hare Krishna Hare Ram' standout. The background score is outstanding.The performances are top-notch. The second half belongs to Vidya Balan. She has done complete justice to a role that demanded great on screen histrionics. Watch out as she sets the screen ablaze with a mind blowing performance in the last 20 mins. Undoubtedly her best performance to date! Akshay Kumar is surprisingly good in emotional scenes and as always brilliant with his comic timing.Shiny Ahuja is good. Amisha Patel should stop acting, the sooner the better. Paresh Rawal, Rajpal Yadav, Asrani are great in providing comic relief.my opinion Overall, Bhool Bhulaiyaa is an excellent movie. You would have never watched something like this before in a Bollywood movie.It's my most favorite movie. I would give this movie 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, but please remember this is Indian Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best part about this movie is that it is unpredictable. Priyadarshan delivers another comedy gem. His films are usually nothing like the usual masala movies. He follows the script, mostly everything is almost logical, good music and really great comedy. Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumar are brilliant. Amisha Patel looks alright and surprisingly doesn't have a big part. Vidya balan is great. The movie keeps you captivated with quite a few lol moments. Towards the end however, the overly explanatory tone of the movie slows it down. This is where I thought a little subtlety would have been great, but then remember, this is for the Indian public and most directors do not want to take any chances. Anyway, watch it and you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one good movie even it was remake of a mallayalam movie..it had comedy, thrill and psycho effects. It was well directed by priyadarshan who generally makes comedy movies more..this movie really gave good role to Akshay and vidya.. and both acted well. It really hold me to watch the move till end so i liked it more.. other than this Manorama - six feet under and Johny Gaddar were the other good thrill/suspense and entertaining movies in 2007. this movie was remake of mallayalam movie and have not seen original movie but will surely see it for entertainment purpose and not for comparing with this one as both r different language movies..with diff genre of actors.. South film industry is far better than Hindi movies comparing the variety and all other aspects..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrillier Remade as Comedy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What happens when u give a "Serious Thriller" script to a maestro of comedian? Well, U'll get Bhool Bhulaiyaa!!!!The film is actually a remake of blockbuster Kannada movie "Aptamitra" which in-turn was a remake of a Malyali movie... The same was also remade in Tamil-"Chandramukhi"... But in all these versions its a Serious Thriller... And not a comedy!!!!Priyadarshan has thus taken a trusted and a proved script... The location, Actors, Sets are all well made... Vidya Balan as usual is an Eye Candy... Nothing much to tell bout her acting though... As a whole Priyadrashan has handled the script well... There are some minor mistakes but they are all easily forgiven considering that the movie is a Comedy!!!Coming to Story...well,seeing is better than hearing in this case at least!!!..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the outset let me set the stage here:: I have seen the impeccable Tamil version (it saved Rajnikanth's skin) and for obvious reasons comparisons are bound to be drawn.For starters Priyan has given his own touch to this remake. Having uttered the word remake, its utter confusion which Bible does he follow - Malayalam/ Kannada/ Tamil? Regardless it has its dose of merits and demerits. To make a movie belonging to a genre which is forte or churn out a suspense-cum-horror? A pertinent Shakespearean question he must have faced. Ideally the movie sans comedy and promotions packaged in the similar form would have been a bulls-eye. All the OTT slap-stick antiques are forgotten once you see the credit rolls by.The lens-man needs to be applauded for his effort on capturing the palace and the city so beautifully. The set design deserves a special mention. You get transported into it immediately.Songs should have been done away entirely.The length of the movie ? should have trimmed easily by 30 minutes to create an engaging sleek horror-cum-suspense drama. Culprit: Screenplay, which is awfully slow and is noticeable at the pace the suspense unfolds and the actors mouth their lines (would it beat tortoise? I doubt). Having said that, the editor has pulled up his socks in the scenes when Akshay Kumar offers explanation to the Ramsay Brothers events. Result: Audience left in a state of utter confusion.Akshay Kumar:: Starts of as a buffoon. Enter Vikram Gokhale to mention his histrionics and he suddenly transforms to Doctor-doctor.Manoj Joshi:: Why is he barking in (n ? 1) scenes? No family history of BP I guess.Shiny Ahuja:: Not one of the roles you would want to remember.Amisha Patel:: Her role is akin to the dartboard. Well, at least Akshay Kumar hits the bulls-eye in the end. (PJ! PJ! PJ!).Priyan you don't have to force-fit Paresh Rawal, Asrani and Rajpal Yadav in every movie of yours and constipate comedy out of them.Finally the weakest link:: The much applauded "to-watch-out" rising Parineeta star, Vidya Balan. Without saying much, just watch Shobana (which fetched a National award) or simply Jyotika. Bottomline: Bengali Manjulika, oops! BTW ? can somebody provide the coordinates of this place in India which resembles Banaras, shudh-Hindi speaking people wear Rajasthani clothes, dance to balle-balle and.... and picture this ? had Bengali courtesan around 100-years ago?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Priyadarshan continues with his usual 'crime'- take an enjoyable Malayalm movie and turn it into a Hindi crap. When compared to the malayalam original 'manichitrathazhu', Bhool bhulaiyya is a crass comedy/thriller which just scratch on the surface of the original subject. Please see the malayalm original which contains scintillating performances by sobhana and Mohanlal.sobhana,the Mitr actress has won her first best actress national award for this movie. while the malayalm original excels in its adept screenplay by Madhu muttam this film fails to mix the comedy and thriller tracks convincingly. Just like his other remaking exercises this film too takes out the subtlety of the original and replaces it with loud and lewd comic situations. The textual undertones of the malayalm movie about the unconscious desires of a so-called innocent wife of a nuclear family has led to many serious textual studies in malayalm. But this priyadarshan farce with its superficiality leaves no such chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bhool Jaa iss Bullcrap Ko</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night and it was very funny...unintentionally that is. Priyadarshan's attempt at combining psychological, spiritual and supernatural elements is very laughable. He does the same in his miserable attempt to combine comedy with horror / thriller (or whatever). Having not seen the original Malayalam version, I cannot say how this remake compares. However, I think Priyadarshan is trying his best to win the worst director award (if that really existed). After watching about the first half hour, I thought the film could have had potential were it in the hands of a better director but as the film proceeds, the redeeming factors seem to be further engulfed by the wannabe ghost chick. Plot holes become more frequent. The screenplay is pathetically predictable.Talking of the cast, the film rests on Vidya Balan and she is a major disappointment (one should thank Priyadarshan for that). Even though I hadn't seen the complete original Malayalam version, I saw the final dance sequence performed by Shobana (who danced very well and looked frightening). Vidya looked hilarious (obviously that wasn't the intention) and unfortunately her dance lacked both fire and grace. In the pre-interval scenes she provides more unintentionally funny moments by screaming. There is one particular scene which was similar to a scene in Ram Gopal Verma's 'Bhoot' and I noticed how Urmila Matondkar brilliantly pulled off the metamorphosing expressions and how miserable Vidya did that.Amisha Patel who's supposed to be some kind of innocent girl, is both wooden and hamming (not at the same time of course). One does wonder whether her character really is nuts. Shiny Ahuja is completely wasted. Compared to his performance in 'Life in a Metro' where he had a small (but meaty) role, here his role is nothing out of the ordinary. The actor sadly doesn't get any scope. Paresh Rawal is very annoying.Rajpal Yadav is hilarious in a tiny role. He's definitely one of the more talented comedians today. Other than Mr. Yadav, it is Akshay Kumar who delivers a partially decent performance. He's unimpressive in the non-comedic scenes (thanks to the abysmal writing) but he excels in the comedy. I liked it that he brings humour to his psychiatrist character. A caricature psychiatrist would have been one that's serious (one with no sense of humour obviously) and overly enthusiastic about treatment and diagnosis. However, Akshay's comedic scenes (which Priyadarshan probably intended to use as a gap filler) divert the film from being a thriller/horror (or whatever it tried to be) and appear completely out-of-place. Yet, in a poorly made film, it's nice to see something that could be of a slightly redeeming factor. But then again, these are no more than a few scenes so forget about redemption.The songs are forgettable. The last song in the pre-climax (if you even call that a climax) is deafeningly bad.So, except for Rajpal Yadav and Akshay Kumar, there's nothing worthwhile about 'Bhool Bulaiyaa' which should have been more suitably titled 'Bhool Jaa iss Bullcrap Ko'. Note: Akshay and Rajpal have small roles so don't waste your time watching the film just for them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake with original performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see this film as the dawn of a new age Indian cinema, a professional cinema. No more repetition of traditional boring hero heroine stories.Bhool Bhulaiyaa is that kind of movie which caters to that part of audience which understands the director's narration through the movie yet Bhool Bhulaiyaa manages to entertain all types of audience. The story starts with the revelation of the legend of the Haveli which seems to be haunted by the soul of a dancer who had committed suicide many years ago after her lover, a court dancer is murdered by the then king who was in love with this beautiful dancer.Paresh Rawal, Asrani, Akshay Kumar are the culprits of the movie who almost manage to turn this into a comedy but all praises to all of them as they have given their best works. Akshay Kumar has a rare talent unlike other stars which manages him to bond with the audience easily. Vidya Balan does a decent role in the movie and does more than justice to her character towards the end of the movie. Manoj Joshi who plays Badrinarayan has a lot of talent I must say. Shiny Ahuja &amp; Amisha are as good as a show piece in the movie.On an all the movie is very entertaining. The courtroom dance scene is very unique &amp; beautiful, a directional work which only few Indian directors are capable of directing. Although a remake of a south Indian movie the performance is very original.I give it 6.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before watching the movie I had read some reviews and I have never been so much disappointed with any movie before. The story started alright and had hoped that it would end with solving the mystery on a scientific basis. Avini and Sidharth both claim to have no faith in superstitious mambo jumbo but in the end they turn out to be as superstitious as any one else. I had become suspicious as soon as I say Aditya dressed up as s buffoon in Ramnami dress and claiming to have taken dip in Kumbha. In this day age when we need to popularize scientific attitude in children's, this movie takes us back 600 years. This kind of story should be banned if we expect India to take its place in the modern age.</fullReview>

A more appropriate title would have been A BIG LOCK. This film is so bad, I wonder if the makers were more than 5 years old. It fails on all levels. The main theme is about multiple personality disorder but written by an idiot. If the main character transforms into somebody else, then how does she change her clothes and make up every time without anyone noticing it. She doesn't suffer from MPD, she is just working in the worst movie of the year. Avoid it</fullReview>

But since I have seen all the other versions of the same movie, I feel like its not worth the hype given to it. Because the original was in Malayalam and then came Aapthamithra in Kannada (AMAZING Performance by Soundharya), then Chandramukhi in Tamil (Okay movie but thanks to Rajini baba that it was worth watching it) and now is the Hindi version of it.If you haven't watched any of the other versions, I strongly advise you to have a bucket of Pop corn along with you while watching Bhool Bhulaiyaa.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Bull Ko Bhool Jao......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bull Bullaiya - this is a pathetic and stupid time waste film. The beginning 20 minutes consist of silly comedy, trying to create a scary atmosphere out of nothing. It is full of psychobabble, unexplained behavior and phenomena (why are rocking chairs rocking, curtains flapping when we know by the end that the real reason is not supernatural), and worst of all there is no good performance. Poor Shiny is sleep walking, Rajpal Yadav has never been more pathetic - and the guy can usually act so well - here completely wasted, Paresh should seriously consider retiring, Vidya is normal in the normal and completely stupid in the abnormal, Akki has to dress up as a weirdo to cue us into his comic role, and then in dress pants and shirt to tell us he is now a respected psychiatrist. In fact I do not think any one has really acted well in this entire film. The stars of the film are the sets and cinematography.Any one with half a brain and some logic will know that:1. Supernatural Hoo Haa is basically BS. 2. No one can start talking in a language they never knew or performing acts they were not capable of just because they are possessed or have dissociative whatever disorder. You cannot create something out of nothing. 3. To scare people you need more than silly people jumping out of their skin on screen. 4. The confusion between psychiatry and Tantric Mumbo Jumbo is enough to give the audience a disorder - stay away from Priyadarshan films disorder.I cannot believe that people are liking this film. And if I see Akshay again in another weirdo get-up I will ban myself from all his films. Has no one actually gone to a Kumbh Mela? Who thought that disheveled hair, smudged bindi and a lot of smudged kohl can pass for good acting? Akki's pee jokes match up well with his poop jokes from Heyy Babyy. Paresh does a mock mating dance with his wife, Rajpal Yadav is demented for no reason. In fact one person is possessed and everyone else behaves in a demented manner, there is no sanity to be found. Music is not worth talking about. Lets Rock Now Soniye has people in traditional clothing and turbaned heads rocking in a most incongruous manner. There is a road song that is well picturized. Then there is Hare Rama Hare Krishna - too little too late to afford any real amusement.My advice - forget this bull and try to catch a really funny film, Padosan or even Akki's Hera Pheri should do the trick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bhool Bhulaiya gives us what it does not promise. The trailers pronounced the flick to be a comic caper, prompting parents of infants to throng the theaters with their little ones in tow. What the film turns out to be is some different dish altogether. It is what the fine print said all along, a psychological thriller. Just that the fine print should have been the meat and the comic reliefs the periphery. However, to judge the film in isolation from the trailered promise, it is not a bad production at all. The first half is dedicated as a build up for the second half with the director attempting to keep the audiences involved and entertained with slapstick comedy which more often than not falls flat. There is the usual bathroom humor and situational confusions which may elicit a tickle from the infants spoken about above but are given a pass by the adult members of the audience. Have no illusions about it, the film is whole and sole about the second half. The entry of Akshay Kumar brings in a new life into the sagging build up and one realises that for all his faults and shortcomings, the guy really does have screen presence. The audience practically stirs out of it's slumber the moment Dr Aditya (Akshay Kumar) starts to unload himself on the movie. Even the humor starts being, well, humorous. The suspense builds up with twists and unpredictable turns and though you may have a strong opinion on the eventual guilty party, the motive is well hidden throughout. Overall BB is a reasonably well woven tale about a stereotyped village with it's share of village belles and bumbling idiots, a family of earstwhile royals, superstitions and supernaturals, the way we know it. Recommend a watch. And yeah, do leave your kids behind lest they scream and rant at the horror scenes and spoil the show for those around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the luxury of seeing this movie with no expectations, the non-stop factory that priyadarshan runs is turning out one lacklustre comedy after the other, and the quality is only deteriorating after every shift.But this was not copied from an English movie (unlike all his earlier films which were supposedly remakes from south films but the fact that the south film was a remake was ignored), and the stellar cast that all his films contain is always good for some entertainment.The movie started out well enough with the obscure town in Rajasthan with some good cinematography (good because with a canvas like rural India/Rajasthan its impossible not to have good visuals).The regular cast returns with a few new faces namely Namely Vidya Balan, Shiny Ahuja and Amisha Patel. Shiny Ahuja gave a convincing performance, while Amisha Patel could well have been a bystander, VIDYA BALAN LOOKED HIDEOUS, DRESSED BADLY AND TOWARDS THE SCENES AT THE END CROSSED OVER THE LINE IN THE DISGUSTING CATEGORY, the acting talent may be there but its discomforting to see a 35-40 looking actress doing the role she does.The movie gives us the regular Priyadarshan/Neeraj Vohra comic fare with a twist, after Akshay Kumar enters there's a bit of weird humour not unlike the one seen in sleepy hollow but half the flair.Yet the first half is enjoyable maybe even good, as you wait in anticipation for the climatic second one.The regulars do what they do, ie give stellar performances with varied forms of humour and drama ranging from the downright corny to the brilliant. SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE COME TO EXPECT FROM PRIYADARSHAN, BESIDES CHURNING OUT ORDINARY COMEDYS.The mystery have been all to predictable for me (got in 5 minutes,i got the motives wrong though), but by the interval most people had the same idea. The second half takes a steady and rapid decline, till it reaches a point which is equivalent to running of a cliff. The last half hour (i think felt like 1 hour) is to pathetic that after a long time, i actually felt a headache. When i cried out in frustration (and much to the annoyance of my parents "Woh Jo Bhi ho bhaad me Gaya Pichar Khatam Karo Bh!@@(*d" the whole theater mirrored their agreement with a bout of laughter that far exceeded any in the movie.There are some really nice scenes specially in the earlier half like Akshays entry, Paresh Rawal pleading with the pseudo ghost, etc etc.But these scenes were supposed to be the filler for what was supposed to be a climatic, mysterious and maybe even funny second half, but ended up being the best part off this otherwise pathetic movie.Some social issues were touched but these were lost in confusing end.Even though Priyadarshans movies are degrading with time, this is the first time that a pathetic last half hour is making me tell people to avoid this movie unless they are hardcore fans.Watch at your own risk.-s pathetic last half hour, Vidya Balan, confusing and deteriorating second half, bad songs (the title song isn't being shown in many theatres).+/-s mystery or comedy ???probably fails at both.Have we had too much of Akshay in the same roles???.+s Stellar regular cast, some good scenes, good technically, lovely visuals.total 3.5/10 (and not factoring in my low/no expectations because any higher rating may be misleading, i cannot emphasize how bad the last half hour is, to add to that now we have people complaining about the Buddha statue so Adlabs isn't showing the title track.)</fullReview>
