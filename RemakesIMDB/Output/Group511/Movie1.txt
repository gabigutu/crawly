		<fullReview>When a Stranger Calls boasts the scariest opening in film history. Wes Craven completely ripped this intro off in Scream. It's that good. Too bad the rest of the film isn't. It goes completely downhill after the beginning. It's so scary and has such a tense start that you can hardly watch it without holding your breathe. My girlfriend couldn't watch it period. She had to turn her head and keep asking me when it was over. It's very subtle, slow, and deliberate, and very frightening. The rest of the film can't live up to the energy generated by the beginning. But still, I recommend this because the beginning alone is better than most fright flicks in their entirety.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have you checked the children?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"When a Stranger Calls" is a somewhat entertaining horror-suspense-thriller that starts off great, loses steam in the middle, then comes back for a good finish. The beginning of this movie is outstanding, with babysitter Carol Kane receiving obscene phone calls from an unknown maniac. This is far and away the best part of the film. It's scary, creepy, and downright eerie. But it doesn't sustain that level through the entire film. The mid-portion of the movie is rather dull, featuring a few lazy supporting performances. But "When a Stranger Calls" redeems itself with a nail-biting climax, even though the conclusion doesn't top the film's opening in terms of scariness. Carol Kane and Charles Durning are good in the roles of the terrified babysitter and the private detective searching for the killer when he's on the loose. "When a Stranger Calls" is not a great horror movie but a good one. And its better than the cable-made sequel that came out fourteen years later, "When a Stranger Calls Back". *** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Horror Creep Fest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like to watch horror films to challenge your comfort zone and get some real chills running down your spine. When A Stranger Calls(1979) is a pretty good bet to do the job. This film builds its tension quite well, partly by using well chosen and well placed music to increase the creepiness. Rather than resorting to needlessly overdone gore; This film relies mostly on the old tried and tested power of suggestion to mount most of its suspense and scare factor. A much more effective method in my view, and there is strong evidence of this here. Make no mistake, this film is no masterpiece. It has its flaws. I found a couple of parts pretty unconvincing. Such as how easily John Clifford is able to convince Mrs.Mandrakis to let him in, and then help him. The execution of this part is a little weak. However that really doesn't take away from the films eerie feel and overall horror enjoyment. The film is pretty well paced, and kept leaving me wanting to see what was going to happen next; Where as many other horror films leave me not even caring what happens next. The acting here is pretty solid all the way around, and the direction is decent. Usually I would rate a decent film like this, with a couple of somewhat unconvincing parts a 6 out of 10. However this film is definitely very effective in what it sets out to do. Which is of course to give the viewer some real creepy thrills. So I find it hard to give this any less than a 7. I got from it exactly what I had hoped. It could have been a little better in some areas, but all in all it's a pretty solid film. So as far as horror films go, this is in the upper echelon in my view.Note: I only decided to watch this film based on an interview I saw with actress Jennifer Connelly on The Late Show with David Letterman. She basically said that this film scared the crap out of her. So being the film nut I am, I figured it was worth a look. And it was, so I owe thanks to her.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great opening and ending--lousy middle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A girl (Carol Kane) is babysitting one night. She keeps getting phone calls from a guy saying "Have you checked the children". (They're upstairs sleeping). The phone calls continue. She gets nervous (and never checks the children). She calls the police. They trace the calls--they're coming from INSIDE the house...This was a big hit in 1979 with teenagers--despite the R rating kids were let into this one. It does have a great opening 20 minutes and a pretty scary ending--but the middle is dull dull dull. It involves the killer (well played by Tony Beckley) stalking an older woman (Colleen Dewhurst slumming) and a police detective (Charles Durning--also slumming) after him.Good performances save the middle half from being totally unbearable, and there is good direction from Fred Walton. But all in all this is a mediocre thriller. Still, I'm giving it a 7 for the opening, the closing and the acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Scary and Real Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jill Johnson (Carol Kane) is babysitting two children, when a stranger insists calling her in the phone, asking her to see the children in the upper floor. She decides to telephone to the police, to trace the phone call. When the office on duty tells her that the call is from inside the house, Jill panics. Seven years later, the maniac escapes from the asylum and the private investigator John Clifford (Charles Durning) is hired by the father of the children to kill the man. It is almost impossible to write a summary of this thriller without spoilers, so I have to stop here. A couple of days ago, I watched 'When a Strange Call Back', a type of sequel of this film. I was amazed with the beginning of the story, one of the most scary I have ever seen. Yesterday I decided to see 'When a Stranger Calls' and it is indeed a tense and suspenseful thriller. The situation through which Jill passes is amazingly real and scary. When the police officer tells Jill that the phone call is from inside the house, he heart of the viewer 'jumps'. This part is too frightening. The greatest problem in both movies is the continuation of the story seven years later (five in the sequel). It breaks the tension and the viewer gets completely lost about what happened to the characters. With a better sequence, this film certainly would be considered a classic. The story is excellent, and the performances are very realistic. In my opinion, the famous 'Scream' copied the introduction of this film. In Brazil, it was released on VHS only, and the quality of the image is not good. It deserves to be released on DVD. It is really worthwhile to watch this film. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): 'Mensageiro da Morte' ('Messenger of Death')</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie still scares me. I have babysat before in someone else's house and i remember getting the creeps with every little noise i heard. This is the ultimate realistic scary movie. You can easily put yourself in her place, unlike many of the horror films we see today. We had a discussion about this movie today (Dec. 2005) when we talked about a coworker wearing clothes the same color as the walls and her blending in... it brought up the discussion about the stalker painting himself to blend into the wall. I am excited to see that it will be remade next year. i hope it is just as good as the original. I can't wait to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pristine premise stretched until flabby</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Problematic suspense thriller. The short film this is based on, which milked a pristine premise for maximum tension, worked. As a short. This film, directed by the same director as the short, used the short film's premise as its first act. Beyond that, it stops working.A babysitter receives a series of harassing phone calls -- "Have you checked the children?" -- that she learns are coming from INSIDE the house. THAT is the film's big surprise, and it comes at the twenty-one minute point. The film's second act involves the search for the phone caller who, we learn, killed the babysitter's charges.The phone call revelation was stolen from "Black Christmas" and used again in Wes Craven's "Scream". It's a good, creepy one, but it's a one-note revelation that you can not hang a feature film on.The storyline involving detective Charles Durning (who is always good) and Colleen Dewhurst is pedestrian at best. Durning's search for the killer and his connection to Dewhurst grinds the narrative to a halt. Although the third act amps the suspense up once again, it comes to late to rescuscitate the corpse.Carol Kane, the excellent actress from the underrated "The Mafu Cage" is terrific as babysitter Jill Johnson and makes us believe in her fear.Fred Walton's almost shot-for-shot remaking of his accomplished short film is suspenseful and Hitchcockian in the extreme, but nothing can change the fact that the premise had nowhere to go after it had blown its first act wad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a stranger calls has the most terrifying opening I have seen. It starts with the babysitter and the caller,we learn that the caller is calling from the upstairs bedroom inside the house.The babysitter gets away and the killer is caught.Years later the killer escapes,the babysitter (now living a happy life) is now a fully grown woman. One night the killer comes back to stalk her,and then she's in more danger than before.The opening to the film is brilliant,it mounts more suspense than I have ever seen.The middle just goes downhill and gets boring.As the film approaches the end,audiences will be dissapointed,because it doesn't work as good as the beginning but in my own opinion I would say it still shows off that little scare. I would reccomend this but I have to make a strong warning,don't watch while babysitting or don't watch it alone.I rate 4/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shame about the middle part.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into When a Stranger Calls, I was expecting something alone the same lines as Black Christmas and Halloween, due to the film's relationship with those movies. I'm not a massive fan of either of those films, but I recognise Black Christmas as an important film for the genre, and if When a Stranger Calls turned out to be as good as that; I wouldn't be disappointed. It didn't turn out to be as good, however, as despite a great opening; the film never reaches any kind of high, and on the whole; this is just another slasher. The film starts out with a babysitter looking after someone's house. It isn't long after her employers have left that she starts receiving odd anonymous calls, and it isn't long after that before she discovers that the calls are coming from inside the house! It's the classic babysitter story, and if the film had stuck to this story for it's entire running time; I would have liked it a lot more. I realise that it would have been difficult to make a feature length film with just a girl, a house and a madman upstairs...but films have been made with less.Instead of following the babysitter story, we are presented with a story taking place seven years later. The killer has escaped from a mental hospital and is now roaming the streets, with the detective from the original case on his tail. While this film never actually becomes boring, the chase plot never gives the audience enough tension or intrigue to keep interest levels high, and if it wasn't for the smart, but abrupt, ending; it would have been hard for me to write this review without calling the film a failure. In the beginning, the film has all the elements needed for a successful horror movie in place. It's got atmosphere, suspense and a plausible plot line, which is why I cant understand why the filmmakers would ditch this for the plot that they decided the movie should take. There is very little (if any) gore in the film, as it's obvious that the director preferred the 'Halloween' approach; but this doesn't work in the film's favour as this film isn't interesting enough to not have any gory sequences. On the whole; When a Stranger Calls has a good beginning and a good end. The middle part is wholly forgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seminal Slasher Flick? It depends on who you ask...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original WHEN A STRANGER CALLS, a movie that was evidently not made for television but might as well have been, is considered by many to be one of the first and most popular slasher flicks out there during a time when they were the latest thing in horror. Some will categorize this along with BLACK C HRISTMAS and HALLOWEEN. Nevertheless, I found it to be more of a psychological thriller than a traditional slasher flick, as only two people are "slashed" in the entire movie (something which occurs off-screen).The opening sequence is a dramatization of an old urban legend; a babysitter, in a strange house all alone, begins receiving anonymous phone calls from some guy who keeps saying "have you checked the children?" over and over in a creepy pervert voice. It turns out the harassing phone calls are coming from within the house, and the children have already been brutally murdered, leaving the babysitter in hysterics by the time help finally arrives. This sequence is actually well done, and is very much in keeping with the slasher norms. Carol Kane, certainly no teenager at this point, does an amazing job as Jill Johnson, the tormented babysitter.Then seven years pass, and we learn that the slasher, an Irish immigrant named Curt Duncan (Tony Beckley) has escaped from the loony bin. Detective John Clifford (Charles Durning) is put on the case, and he begins tracking Duncan with the intension of killing him. From this point on, the movie departs from the slasher genre, and becomes something more akin to a crime drama. We are shown the life of the killer as he struggles to survive without money or shelter with the cops on his trail, making him an almost sympathetic character. Eventually he starts making phone calls to Jill Johnson, now Jill Lockart, and the panic begins anew.WHEN A STRANGER CALLS is, by no means, a terrible film. It is well made and the acting is quite good. Most people who rent or buy this expecting a slasher film may, however, be left disappointed. As a thriller, it does work very effectively, even when the music makes one anticipate the words "The Audience is Listening" across the screen. Perhaps thinking of it as an hybrid slasher/crime drama might aid in its viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Near-classic suspense film takes some inspiration from such classic horror movies as Black Christmas (1974) and Halloween (1978), and proves to be a worthy follower!Lunatic terrorizes babysitter via telephone, now years later he is on the loose again. Will a private investigator be able to stop him before he reaches his earlier victim's family?While the mid-portions of this film become a bit more of a crime-drama, the opening sequences and the grand finale are truly scary! Director Fred Walton builds atmosphere and extreme tension so well that even as we can guess the out come of a scene it's still terribly intense! Walton keeps the story intriguing through out, delivering some awesome moments of edge-of-your-seat suspense. Also adding nicely to the moodiness of this film is the eerie music of Dana Kapraff.The cast is very good. The great Charles During does a solid job as the PI. Carol Kane is captivating as the babysitter turned victim. But perhaps best of all is the late Tony Beckley. Beckley makes for a completely scary madman, but oddly enough manages to create some sympathy for his character!When a Stranger Calls is a too often over-looked thriller. For those seeking a film with some terrific suspense, it's an excellent choice!Followed by a television sequel in 1993.*** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When A Stranger Calls has received a lot of hype for having the scariest opening in horror movie history. I will admit it was tense and chilling and it set up the movie perfectly. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is not scary. The 50 or so minutes turns into a crime/drama about the cop (Charles Durning) chasing the psychopath (Tony Beckley) who has escaped after being locked up for seven years. The last 15 or so minutes focuses on Jill (Carol Kane) who was the babysitter that was terrified seven years earlier and her reunion with the psychopath. Unfortunately, the climax is somewhat disappointing.The acting is fairly average and the music is the typical "dread" music. The movie had so much potential to be one of the scariest horror movies made, sadly, it descends into a crime/drama that never really gets any better.2?/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"When A Stranger Calls" is a thriller that, while not perfect, does overall deliver a lot of chills. The opening sequence is the most memorable part - while you will guess the surprise twist in this segment long before it happens, the sequence is masterfully directed so it comes across as creepy all the same. The climatic scene, while a little short, also delivers a jolt.While the opening and closing are well done, the middle portion of the movie has a problem. It's not only very slow, not much happens to advance the plot. Still, this middle segment often has a moody feeling that fits well with the rest of the movie, and Tony Beckley's performance as the psycho is a good one.By the way, while the movie was rated "R" when it was first released, most viewers in this day and age will find that rating a little harsh. By today's standards, the movie deserves a PG-13 rating. Maybe even a PG rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not such a bad film, just a few problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had very high expectations from this film because of the description of the story and title, it felt like this was going to be like "Black Christmas" or "Halloween", but it didn't feel like those films at all. What this film tried to do was get two films and fuse them into one but my problem is the middle bit.Those of you who have seen it will know exactly what i am talking about. First off i'll go through the story.A babysitter comes to look after a mother and father's children but then she gets funny and anymoynis phone calls from a creep who's decided to stay in the sleeping children's bedrooms. He soon kills them and he is sent to an insane asylum. That's very much like Black Christmas. Then it starts taking the Halloween root as 7 years later, the maniac known as Duncan escapes and goes and starts his bloody rampage. He first stalks a woman and then he goes after the same babysitter (now married) harassing her again.I'll talk pros: First off the music is chilling, scary, awesome and undeniably suspenseful. It truly sets the tone for this film. The acting is fairly good with all actors doing a marvelous job. The kills are perfected well as there is no blood and none of the kills are even seen. Except only a little blood in a bar fight. Overally all these elements kept the film going.Now the cons: I do not understand the middle bits at all. Why is he stalking this random woman, what is her purpose, his? What has this got to do with the plot, why couldn't we just have him escape and go in search for the girl/babysitter before???? Not sure why. Also the killer is supposeosbly a Michael Myers or Billy Lenz, why is he so soft. Like he begs people for money, instead of killing them???? Why didn't he come back after that guy hurt him???? These aren't major, major problems, but these are things I would like to know. Having these unnecessary bits in the middle sort of went off of the while Halloween copy concept thing. One thing I'm happy about is at least the suspense was kept on.Anyway, i don't mind this film, I like and don't like things about it, but overall it was a good film and even if it's not the best slasher out there, and most of the film doesn't stay true to it's title, it still delivers average points.6.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hey, did you know...the middle part drags!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah, that's news. I guess everyone can agree on that. It is painfully obvious that the introduction was a separate short before it was decided to turn it into a full feature. While the beginning and the end are somewhat tense, I never got behind this supposed classic from the onset. Nothing seemed realistic to me. (spoilers, for details) Like, turning the lights off when you are scared and waiting that long to finally "check the children". Sure, she was not supposed to wake them, but I doubt her screaming on the phone had less potential disturbing their sleep. It seemed artificially drawing tension. Plus, back in the day of no cell phones, when a creep kept calling you, at least you knew he wasn't in front of your doorstep. That said, I found it completely illogical that the guy was calling from inside the kids' bedroom... Then, the middle part...it doesn't service your scary movie if you show how pathetic the killer is. In fact, I thought there was a twist coming and it was the detective, who did it, having this guy picked as the fall guy he blackmailed or threatened to play the caller. I think I would have liked that more, no matter how contrived it would be. This part was an obvious extension of the short and felt like it each passing minute.When we go back to Jill, this is probably the most interesting act of the movie. The scenes in the restaurant are effective. Coming full circle is kind of poetic. The ending was predictable, but played out nicely, at least. Out of the "Holy Trinity" of creepy-strangers-calling-movies, the other two being Halloween and Black Christmas, I still prefer the latter (incidentally, the oldest one of them).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Terrifying Horror/Thriller That Will Make You Sleep With The Lights On!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"When A Stranger Calls" is one of the creepiest movies I've ever seen. It's so scary, I get the chills just thinking about it. Two reasons why i's so scary is that it could happen and the film's opening is extremely intense.The first act: Ordinary girl next door Jill Johnson is babysitting for the Mandrakis family. The children are upstairs, tucked safely into their beds. And Jill is able to make herself feel right at home. Until the calls start. At first, Jill isn't worried. But then the caller asks her "Have you checked the children?" over and over again. Scared out of her wits, Jill calls the police and has them trace the call. Jill is shocked when she finds out that the calls have been coming from inside the house!!!! The second act: After seven years, private detective John Clifford is hired to catch Curt Duncan, the stranger from that fateful night. Curt now roams the street, taunting a high-strung woman named Tracy. After Tracy has her encounter with Duncan, he disappears.The third act: Jill is now a mother of two kids and a loving wife to her husband, Stephen. She has forgotten about that night seven years ago, and is living a happy life. Until Curt Duncan tracks Jill down and the calls start all over again.The original "When A Stranger Calls" is very underrated. Some have said that the movie falls downhill after the opening. But that's where they're wrong. The first act is absolutely bone chilling. I was biting my nails, it was so scary. The second act is very suspenseful. Not scary, but suspenseful. Then, the third act returns to the wonderful effectiveness of the first act.The cast is amazing, especially Carol Kane as Jill. Her eyes are so wide and her screams are so gut-wrenching. She should've gotten an Oscar. Charles Durning is very good as John Clifford and so is Colleen Dewhurst as Tracy. And Tony Beckley is really frightening as Curt Duncan.Another thing that keeps the movie scary is its amazing score by Dana Kaproff. The music is so foreboding and adds a lot more tension and dread to the movie.Director Fred Walton would go on to make "April Fool's Day," an 80s slasher bomb. It's too bad, because here, he has a lot of talent. "When A Stranger Calls" is very well-made, and Walton knows that every horror director should never let the viewer breath. This movie created a gigantic sense of claustrophobia.People need to realize that there's a lot more to "When A Stranger Calls" then just a fantastic opening. It stands on its own as a great thriller with tons of suspense, a remarkable cast, and a disturbing score. Avoid the remake at all costs. "When A Stranger Calls" is the invention of a masterful modern horror/thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great beginning, good ending just skip the middle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is quite a difficult movie to review as it's almost two different movies in one. The opening sequence is highly effective though and is considered a classic example of the horror genre, but after that this movie takes a rather strange twist in the second half, that almost completely abandons the formula, and doesn't pick up again until the ending.The plot = well as everyone should know by now, the classic baby sitter getting crank phone calls, from the man upstairs, but she manages to escape into the arms of the police, while the man upstairs has murdered the children and is sent away to an insane asylum. But many years later he escapes and attempts to live a normal life, by stalking another woman, until he finds the babysitter from years ago now married and with children of her own.There are some good things about this movie, namely the opening sequence as i've said before, it was highly effective and scary as hell, with really decent performances, from Carol Kane who plays the babysitter brings a real quality to this movie. Where this movie goes wrong though is the second half, when we're introduced to the man upstairs, it drags on for way too long and quickly becomes boring, like when he attempts to stalk the second woman, which quickly becomes pointless and goes absolutely nowhere, but the movie picks up again when Carol Kane is reintroduced to the movie, that's when the effectiveness picks up again, with a brilliant shocking climax which had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.All in all a decent enough forerunner, with a great beginning and end, just skip the middle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic 20-minute short buried in a 90-minute mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first 20 minutes of this film have been copied or parodied so many times in the last 30 years, it's hard to look objectively today at the impact of this sequence. However, even stripped of pretensions, the first act of When A Stranger Calls remains one of the most harrowing and effective horror stages ever set.The simplicity here is key. The voice on the phone that haunts Carol Kane throughout is soft-spoken, not wild and animalistic. Therefore, the words themselves become the source of horror, and this works just fine, since a malevolent timbre asking "have you checked the children?" suggests more menace than film-makers would dare put on the screen. The camera work is likewise sparse: shots of Kane from strange angles that seem to show the camera poised in the darkest, most oblique corners of the house. We don't quite know who is watching her, or from where, but the tension as we are led through the process of discovery is palpable. Kane's performance isn't hysterical or unrealistic, it's actually just as deliberate and cautious as the pacing of the terrors to come. The way director Fred Walton pulls us through this opening salvo is genius, and it's especially fitting that we never lay eyes on the mysterious caller, and that we never get to "check the children".Given the sublime execution here, it's not surprising that the remainder of the film fails to match the impact of this opening sequence. What is surprising is that the largely inept and dull hour that follows was directed by the same person. In fact, the rest of When A Stranger Calls is so disjointed and unnecessary that we can't help but guess that Walton made a brilliant short film and succumbed to the pressure to flesh out the piece into feature length to ensure that more eyes would see it.Our second act takes the film into a myriad of directions, none of which ultimately have any point when we reach our finale. Frankly, the stories tacked on to the initial shocking narrative are uninteresting, and despite a great performance from Colleen Dewhurst and a nail-biting sequence in her apartment, the entire middle section is almost tedious enough to make us forget how floored we were by the first segment. In fact, it isn't entirely clear why Dewhurst is even in the film, since she has nothing to do with the opening set-up, nor the climax that concludes it. She simply disappears as we enter the final act, after we've invested 40 minutes of screen time in developing her character, and we're left wondering if we didn't wander into a different movie by mistake. Given that nearly half of the film's running time is devoted to the entirely useless series of subplots found in this awkwardly-paced middle act, it's no wonder that When A Stranger Calls isn't regarded as a classic, despite its immeasurably influential opening number.Ultimately, the film isn't sure what it wants to be. Is our focus on an overweight ex-cop seeking justice for the horrific murders he was unable to stop seven years before? If so, the presentation of this is so banal, it isn't even worth making a movie about. Charles Durning has less screen presence than the telephone Kane answers so many times early in the film, and his rote performance is about as nuanced as that of the couch Kane sits on. Maybe we're supposed to root for Durning as a hero, but the viewer can't help but imagine that if our lives depended on Durning saving the day, we'd be quite doomed.Perhaps the point is to study a schizophrenic murderer trying to forge a normal life after bottling up the atrocities that led to his institutionalization? Okay, I'll bite, and this is certainly a lot more interesting than watching Durning show the killer's mugshot to everyone in the city in a vain attempt at pursuit. However, if this is a character study of a psychopath, we're offered very little pathos here. Aside from a brief scene where Tony Beckley remembers his past and breaks down in a homeless shelter bathroom (which, subsequently, is a rare moment of impact during the plodding second act), this element isn't really touched on with any sincerity.70 minutes into the film, we finally rejoin the story we started watching to begin with, and having Kane back on the screen again certainly helps matters, since we feel like we're about to make sense of the lengthy diversion we've just endured. However, despite a great scene where Kane takes a call and hears the dreaded catch-phrase once again, the film's climax is as anticlimactic as the dreadful second act. The suspense generated at the beginning of the film is abandoned for a timid "boo" as the killer finally strikes. Somehow, despite the ineptness he displays throughout the rest of the film, Durning shows up to save the day, and the film sputters to an unspectacular halt. We're given no further explanation of the significance of the film's middle, and we're offered no hint that the film-makers weren't just padding the run time.Every horror fan should experience the original sequence at least once, for sure. But the wise horror fan will have the sense to eject the disc as soon as Charles Durning appears on the screen. It's truly a shame that the film doesn't live up to the promise it offers from the outset, because the first scares of this film are certainly worthy of the attention and emulation they've received. The rest of When A Stranger Calls is only scary when you consider that you'll never get back the additional hour you spent following this road to nowhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is by far the most spine chilling movie i have ever seen. Playing on the simple plot of the "urban legend" the babysitter and the killer upstairs the film in the first 15 minutes is the most terrifying 15 minutes in film history with Curt Duncan (Tony Beckley) menacing young Jill Johnson (Carol Kane) with the same question over and over again "Have you checked the children?". When a stranger calls gets a lot of complaints that the film goes downhill after the first 15 minutes and I'm going to be one of the rare guys who's gonna stick up for the whole film. In my humble opinion, I don't believe that the movie would of been affective if they kept the whole film around the 15 minutes for example Duncan would keep ringing Jill asking if shes checked the children and that would bore the audience throughout the film. It needed the breakdown of the first part to make the ending more significant. I would strongly suggest this film to any film lover, heck I'm even gonna put it on in a bit. I remember watching this with my fiancée shes never hugged up to me that tight since we've watched when a stranger calls. go watch it...... NOW!!!!!</fullReview>

And yes I was a teen babysitter.Those phone calls in the beginning still haunt my thoughts... and the film gets better from there - the last 15 minutes are just as terrifying.Big questions have been raised about how a man can use his bare hands in murder and rip apart the kids. The kids were a 4 1/2 year old boy &amp; 3 year old girl - we are talking about a full grown mad man. BUT this seems to bother some viewers because they are unsure or seriously doubt the could really happen. I myself really don't know if it really is possible.Stalker-murderer phone calls? I do know that the original Night Stalker did make phone calls - so I know this much is possible.This film a nightmare for parents and babysitters alike... there are real life madmen.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective thriller, despite awkward story arc.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When A Stranger Calls does so many things well, that you can almost forgive the fact that acts 1, 2 and 3 don't really seem to fit together so well. The first twenty or so minutes deal with a teen-aged baby sitter receiving anonymous phone calls from a creep asking if she has "checked the children", a question we the audience also find ourselves asking since the kids are upstairs, apparently sick, and she never once checks on them. Being the 1970s, there is no caller ID at the house, and it takes the police a while to trace the call... to another line inside the same house! Yikes! This scenario is based on an old urban legend, and had been used before in Black Christmas. However the encounter is well-filmed and undeniably suspenseful. After a moment of sheer terror, this situation seems to be resolved.The remainder of the film takes place seven years later after the psychotic killer from the the beginning of the film has just escaped the mental institution where he had been confined. The father of the dead children from the first scene attempts to hire the now-retired police detective from the case to track this man down and kill him. The ex-cop, realistically played by Charles Durning, agrees. Finding him doesn't prove that difficult. The eccentric Englishman with no concept of social restraint leaves a trail of fear and bad feelings everywhere he goes. And he sticks out like a sore thumb among the skid row missions of downtown Lon Angeles. But actually catching the man can be a difficult thing for an aging, out of shape former cop. The middle part of the film, dealing with Durning's attempt to find the killer, is its best. The third act just isn't plausible in any sense of the way. Nothing about the film's conclusion is truly possible, and it all basically seems tacked on. I'm sure the killer knows where the babysitter from seven years ago is out to dinner with her new husband.... how hard would that really be to find out?? Truth be told, the film has plenty going for it, particularly in the acting department. The fact that Tony Beckley was never heard from again could only be explained by his death shortly after the film was made. He is terrific as Kurt Duncan, the psycho. Not cold, boisterous, or sophisticated like some arch villain. More nervous, fragile, desperate... even pathetic. But very dangerous. The other characters aren't stereotypes either. They are people. Anyone expecting a better than average thriller will appreciate that. But maybe not the ending so much. 7 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pre-Cell Phone Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I waited to buy my ticket for "When A Stranger Calls," the promotional poster to the right of me included the words: "Unequivocally, the most frightening movie I have ever seen." The critic who made that concise comment expressed well my own response, and apparently that of the others in attendance, considering the writhing and uncontrolled screaming.Writers Steve Freke and Fred Walton created suspense and tension very effectively by getting viewers to live through the potential victim by focusing attention, as s/he did, where they shouldn't. The actors, too, did their job to make certain scenes almost too much to tolerate by reacting believably, either with appropriate fear and panic (Colleen Dewhurst and Carol Kane), or with determination, frustration, and vulnerability, in the case of the seasoned but imperfect detective played by Charles Durning.For the many people who have known life only with phones they can carry in their pocket, When A Stranger Calls may not keep them awake late at night. While they know (but probably take for granted) the incredible capability of an I-Phone, they probably can't imagine the power of a telephone that remained seated on a table or attached to a wall. They don't know what one experiences when he answers a call at 11:30 pm, repeatedly says "hello," but gets something disturbing in return. Did the menace who called to breathe heavily or mumble unintelligibly pose a real threat? Did he know where the victims lived? Was he calling from just down the street? At least the four walls and locked doors of home made one feel protected... until he saw When A Stranger Calls. The story didn't clarify how the psychotic prankster could make those phone calls. A person couldn't pick up a telephone, dial that phone's number, and cause another phone in the house to ring. Occasionally, families did maintain more than one telephone number, but the young children in When A Stranger Calls would not likely have needed a line to themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The beginning is very good with the phone calls coming in. The sinister background score is used to great effect. Carol Kane is really cute. I expected a slightly cheesy thriller with a man who kills children at the center of it all.There are some potentially interesting characters.Charles Durning's character is apparently obsessed with the child killer. But why? There is no real character development to show why he is so obsessed.There is the lonely woman (played by Colleen Dewhurst) at the bar. The child killer becomes obsessed with her. What was her story? We do not know. She disappears after a while.Then we are supposed to feel sympathy towards the escaped child killer. But the child killer's days outside the jail are very uninteresting. And then Carol Kane's character makes a comeback towards the end.So the film starts off as a cheesy thriller with a beautiful babysitter. Then some really adult characters make their entry. But none of it is particularly well developed.The film tries to be many things. But ends up as nothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When a Stranger Calls (1979) 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's amazing about When a Stranger Calls is how much of a tone the first twenty minutes sets for the rest of the movie. The initial babysitter scene performed by Carol Kane as Jill Johnson is actually terrifying. In my opinion When a Stranger Calls, along with Suspiria, have the most attention grabbing introduction, prolific to the horror genre and truly suspenseful. The phone calls in the beginning are terrific and have some chilling lines. After the babysitting scene the film spins into a different direction becoming a cat and mouse chase between a detective and the killer. It's not that the middle section of the film was bad but it really didn't seem to flow that well with the beginning. Tony Beckley, as Curt Duncan, portrayed a great menacing, but at the same time sympathetic villain. There are scenes towards the end in the city that do drag a bit but the payoff is there at the end of the film. When a Stranger calls is definitely an underrated horror film that for me has replay value and nostalgia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing triptych, but as a whole...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came upon this via a slasher list, but it isn't quite that. It starts out that way in the first part, though, and makes perfect use of a house, a babysitter, a telephone and a creepy caller, with a particularly nasty outcome. Then, onto part two (six or seven years later): the cop who showed up at the end of part one now is a P.I. who learns that the culprit of part one has escaped. Here, we also get to know the killer in the setting of a big city, and he meets up with an older attractive woman. The P.I. wants to kill the killer. This whole part reminded me of an atmospheric character study like 'Henry: portrait of a serial killer'; not thát good, but close. Then, the final chapter, in which we return to the babysitter, who is now a career woman, married and with two children. Another strange twist, which makes this a special film, no matter what you'll think of it. For me, it gets a little too much 'out of hand', even if it's still a more than decent final chapter.All in all, I'm still not quite sure what to think of it. The particular slasher / thriller elements seem out of place with the elements of gritty drama which are also there... For now, I'm going to say it doesn't réally work for me, but perhaps another viewing in the future may persuade me otherwise.6 stars, I'd say, but the spot on acting and atmosphere deserve more; 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow middle - but life crawls that way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is notorious for the opening sequence, a babysitter receives unsettling phonecalls in the middle of the night, most reviews recommend it for this opening and find the rest boring. The scene is potent, if not typical now, there are more intense scenes from the time, and yet the rest of the film also deserves to be propped up in horror viewers' estimation.It's telling that only the opening (and very similar last) scenes are recommended, the ones were a pure girl is menaced in four walls by an unseen presence. Inbetween the killer is revealed to be not a masked figment of pure evil but a mentally unstable john who gets a beating, later on we follow a burly PI as he tracks him and not a beautiful girl as she scampers away in terror. I say again and again in IMDb comments that horror is a matter of perception, this is so clearly what haunts in the first scene, the notion that something, a presence, is out there in the same house, that it can be anywhere and conjured anywhere by the imagination, the kitchen, the livingroom, that it comes through the phone to haunt the whole of space. And so a closer look shows that the whole film is in the same vein, a proximity to evil, a premonition and search for it in familiar surroundings, initially (and again in the end) this is just the ordinary suburban home but later opened up to be the whole of New York with its crummy alleys and nondescript concrete, and this is every bit as potent, that the presence of this deranged man somewhere in this city brings out a whole place that is quietly haunted and suffers.One scene marvelously has him hide in a Salvation Army hospital in the middle of the night, we see nameless streets with baleful figures dragging their feet, drunks, hobos, earlier a lonely woman alone in her house after bar-hopping; there's a whole lonely city that aches out there. And I also like how this disembodied presence becomes a damaged human being, and that we become the killing presence seeking him out. The PI (ex-cop) decides to snuff the killer rather than make the arrest, the moral complexity has him lie to him in the end as he tries to calm him down so he can get a quick kill.It is slow in the middle, not as a matter of art so much as dwelling observation. It's not all there, you will have to observe and imagine, but what you will imagine may be something like the horror film Cassavetes never made.</fullReview>

Everything about it(the first scene) was perfect including the pace, the lighting, acting, music, etc. It is a Must Watch. However, the reason this movie hasn't received great recognition is because after this first 20 min scene, it is pointless. My advice? Watch the first scene, and don't bother watching the rest. Despite of this minor setback, this is probably one of the creepiest, scariest things ever made(and I've seen A lot of horror movies). Totally worth it. Trust me. Watch it. Home. Alone.

		<fullReview>Here's one of those movies that takes a few different turns, in one nice pay off with those immortal words "Have you checked the children?". Also in it's time, this horror would of been in the pushing the envelope territory, featuring some bloodied flashback scenes involving child murder. Carol Kane babysits for this family, oblivious to the fact, a killer is lurking inside. Throughout the night she's pestered with calls from an anonymous phone caller, using those immortal words, and some others, where Kane's driven to the point of "No more". She calls authorities and soon the gruesome discovery is made. Fast forward to our looney, Kirk Duncan, who's escaped in a truly believable, genuine, and unnerving performance from our English nutter, who Durning (in a likable and fun performance), once a Detective in charge of that horrible murder scene, now a PI, is tracking Duncan down with intent to kill, so may'be Durning, mentally scarred by the memory of that fateful night, can finally move on with his life, when the scummy psycho's disposed of. You would at first assume this movie was all to take place in one night, involving babysitter and talker/caller, but this is impressively different, although it does lose it's terrifying edge and oomph, when it changes direction, slowing down. This indeed is a palpable martyr here. Nothing equals the first 20 minutes or so, yet still there are moments, throughout, the majority in thanks to our prime performer nutso, and then there's a twist you won't see, made more terrifyingly real by the young actress's great performance. Colleen Dewhurst turns in a great performance as a forties single woman who frequents this dive where Duncan makes a goose of himself, in a pathetic display for companionship. The wuzz of a nonchalont bartender (I know people like this) lets the patrons control the show. WASC has a soft spot with me. A favorite I like to viddy now and again. If you want a good fright, this is one of the better titles to pick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A deranged man harasses a babysitter late at night in 'When a Stranger Calls'. A teenage girl named Jill who is babysitting two children gets obscene phone calls, each time the person asking "have you checked the children?". She calls the police who eventually put a tap on the phone to see who is harassing her. They tell her the calls are coming from inside the house she is in! The man's been upstairs the whole time! It's revealed that he killed the kids... We then go seven years into the future. The killer has escaped from a mental institution and the police officer who was on the case years back John Clifford (now retired) has been hired to find Duncan and kill him. After stalking a woman he meets in a bar, Duncan eventually finds Jill who now has a husband and children. The conclusion is a shocker!'When a Stranger Calls' is like two movies put into one. The first fifteen minutes are some of the most intense and terrifying moments in horror movie history! It's pure horror. But the middle frame feels much more like a cop crime/drama. It basically follows Clifford trying to find Duncan in order to kill him for what he did all those years ago. Duncan falls for a woman who lives in the city, and it's basically him stalking her while Clifford stalks him. Then we get to the conclusion which is just as good as the first fifteen minutes of complete terror.I had nothing wrong with the middle frame of 'When a Stranger Calls', it was well written and acted.. it just wasn't as intense as the first part of the film with the babysitter getting the calls. IT fell flat when compared to the beginning. The acting was good all around, from Charles Dunning and Carol Kane to Tony Beckley as the psychopath Curt Duncan. Overall this is a horror movie that should be seen by all. Despite a bit of a slow middle frame, the beginning and ending are must see! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a "slow burn" crime drama than a horror film?and a very good one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most influential movies of the late 70's, "When A Stranger Calls" is remembered by almost everyone but appreciated by few. I suspect that many reviewers who pan this film as a great 20 minute opening followed by a pointless and "boring" middle probably watched it expecting to see a slasher movie similar to "Halloween." That's not what this movie is about; while it's true that its opening is justly famous, every bit as terrifying and memorable as you've always heard, "When A Stranger Calls" is less of a horror flick than a gritty, suspenseful crime drama who's characters and situations are scary and suspenseful but, unlike most slasher flicks, are also very realistic.The real star of this movie is not babysitter Jill Johnson (played adequately by a young Carol Kane), but rather the killer Curt Duncan. Duncan is not the superhuman killing machine usually seen in Hollywoodland; rather than the "evil personified" mold of Mike Myers or Jason Voorhees, his breed of insanity-and it is made clear that he is indeed completely insane-is the type one may encounter in the real world. He is a haunted shell of a man who is unable to understand or control his actions, and his pathetic appearance would illicit sympathy were his crime not so horrific; this is most likely what a mad serial killer REALLY looks like. No motive for what he's done is even hinted at, but while this lack of back story could easily have made for a 2-dimensional character, the well-written script allows for just enough development to make this killer seem very real. Actor Tony Beckley, who died shortly after filming completed, does an amazing job in this role; his vacant, pleading stares simultaneously invoke both pity and disgust from the audience. The film's other major character is the cop turned detective John Clifford. Charles Durning played roles similar to this in other films of the era, but never with a script as good as he's given here; while the burned out ex-cop is an archetype we've seen countless times, his actions in this film are highly believable, and the intelligence of the story in handling this character, who is complete with a healthy dose of clumsiness and self-doubt, create a sense of realism that is often missing from this archetype. The strongest aspect of "When A Stranger Calls" is the direction, which never allows any one element to go "over the top;" the story and the characters show a realistic sense of motivation and restraint in their actions. This low-key atmosphere, combined with some impressive long takes of seedy, neon tinted vintage Los Angeles streets, create a "slow burn" effect that increases the level of dread as the detective and the killer play cat and mouse. One of the movie's most horrifying scenes comes halfway through, when Clifford tells Tracy (an important secondary character played with superb realism by Colleen Dewhurst) about what REALLY happened "that night"; it's nothing more than a description of the crime scene, yet it is so revolting that even the most hard core audiences may cringe as they think back to what was going up upstairs in that house the night the hapless babysitter received those phone calls. Touches like this, which link the film's crime-pursuit middle to its slash- style opening, create a continuity that leads to a coherent and realistic film.--SPOILER ALERT-- The weakest point of "When A Stranger Calls" is the ending; this is where the previous subtly is abandoned for the more literal "big finish" Hollywood always seems to favor. I always thought it would have been much more frightening if the movie had ended right after Jill receives the phone call in the restaurant, but such an ending would probably have been too "existential" for most audiences. However, this a minor complaint; even with this literal wrap up, there's an still unexpected scare that will make almost anyone jump. Even here, the director showed enough restraint-if not subtlety-to bring a satisfying conclusion to a satisfying film. --END SPOILER ALERT--In the end, the worst thing that can be said about "When A Stranger Calls" is that it is schizophrenic film; it starts as a slasher movie and becomes a crime drama. Fortunately not all viewers see these genres as mutually exclusive, and I have seen few movies that combine the two as deftly as this one does. While it's true that countless slasher flicks of the 80's owe a debt to its first 20 minutes, it's my feeling that some more recent movies ("Se7en," comes to mind) owe a debt to its portrayal of a weary cop determined to stop a crazed killer. If you sit down to watch "When A Stranger Calls" expecting to see a slasher movie, you may be disappointed, as so many of the reviewers that have posted here clearly were. If, on the other hand, you go into it expecting a suspenseful psychological crime drama with an intelligent script, believable characters, and imbued a heavy atmosphere of dread, you will come away rewarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charles Durning as a horror movie hero? Believe it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many films, even the great ones, don't age that well. Either their style or subject matter becomes passé, if not outright laughable, over time. Some movies achieve a timeless quality where no matter what time or place you see them, it feels like they could have been made yesterday. Horror flicks tend to fall much more in the former category than the latter. The amount and intricacy of cinema violence has increased so much that it's very hard for what was shocking or outrageous in a previous era to match the latest excess or perversion. But oddly enough, the best horror films tend to get more interesting as the decades pass because their stories so uniquely reflect changing cultural anxieties and their techniques wind up so repeatedly copied. When a Stranger Calls is a good example of that phenomenon. Boasting an opening so brilliantly suspenseful it's become one of the foundational tropes of the genre, a middle that defies every expectation and an ending that almost manages to be as compelling as the start, this thing is probably better today than when it first came out.Jill (Carol Kane) is babysitting one night for a wealthy doctor and his wife when she starts getting calls from a man asking "Have you checked the children?" In a big, dark house with the calls coming over and over again, Jill's fear and the audience's dreadful anticipation cranks higher and higher until it explodes with the discovery of a child killer and one of the most famous lines in movie history. Fast forward 7 years and the killer (Tony Beckley) has escaped from his mental hospital and ex-detective John Clifford (Charles Durning) is hired by the wealthy doctor to track him down. Having been part of investigating and prosecuting the killer for his horrible crimes 7 years ago and still haunted by it, Clifford resolves to kill and not capture his prey. That search and the killer's miserable existence as a free man make up most of the movie before it loops back around to the now grown and married Jill suddenly getting another call "Have you checked the children" about her own boy and girl and a finale that's almost as good the beginning.The opening scenes of When a Stranger Calls are so thrilling and suspenseful that the whole Scream franchise and a host of lesser work directly flows out of them. A big chunk of the horror formula comes from this film and seeing its fresh and unadorned origins is a treat. The conclusion then recreates the same dynamic to almost as good effect. The middle of the movie is even more striking now than the classic start because it's so unlike what the modern genre grew into.To start with, I'm not sure there's a more unlikely horror movie main character than John Clifford, a middle aged and pot bellied fireplug of a man who spends the entire story running after the murderer instead of away from him. And while the horror formula is all about exaggerating and elevating the villain's aptitude and evil, this killer is cast as a pathetic wretch who gets beaten up in bar and is reduced to begging on the street and sleeping in flop houses and downtown Christian missions. He's almost sympathetic in his inability to function and in trying to avoid getting killed himself. It's a starkly different way to present and handle this kind of violent individual. It humanizes him and that's what makes the finish of When a Stranger Calls so powerful. It reduces the threat from some menacing unknown to a weak, little man and then reminds us how the vicious insanity of such a pitiful being can still be incredibly dangerous. Unlike other progenitors of modern horror, such as The Last House on the Left or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, When a Stranger Calls is notable not just for how its been imitated but for how its path has not been followed by the movies that came after it. This is a must see for hardcore horror fans and I recommend it for anyone looking for a good scare and something more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>These calls were only the beginning...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The much talked about 20-minutes opening sequence totally lives up to its reputation and really is up there as a quintessential stalk-&amp;-slash routine with the great likes of "Halloween" (1978), "Black Christmas" (1974) and what not else prime examples came before them. As well as in years to come, with the opening sequence of "Scream" (1996) riffing on the exact same thrilling chords here. Granted, "When A Stranger Calls" is more about the stalking than the slashing, and thankfully so. The creation of a moody, solitary setting (the empty dark house with the babysitter downstairs &amp; the kids sleeping upstairs), the slowly building of tension (the calls, the checking of the windows &amp; doors) and the short suspenseful climax (the threat established &amp; running for safety); everything is supremely executed. But we're only talking the first 20 minutes or so here. After this, the film shifts in tone &amp; nature, as we skip to 7 years later. What all happens then...? Well, watch the movie and see what you think of it. All I can say is that you can't label this a slasher movie. It manages to successfully distinguish itself from the genre.Director Fred Walton made a successful made-for-TV sequel in 1993, "When A Stranger Calls Back", worth checking out. In 2006, "When A Stranger Calls" got re-made by Simon West, turning it into a less interesting film. But all this is enough to prove that the first 1979 film is a pretty memorable one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"your blood... all over me!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of those movies that could have, should have been a minor horror classic, but instead, it's legacy is the first twenty minute scenes in which babysitter (Kane) is tormented by a creepy caller (Beckett) taunting her with lurid tales of his lust for her blood and begging her to check on the welfare of the children she's babysitting. Unbeknownst to Kane is that the police have traced the calls to within the house. The famous line "the calls are coming from inside the house", then the shadow appearing at the top of the stairs is enough to send anyone's pulse into overdrive. But just when director Walton has you by the proverbials, his grip wanes - it's one of cinema's greatest injustices.Kane was virtually introduced to cinema audiences with his lead role, her petite frame, high pitched voice and naive attraction set her up for a lifetime of varied parts, but no other would be as well remembered as "Stranger". Sadly Beckett's untimely death only a year on denied him the opportunity to capitalise on the exposure his brief fame brought. Ditto Rachel Roberts, the experienced British stage and screen actress who plays the principal treating psychiatrist. Durning and O'Neal are the cops whose initially dismissive attitude to the phone calls suddenly take on more urgency when they learn of the caller's origin.But no matter how many times that first twenty minutes reappears in highlight reels or as a vignette in a horror compilation, the remaining 75 minutes can't be ignored, and they are for all intents and purposes, pretty uneventful. The last fifteen minutes promises to revive the suspense, as Beckett returns to stalk Kane seven years later, now married with children of her own, but even that novel revision fails to resuscitate the flailing picture. While it remains susceptible to comparisons with "Black Christmas", those first twenty are still pure gold in terms of suspense and shock value; just don't expect much of the rest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I could fast-forward through the hour in the middle and not miss any thrills or relevant plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know when I first watched this movie but it must've been when I was young, since I had a fond memory of it being a really good thriller. But, as we all know, memories always tend to be rosier.Not to say this movie is bad. It is at least 6 times better than the 2006 same-titled remake. I say 6 times because I gave that remake a 1.It's like the writers had a very good idea for a thriller, but did not know how to flesh it out into a full movie. As such, the first and last 15 minutes of the movie is brilliant, but gawd, I could fast-forward through the hour in the middle and not miss any thrills or relevant plot.Not to give anything away, but if you've seen the start of Scream, you will already know what the movie's about. It's a phone call... from someone in the house! Which actually sounds kinda lame when I put it that way, but I guess it's combination of accidentally-effective directing and good acting from Carol Kane - who just looks so easily terrorized - that made the start and end of the movie (but especially the former) so memorable. Too bad that there's just enough good bits for an episode of Law &amp; Order than a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When a Stranger Calls (1979)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Fred Walton, the director of April Fool's Day (1986), I Saw What You Did (TV-1988) &amp; When a Stranger Calls Back (TV-1993).A man played by the late Tony Beckley murders two young children whilst repeatingly calling the teenage babysitter, Jill Johnson played by Carol Kane who is downstairs. When the stranger is about to attack Jill, the cops arrive...Seven years later, the middle-aged man - we find out that his name is Curt Duncan, has escaped from the hospital he was put in &amp; tries to start a new life in the city where he meets a middle-aged lady called Tracy played by the late Collen Dewhurst. He is attracted to the seemingly grumpy woman but his attraction soon turns into obsession as he starts to stalk her. Meanwhile, a compulsive cop played by Charles Durning tries to track him down in order to kill him rather than put him away. What follows is one of the most intense finials in the history of cinema.When a Stranger Calls (1979) is an underrated classic, in my opinion. The movie contains a suspenseful, intense, tense, creepy opening. After that people state that 'the film goes downhill'. I can see why. But those stages of the film showcase some convincing acting &amp; that part of the film IS entertaining. These people just get bored easily. The middle of the movie also kinda turns into a cat &amp; mouse cop-thriller which is why some people dislike the flick. Still, the film manages to keep the uncomfortable atmosphere at that point &amp; still manages to be creepy &amp; somewhat scary... The finale is just as good as the opening in which it is suspenseful, shocking...the shock has even become a cliché in the genre of horror. It also contains a haunting ending. This flick involves outstanding performances by all cast members of the likes of Carol Kane, Tony Beckley, Charles Durning, Collen Dewhurst &amp; plenty more. The direction is all right yet it didn't stand out much. But the score.........oh, the score. It was magnificent!The story is partly based on the urban legend 'The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs' &amp; the rest of the story isn't that original either...well there probably the only things wrong about this movie despite the lack of interest in character. Plus, all you get in the gore department is a blood-soaked shirt &amp; some violence but the movie IS a suspense film which doesn't need to rely on gimmicks. So if your looking for gore, this is not the right movie for you.Nice location to film the movie. PS: The movie kept me sweating!If you liked Black Christmas (1974), Halloween (1978), Prom Night (1979) or even Scream (1996) the than you might enjoy this movie.All in all this is a horror/thriller which beats the remake.4 out of 5 stars. If your a horror fan who hasn't seen When a Stranger Calls (1979) yet, than go watch it now! if you can find it that is.........not availiable in Australia yet, but you can find some expensive imported copies.Followed by the TV sequel When a Stranger Calls back (1993) &amp; the remake of the same name (2006).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tense Thriller That Lives Up to Its Reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a Stranger Calls (1979) *** (out of 4)Intense psychological thriller has a babysitter (Carol Kane) receiving phone calls from a stranger asking if she has checked on the children. Flash forward seven years when the psychopath (Tony Beckley) escapes from a mental hospital so a detective (Charles Durning) tries to track him down before he can harm anyone else.WHEN A STRANGER CALLS has become somewhat legendary in the thriller/horror genre due in large part to a nearly perfectly executed opening 20-minute sequence where Kane is terrorized by the mysterious man on the phone. There's no question that this sequence has gone down in horror history as a major highlight but I don't think the rest of the film gets nearly enough credit as it deserves. The middle portion of the film is pretty much a character study as we focus in on the psycho who is out in the streets and pretty much walking about trying to find friends. Even though we know the monster he is, the film at times paints him in a sympathetic light.The middle portion of the film has several thriller aspects that work extremely well including one where a bar woman pretty much gives a cold shoulder to the psycho. Of course, she doesn't know who he is and this helps with the suspense because the viewer very well knows what he's capable of. Even the detective is someone we get to learn about as the movie goes along because we can tell that this is a case that haunts him and you have to think that he dropped off the force and went into a private business in hopes of one day getting his chance to kill this guy.Director Fred Walton does a very good job at managing to build up the suspense during the opening sequence and the problem with a lot of thrillers is that they can contain one great suspense scene and then things just go flat or can never recapture that same tension. Even though the middle portion of this film is more laid back, the director still manages to build up a creepy atmosphere and the viewer is always on the edge knowing that this guy could flip at any moment. The cat and mouse game being played works out extremely well. The film also benefits from a very effective score by Dana Kaproff, which helps add to the tension and atmosphere. Add in some nice cinematography and you've really got everything working right.The performances are also another major plus as Durning is an actor that fits that "every man's" approach. He looks like a real detective. He acts like a real detective. You can look in his eyes and see years of experience and this here just helps the film. Kane is also very effective playing the "scared" female part and there's no question that she helps sell the opening sequence. The film, however, belongs to Beckley who is simply terrific in the role of the psycho. The character actually has quite a bit to do here and the actor perfectly captures not only the evilness that lurks below the surface but as I said earlier, there are scenes where he's mistreated and the actor manages to get some sympathy even when you hate the guy. This certainly reminds one of the performance of Boris Karloff in FRANKENSTEIN.WHEN A STRANGER CALLS is a very intense little gem but there are still some flaws to be found in it. This includes the movie running about five minutes too long and there's also another sequence inside a restaurant where you just want to scream at the Kane character to get up and do something rather than sitting around and crying on a floor. Still, this film deserves its reputation as a real gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Beginning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It gets off to a great start. The first twenty minutes convey a spooky tone, by way of dark visuals, ominous music, and a suspenseful plot. A teenage babysitter (played by Carol Kane) alone downstairs at night in a big two-story house marks time amid uncomfortable silence, punctuated by the living room phone that rings off and on. An unknown man whispers quietly: "Have you checked the children?"After this initial setup the plot shifts ahead seven years, and in so doing quickly loses its tension. The stranger is identified, he appears on-screen, and is now being sought by a private detective, well played by Charles Durning. The detective's tracking leads to a middle-age woman named Tracy (Colleen Dewhurst), a coarse, hard-boiled lady of the streets whom the stranger has taken a liking to. Dewhurst, with that gravelly voice, is a wonderful actress, but she doesn't have much to do here, apart from walking between her apartment and a seedy Los Angeles bar called "Torchy's".The final Act offers some story symmetry. But by now we already know who the psycho is. And an attempt to re-introduce suspense falls flat.Cinematography contains muted colors. Nighttime lighting is very good. Overall, "When A Stranger Calls" is a dark, moody film with little if any humor. Its genre could accurately be classified as "horror", "psychological thriller", or "crime drama". Acting is effective, along with sound effects and background music. But the main problem is a script plot that collapses after the first twenty minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen the remake first and it was very boring. Yesterday night I had the chance to watch the original and it was great. The opening was very suspenseful and very "Hitchcock". It was awesome. The, the middle section was so-so, some scenes were there just to fill the movie and when I though this movie was going downhill: from a great opening to an average middle section it came the ending. Excellent ending. It was truly scary. The acting was very good. You can see Carrie's mother in this movie. Well. I don't want to spoil the movie so go watch it yourself and you'll find out what I'm talking about. I suggest you to watch this movie instead of the remake. 9/10If you liked this movie, I also recommend you: Halloween (1978) and Black Christmas (1974). This movie took a lot from both classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"When a stranger calls" comprises roughly three parts:the first one is good,the second one brilliant ,but the last one is a let down .....The scene when the young baby sitter is alone in the house with a threatening voice on the phone has lost nothing of its strength today.Influenced by previous works such as " Sorry Wrong number" (Litvak) or "Dial M for murder" (Hitchcock ) it inspired the great scenes of the beginning of "Scream (1)" (Craven).And Fred Walton spares us the gore ,he just suggest,much to his credit...The second part,when the murderer returns in the town where "it" happens is the best :never a horror movie (except perhaps Michael Powell's "peeping tom" ) had shown how mortal loneliness can drive a man mad.When the guy tells the frightened woman he wants to be his friend ,he really means it.And in the homeless refuge where men packed into gloomy dirty dormitories ,loneliness becomes even more unbearable. In these sequences,isn't it the paunchy cop the monster?The third part comes as an anticlimax after these extraordinary impressive scenes (I must also mention the one when the assassin ,in the nude,sees his reflection in the mirror and bursts into tears : probably influenced by Fritz Lang's "M").the ending looks like any average horror movie :it could have been so much more.Two thirds of good work ,you make it on the percentages but lose out on the bonuses .But that's still good value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent, genuinely suspenseful and hugely influential shocker.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'When A Stranger Calls' is perhaps one of the great injustices in American cinema. Far from successful when it came out, and still overlooked to this day, it's actually hard to quantify the impact that this movie had on the subsequent generation of movie makers.The story is nothing new, especially by the standards of an age in which it has been bled dry countless times, but the delivery of this movie still takes some beating. Carol Kane is the unlucky babysitter in the now infamous opening sequence. While the scene may be overlong and some of the scares far too drawn out, this scene still holds up as one of the best openings to a horror movie that has ever been made.One of the biggest complaints about this movie is that we don't see Carol Kane for a full hour after the opening number, but I think that this is one of the film's strong points. We could so easily have ended up with a carbon copy of Halloween, but instead we are presented with some of the most interesting character studies ever seen in a horror movie.Most surprising is the film's ability to evoke sympathy for the killer, without ever showing us any redeeming qualities in him. He is presented as sad, desperate and pretty pathetic, but never to the point where we know we are being manipulated. The killer's story is never laid out, nor are we given any information about him other than his actions in the film. In spite of this, Tony Beckley manages to make us pity his character to such an extent that we almost feel more for him than his would-be victims.Charles Durning pretty much plays the same burnt-out-detective character we have seen a thousand times before and since, but brings a quality all his own to it, even if it does feel a little like typecasting at times. A cop who has lost faith in what he does is not exactly a jaw-dropping idea but, as with the killer, we are never smothered with in-your-face character study or extraneous information, and the character works precisely because the film does not sink to patronising the audience or insulting our intelligence.Colleen Dewhurst appears as an alcoholic in whom the killer takes a frightening interest. Again, we are not subjected to playing by numbers or nicely palmed off with a reason for this woman being a lonely, hostile alcoholic, we simply shown that this is who she is. It is rare indeed that a movie can simply allow the audience to believe it's ideas without going into full-on explanations of everything.It is this integrity, and this faith in the audience's intelligence that ultimately allows the film to really succeed. As we are led into wanting to figure these people out, rather than being allowed to simply sit back and enjoy the ride, we find ourselves buying into the story, making the jumps and scares infinitely more affective.In the third act, when we are re-introduced to our babysitter, our emotional investment is torn equally in favour of the three main protagonists, making the final reel one of the biggest pay-offs in the horror genre.The proof is in the pudding, so to speak. There are intelligent, subtle and moving horror movies out there. You just need to know where to look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique and Scary Thriller - Much Better Than The Remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"When A Stranger Calls" begins with Jill Johnson (Carol Kane), who is having a simple night of babysitting for the Mandrakis family. While downstairs doing homework, she begins to receive bizarre phone calls, and contacts the police. We later find out that the calls are coming from inside the house, and that a maniac has been hiding in the children's upstairs bedroom after brutally slaughtering both of them, the police finding him soaked in the children's blood. Seven years later, the maniac who tormented Jill, Curt Duncan (Tony Beckley) escapes from the mental asylum, and begins stalking a woman named Tracy (Colleen Dewhurst) after a violent bar scuffle. Now it's up to Detective Clifford (Charles Durning) to stop Curt before he kills again, and Jill may just be his next target.Unlike the 2006 remake of the film, the original spans over a lengthy period of time (about seven years), while the remake takes place in one evening and just lengthens the first thirty minutes of the original film into one movie. The story for this film is really original and unique - it obviously borrows a lot from the classic urban legend about the babysitter receiving phone calls to later discover they are coming from inside the home - while today that myth may seem overused and clichéd, it's still a really scary concept. The opening for this film was great, and was definitely among the best moments of the movie. Carol Kane plays her part of Jill very well, with a vulnerability and innocence that makes her an easy target for the maniac. Charles Durning is fun to watch as the detective who, seven years after the babysitting incident, helps Colleen Dewhurtst's character when she is stalked by Curt after he is loose from the asylum.The film has a very dark, urban atmosphere throughout most of it, since a large portion of the movie takes place in the inner-city. Director Fred Walton, who later went on to direct the comic horror surprise "April Fool's Day" does a good job crafting the film - the music is really eerie and the long silences and pauses that are used throughout the film (particularly during the first half-hour) are very effective and appropriate for the movie. And the finale with Jill was very well done, especially the final scare that occurs in her bedroom - I should have known that was coming, but it was so cleverly written that it came out of nowhere for me. Definite kudos on that.Bottom line - "When A Stranger Calls" is a scary, entertaining thriller that kept me interested the entire way. Unlike the remake that relied mostly on jump scenes and cheap scares, this film is very well crafted and much better. I easily prefer this version over the remake. If you want to see a serious, good thriller, this film is perfect. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A woefully underrated horror film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'When A Stranger Calls' is the essence of great horror cinema. That's a huge statement so I'll back it up. When was the last time you watched a horror film that had horror in it? I'm not talking about suspense, Lord knows that's hard enough to come by but I mean white knuckles, run up the aisle to get out of the theater - horror? Of all the would-be horror films, maybe a dozen have the goods. 'Halloween', 'Jaws', 'The Exorcist', 'Alien' (not 'Aliens', that's fine on suspense but hasn't a clue about horror) all have the essence of what makes a movie going experience terrifying. And so does this little film starring Carol Kane. I have read a number of reviews that trash this film, complaining that it has a soft middle and no focus and yet, they all agree the opening (and some concede, the closing) sequence(s) are truly terrifying. Well folks, any horror film that can boast a 20 minute sequence that comprises one of the best suspense build ups to a terrifying conclusion goes to the top of my list. The horror film that actually horrifies is as good as it gets, no matter the complaints about a soggy center. (for the record, the middle section is, in my opinion, not as strong as the first and third acts but certainly is watchable and creates a different type of tension) 'When A Stranger Calls' electrified audiences in 1979 because it worked on your nerves, slowly and with disturbing confidence. The score creeps up on you and somehow mimics the audio equivalent to a stomach dropping in dread. The lighting is low key and vignetted creating any number of black shadows for who knows what to hide in. Carol Kane has the face of a silent film star, her large frightened eyes conveying so much that's unspoken. Her building hysteria is timed perfectly. I've never seen a film where audience and lead actor are in such sync. For these reasons and for having probably one of the best lines ever in a horror film, 'have you checked the children?' - 'When A Stranger Calls' deserves to be included in the top horror films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very scary without being gory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"When A Stranger Calls" came out the year after the original "Halloween", and although it is not as widely acclaimed or known, it's just as scary, if not scarier, in a much more subtle manner.The film starts off with Jill (Carol Kane), a young babysitter minding two small children for the evening, the children having already been put to bed for the night by the parents before they leave. She begins to receive anonymous, frightening phone calls with the caller ominously asking, "Have you checked the children?" and "Why haven't you checked the children?" then hanging up. Scared, she calls the police, who at first tell her to calm down, then instruct her to try to keep the caller on the line if he calls again, so the call can be traced. When she obliges and they trace the call, the real terror starts. I remember when I first saw this film, and my reaction to this revelation was unparalleled by any film I had seen at that time.I am trying not to give away too much - if you haven't seen this film, be careful of other online reviews; I came across several that were real spoilers, and without any forewarning.The first part of "When A Stranger Calls" is very fast-paced, then the middle part takes the audience seven years ahead; Jill is now a married mother. The film slows and becomes more of a psychological study; the criminal from the beginning sequence has escaped from the asylum. Along his wanderings he comes across Tracy (Colleen Dewhurst), a tough barfly he fixates upon. John Clifford (Charles Durning), who was the police detective investigating the original case, re-enters the scenario to try to track down the escaped madman, Curt Duncan (Tony Beckley).This part of the movie is slower but much more interesting, in my opinion, and shows how scary a film can be without any real gore factor. Tony Beckley (in his last role) is very convincing as a murderous madman; his careful and understated portrayal make the character Curt Duncan even more terrifying. Colleen Dewhurst's performance as Tracy helps this part of the film move very well (she was always an extremely good actress) and she makes Tracy's toughness, vulnerability, and smarts very believable. Charles Durning as Detective Clifford is a typical part for him, and he handles it well, with his usual street-savvy tough-guy exterior aplomb.The direction by Fred Walton, and the subtly creepy soundtrack help push this film beyond the realm of being just another standard 1970's scream-inducing shock flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when I was 12.. I'm now 16, and through four years of being a horror movie addict, I've never seen anything like When A Stranger Calls. The first half hour was horrifying, and I believe the sequel was one of the only horror movie sequels to live up to the original. I agree that both movies fell flat after the first scenes, but at the end of the first (with Carol Kane in bed after her kids have supposedly been attacked, you know.. eep!) it was just as terrifying.you know what's even scarier than seeing the movie? being a babysitter yourself 4 years later, realizing that the kids you are babysitting live in a house almost IDENTICAL to the one in the movie. lol... that was scary.but horror movies today just don't work. they never have the same atmosphere, and I may get scared in parts, but that's because of the over-dramatized music. have you seen movies like darkness falls and Texas chainsaw (the 2004 version)? good premise, but not half as scary as movies like The Shining, When A Stranger Calls, or other movies from that era. I think the only one I've actually liked from the past decade is The Ring - still not as scary, but they have the tension down. Most movies today rely on gore, and that doesn't make me scream, it makes me feel ill. I hope for a day when a movie can emulate the standards When A Stranger Calls set.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film has more to offer than your usual thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a scene in this film where the killer gets beat up in a bar and that summed up for me why this film works as it doesn't resort to having the "Bad Guy" be just another evil cliché. Story starts out with a young babysitter named Jill Johnson (Carol Kane) who keeps getting mysterious phone calls from a stranger asking her if she's checked on the children upstairs so she calls the police and they tell her that they will trace the call.*****SPOILER ALERT*****After another threatening phone call the police inform Jill that it's coming from inside the house and that she needs to get out immediately but after the police finally arrive Jill is in shock and the children murdered. Seven years later Curt Duncan (Tony Beckley) who committed the murders has escaped from the mental institution and retired cop John Clifford (Charles Durning) is after him. Duncan wanders the streets and hangs out in seedy bars and sleeps in homeless shelters but he does meet a woman named Tracy (Colleen Dewhurst) who feels some sympathy for him but Clifford tracks him down to her and after explaining who he really is she agrees to help catch him.This film is directed by Fred Walton who has specialized in suspense/thrillers but even though he has worked primarily in television this was his first film and directing effort. Some have complained about how this film lags in the middle but even though it does noticeably slow down I thought this was where it distinguishes itself from other films in this genre. Duncan is nothing like the serial killers we usually see and instead we see him get beat up in bars and try to clumsily pick up a woman. He's a loser. A pathetic sort that genuinely has evil thoughts although he's someone no smarter or stronger than your average middle-aged man. Beckley who plays Duncan is excellent and with the believable script he gives a performance that uplifts the material from your standard suspense fare. Ironically, this was Beckley's last film as he died from cancer less than a year later but he did leave with giving a very strong performance that viewers to this day remark on. There is some solid suspense built up and arguably the most shocking scene comes when Kane's character learns where the calls are coming from but the last 5 minutes are also very effective. Effective little film works not only as a thriller but also with the way it handles it's characters without resorting to the usual theatrics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The one line that scared the heck out of me as a kid.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie must have been made with 1 objective-scare the heck out of the viewers-mostly kids. This one was a big deal in my youth. While I can't say that I ever really liked it all that much, I can say that the 1 line, as mentioned by nearly everybody, achieved it's goal in horror history-we've traced the calls. Their coming from in the house.There have been many times since then that as a kid, I'd be home alone and get creeped out if there was a hangup or something. They say a good horror stays with you. I don't think the movie was all that good because there's to much tension but in such an obvious, we wanna scare you type way, you always know your being manipulated. Also there isn't much of a plot other then stopping this guy from doing what he did years before. It's actually not a really good movie but that 1 line gets into your subconscious so that at least makes it a true thriller and a memorable one. I'd give it 4.5 or 5 out of 10 as a whole but definitely more points for the scare factor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>but instead it simply merits a rating of "OK". The opening segment of this film is one of the most thrilling, frightening sequences I've ever seen. Kane is terrorized over the phone by some lunatic who turns out to be a deranged babysitter killer. After this memorable sequence, the movie goes downhill in a hurry, turning into a dumb hour-long segment featuring the killer after he is released from prison. He is beat up in a variety of ways as the filmmakers try to make us feel sorry for this guy, a kid killer and rapist. Finally, the film redeems itself a little with a solid conclusion. When a Stranger Calls could have been a triumph in the caliber of Halloween if it had kept up the strangling, gut-wrenching suspense of the first half hour. Unfortunately, the middle segment (the longest part) does the film in and renders it utterly forgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What could have been a very interesting and intense movie fails to hold its premise to the end. The film has excellent suspenseful moments, especially in the opening scene, then tries something new as the killer is presented in sympathetic light, and the obsessed investigator is more and more demonized. The final shot of this intriguing build up of drama comes when the killer hides from his pursuer in the garbage dump.Apparently it is in this dump where he happens upon the idea to become a killer again while losing the third dimension to his character. Whatever studio executive demanded a "thrillfest" ending be tacked onto this movie instead of following the film's natural progression deprived us of what could have been a very interesting - as well as scary - movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey, Student Bodies, Play Halloween for Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Why haven't you checked the children?" asks the bogeyman caller and that's a damn good question.1979's When a Stranger Calls feels (and was) like a short indie film remade and stretched because of the success of 1978's masterpiece, Halloween. So much so, that this, being my first time ever seeing the film (on 10/2/13,) I was amazed that so much more happens outside the babysittin' house than what we saw.Naturally, any horror fan, like me, has seen clips of Carol Kane answering the phone more than dozens of times. In fact, die-hard horror fans will laugh through this scene because of it being thoroughly and mocked incredibly well in the comedy/horror classic: Student Bodies. But, for a first-time viewer who spends his days avoiding as many spoilers (and reviews) until I actually see the movie, I was completely blown away that 70% of this movie takes place outside Carol Kane's role.Unfortunately, for all of us, frontrunner to the movie's credits, Carol Kane's small-bit story is the most interesting and the rest of the less horror/more mood tale felt, well, too much a stretch. And hence, the short indie film is very obvious when they added in the middle 70% of footage.What we have here is: Carol Kane's babysitting Jill takes to studying vs. ever once doing her job. Okay, well, she studies and answers the phone, repeatedly. Only problem is, when the caller repeatedly asks if the children have been checked in on, she never thinks to do so. I guess the audience is supposed to sympathize with her and her being relentless stalked over the phone, but realists, like me, are angered by the fact she always put herself first.Well, she was proved wrong. Despite being told, she wasn't the intended target, and the kids had been brutally, but mercifully never shown, slaughtered in the beginning by a crazy man. He's easily caught once the police do something about her calls/screams for assistance. And fast forward seven years later??and we get into the dull 70% I was referring to. The killer escapes the mental ward (hmmm, that sounds a tad familiar ? at least when the Friday the 13th creators stated they wanted to blatantly rip-off Halloween, they did their best, and succeeded, in creating a new movie) and he now stalks someone at the complete opposite end of his previous demented craving: Tracy, a middle-aged woman. Enter in ex-cop, turned vigilante, Clifford who stupidly reports his intentions to the police of his desire to find and kill the killer. Naturally, in this movie's realm and not in real life, he's sent on his way to "seek justice" by using Tracy as bait.When that, and the boring 1970's melodrama 70% of the film falls flat, the obvious, albeit completely ludicrous storyline returns to Jill. Again, this sounds all-too familiar. The plot-hole in the Halloween series, specifically decades later in Halloween H20, was how Michael Myers could track down his original target, Laurie Strode. At least here, you have to give them credit for being ahead of the game in 1979 and show how easy it is for this homeless, resourceless and wanted killer to find Jill.I thoroughly expected so much more out of this "classic" that I've heard so much about and saw endless clips of the phone'a'ringing scenes. What I got was a pathetic, useless and thoughtless attempt to cash in on Halloween. It would've been tremendously more suspenseful, and horrific, had they focused their story on Jill, and maybe, just maaaaybe, have her check the kids just once, like she was paid to do.* * * Final thoughts: Now, the cycle's complete. I finally "get" the opening segment that Student Bodies was spoofing. While I always found that opening Student Bodies segment absolutely hilarious, I never knew the full reference to what they were talking about until now. Thankfully, I can continue watching and understanding that great movie more, over this one I'll likely never see again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every Baby sitters Worst Nightmare comes true in..When A Stranger Calls!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The loud shrilly ringing of the telephone, Carol Kane shouting LEAVE ME ALONE and the words THE CALLS ARE COMING FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE! Wow, that made one damn scary scene. I blind bought the original When A Stranger Calls and I do not regret it! The film follows baby sitter Jill Johnson (Carol Kane) receiving frightening phone calls from an unknown caller saying "Have you checked the children?" Eventually Jill discovers that the children are dead and the killer is calling from inside the house! Now 7 years later the mysterious killer breaks free from a mental institution and returns to hunt and kill Jill now a loving wife and mother. Will he kill Jill or will A slick private detective stop him once and for all! Even though I had heard this Urban Legend before, somehow, this still frightened me even though I knew what was going to happen! Terrific opening...but as the film progresses it becomes very...different. For about an hour we see the killer stalking an elder woman by the name of Tracy and the Private Detective is hunting him down...then we come to the conclusion which is the killer coming to get Jill and the film ends on the same note the film begins with...a bang! I actually liked the middle detective hunting the killer part...it kept me entertained..in fact, I have watched this 3 times since I got it and I still love it every time. Great film now in my top ten! My rating-10/10 sheer and unexpected terror!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie's contribution to the genre : the chilling first 25 minutes. That's it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As everyone knows (or may have heard) the movie's first 25 minutes are chilling, intense, because there's a lot of suspense, eeriness, and a feeling of claustrophobia that gets stronger as the minutes run. The movie starts with a chilling score that cooperates to build tension in the forthcoming scene and since then, your attention centers at 100% in the movie.Unfortunately, as everyone also knows (or heard) the movies' next half an hour is as boring as you can get, filled with non sense scenes, dramatic situations that do not add anything to the movie, and pointless dialogues. And as everyone else has mentioned, the movie's last 20 minutes are very good and compensate half the damage that the movie's 2nd. part did. *SPOILERS* I think this is everything you need to know about "When A Stranger Calls": -The snob Mandrakis marriage go out for dinner and leave in charge of their children and home young baby sitter Jill Johnson (palyed by Caro Kane). After they leave she starts getting phone calls from a deranged man who keeps repeating "HAVE you checked the children?!", and "why haven't you checked the children?!". To deal with the situation Jill calls Mr. Mandrakis in the restaurant but she is told that they left "about 40 minutes ago". Meanwhile she turns off the house lights, checks some places in the house, and even has a drink. The calls continue and after Jill gets really freaked and scared, she calls the emergency line that subsequently connects her to the police men that are rounding the area. The goofy Sgt. in charge gives her a stupid advice in order to get rid off the phone calls but Jill breaks on tears and tells him to do something for her because she's really scared. The Sgt. tells her that in order for them to trace the call she needs to talk with the man for about 1 minute. The looney calls again and this time he tells Jill that he wants her "blood all over him" and that he can actually see her. The phone rings for the last time but it's the Sgt. that tells Jillthat the calls are coming from inside the house!(THX sound) And in one of the most tense, nerving, and scary scenes in Horror movie history, Jill tries to escape from the house... ...you know the rest. Sadly enough, the movie falls terribly into half an hour of boredom, pointless scenes, and some unfortunate dialogues. What a way to kill a Horror fan's expectations. We learn that when Curtis (the maniac) is caught by the police, he had the Mandrakis children's blood all over him. He is sent to a mental hospital but escapes 7 years later. Mr. Mandrakis knows about his escape and hires P.I. John Clifford (the same man that locked him down the first time) to once again lock him up. Whatever. The ending pays off the torturing half an hour and has the Mandrakis children killer chasing again Jill after 7 years of the events. He traces her down and sets in her home at night in a chilling and tense ending that obviously ripped off "Halloween" (the mere ending).*HIGHLIGHTS* -The beginning of the movie is the best thing , that's for sure. It's an important and influential scene in Horror cinema. Excellent scene. -What the hell is about with the chasing scene?! I couldn't believe that the same wacko that made the chilling calls run like a girl! Please, Detective John Clifford was about to have a heart attack after running 1 minute after him. -The scene where Jill and her husband are having dinner and suddenly she takes a call from guess who?. Curtis! and he tells "have you checked the children?!". -The ending has a really creepy scene. I have to comment about it. Curtis hides under Carol's blankets taking the place of her husband and later shows up... the scene is really creepy and well done until John Clifford plays Dr. Sam Loomis. Overall, "When A Stranger Calls" is a decent mystery movie. It doesn't have blood (well only in flashbacks) or death scenes (well not until the ending) but manages to create an eerie atmosphere in the important scenes. We never get to know Curtis' intentions for chasing Jill or what was his mental problem or whatever situation that leads his weirdness. That's a minus in my opinion. The soundtrack is excellent in my opinion. Yes, even with the THX sound. The direction is very classy, intelligent, and sets a perfect feeling of claustrophobia and fear. My recognition for Fred Walton, he created a truly scary movie with his direction and that's a merit.Even though the movie contributed with scenes and ideas to the genre, I must say with sadness that it's very overrated. If you haven't watched it, there's no urge to rent or buy it. It's not even recommended for die hard fans of the genre because it doesn't offers the basic existence elements that the genre sets. In my opinion, this movie has to be watched only to witness the chilling opening scene which is the movie's main contribution to the genre. Give it a try if it's on your hands but I'd say that it's not necessary for fans of the genre to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WHEN A STRANGER CALLS (1979)starring: Charles Dunning, Carol Kane, Colleen Dewhurst, Tony Beckley.plot: Jill Johnson (Carol Kane) is a young teenager who is babysitting two children while their parents are out for the night. While the children are fast asleep in bed, a weird man calls repeatedly asking Jill to check the children. She has the police track the calls, and they discover that the calls are coming from inside the house. Jill escapes with the help of a detective (Charles Dunning), but the children were murdered and the killer (Tony Beckley) is locked up. Seven years later, the killer escapes. Even with the Private Eye still tracking him down, he targets Jill once more, who now has a husband and two children.the good: This was obviously made because of the success of HALLOWEEN, with a killer escaping a mental hospital and stalking babysitters with a man obsessed with the killer hot on his trail. But it has it's tense moments.The first 20 minutes are very suspenseful, but obviously inspired by BLACK Christmas. A young Carol Kane is stalked by a crazed killer who wants to bathe in her blood. It scared the hell out of me, but ripped off BLACK Christmas, and was later ripped off by SCREAM.And then the final 20 minutes is also suspenseful with the killer returning to kill Jill and her children seven years later. In these final minutes, the killer shows his rage and it is very scary.I also loved Carol Kane, she's such a great actress and this is one of her better roles.the bad: The middle of the film, which has the killer stalking a middle-aged woman (Colleen Dewhurst) with the Detective looking for him was very dull, and seemed like a 70's cop show. It failed to amuse me, but didn't hurt the film too much.If BLACK Christmas, HALLOWEEN and SCREAM weren't made, this thriller may be a lot better, but those three films were like this only much better.</fullReview>

This should have been kept as a short or just an episode of a horror anthology. Because the rest of the movie is brutal! Totally anticlimactic. We basically follow the "bad guy" around for the most part. Totally lost interest. Nicknamed the killer guy "Ned", because I could care less what his real name was.Just watch the first part, and then move on folks!10 out of 10 for the opening scene. 2 out of 10 for "Hanging w/ Ned"For a weighted average of 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read where this movie actually started life as a short, and people responded to it so well, it was expanded into a full-length feature. If you watch it, you can see how the beginning is strong, the ending is strong, but the middle is just long and boring. They should have just left it as a short, maybe sold it to TV as a Halloween special or something. This movie plays on several of my most personal fears -- babysitting alone in a strange house at night; things in the closet; things under the bed. It's a killer! Don't bother renting it, but catch it if it shows up on TV. Or better yet, rent TERROR IN THE AISLES, a great collection of some of the best moments in horror movies from the 70s and 80s. The best parts of STRANGER are liberally spread throughout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing WHEN A STRANGER CALLS it was one of those shockers that really gets your spin sivering. Carol Kane plays Jill a babysitter that gets strange calls. The person calling askes " Have You Checked The Children? ". I love that line. After many calls, Jill calls Stg. Sacker and tells her that if he calls again he will trace the call. He calls Again. Stg. Sacker calls Jill again and tells her that the calls are coming from inside the house! The children up stairs where murdered. Charles Durning plays the cop inwhich the killer has escaped from a hospital. Soon after. The killer tries to harm Collen Durherst one of those strange actresses. And then he goes after Carol Kane again... Did I mention the killer is played by Tony Beckley who died in 1980 of a Brain Hemorrhage (This is what I was told) Co-starring- Ron O'Neal, Steven Anderson and Rachel Roberts. Followed by a poorly developed sequel in 1993.</fullReview>

Had the film sustained this opening (it would have been difficult) it would have been a classic. (This is also the case with the sequel made 14 years later. Great opening to otherwise routine schlocker). Sadly, it slips into another boring shocker that fails to even shock (except at the very end where this is one good jolt). Too bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had seen the beginning of this movie when i was a lot younger on television. And seeing it as a young kid, i have to admit the opening scene scared the crap out of me. So when i saw this movie on the shelf in the video store a few months ago, they had just re-released it on DVD due to the remake being in theaters at the time i quickly picked it up. When i brought it home i began to watch it, and i have to admit the opening scene, while not as scary as i remember, still holds up as being a truly terrifying moment in the film. Now i wish i could say that the rest of the film held up to what the opening scene had provided for the viewer. After the opening, the film goes around and shows the story of the "stranger" from earlier in the film, who has now been released from prison and wants to start his life over again. Now while this would have been a good premise for a thriller in the drama section, it seems really out of place in the horror section. Watching the "stranger" go to a bar and get in a fight, would be exciting in any other movie, if you actually cared about the character involved and if it helped the plot move forward. But watching the film i wish i had been called by a "stranger" just so i could have had something to do while this sloooooooooooooow movie went on. And while the ending scene did almost match the opening scene in its creepiness, the rest of the movie is not enough to make a viewer sit and watch the rest of the film. So if you rent this movie, my advice is to either not watch it, cause it is really a pretty big waste of your time, or to watch the opening scene, and then fast forward to the ending scene. Maybe at least that would trick you into believeing that you were actually watching a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When a viewer goes to sleep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite a raging indifference to the acting chops of Carol Kane--I still can barely stand to watch "Taxi" largely due to her annoying grate--I decided to give "When A Stranger Calls" a chance. After all, who hasn't heard about the opening segment of this film, where babysitter Jill Johnson (Carol Kane) fields an increasingly sinister series of phone calls imploring her to "check on the children"? Lingering camera shots showing the dark, silent parts of the house highlight the growing sense of fear and despair felt by Kane's character as she bravely stands her ground for the benefit of her employer's children. Several phone calls to the police bring the men in blue into the picture, but will they get there in time if the caller materializes? The ominous shadow on the staircase signals trouble of a most horrific nature, Kane reacts, and the scene plays out to its grim conclusion. And then the real horror starts, the stark, soul shattering horror of watching a movie with a memorable beginning sink into a morass of banality. "When A Stranger Calls" would have worked better as a short, independent film strongly emphasizing its bravura opening instead of plunging into the sprawling mess we get here. Too bad.Years after that horrible night Curt Duncan, the crazed caller, is back out on the streets after a lengthy stint in an insane asylum. Unfortunately, no one told retired detective and now private eye John Gifford (Charles Durning), the cop who was there the night the caller terrorized Jill Johnson. The father of the children brutalized by Duncan hires Gifford to bring the psycho down anyway he can, if for no other reason than to prevent a repeat performance in some other person's family. Gifford agrees to take the case and begins looking for Duncan. "When A Stranger Calls" rapidly descends into boredom from this point forward, as we see Duncan attempting to rejoin society and utterly failing. He ends up in a bar where he meets Tracy (Colleen Dewhurst) and promptly receives a heck of a beating after attempts to ingratiate himself with Tracy brings on the wrath of a beefy bystander. Why Duncan expresses so much interest in a cranky barfly is just one of the many inexplicable questions that arise frequently during the film. You have a better chance of discovering the origins of the Sphinx or learning quantum physics at the age of three than understanding why this movie takes the turn that it does here.As Duncan takes a beating at the bar, Gifford enlists the aid of one of his cop friends, Charlie Garber (Ron O'Neal), now a lieutenant on the force who remembers the bloody horror of that night but hesitates in helping his buddy. This part of the film is interminable, with lots of shots of Tracy strolling through the blasted landscapes of her city in the middle of the night, Gifford pounding the pavement around town trying to track down Duncan, and the former caller's inept attempts to evade capture. Seeing Charles Durning run, although highly amusing and slightly worrisome from a coronary angle, is not enough to elevate this segment of the film. Thankfully, the film returns to its frightening pace at the end, when the now married Jill Johnson once again encounters Curt Duncan. And this time she has here own children to worry about. The scene where she takes a phone call at a restaurant is worth slogging through the preceding sixty minutes, as is the final showdown shortly thereafter.Another let down with "When A Stranger Calls" comes when we finally see Curt Duncan face to face. The guy simply isn't that scary in person. He's older, sort of thin, and looks like your average, every day type of guy and not anything like some former sailor with an insatiable lust for blood. Apparently, the actor who played Duncan, Tony Beckley, died shortly after making the movie. As for Carol Kane, she does a good job playing the eternally frightened Jill Johnson but then promptly disappears for a large part of the movie. Durning sleepwalks through the role of the determined cop John Gifford and Colleen Dewhurst is largely wasted in the meaningless role of Tracy. The performances on the whole aren't bad, but the wooden pacing and uninteresting middle part of the film insured that no performer, no matter how good, could have saved this movie from the doldrums.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Solid Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A surprisingly sold thriller, with performances and production values well above the generic slasher standards that the title implies. The story is actually a little odd, with the tightly directed and genuinely scary 'There's somebody in the house' teen slasher scenario actually acting as bookends to a more conventional police thriller in which cop Durning hunts down the killer. While many find this middle story a little too dull, and guilty of slowing down the incredible suspense created by the opening scenes, I for one found it fascinating, in no small part to the performances of Colleen Dewhurst and Tony Beckley.Together, the two character actors, known more for their award winning theatre work than movies, provide thoughtful and rounded characters with genuine subtlety and depth. Dewhurst's Tracy, a lonely middle-aged drunk, makes for a refreshingly original object of the killers obsession, while the entire movie is almost stolen by an outstanding performance by Brit Tony Beckley. His Curt Duncan is one of the few believable studies in violent psychosis to be found in the horror genre. This isn't a serial killer in a mask, with gimmicky tools of destruction, silently stalking teenagers. THIS serial killer is a socially dysfunctional nobody who drifts in and out of city doorways and homeless shelters, as clueless as the audience as to why he feels compelled to kill.Shot on location in the seedy streets, bars, hotels and shelters of Downtown Los Angeles, 'When A Stranger Calls' possesses an air of refreshing authenticity in a genre awash with stylized theatrics and unbelievable stretches of fantasy. A good film, that delivers way above expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Fred Walton knows how to grab an audience. The first 15 minutes of "When A Stranger Calls" is powerfully effective as we watch a helpless Carol Kane slowly being terrorized by a series of strange phone calls inquiring as to whether or not she has "checked the children". There is a neat twist which I am sure everyone knows anyway but I won't reveal it here. Sadly, the preview of the film (much like the preview for the upcoming remake) gives away the big surprise.After the slam bang opening the film grounds to a dead halt as babysitter Kane tries to get on with her life while detective Charles Durning tries tracking down the killer. The next hour is filled with tedious scenes as we get needless character development when what we want is to be scared. The final sequence does provide one really good jolt which is quite unexpected but you may have already fallen asleep by then.As I said director Walton knows how to grab an audience. When he made the sequel "When A Stranger Calls Back" some 14 years later he had another superb opening sequence (even better then the original's) before it fell apart the rest of the way. If only he could find a way to hold on to his audience with the full grip he applies at the beginning of his films.</fullReview>

The movie also features one of the best openings a movie could have and I'm sure inspired many other 'scary' movies, like Scream, to do scenes like that. I didn't find When A Stranger Calls scary, but the great scene where the 'killer' is basically in the wall, is really chilling and maybe quite scary. It's also another scene which is absolutely brilliant. This is a brilliant movie and a definite classic. I give When A Stranger Calls a 10/10.</fullReview>

Since both stories are very similar, maybe the former ("When A Stranger Calls Back") made more of an impact since I actually saw it before this one.Suspense mounts effectively in several spots in this film, especially when the creep, "Curt Duncan" (Tony Beckley) returns to the house seven years later. Some of the night photography was well-done, too, adding to the suspense.Carol Kane and Charles Durning are fun to watch in the leads.

		<shortDescription>Could have been a 70 minute thriller/horror classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was given the perfect homage by Scream(1996) when the murderer calls Drew Barrymore in the first scene and starts playing a deadly game with her. Here, the babysitter is called by a psychopath who asks her the same question again and again. the scene is long, tense, original and fantastically executed. after this great start, the movie moves down a gear or two when it shows a cat and mouse game between the killer and the detective chasing him. it is this second part which was unnecessary. the scenes are dull. the killer just doesn't come out as menacing as he was in the first half an hour and you see him being bashed in a bar and begin to wonder if you have been watching the same movie. then comes the last half an hour when the movie gets back on track and ends with a fantastic finale. the direction is like the script. taut and nicely done in the opening and the closing acts. the movie could have been edited better and they could have easily trimmed it down to 70 minutes from the present 95 minutes. that would have made this a sure shot cult classic.as it is, this was among a group of movies from the 70s like Halloween, Black Christmas, the Hills Have Eyes, I spit on your grave etc. which were remade. the remake was pathetic. catch this when you have nothing better to watch. otherwise skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK OK. lots of you refer to this movie and the first scene as "scary". Within that definition many of you have voiced disappointment.For those of you who are looking for scary, well, this isn't the movie. Not the first scene and no where thru-out.However.......those who look for the suspense factor of a movie....listen up.Although dated, this movie does pack a punch with the first scene in the suspense department. So much so I would give it maybe 8-9/10.I have on several occasions rented the movie merely to watch the first scene. Many of my friends who watch it for the first time become mildly to moderately upset when I stop the movie after the scene.I cant however give the remainder of the movie more than about a 5/10. I find it so unenjoyable that I prefer not to even say much more about it.For those looking for a decently well made suspenseful moment, rent and watch the first scene of this movie.......then promptly turn it off. :) Look at it as a short film.....enjoy it then move on.Ditto this comment</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fear factor....'check the children'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the comments of 80 responses and eight pages is a clear manifestation of the impact of When a Stranger Calls. 'have you checked the children', the line itself declares the parental nightmare that makes the blood run cold and slow. i'm old school, and a writer for years, who believes the 'suspension of dis-belief' scenario. Aliens, Predators, War of the Worlds may pull the trigger of some folk, but, the stark reality of stalkers, gang-related violence (Training Day) gets me every time. i will not debate the opening minutes of Stranger was one of the most edge-of-the-seat moments ever, nor how the movie slows a bit and the sudden ending thrills some and lets others down. but when the phone rings, "have you checked the children". you don't do it better than than that. Kirk Duncan is a frightening man. true. in the bar with Tracy (Colleen Dewhurst), and when he goes up to her apartment! the chase in the mission, and the determination of Cliff (Durning was brilliant), despite of his age and weight. the remake was good, and had more than a few moments, but it cant touch the original. like Cape Fear with Gregory Peck and Nick Nolte...Robert DiNiro and Robert Mitchum. some things you have to leave alone. re-release it, but don't remake it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young lady who's babysitting is terrorised by an psychotic killer who constantly rings her up asking if she has check on the children. Unknowingly to her the children are dead and killer is in the house, but the police get there just in time. Seven years later, the insane killer escapes from the asylum and heads back to the city, where he becomes infatuated with a lady who he meets in a bar. But an ex-detective who was on the original case is now a private investigator and is hired by the father of the dead children to track him down.This phone is far from dead! I might sound like a broken record, but it's true that this film is all about it's unnervingly taut opening and the bone-rattling conclusion. Which, leaves us with the rather basic, but somewhat disappointing wishy-washy midsection that kinda stops dead in it's tracks and it just can't match the sheer adrenaline and edge that was created to suck you in to begin with. What grabs you real tightly about the creditable opening 20 minutes is the spine tingling, jerky score that builds upon that nerve-wrecking atmosphere of dread with great penetration. There's also great control with the well-mounted photography capturing that eerie and claustrophobic strangle hold. What also really helps this psychologically gripping scene be so effective is the innocently believable performance by Carol Kane as the babysitter caught up in this harrowing ordeal. The beginning is part of an urban legend and a film short, called "The Sitter", but then it gets extended with some redundant build ups by paving way for a prolonged cat and mouse rhythm that isn't boring, but the suspense evaporates and it just lacks the involvement. Although, some authentically towering performances by Charles Dunning as the private investigator and Tony Beckley as the lunatic heightens the sagging middle. While, the dark and seedy New York backdrop brings a gritty tone to proceedings. This is when we get into the pair's psyche and frame of mind. But the awkward sentiment given to Beckley's disturbing character just felt forced and unconvincing. The film gladly leaves on a very good note, by capturing some of that power that made the opening a very commanding one.Director Fred Walton strings out serviceable direction with enough nail biting scenes, gripping visuals and a modest pace. He provides no cheap thrills here. The cinematography is lush and some elasticity about it, and Dana Kayproff's grand score is chocker block with jolts and rapid cues. It's a true trend-setter in the sound department.An sensationally tight and promising beginning loses its way drastically, but it finishes with an more than satisfying ending. Overall, a realistic stylish and mostly well-crafted thriller that has a premise, which probably peeks far too early.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it when you are home alone or babysitting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And you will get the full effect. Now that they are remaking this film, I find it necessary to review the original, circa 1979.In this film you get excellent, established actors. Colleen Dewhurst, for one, who was also in the Stephen King thriller "The Dead Zone". She adds a certain ambiance which today's actors could not. Tony Beckley is the villain, and Carol Kane is also good as one of the victims stalked by Beckley. Charles Durning portrays a detective, there is the usual search for who the madman could be...etc...but it is believable in part because there are no "special effects" or sci-fi type scenes. Just a girl alone in the house, being tormented by calls from a psychopath. Something everyone has imagined, at one time or another."Have you checked the children?" is the popular mantra, as the villain calls Kane. His voice alone is enough to send anyone running. I will not spoil the story, but there are some great scenes with Dewhurst in "Torchy's bar", apparently now a seedy part of San Francisco.That is the beauty of 70's movies, many of us can remember the gritty scenes on TV (movies like "Dog Day Afternoon", "French Connection", "The Conversation", "Duel") There was just something intensely menacing about the way films were made, and the creative directors who didn't have to spend billions on special effects, just to capture the audiences attention. See this movie before you see the remake!.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty late 70's awesome casting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this on VHS was an experience. Much time has passed since I watched a film on VHS, specially one from the 70's. The digital world of fast paced, inflated, action centered filmography has all but erased the idea of what reality, brought to the screen, is. Very suspenseful and the casting of Curt Duncan and the Sgt made the film. Curt Duncan is more than believable and carries the movie: he is incredibly scary. The plot is rich but lags towards the end, although, the ending is superb. In the 1993 TV edition, the ending is equally cool, perhaps better. With its retro street shots, back alley chases and obscure atmosphere, "When a Stranger Calls" is a mix of David Lynch, Alfred Hitchcock and everything in the gray area.Note: the 1993 edition made for TV is excellent. Very realistic and an even tighter plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I really enjoyed it! (even the middle part!!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to watch WHEN A STRANGER CALLS after seeing the segment about it on Bravo's "100 Scariest Movie Moments." I am a Carol Kane fan, and the movie looked pretty good. I couldn't find it to rent or buy at any local video store, so I had to order it at Amazon. It got here yesterday.The beginning of the movie is great! Carol really gives a good performance, and it did scare me. It isn't the scariest movie ever made, but it was enough to scare me. The direction was very good, and it was very suspenseful. The beginning is my favorite part of the movie.Then came the middle, which almost everyone seems to hate. While it wasn't nearly as scary as the opening, it kept my interest, and wasn't boring at all. I have never seen Colleen Dewhurst in anything before that I remember, but she was very good here, and probably my favorite thing about the dreaded "middle" portion of WHEN A STRANGER CALLS. Charles Durning, however, kind of got on my nerves. I really don't know why his character didn't just get the police involved. I am sure police would want to catch an escaped killer. If he had done that, they could have caught the guy at the homeless shelter! Anyway, the middle, in my opinion, wasn't as bad as A LOT of other people said. It is actually pretty good if you go into it with an open mind.Then came the end of the film, and the return of Carol Kane's character Jill. I really liked the ending and was not disappointed at all.Overall, I really liked this movie, and I am sure I will watch it again. I think it does get more hype than it deserves, but it also doesn't deserve all of the negative comments.In closing, I would like to say watch this film! You might not love it, but you will probably like it! I gave WHEN A STRANGER CALLS eight out of ten stars!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NOTE: Have you ever heard of an urban legend called "The Babysitter" or something like that? If so, the beginning of this movie will not surprise you. Don't watch any episodes of Mostly True Stories on TLC.Check the children. Kirk Duncan, the psychopath in this movie is isnane and likes to tear people apart with his bare hands, but when we see him he is seen, he acts weird, but meek. Who could he kill? We get an interesting picture of madness with this guy, but when they touch up on his suffering briefly, you want more about his inner turmoil. We don't get it, so he remains in background semi-cardboard. In performance, the actor (don't know his name) does a fine job. Perfect sadness on his face.The beginning of this movie is classic night scare fodder. The surprise will blow you away (see top) The middle of this movie is a bit half baked. Not much goes on. The ending gets thing going again as he goes after his the babysitter from the beginning for one last chance to get her blood. Then, it ends a bit sudden. Ah, well. It's not the best horror flick, but still a pretty good one. Go ahead if you want you're basic "weird seventies movies."Gore: nope Violence: pretty good Drugs: none Sex: none Nudity: a lanky thin guy gets nude. Ugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most scariest movie i saw... The first 20 minutes and the end are very intense. When a stranger calls is a movie with low action scenes but high-wired suspense (except from the middle of the movie where its medium). A must to see... I will always remember the scene where Sargent Sacker tell to the poor baby-sitter `Jill we traced the call, it coming from inside the house... Jill, just get out of that house...` A Terrifying Classic!! Dont watch this movie before baby-sitting... By the way, have you checked the children??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy without being gross</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best things about this movie was that it scared without nauseating--something that few movies manage to do. Too many filmmakers equate gory with scary. The first twenty minutes are enough to make you a nervous wreck even if you know what's coming. It does slow down a little in the middle section, but it's worth sitting through to get to the end. It is also true that there were a few "implausible" things (like the timeline that it was following.) Overall it was a good film,though.Just a side note. I was only about 12 when this came out and was obviously not allowed to go see it. But a good friend's sister saw it and my friend told me all about it at school one day--only problem was I had to babysit that night. I had one of the most nerveracking nights of my life--esp. when I picked up the phone to call my mom just to hear a friendly voice and there was no dial tone!</fullReview>

It just takes all the oxygen out of the air for me. The rest of the movie is boring, apparently reflecting its origin of being add-on footage to the original 20 minute short film. There's a brief, tepid scare at the end. One of the hardest movies to assign a rating to! Its like many relationships -they start out with twenty minutes of greatness and then disappoint!

		<shortDescription>Not wishing to belabor a point already made, I just wanted to add a couple of wrinkles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film in one sentence: Great beginning, draggy middle, implausible end. But others have already noted that.I was a teenage babysitter in the late 1970s (sounds like the title of a movie, doesn't it? LOL), and this film was based on a rather gruesome urban legend that made the rounds back then(yes, boys and girls, there were urban legends before there was an internet. LOL). Same story, the babysitter starts getting creepy phone calls that turn out to be coming from inside the house.My problem with the middle of this film is that, at least in my case, the sympathetic treatment of Curt Duncan worked. I felt so sorry for him, for the obviously tortured life he led and the loneliness and rejection he was experiencing after his escape from the asylum, that it was difficult for me to remember what a dangerous man he was. His scene in the men's room at the homeless shelter was heartbreaking. Up until the final scene when he was threatening Jill, it was hard to see him as all that dangerous. I have to agree with the person whose earlier comment questioned how a man who killed with his bare hands could be such a wimp in a bar fight.The end of the film seemed implausible to me, not only because how would Curt Duncan have known where to reach Jill and her husband when they were out for the evening (surely the babysitter would have mentioned it had he called and asked her, when she got the panic-stricken call from the restaurant). Also ... if this was only seven years after Jill's traumatic babysitting engagement for Dr. and Mrs. Mandrakis, seems to me like she finished school, got married, and had kids darned fast. And with an awfully successful man, judging by the house they lived in and the fact she was home with the kids. She could have been, at most, twenty-five years old, and that's if she'd been a senior in high school during the opening sequence of the film. Her husband doesn't look that much older than her, so how could he have been making enough money to set them up in that kind of house so young?Just a few little nitpicks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie about 1 hour ago and I must say, the beginning really freaked me out. I love all horror movies and I've seen quite a few, but this movie tricked me in some parts! The good points are the beginning, one part in the middle, and the ending. The rest... well, the rest just isn't all that memorable. It drags on for much of the middle. It could have used a few more scares, thrills, ... anything basically. But still, this movie can be quite creepy/scary and chilling if you just think about these events actually happening to someone... that would be horrible and I think that's where some of the terror comes from. Carol Kane does some very fine acting towards the end of the movie, reminds me of Donald Pleasence's performance at the end of Halloween 4. Very well done. This movie is very well made, but could have used a few kicks. I give it an 8/10 because it's unique, scary, and had some great acting and directing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Scariest ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rate this movie as the most original scary movie of all time. Its right along there with the first Halloween, The Entity, The Exorcist, or even Jaws. Of course these can be argued. This was a great film about a babysitter who gets terrorized by a psychotic individual who harrasses her on the phone the entire time from inside the house she's in. The setup was outstanding. The mansion was dark and eerie.The music score alone stirred alot of tension. You are in the scene with her from when she was a teenager to when she becomes a grown woman. I was much younger at the time this movie came out and it gave me the creeps. I only baby sat once and it was in the daytime. And now that I look back on it, I still can't watch this movie alone and if I do, its in the daytime.The ONLY problem with this film was the middle portion. Like other viewers the "creep" in this part of the movie couldn't be sustained. We are introduced to other characters and follow another plot. And then eventually,we get hit with the powerful ending. This is the type of classic that contains a strong beginning and a plausible ending but a weak middle. The sequel to this movie "When a stranger calls back" unfortunately suffered the same structure and response of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was pretty good. (a few spoilers) The opening 30 minutes were pretty scary and really got me interested, too bad the middle part of the movie stunk other wise it would have been great! It still wasn't awful though, i just didn't think the middle fit very well with the rest of the movie at all. At the begining you have a babysitter that keeps getting calls from a really strange,creepy man. She then finds out he is in the house with her and has killed the children she was baby sitting. Then through out most of the movie we follow around the killer. This seriously doesn't have anything to do with the first and the last part of the movie other then the guy is being chased for killing those two kids and escaping from the hospitol. Then in the end it picks up where it left off in the beginning. It was a pretty good movie but they could have just completly left out most of the middle and it would have been fine. I give it a 4/5.</fullReview>

However, it is impossible to keep that amount of suspense through the whole film and still make the story aspect good. The mid section of the movie is average, I'd say. Then when our maniac shows up at the poor house and starts to have flashbacks, we are taking back to the suspense for the rest of the film.I think I liked this movie because it was one of the few horror films I couldn't predict.

		<fullReview>Much like every other comment posted, the opening of When A Stranger Calls is utterly terrifying. It's been a long time since I've seen a movie that has had that effect on me. I started out watching the film with the lights off. By the end of the opening, I had the lights on and was looking around corners before entering another room to make sure nobody was waiting for me.Unfortunately, all the posted comments are correct. After a spectacular opening, When A Stranger Calls falls flat on it's face. The middle is boring, and except for a scene inside an apartment, not scary at all. The film picks up again for the very end, but doesn't quite reach the intensity of the opening. The first 30 or so minutes are flawless whereas the final act, while suspenseful, has loose ends that didn't tie.I would tell anybody to watch When A Stranger Calls just for the opening itself. If the filmmakers could've even made the middle of the film half as good as the beginning, we'd be looking at a true classic masterpiece.My grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has an opening that is the scariest that I've ever seen. I was introduced to this movie by a friend's mother. She actually saw this film in the theatre a while back. And I was told by her that everyone in the movie theatre screamed at the opening climax (when the babysitter found out where the calls were coming from).The sad part about this movie is that it never gets as scary as the beginning again. The suspense increases towards the end but never gains the momentum that it had in the opening scene. This is very sad because this movie could have been a classic in the thriller/suspense genre.But if you like scary movies, I recommend you to watch this one anyways, because it will scare you out of your wits. Since the suspense is already there in the beginning, you don't have to wait till the end of the movie to be scared. Even if you don't have time to watch the rest of the movie, it is worth just watch the opening scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even to this day, the opening sequence (like SLING BLADE, this movie is a feature length of a short film, THE BABYSITTER, from the same director; the beginning being that of the short film.) is the most heart-curdling scenes to date. Like most films of the 70's genre, this taps a nerve and embeds a scar on your mind that will last a lifetime. Many have noted that when the adulthood sequence comes to play, the movie pretty much dies out, like that of FULL METAL JACKET. But because the movie dies out, it gives you time to collect yourself from the beginning. This IS NOT to be viewed by those that babysit or are parents, especially mothers! You have been warned! This is far from being an exploit or gore movie, it is a genuine suspense flick that will chill you to the bone.</fullReview>

Instead of featuring blood and gore, this movie relies on suspense and shock.What is more impressive is that the killer comes across as a real person, and not some bogeyman.Congratulations must go to the screenwriters. Beckley as the killer is brilliant and is backed up by an excellent cast. Great photography, and direction help keep us on the edge of our seats</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film could have been a masterpiece - but went "thud" in the night.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most of the other reviews, the first thirty minutes of this film are tense and frightful. There is a camera closeup of an inanimate object, I think it's a clock and for some reason that scene adds to the anticipation of just who or what is lurking out there or here! (similar to Hitchcock's use of closeups in Psycho) What made this movie go "thud" was when the murderer was so easily beaten up in a bar. Remember he had butchered two children with his own bare hands - I expected more "evil" what I saw was a weak</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Special. The Remake beats it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie out of interest after I had seen the remake. I bought the original expecting something scary after people had informed me that it was scary. How wrong they were.At the start, the movie had the possibility of gluing me to the TV but that didn't last for long, as the middle part of the film (to me) was completely dull with random characters stuck in. In the end I was slightly bored but I decided to give it a final chance. The ending was good but not enough to make this one of the films that I like.Unlike other films that I have watched, the second time I watched this it didn't make me like it any more.In conclusion the film was nothing special.Hope my review helped you to decide whether or not to watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frightening and intense, expect for the middle-part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first 20 and the last 30 or so minutes of "When a Stranger Calls" are probably one of the sickest, most frightening and intense moments in horror film history. The middle part of the film doesn't really few that you're watching the same film, it seems something completely different and even hilarious at some parts, but it is worth the wait for the ending, since it's one of the best film endings I've ever seen! As I, unfortunately watched the remake first, I already knew what happened in the first 20 minutes of the film (the remake is basically the first 20 minutes extended into 2 hours), but the ending, oh boy, I didn't see that coming! When she answered the phone and the voice said "Have you checked the children?" is just freaky. Anyway, I highly recommend the film, it's worth it, even for the bad middle of the film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even with it's flaws it beats the remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the 2006 remake was a pathetic excuse for a thriller, this film is and always will be one of the most enigmatic and strange thrillers you'll ever see. It's also a rare example of "genre-change" that happens infrequently in films for good reason - it usually doesn't work. This film however, is almost two films in one, linked only by the character played by Charles Durning (name escapes me). The first 20 minutes are a taut thriller, with genuine scares mainly to do with the fact the house itself is DARK, unfamiliar and full of shadows, and there is an inherent believability to Carol Kane's performance as the tormented babysitter, Jill.After a harrowing 20 minutes the film shifts genre, and flashes forward 7 years to our killer having escaped from a mental institution, and is now on the loose, although we don't really know what he's got planned, if anything. For 50 minutes or so this becomes a psychological crime drama, with Charles Durning's pursuit of our killer through some seedy streets. While this whole sequence has definite chills and is interesting, I couldn't help but just feel totally repulsed by Tony Beckley's character...he played the quietly deranged, socially-inept serial killer with frightening authenticity...perhaps too much...I just really didn't want to get inside this guy's head, not for ONE minute, let alone 50.Anyway, the film rounds out nicely in the last 20 minutes or so (once we re-join Jill, now married and with 2 kids) and culminates in a terrifically exciting climax that literally had me on the edge of my seat.Not a great film...but even with it's flaws it's easily a better film than all the crappy remade horror films out at the moment. See the originals if you want genuine scares, good stories and great film-making. Don't see the remakes, put simply, they are CRAP.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Why haven't you checked the children?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't be fooled by sloppy sequels or totally inadequate re-makes! When it comes to sheer terror there is nothing quite like the original version of "When a Stranger Calls". The first 20-30 minutes of this film are perhaps the most terrifying ever filmed! Anyone who has ever been in their house alone can relate to the situation that young Jill finds herself in during the first few minutes of this film. She is stalked unmercifully by a crazed lunatic who is constantly calling the home at which she is babysitting. As the strings of tension are pulled tighter and tighter with each increasingly bizarre and horrifying telephone call, it is soon learned that these calls are coming from inside the house and that the children are dead! The rest of the film centers around the locating and tracking of the perpetrator after he escapes and begins to stalk yet another victim as well as Jill. There are 2 lines from this film that are forever embedded into horror movie history and that is the line "Why haven't you checked the children?" and "The calls are coming from inside the house...get out of the house NOW!". You will never again feel safe in the dark after viewing this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly time-filler with a memorable (and much-parodied) opening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie begins with Carol Kane. She's a babysitter alone in a house with two children upstairs. An unknown man repeatedly calls, asking "Have you checked the children?" Eleven minutes later we get the grisly punchline, now well known and much parodied. The story jumps seven years. The caller was an insane killer (Tony Beckley), who has since been confined to a mental hospital. He escapes. A private detective (Charles Durning) is hired to catch him. Meanwhile the killer tries to pick up a woman in a bar. That woman is played by Colleen Dewhurst, a great actress who arrests our attention the moment she appears. She is menaced by the killer, but the story drops her character in the third act and returns to Kane.The script stinks of cheapness. The dialogue is flat. The characters are pawns of the plot and victims of the authors' estrangement from motivated human behavior. Why doesn't Kane check the children after the first call? Why isn't Dewhurst shocked and frightened when Beckley first appears at her apartment? Doesn't she realize he must have followed her in secret? Why does Durning want to kill the killer? Why does Durning issue the impotent threat of a search warrant to get into Dewhurst's apartment? Why does Dewhurst let him in anyway? For the killer we have a hundred whys. Beckley gives a fine portrayal of a desperate, tormented man; but we have no clues why he commits his crimes. The script's tautology: he does insane things because he's insane.But the director deserves some credit. Even with a small budget and a bad script, Fred Walton gets good performances from a first-rate cast. He skillfully handles each sequence, wringing terror and dread from a bone-dry and boneheaded plot.And the remake? I probably won't bother. Remakes of old suspense thrillers are like children taken off Ritalin. They tear about at top speed with no apparent purpose. Just give me a few thousand bucks and a time machine set to 1979. I only want to make little changes. I want to reveal that grisly surprise right away. You heard me. And I have two reasons: I'll sacrifice surprise for more suspense; and I'll prevent audiences from thinking this is a shaggy dog story that doesn't know when to quit. And I want Colleen Dewhurst to walk out of the bar without that silly exit line: "I don't why I keep coming back to this dump." And let me fix two editing mistakes. One is in that montage where Durning is passing around Beckley's photo. We're shown a man with a bandage covering half his face. Who is he, and why is he wearing a bandage? We'll never know. The other is in the scene where Durning searches for Beckley in the hostel. He shines a flashlight into a man's face; we cut to a close-up of Beckley, whom we assume is that same man. He isn't.Should you bother with this movie? Sure, if nothing else is on. Just keep your cell phone out of reach, or you'll occasionally want to throw it at the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good thriller, and pretty creepy. You might hesitate next time the phone rings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You're a baby sitter, all alone. The children are sleeping upstairs. All of a sudden, you get a phone call. A creepy voice comes through the other end of the phone, and says "Have you checked the children?" After a few phone calls saying "Why haven't you checked the children yet?" or nothing at all, you decide to call the police. They trace the phone call after the creepy guy calls again, and tell him that he is inside the house. You rush out of there, and the police rush in.This is a true story. Well, it isn't actually true, but it is true for the fictional characters that are in this film. There are three main characters: Jill Johnson (the victim), Curt Duncan (the psycho killer) and Sergeant Sacker (I think that's his name.) who is the police man. Seven years later, Curt escapes from the asylum, and Sacker spends his time looking for him. Meanwhile, Jill has become a bitter old woman, who is being bothered by a rather pathetic man in a bar who seems to be taking a likening towards her in the beginning of the film. After a few minutes, a nice twist takes place, and scares and thrills take place all over again.Many claim "When a Stranger Calls" to have a really creepy opening, and then claim that it becomes an average chase movie in the middle. My opinion is that the opening wasn't as creepy as everybody claimed it to be. Yet, the middle wasn't as boring either. Of course, the beginning where we hear "Have you checked the children yet?" is creepier than the middle, but the middle is still pretty decent.The characters are well-put together, even if we hear their name about once during the entire film. One good thing about them is that they are "see-through" and the audience could easily see their actions. For example, take this scene, where the man at the bar is at Jill's house."That was my boyfriend who just called. He says he will be coming over, so you better leave. Now." During this scene, you can tell that she obviously lied to rid herself of the man.I also thought that Curt Duncan made a great villain. No, he isn't on the same level as Hannibal Lecter, but I think he is way better than the villain in "Candyman." Like Norman Bates, (Psycho) the audience gets to know what Curt thinks and feels. Well, there is one scene where the audience is taken into his mind, when he has flashbacks.(SPOILERS) But, one problem I has with the film was the end. I liked the beginning and middle, but the end is where it really fell down. The killer's motives are never revealed, and the film seems inconclusive too.(SMALL SPOILERS) There was another problem. We all know that Jill would look different from her teen self and her adult self. But, after the creepy beginning, and the chase scene middle, Jill seems to change again. This time, she has a husband, two children and different hair. I don't remember her changing from a bitter old woman to a healthy, happy lady! A plot hole, perhaps? Plus, Sacker looks exactly the same! How can that be?! (END OF SPOILERS) "When a Stranger Calls" is a great dramatic thriller, even though it isn't always "edge-of-your-seat." And, yes, Wes Craven did copy the first scene for "Scream." I didn't fins "When a Stranger Calls" as intense as "Scream," but I do prefer this one, due to some flaws I found in "Scream." Good: Dramatic, well-acted, creepy, and has great music.Bad: Never too exciting. Other flaws would contain spoilers.Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first 30 minutes are AWESOME!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an interesting movie. When I first watched it back in high school it made me never want to baby-sit again. Here is the weird part though---the first 30 minutes are AMAZING--I thought the suspense was built up so well, even if you know what's going to happen, it's still great. Then the rest of the movie is OK, but it kind of goes down hill. I read somewhere that this movie is based on a short which consists of the first 30 minutes only and this makes sense as the rest of the movie feels tacked on. I would rent this just to see the first part of the movie (then make up your own mind about the rest of it).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A teenage babysitter (Carol Kane) is stalked by a maniac who keeps calling her to ask "Have you checked the children lately?" Not being able to stand the calls any longer she contacts the police and soon finds out the calls are coming from within the house. Bearly escaping with her life, she grows up to live a normal life untill the same maniac escapes and sits his sights on her again.The opening of this film is terrific. The director really knows how to play up on the fear factor since just about all of us have babysat at one time or another. Sadly though, after the opening the film slows down to a slug pace and drags on and on untill a tense and scary finale brings the film back to life.Rated R; Violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've heard the one about the babysitter who receives menacing phone calls from an upstairs room of the house, haven't you? This rather uneven little movie?an escaped mental patient makes life rather hard for the babysitter (Carol Kane) in different stations of her life?emanates from that very urban legend and gives it a wicked twist. Sadly, this opening 20-minute chapter is the only section worth seeing, as the killer's pathological state is vague and sloppily written and the film's three-part structure could have easily lost the latter two. What I'd really like to see is a 90-minute feature based upon that claustrophobic urban legend. It would take a miracle and a director finely attuned to snippets of eerie psychosexual minutiae, but it could work. Tobe Hooper, perhaps?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even Better Today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1979, in a time where "Halloween" played in theaters a year earlier, and shortly after gave way to the (mostly dreadful) 1980s slasher flicks, this picture is like a jewel of a nightmare film. In the breathtaking prologue (20 minutes), Carol Kane is riveting as a baby sitter beset by alarming telephone calls. We're terrified with her through the entire ordeal, the director Fred Walton using shadows, creepy music, sound effects for unbearable tension. Critics complain about the sagging mid-section of the film, but one must be given reasonable relief from the prior events, until the gripping finale. Charles Durning is fine as an investigator, Colleen Dewhurst earthy and touching as a middle-aged barfly, Rachel Roberts convincing as a psychologist, and lastly, Tony Beckley superb as a mental subject. Sadly, the last 2 actors, both British, died the following year. The opening act was parodied in the first "Scream", another shoddy 1990s franchise. But you'll never forget this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this film, years ago, I found it unbelievable; Now this could happen anywhere. There is more armed robberies, acts of violence, and crazies running around. The film starts out very creepy, with a nut phoning the house asking if you she checked the children, and the first 20 min is a tension build up.(I will not ruin the shock to this scene) Then the middle gets a little bogged down, but the end is a true shocker, when the crazed man goes after the women 7 years after the incident; after he escapes the mental institute. Worth renting for date, it is entertaining and done well considering the budget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modestly made 1979 horror flick that has become a classic today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****SPOILERS**** The movie "When a stranger calls" starts off with young Jill Johnson, Carol Kane, coming over one evening to the Mandrakis residents to baby-sit for their two small children. As soon as the Mandrakis' leave Jill starts getting phone calls from some stranger telling her threateningly "Where are the children?". At first Jill thinking that it's her boyfriend playing a joke on her ignores them but as the calls get more frequent and scary Jill feels that this person is not her boyfriend but a dangerous stranger who is somehow watching her from outside the house and calls the police for help. Jill is told by an officer at the police station to keep the caller on the phone the next time that he calls so that they can trace him. Jill does just that the next time the caller gets on the phone line and keeps him on as long as possible until he himself realizes that that Jill is trying to trap him and quickly hangs up. A moment later Jill gets a call from the police station telling her to immediately leave the house! the person calling her is in there with her and the Mandrakis' children and is calling from an upstairs phone! Terrified Jill bolts for the door, as the caller suddenly appears from the upstairs bedroom, and as the door swings open she runs right into the arms of police officer John Clifford, Charles Durning, as the house is surrounded by the entire local police department. Later the two Mandraiks' children were found dead in their beds and the killer Curt Duncan, Tony Beckley, was apprehended by the police. The first twenty minutes of the movie "When a stranger calls" was one of the most spine-tingling and heart-dropping twenty minutes in any horror or any other type of suspense/mystery movie ever made. The movie never comes close to that level of sheer shock and terror that it reached after that horrific beginning and it was all done by the director, Fred Walton, manipulating his audience with shadows and sounds and with what was happening off-screen and nothing else. After that "When a Stranger Calls" becomes just a good horror movie with the killer, Duncan, escaping from a mental institution some seven years later and the cop Clifford, who was on the murder case at the start of the film, now a private investigator, tracking him down. On the lamb and on the run Duncan at first seems to have a fixation on Tracy, Colleen Dewhurst, when he sees her in a bar and almost gets himself killed by a bar patron when he just doesn't want to stop harassing her. Later finding out where Tracy lives Duncan brazenly invites himself into her apartment only to be thrown out by her when she threatens to call the police. Clifford finding out that Duncan has been bothering Tracy tries to have her trap him only to have Duncan make a run for it, after he tried to beat or even kill Tracy, when she screamed and scared him away. Clifford chases Duncan all over the streets and all through a homeless shelter where Duncan lived until he disappeared in the dark city streets. The movie ends like it started with Jill now Mrs. Jill Lockart, married and with two young children of her own,being revisited by Duncan as he tries to repeat the same crime that he committed at the beginning of the movie. This time Clifford comes to Jill's and her children rescue but was to late to save Jill's husband Steve, Richard Bail,as he puts the killer away by blasting him with a couple of slugs from his handgun. Terrific low-budget horror movie who's opening scene has been copied many times since it's release in 1979. Very good performances by Carol Kane, Charles Durning, Colleen Dewhurst and of course the late Tony Beckley as the killer Curt Duncan. What is so good about "When a Stranger Calls" is that it has almost no gory scenes at all in it but at the same time is far more terrifying that most horror films that have gallons of gore and piles of bodies and body parts in them. Well worth your money and time to rent and watch the VSH tape or DVD of this solid horror classic or to watch it un-cut on cable-TV whenever it's broadcast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my house mates bought this months ago and today I decided to watch it.I had heard it was based on the Urban Legend meant to show parents what they deserve for going out and leaving their kids with irresponsible teenagers.The film started out just great. Jill the babysitter, alone with a couple of small kids, starts to get menacing phone calls. It's the stuff thrillers are made of. But then the crime is resolved in the first 20 minutes, and there is still more than an hour left to go.But then the action jumps ahead 7 years to where the convicted psycho has escaped from the asylum; and the cop who was on the first case is hired to track him down. I found this bit so slow and drawn out that I was repeatedly checking the 'Time Remaining' function on my DVD player and wondering whether my time could be better employed weeding the back garden instead.And then suddenly it got exciting again. We see Jill - remember her? - all grown up and with kids of her own, about to go out to dinner with her husband. OK, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what is coming next, but it was well handled and there was quite a scary surprise bit.But I can't help wondering what would have happened if Jill had checked the kids when the creep phoned in the first place. "Yeah, they're fine, so just shove off."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget the children, check your watch. (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason most folks remember this movie or might have any inclination to watch it may be 1) because the most suspenseful scenes (and perhaps the only moment of suspense) were featured in the horror movie-clip show styled movie, Terror in the Aisles, and 2) because it was recently remade into a nonsense (and needless) teen babysitter horror flick (teenagers alone in a scary house with a relentless killer... didn't see that one coming... again).Perhaps the only interesting device of this film is that it switches points of view of three major characters. First, we have the perspective of the fretful babysitter (Carol Kane) who repeatedly receives phone calls from a stranger urging her to "check the children." Then, we have the Donald Pleasance-like police detective (Charels Durning) who singlehandedly wanders The United States of Britain (really, where was most of the film set?) in search of the kiddie killer who, seven years later, has escaped from the asylum. And third, we have the perspective of seemingly timid-but-actually skillfull-babysitter-tormentor Englishman who is the villain of this tale. Add to this about thirty minutes of pauses in dialog, slow motion attempts at suspense, and almost zero action, despite the supposed gravity of our villain's crimes and his purported penchant for violence.My recommendation: with a movie this boring that hasn't yet been heckled by the MST3K trio, another parody would be fitting such as Student Bodies, who's entire introduction riffs this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young babysitter all alone in a house one evening, receives weird phone calls by someone who repeatedly tells her to "Check the children"!, soon the caller gets extremely violent &amp; the babysitter finds out that he's in the very house she's in! apprehended on the premises, the maniac is revealed to have brutally murdered the two kids she babysat in a rather gross way that is thankfully never shown, locked away in the asylum for the criminally insane, he soon escapes after seven years in captivity &amp; after falling in love with a woman he meets in the bar (who refuses to fall in love with him) &amp; attacking her in her own home, he attempts to pay a visit to the babysitter whom he terrorized &amp; who is now a loving wife with a nice husband &amp; nice children, leading her into another nightmarish adventure. I've been wanting to see this film for a while now, but could never find it any place, finally I stumbled upon a copy &amp; rented it, the tape I watched was pretty wore out, low voicing &amp; the tracking was a tad nasty at times, still that did not stop me from enjoying this well made &amp; well crafted chiller. The acting was fine throughout especially the guy who played the killer, he was really good &amp; made his role really believable (He gave me the creeps!) &amp; there's loads of suspense &amp; fine directing at work here. The first 20 minutes are extremely well written &amp; very tight when it comes to suspense, I was on the edge of my seat! &amp; the climax was also a nail biter! with all that out of the way however, the film after the twenty minute mark really only becomes a detective story about the cop who apprehended the killer following up on certain leads, talking to people &amp; chasing the killer around the city. The babysitter at the beginning finally re-appears in the last twenty minutes of the film &amp; that's really the only disappointment (at least to me there is), I thought the film would have fared even better had she been the main focus in the middle of the film as well, the scenes she was in was good, that's not to say that the middle half is boring, it's entertaining to, I just thought it would have been better if she had been in pretty much the whole movie instead of the first &amp; last twenty minutes of the film only. See this, it's what suspense stories should be! Remade in 2005 &amp; followed by a made for TV movie WHEN A STRANGER CALLS BACK.***1/2 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen a lot of horror movies. This one...is not the worst movie I have ever seen.... but its... just... old. Its dated and doesn't wear its age well. I had heard the hype about this movie... and decided to check it out. I am only writing this review to help people LIKE ME avoid this movie.Don't get me wrong... its not BAD. Its just not... anything special. And its not in the least bit scary. By todays standards... this movie would be rated PG. This is the kind of horror movie that old folkes, 8-13 year olds, and sheltered Christians who are afraid to see anything truly horrifying would enjoy. Sometimes, I enjoy a simple (classic) horror tale (ie The Woman In Black, The Changeling), but this movie literally almost put me to sleep. If they would have just made a 30 minute Tales From The Darkside episode out of the first half hour of the movie... it might have been passable. But. This . is just... BORING.So. If REALLY scary movies are too much for you (The Ring, Ju-On, TCM, The Shining), this is a tame little suspense flick that somehow falls into the horror section of your video store that you might like. If you want to be SCARED... check out something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>lame flick has a somewhat tense opening but it rips off Black Christmas although this could have been a classic it just turns into a detective chasing a killer flick which made me furious anyway in short i guess it worth a watch if there is nothing better to rent at your video store but other then that avoid with your life *1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the few movies I walked out of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really bad movie. A friend and I went to the theater to see it in 1979. It was so weak we walked out and even asked for our money back. We didn't get our money back but we did tell everyone in line waiting for the next showing how bad it was. If you were in that line, then I'm telling you again 25 years later. There was no acting, no suspense and it was not the least bit scary. It does not surprise me that I've never seen nor heard of it since. I just remember it was a really Bad movie! If you're into suspense, this won't cut it for you. It was very hard to come up with ten lines of bad things to say about it as only one line is necessary. Avoid it like the plague.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One major advantage I had was that I watched the rubbishy 2006 remake before the original (something I usually tried to avoid at all costs), so I already knew from beforehand it couldn't possibly get any worse. The remake is standard PG-13 crap without suspense, likable characters or memorable shock-moments and, generally put, just a terribly redundant movie. I always heard and read over the internet that Fred Walton's original is a modest but highly effective little thriller with a unique atmosphere and a handful of genuinely nail-biting moments. That is definitely a true statement. Particularly the infamous opening twenty minutes of "When a Stranger Calls" are petrifying, unsettling, mildly disturbing and unforgettable. So is the climax, in fact. And even the middle section ? which the majority of people tend to describe as tedious and unnecessary, is wholly atmospheric and creepy. Undeniably even this film already was a rip-off, more particularly of "Black Christmas" and "Halloween". According to the trivia section around here, "When a Stranger Calls" initially started as a short movie project but got expanded to a long-feature film simply to cash in on the popularity of the latter mentioned "Halloween". One could of course debate that Walton's film would even have been scarier if it were just those first twenty minutes, but then again, in that case it "only" would have been a short movie and unable to play in the big league. Now, all three films can easily be considered as milestones in the stalk-and-slash sub genre of horror and the main thing they have in common is that they have the simplest and most rudimentary screenplays imaginable. Cherubic and innocent looking Jill Johnson is a babysitter in the house of a prominent doctor one night, when she starts receiving eerie phone calls from a guy whose nasty voice repeatedly insists her to go and check the children. The night ends tragically, with the arrest of crazed killer Kurt Duncan and Jill mentally scarred for life. Seven year later, the psychopathic Duncan escapes but former cop turned private detective John Clifford is on his tail. In spite of some fanatic search work by Clifford, Duncan slowly finds his way back to Jill Johnson. Seeing the first 20 minutes are so great, the pace and intensity level inevitably lowers during the middle section, but "When a Stranger Calls" nevertheless remains a fine thriller. Tony Beckley depicts a truly unforgettable villain. Kurt Duncan is not just a mad raving and sneering maniac, but an unnerving and almost pitiable individual who clearly can't fit into society. Some of the sequences in the middle part, like when he's on the streets begging for money or desperately trying to pick up conversation with a woman in a brown bar, specifically illustrate the difference between this type of villain and the indestructible killer type like, say, Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees. Multiple sequences honestly had me sitting on the edge of my chair and biting my nails, and since I think I can safely say I've seen a fairly huge portion of horror movies over the years, that's an accomplishment I treasure. Ignore the 2006 version entirely and go for Fred Walton's semi-classic.</fullReview>
