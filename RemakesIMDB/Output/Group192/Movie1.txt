		<shortDescription>The perfect family film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Homeward Bound is a great family film, one of the last best used with talking animals. Still to this day I cannot resist watching this film, and I still laugh, keep my eyes glued to the screen and I cannot help but cry. I always have to have a major box of tissues next to me when I watch this movie. It has such a soul and is a great story with wonderful characters. All of us as children had pets who were like our best friends and they were just as loyal back and Homeward Bound shows us the love that animals could have for their owners.Chance, an American Bulldog, explains that he is the pet of Jamie Burnford, but expresses no interest in his owner or having a "home". He shares his home with Shadow, an older Golden Retriever owned by Jamie's brother Peter, and Sassy, a Himalayan cat, owned by their sister Hope. Bob Seaver is marrying Laura Burnford, joining the family. Shortly after the wedding, the family goes on a trip to San Francisco, leaving the pets at a ranch belonging to Kate, a family friend. Kate later goes on a cattle drive, leaving the animals at the ranch to be looked after by one of her ranch hands. However, the animals think they have been abandoned, and Shadow begins to worry about Peter, so he decides to go find them. Sassy and a reluctant Chance follow. They head into the rocky, mountainous wilderness, with Shadow leading by instinct but of course the road is a bumpy one and it's not an easy journey coming back home.I'm going to give a few spoilers here, so don't read on if you haven't seen this movie. There are some absolute great laughs, with Sally Field as Sassy you just couldn't go wrong. Her leading the vet security guard around was so cute and very funny. Plus when Chance is curious about a porcupine, Shadow and Sassy warn him to get away, but being a dog he can't help but wonder and BAM, "it bit me with it's butt!", he's stung with the needles, poor Chance, but what a funny scene! Then there are some very touching moments where Chance is learning how wonderful life could be having a home. The scene where Sassy is reunited with Chance and Shadow was wonderful. Then there are the tear jerker moments that are killer. Shadow falls into a muddy pit where he hurts his leg and can't get out, Chance tries to help him but Shadow thinks he's too old and can't move and says to Chance "I've taught you everything you needed to know, now all you need to learn is how to say good-bye", I'm actually tearing up as I'm writing it, seriously. Then Shadow makes a triumphant return into Peter's arms and seeing him act like a puppy was so wonderful. I adore this movie, the voices, the setting, the story, it's just a touching family movie that is perfect to watch. I have no complaints about this movie and could go on, but trust me when I say it's more than worth the watch.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my most treasured childhood favourites.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HOMEWARD BOUND: THE INCREDIBLE JOURNEY (1993)THE GOOD:--What can I say but I'm a sucker for cute animals, and this movie delivers. I adored the trio of Shadow the old and wise, Chance the loveable goof and Sassy the fussy puss. These animals were too cute for words and terrific actors in their own right, as well as being voiced by the equally terrific Don Ameche, Michael J Fox and Sally Field.--As the animals in the film go cross country, over hills, plains, rivers, forests and more, the cinematography only becomes more breathtaking. I loved the huge scale shots of the giant, beautiful Oregon and California filming locations.--This movie had a lot more dramatic injection than some Disney films coming out nowadays, I really cared for the characters and sympathised with them. I was horrified when Sassy was floating down the river, found it tragic seeing Shadow feel like he couldn't go on and I also felt that the story that took place with the family having lost their pets was realistically dealt with.--Simply put, this film has sentimental value because I loved it so much as a kid, and I think it's bloody remarkable that I still love it as much now. I don't care what anyone says, I'll always treasure "Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" as one of my personal favourites.THE BAD:--Some scenes with the family were horrifically cheesy. I just hate the part where they run around the school getting everyone in the family to collect the animals, and when they're in the car singing "Chitti chitti bang bang". The story with the animals is much more, dare I say it, humane.RATING:8/10 - A beautiful, moving family motion picture that I loved as a child and still do now.IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMEND:Babe (9/10) Cats &amp; Dogs (7/10) Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco (7/10) The Land Before Time (6/10) The Little Mermaid (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most Heart-Warming Funny Lovable Films About Animals EVER!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe I'm a sap but this is the sweetest movies ever! I saw it for the first time when I was around 4 or 5, and I cried my eyes out. Between then and now (embarrassed at age 15) I have seen it over 25 times and have sobbed each and every one of them. Don't worry they're tears of happiness! And it's not all sap! There's a lot of humor and comedy in it too. Usually the whole talking animal thing can be a huge drag but in this movie it's not the case. My only word of advice: Even if you love this-Don't see the sequal...cornyness! I suggest everyone checks this out...you won't be sorry, no matter how old or young you are!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favourite animal movies ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very young when I first watched this movie, and I love it just as much today as I did then. The main idea of "Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" is three pets, Shadow, a wise old golden retriever, Chance, a goofy, fun-loving American bulldog puppy, and Sassy, a hilarious Himalayan cat who are left in the care of their owners' friend that lives hundreds of miles away on a farm. After several days, the pets begin to worry. Thinking that their owners must be in some kind of trouble, they set out on their adventure home.Along the way they encounter many unexpected surprises but their determination and love for their owners helps them in finding their way. For me, this was an unforgettable story of love, courage and devotion that will inspire everyone who watches it. A must see for animal lovers! I give it a 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Nice Family Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Hays and Kim Griest play normal human beings while Sally Field, Michael J. Fox and Ameche are voices of animals. All of them combined to make a nice family movie here, and a pretty successful one at the box office.There are many funny lines given to Fox to read as the main character, the dog. Field also has a good lines as the cat while Ameche plays it straight as the mature Golden Retriever.The only somewhat-bothersome character is the 13-year-old boy who is impatient and pouty at times, but he gets out that after awhile.The scenery is nice, too, with photographers doing a fine job capturing the beauty of California's Sierra mountain range. All in all, a very nice movie and highly-recommended for one of those 'family nights.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie for the whole family!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie for all ages. Its the story about three animals how have to find their way home. There is a bit of a twist at the end and mainly throughout the whole movie. You never know what is going to happen next. This movie makes you cry and makes you laugh. You just don't know what going to happen next. The trek home is all beautiful with all the wonderful wildlife scenes. They producers also spent a lot of money for this movie and it shows too. The animals in this movie were well trained and are great actors/actress themselves. Everything about this movie is great! 10 out of 10 the whole way! Rent or buy it today I can guarantee you will love it the whole family will!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two dogs named Chance (voice by Michael J. Fox) and Shadow (voice by Don Ameche) and a cat named Sassy (voice by Sally Field) are left behind when the family that owns them goes on vacation. They are not sure what happened and therefore they have to find the family. An incredible journey is what is next.This is a movie for all ages but especially kids will love this. The animals, the beautiful nature, some nice and funny moments, a good heart and a happy ending, everything what a movie for the whole family needs. Of course the story is simple and some events are quite impossible, but with movies like this you are not suppose to ask too many questions and you must not be too critical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watch this movie all the time. I've watched it with family ages 3 to 87, and everyone in between; They all loved it. It really shows the true scenes a dog has, and the love and loyalty you get from a pet. Just beautiful.It's great for thoes who love comedy movies, the tear-jerker movies, or even just pets.The music is wonderful, the animals spectacular, the scenes truly thought out, and the characters perfect. What I liked about the characters is the true and nicely mixed personalities: Shadow (The oldest, a Golden Retriever) He's the wise one, filled with the wisdom and mindset of any dog, Chance (the American Bulldog puppy) is basically a puppy with a witty side, the comical character; And Sassy (The Hymilayan cat) She's the real cat who shows what a real cat will do for their owner, the real girly one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a classic! Everybody knows that! I remember seeing the original Homeward Bound (it was called "The Incredible Journey") and it basically was the exact same story this one is, only more bland. I hated that narrator that told us the whole story. With this version, however the story is told by the animals that lived the adventure. That's what makes this story interesting and worthwhile, when you see the characters and the plot from a different point of view.Chance, an American bulldog (Michael J. Fox), Sassy, a Himalayan cat (Sally Field), and Shadow, a golden retriever (Don Ameche) must find their way across the Californian mountains and valleys in search of the family that loves them. No journey is without its conflicts and there are some that each take a toll on the main characters.Another perfect Disney show--it easily scored a 8 out of 10 for me. If you're considering watching the sequel, don't bother. It doesn't have the magic or personality this one does and Shadow sounds nothing like he used to (I think Don Ameche died before they made the second one).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is definitely on the list of my top 10 favorites. The voices for the animals are wonderful. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are both brilliant as the sassy feline and the young inexperienced pooch, but the real standout is Don Ameche as the old, faithful golden retriever. This movie is a great family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by children as well as adults. Humorous and suspenseful, and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry!

		<fullReview>What a fun movie! I enjoyed the locales, scenery, and just had a ball when I saw it several years ago in the theater. Now my family owns the video. Chance, Sassy, and Shadow are adorable animals and are voiced perfectly by Michael J. Fox, Sally Field and the beloved late actor Don Ameche. I also loved the family and felt they were played very realistically. I especially loved Robert Hays as the gentle stepfather who wants to do right by his new stepkids. If you're looking for good, clean, solid and funny family entertainment, you can't go wrong with Homeward Bound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film you can watch when your feeling down. ''A story about courage adventure and friendship.''</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film when i was around 6 or 7 years old and didn't really think it was anything particularly special. AS time went on i watched it a few more times and it started to grow on me as i started to understand the morals of the film, which i will come to later. For a while i left this film alone and didn't watch it for a while. When looking for an old classic film to watch a few weeks ago (now being 15), I dug out the VHS of homeward bound. After watching this i was left on a natural high that i couldn't really explain. The film gives an overwhelming sense of joy that you never really expect. The films nature of three completely different animals collaborating together to find their way home really sends a message home that no matter how different you are you can always find common ground, something that you all need. The way the personalities of the characters is chosen is truly fantastic. In that you have an old knowledgeable wise golden retriever, looking after or guiding 'chance' the fun loving if slightly clumsy young American bulldog, with sassy the clever, vulnerable but confident cat. The film follows these three friends or companions on a journey that is so realistically impossible it creates magic in that you start to believe that this journey can happen. I don't want to sound like a soft tissue grabber when it comes to films i assure you i am quite the opposite, but the most uplifting part of this film is without a doubt shadows return, when shadow desperately tries to escape and chance and sassy, painfully are told by him to leave. When both animals return to their beloved owners there is a silence until shadow limps over the horizon to the awe of all. There is a fine line between heartwarming and corny rubbish but this film is pure magic even at the age of 15. This film may not be Lord of the rings but for Disney to produce such a fantastic film using animals and for it to uplift myself in the way it does even at this age it deserves 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the greatest Disney movies ever made. It's a real pleaser to anyone. It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and it'll put you into suspense.Basically, what Homeward Bound is about is three household pets who are sent to live on a farm while their owners go on vacation. They don't know what is going on, and desperately wanting to go home, they escape from the farm and try to find their way home through the wilderness.This is one of the last movies that Don Ameche starred in. He provided the voice of Shadow, the old, wise and friendly golden retriever. Also starring in this movie was Sally Field providing the voice of Sassy, the Himalayan cat. But seriously, what this movie is all about is Chance! Voiced by Michael J. Fox (my all-time favorite actor), Chance is basically all you'd expect from a dog, lovable, playful, energetic and goofy, and every time I crack up when watching this movie, it's because of Chance; it's like the comedy never ends! This movie is also very sad at times. It sometimes reminds people of the times they've been alone or when they lose their pets.One scene that always puts me in suspense is the scene where the trio is trying to escape from the pound; I especially feel shocked at the part where Chance gets his collar caught in the fence and almost doesn't make it. The movie had other suspenseful moments, but none to me seem more suspenseful than that one.Overall, it's a wonderful family movie. If you enjoyed this movie, you'll probably enjoy the sequel too. I give this movie a solid 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful movie, with excellent acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a kid I thought this movie was great. It had animals, it had beautiful music, and it had my favorite actor: Michael J. Fox. Now, I still love this movie, for different reasons. It has well trained animals that are put through various stunts and scenes that look excellent on camera. It has beautiful, well-written musical that fits the scenes perfectly, with rousing fast-paced melodies and the heart wrenching main theme, that still makes me cry. Even when people hum it. And it has my favorite actor, Michael J. Fox. Based on a book, this is the story of three house pets, an intelligent, overly-trusting and considerably paternal lab by the name of Shadow, a witty and vain - but still smart - cat with a fear of water named Sassy and a street-smart ridiculously curious and slightly neurotic bulldog, Chance. The three are taken to a friend's farm when their family goes away. Dismayed and worried, the pets break out and plan a trip across the Sierra mountains for the trip of their lives. A truly incredible journey. So what, maybe home IS just over that mountain. But what if it isn't? I suggest Homeward Bound for people that like the three amazing actors providing the voices for the lead animal characters, and for anyone else that ... yeah, everyone go watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartwarming Adventure of Hope and Survival</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the wonderful remake of the 1963 Disney feature "The Incredible Journey" and rivals its predecessor in warmth and beauty. Both are based on a true story. A family needs to relocate for a brief period, but cannot take along their 3 pets; a cat and two dogs. Left in good hands on a farm, the animals feel abandoned by their masters, determined to find them. The 3 pets 'escape' only to endure many challenges. Upon hearing what happened, the family begins a desperate search for their beloved pets.Of course, all ends well. This film does more than give a mushy account of a pet/master reunion; there are serious 'situations' dealt with honestly and with feeling. A stepfather at last is accepted by the children of his new wife. The ultimate triumph of this movie is the plea to NEVER LOSE HOPE!*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Home is Just Over That Mountain"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Ever wonder what your pets are thinking? Well that mystery is solved in this delightful Disney movie. It's an update of the original Incredibly Journey, that, when compared to this movie, is not that good. The story opens at the Bernford residence. They've got three kids, Peter, Hope and Jamie. Mom, Laura, has wed Bob Severe (Airplane!'s Robert Hays). The kids are getting adjusted to their new father.The kids each have a pet: Peter, the eldest, has Shadow, an elderly golden retriever, Hope has Sassy, a sassy Himalayan feline, and Jamie has Chance, an adopted Bulldog (for those of you who thought he was a boxer, YOU'RE WRONG!! He's a bulldog, silly! An American bull- dog!) Anyway, Chance was rescued from the pound. He used to live out on the streets. Bob's got to go to San Fransisco on business and he's taking his new family there with him, only the pets can't come. Luckily, Laura had a friend named Kate who owned a farm outside town and she was delighted to take in the animals. They felt abandoned, but Shadow was confident that Peter would return. Then, Kate had to go on a stock drive with her horses, leaving the animals alone. Shadow felt something was up so he jumped the fence and was determined to head for home. Sassy and Chance followed behind. Little did they know that they were many, many miles from home. Along the way, they encounter bears, mooses, and porcupines. They even find a lost little girl and when she is found, the pets are taken to the pound. They were being held there for their owners, but they didn't know that, so they escaped. They were almost home when they fell into more trouble, or rather Shadow did. But they get home and are overjoyed to be reunited with their owners. Very good movie! Have you figured out what famous people voice the pets? Don Ameche (Cocoon, Harry and the Hendersons) voices Shadow and really gave a wise, old, intelligent edge to the character; Sally Field (Smokey and the Bandit, "Flying Nun") is Sassy. She was born to play that part! Really fit right in. And Michael J. Fox (Teen Wolf, Back to the Future) is Chance. This movie was followed by a real sappy sequel: Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Fransisco. The whole original cast returned, with one acception: Poor Don Ameche died three years prior to the film. I'm sure he wouldn't have liked it anyway. Ralph Waite was Shadow in that movie, but it just wasn't the same without Ameche. So anyway, don't see Homeward Bound II. It's incredibly sappy, sucky, detestable and not only that, it isn't any good. But definately see the first one! Absolutely!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine animal movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of the 1963 oldie 'The Incredibly Journey'. Surprisingly the plot is almost identical. The biggest difference is that this version is more movie-like and has far more humor. Another big difference is that the animals talk here, which is good because they only talk by telepathy. If they talked and moved their lips like people or like animals do in cartoons, it would be phony and ridiculous. I hate it when they do that.The older version resembles a documentary, humor is not a priority and the animals don't talk. That's just the way they are: simply animals and not human-like. More than a remake, this more recent version is a more likable and amusing film although clearly based on the old one.For those who are fond of good animal movies, I dare to say that this is an instant classic. It's very hard to find an animal film of good taste like this nowadays.This charming motion picture is heartwarming, touching, fun and contains lots of adventure, enjoyable characters and a classic soundtrack. The Sierra mountains are astonishing, being the result rich and wonderful landscapes, so beautiful that it's like a dream.As for the pets (3 great animal actors voiced by human actors who do a pretty good vocal job), Sassy and Chance are a comic relief. Shadow is wise and caring. Shadow possesses all the qualities a Golden Retriever is supposed to have, which makes him a favorite (and besides, I adore Golden Retrievers). The human characters, more precisely the family, are likable characters too and well performed by the actors.This film was followed by a sequel which is okay but lacks what makes the first one such an appreciated classic.Title in Portugal: 'Regresso a Casa'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the nicest animal movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey' is one of those great old movies about house pets. Deserves a place among the great movies of its genre, together with others like 'Old Yeller', 'Napoleon', 'Fluke' and 'Air Bud'. This means it is more than just a movie about pets.Can this possibly be just a "remake"? It is too good to be a "remake"! I first saw this in 1996 or 1997 on television. I was 12 years old at the time. Of course, back in those days I was far from imagining that there is actually an original motion picture. Although I am all against "remakes", this is a unique case of a "remake" I happen to like better than the original. The basic plot is very similar in both movies, but the original feels more like a documentary than a movie. The "remake" is more movie-like, more humorous and with some significant changes, but without abandoning the values of the original.This is a nice family movie, one to treasure. Certainly one to put a smile on the faces of those who appreciate this kind of films. A classic. It's dramatic, full of adventure, highly entertaining, charming, nostalgic and heartwarming. Cinematography is wonderful (with dazzling landscapes/sceneries of the magnificent Sierra mountains). Speaking of the vistas, it's not all mountains: forests, trees, rivers, waterfalls, sunsets... in conclusion, all of pure nature's wonders - truly a full panorama. And I haven't talked about the soundtrack, which is more than capable of making the most emotional sequences more powerful.For me, the saddest scenes in the film are: when Peter waves goodbye to Shadow and Shadow begs him to wait; when Shadow falls into a deep muddy hole and gets hurt and can't get out (even telling that it's time to learn how to say goodbye); the ending, when the 3 pets return to their human family (which includes a sad scene which Peter thinks that Shadow was too old to make it moments before the dog returns).When it comes to our quadruped pals, Shadow is my favorite. Shadow is the wise, beautiful, caring and loving old Golden Retriever. Chance, the American Bulldog, is the opposite of Shadow. He is carefree, silly, impatient, anxious, clumsy, hilarious and loves to play. Chance just can't stand still. Sassy is the epitome of cats's image: elegant, independent, very confident and self-proud, with a typical cat attitude but a certain feline charm. Sassy is a Seal Point Himalayan cat, one of the most beautiful cat breeds. Our four-legged friends are, themselves, great "actors" by nature. The human actors (including the voice actors) aren't the only ones who shine in their roles.Underrated or not, successful at the theaters or not, this movie is a success for its fans. The sequel doesn't repeat its magic and charm, being far inferior. This should definitely be on Top 250.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most heart-warming tale of courageous friends trying to get home</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been countless talking-animal films in the past, the majority of which either feature animals' mouths digitally animated to nearly match the voice acting, or are ridiculously amateur. 'Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey' is neither.This film doesn't need the infant-pleasing addition of moving canine lips, or gesturing feline limbs. It has the ability to make you believe that the animals are authentically talking to one another, and you can get rather emotionally attached to them at heart (as all great boy-and-and-his-dog films should).Homeward Bound is the epitome of all family-friendly animal romps to me, and boasts some beautiful cinematography, an inspiring soundtrack (from the genius of Bruce Broughton), and an impressive cast...Michael J. Fox ... ChanceSally Field ... SassyDon Ameche ... ShadowFrank Welker (Voice God) ... VariousIt is a modernised version of the children's classic work of fiction 'The Incredible Journey', which was made into a semi-documentary film by Disney long long ago in 1963. The sequel (Lost in San Fransisco) isn't nearly as good a film, but extends the adventure of my favourite furry-footed friends, and is a fun urban-twist on the grand-outdoor-adventure theme. Want to entertain your children with a witty, pretty, heart-warming mini-epic, without the idiotic and often utterly ridiculous comedy of modern children's cinema? Parents, buy all three films for your children - now! Thank you, Disney, for bringing a tear to my eyes with each time I watch this early-90s classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really cool movie! I remember first seeing it when I was really young and I used to watch it all the time like once a week...Shadow was my favorite character in the movie. Homeward Bound is really funny and its really cool how they train the animals to do all those things. Parts of the movie are sad though (such as when Sassy, the cat, falls down the waterfall, and when Shadow falls in the hole at the end.) I have seen the second Homeward Bound but I gotta say its not as good as the first. Shadow is the smart one, Sassy is, well, Sassy, and Chance is the funny idiot. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedies, or talking animals. This is one of my top ten favorite movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible Journey made more incredible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is simply a classic film where the human voices coming from the animals are really what they're thoughts are. I don't know whether my video copy has a scene missing but it never shows how the dogs got out of the pit. It also shows an animals survival instinct and tracking abilities.Put humans in the same position ant the helicopters would be out. For once an original film is improved by a remake as the voice-over for the first has been removed. Only the use of animals can work in a film of this kind because using people would have had to spice out the story by turning it into murder,proving that,after all,animals are more interesting than people</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Childhood Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest child-pet movies ever created. I cry every time I see Shadow yelling "Wait, wait for me Peter!" as the family car is pulling away. This is a must see if you love animals! Best Movie Ever! The lines in the movie are sometimes stupid. Like when Sassy says to Chance; "Cat's Rule and dogs drool!" Lines like this I could do without, but when I was six I bet I loved that line. The storyline may seem hooky to some, but I like it. Shadow as the older dog who's preparing Chance to take over for him when he's gone is really moving when you think about it. It reminded me of my childhood dog. I think everyone can find a piece of themselves in "Homeward Bound."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well done.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great voices, lots of adventure and clever dialogue make this a very good movie. The addition of "character" to the three lead animals gives the story a lot more depth and meaning, particularly the relationship between the older fellow, Shadow, and the young hellraiser, Chance. The earlier versions of this film were unable to give the animals any real personality or motive, which is done perfectly here. Sally Field is lovable in anything, but really shines in this film as the proud feline, Sassy. Great contrast between cat and dog perspectives on life, and just the right amount of spirit and warm fuzzies to make the plot and resolution excellent. There's even an uplifting score and beautiful mountain scenery. Definitely perfect for an evening alone or with the kids. Hats off to Disney.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes are a very dubious thing to do, but this one from Disney, based on its own 1963 original, based on an aspiring true story, is actually quite good. Basically Chance the dog (voiced by Michael J. Fox), Shadow the dog (voiced by Don Ameche) and Sassy the cat (voiced by Sally Field) are left behind by their family, and when they are delayed, the pets begin a perilous journey through forest, across mountain, countryside and rivers, in order to get back to their owners. Danger is bound nearly every step of the way, whether it is from rushing water, giant cats, uneven floors, they pull through and manage to get back to their family for the happy ending. Also starring Airplane's Robert Hays as Bob Seaver, Kim Greist as Laura Burnford-Seaver, Benj Thall as Peter Burnford, Veronica Lauren as Hope Burnford and Kevin Chevalia as Jamie Seaver. Having seen the original myself, I would say it is very, very slightly better, but with the addition of the animals having voices, it gives them more personality, and it certainly makes for fun viewing for all the family. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any time you settle in for a talking animal movie, one never knows how cheesy of a movie they are in for. Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey, the 1993 feature by director Duwayne Dunham was not plagued by some of the common problems in talking animal movies. The two dogs and a cat who make the incredible journey to find the owners they think have abandoned them, are well-written and given interesting enough personalities for the audience to get engaged in their stories and sit at attention with them until the very end. Setting out to find their owners and the only home they've ever known, the animals learn a lot about love and comradery along the way. Life is good for Shadow (Don Ameche), Chance (Michael J. Fox), and Sassy (Sally Field). Both dogs and the cat are cared for and loved incessantly by their wonderful attentive owners. After their owners marry and their family grows, something unusual happens. They notice a lot of suitcases and they go to a strange place. Unbeknownst to them, Bob Seaver (Robert Hays) has gotten a researching job in San Francisco and will be temporarily locating the family there until his project is done. Leaving the animals at a friend of their female owner's, the family leaves with promises misunderstood by the animals of returning for visits. Perplexed at their loving owner's abandonment, Shadow is convinced a mistake has been made and encourages the dogs to follow him in an attempt to find their owners. Traversing the rough and wild terrain proves more than the animals anticipated, and soon wonder if they will be safe and loved ever again. The visuals in Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey were strikingly captivating, much grander and more beautiful than I expected from a children's movie. The establishment shots in the beginning especially, were breathtaking capturing the true wilderness the animals would have to endure. Watching a family movie, one expects a decent amount of clean packaging, which did occur in Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey, it is easily forgiven however because the creatures were so well-written. It was fun to follow along with the main characters despite them not being human. Talking animal films are usually in a class by themselves as far as cheesiness. Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey doesn't suffer from such cheese, however. I believe, a large reason why Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey is so tolerable is because the animals mouths don't move in sync with their dialogue. I always thought that the synced mouth movements and dialogue was a peculiar choice for filmmakers of talking animal movies. The decision makes it no more believable that animals are actually talking simply because their mouths move like human's when they speak. A few brilliant filmmaking decisions, a beautifully shot film, and a perfect ending scene make Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey the perfect film from one's childhood with their own blossoming families.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original version, simply called "The Incredible Journey", is a good movie, but admittedly feels more like a documentary rather than a movie. Besides, it has very little (if any) humor at all. The animals are also 2 dogs and a cat, but their breeds and names are different, plus their roles are different and they don't talk."Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey", is in my opinion a more enjoyable film while retaining a very similar plot. It is a practically complete movie. The whole thing is charming, timeless, fun yet touching at the same time and memorable. It is also visually stunning, thanks to the gorgeous sceneries and backgrounds. The dramatic soundtrack is another major plus. This is truly one of the greatest animal movies ever.The 3 pets are great. Shadow (my favorite), the mature and loving Golden Retriever, is truly an adorable animal (canine loyalty at its best) and superbly voiced by Don Ameche. Chance, the disobedient American Bulldog that loves to play, is hilarious and couldn't be voiced by other than Michael J. Fox. Sassy, the sophisticated Himalayan cat, is as fun as Chance? in her own way and well-voiced by Sally Field.The human characters are enjoyable, even if they don't have that much of a role. Nevertheless, they are well-portrayed by the actors: Robert Hays as Bob Seaver and Kim Greist as Laura Burnford, Benj Thall as Peter Burnford, Veronica Lauren as Hope Burnford, Kevin Chevalia as Jamie Seaver and Mariah Milner as Molly. Of course that the animals were terrific actors as well: Ben as Shadow, Rattler as Chance and Tiki as Sassy.Even though this movie is a remake, it had a sequel which is far from being as good, even if it had its good moments. Besides, even though this movie is a remake, it is one of the few remakes of truly high quality.To finish my review, I think that this should be on Top 250.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was my favorite movie as a kid! Actually is now one of my favorite movies of all time! It's the perfect family film that will have you laughing, on the edge of your seat, clapping, and crying! The amazing story of two dogs and a cat who travel through the Sierra Nevada Mountains trying to return to their owners. This movie has no swearing, no violence, a little bit of profanity, but overall great for all ages! This film takes you on the adventure of a lifetime with great cinematography of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, awesome animal training, and an all star cast of voices and actors! Sally Field voices the cat Sassy who is the very sassy practical part of the family who has a feud with Chance. Chance the American Bulldog is the young puppy who is very energetic and paranoid about the pound from where he was rescued. Don Alder voices Shadow the old Golden Retriever who is the leader of the family. If this movie does not have you balling at the end of it then you have no soul or have never owned a pet in your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Disney family fare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney remakes The Incredible Journey: the location is different (Oregon here, doubling for California), the breeds of the itinerant trio have been tweaked, the family is a bit higher profile, and this time there is no narrator: the animal threesome are voiced by notable talent (Don Ameche, Sally Field, Michael J Fox).Otherwise, the mixture is much as before - a journey full of trials, with spectacular scenery as a backdrop, chuckles here and there, and a handful of tear-jerking moments.The scenery is indeed spectacular, the editing is very skillful, the script is none too special, but is largely saved by the sheer professionalism of the voice talent. This is one for a family Sunday afternoon: adults in the absence of kids will find it sugary enough to induce diabetes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take me home, movie! I felt like I arrived home, so relax when watching this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While, it's loosely based on the Walt Disney 1960's film, 'The Incredible Journey', Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey prove to be a great movie. I do remember, watching this movie, when I was a child, and finding myself, very entertain. This thrilling and thoroughly captivating movie has become an instant favorite with audiences of all ages. It's been years since I first saw this, and even today, I can find myself, tearing up for this. Based off, the best-selling novel, The Incredible Journey by Sheila Burnford, the movie directed by Duwayne Dunham, tells the story about three household pets getting lost in the wilderness, on their way to reunite with their owners. The movie is told by narration by Chance, a young American bulldog (voiced by Michael J. Fox), whom tells the misadventures, he had with a wise old golden retriever, Shadow (Voiced by Don Ameche) and a feisty Himalayan cat, Sassy (voiced by Sally Fields). While, the movie is for children, the movie did had some really get frighten scary action scenes for adults. With great editing, the animals really did look like they were in endanger, from waterfalls, mountain lions, and even porcupine. My heart was racing in every scene. I really care for them, and really hope, they survive the journey. This movie made me care, more than 1987's Benji the Hunted. These three animals are so well trained in this film. The owners did such an amazing job with the animals. I was deeply surprised that the cat that play Sassy AKA Tiki was train so well to not only interact with the dogs, but also do a lot of active things. My cat just sit on her butt, all day. Even the small stuff like the dog that play Shadow, AKA Ben sighing on the porch at the home they were left at, was amazing. There was also a great shot of Shadow look like he's shouting run, when the mountain lion appears. Don't get me started with the emotional scene toward the end. Goes to show Hollywood does not need all the computer work involved in animating animals. Still- there were so badly done takes that they kept in, for some inside laughs. It has to do with the dog that play Chance named Rattler. He always tripped or knocking into things like trees. A good example of this is in the reunion scene with Sassy where he trip over a gopher hole. Rattler still had some really funny reactions. I love the cake eating scene, and him playing with the chickens. I do like the movie is view as the animal's POV. You truly get the sense of how life is like for a dog and a cat. They don't truly understand, vacation or short-term leave. They only know, how it feels to be abandoned. I like how the journey starts by misunderstanding. This being a pre-1996's Babe talking critter flick. The dogs and character don't actually talk with their mouth. It just pasted instead on top of their filmed behaviors, a technique which looks more convincing in some scenes than others. Other times, what is being said, doesn't matched what's happening on screen. Great voice actors. Don Ameche really got the token of wisdom/insight down. Michael J. Fox was both funny and youthful. Still a lot of what he said, like Birdzilla and Arnold Schwarzen-kitty is so out there, that makes you need to suspense your disbelief, even more since they don't understand human speech or some human actions. Last, Sally Field indeed got the lady charms balance. She wasn't too unlikeable. She was snarky, but kind and heroic. The characters are way different than the ones in the book. Shadow is Luath's breed type which is a retriever, but has the personality of Bodger's old age. Chance in the book is English bull terrier named Bodger and has the goofy personality of Luath's age. The other big different is that, Sassy in the book is a male Siamese cat named Tao. Even the family was change, from the Hunters to the Burnfords as homage to the original author. Not only is the characters different from the book, but most of the story. In this movie, the three don't meet up with any Native Americans during their trip. The location was switch from the wilderness of Canada, to Sierra Nevada Mountain Range as well. Beautiful use of locations. The soundtrack by composer Bruce Broughton always remembers me to my man's best friend or a really good Western. The Reunited part is just epic. It even used great establish songs, fine, like the Mission: Impossible theme plays as Sassy infiltrates the pound. That was fun to listen and watch. There was a sequel released in 1996, Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco. In my opinion, it's not worth watching, the sequel. They should had just stick to one film. Overall: This is a movie for all ages but especially kids will love this due to the animals and the clever humor. Animal enthusiasts' adults would love it for the action and depth. It has everything what a movie for the whole family needs. A must watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An adorable film about 2 dogs and a cat trying to find their way home</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Homeward Bound is a 1993 film that is a remake of the 1963 film of the same name and tells the story of 2 dogs named Chance and Shadow alongside a persian cat called Sassy who's owners are happily married and decide to go off on a honeymoon,leaving the three animals to stay where they are. Of course Shadow doesn't want to go anywhere else and so he decides to go off on an adventure to find his owner. Chance and Sassy also agree and they go off in their little cute heartwarming adventure together. The last time I seen this movie was when I was a kid and it was a pleasure to pick it up for a bargain on Sunday in HMV. The story is really nice and I like the part where Sassy goes missing and the two dogs mess around with a leopard and the part near the end where Shadow falls down a wrecked train railing and Chance won't leave without him.You have to be the biggest cynic not to love this movie and its now one of my all time favourite movies. It was as a kid and it is now at the age of 23.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You're never too old</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My sister had a VHS copy years and years ago, but our mom got rid of it feeling we had outgrown it. Maybe in adolescence, she was right. Fast forward to 10+ years later and I decide to check a DVD copy out of the library just for old times' sake for no real reason. Prior to now (I'm a 27-year-old single man), I have discovered lots of movies I was too young to see circa 1993...A Clockwork Orange, Reservoir Dogs, The Terminator, Road Trip...OK, that movie didn't come out 'til 2000 and it's not an absolute classic like the first three, but you get the idea! I popped the movie into my player this evening to see if the movie held up. And wouldn't you know it...it does! In fact, I cried so much at the end, my ears are still moist half an hour after it ended.Truth be told, however, the first few minutes are pretty stupid, but it does show Chance and Sassy's resentment to one another, which is important to the story. The real magic comes when the three animals (especially Chance) realize what home and family really means when their child owners leave them on a farm. That's when they decide to make their escape and from there, it's an adventure that may be dangerous, but in the words of Sassy, "I laugh at danger." The most touching scenes are Sassy finding her way back to Chance and Shadow after she was rescued from being drowned and Shadow finding the lost Molly in the woods. The touching musical score from Bruce Broughton is also a major factor.I'd like to note I work with pets sometimes, so I know how it would feel if one of them (or even all of them) just disappeared. My family's favourite cat died of old age in July 2011. As you can imagine, I was heartbroken, but at that time, I was sharing a house with a middle-aged couple who had two shihtzus, so before I went out to do my errands that day, I made sure to say hello to the two little dogs because although one of my family pets was gone, I had two other ones who could be a beacon of hope for me.No matter how old you are or what your tastes are or if you generally can't stand anything that comes from Disney, you seriously must see this film and you'll feel redeemed that way. And as piece of advice: don't be afraid to let a song or a movie or a TV show turn on the waterworks for you; it means you have a soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful movie for all generations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when my children were young in the early 80's. Now 30 years later I am enjoying it again with my granddaughter. For a two year old she sits spellbound through it from beginning to end. She is always concerned when Shadow falls from the railroad tracks in to the mud and cant get out and encourages him to keep trying. My favorite scene is the suspense building as you wait for the animals to come in to view in the end and return to their owners. Waiting for Shadow to make his appearance always has the tears running down my cheeks. I know he is going to make it but it is still an emotional scene as he gains speed running to his owner. I had to order this movie to add to my granddaughters collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On a social networking site, a friend posted a screen cap of a movie with edited captions on it. The movie was of some dogs talking to each other. I looked it up and discovered this movie.I got it and watched it. My younger sister came in halfway and she is very sensitive to movies that are even a little bit scary. To give an example, she cried at the end of Open Season because she didn't think Boog would make it back home and was upset about it.So with that in mind, I watched the movie for the first time. And so I didn't have the nostalgia feeling as many did. But I still enjoyed it and could tell that it could produce that feeling for those growing up. I really liked the plot, the simplicity of the animals speaking (no moving animated mouths or anything) and the music helped to fit in with the theme.I rate this 8/10 for a brilliant movie that deserves a higher rating on IMDb than a 6.</fullReview>

An old craving to make a vagabond amidst nature popped up again ! Having experienced the psyche of cats and dogs closely, I enjoyed the depiction.Though cats are not as emotional as Sassy,it feels good to see it that way.Chance is a typical pup which appeals directly due to it's raw innocence.Shadow,on the contrary,adds much of the emotional flavor the movie has.All in all,the movie is a win.Only one sad thing struck my mind - I doubt if the future generations will ever experience an idyllic,artless childhood amidst a calm nature !!!</fullReview>

It's a pretty old movie but it will always hold a place in my heart.There aren't any other live animal movies that I can think of at the moment that I even could compare with, let alone like as much as this one. I might be giving too much praise to this movie but I don't think show. I really holds that great message that" Home is where the heart is." Or at least that's the message I gained from it.

The cat is named Sassy and she lives up to her name. Chance is the younger dog who knows a lot about life on the inside of the pound. Shadow is the older and wiser dog who senses things. Put those three together on an adventure and it makes for a happy and fun filled time. There are no special effects of the mouths moving so it isn't cheesy at all.

		<shortDescription>Charming and beautifully filmed movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I loved Bruce Broughton's music score, very lyrical, and this alone added to the film's charm. The best aspect of the movie were the three animals, superlatively voiced by Michael J.Fox, Sally Field and the late Don Ameche. Whereas Fox has the funniest lines, Ameche plays a rather brooding otherwise engaging character(the voice of reason), and Field adds wit into a character that is always seen telling Chance off. The humans weren't as engaging, and sometimes the film dragged, but that is my only complaint. This is one beautiful-looking film, with beautiful close up shots of Canada, I believe. Although the film itself is quite long, there is never a seriously dull moment, and this is advantaged by the voice work and a well-written script. All in all, a charming and perhaps underrated film, with a 9/10 from me. Bethany Cox.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS ALERTHomeward Bound: The Incredible Journey is an important film from my life because it's the first film I remember seeing in the cinema of my home town as a 4-year old scamp. The story is based on the Sheila Burnford novel, and is a reason why it's not possible to write this one off as a brainless Lassie clone.The basic story: Two dogs and a cat happily live in the Seaver family when the new husband to the mother of the three children, gets a job in the city and they have to temporarily move into inner San Francisco while the animals are sent to a ranch to live for a couple of months. The bonds between the animals and the children they watch out for are especially strong, and Shadow the golden retriever and Sassy the Himalayan cat are heartbroken as the children are, though the young and happy-go-lucky American Bulldog known as Chance is a little less concerned and somewhat cynical (due in part to his voice-over explaining his being abandoned as a pup, picked up to an animal shelter, and being bought by the family), though his growth as a character during the story provides much of the important storytelling.The three pets escape the ranch and head off into the wide and dangerous wilderness (fantastic wilderness settings by the way), driven on by Shadow's instincts of direction. They meet several perils along the way, hoping to make it home, while the family and the ranch hosts are suddenly concerned about the animal disappearance. There are funny moments all the way through, great dialogue between the three animals and hilarious lines (see - memorable quotes), and a touching comradeship that grows between the main characters during the course of the storytelling, punctuated by moments of sadness (such as when Sassy's arrogance of trying to cross a river without getting wet causes her to fall in the river and get washed down a waterfall, leaves a moment of loss that is felt deeply by the viewers).Somehow though, I fail to see what the inclusion of saving the girl lost in the wilderness adds to the story and the journey they take. Somehow, it seems a little unnecessary as part of the story.The ending cranks the stakes higher when shadow falls into a pit in a trainyard and having hurt his leg, finds it hard to get out and gives up, exhausted, followed by Chance climbing in with him to persuade him to climb out, telling him how important he is to him and how he's pushed them this far so he shouldn't throw it all away so easily. The way that this scene (brilliantly done) isn't concluded leaves an ambiguity that carries on into the final scene when Chance and Sassy return home, but Shadow is nowhere to be seen. Then just as all seems lost, he slowly appears, and is reunited with the family. Chance's conclusion at the end speaks of the comradeship that has developed between he and his fellows on the journey, and the realisation to what home really is from his long journey to get there, leaves a fine epilogue to demonstrate how much his character has grown, but also how the other two have as well. Hang on a second, I think I'm going to cry...Anyway, I haven't read Sheila Burnford's book, so I don't pretend to know where the differences between book and film lie. But this is a film that all the family can watch, and while the tots will love the talking animals, older viewers will understand the plot line better (as I found when I watched the film again after several years without seeing it). This film is a masterpiece in cinema, and I suggest that if you haven't seen it you go out and get it!And please avoid the sequel (see my review for Homeward Bound II!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable film for all the family- especially animal lovers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original "Incredible Journey" since I was a child, so I can't really compare the two versions. This version tells the story of three animals, two dogs and a cat, whose owners leave them with friends in the countryside when the father of the family has to take a new job in San Francisco. The pets, believing that they have been abandoned, escape and set out on a long homeward journey through wilderness.This story might have been most easily filmed as a cartoon, but both versions are in fact live-action films made using real animals. One major difference is that in the later version the animals speak in human voices, giving each its own distinct personality, something that was not done in the original film. (A similar device of talking animals has been used in other recent children's films such as "Racing Stripes"). Some critics have been rather sniffy about the use of this device, but my own view is that giving the animals distinctive personalities of their own helps to strengthen the film rather than weaken it. The animals were voiced by big-name stars, Don Ameche, Michael J. Fox and Sally Fields.Both dogs are male, and their relationship parallels that between many humans in "buddy-buddy" movies. Shadow, a golden retriever, is the wise, experienced older dog; Chance the younger one is brash, cocky and impulsive. To British eyes Chance looks like a boxer, but is actually an American Bulldog, which is apparently a different breed to its British cousin. Sassy the cat is female with a rather prim and proper personality. She is very proud of her status as a cat, which in her eyes makes her vastly superior to any mere dog. ("Cats rule, dogs drool!").From an adult viewpoint the film has a number of faults; it can be sentimental, some of the incidents (such as the one in which the animals manage to catapult a mountain lion into the river) are quite incredible, and the human characters are all completely forgettable. This, however, is a film which is mainly aimed at children, and I suspect they will enjoy it immensely. Certainly, any animal-loving child will do so. (Comments by some professional critics such as James Berardinelli, who complained that the animals' voices lessened the film's "grandeur", only serve to strengthen my view that professional critics are not always the best guides to children's movies. I doubt if many playground conversations about "Homeward Bound" concentrated on its supposed grandeur).One thing adults will appreciate is the photography of California's Sierra Nevada mountains. They may also appreciate the film's blend of humour and excitement as the runaway pets encounter perils such as bears, mountain lions and porcupines in the wilderness. This is a very enjoyable family film. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Being a child in the 90's this is one of my most memorable films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film so many times through my child hood that even to this day i can pretty much re-sight all of the dialogue. And when I watch it now it just makes me happy and surprisingly still laugh. I think it's amazing how they managed to train animals especially the cat to the extent that they are able to play the main role of a feature film. However watching it now I can also unfortunately notice that it isn't the masterpiece i once thought it was. But i prefer to remember how i felt about it when i was younger watching it on VHS on my fist TV that would cloud the image in yellow. And and bearing in mind it is a children's film, that is why i would still definitely give it 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly beautiful classic, and a favourite for eternity...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a true masterpiece, it really is. It's rare you come across such a heartwarming flick, full of fun, laughter, heartbreak, and with a little drama to keep you on your toes. A true family film, Homeward Bound tells the story of three brave pets, who set out to cross the Rocky Mountains in an attempt to find their owners, following the changes they go through and the obstacles they encounter along the way. One of the truly stunning things about this movie is its ability to give animals human personalities - the voice acting is that good. Shadow is a wonderful character, old, wise and brave, and watching him trying to save Sassy in the river was a very powerfully moving moment. Chance - who wouldn't love a dog like Chance? He's got to be the most mischievous and lovable pup ever shown on the big screen. And Sassy is very witty for a cat - she had me in stitches when she was mocking the keeper; 'Here kitty kitty kitty... not on your life, chubby.' There were also lots of well made emotional scenes, such as Sassy going over the waterfall (I was truly scared for her), Shadow falling in the ditch (almost in tears) and then the fantastic ending, when all three pets return home... including good old Shadow! A favourite for all time - anyone who doesn't like this film must just not like animals. Rent it or buy it now, and it'll leave you with happy memories that'll last a lifetime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of animal movies. If you can take a plot and put animals as the main actors you will usually win me over. Homeward Bound did just this. They took a plot that has been as old as time and put a new spin to it. It was a complete success. It is very much an archetypal movie. You have the obi-wan of the group(shadow) who is wise and logical, you have the lovable but impetuous and untrusting Chance, and the prissy princess who thinks that she should be pampered and praised. These three personalities bounce off of each other very well. I also like how they made Chance and Sassy such dynamic characters, and they did not overdue it. Most people say that it cannot be good because it is too much of a kids film. What they are forgetting, however, is that it is supposed to be a kids film, and this still does not take away from the acual movie. This is a good movie to watch when you are bored and you just want to watch a movie. It is a Disney movie without the cartoons, an air bud movie with a better plot. I would, without a doubt, advise you to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever, or do you have, a pet who's been with you through thick and thin, who you'd be lost without, and who you love no matter what? Betcha never thought they feel the same way about you!Wonderful, wonderful family film. If you have a soft spot for animals, this is guaranteed to make you cry no matter your age. I used to watch this movie all the time when I was a little kid, and I find that now, at age sixteen, I love it as much as I did then. I could never decide on a favorite character then, and I still don't think I can! I love all three of the animals. The dialogue seems very real and comfortable, like a loving, but feuding family. I do love Chance, and how at the end he says that he has a family at last. Cheesy, yes, but one must remember that this is meant to be a family film, and it fulfills that role perfectly. Sassy has just the perfect dose of "sassiness" and Shadow is the perfect leader/role model to the young, adventurous Chance.The animals way outshine the humans, but of course most of the teary moments are to be had during an interaction with them (ie. rescuing Molly, and the end). Not to mention the incredible soundtrack that gives each moment even more emotion, and an accompanying heart-swelling feeling. I give this 9/10. To be compared to (and even rated better than) Cats and Dogs and Babe.</fullReview>

The owners of these beloved pets leave them with a friend(Jean Smart) as the father(Robert Hays)takes a temporary assignment. The three pets believe they have been left behind for good; so they face mountains, waterfalls, a bobcat, bears and a porcupine on their trek back home.

		<fullReview>Genre: Animals, adventure, journey. Actors: The ones for the main characters are Michael J. Fox (Chance), Sally Field (Sassy) and Don Ameche (Shadow). Main characters: Two dogs called Chance, Shadow and a cat called Sassy. I like these characters, they are entertaining, touching and fun. My favourite is Shadow because he is the most noble. Of course I love the whole trio! :-)What happens: Two dogs and a cat's owners are going on a trip to another part of America and the group of animals are left with friends at a farm. Unfortunately, they are not too happy there, especially Chance ? who thinks it's the pound!!Message: It is good to be loyal.My thoughts: I love this film an incredible amount, because it is so emotionally beautiful and special. What is even more amazing is that this is a remake and it is so touching and lovely for a remake of anything! I haven't watched the original film, so if that is more beautiful then blow me down!Recommended to: People who like films about animals, journeying films and talented + funny actors such as Michael J. Fox. Enjoy! :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the greatest family films to watch with your family. It has good humor, a good plot, and some heartwarming scenes. The dogs and cats in this movie are remarkable. I had no idea that a cat could be trained to do some of the things that Sassy did in this movie. It is amazing.Three pets are left for an owner of a farm to take care of when the family is away. After a couple of days and the owners do not come back because it would take more time to get back to the farm than they thought the animals go on a journey to find home again. They encounter perils. Bears, waterfalls, and mountain lions. They are found by people. They are sent by to the pound. Their family finds that out. When they go to pick them out the animals break out to get home. The family goes back home. In the end the animals get back to their house.This is one of the best live-action Disney films out there.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Heartwarming Family Film(SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSYes, this is not a Holiday film. Anyway, I have always loved Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey since I was a young child. I have always been a huge animal lover since I was young. I have always loved films like this. Films like Beethoven, Cats and Dogs, and more. I don't know why, I mean, I'm a guy. Anyway, I have always loved this film for it's comedic scenes, sad, heartwarming scenes, and the way the animals survive.When two dogs and a cat go to a farm when their family goes away for a couple of days the eldest dog named Shadow thinks something is wrong with them and they are in trouble. Shadow wants to look for them. The other two do not. They follow him anyway. Throughout the film they fight for survival. The cat named Sassy is swept away by a waterfall, Chance and Shadow encounter a mountain lion, and much more. Eventually they find Sassy after she is nursed back to health by a birdwatcher. Then their family go back to the farm and find out that the animals are not their. They put of fliers and posters. Then the animals find a missing girl. People come and they are taken to the pound. The family is alerted. Unfortunaley when they get to the pound the animals had escaped. On their way home Shadow falls in a ditch. They go without him. Chance and Sassy get back home. The family is happy, but where is Shadow? The oldest boy Peter, who is Shadow's owner, says that he was too old to make it. Then Shadow comes and it turns out to have a really happy ending.Overall, this is a fantastic heartwarming animal film that any animal lover is bound to enjoy. There are really sad moments in it. For example, when Shadow falls into the ditch, he tries his best to climb up but keeps on slipping back down into the muddy ditch. There also is very heartwarming scenes. For example, when the animals find the lost girl, they comfort her. Shadow then runs across a bridge to alert the adults searching for the girl. I always loved that scene. Anyway, this is a great film, a little too sappy sometimes, but heartwarming and great overall.7/10Recommended Films: The Incredible Journey(Original)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A must see over and over for all ages. This is a seldom seen wholesome, entertaining and funny movie. It is worth watching several times to catch some humorous comments (by the animals) that were missed the first time. The human acting is good, and the acting by the animals is superb! There is an underlying subliminal message that is good for everyone. This movie is especially heartwarming to animal lovers but good entertainment for those that aren't. Also, this is a good opportunity to catch some beautiful scenery. Thanks to Disney Pictures and Buena Vista Productions for producing good movies that anyone can watch, yet still be entertained without resorting to reality TV!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you love pets, and adventures, AND old school Disney, then YOU'LL LOVE this 1993 live action feature called "Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey," which is considered to be a sequel to the early 60s film "Homeward Bound" (Is this movie still around? I haven't heard much about it!!!!!)In it, we have a family from near Fresno, I think, and each of the children have three pets: Chance, Shadow, and Sassy (the last one's a cat). And yes, I TOTALLY recognize the voice of Michael J. Fox, if you catch my drift!!!!! LOL As the family leaves for San Fran, the pets are all alone. Now, they must travel through California woodlands to get back to the family. Will they get back in time?????I've seen this in the drive-in, on TV (Old and New Disney Channel), and on video and DVD. One note: all DVDs around the world are fullscreen only!!!!! Just so you know."HB: TIJ" is a great movie to watch, if you like animals in action!!!!!10 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We've all heard stories about loyal pets who traverse hundreds of mile across unknown territory to be reunited with their beloved owners. 'Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey' is a heart-warming film based upon these poignant stories and is an example that Disney can produce films that are warm without condescending too much into being cavity-inducing.In this film, we follow Shadow, the old wise Golden Retriever; Sassy, the snotty and ladylike cat, and Chance, the rambunctious bulldog pup, who are temporarily left on a small farm while their three child owners relocate to a new city with their parents. When they are not claimed within a couple of days, the pets fear a terrible fate has befallen the children so they escape and travel across America to return to the side of young owners.On the backdrop of some beautiful scenery of America, we witness how the animals can express incredible bonds of loyalty to each other and their human owners and their determination that drives them on. You really empathised with these characters even if they did have four legs and a tail! And the ending would melt even a heart of stone with owners of older pets being left with a warm glow.I have to admit that I love this film as much now as I did when I first saw it aged twelve. It reminds me so much of my own pets: my first dog Toby being the wise Shadow, my snobby cat Fifi definitely fitting of Sassy and the two youngest dogs Kasey and Jake the wee pup vying to be youthfully, energetic Chance. Toby, Fifi and Kasey have since gone over the Rainbow Bridge but this film never fails to strike a chord in reminiscing over them.'Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey' is one of the few Disney films that will appeal to the smallest of kids to grannies in their eighties. Highly recommended to animal lovers out there and folk who love to hear stories of amazing animal bravery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very nice scenery and an exciting adventure, but the characters and humour generally aren't so impressive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing most of this family adventure movie as a kid. It was released early in 1993, and I think I saw it on video later that year. Towards the end, I came across a scene which I found too overwhelmingly sad, and I guess I didn't watch what little was left of the film, though I did watch the sequel, "Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco", from beginning to end shortly after it was released on video in 1996. I believe it's been nearly seventeen years since I watched any of "Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey", but after all these years, I still remember it. After renting it this month, I can say I've finally seen it all. While it's not what I would call a bad movie, I was definitely not as impressed as many others clearly have been.Chance is a na?ve young Bulldog who was once stuck at the pound, a place he hated, but is now owned by a boy named Jamie Seaver. He lives with two other domestic animals: Shadow, a wise old Golden Retriever owned by Jamie's stepbrother, Peter Burnford; and Sassy, an arrogant Himalayan cat owned by Peter's sister, Hope. After Laura Burnford and Bob Seaver get married, meaning that the two families are now one, they go on a trip to San Francisco and the pets are left at a friend's ranch. Chance, Shadow, and Sassy do not understand what has just happened, and don't realize that their owners will come back, so they think they've been abandoned! Shadow decides to leave the ranch and set out to find the family, and Sassy and Chance soon follow! The three of them find themselves on a journey through the wilderness, facing the dangers of this terrain! Chance's lack of experience definitely won't help him on this adventure.The silly things Chance does and the rivalry between Chance and Sassy are meant to be comical, which they sometimes are, but not usually. Chance's antics can also get tiring after a short while. I didn't care much for these two characters, and don't think Michael J. Fox and Sally Field did a very good job providing their respective voices. Don Ameche as Shadow might be the only decent voice-over of the three, and this character is the most likable of the leads. After I started watching "Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" this month, I soon realized how boring I found the film, and that didn't change until I got to the part where the journey begins. There's lots of beautiful scenery through the mountainous wilderness and the adventure of the three domestic animals is often exciting. Shadow's wisdom can be another intriguing aspect of the film, and some scenes are fairly touching, such as the Golden Retriever saving a little girl lost in the forest. However, there's still more weak humour during the adventure, and the scenes with the humans looking for the animals are certainly not as interesting as the ones showing the pets on their journey. None of the human characters really stand out.With a spoiler warning, I will tell you which part made me really sad all those years ago, and the ending that follows. If you haven't seen the film, you might not want to read on, but if you have, then maybe you've already guessed. It's the part where the three pets are almost home, but Shadow falls into a pit and injures his leg, and it appears he can't get out! When I watched "Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco", I knew the aging dog obviously got out of the pit somehow, since he's in that sequel. After over a decade and a half, I finally found out that "Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" doesn't show how Shadow gets out, but at the end, we see the three animals returning to their owners, even though it takes the Golden Retriever longer to show up than it does for the other two. Anyway, overall, this particular animal movie is hit-and-miss, with an exciting adventure and cute animal stars, but also with several significant shortcomings.</fullReview>

Both are based on a true story.A family needs to relocate for a brief period, but cannot take along their 3 pets; a cat and two dogs. Left in good hands on a farm, the animals feel abandoned by their masters, determined to find them. The 3 pets 'escape' only to endure many challenges. Upon hearing what happened, the family begins a desperate search for their beloved pets.Of course, all ends well. This film does more than give a mushy account of a pet/master reunion; there are serious 'situations' dealt with honestly and with feeling. A stepfather at last is accepted by the children of his new wife. The ultimate triumph of this movie is the plea to NEVER LOSE HOPE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Homeward Bound is a remake of a 1963 movie named The Incredible Journey which is in turn an adaptation of the book of the same name by Sheila Bunford.Homeward Bound's story is as follows: Two dogs and one cat who belong to a family are put in custody of this cowgirl woman while the family leaves for two weeks. The dogs become nervous when the woman leaves them, and the oldest dog (voiced by Don Ameche) decides to leave, taking with him the two others. On the way they'll have adventures in the wilderness, a requisite slapstick chase, some "sad" moments and one big happy Disney ending.The characters are well voiced by Ameche, Michael J. Fox (as the young dog) and Sally Field as the cat, Sassy. Each of them brings something to the mix that makes their character unique. What gets to me though is how the animals (real ones) don't move their mouth in sync. Although it does usually look cheesy, the fact that they don't move makes the characters feel sort of detached. To get across some emotion, however, the dogs actually have some really well made expressions. However, the real life actors do not fare as well. It's probably because of the lack of material they have and not because of a lack of talent. (There is, however, the mandatory cute little kid who's actually not too bad and conveys real emotions, sometimes.)What was marking about this version, compared to the 1963 one, was that the animals talk. Yes, they do. Yes, sometimes they are funny. However, the script has about 6 butt jokes too many. Another gripe I have was the fact that the movie strayed way too far from the book. The book had some violent scenes in it, but to get its G rating, they had to be cut or substituted. (The scenes would have only given it a PG rating.) The locations where the movie was filmed are superb and the direction of the animals almost flawless. A good Disney effort. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Homeward Bound: TIJ is packed with adventure, comedy, suspense, drama, and a tear-jerking ending.Unlike many Disney flicks, this has survived the "old movie remade" routine, which, for Disney, is usually an absolute flop.*** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this movie is totally different than the novel and the original film, I must say, most of the movies I've seen based on novels and movies of the past are totally horrible.This movie breaks that standard.It keeps the basic plot: three animals lost in the wilderness who eventually find their way home, only it modernizes our story.Even for the older audiences, this movie has its occasional jokes and one liners, as well as a tear-jerking ending.A must-see for any animal lover!*** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dogs can't talk. Can they?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dogs can't talk. Can they? Well they do in this thrilling adventure about 2 dogs and a cat trying to get home to their family. I guess you could say the pets are "homeward bound." They are obstructed by all these obstacles along the way, but I can't tell you the end. This movie brought tears to my eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>another hit from Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heartwarming, feel-good movie from Disney is one that can be enjoyed by kids and adults alike. The story is about three household pets?two dogs and one cat?who set out on an impossible trek across the wilderness to try and make it home to their owners. As an added bonus, the animals have vocalists that allow viewers to actually hear what it is they're saying. Much more enjoyable than it sounds on paper this charming, emotional, family-oriented story is a compelling tale of friendship, hope, and love, topped off by breathtaking scenery, and brilliant vocal talents that make the film both moving and funny. Rock solid entertainment for all audiences. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Home, with my thoughts escaping home, with my music playing home, where my love lies waiting silently for MMMEEE..." Um sorry, just having a 'moment' there. Don't worry Mr Doctor, I'm still taking the meds.Lets talk about the movie, shall we? We all love pets, right? Well, apart from goldfish. No one likes them. They're B-O-R-I-N-G. Or perhaps I feel that way because of flashbacks from my many uncomfortable hours spent in a dentist's waiting room. *Feels Dentures*. SWEETS ARE JUST TOO GOOOOD. Oops, going off track again. Time for a double dose...I'm back. Much calmer now. Yes, this is all about two dogs who get the wrong end of the stick (ho ho), along with a cat when they are temporarily left at a ranch while their family relocates. Thinking they've been abandoned, they run off to begin a perilous trek through the wilderness to find their owners. Encounters with bears, waterfalls and mountain lions are guaranteed, along with plenty of infighting from these very different species.Yes, of course... what with this being Hollywood, one of the canines is an old, loyal, sensible stick-in-the mud (Coincidentally, this happens to him at one point) and the other is a young, irresponsible, hyperactive ball of fun. I shouldn't need to tell you about the feline. In Movieland, they have but one default setting: Sarcastic, self-obsessed, sneaky narcissists. Hey, I love it. Reminds me of someone...Together, they brave the elements, overcoming whatever obstacles cross their path... and of course, discovering that co-operation and friendship is key to their survival. It's Disney, whadya expect?! We hear LOTS of jokes about the various stereotypical views the creatures have towards each other, including one too many butt sniffing gags for my liking. It's all in good fun though, and certainly more palatable than coming from the mouth of say, Adam Sandler.The animal training is top notch... how they managed to line-up the four legged cast to do so many scenes together with absolute unity is a marvel all on it's own. It's not quite Babe, but mostly seamless nonetheless. Their many adventures will err towards kids, but don't think we as adults would be immune to it's charm. If you don't get a warm glow at the very last scene... then I don't wanna know you. Although some would say that isn't such a bad thing... 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lively but inferior remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a way, watching 'Homeward Bound: the Incredible Journey' was like a milestone in my own personal viewing experience - it was the first time, that I can remember, I found myself settling down to see a remake of a movie I was already well-familiar with. I was still in primary school when this film hit the screens, but already I knew every scene and character of the charming 1963 classic 'the Incredible Journey' pretty much off by heart. It was a simple but engaging storyline which followed a trio of household pets - an elderly dog named Bodger, a young dog named Lua, and a cat named Tao - as they embarked on a remarkable 200 mile trek across the North American wilderness to be reunited with their owners, learning how to fend for themselves, encountering hostile local wildlife, and maintaining a good close-knit bond with each other all the way.This 90s update follows much the same route, with latter day critters finding themselves in a similar situation and enduring all the obstacles that their forerunners did before them (bears, rivers, porcupines, wild cats), with the odd tweak here and there. The main difference being that they themselves have been given significant makeovers in mind-set, moniker and vocal chords - this time round, Shadow, Chance and Sassy, as they're now known, all sport human voices and, unsurprisingly, more human dispositions. This being a pre-Babe talking critter flick though their mouths don't actually move along with the dialogue being uttered, having it pasted instead on top of their filmed behaviours, a technique which looks more convincing in some scenes than others. And, as good as much of the voice work itself indisputably is (Michael J Fox's charisma never wanes), I'm afraid I have to disagree with most of the comments before me that it actually enhanced their story or characters in any way. Sure, Lua, Tao and Bodger of the original didn't speak, but then again they didn't need to. The animals playing them were expressive and entrancing enough on their own, and had a true naturalistic charm in the sense that they were so believable as a threesome of innocent beings wandering through an environment considerably more vast and intimidating than the one they're used to. They may have lacked the ability to express it in words, but it was evident just how devoted they were to both their owners and each other. Sassy, Chance and Shadow, meanwhile, are more outspoken, but this same unifying sense of friendship and affection is something which they certainly don't pull off. Perhaps because the duration of their journey is marked by so much taunting and bickering amongst themselves, which in turn makes them a tad less appealing as characters - the spitefulness always present in the way that Chance and Sassy interact with each other is especially distracting.The fundamental flaw of 'Homeward Bound' isn't really in the talking itself (which always had the potential to be very charming), but that it rarely uses it as anything more than an opportunity to crank up the comedy?which comes mostly from anal fixations and a harmless but wearisome debate about which of the two species is superior (or rather, which one 'rules' while the other 'drools'), along with lashings of silly lightweight slapstick on the side - basically, things which didn't really bother me the first two or three times I saw it, but which started to grate big time as I got older (as opposed to the infinitely more mature original, which has never outworn its welcome). The fact that one of the dogs has a full understanding of who Arnold Schwarzenegger is probably doesn't help their case.Missing also from this mix is not only the bulk of the original's warmth, but much of the darkness and poignancy too - if anything, the story has been distinctly softened up for this particular telling. While its predecessor was never afraid to get ugly in its depiction of the perils of the natural world that our heroes were fording, 'Homeward Bound' chooses instead to play them up for whatever amusement value they might have - the river-crossing mishap, very fortunately, remains a serious matter, but their confrontations with other animals are sorely lacking in the same bite as before (the way in which Chance and Shadow here deal with a cougar on their trail is embarrassingly cartoony and childish).In the end, what we have here is a lively but pretty routine family film for its decade, and which, as a remake, falls way short of the charm, the adventure and indeed the flavour of its forebear. It will no doubt amuse its intended audience, and I suppose that's half the battle already won. More demanding viewers though will be better off with the genuine article, which trumps it on all counts.Grade: C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worth the money...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been much of a fan of films about talking animals, but I'd read the book 'The Incredible Journey' in school and bought this on DVD.Big mistake; while I likely would've adored it when I was three or four years old, I found it to just be your basic generic Disney crud. Chance, Sassy and Shadow are three pets owned by a family with the newly married mother. When the pets get lost in the woods, they go through hell trying to get home, in a very melodramatic tale.The soundtrack was okay, but certainly not memorable.The acting wasn't very good and the voices of the animals were weird and seemed really out of place. In the book the animals went missing in Canada but it's California in this movie.I'm not a kid anymore so I can't speak from the point of view of a child, but perhaps I'd have enjoyed it more had I been a younger kid. My personal opinion though is that it's not worth buying or watching unless you're getting it for your kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did You Hear the One About the Two Dogs and a Cat?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Live-action family film about two dogs (voiced by Don Ameche and Michael J. Fox) and a cat (voiced by Sally Field) that do not understand that their owners are coming back when their vacation is over so they decide to try and find their human family themselves. Stupid pet tricks aplenty here as would-be witty dialogue bores very quickly as a dated routine wears out immediately. The human actors are not around much and we are left with three domesticated animals in the woods. Messages about animal rights and the importance of pets are displayed throughout, but all that noise was little more than static to me. Somehow a big enough success financially to warrant a second installment in 1996. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Difficult to watch, slow-moving film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" is the remake of the older Disney film. The film features three pets who band together in order to find their owners. The animals consist of a pretty wimpish cat, a young dog, and an older dog. They each have different personalities, but they learn to work together and learn to overcome their differences because they need everyone on their journey and to brave the harsh nature.I watched this film when I was younger, before my teens. I found the film to be slow-moving and dull, although I did enjoy the original film. I found Michael J Fox's character to be a little annoying too. However, I think that you may enjoy this film if you like being outdoors and like pets. Expect it to be a little slow-moving, however. Children may like Fox's character and wisecracks, and animal enthusiasts may enjoy it, but I found it too slow-moving and annoying in places to call it a decent film.</fullReview>
