		<shortDescription>Tobe Hooper's return to greatness...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "Toolbox Murders" was a pretty shameful combination of "Halloween" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," lacking the atmosphere, suspense, and gritty charm of those films. At the time of its release (1978), the concept of gory death by hardware (regardless of how peripheral it was to the 'plot') allowed for at least one lasting shock (a nail-gun murder preceded by a very memorable bathtub scene), but otherwise, the film is dated and dull by modern standards.As is clear from the first frame onward, Tobe Hooper's stylish update of "Toolbox" is determined to take the material in a supernatural direction, and for the most part, is successful. Whereas many horror films of late have been drowned in unconvincing CGI gore and calculated orchestral booms designed to elicit cheap scares from the audience, Hooper's film retains the subtle implication of TCM (the villain remains masked/obscured throughout the film) crossed with a jigsaw-puzzle plot that becomes more engrossing as the movie progresses. As far as ambition is concerned, it definitely surpasses the original film's shopworn, "Psycho"-familiar story, and Hooper's assured direction helps greatly.Angela Bettis leads a cast of lesser-knowns who give fine performances (the more grating, clichéd characters are dispatched promptly) and make the premise believable. Similarly, the photography creates fine atmosphere when needed, with the picture often looking like a cross between the colorful sets of "May" combined with the slight grittiness of Zack Snyder's "Dawn of the Dead" remake."Toolbox Murders" is a quirky, suspenseful, and sufficiently gory horror film. In the third act, Hooper re-affirms the genius of his seminal masterpiece by building the tension to an almost unbearable degree, whilst capping the film with a deliciously ambiguous ending.Definitely recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great re-imaging of a slasher classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout the seventies and early eighties, Tobe Hooper was widely considered as one of the greatest horror directors ever to grace the silver screen. If it wasn't for his 1974 video nasty The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, then we may never have seen movies like Slumber Party Massacre or any of the other slasher 'massacre' titles. We may not have even witnessed classics like Halloween. Sometime after his career redefining joint venture with Steven Spielberg (Poltergeist), Hooper fell into an awful run of consistently poor form. Later years saw uninspired efforts like Crocodile, The Mangler and Night Terrors completely ruin his almost peerless resume. It was somewhat ironic then that he decided to direct a remake of the 1978 gruesome slasher (The Toolbox Murders) at exactly the same time that New Line Cinema were renewing his very own masterpiece (Chainsaw Massacre). The original Toolbox flick is a tough act to follow, let alone reproduce. What it lacked in style and quality, it more than made up for with brutality that has never been expressed in such a gratuitous fashion. Some of the gruesomely vicious scenes are almost impossible to forget and seeing a masked maniac use a nail gun to slaughter a naked teenager while he merrily hums away like he's changing a light bulb is a shock tactic has never been used as effectively since. I must admit I hoped for more of the same from Hooper and I knew that he had already proved that he had the quality to break the hex of extremely poor horror remakes.The Lusman Arms is a run down hotel in Hollywood, which has stood since the early twenties. In the opening scene we see a young woman get brutally murdered by a hammer-wielding black shrouded menace in one of the guest-rooms. Her body is dragged into the shadows and it seems that no one notices her disappearance. Next up we meet Nell and Steve Burrows (Angela Bettis and Brent Roam), a young married couple that have only just moved into the Lusman Arms. Steve is a doctor and spends most of his time out of the house, which leaves Nell suffering with her noisy neighbours through the wafer thin walls. Having already mistaken two rehearsing actors for someone being slaughtered, the Local Police are less than impressed with the housewife's overactive imagination. But after hearing the dieing screams of her neighbour, she begins to realise that the complex has more to its history than first meets the eye. Nell eventually heads out to solve the mystery of the disappearing residents, and what she discovers is more shocking than she could ever have expected? Toolbox Murders is something of an impressive return to form from Tobe Hooper. Slasher Movies are always easy templates to unleash some directorial flair and the veteran horror icon seems to lap up the chances to shine with relish. You can tell from the off that this is going to be something of a step up from the typical post-Scream lowbrow trash. Joseph Conlan's impressive score keeps the tension running on a knife-edge, and the set locations prove that the feature has been slickly produced. Hooper does a great job of making an ordinary everyday backdrop like an apartment complex feel as creepy as a haunted castle and the conclusion is as exciting as it is enjoyable. The two lead characters are fairly well acted, and kudos to the scriptwriter for giving the viewer the option to sympathise with the protagonist. There are enough mysterious suspects to partake in a reality TV cluedo marathon and each of them will give you a good enough reason to think that they could be the masked maniac. I especially enjoyed the stuttering manager, who describes a tin full of torn out human teeth that Nell found in her bedroom wall as, "Part of the building's charm and character!" At the time of writing, Toolbox Murders has not yet been released in either the US or the UK on DVD, which is somewhat inexplicable. I'm not sure what kind of business this took at the box offices, but I believe that it does certainly deserve a bigger status. There are a few flaws that perhaps undermine Hooper's experience. The use of stereotypes is beyond belief; and as soon as a creepy toolbox-clutching handyman popped up as a hackneyed red herring, the movie lost a touch of credibility. At times the characters behave with a knack of ineptness that was totally nonsensical and perhaps underlined a lack of effort from the screenwriters. Victims leave themselves open to the killer's murderous advances in such a fashion that makes you wonder if they were suicidal, and the director fails to add anything remotely different to the conclusion. Questions will be raised about the numerous plot holes that are scattered throughout the runtime, but personally I feel that they add an extra layer of mystery to the synopsis. Audiences don't always need to be hand-guided hand through a story. Gaps can be filled by a creative imagination and that is part of the beauty of cinema. Toolbox Murders is not so much a remake of its 1978 ancestor as it is a complete re-imaging. Yes there's a nail gun murder and a similar masked killer theme; but this time around we have an intriguing supernatural sheen, which makes the movie a tad more interesting. All in all this is well worth picking up. Gory (one guy gets his head sawed in half ala Intruder), suspenseful (the final stalking scenes are brilliant) and well watchable to boot, this is Hooper almost back to his best. Let's just hope that he can keep up the good work with his latest adventure - Mortuary (another remake?).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tobe Hooper makes an excellent comeback...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film in a room that's designed to play Horror films and that's all you can see there. This film was made with little money and Tobe hooper's skills show throughout the movie, his ability to play with us, to make our fear rise, our heart beat faster. I thought the atmosphere was great! Basically the story is: Every year thousands of people go to L.A. to pursue their dreams, some succeed...some not. Some end up in the Lusman Building.. The Lusman Building was once a luxurious building, with classy, rich residents. Today, it's an old, spooky and sinister building where you would not want to live and if you did live there, you would want to leave...but could you? It houses a supernatural evil. It's been subdued for decades - but when renovations start, a series of murders take place.This film becomes a mystery as our heroine Nell(Angela Bettis - see her in "May") tries to unravel the secret of the Lusman Building and its residents...it keeps us guessing cause almost everyone is a suspect and Hooper doesn't need big special effects to keep us interested, the story is fast paced and the killings are inventive and gruesome.It's not that kind of film that spends millions of dollars in special effects and scares us only with sharp and loud sounds and tricks like that, no! This film shows a great director, some good actors and a good sinister story that will really scare you in a way that only really good horror movies can...this is no cheap trick or horror movie for 16 year old boys with cheerleader type actresses that show off their assets...this movie is far more interesting and scary than most of the so called horror movies that go to theaters.Like I read in bloody-disgusting.com, " Toolbox is a strong film likely to boost Tobe Hooper back into the top rung of horror directors along with names like Craven, Carpenter, and Romero."Go see a master of horror doing his thing...you will not be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood Occult</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is such a great horror-film, and it has some original-twists to it too. The story centers-around the "Lusman Arms" (really the Ambassador Hotel, once THE place for the Hollywood elite and the site of the RFK assassination), a decaying-Hotel in a seedy part of Los Angeles. It seems after recent-renovations to the structure of the building there have been some strange-occurrences: a workman hurt in an unexplained-blast, and strange electrical-surges. There is a constant-sound of hammering, even when the workmen are gone. Tenants have gone-missing, and a strange aura of oppressiveness has descended-upon the building. It seems the place has a reputation that the building manager (a concierge) doesn't want known. It's just a great film, with a bunch of oddball-characters, unlike the log-jam of boring, PG-13 pseudo-horror. The characters in this film feel real, and I like them. Because I like them, I fear for them, and that is what horror is about.Enter Nell (Angela Bettis of "May") and Steven, two new tenants. We get to know them and some of their backstory, and the decaying-Lusman is literally filled with oddities. For those who have lived in a 1920s-era apartment building, a lot of the funny-parts about maintenance (or the lack-of) will be familiar! If you have ever lived in an old-building, you can attest to the impressions of the past within-the-walls. The ghosts of "old Hollywood" haunt this film, just like they do the films of David Lynch or Kenneth Anger. Let's face it, with the legend of the Black Dahlia (mentioned in the film), the constant-battle for the control of the water-supply (an engineer once controlled L.A. His name was William Mulholland, and designed the Owens Valley Acqueduct), the Manson Family, gangs, poverty, the desert air, all the Hollywood deaths and scandals, cults, Scientology, the Mexican Day of the Dead, Chinatown, drugs, the Ramparts scandals, decades of obscene-corruption--Los Angeles is creepy.Nell notices a lot of hammering and other strange-phenomena, and eventually begins to probe the mystery of the Lusman Arms. This descent-into-hell is what makes this not merely a slasher, but an Occult-horror piece. The Lusman has a strange, esoteric architecture and a storied-past. It also has mysterious symbols covering it's walls in key-locations. The logical-sequence of room numbers are missing some rooms. Some have commented that the symbols are "Masonic", even calling the film "Masonic-horror", which is false and misleading. The symbols are ancient, and have been around for thousands of years, and most should be familiar. I noticed absolutely nothing "Masonic" in the film whatsoever, which is odd. I guess they were reviews by Nazi-skinheads.The best-part of this story is that it connects the enigmatic-tale of Jack Parsons, an occultist Crowley-devotee who founded the Jet-Propulsion Lab, being an early rocketeer. It is said that Parsons claimed to have created an "homunculus", an artificial human-being, so there is a genuine-connection with L.A.'s strange-relationship with occultism here. Parsons blew-himself-up in an alchemical experiment in the late-1940s--exactly where the "Lusman-mythos" begins. Without Jack Parsons, there would be no Scientology: L. Ron Hubbard ripped-him-off in a business-deal and used the money to fund the publishing of "Dianetics". I think the occult-backstory of the killer was Tobe Hooper's idea, and it really draws-you-in. "Occult" comes from archaic-Greek, and merely denotes "hidden", nothing-more. There are many hidden-secrets at the Lusman.The murderer in the film is great, and one could consider it Parson's homunculus in-a-way, though the "coffin-birth" masks this element. I actually thought the "coffin-baby" backstory was interesting, and had the ring of occult-lore to it. Frankly, I would have to agree with some reviewers--if you aren't familiar with occultism, you aren't going to get a lot of the premise here. So, get-familiar kids, study the occult, hah-hah. Nonetheless, it's still a film you can watch superficially, enjoying the many mysteries that Hooper and his writers treat us to. Also, the murders-themselves are pretty original and thrilling, some even gruesome in a way that would do Argento proud! Go-figure, reality isn't what you thought it was! Without giving-away too much, this is a tale of the undead, kept-active by sacred-geometry in the structure of a building. It is a story of the darkness and mystery that surrounds-us, and a story of magic and curiosity. There are so-many incredible images of horror in this film, it is just excellent and intriguing. With a budget of less-than $1 million, Tobe Hooper has created a new classic horror that is likely to be imitated. It is surely "better" than the original film, and is simply his and his writers' take on the source (with major-revisions and additions). It is a re-imagining. The score by Joseph Conlan is very good, and atmospheric, hitting all the right marks. It makes the film feel larger. Toolbox Murders has a lot on-offer for such a little film, and is a great return-to-form for Mr. Hooper. Here's to more from him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If I had a Hammer...and a Nail Gun...and a Drill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the name of Tobe Hooper does not carry the cachet it once did, he still deserves his place amongst the modern masters of horror with the likes of Romero, Argento, Craven, and Cronenberg. Hooper, having never been able to equal the raw energy and success of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre...and never being able to do so in the future...definitely has regained his form with this version of The Toolbox Murders. On the surface I thought I was going to sit through some lame rehashing of an older horror film, but I found myself pleasantly surprised with this high energy, suspenseful, stylish, well-acted film. Evil lurks in the old and dilapidated Lusman Arms, an aging apartment building in severe disrepair with renovation abounding all over. The film opens with a rainy evening and a blonde woman getting the point of the film hammered into her skull. Next, we meet a young couple moving into the apartment building. Beautiful and talented Angela Bettis plays the protagonist of the film as a woman who realizes people are disappearing around her and that the Lusman Arms has some major secrets as well as a demented killer hidden in its walls. Much of the film involves her unraveling of the Arms's secrets, though no full explanation as to how the black arts is incorporated is ever explained. The film is tightly woven from beginning to end by the consummate work of Hooper who knows how to use the camera and gets the most from a largely unknown cast. The actors are peppered with some movie veterans such as Rance Howard giving one heck of a good performance as a man that has lived there virtually his whole life, Juliet Landau as a running girl "headed" for trouble, and the wonderful Greg Travis as the guy in charge of the apartments. Travis had me in stitches with his dialog about the charm of old places like this, etc... Hooper works with some interesting, inventive, and implausible storyline, but he makes the most of it. Here and there Hooper plays homage to others, like the scene where Bettis and husband find old teeth in the wall. An obvious salute to Roman Polanski's The Tenant. While not a great film, The Toolbox Murders delivers. It shows just enough blood without going overboard and has just enough humour in it to balance the unpleasantness of the plot. I was pleasantly surprised on all counts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake was surprisingly enjoyable, despite the low IMDb rating, and perhaps Tobe Hooper's best work since The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Mix some elements of Polanki's Apartment Trilogy with some from TCM, and throw in a few inventive, violent kills ? la the original Toolbox Murders, and you have a rather enjoyable horror movie. Also adding to it is the good performance from up and coming horror starlet Angela Bettis. The killer was pretty cool too; I liked how giddy he was after sprinkling lye on some guy's face, held down by a vice, Casino style! I can only wish I enjoyed my work so. Of course, it's not a flawless movie. The plot maybe could have used a bit more work but if you just go with it, it's really a minor complaint. The DVD has two commentaries (one with Hooper!), deleted scenes (mostly more graphic shots of the kills), a short interview with Hooper, and some trailers, including the great one for High Tension! I'm glad I bought it, despite a hefty $20 tag.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tobe Hooper is Back, Baby!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a fifteen year long string of awful horror movies and forgettable TV shows, director Tobe Hooper finally roars back to life with this fun, scary and intense horror thriller.When I first heard Hooper was remaking TOOLBOX MURDERS, I thought he had hit a new low. The director of THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE is making a remake of a movie that was in many ways a rip-off of CHAINSAW? I didn't think I'd bother.Then I started hearing some internet buzz that the movie was actually pretty good, so I picked up the DVD at a horror convention. I was pleasantly surprised. It's a throwback to Hooper's earlier movies like CHAINSAW, EATEN ALIVE and THE FUNHOUSE, with a similar atmosphere of dementia and claustrophobic terror. The performances are excellent and the screenplay is very good (written by the same team that wrote Hooper's previous film, CROCODILE). Also top notch are the expressionistic cinematography and editing.Hooper's previous movies reeked of TV movie blandness (possibly due to his having slowly moved into that realm over the years), but TOOLBOX MURDERS has a healthy dose of grindhouse grit to go with the slick, professional quality of his hired hand work. The result is a movie that is as technically well-made as SCREAM or WRONG TURN, but with the guts of a 70s drive-in shocker.While the killer finds some creative ways to kill people with various hardware items, and the action takes place in a single apartment building, this movie has little to do with the original TOOLBOX MURDERS. It's actually more similar in plot to Lucio Fulci's HOUSE BY THE Cemetery. However, despite its remake status and its borrowing plot points from a few previous movies, it has a surprisingly fresh and original feeling to it.I'll go out on a limb and say Tobe Hooper's TOOLBOX MURDERS is one of the better horror movies I've seen in quite some time. It leaves the CHAINSAW remake in the dust. It's better than most so-called horror movies I've seen in the last few years.I highly recommend this to horror fans, but especially to admirers of Hooper who thought he would never crawl out of his rut. Well, he's back, and with a vengeance!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A watchable but failed horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this film was OK but nothing great. I mean, I thought Angela Bettis was brilliant in it and was pleased to see that she managed to keep the film from falling totally flat on its ass but that's the film's only saving grace (well, there's another one and I'll get to it in a second). It's certainly intriguing and how the victims meet their demise are slightly fun to see but said deaths are rather uninvolving and exist soley to titillate fans of gore. To me, the deaths were, although very inventive, dull. It did nothing for the movie whatsoever. As a horror, the film fails. Sure, it has cheap scares and plentiful of mystery but those who are bumped off...you don't feel any sympathy for them. Mind you, they're killed off that quickly and easily that it's hard to find any sympathy you may have for them. The only person I had sympathy for was Nell (a la Angela Bettis). Mainly because her character is only one in the film that is close to fully developed. Sure, we are introduced to others but what else?. However, there is another thing apart from Angela Bettis that keeps it going and that's the mystery of it all. When Nell decides to turn detective and investigate the history behind the building and those weird symbols, that's when the films jumps from being merely watchable to actually good. But it all backfires spectacularly when the boyfriend shows up and decides at that moment to save the day. This occurrence spoils the mystery plot line and the climax is just a clichéd stalk-and-slash (and the very Halloween-alike ending was a very bad idea). The mystery storyline is crippled at the end when the killer chooses not to kill Nell there and then because of the symbols on her arm. It was just too ridiculous really. Sure, the secret areas in the building was interesting but all because of black arts? Nah. The reason this element doesn't work is because it's supposed to be a horror/drama not sci-fi horror. Although the film does give early implications that the explanation for everything may be otherworldly ie the ominous music when Nell looks at the symbol near the start of the movie, it just doesn't work.Overall, the film isn't a complete waste of time and doles out a few guilty pleasures to horror fans easily pleased, but for those, like me, who like their horrors well-done, this just isn't one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much better than you'd expect, given Hooper's recent track record.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nell and Steven move into a run-down Hollywood apartment in the middle of being renovated. They soon realize that the landlord, maintenance man, and other tenants are a strange bunch. Nell finds herself delving into a mystery of the building when one of her neighbors goes missing. This is an excellent and unique slasher. Considering the last movie I saw by Hooper was about a CGI crocodile, I think it is fair to say he is back in the game. Unfortunately, there are plot holes galore that should have been worked out, the pacing is somewhat uneven, and the ending is a big let-down. But the murder scenes are nasty, the atmosphere is creepy, the set is awesome, and the jump scares are worthy. The "city of broken dreams" theme is effective even though most of the film takes place within the claustrophobia of the apartment building. The performance by Angela Bettis ("May") really anchors the movie. This lady brings a sense of dignity and classiness to the horror genre and I think she could become a real genre pioneer. All horror fans should check-out this movie.My Rating: 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Slash Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Hollywood, the young teacher Nell (Angela Bettis) and her husband, the resident Steven Barrows (Brent Roam), move to an old building called Lusman Arms. Some sixty years ago, the place was glamorous, but presently is completely decadent, inclusive many dwellers have disappeared along the years. While her husband is working in the hospital, the lonely Nell hears some weird noises and becomes afraid of the place. While jogging, she is introduced and becomes close to her neighbor Julia Cunningham (Juliet Landau) and they schedule a hike together on the next day. Julia never shows up, and Nell looks for her in the building, finding a hiding block behind the wall, where an evil being, which was born from death, lives with many dead bodies."Toolbox Murders" is a great slash movie. The gore story presents original deaths and is well tied in, and Tobe Hooper seems to have recovered his "old shape" of great and talented director of horror movies. Other attractions are Angela Bettis, the "May Dove Canady" of the cult-movie "May", and Juliet Landau, the "Drusilla" of Angel. I particularly was very impressed with the initial death with a hammer: without being explicit and only listening to the beating of the hammer, the scene is very impressive. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Noites de Terror" ("Nights of Terror")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently saw this remake last weekend in LA, during which it was being shown on a limited sneak peak basis. Apparently, it's still in limbo on weather to go as a theatrical release or direct to video.What I got was a well crafted horror remake that drifted away from the original. Yes, it's a remake, but Tobe (Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1&amp;2) Hooper makes this picture all worth while. As we address the title of the film, all is implied with a hammer, a vice, a nail gun and a drill. Those tools are to just name a select few. The story takes place in LA, where a young couple move into an old run down apartment complex that is also rented out to tenants that are wannabe actors and sleeze bag drug users. One by one, they fall victim to our Toolbox Murderer. It's not my favorite Hooper film, but it's a lot better compared to "Crocodile" and "The Mangler." I particularly am pleased with the gory death scenes, as well as the style of Hooper's directing. That apartment complex that was used was just awesome. Overall this slasher flick delivered in such a way that I'd like purchase it for my horror collection.8/10 Way to go Tobe!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tobe Hooper's 2003 version of the Toolbox Murders is a fun little movie. It's a bloody good time to watch, although it's not scary, but the fun factor makes up for it. I haven't seen the original, but I'm sure it's better than it. The middle part drags a little bit, but once the main character stumbles apon the "hidden" portion of her apartment building, the fun and action begins! Props to Tobe Hooper for a great and well done opening sequence. Most films that have somebody killed in the beginning have the next scene take place somewhere else or on the next day, the scene after it takes place the second after it! I give it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT* The first "Toolbox Murders" was a film that demanded a remake. They started with a great idea, (Psycho killing women with power tools), but then proceeded to waste it by having the psycho blab on and on to one of his victims. The new "Toolbox Murders" doesn't waste time with a lot of blah, blah, blah. The title says Toolbox Murders and that's what you get."Toolbox Murders" is a fine film. It's top quality for a straight to video flick. It could have easily played in theaters. So once again, Toolbox Murders are raging at an apartment building. A motley crew of misfits and cretins are hanging around to get slaughtered. The girl from "May" moves in as well. She's on a quest to prove that there's something very wrong with this building. She may be right as all of the tenants keep disappearing. Soon the madman will make his appearance and many power tools will be unleashed on the hapless inhabitants.While I enjoyed this gory flick, there was one crucial scene from the first movie that should have been updated. Who could forget the famous scene where the naked chick leaps out of the bathtub and runs for her life from a guy with a nailgun? While a nailgun does make an appearance in the new version, it is a fairly tame death compared to the first "Toolbox Murders". I'll give the original points for their nailgun death scene. For everything else, this version is the winner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't sure how I felt about this movie until about a day after I watched it. I've come to the conclusion that it was mediocre. It felt like a revisit of every bad slasher flick I'd seen for the last 20 years. I do have to give credit to Tobe for humanizing some of the victims. Let's be honest, in the typical slasher flick the victims are usually drunken or doped up, teen-age sex fiends that you could care less about(and may actually enjoy seeing them get taken out:) The killer is equal parts psycho/supernatural, and his origins, limitations, and needs are never fully explained. Overall, there were some fairly grisly offings, decent character acting, but too many plot holes for me to overlook. Rent, don't buy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you manage to sit through the first 80 minutes, you'll be rewarded with... actually, nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes are always a tricky business, and this worthless outing investigates what happens when a formerly influential director sets out to re-imagine a film that wasn't all that great to begin with. Perhaps predictably, the result is a dreadful and mirthless mess that almost dares you to make it to the finish line.Only the title ties this film to the semi-infamous original, and since most of the murders here are committed with implements that wouldn't fit in a toolbox, we have to wonder why director Tobe Hooper even bothered with the reference. Perhaps "The Workbench Murders" would have been more accurate? While the source film at least tried to throw a whodunnit into the mix, all we get here is a cast of completely unlikeable and thoroughly annoying characters being offed one by one by a black-clad fiend armed with an bevy of home improvement aids. Even with this simplistic concept in place, we could have had enough material for a passable slasher film, but Hooper instead tries to explain away his bloodbath with a convoluted plot that presents the apartment building that houses the murders as a nexus of evil forces where a sadistic psychopath runs rampant because of an ancient spell that is built into the structure. You see, our killer was a "coffin birth", and he dwells in a secret townhouse hidden within the apartment complex, and the spell keeps him trapped, but renovations to the building broke the spell, and now he's free to kill the idiotic archetypes who live in the building, and he's a marksman with a nail gun. Oh, and our leading lady is the "chosen one" who was supposed to discover all of this and face the killer to stop the evil for all time.You still with me? I didn't think so.If this were just a standard a B-horror film (like the original), The Toolbox Murders might get away with such nonsense. But, since this film was delivered from the hands of the same man who made the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, we can't help but expect something more here. While the film itself offers no suspense or scares to speak of, Hooper's inability to forge a coherent narrative is a bit unsettling.He certainly doesn't get any help from his actors, who play their roles as if they were given two-word synopses of their characters: "creepy handyman", "clueless manager", "wacky neighbor", etc. None of the supporting cast has any depth beyond "future victim", so it's pretty easy to predict early on who's going to be around for the final reel.Once the killer is revealed, the film spirals into a flurry of improbabilities, the absurd low point of which finds our fiendish murderer trying to chop our heroine in half by strapping her to a table saw and positioning the blade in front of her crotch. This is also one of those films where characters you swore were dead just seconds before magically reappear to save the day, and where killers you swore were dead just seconds before leap "unexpectedly" through a window for one "last scare".The most insulting aspect of the entire film is the finale, which finds our heroine repelling the killer by defending herself with magic marker drawings on her arms (don't ask), and unabashedly demands a sequel to this stupid affair once we find out that our villain really isn't defeated (although to be fair, if magic marker drawings and being hung by an easily-unpluggable extension chord didn't stop him, I'm out of ideas myself).While the original Toolbox Murders was far from classic, at least it carried the charm of ineptness. But those who created this piece of crap really should have known better. As it stands, aside from the nostalgia generated by setting the action in a now-destroyed Los Angeles landmark, this Toolbox is empty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Astonishingly Boring and Derivative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was extremely excited to hear that a new Tobe Hooper movie was coming out starring no less than Angela Bettis. I loved both the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and May, so I was really interested in how the pairing would work. Who would have guessed that it would be one of the most amateurish movies I've ever seen? From the script up, the film is boring, silly, and derivative. Jace Anderson and Adam Gierasch, who between them have left a wake of terrible movies, put absolutely no effort into writing a halfway decent script, instead randomly referencing other, better films. There's a girl who's convinced the building is evil, but nobody believes her! Oh, right: Rosemary's Baby. And she finds teeth in the walls! Oh, right: The Tenant. Even Hooper's own Massacre is whored out here in the facially disfigured, nonverbal killer. And, sadly, the direction just does not pick up the slack left in the script. It looks like a TV movie, extremely workmanlike with entire sequences so badly lit, shot, and edited it's difficult to even tell what's going on.I don't know how a film with such a well-known director and star ends up looking like an awful low budget first time director's work. I really wanted this to be better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Reading some of the reviews on here I got excited, very excited. Chainsaw is one of the best horror movies ever made, and the chance that Tobe Hooper could be back to his original form had me buying instead of renting.Big mistake. A stupid film. Buildings within buildings, missing rooms, a mad-man powered by magic spells, pseudo-Chainsaw corpses all over the place and the lamest "is he dead" ending.It's the sort of movie I'd expect Wes Craven to make; low budget, no brainer/no scares nonsense.Gorehounds may enjoy the killings but I found them lacklustre and unconvincing. Haute Tension (Switchblade Romance) pulled off the angle-grinder/stone-cutter killing with a lot more class.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great reception at the Hollywood Egyptian premier.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Hollywood Egyptian showing apparently was the US opening of this very scary and shock-filled treat, and a part of the theater's annual Sci-Fi and Horror festival. The audience was obviously enjoying Tobe Hooper's return to his roots with this superb version of the old cult gore flick from the late 70s of the same name. Tobe Hooper himself was present and gave some insight into the whole development and storyline of the film, and he got an outstanding reception. The first film to ever make me really jump was the original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", and this one is only the second one to do it, and I've seen practically every horror film made in the years between. With that being said, I suggest that if you're ready for a scare, this will deliver. It has some of the good elements from other Hooper films that were good but missed the mark somehow, like The Funhouse. In fact, the killer in this flick seems to be part Leatherface and part Funhouse mutation, with a whole lot of new stuff too. Argento has an equal in Tobe Hopper with this American "giallo" film, Toolbox Murders.</fullReview>

They shot him, hung him, stabbed him, pushed a wall on top of him, and he still didn't die. He didn't even have a name. He wasn't even a character. Oh yeah and another thing! How could you have like 100 dead bodies in a building without anyone noticing they were missing??

		<shortDescription>Hooper's best in a long long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to believe that the man who 30 years ago gave us what is probably the best horror movie ever done, the powerful Texas Chain Saw Massacre, went through 30 years of movies with mixed results. Fortunately, Tobe Hooper returns with a decent movie that finally manages to live up to the enormous fame of his legendary debut.Reimagining an obscure 70s movie, Hooper sets his story in present day Hollywood, where a young married couple moves to the Lusman, an old building. Angela Bettis, the actress who surprised the world in "May", stars as Nell, who is not happy with his husband choice of moving to the Lusman. She'll find a contrived plot and gory killings as Julia, her neighbor and new friend suddenly disappears without a trace.Bettis carries the film with grace, and power. This young woman definitely has a bright future in films. While the rest of the cast is average in their performance, Hooper's direction is the star as he turns the building into another character. The locations are awesome and the atmosphere Hooper uses is very creepy and filled with tension.The movie flows well as a mixture of a "whodunit" mystery and a gory slasher. The gore is an important factor here, and it is well delivered. Probably he is not a great director, but Hooper knows how to pull up great murder scenes from his actors.The flaws of the movie lay in the script, it is filled with enough plot holes to be a problem. Fortunately, it's creepy atmosphere and the high tension it creates almost make up for this big flaw, although it is still noticeable.Tobe Hooper may be an uneven director who had a very lucky debut with "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", but here he gives us a very entertaining movie that really makes up for the 30 years of average movies he did. A very pleasant surprise. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was by far...the worst....horror movie ever written. There is absolutely no plot at all. The movie follows one character around, who is Heartbroken(!) by learning a friend is missing after meeting her one hour before. Instead of leaving this crap-hole apartment, she decides to solve the mystery. She learns of a curse, 15 minute before the movie concludes. The killer is no one introduced in the movie, at the end we find out, he is a mummy figure. The movies ends, plot less, with the killer escaping after being hanged out from 14 stories through a window. Awful...god awful. I advise someone to see this only (!) if they don't anticipate seeing a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Daisy has come to Hollywood to pursue her dreams. The apartment and surrounding areas where she lives are less than salubrious so she is confident her personal taser will halt any unwanted advances. With that kind of forethought, it is only ever a matter of time before she's beaten to death. It happens with a hammer in the ? currently under renovation ? 'luxury' hotel, The Lusman Arms where she was staying. This place is populated by OTT stereotypes who are mainly played as caricatures. This gives The Lusman Arms a heightened sense of reality in which new arrivals Nell and Steven, refreshingly normal, seem instantly out of place.Nell meets Chas Rooker, an elderly resident, whose job it is to provide (a) a sympathetic voice of reason, and (b) a lot of the back-story concerning how Jack Lusman, an occultist who built the place, mysteriously disappeared many years ago.When the (implausibly and awkwardly framed) attacks come from the black-clad killer ? utilising hammers, drills etc ? the victims have proved to be so ridiculously excessive in character, the murders take on a cartoonish aspect, which I find neither terrifying or particularly amusing. Only towards the end, when the killer's face is revealed in a long shot as he shrieks and howls like an animal in torment, does any sense of fear emerge. The stings and whirls of the incidental music that have been trying to convince us to be scared since the beginning, finally have some horror to embrace.The idea of the building being cursed, and the killer being a 'coffin birth, born of death' is fascinating but is only briefly touched on. His possible spectral existence seems to have been eschewed in favour of whacky characterisations of the residents. This is a shame. The final 'he's dead ? no he's not ? yes he is ? no he's not' is inevitable before the thrash metal screams of the closing music roll over the credits.The performances verge from the capable to the unconvincing (an abusive punk rocker is less than threatening). Only Angela Bettis as Nell really impresses, making the most of her character. She had proved excellent in the 2002 film 'May', in which she played a sympathetic outcast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was what it was...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will start with saying that I am usually quite anti-remake, but this 2004 version of "The Toolbox Murders" was adequate. Tobe Hooper managed to capture the late 1970s essence and transcribe it to a modern version.While "The Toolbox Murders" is not a horror masterpiece, then it is still entertaining enough for what it was. What worked for me was the pseudo-supernatural element of the story. As for scares and such, then the movie is a most other slasher movies.The movie was predictable, yes. But then again, so are many slasher/horror movies. The story was adequately paced, although there were actually many deaths throughout the entire movie.It was essentially the cast that saved the movie, in particular Angela Bettis.This isn't Tobe Hooper's best movie, not by a long shot."The Toolbox Murders" isn't particularly outstanding amidst the countless movies in the horror genre, and as such I am rating it a mere five out of ten stars. This is the type of movie you Watch once, then put the movie away with a very unlikely'chance of ever watching it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seems Some Reviewers are Easily Satisfied</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see reviews calling this a "Return to greatness" or other such hyperbolic praise. I couldn't disagree more. This is a mediocre, forgettable slasher film that really displays nothing impressive that would mark this as the work of a Master of Horror. In fact, the more I re-watch Hooper's catalog, the more I think that title may not belong to him, at all. TCM is my favorite horror film of all time, but reading Hansen's CHAINSAW CONFIDENTIAL intimates that much of the success belongs more to decision made by Hooper's crew than by the director himself. What else has he really made? SALEM'S LOT is a bland TV movie, indicative of its' time. There is nothing impressive about the directorial work. Most of the praise belongs to the source material written by King. Same with POLTERGEIST, which many cinephiles would argue is mostly the work of Spielberg. What's left are some minor films like EATEN ALIVE and THE FUNHOUSE, which I do enjoy, but are far from masterpieces, so while this may not be a return to greatness, perhaps it is fairly representative of the majority of the man's work.I digress far too much, though, from reviewing this movie itself. This was my second viewing, almost a decade apart. I seemed to have fonder memories than what I saw as I re-watched the movie this past week. From the opening kill, featuring Sherri Moon Zombie, we quickly see that the director really has no sense of how to create terror or suspense. It's formulaic and predictable and the only thing really going for it is a gory sense of brutality that is fun, indeed, but nothing which would set it apart from tons of other slashers.From there, we get a rapid succession of other kills, featuring creative ways to use the titular toolbox to dispatch victims, but let's face it, all of this is retread from a zillion 80s VHS boom slashers, many of which gave us nail-guns, hammers, drills and these other weapons of murder. That leaves the movie to rely on its' story to set it apart from the rest of the pack and that's mostly where it fails.In typical horror movie fashion events unwind far too quickly. All of these people have been living in this hotel forever, yet suddenly the "monster" decides to whack them all within days? There are bodies stacked everywhere in the monster's lair, but no one in this hotel noticed the pattern of death that had to be present in order to create a body count that high? Maybe I'm expecting too much from my horror movies, though.The plot mainly revolves around Angela Bettis as the new resident, discovering dark secrets in the architecture of the hotel and occult symbols which have given dark power to a disfigured monster living deep within its' bowels. Again, just an amalgamation of tropes seen in dozens of other horror movies since the dawn of cinema and not even blended in any way creatively or artistically. The story goes that Hooper lost financing partway through his filming and had cobble together a movie out of bits and pieces that he had already filmed and it shows, as the movie is full of holes and plot rushes.If you're just looking for a mindless slasher with some blood, I guess this might fit the bill, but don't expect it to be anything more than a retread of the golden age of 80s slasher films prettied up with some 21st century gloss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert!!! OK I must say this slasher film really does have it's moments where it drags on but I must say the environment is a little bit cooler looking than it is in the original. Here the apartment building looks like a place where a killer really would hide in order to murder his victims successfully. In the original if you noticed it wasn't too hard to spot where the killer would appear because he really only attacked at night from what I remember. Here though the killer attacks and murders both at night and during the day which adds a little bit more tension. The killer at the end is revealed to have red eyes which I think symbolizes that he is either a demon or he's just a whacko who enjoys wearing eye contacts, it really makes you wonder. I noticed a majority of the characters were creepy to hide the killer's identity and they never say who it is even in the end. It truly is interesting even though it kind of drags a little bit here and there. I give it a 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Remake with the great Angela Bettis!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1974 Tobe Hooper directed the original horror masterpiece "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and created and instant name for himself. But over the past few decades he really hasn't done anything to write home about. Except that in 2004 he directed Angela Bettis in a remake of the 1978 film "The Toolbox Murders".This new version stars Bettis as Nell as she and her husband move into the Lusman Arms apartment complex in Los Angeles. The complex in under an extensive renovation and is a complete mess, but they have a doorman. The story feels like a lost film from Roman Polanski, drawing a lot from the themes of "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Tenant". The story also throws in a bit of old Hollywood noir, as the apartment building was the former residence of the infamous Black Dahlia victim Elizabeth Short. The building is a character in itself as a dark and foreboding presence. The movie was shot at the old Ambassador Hotel which has a pretty storied past in itself. The Lusman Arms is the place where young actors come with dreams of making it big. Although Nell is a school teacher and her husband Steve and med student.From the first scene of the movie we know that there is a ski masked maniac in the building who is killing off the resident and things seem to point towards Ned the quiet and creepy young maintenance man who kind of looks like Jack White. Like the original film he kills his victims with various tools in his toolbox, so yeah the title is pretty self explanatory.Nell immediately gets the creeps about the place, but its so affordable since they have to live in a construction zone. We get to know a lot of the residents from an old man who has lived there for 60 years, to the young couple that is always fighting, and the middle aged couple with a teenage son. After hearing a bunch of screaming from next door Nell calls the cops, but they find nothing. She is all alone with her mind allowed to wonder and with the paper thin walls she can't get a moment of silence. As the terror and suspense increases Nell starts to investigate the history of the Lusman Arms. Acting on a tip from the Old Man she find that each floor is missing a room and that something sinister lurks within the walls.This is a fun little movie that is all about Angela Bettis and her character Nell as she fights for not only her life but for her sanity. The "Toolbox Murders" DVD is available online or from Netflix and includes a couple of commentary tracks and some deleted scenes. So I guess you should put the Hot Pocket down and go watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Angela Bettis great as always, lovely realistic characters. Other than that - nothing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a horror-freak spectator, I must say I did not enjoy this film as much as I'd hoped I would.Angela Bettis was the best part for me. I loved her in all her previous parts in Girl Interrupted, May and Carrie, and find her an excellent actress, way underrated. In this film, we got to see her playing a different role, rather than the disturbed neurotic she usually plays. She did so beautifully, and I hope directors learn to appreciate her as she deserves!The characters were also great. Realistic, original, varied and convincing. I found myself curious and compelled by each of their stories, and wanting to know more about them.Unfortunately - that was it. The main story wasn't all that interesting, too many questions left unasked rather than unanswered. Not enough explanations about the supernatural aspect, and not at all enough information about the killer. Speaking of the killer - he wasn't all that scary, not at all. As for surprising twists? If there were any, I missed them. The ending was unclear, and anticlimactic. For me - the second I have to use that term (anticlimactic) to describe the ending of a horror film, it means it wasn't that good.I didn't actually see the original film, and at first didn't even know this was a remake. However, I've seen my share of slasher-horror films, and this one certainly isn't one of the best. I've seen some very positive reviews for this film, and I admit to failing to understand why. A matter of taste I guess.Can't really recommend this film with a clean conscience, unless you're a fan of the original one, or of Angela Bettis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake that is actually better than the original. Well that is probably a first (well that I can think of anyway).Directed by Tobe Hopper his best movie in years since his hey days (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Eaten Alive &amp; Funhouse). For a start I wouldn't really call this a remake, as it's in name only, the story is almost completely different and as a movie in its own right I'd say that this is a pretty decent movie. The Plot = A young teacher Nell moves into an old apartment complex with her husband Steven, a building with a mysterious past. After Nell's friend disappears and several tenants start getting murdered, Nell decides to investigate the building's sordid past and who's behind these murders.The tone of this movie takes a completely different turn to the original, not that it's a bad thing, in fact it features some pretty decent performances (something the original lacked), especially Angela Bettis who plays the young teacher, turns in a solid and well rounded performance I also enjoyed her in one of her earlier horror movies "May", a radically different role to this one, as she's more straight forward in this one. As for this film, Tobe Hooper proves that he's still got that magic touch, with its generally creepy atmosphere, solid set pieces and fast paced, which is always a bonus. Okay this movie is the general standard Slasher movie fare. But it keeps you hooked from beginning to end with some decent kills and has that old school feel to it.Okay there are some low points, like none of the other cast are fleshed out, they're just cardboard cut outs, apart from Angela Bettis, none of them are remotely memorable, but that often happens in these types of movies. And some of the plot scenes doesn't really go anywhere, like the mysterious symbols and curses that are found, but this part of the story falls flat and certain things aren't explained very well leaving massive plot holes, like towards the end seems rushed and left a lot of questions unanswered.All in all "Toolbox Murders" definitely improves on the original version, Tobe Hooper shows us that he's still got what it takes, but this doesn't quite reach the heights of some of the classic and won't be as well remembered in years to come, but it's a pretty decent movie, with some effective deaths and a creepy killer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Effective Tool That Could Have Used Some Sharpening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of the 1978 film of the same name, "The Toolbox Murders" is a return from director Tobe Hooper to his suspense/slasher roots. Angela Bettis ("May") stars as Nell, an out-of-work teacher who has just recently moved to a decrepit apartment building in Hollywood. During the day, her husband works, so naturally she runs into a little trouble and as neighbors start disappearing, a disturbing secret about the building comes to light. Is it infested with rats? Is the rent about to go up? Does Seinfeld's Newman store mail in its hollowed out walls? Watch, and find out.Like Hooper's infamous "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (and to a lesser extent, the under-appreciated but wholly worthwhile "The Funhouse"), "The Toolbox Murders" is a slow and steady slasher that builds to its conclusion. Thanks to some slick directing and an effectively creepy setting, the film has a dirty and grimy atmosphere seen too little in more modern slashers. Also in the film's favor is the decade's unsung Scream-queen Angela Bettis, who keeps the film grounded and is likable and credible enough that you want to follow her for an entire film. Of course, that's to say nothing of the often graphic and applause-worthy carnage at hand. Those itching for some good late '70s/early '80s brutality will walk away feeling rather satisfied.Unfortunately, the film is a bit by-the-numbers and suffers from its predictable nature. You may not see the film's twist coming right away, but you can be sure you'll figure who bites it and probably in what order. The film is filled to the brim with stock characters from the quirky neighbor to the creepy maintenance guy which tends to work against the solid performance by Bettis. Rarely does the film break away from convention, and although its throwback feel is refreshing, it gets a bit stale by the end and gives one the impression that Hooper directed the film in his sleep (and without the aid of Spielberg this time).In short, "The Toolbox Murders" is an efficient slasher romp that offers little in the way of surprises. But as a character in the film would say, that's just part of the movie's charm. The film is very much in the spirit of Hooper's earlier work and fans of the bygone golden age of slashers will get the most mileage from it than anyone else. Just go into it with limited expectations and you'll find it to be a decent way to kill 90 minutes.</fullReview>

This is not as great or as intriguing as, let's say, Saw, BUT I do think its definitely worth a viewing i fits free on SyFy haha.

The killer was also mean and psychotic in a proper way although the murders in the beginning of the movie weren't that special and some victims just begged to be killed. The bad visual effects degrade slightly the enjoyment of the movie. Sad but true. It's still very much a worthy watch for the horror fans. Rent or buy it if you see it cheap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly not the worst of Hooper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone was terrified the first they heard Tobe Hooper was working on a movie named after one of the worst films in late 70's. And everyone really thought this was gonna be a pure remake film. But when you think about it, making a remake of a bad movie would be lot smarter than trying to reach the same success than old and good movies. Anyhow, this IS NOT A REMAKE. It only borrows the title, and throws in a new story underneath.We are introduced to an old hotel in LA, which is being renovated. Right after the reconstruction is started, weird and violent deaths begin to appear in the building. Turns out someone is harvesting the residents with everything you can find in an ordinary toolbox. The main character played by terrific Angela Bettis starts investigating the events and is about to find out a horrible truth that lives inside the walls of this mysterious house..Angela Bettis really carries the average story forward with her magnificent performance. There is an actress who is able to adapt in various kind of roles with no problems at all. Also Hooper shows signs of improvement. His direction is sharpest it has been in a long time, although the film starts off pretty lazy. Towards the ending he actually reaches a very chilly and creepy in a sick kind of a way atmosphere, plus there hasn't been any sparing of expenses what comes to gore.Hooper still has a long way up to reach the same disturbed dimensions that The Texas Chainsaw had. But this movie proves he still has the potential, the only question remains: Why doesn't he use it? I give it six stars for the gore, Angela Bettis and several moments of creepiness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best slasher films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Toolbox Murders" is one of the best remakes made recently.**SPOILERS**The Lusman Arms apartment building is being renovated to fit in to modern times. The old building has so many things wrong with it that the list of complaints has reached a crucial point for newlyweds Nell (Angela Bettis) and Steven Barrows, (Brent Roam) who are trying to move into the building during a raging thunderstorm. As they try to settle in, they meet the eclectic residents: Byron McLieb (Greg Travis) the, Ned (Adam Gierasch) the local handyman, Luis Saucedo, (Marco Rodriquez) the doorman, and Chas Rooker, (Rance Howard) the oldest living tenant in the building. Also residents of the building are several wanna-be actors, Julia Cunningham, (Juliet Landau) Saffron Kirby, (Sara Downing) and () who is easily the most convincing of the three. After several days have gone by and the weirdness of the building settling in on Nell, and one-by-one, the other tenants start disappearing. Nell takes it upon herself to solve the disappearances, and finds a masked killer wandering around killing the tenants with different tools.The Good News: Wow, was I impressed with this one. I never really got into the original for two reasons: I thought it was the same movie as The Driller Killer, and it wasn't as gory as its "Video Nastie" title seemed to warrant. It was a nice slasher film for it's time, but I thought it could've been so much more. This one is a lot better and much creepier. The attacks by the killer are actually pretty scary. The elevator attack is my favorite. A guy enters the elevator to leave the building, then it stops, then stops, then starts up again. Getting frustrated, he slams against the control panel, then a gloved hand comes down from the ceiling and pulls up out of the elevator. Moments later, when Nell enters the elevator, we hear the vicious sound of his demise. That is mostly typical of this movie: we hear things more than we see, and that sets up the power of suggestion. That is so rare in today's horror movies that it is very welcome to me. Granted, some murders are seen on-screen, but most are implied, with us seeing the aftermath. One of the best scenes to illustrate this is the spectacular opening. A woman goes into her apartment wanting to take in the night, and she notices her front door is open. Going to check it out, a man in black leaps out of the darkness and attacks her with a hammer, and after a small skirmish, she is killed by the maniac. It seems short, but the buildup is so brilliantly executed that the suspense is wrung out of the scene like no other director can. This is probably Hooper's best film since "Poltergeist," but this is much more violent. The killings are pretty impressive. We get a power drill through the mouth, a hammer claw used as a slashing weapon, a pair of hedge clippers to chop up the back, being shot up with a nail gun, and being carved up with a chisel, among the other killings. It's great that he practically used everything in a toolbox as murder weapons. Some are so creative that I don't want to spoil them here, just seeing them in film will come as a complete surprise. Without a doubt, the last twenty minutes are so action-packed and thrilling that you don't want to look away. Once the secret of the building is revealed and Nell has to escape repeated confrontations with the killer, who also begins stalking the ones who's after Nell because she knows the secret about the killer, it becomes a giant free-for-all of shocks and gore that are so exciting to watch Hooper has to be commended for keeping it all linear and focused.The Bad News: Aside from a pretty slow beginning that was mainly used as a way to exposition needed for the characters, this was a great slasher film.The Final Verdict: The comeback of the year! Hooper has made a film that should rival David Cronenberg's "The Fly" as a brilliant remake that surpasses the original. It has it all: cool deaths, a creepy surrounding, an all-star cast, lots of suspense and plenty of gore. All horror movie fans, not just slasher fans, should check this one out.Rated R: Graphic Violence and some Language</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The harsh routine of slashing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course TOOLBOX MURDERS is a work of routine but in a way it has some energy that most of the slasher remakes and sequels today don't have: it feels as if you watch a debut movie by an enthusiast young filmmaker who doesn't give a s-t on opinions, trends and money and so it has got much of some kind of 80s and 70s spirit. It is well entertaining and if you forget the fact that you have watched HALLOWEEN or Friday 13th or whatever a s--tload of times, you'll have your fun.SPOILER: The only thing which is quite obvious and embarrassing is the ending which is totally similar to the original HALLOWEEN...But anyway: the violence is very grim and shocking in a way that most blockbuster horror flicks of our time don't have. Try it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Nell (Angela Bettis) and Steven (Brent Roam) Barrows move into the historic Lusman building, things start going terribly wrong in Tobe Hoopers remake of "Toolbox Murders". Nell finds a box in her apartment with some human teeth in it, her noisy neighbor Saffron (Sara Downing) gets suddenly very quiet, and her new friend and fellow tenant Julia (Juliet Landau) suddenly disappears. Nell, who spends her days all alone while her husband works as a resident doctor at the local hospital, is plagued with these and all sorts of mysteries throughout the movie. As things get weirder, and the tenants of the Lusman began vanishing, Nell goes on a quest to learn the history of the Lusman in an attempt to sort out the odd occurrences surrounding her. Of course, she ends up with way more than she bargained for. Bettis (as usual) is great in her role. She holds the film together, but she can't save it. Too many plot twists, not enough explanation, and a confusing third act make the whole movie tough to follow. However, "Toolbox Murders" has a lot going for it as well. It's stylish, it's creepy, and at times it's just downright fun. I jumped through a couple scenes, and was on edge for several other. The principle photography and atmosphere of the film are very pleasing. There is also some pretty good death sequences, which really do take you back to the classic slasher films of the 70's and 80's. I enjoyed "Toolbox Murders". Not Tobe's best work, but I can see what he was going for and I believe he achieved it. Horror movies rarely come full circle (in one film), and usually leave us wanting and needing more. "Toolbox Murders" is certainly no exception, but it does deliver a solid performance (Bettis), reasonable and sufficient gore, and a few good screams &amp; laughs for the genuine horror fans out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as Grisly as it could have been.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having missed the limited theatrical release of the the revamped update of the supposed classic, I jumped at the chance to view the movie within the confines of my own little home. Now for all my days i've always had a strong attraction to horror movies, not for the gore although that is par for the course when you watch a movie with the said genre specifics, but more so for a good little story.Now having read an article in Fangoria about the new version, prior to its debut on video/DVD, i was intrigued by the notion that the scripting duties were being left to the writing duo of Adam Gierasch and Jace Anderson, didn't exactly fill me with comfort, having watched some of their previous efforts like 'Crocodile' and its less than glorious sequel as well as 'Spiders', if you couple this with a director whose film-making career appears to be on the wane, none of these ingredients would make for promising viewing.Especially more so if you watch a movie of this kind in the company of your girlfriend, not a wise movie. Anyway, harking back to the original, from what i've read, never actually having seen the original, the movie had no real substance or even for that matter character development. A nice change of pace then when you discover that the writers conjured up a story about old Hollywood and the many secrets that lurked within.Why even having Rance Howard turning up in the movie added a certain touch of class to the proceedings, even if his role although pivotal was but minor. The main star of the show was Angela Bettis, hot off the creepy classic 'May'appearing as a young waif like married woman living in a new 'old style apartment complex with her doctor husband who is periodically at home but mostly tending to the sick and the bewildered, strange to use such a word, when the majority of the inhabitants of the Lussman Arms are just that.Creepy and Kooky, as all should be when they appear in a dark and foreboding horror movie, why if you look close enough you'll notice the presence of co writer Adam Gierasch appearing as the not so handyman 'Ned' he doesn't say much, he just creeps around with his hair in his eyes, lusting after Juliet Landau.Upon viewing it, if memory serves, the release over here in the U.K. was certificate 18, having been released to video/DVD the version i watched was only certificate 15, lessening the impact when you watch the demise of half the cast. Some things in life we can live with, i know that Anchor Bay will release an uncut version, and i must be honest here, i'm into watching a movie, whereby the physical features of the screen villain mostly obscured, be it under the ski mask or by the intentions of the director to keep the killer's face a secret up until the bitter end.Although the artwork released over here in the U.K. basically reveals all, as did the feature in the issue of Fangoria, but hey why complain, which is what my girlfriend did, even though she was the one who hired the movie for me. Not only did she use me as a body shield during the less than gory moments, she also sought to judge the movie before it had even ended.All in all, not too bad,Not as grisly as it could have been or as involving as it should have been, God knows i've watched worse. My only hope, judging by how the movie ended, is that they don't make a follow up. Not every movie needs one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TOBE HOOPER, who is probably best remembered for his terrific Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE (1974) &amp; POLTERGEIST helms this dreary looking, sometimes slow moving horror hit, a young couple moves into a run down apartment complex &amp; soon there after, the wife begins to suspect that the missing residents in the apartment have been murdered, but by whom or what?. Tobe Hooper's remake of the original 1978 horror film (Which I am yet to see) is too slow moving &amp; uninteresting to be any good. Some gross &amp; interesting kills abound here &amp; there, but they are all few &amp; far between. The last twenty minutes of the film is eerie &amp; suspenseful &amp; the villain of the movie is interesting, if only he had been put into a better movie he could have been up there with the slasher greats like JASON, MICHAEL &amp; FREDDY etc. but you may very well find yourself dozing off before the film reaches it's suspenseful climax. The ending also leaves a set up for a sequel. Not the worst film of it's type, but not too good either. Horror fans might want to give it a shot, for the interesting killer &amp; gruesome murders, but chances are they won't find much to win them over.** (stars)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm so glad for you, Tobe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I bought this movie, I was so impatient to get home and watch it. And... I got more than I expected. I watched it, then I went out to fix some business. When I came back, I watched it again. The next day either I couldn't help myself. I watched it again. I'm not a sadist or a psycho. Besides, the movie is not psychologically hard to watch, it's not so violent. I'm just glad for Hooper.-Tobe, you are the genius. I knew it. Perhaps I couldn't judge objectively because of being Hooper's fan. I was really waiting for him to do something like this, something that would be a real success after a decade of silence and failures. In 1995 after "The Mangler" perhaps for himself too it became clear he couldn't go on like that any more. So he went into TV, not just to get some more skill, but take a breath and figure out a new style. No matter what everybody would say about "Crocodile", the acting was good. Hooper had done his job. Just after that he decided to work further with writers Adam Gierasch and Jace Anderson. The result was "Toolbox murders". I frankly haven't seen the 70's "Toolbox ...", but mostly read the last one is considered much better.The stuff is â?' Neil and Steven Burrows move into Lusman arms, a cheep place to live. Unfortunately, it's a damned place â?' from time to time a maniac killer in a black mask manages to get into the Lusman's inhabitants' flats and murder each time by one. As the plot lasts 3 or four days and the poor victims' bodies just disappear after the sadist nails or drills them, there's no one to worry for sure their dead, except a few police calls by Nell that don't do any good, but Nell feels she's simply going crazy and the weird noises and walls-beyond screaming are just in her head. The film is very interesting to watch â?' we have a lot of nicely built and directed characters, a good production design, witty and original script, nice colors and classic edition. This movie really reminds some good favorite American classic horrors. You know Hooper has an amazing talent of making almost introducing actors play really good. That's what I thought after "Croc". Here I say the same. In particular Angela Bettis worths A+. By now it's her best appearance for me. I hope they'll go on working with Tobe together. I frankly get so sad when I remember there won't be any "Brew" which Hooper was to direct. That would be nice to purchase. Like Hooper's all works â?' despite of the plot which seems so familiar, the film is shot so that it's impossible see something here you've already seen somewhere else. "Toolbox murders" - this could be the name of Hooper's genre. In horror genre he has his own. I mean he usually focuses on toolbox murders. That's the sort of thing.-Thank you, Tobe, that was great.</fullReview>

However, I really like the concept of someone building a place that steals a bit of space from this room and that to allow for quite alot of space within the building to allow someone to sneak around without anyone else having a clue.The film is average, and therefore watchable, I have only one gripe.

Sure his stuff he's done has never been able to top TCM but to be perfectly frank not many films do.Anyway, toolbox murders is a very dark and very underrated horror film. its a better version than the original and is more horror prone than the old one. Tobe directs this film inch perfect acting is solid there some extremely well suspense filled moments and many jump scenes. one thing i really liked about this film was how unpredictable it was.Hooper remade a film that needed remaking and he did it remarkably well and it was from the writers who also worked with Tobe on his overly criticised crocodile. a must see for fans of Hooper and the horror genre in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tobe Hooper's Return to Greatness?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young woman (Angela Bettis) and her husband move into an apartment complex in Hollywood, but from day one things are not going well. People disappear, screams come from every corner and there is pounding in the night. What is the secret of the Lusman Building? This could be Tobe Hooper's return to form. Starting off strong with "Texas Chain Saw Massacre" and "The Funhouse", he took a nose dive for a while. He has always had a sense of blandness mixed in with his subversive side... and this film breaks that mold. No blandness here.Adam Gierasch, the film's writer, appears as the apartment manager Byron, with great voice modification. And I think Gierasch may have been this film's savior, writing Hooper a script that is well thought out, original, esoteric, and breathes new life into the dead slasher genre.Angela Bettis is one of today's best horror actresses... is she weirdly hot or just weird? The Julia character... not sure why, but she's the sexual object for Ned, the strange handyman and murder suspect. Even Sheri Moon shows up for some reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome remake from Tobe Hooper.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At an apartment complex in Hollywood, a couple named Nell (Angela Bettis) and her husband Steven (Brent Roam) move in as they meet some friendly and not-too-friendly neighbors. It was once a place for the stars to live along time ago until weird stuff began happening with mysterious disappearances years ago. A homicidal maniac uses weapons of any kind from drill to hammer begins killing off some of the residents one by bloody one and secrets from the past are coming back.Co-starring Sherri Moon Zombie, Juliet Landau, Christopher Doyle and Adam Weisman, this is a nifty reimagining of the low budget "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" wannabe known as "The Toolbox Murders" but this one is directed by horror maestro Tobe Hooper. Hooper really admired the original as the best rip-off of his masterpiece he'd ever seen and decided to update it for a new generation. I gotta say how pleasantly surprised i was at this new version from an artist as he improved on the material very nicely. Much like the original it has it's use of buzz-saws, drills, hammering and gore galore but very done well! the acting is quite decent and the story has much improved.It's an old-school style remake that i highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not much a Tobe Hooper fan. Aside from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Salem's Lot I haven't liked any of his movies (unless you want to give him credit for Poltergeist). I therefore wasn't expecting much when I picked up his remake of The Toolbox Murders.I haven't seen the original, so I can't say how this remake compares, but on its own, this movie is a winner. A young couple moves into a rat trap old building in Hollywood. He's an intern and is gone most of the time leaving Nell Barrows with too much time on her hands. She finds out some strange things about the building's history and unbeknownst to all, somebody is murdering the tenants.Right from the beginning when the camera is filming through a sheet of plastic in the rain, it manages to give off a downright unsettling atmosphere. A fantastic job was done lighting the creepy old building, making every shadow seem threatening. Everything feels old, grimy and unpleasant. The music is surprisingly good. There is the usual 'string swell' to make you jump, but otherwise it works well to ratchet up your nerves. The whole movie is an exercise in tension.Really the only bad part about this movie is the whole 'toolbox murders' gimmick. The story really stands on its own and is good enough without the different tool for each murder shtick. If the killer just used a knife or something, that would have worked just as well. It felt like they needed to throw in the unusual murder weapons to keep the name.Still, this was a pretty good movie. I'd recommend it to fans of old fashioned '70's and '80's horror movies. They don't make many like this any more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could have been a good suspenseful movie, or a good slasher, but it seemed like they couldn't decide which way to go with it. The murder scenes are gory enough, but lack intensity, as if the victims are only putting up a mild struggle. The plot holes are enormous, the hints about magic and spells seem to lead nowhere, and the mystical part of the story could have been left out, instead of being picked up and left to wither away. A better written movie would have elaborated on the background of the killer, instead of leaving you with dozens of questions about his appearance and motivations. He seems intriguing, for the last 10 minutes of the movie...until then he's just some guy with a ski mask and a nail gun. The killing blow is the ending, which feels like they lost the last few pages of the script. The acting was surprisingly good, but the movie is dull and painful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>surpasses most of horror films produced nowadays</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tobe Hooper, a well-known director of one of the greatest horrors ever made - "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", came back to his roots and shot good, low-budget slasher. I must admit that "Toolbox Murders" has a generic plot. However, one cannot deny that the idea of somebody prowling in an old, neglected apartment without certain rooms seems scary. Unfortunately characters' behavior is illogical and improbable, which is a frequent sin of this kind of flick. I also regret that the murderer becomes so similar to his predecessors at the end. (trying to avoid spoiler here) On the other side, the film has numerous virtues which, to my mind, fully compensate derivativeness of screenplay. First of all, the story develops very well and in the course of time characters gained my sympathy. Secondly, as the plot develops awe-inspiring, gory scenes, which should satisfy every horror fan, occurs. I liked that the director plays with viewer's expectations, as horrifying scenes with the usage of various tools happen unexpectedly. What's more, Angela Bettis is outstanding as the main heroine. To conclude, this flick surpasses most of horror films produced nowadays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel a lot of horror fans expect too much from Tobe Hooper after Texas Chainsaw Massacre. As do fans of John Carpenter who always compare his work to Halloween, George Romero to Dawn Of The Dead and Wes Craven to Nightmare On Elm Street. What Tobe gives us here is a fantastic grim horror film that never lets up in pace and shocks.A masked killer who bumps off residents in an apartment block is about all this film has in common with the original. The film does have a similar feeling of decay and an ingrained, necessary violence that was present in TCM.The acting is top notch for a horror film: Angela Bettis is truly convincing as the paranoid heroine who investigates the strange goings on in the Lusman building. Rance Howard is also notable as the gentle old resident who gives Bettis' character hints along the way.All in all a highly recommended modern day horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in 1974 Tobe Hooper was the Next Big Thing for creating THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE. Then he was King of the World when he directed POLTERGEIST.This was followed by a series of disasters of Old Testament proportion's. LIFE FORCE, a quickly forgotten (but very nicely done) remake of INVADERS FROM MARS and a really bad CHAINSAW sequel.After doing lots of work for TV he hit rock bottom. If you think it hurts seeing a cool guy like Peter Jackson do big budget crap like KING KONG, it's even worse when a cool guy like Hooper does no budget crap like CROCODILE.But with THE TOOLBOX MURDERS Hooper is back at the top of his form.Like POLTERGEIST, this deals with the theme of The Bad Place. In POLTERGEIST it was a subdivision built on an Indian burial ground.THE TOOLBOX MURDERS is set in an elegant old hotel (actually the Ambassador Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard) which has seen better days and is being cut up into apartments. The hotel had been built in the Golden Age of Hollywood; it has a mysterious history that the main characters learn about to their peril.The movie's great strength comes from the collection of excellent actors that Hooper has assembled here. Angela Bettis, the leading lady, ought to be a big star. Correction, make that a huge star. Her performance is the heart and soul of the picture. She plays a would be schoolteacher who moves into the strange old building while her husband completes his medical residency. She's troubled by the strange noises she hears in the building, and the strange events that cause her to dial 911 and then find that there's no real emergency. This does nothing for her credibility with the police.She makes two good friends in the building. Rance Howard (yes, Ron's dad) plays a retired actor who may know more about the building than is good for him. Juliet Landau plays a neighbor who mysteriously vanishes. When a secondary character speaks of having lost a large amount of weight, you know the person shouldn't start reading any long novels.This causes the heroine to go into full Nancy Drew mode. She ties her hair back in a sensible ponytail and begins to explore the building, acting on mysterious clues that have been given her by the old actor. She learns that there are secret passages in the building, unaccounted space big enough to hide a whole townhouse within the walls of the apartment complex.There is violence. There is blood. But, like Hooper's CHAINSAW MASSACRE, some of the goriest footage is projected by the viewer's brain. Hooper stated that in going through old papers from CHAINSAW's production he found that they only purchased 1.5 ounces of stage blood, while the remake probably bought it in gallon tanks. Quick cutting and effective use of light and shadow let his CHAINSAW have the grossest possible gore effects almost entirely coming from the viewer's imagination. Toward the end, though, the blood and gore in THE TOOLBOX MURDERS gets more overt and that costs the film the other two stars.Watch this one twice. Once for the movie itself. Then watch it again for the director's commentary. It makes you appreciate just how good this movie is, and teaches valuable lessons on how clever artists create solid work without massive budgets.By the way, this is a "remake"- note the quotation marks- of a movie with the same name. Different setting. Different decade. Different story. Different characters. Different dynamics between them. Completely different type of villain. Other than that it's a pretty faithful remake. Not.I can't close this without a nod to the awesomely beautiful Sherri Moon. She plays Daisy Rain, a would be actress who plays what I call the Janet Leigh character: remember the very first time you saw PSYCHO and then boom the whole story dynamic shifted?I'll grant you, there are some things about the story that are hard to deal with in the context of the real world, a lot of Why didn't and Why couldn't questions about bodies and body parts that are stacked like Lincoln logs in a secret part of the building. Corpses have been accumulating since the early days of talking movies, but nobody in the area notices the smell? I can answer all those questions in one statement: Because this is a thrill ride of a movie, not a documentary on The Discovery Channel, that's why.I'm looking forward to seeing MORTURARY. There was a Canadian film by that title many, many years ago but I don't know that there's supposed to be any connection.By the way, both Hooper and Angela Bettis are from Texas, both from Austin. Being a Texan myself, I see that as a good thing.I turn sixty next month, so I figure I'll have another twenty years of movie-going left in me. I will live long enough to see Angela Bettis become a big star. I will. I will.A footnote: The outtakes are far bloodier than the movie itself, and were probably cut to ensure the R-rating as opposed to an NC-17. For my two cents worth, I'd suggest that you skip them. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shouldn't Have Been Called "Toolbox Murders", not bad though...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, if you are interested in the title and/or premise, seek out the newest version of the original Toolbox Murders, put out by Blue Underground. It is a grisly low budget 70's gore fest, in the tradition of Tobe Hooper's own Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Speaking of which, that movie was remade just before this one came out. What is ironic is that although reviled by some longtime fans of the original "Chainsaw", the remake of that film is much more true to its source material than this bizarre little thriller.Like the "Chainsaw", the original Toolbox Murders was loosely based on real events. Both of those movies have a minimalist, almost documentary cinematography and production design shot in real locations. Both movies are also profoundly disturbing. This movie makes the mistake of straying from that approach, adding supernatural elements and multiple plot twists and plenty of unnecessary characters that have nothing to do with the original. Furthermore, the lead actress is unappealing. But the score is solid and Tobe Hooper knows how to direct gore though, and this movie has just enough of that to earn it 5 stars. Fans of any of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre films will definitely enjoy the original more.Had this movie been titled something else, I wouldn't have judged it a rip off of the Toolbox Murders. Being a Tobe Hooper film, and given the somewhat obscure status of the 1978 movie, I don't think it helped much by calling this the Toolbox Murders. It really does have a completely different plot and characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's in the toolbox?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that Tobe Hooper's career has taken a nosedive. That said, his most recent effort, 2004's Toolbox Murders (not to be confused with the 1978 crap fest of the same name and similar plot) is much more than one would expect. Nell Barrows (the underrated Angela Bettis) and her husband Steven move into a historic Hollywood apartment building, full of old world charm (constant construction, odd symbols, hair and teeth hidden in the walls) and charismatic people (a hippie chick who sings late into the night, a teen who uses his computer skills to spy on women, a pathetic but suspicious handyman). Naturally, tenants begin to disappear without a trace, and Nell (already troubled by the recent death of her father) finds herself in your average "people are being murdered and no one believes me until they get killed" situation. When a trusted friend (Juliet Landau) goes missing, its up to Nell to try and save her.The acting is top notch, and there are parts that actually made me jump, something few horror movies are able to accomplish anymore. The ending is a ripoff of another, more popular film (I wont say which), but overall, I'd give Toolbox Murders 7/10. USELESS FACTS: Look for Sheri Moon Zombie as Daisy Rain, the first victim; The writers of Toolbox Murders, Jace Anderson and Adam Gierash (who played handyman Ned), were later chosen by none other than Dario Argento to write the screenplay for the long-awaited third installment in the three Mothers trilogy, the recently announced Mater Lachrymarum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tobe Hooper is a craftsman and a true pioneer and this proves it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Toolbox Murders", while being interpreted as a "remake" of an earlier film with the same name, is given a powerful upgrade and the story shines thanks to the duties of fright master Tobe Hooper. There is something "wrong" with the overrated and creepy looking "Lusman Arms" apartment complex. For years, this old place has been catering to the best Hollywood has to offer, but now, it seems that the "Arms" has been caught up in controversy as well as strange hammering sounds heard in the night. For many who live here, it will not be a heavenly voyage to the stars and screens. The guests who live here are a beautiful struggling actress, an actor going into his most recent audition, a former overweight woman, a dysfunctional family and their brainy son, and a newly married young couple. Our married youngsters have had stormy money problems and have moved into the decrepit housing project. While the husband is out "on call" usually at his place of business, the hospital, his wife Nell(played well by Angela Bettis) is left at home, usually scared by the continuous "knocking" noises and drilling. As she is finding clues to find out what is going on, her neighbors are systematically slaughtered, drilled, and hammered by a masked man who somehow lives in the bowels of the building. Here is where we find Hooper at his best. We go through caverns and unknown tunnels, not knowing what we will reach. He has approached this "exploring the unknown" in several films including "The Funhouse", "Poltergeist", and of course, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Toolbox" really brings us back to the classic form of screen terror we have longed for since we traveled to "Salem's Lot", which was also masterfully done by Hooper. If you thought Tobe Hooper was done with you, think again and give this "power driller killer" a spin. There's always a vacancy at The Lusman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is the check out policy at this Hollywood hotel?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Tobe Hooper gives us grizzly delight. Newlyweds Nell(Angela Bettis)and Steven(Brent Roam)move into the rundown historic Lusman Arms hotel in Hollywood. When renovations get started, so does a string of horrid murders. Tenants seem to meet their deaths by way of misuse of toolbox tools. Odd hammers and saws help sustain a supernatural curse that is carried out by a disfigured soul that excels in dealing out torture. Bolt cutters, screw drivers, vise grips, hammers and mallets are all implements of depraved death.My favorite scene is when the hippie chick is nailed to the wall with a nail-gun. There is also the task that seems a routine chore of removing a guy's head right below the eyes. Then there is the discovery of previous victims decaying. Grissly, gruesome and gory is the evil that lurks in this dilapidated tinsel town hotel. Its a lot easier to check in than check out. Also in the cast: Juliet Landau, Rance Howard, Marco Rodriguez and Sheri Moon.</fullReview>

How did he know about the killer? Why was he allowed to live?2.) The killer- okay so he "clawed his way" out of his mother's body. Then what? He was in a fire? He drank Ponce de Leon's fountain of youth juice? Whats with the face and the homicidal tendencies?3.) Why was Ned and Byron allowed to live so long? 4.) Did Saffron eventually die, nailed to the ceiling? Or was she finished off later on? 5.) If there was no apartment 4 on any floor, why did they make their attempts to "hide" that so obvious? Why not just make the former #5 apartments #4's? 6.) Why doesn't Angela Bettis eat? I just wish we had more of an understanding of the killer, instead of some quickly thrown in nonsense about a "pagan" spell (and once again spreading the negative stereotype of the pentagram). And what did the symbols have to do with anything? It seemed that she was following a map, but it looked to me like she was just finding the symbols and looking at them.</fullReview>

I didn't expect the toolbox murders to be good, but I didn't think is would be this bad 1 out of 10 and that's being generous. The acting was awful too. Tobe Hooper hasn't made a decent movie for years. If anyone caught the episodes of Freddy's Nightmares that Tobe directed they were better than this so don't expect much if you haven't seen it. There is no real horror in this movie, it relies on using the same technique Alan Silvestri uses in "what lies beneath" in order to scare the audience by which I mean punching a silent moment with a loud noise to make them jump. Complete rubbish. We need more psychological horror.</fullReview>

There is not a single good original sequence in this film!.There are some good ones,but we've sen them at least hundred times!The plot is also generic and easily predictable,without any touch of creativity and originality.The violence is overblown and it dominates the film,but the scenes of slaughter are not scary-not at all.And they don't look realistic!For example,the scene of beheading.You can easily see a man beheading A DOLL,not another man.Where are the effects?And I am not pretending to be Sharlock or Hercule Poirot here,but I realized how the film would end after 20 minutes of watching it.Take five horror films from the third millennium,put them in a grinder and polish the resulting mess until it starts resembling a movie and you'll have the prescription from almost everything on here.

		<shortDescription>Hooper is Master of Crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Toolbox Murders is a complete waste of time. Tobe Hooper is attached to the "Masters of Horror" project and some people actually think he's a good director, well, he's finally driven the final nail into his own coffin with this tremendous turd. Texas Chainsaw Massacre, his one and only film worth watching (I'll allow Poltergeist, but he had a lot of help) is widely regarded as scary because of its amateur directing giving it a documentary style. Its minimalism is its charm. Well we're 30 years on and Hooper has learned nothing of the craft of directing. The performances are lackluster (the lead is horrible being able to act freaked out and nothing else), the story is crap, the dialogue blows, the shot selection is lame, nearly everything that happens is implausible, and the lighting is atrocious. OK yes, the dark is scary, but thats when you're in the dark. In a movie the dark is annoying because we don't know whats going on. Pass that memo to Hooper.Further, Hooper goes through great lengths to set up tons of clichés and then purposefully avoids them. Tons of times you'll see the cliché coming and then he wont deliver, and its not clever, its repetitive and annoying. This film is still predictable though, despite Hooper's very visible attempt to try and make it unique. Simply put, its garbage from start to finish. This is not a slasher film, either. Don't listen to anyone who tries to tell you that its awesome or has great inventive kills or a high body count. The kills are lame and poorly shot and very poorly lit. One guy seriously dies for like no reason. The total body count is around 7, most of which happen quickly near the end. And why does the killer use tools? There is absolutely no explanation for this. As for the killer himself, they feed us some garbage about his birth and the cult, all of which is stupid. But the kills really bothered me because using power tools and stuff should be super messy and gory and hardcore. Nope. The first kill and one of the last are OK in that respect, but most just suck. Oh and for some reason at the end the killer switches from killing to accomplish a goal (a stupid, stupid part of the stupid stupid story) and its pretty much business like, then at the end he giggles when he kills someone. Total crap.The one positive is the score, which manages to help the film create tension at some points. There are a few jump scares and the film does a relatively decent job of keeping up tension, but it doesn't help at all. Its crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>S10 Reviews: Toolbox Murders (2003)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Angela Bettis stars in Tobe Hooper's remake of the 1978 original. This time around Bettis and her screen hubby move into an old and storied Hollywood hotel. Strange characters populate the place (red herrings galore) as the Barrows settle in to their new surroundings. The usual strange things begin to happen and as the body count mounts Bettis must find out the secret of the building and unmask the killer. I was figuring on a pretty standard slasher flick when I sat down to view this one, given Hooper's track record of late and such. But I was more than pleasantly surprised that Toolbox Murders wound up to be one of the better new releases I had seen in a while. The excellent photography gave a great ambiance to the film and captured the overall strangeness of the dilapidated building. Hooper seems to have been reinvigorated on "Toolbox" and I for one am glad. The remake has several good gore scenes and is quite a bit better than the original. The cute Bettis is well on her way to becoming the next scream queen; I must say a very welcome sight too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film at a midnight showing on the Stockholm International Film Festival of 2004. It's become a tradition for me to at least see one or two midnight horror movies at the festival every year. What has unfortunately also become almost a tradition are the constant disappointments with these horror movies.Toolbox Murders is a pretty standard-fare slasher flick. A couple has recently moved into a strange old building where renovations are being made. Strange things happen and someone is running around murdering people with different kinds of tools (hammers, drills etc.). The woman in this couple starts investigating the strange happenings and discovers that the building is special.After seeing only fifteen minutes of this film i already thought "My god, is stuff like this still being made?!". I felt like i was transported back to the 1970's when slasher flicks like this were top fare and every movie looked like this with campy acting and cheap effects. Basically all of the actors are over-acting, and most of the characters are about as deep as cardboard-cutouts. This is not necessarily a problem in a slasher flick, but there are so few forgiving elements here that it does indeed become a problem. Also, constantly the characters act completely without logic, like turning away from the killer to speak to his last victim, while he is still in fact charging at them to kill them too!The gore effects are somewhat disgusting, and made in a way that more makes you laugh than anything else. The story feels wasted and it feels like the director didn't really know what kind of movie he wanted to make. It starts out like a b-movie from the 70's, then almost turns into a Ghostbusters-ripoff before it turns into a complete mess in the end... Clichés can often work to your advantage, especially in the horror genre, but someone should tell directors of today that you don't have to use EVERY cliché there is.I'm afraid that not even Tobe Hoopers alleged "cult" status can save this train-wreck. This is not funny, not scary and simply not entertaining. I rate it 3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like gory, cheesy slasher flicks as much as anybody, and it actually amazes me how bad this one was. I'm not sure if this re-make was supposed to be funny or scary, but it was neither. The acting was abysmal. I've seen home movies better than this.So we start with all these girls who live in this one apartment building getting killed. But no one notices/believes anything has happened to them... because they are unmarried, I guess? Fortunately, a married woman moves into the building and risks her life to find a missing neighbor with whom she had a ten-minute conversation. Naturally, her husband (a young doctor who apparently got stuck with the dreaded 24-hour on-call shift) comes home for the first time since they moved into the apartment just in time to save her from the killer. Oh, and the other hero is a teenager who sits in front of his computer all day leering at one of the girls through a web cam she doesn't know about that is pointed at her bed. Classy.There's some kind of deeper story about the apartment building and how the killer is attached to building and blah blah blah, but I lost track of it half-way through when it got so boring I zoned out for a few minutes.I especially loved the character that you are supposed to think is the killer--a great cameo by the caveman from those insurance commercials. Oh, and the obligatory cute old man who almost saves the day and dies.Mr. Hooper, I'd like my 90 minutes back.</fullReview>

The way the murders are committed is stupid and we don't even get to see anything. What's worse than the effects is the story in itself. 2 People move into a new apartment (whoop-dee-do) and some people get killed. The only problem is that we don't get to know the people other than their names which doesn't make me care that they get killed. Same goes for the main characters, I only know what their name is so I don't give a crap about how viciously they are killed...The "bad guy" is a total Silence of the Lambs/Ed Gein rip-off and once again we don't get to know anything about him either.

		<fullReview>Someone needs to tell Tobe Hooper to retire. It started with that Spontaneous Combustion movie. Then it went to Night Terrors. Then he went to "drama' with Apartment Complex. Then he tried to re-make Eaten Alive with Crocodile and now he remakes Toolbox Murders. Toolbox murders is a step up from these films but that's like saying, "Well that mentally retarded child just peed in my mouth when he was originally going to poop in it." Toolbox is terrible. After a promising opening of a woman being terrorized in her apartment by a killer and having her head bashed in with a hammer, we have a young couple (is it me or does every horror movie now have actors under the age of 45?) who move into this crummy apartment with lots of funny and quirky characters. (aka: annoying and not funny) The killer once in awhile springs up to kill a few people (one he kills thru an elevator which we never see. Guess he forgot his toolbox for that one) The killer even has acid in his toolbox! Who caries that? I know Adam Suess carries huge sub sandwiches in his but not acid. The history behind the killer almost makes zero sense and when there isn't a killing, the movie stops dead and is more boring than watching man glaze dry. There is no suspense, the gore is edited (its added as "deleted scenes" on the DVD with a stupid time code running thru the whole scene) no boobs or broccoli bush, bad acting, and the ending is a complete rip-off of Halloween. The movie is better than Drowning in the Haze however. Rent the original Toolbox Murders otherwise stick a screwdriver up your butt.</fullReview>

This, takes the cake, eats it, shits it out and then tries to feed it to you, the one watching. All the while being real proud over itself for its run-down building atmosphere. Sure, it had one moment where it even made me slightly interested in how this storm of plot-holes and bad writing would need. Problem is, just as they really try to do something good with this piece of garbage, the writer makes it commit suicide, making you angry you even got your hopes up.Im gonna say this one more time, STAY ...

		<fullReview>Although I write in this commentary solely about the building in which the horrible crimes are happening, notice that this is already a spoiler - if not THE spoiler of the whole movie. This is why I "flagged" this text.It is not by change that the candidates for "haunted houses" are exclusively old buildings. "This house is history, and you are a part of it", the maintenance supervisor says in Tobe Hooper's "Toolbox Murders" (2003). Practically only old houses possess these creaky beams, that stale odor that comes out of the walls, the characteristic noise when the wind presses against the windows, the howling of an old elevator, etc. But that is not all. Before the unfortunate functionalism started to make Tabula Rasa with each trace of architectural generosity, houses often had strange hollow parts in the walls, little closets that lead wide into nowhere, "crawling spaces" between ceiling and next higher floor, mysterious huge and sometimes more-level attics and cellars, etc. And so it is in "Toolbox Murders": "There is a whole townhouse in this building", the historian in the movie says. It turns out that from each apartment there is a little space lacking, but so that these parts are connected by a steep stairwell in the wall of the house. (Note: The building is not the Ambassador Hotel, as indicated in IMDb. The Ambassador Hotel was torn down two years before the movie was shot.)</fullReview>

Unfortunately, I thought it was a pretty dull film and quite predictable. I didn't feel the actors were particularly good either. It might appeal to people who like slasher films and like to see characters being hacked about and fake blood splattered around but for anyone expecting to see something a bit more sophisticated and less gory then I doubt this movie would appeal. The movie definitely had a feel of having been made on a low budget, which isn't always a bad thing and can sometimes be quite refreshing but in this instance it didn't really work for me and it just seemed tacky. I would only recommend this film if someone had nothing better to do with their time than to watch a cheesy horror film, but personally I could think of many better ways to spend my time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It pains me to call a Tobe Hooper film run of the mill.But it is.Hooper made the great "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" in the early 70's but has continued to flounder since then.Except for the mainstream hit "Poltergeist",which wasn't all that good,and "TCM2" which was good but generated no box-office interest,Hooper seems to have lost his way in making horror films since "TCM".Prehaps he lucked out with that one? Anyway here he is ,the man who inspired more horror movies to be made than any other director, except maybe for Hitchcock,doing a remake of someone else's horror film.In this movie some bandaged up freak, who lives in some secret rooms in an apartment building ,starts killing folks in gruesome ways using mostly tools,hence the title.It is pretty gory and the story is good enough but, maybe its me, I just expect more than stuff like this from Hooper.Prehaps we horror fans have elevated Hooper up to a level that even he can't reach any more no matter how good his films are? Do we expect too much from him? Prehaps.But still his films since "TCM" haven't just been not as scary they have been,for the most part, just downright bad.Get back on track Mr.Hooper and scare the hell out of us again.The fact that the great Tobe Hooper is now doing lukewarm remakes is much scarier to me than this film could ever be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasant trip back to old-school horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tobe Hooper is well known for his hit cult Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Whereas I did enjoy this film, I didn't think it was as good as people said it was. Everyone stated it was excessively gory and violent, however when I watched it I didn't think it was too bad. When I read reviews of this film...everyone stated how they didn't like it. Over the top violence, poor plot and lack of depth is what the critics said. When my friend brought it over I watched it and found it a pleasant surprise. It opens up with a good, solid, brutal and violent murder. What follows is a series of other deaths of tenants in an block of apartments, and one woman trying to see out what's happening. The murders are very original, and gory but I think could have been better if the director had a bigger budget = making the death scenes even worst and bumping the rating to an 18 (UK). The only thing I have against this film is that the killer isn't properly explained. He's said to have been fighting out of his dead mother and therefore being born as a part of death. This could have been explained a bit more, and the reason why he is disfigured is never explained either. The ending is a bit more to be desired as well. The police arrive, and the body is missing. Next thin you know he' jumping through a window (on the third floor) to attack the victim again, and ends up being hung outside. Again when the police arrive the body is gone..... What would have been better is if he would have won, and killed the victim in the way he tried to (sawing her in half) - but that's just my sick opinion.Overall this film is impressive with good scares, gory deaths and a suspenseful and indulging plot. Much better than I expected and a well deserved 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tobe Hooper's Return to his old style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ToolBox Murders is often compared, and often called a "remake" of the 70's "The Toolbox Murders" it is actually not, it takes on a life of it's own Deep in the shadows an evil being "born of death" lurks in the shadows and structure of an old run-down apartment building that has recently reopened, which has awakened this enigma's rage. As people move in, so does the killer slowly, and quietly killing them one by one.The cast is great and Angela Bettis as Nell, offers a great performance, i'd say one of the best in her career so far. When you need the strong husband that guards the hesitated and timid wife, you get Shawn whom is played by Brent Roam who does a great job as the guardian, safe-keep of his wife. This movie also has a kooky supporting cast that is also well played out one that stands out in remembrance is the character of the weird and shy repairman, his look is that of a grungy, careless non responsible individual and often leads you to believe that HE could be the man behind the mask....is he? Also it was really great to see Rance Howard (father of Ron and Clint Howard) in this film, he's such a great talent.This movie is definitely a must see on my list of lists, so please take my advice and rent/Buy this film as it is highly well executed and shot, by Hooper.Some of the gore is so brilliant and innovative, some that other movies have tried....but it never looked this good! The gore alone is what makes this such a film....Finally Tobe Hooper brings to life another enigmatic, mysterious being, just as he did in 1974 with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Gunnar Hansen as LEATHERFACE.- Rick Blalock</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely terrifying, and lots of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Toolbox Murders" is the scariest American film since "The Ring." Hooper manages the neat trick of paying homage to the slasher tradition that he himself launched so long ago with "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" while also adding some dimension and wit to the proceedings by virtue of a nicely detailed Hollywood urban legend angle. The atmosphere is positively claustrophobic and palpably creeeeeeeeepy, and the terror -- which starts early and brutally -- is unrelenting. The tech aspects of the film, from the lushly dark camera-work to Joseph Conlan's inventive and eclectic score, prove that cheaper can be as good as, if not better than, a big budget extravaganza. Performances are uniformly solid, especially Angela Bettis in the classic scream queen role and Juliet Landau, finally getting some post-"Buffy" work. Great scary stuff!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>too many women being killed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is quite violent toward women, most of the victims are women killed in very sadistic attacks. I quite like horror movies as a a genre so long as they have an element of intelligence in the script and they are not too misogynistic. It had a saving grace in allowing the female lead to use her intelligence to work out what was going on ( finding out where the killer was) and stop being a victim, though when she went in to shock when her boyfriend turned up she became a little annoying ( it was understandable she would be upset but i find screaming hard on my nerves). The characters weren't really given any depth and i struggled to care whether they lived or died and the killer was just 'yer average' scarred lunatic. I'm not a huge fan of gore and i don't like seeing bits flying off people and violence against women turns my stomach normally in films. They should have shown the women being more competent and less vulnerable, women in action films dominate the box office these days so it seems old fashioned to not 'doff the hat' to this. In summation it was relatively tense with too much sadistic violence, not enough character development or humour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than crappy is still bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though this movie is much better than Hooper's more recent "Mortuary," better than crappy is still bad. While "Mortuary" is beyond any hope of redemption, "Toolbox Murders" I thought actually started with promise. Had I known it was a Hooper film, I probably would have changed the channel right there. Once things get rolling in the movie, the same problem that made "Mortuary" so spectacularly bad plague "Toolbox Murders" as well. The plot lines of both movies are rambling and lack coherence. And they leave a lot of unanswered questions, and not in a way that makes you think, "Wow, what interesting food for thought," but rather, "What the f- was that all about?" The characters are better developed in "Toolbox Murders" compared to "Mortuary," and I thought the acting, on the whole, was good. Tobe just needs to find some better writers. Writers that can weave a tight plot rather than a random mish-mash of story lines, none of which get satisfactorily developed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's OK...if you prefer the obvious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This picture has none of the elements that make a good horror film. It doesn't have atmosphere, suspense, dark humor, or even some kind of half credible explanation for why all this is happening in the first place. It does have its moments though. Lots of chasing and running around through the hidden maze of secret passages and not knowing what's going to jump out at you or from where. But that's limiting in effect after a certain amount of time. I found myself becoming less surprised actually as the film wore on. It's sort of cartoonish in its approach. This is the thing that modern late 20th Century directors and writers have come up with in order to keep the interest of the audience. The story, if there is one, has to be kept up at a break neck speed and without any type of character dimension or development. Maybe they do this because that's what audiences today have to expect and want. Alfred Hitchcock always said that it's the thing that you think, imagine, is behind the door that really scares you. Not one butchery after another as is the case here. "Toolbox" is an apt name for this schlock because it's approached in a workman like manner and the art is not there. Despite my groaning, it's still a fairly good time waster, if what you're after is wasting time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has moments of terror that redeem it nicely for horror fans. The nail-gun victim still alive and moving her eyes, that got my attention. I was curious as to how Nell was able to bring the blueprints back to her apartment, but it just shows how focused and resourceful she was getting to be. No wonder she was able to marry a doctor! The sheer number of rotting and mummified victims was impressive. The smell would have carried all the way to Texas! These days, it's hard to imagine that no one ever noticed the rocking chair on the roof, during all the years of that building's existence. I had trouble also with the Coffin Baby story. When the coroner checked for a fetal heartbeat, he was probably drowned out by some kind of Spell. Ditto for the embalmer at the funeral home. This would explain why the kid was such a survivor, and I was secretly hoping to see him again during the final credits.How did that kid manage to burn a back-up of the computer camera, since he was busted in the act by his mother before he saw the thrilling (drilling) finalé to her demise? This movie doesn't hold up to the Great Ones, but it finished strong and it had both memorable characters and classic scenes.</fullReview>

This movie delivered its moments of scares, horror, suspense, and enough Gore to please the eye for all the horror fans! STOP MAJOR SPOILERS SO DO NOT READ ON IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW HOW PEOPLE GET KILLED IN THE MOVIE You will see various killings such as Cutting off heads, Drills going into people, Snapping of Spinal Cords, Acid eating away a face, and nailing a girl to the wall all with enough gore to say OK well this movie fits into the category of Horror. Tobe hooper created such a great movie I couldn't believe it. It started out slow but then it really started to roll. The music in the movie was what really kept you in it because it wasn't some cheesy music that should have been played at a circus. This movie is right up there with House of Wax or Wrong Turn because it delivers its shock effect! I jumped many times and actually even went "oh man thats gross but really awesome!" It was just a good movie that was found on the shelves beside all the big box office hits. It was such a good scare that I would even go as far as it basically tore a hole through all the so called horror movies like The amityville, The Ring 2, and White noise. Those movies had a big reputation before it hit the movies but it fizzled out with its content that it provided the viewers with. This is like the movie you see on the shelf and think hmm now why didn't they put this in the movie theaters instead of the Ring 2?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Toolbox Murders</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Toolbox Murders, is a remake of the 1978 film of the same name. The film is set in California where a husband and wife named Steven and Nell Barrows, moves into an odd apartment. Steven works during the day and Nell is at home and she soon starts to hear screams and noises coming from the walls and soon people in the apartment go missing so Nell, does some investigating to find a secret about the apartment and to find out what is going on. I have never seen the original Toolbox Murders, and for the most part I'am against remakes but I generally saw this film because of the film's director Tobe Hooper (who gave as such horror classics as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Poltergeist) and the film's star Angela Bettis (who I thought gave the best performance of the year in 2003 with the film May). I'am disappointed to say that I did not like The Toolbox Murders. Angela Bettis, did a good job but everything else was kind of dull. The story was pretty basic and there really was not a lot to it and soon it just felt like something I have seen before and nothing really new. The film also doesn't have that much suspense which is a surprise coming from Tobe Hooper, but I just could not find the suspense in this film. The film is not badly made and it is not a terrible film but it is not a great one either and it isn't really that memorable at all. In fact I'm starting to forget most of the film as I write this review. A disappoint from Tobe Hooper, who I hope directs something else again soon.</fullReview>

I hope this film gets distribution in the US because it's ten times better than the horror crap that US film companies are shoving down our throats. Don't take the 4.1 rating at face value. Look at the breakdown of the votes and you'll notice that most people voting gave it a 5 or better. Only a handful of people rated it low, which is why I can't understand the rating.

		<fullReview>Tobe Hooper's little seen remake of genre "classic" THE TOOLBOX MURDERS is a wicked little exercise in fear, terror and all-out horror. This creepy tale centers around an old-Hollywood style apartment building where tenants move in, but never seem to move out. Angela Bettis (tv's "Carrie") give a solid performance as a new resident who suspects something more sinister than her neighbour's scene-readings are taking place when she beings hearing noises, hammering and screaming emanating from within the walls of the building itself. No pulled punches and not a speck of self-referential wit here, just classic stalker/slasher mayhem, presented by Hooper in a style that skillfully evokes the low-budget, grainy realism of such earlier fright flicks as his own '74 classic, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre and totally enjoyed the whole atmosphere that Tobe managed to achieve. I also watched the 2004 (non Hooper) remake and enjoyed that version too although I did find the polish made it a little bland. I therefore looked forward to taking home Toolbox Murders hoping for a repetition of that original experience felt when watching Chainsaw Massacre. The first major shock was that Tope Hooper doesn't seem to have moved out of the 1970's with this film, I honestly felt like I was watching a seriously dated slasher flick, the acting was wooden, the inbred/mutant/murderer was pathetic and the atmosphere just seemed to lack depth and claustrophobia Tobe Hooper managed to achieve so well in Chainsaw Massacre. I would realistically recommend that you do NOT rent this movie and if it is playing free to view late at night on your TV, have an early one!</fullReview>

I liked a lot of things about this movie! However, these are outweighed by a bunch of negatives.Oddball characters living in a once ritzy LA apartment are getting killed off one by one by an unseen, unnamed killer. Too much is left unexplained about the killer. What is his connection to the supposed supernatural history of the building? How did he come to live in the hidden apartments? What happened to his face? Does he have a connection with the old man? Why am I even analysing this? It's a slasher movie, for Christ's sake! I enjoyed the great killings but not much else. I sensed a vague supernatural concept emerging but this was left unexplored. All in all, too many holes in the plot and underdeveloped storytelling for my liking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst horror remake since The Thomas Crown Affair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the worst remake of a horror film since The Thomas Crown Affair (Steve McQueen is freaking scary).In the original, there's an apartment building with like six hundred tenants, and we get to see the killer go around killing every one in six hundred new and exciting ways using six hundred different tools, all the time raping all his victims so we get to see boobs flopping around as well as getting cut of. Then with about ten minutes left in the film, the writers must have realized they need some kind of plot that's more than killing and raping to hold it all together, so the only tenant who isn't already dead (because she was at the supermarket while this all happened) is kidnapped by the killer, who takes her into his basement and prepares to kill her. He never gets around to it, though, because he kidnaps the girl from the fourth floor and the lifts are broken, so he has to use the stairs to get to the basement, but he's walks slow because he's carrying the girl so he's unbalanced, and he doesn't want to fall and hurt here (he's a nice guy). So on the way down, which takes about an hour, the killer and the girl are talking and it turns out they have a lot in common and eventually they fall in love and go to a Steve Miller concert.That film was great. But the remake has all the good stuff taken out, and it's replaced with a story of a lesbian who moves into the building and falls in love with another girl there, so she pays the other girl's neighbour to film her in the shower, which sounds like a great scene, but it's not really because she's ugly. Apparently she also used to be fat, and that's mentioned about a million times in the movie even though it has nothing to do with anything. Anyway, why the girl is in the shower, some guy in a ski mask kills her, but he doesn't rape her because she's ugly. The lesbian girl sees the tape, gets scared, runs away and that's the end of the film. It's three minutes.Somehow in all that crap, it's explained that the killer was born of a dead lady, AT HER FUNERAL. Apparently they don't even check to see if dead pregnant ladies' kids are alright these days. To make matters worse, they go and give him the name "Coffin Baby", or it could be just a title, I don't know. All I know is it's stupider than the idea that the building is run by a Mario Mario look alike.Oh, and there's a guy named Ned working at the building fixing everything that the tenants carelessly wreck. Even though he's friendly to them and he fixes their showers and doors and doesn't steal their underwear, everyone in the building hates Ned because he has bad posture and long hair. Even when everyone was telling the ugly girl that she used to be a really fat ugly bitch but now that she's not such a fatty she's alright looking, Ned tells her that she's hot at any size and ugly girl was like "shut up Ned no one likes you". The ugly girl was always crying because she couldn't get laid when she had the perfect guy right there in Ned. There was only one twenty second scene with Ned and ugly girl and another one that was like one second, but if they had expanded on that and made Ned and ugly girl the main characters and their eventually coming together a subplot, the film would have been great. If I was in that building I'd become friends with Ned and team up with him to kill the killer. Then I'd make it my mission to turn him gay and there could be a sequel about that. Then after he's gone gay, ugly girl will realize she liked Ned all this time (girls always like gay guys) and part three of the trilogy will be about her getting him back.There's also a guy named Luis, which is pronounced like Louise, which is a girls name. Why does he have a girl's name? He also can't decide if he's French of Mexican, because his accent and facial hair could go either way. Ron Howard's dad is in there somewhere too. I think he's like a million years old now. There's also a character with the last name Cunningham, which is the last name of Ron Howard's character on Happy Days. That's scarier than this film (except maybe the ugly girl shower scene).</fullReview>

Nell's character was the only one that stood out at all for me. She deserves bigger things.After his first horror gems in the 70s, Tobe Hooper has been churning these bog standard movies. This is a standard slasher movie with a decent killer. Watch this if you want to pass some time.I watched this while working at my video store.I think they went a bit far with all the supernatural elements.

		<fullReview>In a old apartment building in Los Angeles, The Lusman Arms Apartment Block. A mysterious figure is being killing the tenants. An young teacher (Angela Bettis) and her husband (Brent Roam) just moved to that building. When the young teacher discover strange symbols each floor of the building, while the place is being renovations for the moment. The woman discover, there is a man living inside the walls in the building looking for his next prey.Directed by Tobe Hooper (Eaten Alive, The Funhouse, Invaders from Mars-1986) made a good looking horror film with a good performance by Bettis. Hooper done some of his best work in years, the film is high on style and short on sense (Especially the Third Act). The film only had a limited release and played well at the film festivals. Hopefully, Hooper is coming back as the stylish horror filmmaker he was. Since he had a second career on television.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an running commentary track by the director and the screenwriters. DVD also has the original theatrical trailer, deleted scenes, trailer gallery and a hidden feature. This film is a remake of a 1978 horror film. This is the second remake Hooper is involved in. The film is better than some of his movies, especially the extremely flawed ones. If you love horror films with guts, you will love this. Written by Jace Anderson (Crocodile) and Adam Gierasch (Mortuary). Gierasch appears in a supporting role as Ned. Sheri Moon (House of 1000 Corpses, The Devil's Rejects) appears as the Victim in the opening scene. (*** ?/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great slasher flick with a twist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no idea what to expect from this movie, so I was very interested to view it. Once it began, it was easy to see the premise and then I decided to have it become a guessing game to see who was behind all of the action. This review will contain some spoilers, so please don't read on unless you've seen it.The movie opens up with a very grizzly murder and just goes from there. It begins as a normal slasher flick... innocent people dying for no apparent reason and everyone seems confused as to what's happening and how to make it stop. Throughout the beginning, I was guessing to myself who was responsible for the murders, up until my choice got his head taken off by a power saw. At that point, I decided that I wasn't going to make anymore guesses. The movie is very well done, the action scenes are well-shot and very gruesome. The use of music is very good to heighten the mood. All-in-all, it was visually a very well done movie.Once you finally get to the ending and see what's responsible for all the killings, you realize that it's like no movie you've ever seen before and that's what makes it great. In this movie age, it's always good to see something new and fresh. I recommend this one highly... watch it with the lights out. It gets really creepy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie, it was not at all like the original "Toolbox Murders" made in 1978 staring Cameron Mitchell in which I liked better than this one but I was also relieved that it was not like the original but I do think that the title and original theme of a maniacal killer that goes around from apartment to apartment killing it's tenants was taken from the original. I liked the creepy looking goth type janitor; he was the only reason I kept watching the movie. The ending of the movie in which we figure out who the killer actually was was a big disappointment. Common....a baby being born to a dead mother? Nice twist but I was like "what?" When I did find out who the killer was. It had it's times with suspense and the usual goriness that Tobe Hooper has in most of his movies. It was a good movie to watch but I wouldn't own it or call it one of my favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Toolbox Murders a great popcorn movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am an avid watcher of Tobe Hooper's work. He is an absolute horror genius. Although I enjoyed Toolbox Murders, I thought it lacked in the story department. The direction was wonderful, as expected from Tobe Hooper. The film had the same look and feel of his classic horror Funhouse, which is one of my personal favorites. Toolbox Murders is a fun campy 70's style horror movie that enjoyable as long as you see it for what it is. Don't expect it to be in-depth or have academy award winning acting, it's a horror movie. The story had lots of holes in it, but overall entertaining. Angela Bettis was a joy to watch on screen, as usual. Her presence fills this movie with a fresh new feel and of course we can't forget Sherri Moon's appearance in the movie. For those of you who don't know who Moon is, she played Baby in HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES. She is also the wife of Rob Zombie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad...not great. But good to see a Tobe Hooper film that doesn't suck!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fun little movie...yeah it has some plot holes in the forms of things that are never fully explained, but overall, it's one of the more decent slashers I've seen in a long while. It's also good to see Hooper back from what, a 25 year drought of crappy movies? Toolbox has a lot of quirky characters...none of which are truly engaging and thus, none of which you will care for, but characters that I bet truly reflect what you'd find in a low rent Hollywood rat hole like the Lusman Arms. Still, it brings plenty of lambs to the slaughter, with an excellent electric drill and wire cutter deaths, among several others.I won't spoil it for you, but it's pretty confusing towards the end as it delves into the occult, and kinda explains the motivations of the killer, but never explains what the killer is. That's all I'll say, but all in all, the twist at the end, despite a bit confusing, is pretty cool if you think about it.Just some more depth in the characters would have been appreciated. Overall, a solid horror flick.8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, Different Take On the 1978 Video Nasty.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say this is Hooper's best work since "Poltergeist", most of his stuff after that didn't impress me too much. "Toolbox Murders" is a remake of the 1978 exploitation horror film, which follows Nell and Steven Barrows, a young couple who have moved to Los Angeles, California. The couple move into the old Lusman Arms, which is a former Hollywood hotel, a playground for the rich and famous, which is now just a run down apartment building. With Steven working all day, Nell is left at home, and begins to get caught in a web of mystery behind the building's past and the strange symbols throughout it, while a series of murders begins. One thing that was unique about this film was that Hooper took the original '78 slasher and re-imagined it, adding a supernatural twist to the whole premise. The killer isn't human at all (like in the original), but is rather a strange half human-type being that hides in the walls of the building. Angela Bettis' performance was wonderful. I saw her in "May", another good horror movie, and I love her films. I think she's way underrated for her performances - I thought she was great! The opening scene with Sheri Moon's (from "House of 1000 Corspes") was great and her death was oddly reminiscent of Dario Argento's "Suspiria", for me anyway. Don't ask why, I'm not even really sure.Full of elements of the great '70s slashers, "Toolbox Murders" turns out to be an enjoyable little film. All in all, Toolbox is nothing more than it promises to be - a fun little slasher movie. Chocked full of gore and some decent scares, "Toolbox Murders" is an overall good movie. I liked it, at least. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tobe Hooper returns to his Texas Chainsaw roots with a remake of a film that ripped off his classic Massacre movie. This film is a definite improvement over the 1978 film (that film sucks). A young couple moves into an old apartment building, and then the "fun" starts. Someone is murdering people using various tools. This is not the usual slasher movie, but it is very violent and very scary. Its nice to see someone taking a movie that ripped off their original and making a great film out of it. Don't watch this one with the lights off, and don't watch it alone. The lead actress was the star of the film, "May." Released on DVD by Lions Gate Entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** Extremely violent and graphically bloody and brutal slasher movie that never really gets to the reason why all this carnage is happening on the screen. We get informed about the Lusman Arms apartment building from it's long time resident actor Chas Rocker, Rance Howard, and from the Los Angeles Preservation Society about it being used by this Masonic-like cult, Talman Lunar, in it's practice of Black Magic rites. Being built in the early 1920's most of the construction workers ended up either dead or insane for their efforts and for the next eighty years or so scores of resident ended up missing and never to be seen again. "Toolbox Murders" starts off like your average slasher film with both Lusman Arms tenants Daisy and Saffnon, Sheri Moon &amp; Sara Downing, ending up with their head bashed in with a claw hammer and pinned to the ceiling with a nail-gun by the hooded killer. Later Physcical fitness nut Julia, Juliet Landau, also gets it from the killer as he drilled her to death with his power drill but there's nothing at all to indicate what this cult, The Masonic Talman Lunar Cult, had to do with these murders. Nell,Angela Bettis, who was a good friend of Julia felt that something terrible happened to her next-door neighbor and after getting no help from the building super Byron, Greg Travis,and the local police, Nell had cried wolf too many times for her to be believed. Nell goes to the Los Angeles Presevation Scociaty and finds out the secret of the Lusman Arms but it had nothing to do with the killing so why even be told about it? The killer himself, who should have been at least eighty years old to have committing the killing at the apartment building since the 1920's, who at first seemed to be totally unconnected with the story about the Lasman Arms but later, when he's about to slash Nell to death, backs up in a state of sheer fright. Thats when he sees the Masonic symbols that she, it's never really explained why since Nell could have just wrote them down on a pad of paper, wrote on her arms. The killer then ends up falling down from her apartment window hanging with an electric cord tied around his neck. Uneven horror film that just never makes it's point but does have more then it's share of blood and gore with a number of truly shocking and effective jolts. Were also told, by Chas Rocker, that the hooded killer was born in a coffin with his mother dead and about be buried. Which, like everything else in the film, had nothing at all to do with the so-called curse of the Lasman Arms Building.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Toolbox murders, I think the name says it all, I watched this film last week and laughed from start to finish, the acting, the plot, in fact everything bout the film was completely over the top, the guy who played the murderer was dressed in a grey pin-stripped HUGO-BOSS stlye suit, his face was bandged and stapled together with nails and crap that you would find down your local diy shop, the actors and actresses were great fun to watch, purely because the storyline had more holes in it than swiss cheese, the hotel or motel or whatever the place was looked like something straight out of the 1950's.I'll give most films a chance so I'm not going to totally slate the film, the murder scenes where funny to a degree that people were being murdered with drills, hammers and nail guns, every time someone got killed the murder weapon got bigger and better, the final scene was so funny that I recorded it on my video-phone to watch it back and back again, I won't spoil it for you's anymore, in summary the film was abit slow, but the murder scenes and body count were great fun, the plot made as much sense as an ashtray on a motorcycle, watch it if you want a very very cheap laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In one word, 'Megapolicomancy'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very nice film, quick tempo, atmospheric horror that goes far beyond its epidermic theme of teenage serial kill spooks. Although many will be left wondering of the exact use of the symbols and magic patterns in the building, one would get a far clearer idea, once he 's familiar with Thibaut de Castries' "Megapolicomacy" theory, (published in an enigmatic and, these days quite sought for, book, in the beginning on 20th cent.), which apparently has been the major influence of this concept. This was the 3rd film I've watched in a raw (the others were: 'Blade Trinity' -typical Blade- and 'The Damned within the Shadows' -sloooow-) and it left me with the best impression. PS: If you are more impressed by the supernatural element of the movie, than the 'toolbox killer' figure, you may also want to read Fritz Leiber's, horror classic novel, 'Our Lady of Darkness'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incredible that this was released in 2003. I have my suspicions that it was in fact made in 1983 - it plays like a twenty or thirty year old flick. Camera tracking, art-work all look decades old. And yet it has touches of the Hooper flare and refuses point blank to be ignored.Gotta give kudos to some of the deaths, although I was sorely disappointed no one was gutted with a Stanley knife or at the very least a few stabs to the retina with a Philips-head screwdriver.Given that we're talking here bargain-basement actors they do OK. How much talent do you need to run around a room screaming your tits off! Ultimately little more than Jason Voorhees with a toolkit.Not a lot of sense but a modicum of fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sure everyone agrees that Tobe Hooper TOTALLY lost himself a long time ago. He hadn't produced a watchable film in nearly 15 years...and with 'Crocodile,' it looked like his flame had pretty much burnt out forever.Luckily, he set out to recapture it with ?The Toolbox Murders' and it's actually a semi-successful attempt. The material itself is pretty formulaic and hits all the slasher cliches. But everything is elevated by the moody atmosphere, ferocious kills, Angela Bettis' performance, and Hooper's solid direction. Sure, there are a few unintentional laughs and cheap scares?and it won't win any points for originality?but the film has it's bloody heart in the right place and has a lot of energy. Keep it up, Tobe!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the original was better, and that wasn't really good to begin with</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version of "Toolbox Murder" is more akin to a re-imagining as opposed to a straight remake. This features "May"'s Angela Bettis as Nell Barrows along with her hubby, Steven, as the two newest residence of the the worn down Lusman Arms apartment complex. Weird stuff begins to happen which frightens her immensely, she can't confide in her hubby, as he's out working at a hospital all the time So she's glad when she befriends Julia Cunningham (Juliet Landau), her new neighbor, but when Julia disappears suspiciously, Nell takes it upon herself to figure out what happened to her. Alas the apartment has a great many deadly secrets, and Nell might not be too thrilled to find them out.Let's face it the original film, while good, was hardly a classic, so I was hoping this version could easily surpass it. But nope, stock character's that you never really care about, some really crappy acting (was that really May I was watching? How could that actress be so good in that one, and come of as an over-the-top, overacting shrill in this one?), and a hack eyed pointless supernatural plot twist in the middle of the film that NEVER pays off, all combine into a rancid concoction that I just couldn't swallow. In the way the gore scenes were lit didn't help matters one bit. This was supposed to be a return to true form for poor Tobe Hopper after Steven Spielburg defanged most of what he wanted to do with "Poltergeist", but as it turns out this film is only marginally better then "The Mangler" My Grade: D+ DVD Extra: Commentary with director Tobe Hooper, and screenwriters Kace Anderson and Adam Gierasch; Second commentary with producers Jascqueline Quella and Terence Potter, and Journalist Calum Waddell; 5 deleted scenes; footage from a Q&amp;A with Tobe Hooper; Theatrical trailer; and trailers for "Riding the Bullet", "May", "Crocodile", &amp; "Haute Tension"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather solid slasher remake?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Tobe Hooper once entered the horror-hall of fame at the top position back in 1974 with his undeniable masterpiece of imaginative terror, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Ever since that, his career only went downhill. In the nineties he simply?well?sucked with a repertoire of titles like The Mangler and Crocodile. The tide seems to be turning a bit now, as his version of the Toolbox Murders is surprisingly decent and well made. This is a remake of a vicious 70's slasher that is overall gory and disgusting (the original was even included in the `video nasties' ? list of banned horror movies in the U.K) The plot and motivations of the murdering nut are slightly different in Hooper's version of the Toolbox Murders. The story is about a young couple that moves to Hollywood and homes in an old, spooky building. Inhabitants of this building ? mainly wannabe actors and other scum ? brutally die one by one?As the title implies, the butchering is achieved by hammers, drills, screwdrivers and a bunch of other tools. And I bet you can imagine how badly things can get messed up if you're using tools on people, no? Indeed, this films is rather gory and extremely violent with a few gruesome killing-highlights such as a (semi-)decapitation with a sawing machine! Angela Bettis, the girl who stole every horror fan's heart since `May', plays the screaming heroine who slowly gets to the bottom of the murder mystery. She receives good feedback from the beautiful Juliet Landau (Martin Landau's daughter) . The script and story-development isn't always logical and most of the interior shots are under-exposed. Also, the Toolbox Murders seems to give the impression we're guessing fro the identity of the killer initially?like a good old-fashioned ?whodunit' slasher, but the mystery and detective aspects abruptly come to an end as the plot opens up a little more. Far from being an intelligent (or even clever) horror remake, Tobe Hooper's film is entertaining and perfectly suitable for an evening of scares and loud yells.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For director Tobe Hooper this is very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A historic Hollywood hotel (the Lusman Arms) is being totally renovated with residents still in the building. Nell (Angela Bettis) and hunky husband Steven (Brent Roam) move in. Steven is at work most of the time so Nell is alone. She starts hearing strange noises and seeing odd things. Also some masked killer is popping up and killing residents with items found in a toolbox...I never saw the original so I can't compare the two. This is no masterpiece itself. 2/3s of it is pretty good but it bogs down at the end. There's a LONG protracted ending with Bettis and the killer, the explanation of what's happening is sort of vague and the very end is TERRIBLE (leaving the door wide open for a sequel). Still, for director Hooper, this is his best film in years.Even since he did "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" back in the 1970s he's made one mediocre film (and some really BAD ones) after another. This one isn't bad at all. The plot is interesting, the film moves smoothly and the characters are quirky and entertaining. The acting is good across the board--especially Bettis and Roam (who I wanted to see more of). Also Rance Howard has a few nice moments as "Chaz". There aren't many murders but the ones that are there are quick, violent and VERY gory. The killings are done by a nail gun, a power drill, power saw, wire cutters and acid! No great movie put a pretty good, solid horror film. Let's hope Hooper makes more like this...or better! I give it a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent remake courtesy of Tobe Hooper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once upon a time, there was a film director known as Tobe Hooper. This man roared his way into the hearts of horror fans in 1974 with the cult classic that top's many a fans all time list of horror movies; The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Since then, however, Hooper's career has been a constant downward spiral, and in spite of a Spielberg produced ghost story and a sequel to his brilliant debut, Hooper has never managed to get out of his rut. This remake of the 70's trash 'classic' ensures that he still hasn't managed to claw his way out. Don't get me wrong, though, this actually isn't a bad film; but it's very run of the mill, and Hooper's handling leaves a lot to be desired. The reason for this, mainly, is due to the fact that Hooper obviously wanted this movie to be more than it is. All a horror fan expects from a film like this is brutal and gory murders, and the film has them - but it also has the bits in between, and Hooper's attempts to make them interesting fail on every level. The film moves at snail pace between the murders, and all I wanted was another death scene all the time. And that's not good when you're watching what is supposed to be a thriller.As mentioned; the death scenes definitely are good; and the film makes best use of it's title. People are beaten to death with hammers, gored with drills and someone even gets the top half of their head sliced off with an electric sander. And let's not forget my personal favourite implement of death - the nail-gun! It's a shame that Hooper didn't find room for a chainsaw, though. The film has a very polished look throughout, which doesn't do the film many favours as it's supposed to be a remake of a gritty 70's slasher; but on the other hand, it does look nice so you've got to take the rough with the smooth. The plot starts to fall apart towards the end too, as throughout you get the impression that the film is trying to give you a line up of possible suspects; only for the mystery to fall completely flat on it's face at the film's conclusion. Still, while this film isn't all the good; nor is it even a top example of the genre, it's worth a watch and if you like to waste your time; there's worse films for you to waste it on than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A not so great re-imagining of an already not so great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In all fairness, the 1978 version of this movie already wasn't exactly a great or classic one by any means but at least it had as a redeeming quality that it got made in the '70's and therefor had a great typical distinctive '70's movies atmosphere. This movie its only redeeming quality is its gore even though there isn't an awful lot of it in it.This movie chooses a different approach and story than the 1978 movie and therefor this movie is more of a re-imagining than an actual remake. The only thing that has remained the same is the setting of an apartment complex and a killer who uses the content of his toolbox for his killings. This movie uses a more supernatural approach of things, while the original was a pure slasher.Since it's a re-imaging, it obviously also does some things better, compared to the original. The movie picks a main character right on from the start, so the movie is more coherent with its story and characters.But yet it's not a better movie. The movie had some real good potential with its concept but it just forgot to ever get tense. For an horror movie it's also lacking some serious scares and while the build up is good with its suggestive camera work among other things, it just never pays off in the end, since a climax is never really reached in any of its sequences. It's not that this movie is a complete bore to watch but its concept just screamed for a better execution. It's funny how Tobe Hooper has never made a decent horror movie again ever since after "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre", unless you still believe that he also directed "Poltergeist". It's true that the movie gets better toward the end, when things finally start to take off but it's too little too late by then already to still fully save this movie.The movie is definitely dark but I wouldn't exactly describe it as atmospheric. You can say that the atmosphere is too dark, which ruins some of the movie its tension. It's one of the simples things you can do as an horror director; make ever sequence look really dark but this just doesn't necessarily make a movie automatically tense or scary as well.The acting is slightly below par, though definitely still better than the average typical B-horror movie entry. Angela Bettis, Rance Howard and Juliet Landau are all some semi-good and known actors.Not an horrible movie, just not really worth seeing either.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Toolbox Murders is set in a Los Angeles apartment complex called the Lusman Arms where a young doctor named Steven Barrows (Brent Roam) &amp; his wife Nell (Angela Bettis) move in, it's not exactly five star accommodation but what can you do when your on a budget? It's currently undergoing lots of renovation &amp; so there are lots of tools lying around, some of the Barrows neighbours are a little strange too, however Nell befriends Julia (Juliet Landau) whom seems pretty normal by comparison. When Julia mysteriously disappears Nell becomes worried &amp; feels something is not right, Nell investigates the origins of the hotel &amp; discovers a sinister past. Nell also discovers a vicious killer &amp; she becomes his next target...Directed by Tobe Hooper I thought Toolbox Murders was an average horror film &amp; nowhere near as good as the original The Toolbox Murders (1978) which this remake has virtually nothing in common with besides the attention grabbing title. The script by Jace Anderson &amp; Adam Gierasch has an identity crisis, it can't decide whether it wants to be a straight forward gory Friday the 13th (1980) slasher or a more mystery orientated who dun-nit like Scream (1996) &amp; frankly it disappoints on both fronts. For those looking for blood, gore &amp; death you would be best advised to watch the original &amp; those seeking a good mystery should watch something like I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997), there is definitely better out there. The film is a mish-mash of ideas that don't quite gel together including some supernatural elements that strangely go nowhere, the killer himself also disappoints. Again this remake differs in this respect with a completely different killer &amp; their motives &amp; identity are nothing like the original, in this film he is just some deformed freak who just 'is', nothing more nothing less &amp; that's what it boils down too. This is nothing more than a basic slasher with some out-of-place mystery elements that are almost irrelevant. Having said that it's an OK watch with a few decent moments here &amp; there but overall it's nothing to get that excited about.Director Hooper does OK, I felt the film was a bit flat looking &amp; could have used a bit more visual flair &amp; a bit more style especially considering that such an experienced filmmaker like Hooper was behind the camera. The climax is quite well done though with plenty of rotten corpses strewn around &amp; these scenes have a The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) feel about them. The gore is tame &amp; the body count low, someone has their head bashed in with a hammer, someone has a drill shoved through their head, someone gets pumped full of nails when the killer uses a nail-gun on her, someone has their face burned off with acid &amp; someone has the top of their head cut off, it sounds gory &amp; exploitative but it's pretty bloodless &amp; stretched out at nearly 100 minutes isn't enough.Technically Toolbox Murders is alright, it's generally well made with decent production values but there's nothing particularly special on show here. The acting is OK but again nothing special.Toolbox Murders is an average slasher with a hint of mystery which comes to nothing, I can't say I particularly liked it but at the same time I can't say I particularly hated it. Average at best &amp; nowhere near as good or as exploitative as the sleazy original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Toolbox Murders (2004) * 1/2 (out of 4) Remake of the 1970's cult classic has director Tobe Hooper trying to recapture his golden days but failing due to a horrible script that borrows loosely from the original but doesn't improve anything. There's plenty of gore to go around but the main character is way too annoying. I was really hoping Hooper would get his act together but sadly we'll have to wait for his next film, which we've been saying for the past two decades. The 1978 version isn't much better but it at least has a certain charm to it.</fullReview>
