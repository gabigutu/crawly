		<shortDescription>Don't believe the hype! Lame "video nasty".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Banned since 1982" screams the video box. After sitting through an hour and a half of this crud you'll be lining up to have it banned for another twenty years. Not because it's controversial, too violent, or objectionable in any way (except perhaps aesthetically), but simply to save your fellow movie watchers from having to experience this incoherent, pointless mess. And it is a MESS. Badly written, directed and acted, with no redeeming features. And I LIKE horror folks.The first 20 minutes or so features a series of murders of young women by various items from a toolbox - drill, hammer, nail gun,etc. (why a toolbox you ask? Good question...). The victims are all attractive and seem to share a taste for MOR country music. The killer wears a ski mask and sometimes hums to himself. (Maybe he's a country purist and is offended by their lack of Hank Williams?) Anyway, after that the movie rapidly gets duller and duller, a girl gets kidnapped, some inept cops investigate the murders and are baffled, even though you'll pick the killer as soon as you see him. B-grade legend Cameron Mitchell hams it up sucking a lollipop and singing spirituals, and the faceless supporting cast are as bad as the stinker of a script. If you haven't seen 'The Toolbox Murders' well, you haven't missed anything much. Not even bad enough to be funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are you too much of a Gorehound to enjoy the slow segments?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Toolbox Murders starts out with 20 minutes or so of grisly and very well done kill scenes, all of which involve tools. If you like violence, then you'll love the introduction of this film. I personally don't have a preference when it comes to nudity in horror films (since it's overdone and pointless 90% of the time), but if you're a sucker for that sort of thing, then you'll appreciate the introduction to this film for that as well. After the kills are complete, however, many people will be bored by the lack of action that takes place on screen until the final moments of the movie. The middle portion of this movie is a lot of talk with little or no gore. I didn't mind this, because I found the dialog between the killer and the kidnapped girl to be very interesting. "What's it like?" the killer asks, referring to dying. The girl responds that "everything is purple, like a lollipop, and you can't see God, and there are people flying around, and you can see all of their thoughts, and you know the answers to all of their questions, but you can't answer them because nobody can talk." I enjoyed listening to this conversation, and although I'm sure I didn't get it word for word, there is something creative and maybe even worthy in here. Lots of people complain that the acting in this movie is terrible. These people cannot be horror buffs, as I have seen countless other films in which the acting is much MUCH worse. I would go as far to say that the acting in this film is very decent. If you have the attention span to sit through 'slower' moments of this film, then you'll find something to enjoy in it. I give The Toolbox Murders an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly awful - yet strangely watchable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a film that my girlfriend and I rented because it said on the box that it had been "banned for 14 years", or somesuch sensationalist tag. We expected, rather naively, a powerful, shocking attack on society a la Texas Chain Saw Massacre. What we had was some bloke in an unfrightening woolly hat going around and, yep, you guessed it, killing people with a variety of tools. Of these, the initial murder with a drill is the most unpleasant. As the film goes on, however, it clutches at straws, ultimately having to resort to that oh-so-scary object of carpentry, the chisel.Unfortunately, entirely pointless deaths only account for about half the film. Where it really goes wrong is when it begins to justify these with some bizarre "taking revenge on the evils of society" explanation delivered by the one character we were really certain WASN'T the killer, by virtue of his being such an obvious candidate.But for all its faults (and there are many), The Toolbox Murders remains compulsively watchable. This is because its hack dialogue and direction are so unbelievably bad that the viewer is left wondering just what god-awful impersonation of dialogue or technique is going to crop up next. Whole chunks of background information go effectively unexplained, phrases are repeated by characters unnecessarily, and one scene goes on so damn long you can't help thinking it might be a deliberate Chain Saw Massacre-style experiment on the viewer's nerves. But no, it just goes on too long.Two-out-of-ten stuff, then - but one way or another, you won't hit the stop button before the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rodney Dangerfield of Horror films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great Cameron Mitchell is a masked maniac who kills the inhabitants with nail guns, screwdrivers &amp; hammers, before kidnapping Laurie Ballard, a typical yet innocent 15 year old (played by Pamelyn Ferdin who is such a vegetarian that apparently she didn't even accept meaty roles). I really don't understand the general disdain for this fine grind-house film, especial by horror aficionados. The first 30 minutes are classic bloody grind-house shenanigans, while the rest is fun in a hokey, unintentionally humorous dialog type of way. And there's no doubt that Cameron played great nut cases in his career. Better than Tope Hooper's drab and lifeless 2004 re-make (or re-imagining, rather)Eye Candy: Marciee Drake gets topless; Kelly Nichols gets fully nude; and extra nudity in the DVD menus &amp; Extras My Grade: B- Blue Underground DVD Extras: Commentary with producer Tony Didio, cinematographer Gary Graver and actress Pamelyn Ferdin; an interview with actress Marianne Walter (AKA Kelly Nichols); Poster &amp; still gallery; movie poster reproduction; Cameron Mitchell biography; TV spot; 2 Radio spots; and Theatrical trailer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good for misogynistic trash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE TOOLBOX MURDERS is one of the nastier grindhouse horror movies to achieve commercial success and attain an enthusiastic cult following. A series of bizarre murders begins taking place in a Hollywood apartment complex, and the victims are exclusively independent young women. Eventually (SPOILER ALERT), we come to realize that the murders are being committed by the hotel's manager (Cameron Mitchell), who is targeting "immoral" young women as his victims.It seems that his daughter was killed in a car crash after having gotten involved in sex and drug related activities. He is now on a crusade to rid the world of women who have gone down a similar path. In a genuinely twisted subplot, he has become obsessed with a virginal girl in one of the apartments, whom he fantasizes as replacing his daughter. He kidnaps her and keeps her tied to his bed while he goes out and hammers and nail guns his victims.It leads up to one of the most harrowing and unsettling finales I've ever seen in this type of movie. As you can tell, the plot itself is as sordid as one could have thought up. Although it isn't nearly as vile as, say CANNIBAL FEROX or I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, TOOLBOX MURDERS is the kind of slasher movie that makes me reluctantly understand women's groups denouncing the entire subgenre. I don't agree with them, but I can see their point when I watch the movie.While there's no question that the movie is sexist, it never crosses the line into rampant misogyny. Even the movie's now infamous highlight, in which a nude woman is chased throughout her apartment by the nail-gun wielding killer, the victim manages to keep her cool and even tries to reason with the killer (albeit unsuccessfully) despite being in a most vulnerable position. There is enough style to make things interesting and it moves along at a decent pace, so it never gets boring. It's no Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, but it delivers what it promises, something that too many horror movies fail to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nailguns, Hammers, And Drills, Oh My!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Toolbox Murders" is a cheap, gritty movie. It's nasty, gratuitous, and graphic, but it is an okay little horror film. I enjoyed the first half hour or so of "Toolbox". The film is about women in a Los Angeles apartment who are stalked and murdered by a ski-masked killer with various tools. The first thirty minutes of the movie is just basically a bunch of women in a Los Angeles, California apartment complex getting murdered with contents of a toolbox (hammers, drills, screwdrivers, nailguns), and it is pretty graphic. Some of the death scenes are clever (I liked the nailgun scene), but after the first forty minutes the film begins to kind of bore you a bit. After Laurie (Pamelyn Ferdin) is kidnapped by the killer, the film starts to go down hill.From there on it's basically detectives trying to find information on the killer, and the killer has Laurie tied up and is taunting her (this scene has a lot of useless dialog). If the filmmakers had spread the deaths out a bit, rather than having one after another in the first half hour, then the movie might have been a little less boring, because every death scene occurs within the first 30 minutes. But hey, at least they tried something new, not many horror films get the deaths over with so quickly and focus more on the solving of the crime and the killer's captive.I saw this film on DVD, so it included some cut footage that I guess had been banned (I'm assuming it was the bathtub scene and maybe some extra gory shots of the murders - it was a pretty violent slasher film). When I heard Pamelyn Ferdin's voice in the movie, I knew I'd heard it somewhere, and then I discovered that it was from "Charlotte's Web", where she had provided the voice of Fern, so that was a bit of a surprise to me. The rest of the cast wasn't bad either, not great but they were good. Cameron Mitchell played the villain, and was fairly decent. I also read on the cover that Stephen King enjoyed this movie, which was another little surprise.Overall, "Toolbox" is a bit unsettling and disturbing at moments. It's major downfall is the ending half of it though, because the film becomes a bit tedious and boring for the audience. It's no "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (which I think it tried to be), but all things considered, it's an okay little slasher flick. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a criminally underrated sleazy classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It bothers me that many people don't even realize that Tobe Hooper's version of this grindhouse cult classic is a remake. I think that one's okay for a chuckle or two, but this one's the real deal. For some reason, it just makes me nostalgic for an epic period in exploitation film-making that took place in the decade before I was even born. And Cameron Mitchell's involvement in this quirky and uneven flick reminds me of seeing him in tons of old movies on Saturday afternoon TV that was filled with so many commercials that I probably missed all the good stuff.I think possibly Toolbox Murders may have had something to do with precipitating the "gimmick weapon" slasher film craze of later in the 70s and on through the 80s, exemplified by Don't Go In The House, Driller Killer, and Nail Gun Massacre among many others. Sure, Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre started it and even Pete Walker's Frightmare had a drill killer, but I like to just think that Toolboz=x is a historically important film so please don't burst my bubble.Regardless of my sentiments on it, though, Toolbox Murders starts off strong with a handful of stalk and slash sequences highlighted by a sleazy female bathtub masturbation scene that leads to a chase and a nail gun demise. The sleaze and violence levels taper off considerably after that, but that's okay because that's where the predictably "shocking" psychodrama and backstory comes into play--yesssss! Toolbox Murders is one of my favorites, and it's too often overlooked. Give it a look over the mediocre remake if you see it on your video store shelf. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A splendidly scuzzy 70's slasher sleaze classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cameron "I'll act in any piece of junk for the money" Mitchell's already patchy schlock picture career hits its wonderfully lurid and repugnant all-time skankiest gutter-crawling nadir here with his joltingly frantic, bug-eyed portrayal of a crazed, puritanical superintendent who gruesomely dispatches several "sinful" promiscuous harlot young women residing in a grimy Los Angeles apartment complex. This shockingly gross and disgusting scuzzball 70's grindhouse slasher gem reaches its sensationally sleazy apex in a protracted sequence showing gorgeous porn starlet Kelly Nichols joyfully masturbating in her bathtub prior to Cameron brutally butchering her with a nail gun! Tireless ace exploitation photographer Gary Graver did the sharp, polished photography. The incredible down and out cast greatly intensifies the film's singularly discomfiting slimy edge: onetime child actress Pamelyn Ferdin (most famous for doing the voice of Lucy in a few Charlie Brown cartoon TV specials), "Land of the Lost" 's Wesley Eure as Cam's equally demented nephew (!), and the original "The Blob" heroine Aneta Corseaut. To top it all off, we even got a pertinent and provocative subtext about the fragility of innocence (as represented by Ferdin's sweet, "pure" character), the impossibility of preserving said innocence on a permanent basis (Cam abducts Pam so she can serve as a surrogate for the daughter he lost in a car crash), and how innocence is inevitably corrupted and/or destroyed by the evil outside world (as personified by the "impure" women Mitchell on his self-appointed murderous moral crusade deems worthy of punishment through savage and untimely death). This vile, gritty, resolutely ugly and sordid classic wholly deserves its killer trash legend reputation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Come for the grisly deaths, Stay for the deranged psychology!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Toolbox Murders is one of the top 3 American Horror films of the 1970's (along with The Hills Have Eyes, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) IMHO. Like the other films I just mentioned, 'toolbox' has a gritty low budget realism that helps the general atmosphere of the picture to no end. All of these movies deal with ordinary people besieged unexpectedly by deranged psychopaths, whose motives only become apparent as the stories unfold.What makes 'toolbox' special is an absolutely masterful performance by Cameron Mitchell. Although the highly original death scenes are shocking and horrific, it is Cameron's portrayal of a crazed madman that is really unsettling. He really gets behind his motivation to create a flawed man living in an imperfect world. Without giving too much away, I should also note that the plot is very clever, with all kinds of unexpected turns toward the end. Sure, there are some bad scenes here and there, a lame disco lounge, plot holes, and unnecessary characters, but these are all pre requisites of low budget 70's cinema. The Toolbox Murders is recommended for anyone who likes great gore, or even fans of psychological drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat tedious and sickly (but not due to gore!!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard about this film at the start of last year and instantly became deeply intrigued by it. I was overjoyed to see it finally released on the 'VIPCO' video label (here in the UK) but, alas, this all seemed to be in vain. I guess overall it was somewhat of a bathos and failed to rouse any serious interest in me whatsoever. The acting was, at the best of times, marginal and the plot...let's say it wasn't exactly ground-breaking: At the same time though I doubt that director Dennis Donnelly (who has also worked on episodes of 'Dallas' and 'Airwolf'...if I recall from my childhood) was attempting to change the world with the tale of a deranged Ski-mask wearing killer wielding, amongst other items, nail guns and chisels. The killings portrayed are rather nasty and bloody but, as I am now aware, are slightly cut here in the UK. I doubt (sincerely) that if they were shown in their entirety it would have made any valuable difference.Perhaps what I found most disturbing about the film itself was the general visual aspect ( - vague I find you asking yourselves). The film looks very much dated now, which for some may not be a problem but it tended to make me feel decidedly 'sickly'. By this I mean that it just reminds me far too much of photos from my childhood *shudders*...with its ghastly floral interiors and fashion sense. I guess this is just a reflection of my own personal dislike towards nostalgia and is no serious reason to comment negatively on the film.To conclude, 'The Toolbox Murders' is a tedious and poor (sorry to be harsh) horror flick at best. At times it appears to imitate Tobe Hoopers classic 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' in the sense that the film was, allegedly, based on 'real' events. It also follows a fairly congruous and typical narrative: a series of murders followed by an abduction and, inevitably, torture...only to have the attractive protagonist narrowly escape death. The fact that 'The Toolbox Murders' focuses on the notion of the 'family-gone-wrong', a la 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', or Pete Walkers 'Frightmare', for example, only seems to strengthen this argument more. The main problem: it falls flat on its face in trying to do so. I consider myself to be a die-hard horror film aficionado but this was just unfulfilling; certainly not to be mistaken as a 'cult classic'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes you almost feel guilty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The stars of this film are Cameron Mitchell (232 performances in film), Pamelyn Ferdin (71 roles, including The Beguiled), Wesley Eure, and Kent Kingsley.But, the real star of this mystery is Marianne Walter, who started her film career in the King Kong remake. You thought you were seeing Jessica Lange's breast's didn't you? No, they were Marianne's, and she really puts them on display here in her first film role. She gets nailed by the slasher after a long masturbation scene in the bathtub. Someone must have noticed her talent, as she changed her name to Kelly Nichols, and made 84 more films, most of them rated X.This movie has some gruesome murders using tools, but it is not overly bloody. The real interest, aside from Marianne, is who the slasher is, and the reason for the murders, and how it ends. It has some real interesting twists and is made all the more interesting by the fact that is it supposedly based on a true story.You will feel a little guilty watching this misogynistic trash, but it is cinematic history as this is one of the 74 video nasties banned in Britain. It was released with 1 minute and 46 seconds cut in 2000.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>70s Sleaze</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>- A mad killer wearing a ski mask commits a series of violent murders using the contents of his toolbox as weapons. After a teenage girl is kidnapped, the police seem to think her brother is responsible. Can he find his sister and save his own neck in the process? - If I could use one word to describe The Toolbox Murders it would be "sleaze". It's the kind of movie that you want to take a shower after watching. That's not to say I don't enjoy the movie, because I do. The film thrives on blood, nudity, torture, and a variety of inventive kill scenes. Although the nailgun scene may be the most famous, a claw hammer makes for a nasty weapon.- But the main reason to watch is Cameron Mitchell. Here's a little tip for those unfamiliar with Mitchell - if you're watching a horror movie from the 60s or 70s and Cameron Mitchell shows up, expect him to go nuts and start killing people. Mitchell plays a crazy nut-job as good as anyone I've ever seen. He's just a blast to watch.- The rest of the cast is an odd mix of actors. Aneta Corsaut was Helen Crump, Andy Taylor's girlfriend on "The Andy Griffith Show". Wesley Eure was in one of my Saturday morning favorites, "Land of the Lost". And Pamelyn Ferdin was the little girl in just about every television show made in the 60s and 70s. Odd cast, but it works for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*Once again, some nut has it in for beautiful women. "Toolbox murders" are raging at an apartment complex. The cops are baffled. We get to see a couple of brutal murders involving naked, horny women. So far, so good. Then the movie wanders off into the psychology of the madman and proceeds to drop dead. What a shame. However "The Toolbox Murders" does have an outrageously sleazy murder scene that makes it worth seeing once:*EXPLOITATION SCENE SPOILER*The highlight of the film involves a woman taking a bubble bath. The killer waits patiently by the bathroom door as she rubs herself raw underneath the bubbles. After she's done pleasuring herself, he chases her around the apartment with a nailgun. He "nails" her a couple of times and then lovingly puts the final nail through her head. This was one of the greatest scenes in exploitation movie history. Watch this movie just for that scene. The rest of the movie will only hurt you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wesley Eure proves "Land of the Lost" was a step up!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never thought an actor from a campy Saturday morning kids show (Land of the Lost) could find a project even worse, but here we are! I saw this movie at the drive-in back in 1978. Bad acting? Yes! Bad script? Yes Bad lighting and sound? Yes. Horror? A little bit thanks to an item we all have in our homes, a toolbox. Cheap, expliotive trash like this can be enjoyed on a certain level if you check your brain at the door. I think everyone involved in this movie had a late payment on their new car pending or were dire need of some quick cash. Wesley Eure mutters the funniest line in the whole movie! After examining blood stains around an apartment in a rather inquisitive manner he finds a vibrator and picks it up and says "disgusting"! Blood and brains on the wall is okay but I guess a sex toy was just too much for his delicate psyche. Speaking of which the scene in which the victim uses her toy in the bathtub was quite erotic for a 1970's film. Cute, perky Pamelyn Ferdin was attempting to break into adult roles after years of playing kids roles but she should have held out for a better part or at least a more memorable one. Her character gets kidnapped and spends most of the movie gagged, I guess she did get an early copy of the script! After viewing this movie again the 90's I wanted to go to my toolbox and beat myself over the head with my rubber mallet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Opening Cascade of Misogynistic Gore is All Anyone Remembers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Toolbox Murders" is, in many ways, the definitive seventies exploitation movie. (Or "grindhouse movie," if you prefer.) It is sleazy, gory, uncomfortable, campy, boring, melodramatic, effortless, completely unpolished, tonally uneven, and only could have been made in the seventies. It is clear that the film's origins rose out of some skid row producer somewhere looking at the numbers "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" made and thinking, "If that's what you can do with just a chainsaw, let's throw the whole toolbox at them!" It even claims to be based on a true story! The movie's opening twenty minutes is the stuff of slasher/gorefest legend and, rightfully, earned the movie a spot on the UK's Video Nasty list. A man enters an apartment complex, at first appearing to be a normal repairman. Soon, he brandishes an electric drill, with a truly scary looking drill bit, and chases the girl around the room. At one point, the killer dons a ski mask, but at an askew angle, distorting the human face even further. A large chested girl in a thin white t-shirt, clearly not wearing a bra, steps into the shower accidentally, wetting her chest, before disrobing further. She gets murdered with a claw hammer. (With the claw end. Because no slasher movie killer ever uses the blunt side of a hammer.) Another girl wanders in, sees the massive rings of blood on the linoleum floor, and is quickly killed with a screwdriver. The film pauses briefly introduces its main heroine, played by kid-star cutie Pamelyn Ferdin, and kidnaps her before launching into its most memorable moment. A sultry redhead, with earrings in and in full make-up, played by future porn starlet Kelly Nichols, slips into the bath, a painfully sappy pop-duet playing on the radio. Her hands slowly sneak under the bubbles, an enthusiastic masturbation session beginning. (This sequence prompted my viewing partner to say, quote: "Grindhouse movies are great.") Completely preoccupied by her self-administration, the radio playing loudly, the killer sneaks into her apartment unencumbered. As she reaches screaming orgasm, the man in the mask enters the bathroom, humming along to the music, aiming an old fashion nail gun at her. In what Stephen King called his favorite death scene in a horror movie, the girl runs around the apartment completely nude, barely avoiding the flying nails. After, unsuccessfully, attempting to bribe the man with sexual favors (Obviously), she is finally nailed. It's not enough to kill her though. The injured woman stumbles against a poster of herself hanging on the wall. The super-cheesy love song crescendos on the radio. The man shoots her in the head with the nail gun. Blood and brain matter splatter over the narcissistic poster. The scenes cuts away as blood drips down into her pubes. This is slasher movie pop-art.Similar to how the only thing people talk, or remember, about "Trilogy of Terror" is the Zuni Fetish Doll, the opening cascade of misogynistic gore is all anyone remembers about "The Toolbox Murder." It's far to say the fame peaks early. The rest of the movie is devoted to Ferdin's brother and the landlord's son investigating the kid sister's kidnapping. The Scooby-Doo teen sleuthing stuff is dull. The movie reveals fairly early that the landlord, B-movie stalwart Cameron Mitchell, is the killer, in a great reveal of the toolbox. He has the girl tied up in his bedroom. While there's not much to the scenes of Mitchell going on about his dead daughter and how corrupt and impure the world is, it is a joy to see him ham it up. Mitchell goes full-crazy, jumping around, lips quivering, very convincingly playing the kind of traumatized, delusional moralizer that you'd expect to go on a power tools themed murder spree. The plot twist at the start of the third act comes out of nowhere but it also revitalizes the movie. Because you can't have a true sleaze-murder flick without a little rape, a hugely uncomfortable sexual assault happens. (Thankfully, it's mostly off-screen.) The story wraps up kind of unsatisfactory while the film tries to convince us it really is based on a true story, no really, seriously guys, we swear.I could probably go into a long diatribe about why we enjoy films like this, what that says about our culture, my specific generation of young people, etc. I won't do that for brevity's sake. If you're looking for an introduction into the sleazy, sometimes disturbing world of grindhouse cinema, I don't think I could find a better one then "The Toolbox Murders." Buy it on Blu-Ray! It features one of my all time favorite taglines: "Bit by bit? He carved a nightmare!" Someday, I'm going to start a horror-themed metal band and make a song based around that one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertainingly nasty slasher trash.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A warning to the unaware: the "toolbox murders" of the title don't take up very much of the screen time. They're merely a prelude to some sordid, twisted melodrama that some viewers merely find boring. But if you don't mind this shift in focus, you should find sticking with this movie to be worth it. Certainly the acting is bravura stuff; some of the performers take a great delight in their roles.A maniacal handyman uses the implements to be found in his trusty toolbox to slaughter the female tenants in an apartment complex. The incredibly stupid detective on the case doesn't once think of an obvious course of action. (So the movie may lose some viewers on that basis as well.) And before long young Laurie Ballard (cute and perky former child actress Pamelyn Ferdin ("The Beguiled") is abducted by the killer and held captive.Cameron Mitchell, seemingly an actor who could never turn down a paycheck, is the star of this junky but oh so amusing nonsense. Co-starring as his nephew is Wesley Eure of 'Land of the Lost' fame; Aneta Corsaut ('The Andy Griffith Show') and Nicolas Beauvy ("The Cowboys") play Laurie's mom and brother. And cast as the detective is Tim Donnelly (brother to director Dennis Donnelly), who appeared on the TV series 'Emergency!' and went on to be the star of "The Clonus Horror". You really have to hand it to Mitchell: he does NOT phone it in here. Marianne Walter, better known as veteran porn actress and makeup artist Kelly Nichols, has a memorable bit as a victim who pleasures herself in the bathtub (to the strains of a touching country ditty dubbed "Pretty Lady") before the Toolbox Murderer comes calling.Basing itself on some supposedly "true story" (as text at the end indicates), this is undeniably entertaining stuff for those with a taste for the sick and seamy, and it just grows more and more grim as it goes along, accompanied by an incredibly haunting score by George Deaton. Legendary cameraman and d.p. Gary Graver handles the cinematography.Even if it's not for everybody, one can't deny that this movie does have its moments.Followed by a 2004 remake directed by none other than Tobe Hooper.Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Toolbox Murders" opens with a string of brutal and bloody killings at a small apartment complex in Los Angeles.An unknown assailant wearing a ski mask kills various sexually active and 'lewd' women.The nude murder scene of Marianne Walter with a nail-gun is the most noteworthy and has to be seen to be believed.Unfortunately after four gory and misogynistic murders the film becomes pretty tiresome kidnap/captivity/detective psychodrama.Come on!The first half of "The Toolbox Murders" blew my mind with its sleaze and unflinching violence.The climax is also disappointing and abrupt.The acting is good with excellent central performance of Cameron Mitchell as the Toolbox Slasher.Overall,"The Toolbox Murders" is a solid exploitation sickie.A must-see for fans of "Maniac","Don't Go in the House" or "Born for Hell".8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent slow paced slasher..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having stated in other reviews I've done that I'm a big fan of slashers and a collector of horror movies, it was pretty obvious, The Toolbox Murders was on my to-review list. I finally got around to watching this movie earlier this year. It had been on my list to watch for a while, but I just didn't get around to it due to whatever reasons, and one of them was, most movies with over blown hype don't live up to expectations. The others were I was just too busy with watching other horror movies I hadn't got watching, but here I am finally after watching it. Whilst The Toolbox Murders certainly didn't live up to its UK "video nasty" status, it was none the less an enjoyable slasher for those who can give it the patience and time it requires. The story unfolds with a series of grisly but relatively not so graphic murders around an apartment block committed by a rather large man in a ski mask. This takes up the first portion of the movie which is around 25 minutes to 30 minutes. The music in the film, is pretty awesome, and that alone has earned it a few extra stars it might not have got had it not of been for the music featured in the movie. I absolutely love the first song played to the first murder scene in the film - it is awesome. Anyway, pretty much after the series of grisly murders which takes place, the movie is slowed down to a crawl in a detective based story to find out what, why and who is doing all these murders. The storyline is not, at best, that great and the movie certainly takes its toll on pace and editing - the latter I believe they didn't do too much of. The acting isn't too bad, but neither is it too good, it's just more or less standard here. As the movie progresses it becomes apparent who the serial killer is, and we get to find out some interesting dialog in the 'bedroom scene' about why he has killed all the people he did, and he tries to justify what he did. The scene itself is interesting to watch, and is probably the best bit of dialog in the whole movie. There's somewhat of a happy ending too.The Toolbox Murders is just one of these movies where if one little thing had of been left out, it wouldn't have been really worth the watch. In this case, it most certainly goes to the music during the first 40 minutes of the movie, which seems to make the film feel more smoothly. It'll definitely take dedicated fans of the slasher/"video nasty" genre to appreciate it, and to give time to allow the movie to slowly pace along after the first 20 minutes or so. If you can bare with it, and appreciate it, The Toolbox Murders will leave you somewhat entertained. Don't believe all the hype though about how violent or shocking it is, by today's standards the movie is not that explicitly violent. It seems rather tame.I can't say I didn't enjoy it or I did enjoy it - it falls somewhere in between and I'll probably give The Toolbox Murders a few more viewings before leaving it in the DVD rack for a while. If it had not of featured the music it does have, it'd probably get a 5 from me, but because the music tremendously makes this movie, I've given it a low-end 7.There's two DVD releases that I know of, and they're the Blue Underground release in the US, and a VIPCO DVD release in the UK. The Blue Underground release has a lot of extra features, is remastered, and is uncut. The VIPCO 2000 UK DVD release is a bare-bones-less-then-average DVD quality release, and is cut by over 1 minute which removes the scene of the girl getting shot in the back and head with the nail gun, and the entire scene where she's in the bedroom pleading with the killer. So I think it's obvious which DVD release to go for. Though, by today's standards, the movie should pass for an '18' in the UK uncut with ease.As I said, it requires patience and understanding to enjoy the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nudity + misogyny + violence = unmissable exploitation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>30 minutes in, and The Toolbox Murders is shaping up to be one of the greatest exploitation movies in cinema history: four sexy women, all living on the same apartment complex, are violently butchered by their power-tool wielding, ski-mask wearing landlord (Cameron Mitchell, playing yet another nut-job). Victim number one is dispatched via electric drill; number two gets a claw hammer to the skull; unlucky lady number three is stabbed with a screwdriver; and number four gets plugged with a nail-gun (but not until she has finished rubbin' her nubbin in the bath?a rather explicit and very memorable turn by future porn-star Kelly Nichols).Unfortunately, after this excellent start, director Dennis Donnelly slows things down a touch in order to try and tell a story, and the rest of the film never quite manages to regain the intensity (or sleaze factor) of the opening scenes. That's not to say that you should give up watching after half an hour, it's just that the best bits are definitely packed in at the beginning.The next time the lunatic attacks, he doesn't kill; instead, he abducts pretty 15-year old Laurie Ballard (Pamelyn Ferdin). In his confused mental state, he believes her to be his dead daughter (who died after getting involved with 'undesirables') and wishes to preserve her innocence by keeping her tied up at his place. After all, he doesn't want her ending up like all of the 'wicked' women that he has been disposing of, does he?From this point on, the film becomes much more of a psychological horror/suspense movie, as a terrified Laurie lays bound to a bed whilst her brother Joey (Nicolas Beauvy) tries to find out what has happened to his little sis, with the 'help' of Kent, his nutty landlord's equally nutty nephew.And although nothing in the latter part of the film quite matches the grisly sensationalist and misogynistic action to be witnessed in the opening scenes, Donnelly doesn't entirely forget that this is an exploitation flick, and sees fit to include a rather nasty moment in which Joey is burnt to death, and another which sees poor Laurie raped by her brother's killer (this occurs off-screen, but still leaves a nasty taste in the mouth).The Toolbox Murders is a classic grind-house slasher which I thoroughly recommend to like-minded gore-hounds and lovers of trashy horror everywhere. 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"He got her with a nail gun."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>~Spoiler~ With the release of Tobe Hooper's remake/re-imagining, I thought it high time I seek out this drive in classic. From the get-go, this thing has style. I really dug the non-traditional flashbacks. It actually took me a few seconds to realize they were indeed flashbacks. After a few of these quick flashbacks and some eerie dialogue from a preacher on the radio, the film gets real dirty, real fast. We witness three brutal murders. The titular Toolbox murderer goes from apartment to apartment and mutilates three beautiful women. The first with a power drill, the next with a hammer, and the last with a screwdriver. Even more unsettling is the fact that the backdrop music for this mayhem is George Deaton's "Carolina in the Morning." In fact, all of the killings are juxtaposed with Deaton's warm and cozy cowboy songs. The best of these is the Marianne Walter death and Deaton's "Pretty Lady." The pairing is cinematic genius. Ms. Walter is bathing and slowly touching herself; she seems to be really enjoying her body. The next thing you know Deaton's lyrics are saying "Take me to your secret place" and Ms. Walter is masturbating (I felt this scene was quite shocking even by today's standards). After witnessing this, the killer bursts in with a nail gun and chases down the naked starlet. He eventually shoots the "pretty lady" and the nails penetrate her flesh. I'm telling you Freud would have a field day. That scene speaks volumes about the slasher sub-genre. It was my favorite scene in the movie, and I hear Stephen King loves that one as well. One big complaint from most viewers is that it slows down after the initial murders. I didn't have a big problem with this because I had always heard this was the case, and was prepared for the film to drag here. The many plot twists near the end liven things up a bit. It's pretty unpredictable for sure. Cameron Mitchell, from such acclaimed films as Space Mutiny and The Demon, is the only name star here and he gives a damn good performance; the best I've seen from him actually. He's over the top and pitch perfect. The film certainly lives up to it's sleazy exploitation status.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This may be sleazy, gory, and gratuitous, but it's got a point in there (Spoilers may follow)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just hear me out, you. Okay. Is "The Toolbox Murders" really sadistic and gory? Yes, even if many of us have seen films much more sadistic and gory. Is this film very sleazy and perverted? It sure is, but what the hell? At the same time, is it still an interesting piece of social commentary? Yes, it really is. In the film, Cameron Mitchell plays a really wacked-out killer stalking women he views as "sinful" and sadistically punishing them with murder by various types of garage tools. He kills over things from masturbation to sexual promiscuity to drinking, all because he flipped out about the ugliness of society as he sees it after the death of his beloved daughter. He kidnaps one teen girl because she seems pure to him and reminds him very much of his daughter. In fact, he believes that she IS his daughter. Her brother comes looking for her, and ends up getting offed in a fairly eerie and disturbing scene by one of his friends, who is Mitchell's equally screwed-up nephew. I believe that this film has some very important things to say of religious fanaticism. It deals with the traumas that can be born out of and spread to others through one's desperate clutching for purity and goodness. What happens with the nephew is a great example of how these fanatics can screw up their own family even generations below the original psychotic freak. The suburban setting, the bloody baby doll, the fact that Mitchell's twisted religious obsessions drove his own nephew further into the abyss... It's all part of a very important commentary, an intelligent and artistic commentary that belies all of the film's excesses. I love "The Toolbox Murders", it's a warped classic that does plenty right while discarding of all the rules.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated and Misunderstood '70's Horror Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some reviews call this movie sleazy; to some degree it is. Some might say it lacks action in the last two acts; that's partially true as well. But this film is something different entirely. In the genre of serial killer-exploitation, female characters are routinely objectified. But "The Toolbox Murders" is a rare feminist exploitation film. It twists the genre on it's head and gives it an entirely different angle on female roles in horror.The film starts with some suitably gory murders, seemingly setting the stage for a by-the-books slasher movie. But after these first murders (SPOILERS) the killer kidnaps a young girl and keeps her in his home as his surrogate daughter (his own died in a car accident). The killer reveals that he chose his female victims because of supposed moral transgressions. These transgressions are sins of the "modern woman" (sexual freedom, freedom of choice, etc.) and he wants to keep his new "daughter" as a pure, virginal woman.The movie twists and turns, but it's mostly psychological. It plays with genre conventions, such as a woman's savior almost always being a male figure, and changes them. In the end, she is seen by her attackers as a porcelain doll to be manipulated, not a real human being. (SPOILERS) She eventually is capable of saving herself; no man is needed.The direction is fine, the acting is okay for a low-budget '70's horror movie, but the uniqueness of this film is its greatest quality. Many viewers came to this movie expecting a cookie-cutter serial killer movie, and that's not what "The Toolbox Murders" gives you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nasty little horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers!THE TOOLBOX MURDERS is one nasty little horror film. Very misogynistic and exploitive. The first half of the movie just shows a masked killer slashing, impaling, drilling women with various working tools. But then after the gruesome start, the film eventually concentrates on the killer's obsession with a girl he doesn't kill but kidnaps. The kidnapped girl's brother searches for his sister, which leads to his eventual murder (which is sorta sick as well). In fact, everyone pretty much dies by the end of the movie except for one survivor. Guess who it is? Even with its uber sleazy aspect (there's a scene where a woman pleasures herself which is startling), I still recommend this low budget movie, to fans of exploitation flicks and to movie fans in general who want to see how cinema from the 1970s was really out there, in terms of violence and sex. Even Stephen King liked it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat overblown exploitative slasher effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following a spate of brutal murders, a young man and his friend set out to find the culprit in the crimes when his sister gets abducted by the maniac and held hostage to prevent her from following in the victims' footsteps.On the whole this was a decidedly disappointing effort that doesn't really have all that much going for it. When this one was right, it's unbelievably effective and grisly which is what basically amounts to the first few minutes here which is about as prime exploitative fodder as can be expected at a time like this as the series of kills in this section is outright brutal and shocking. The chase around the apartment with the drill that cuts up her arms before finally delivering the knockout blow to the back of the head, the shockingly casual scene of another victim is knocked out and carried into a stairwell where she has her head smashed in with a claw hammer, dragged back into her apartment when a friend finds the body, tries to flee but is grabbed, bashed to the floor, and has a screwdriver slowly pushed into her. That all these murders happen with absolutely no let up is what's unbelievably shocking about these, letting the gore flow freely and easily here through the merciless scenes before getting to the infamous assault on the nude bather who traps her in the apartment and dispatches her with utterly cruel and deadly nail-gun shots that show truly exploitative full- frontal shots with a relish for the more exploitative aspects of the victims' suffering. The pedestrian-like nature of these kills is such that it really does feel that the psychotic handyman is going about his everyday duties, humming peacefully as he goes, and nothing is out of the ordinary. Sadly, this is the first half-hour of the film and from there the film goes so down-hill the drabness that follows slows the film down to such a crawl that barely anything here is worthwhile. The fact that the torture scenes are incredibly tame and result more in his sweet-natured disposition to the situation of having her tied up that the torture actually comes from his rather lame singing and actually holding her hostage while none of whatever else happens to her is all that terrifying. Likewise, the slasher movie elements end and settles into a police procedural rut with a subplot between the lead detective and her mother which ultimately goes nowhere as her brother plays amateur sleuth when he agrees to clean the crime scenes, ultimately turning up evidence in the case but is altogether ignored with most of his findings being dismissed until the finale when it becomes altogether obvious. As well, despite the one murder it's not really all that nasty as the action is handled listlessly, being brutal but with zero suspense that they actually have little real impact. This really could've been something special but otherwise it's pretty drab overall.Rated R: Full Nudity, Graphic Violence, Language and strong scenes of female masturbation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad video nasty, got slow half way through</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This late 70s exploitation slasher film begins brilliantly with a series of murders done by a man dressed in black with a ski mask, using tools from a toolbox to kill his victims in different ways.The first part of this film alone goes well with other slasher films of the 70s and 80s but unfortunately half way through the film, you find out who the killer is and most of the time after that you pretty much have him talking to a girl that he kidnapped and tied up on a bed. It all gets pretty slow from there.Claims to be based on a true story, probably trying to cash in on the more famous slasher film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Not bad for what it is, could of been more interesting at the second half of the film but it's forgiven for the first half which is brilliant for it's type of film.</fullReview>

Perpetuating a stereotype here it seems.Cam ain't happy with the looseness of said ladies so he slowly (and I do mean slowly) invades their space and kills them. The title gives away the implements used so I would not be remiss mentioning the drill and nail-gun scenes. And I go anyone in the room double or nothing the producers of 'Nail Gun Massacre' got their idea here.Some of the actresses were porno vets either trying to do 'legit' films or hired due to their willingness to show it all and touch same. The lass killed by the aforementioned nail gun was masturbating in the bath at the time.Cam covers himself with a ski mask which makes his appearance almost trite these days. But while there were enough scares to make this decent....it did move a bit to slow and got repetitious by the third act. For Cam Mitchell and slasher prototype fans only.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frustrating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, watching "The Toolbox Murders" is a maddening experience. How can you *not* be vexed by a film that gets off to a solid (if unspectacular) start, approaches brilliance, fizzles into dullness, tepidly attempts to redeem itself, and finally screeches to a halt in laughably awful fashion? I like the fact that director Dennis Donnelly employs a nontraditional storytelling formula (at least for the horror film) here; it makes "The Toolbox Murders" oddly compelling, if not consistently interesting. I also like the setting: there's something about the slightly run-down apartment complex that makes the lives of the victims seem so sordid and hopeless. The horror to which the viewer is subjected in this movie is distinctly American--it is the horror of a nation that saw the '60s come to a grisly end with the rampages of the Zodiac Killer and the Manson Family, a nation struggling with the hangover from the previous decade that Son of Sam represents. This ghastly emptiness is underscored in the film's one near-great moment, when Cameron Mitchell kills adult film star Kelly Nichols with a nail gun. I don't think I've ever heard a song used to such potent and fascinating effect in a film as George Deaton's 'Pretty Lady' in this scene. Unfortunately, it's all downhill from there. The movie shifts from the deadly seriousness of the murders and Pamelyn Ferdin's abduction to Nicolas Beauvy and Wesley Eure awkwardly exploring the apartments where the killings occurred, and this portion of the film bears more resemblance to an episode of "ABC Afterschool Specials" than anything else (which I'm sure was not Donnelly's intention). There's a slight improvement when Mitchell delivers a lengthy monologue to the bound and gagged Ferdin, but the material isn't written well enough to impart any truly special quality to the scene; it passes muster only because Mitchell handles his lines so deftly. The bottom drops out of the film altogether during its final ten or fifteen minutes, when things cease to make any sense. Why is Eure's character as crazy as his uncle (Mitchell)? Is it something genetic, or is the viewer just supposed to assume that the death of Mitchell's young daughter--Eure's cousin and secret lover--drove them *both* off the deep end? And why does Eure set Beauvy on fire, citing his responsibility to protect his uncle, only to taunt and kill Mitchell just minutes later? What was probably intended to frighten the audience ("Look, the whole family's insaaaaane!!!") and make them wince in shocked disbelief is an abysmal failure. If you're in a good mood, you'll snicker at the ridiculous conclusion. If not, you'll wonder bitterly why the director and screenwriters botched a film that had such potential. The considerable strength of "The Toolbox Murders" lies in its early scenes; after that, it really becomes a different movie, and not a particularly good one. But every horror aficionado should see it, if for no other reason than to be convinced that a graphic murder scene involving a nude woman can be handled tastefully, and with depth. The stark opening and closing theme (synthesizer overlaid with piano and strings) is very effective, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only thing missing is a strangulation by measuring tape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sick little number has all the poise and artistic elegance of a porno flick, but some truly shocking and memorable sequences and the haunting image that ends this film leave the viewer feeling genuinely disturbed and unnerved, making The Toolbox Murders a movie that ultimately presents its uncompromising vision adeptly.The film is flawed on many fronts, and at times tedious, so this certainly isn't a candidate for the "classic" category. The titular killings all take place within the first half-hour, and after that the pace slows to a crawling bore that The Toolbox Murders almost doesn't recover from.Far too much time is spent on an ultimately pointless police investigation subplot, which does nothing to augment the horror of the admittedly ghastly crimes. Only those familiar with the Hershell Gordon Lewis cult classic Blood Feast will recall ever seeing police officers as inept and clueless as the ones tracking the madman here, who aren't shy about letting potential witnesses walk all over their crime scene, and insist on questioning them while they stand over the brutally maimed corpses of the victims. When the main detective treats one of the film's attempted heroes like a jackass for suggesting that the fact there isn't any forced entry into the murder sites could suggest that the victims knew their killer, we quickly suspect that this is one case that won't be solved by tireless police work.The film resolves its whodunnit two-thirds into the running time, so any suspense in this caper is dissipated far too early. While there is a meager attempt at a twist afterwards, only the well-crafted denouement saves the movie from falling flat at the finish. I'm fairly certain that the film's "based on true events" allegation is a bogus ploy, but the where-are-they-now update at the end is a nifty way to conclude the tale, especially since it runs with the film's eerie final image in the background. The centerpiece of the film is of course the toolbox murders themselves, which are indeed gruesome and gory bits of mayhem. The splatter on display here is unflinching and definitely graphic enough to appease gore-hounds, but the film spends itself too quickly, packing in all of the killings into such a rapid succession that they blur together a bit and desensitize the viewer to the point that the bloodshed ceases being shocking. Had the film-makers drawn the mystery of the murders out more, and spaced them out throughout the film, these scenes could have had much more impact, and when we finally learn the diabolical motives of the killer, the killings themselves become essentially pointless. Although, it should be pointed out that the madman's (madmens'?) true intentions are suitably creepy and horrifying even without the killing spree that precedes them.Some of the film's successes are happy accidents, such as the drab colors and unattractive surroundings the events occur in. Of course, this is more a reflection of the interior decorating trends of the late '70s than a conscious effort by the film-makers to set these ugly deeds in ugly places, but the tone of the film is certainly enhanced by the bleak atmosphere.The music is uniformly great, as well, with both the score and the augmentation of one murder scene with a song called "Pretty Lady" setting a chilling tone for the more heinous segments of the film.While the film is assuredly far too grim and humorless to make this a standard dose of escapist slasher fare, one scene perhaps goes too far and momentarily veers the film into unsavory territory. I've always been unsettled by certain modes of juxtaposing sex with violence that turn up in horror films from time to time. The most blatant example I can think of is of course I Spit On Your Grave, which unabashedly tries to arouse the viewer with horrendously violent carnal images, and we've also seen a great deal of this irresponsible overlapping during the torture porn boom that characterized far too many of the genre offerings of the early 21st century. An extended bathtub masturbation scene in The Toolbox Murders, which shows an attractive actress pleasuring herself with the same thoroughness that the bloodshed in the film is rendered with, is clearly meant to sexually excite the viewer. But when the money shot of this soft-core fantasy is the woman's prolonged and nearly torturous dispatch via nail-gun, there is an uncomfortable ambiguity of intent on the part of the film-makers. Thankfully, the bulk of the film isn't nearly as misogynistic, and the affair as a whole is certainly more manageable as a result.Despite its iffy pace and unpleasant elements, the better aspects of The Toolbox Murders offer it some merited points of interest for discerning horror fans. You probably won't want to visit this blood-soaked apartment complex often, but the film is certainly worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take a 70s primetime television director with aspirations to milk off the successes of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre with a gorier sleazier misogynistic exploitation piece of his own. Add b-movie legend Cameron Mitchell and Welsey Eure (Will Marshall of Saturday morning's Land of The Lost fame) and Pamelyn Ferdin with very realistically disturbing on screen murders involving hand- and powertools, a sexy steaming hot bathtub scene involving female masturbation (featuring future porn queen Kelly Nichols in her debut role under the name Marianne Walter) that leads into one of the most pleasing murder set pieces ever, and for icing one whacky twist that introduces another yet whackier twist. Yeah, it doesn't feature wall to wall gore and the 7 minute body count like later films such as Maniac and Friday The 13th and the ensuing arrival of the notorious slasher in the early 1980s and the toolbox murderer takes no more female victims after the first half hour but this vintage exploitation sleaze left a wonderful taste to my palate. I loved it. SPOILER! SPOILER! SPOILER! Before the final credits when Pamelyn Ferdin is walking like a zombie in a blood drenched dress armed with the scissors in the early dawn across the strip mall parking lot I couldn't resist a sigh and a smile.SPOILER!

		<fullReview>I gotta say I really enjoyed The Toolbox Murders. Its a movie that doesn't quite do what you expect, but wrongfoots you nicely and keeps you gripped right up till a classic twisted finale, which takes this to the realms of awesomeness. As other reviewers will tell you this film starts with a flurry of murders and then slows down, something which has put off many, but I actually thought the murders weren't great (apart from one). See, the sequences have an appropriate amount of mean spirit and suspense about them, but when it gets to the crunch each time, the film is shot such a way as to appear edited, slightly grisly but only affording brief glimpses, which is a bit disappointing. Having said that, one is an absolutely sleazy gem involving a nailgun so it isn't too bad. Once the film slows down it becomes more of a character piece, with some decent performances including sweet and innocent Pamelyn Ferdin, off centre Wesley Eure and, on very fine form, Cameron Mitchell. He gives a performance of sufficient low key gripping intensity that the film is a nervous treat whenever he is on screen. Dennis Donnelly's direction, though not so tight on the gore creates a real feeling of twisted foreboding throughout and the film has a great sickly 70's look to it, oddly atmospheric. This is, for me a pretty great film. I naturally love these sorts of movies and though The Toolbox Murders has more of a reputation for grue than it deserves, and isn't one of the nastier Video Nasties I would still highly recommend it to fans of freakish cult classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A reasonable exploitation movie which sets out at a sprint but runs out of steam in the final reel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "Toolbox Murders" isn't a bad exploitation movie but it's far from achieving classic status. Dennis Donnelly's low-budget grindhouse film moves quickly once the opening credits have finished - we are shown a series of violent attacks in an apartment block on a number of attractive women. Each attack, carried out by a ski-masked psycho with a toolbox and a penchant for whistling as he works, is different but retains a DIY theme. So, we have death by nail-gun, death by chisel, etc.There's a fair bit of female nudity on display in these early scenes, including an eye-opening bathtub masturbation scene. Accompanied by a funky '70s soundtrack, the gore sequences aren't memorable in the way that they are in a good "Friday the 13th" installment but the scenes are shown in such rapid succession so there's no time for boredom to set in.Sadly, the film runs out of steam towards the end. Once the identity of the killer is known (although it's hardly a shocking revelation), the movie changes pace and becomes a little tired. Well, a lot tired, to be honest.Still, I've seen a lot, lot worse. 6 out of 10. Good but not great, I preferred Hooper's recent remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much decried 70's gore/sexploitation flick, most often noted only as a misogynistic opus, does (in fact) actually have some interesting views on the psychology of loss and dementia.At a Californian apartment complex, one dark night a masked intruder stalks the building and violently murders several of the female tenants. While the police struggle for clues, the killer strikes again, only this time kidnapping an adolescent girl. Time is running out for her brother and his friend to find her.Though usually labeled a slasher, it is only in part. After the lengthy opening murder spree, the film settles down into something more like an Italian giallo feature, with the police following red-hearings and the violence (while still very brutal) comes in mostly quick bursts.A note on the violence; yes, it is very bloody and yes, it is almost exclusively targeted at women. The murders also take on a sexual nature in that a couple of the girls are done-in while in partial or full undress; on one occasion, the killer waits until a girl has finished masturbation before doing his thing.It isn't until the final 3rd of the film that is begins to develop into something more than cheap exploitation. After the killer's identity is revealed (which is desperately easy to guess) there is a series of interesting conversations between the killer and the kidnapped girl that reveal a lot of back story for the killer and even generate a little (and I do mean little) sympathy. A few plot twist come up and it all concludes on a very down beat note.Given the films dark and graphic nature, both in terms of visuals and subject matter, it's hard to recommend this to most viewers; genre fans only, please.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as nasty as some say, but a little disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****SPOILERS****Many people have said this is a nasty horror film, but I beg to differ. Toolbox certainly does have some disturbing elements, but when looked at as a whole it doesn't even scratch the surface of some of the nasties before or after it. It's about this apartment owner who takes it upon himself to rid the complex of the morally reprehensible tenants that occupy within. I'll leave the reasoning behind his actions for film, though it wasn't as extreme as I was lead to believe. Entertaining, Toolbox should be of some interest to those who like their films a little rough around the edges. One hell of a twist of an ending, it is a slightly above average murder film, but certainly the not to be placed in the horror category. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsettling Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the age of DVD. I had been looking endlessly for this film on videotape to no avail, then along comes the special edition DVD. The film details the murders of "sinful" women who perform "unnatural acts" by a madman who has recently lost his own daughter.It has been said that Cameron Mitchell's performance is "over the top", but I don't believe so. To his credit, I think he did a fine job and brought both pain and depth to his performance. He could still deliver even in the twilight of his career. Happily, Cameron Mitchell got to go out on top with an outstanding performance in the film "My Favorite Year".The cast is good, the story disturbing and the 70s fashions are enough to damage your retinas. Order pizza, grab a beer, call some friends and enjoy the show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Why Women and Tools Don't Go Well Together!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Incredibly misogynistic film about an insane man that has sexual repressions who brutally murders women only to end up kidnapping a younger girl to care for(?) This film paces through the first four murders of pretty women with virtually no heart. One woman is drilled to death, another hammered, another literally "screwed" with a screwdriver, and the fourth nail-gunned down. The murders are done by a man in a ski mask while pop tunes from the 70s play in the background as they are played in real time on a phonograph and radios. The rest of the film, as has been previously mentioned, does not live anywhere near the pace of the first 20 minutes. I'm thankful for that! Now, I don't think this movie is wholly trash. Sure, I found the woman-hating tone definitely disturbing. It is. The misogynistic bent is strong as women that are young and pretty seem to be ripe objects for inhumane brutality. But that aside, there are some things that were cleverly done. Some of the director's shots are pretty creative. The acting is generally acceptable. Cameron Mitchell always at least gives a performance. That can not be said of all actors. Pamelyn Ferndin, former child star and the voice of early Charlie Brown shows and Charlotte's Web, gives a decent turn as the terrorized teen. The middle section of the film was pretty decent while the mystery was being investigated by the police and family of the kidnapped daughter. The film really falls apart at the end when one of the most ridiculous endings is soldered on and makes little sense. The ending is such poor scripting that it really makes much of the film become very trite. I even found the end disclaimer that this film was based on a real story somewhat implausible(whether it be or not) because the ending tore away what little credibility the film might have had. The end result is a film that is brutal with little point and little feeling. Director Dennis Donnelly must take most of the credit for that. This is one of the few times when I will heartily recommend the remake - which has little in common with this film other than the title and the means of murder - which is a much more innovative film with a script leaps and bounds beyond this rubbish. Oh, it has some guy named Tobe Hooper directing it as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You dirty filthy fornicator." Classic exploitation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Toolbox Murders starts as an apartment complex is terrorised by a spate of brutal murders committed by a ski-mask wearing psycho. Detective Mark Jamison (Tim Donnelly) is on the case but there are few clues to go on. An attractive young woman named Dee Ann (Kelly Nichols as Marianne Walter) is taking a bath while listening to some bad country music, she also happens to be 'pleasuring' herself if you know what I mean. As Dee Ann masturbates in the bath the ski-masked psycho breaks into her apartment, she quickly becomes his latest victim as he brutally murders her with a nail-gun. In the apartment above a teenage girl named Laurie Ballard (Pamela Ferdin) is speaking on the phone when the ski-masked psycho creeps up on her &amp; renders her unconscious. Laurie's brother Joey (Nicolas Beauvy) &amp; mum Jo Ann (Aneta Corsaut) arrive home &amp; realise that something is wrong, especially after they get word of what happened to Dee Ann in the apartment below. Since the police aren't being much use Joey decides to find his sister himself &amp; enlists the help of a friend named Kent Kingsly (Wesley Eure) whose uncle Vance (Cameron Mitchell) owns the apartment complex. Can Joey find &amp; save his sister Laurie before she becomes the next victim of the Toolbox Murders?Directed by Dennis Donnelly I actually rather liked The Toolbox Murders, it's unashamed exploitation that thankfully doesn't try to be anything else. The script by Neva Friedenn, Robert Easter &amp; Ann Kindberg gets off to an absolute flier of a start with four gruesome murders within the first twenty or so minutes, The Toolbox Murders then goes into a bit of a lull for the next hour as it concentrates on Laurie's kidnapping, Joey's search for her &amp; the ski-masked psycho's reasoning behind his brutal crimes. The film then comes to life again ten or so minutes before the end when a fairly effective &amp; satisfying twist is revealed which I really liked. I'm not sure if this was intended as a mystery as the killers identity is kept secret behind his 70's ski-mask at first but is soon revealed not long after the opening murders, it might have helped if the filmmakers had tried to retain &amp; continue the mystery. But at it's heart The Toolbox Murders is pure exploitation of the kind which simply doesn't get made anymore, female masturbation, barking mad psycho's with silly motives, a totally bizarre twist ending that comes from nowhere, some gory &amp; brutal murders looking like it was all filmed on a budget that probably wouldn't cover Tom Cruise's cigar bill! I found The Toolbox Murders to be a highly enjoyable &amp; entertaining piece of 70's horror/exploitation that works quite well &amp; succeeds at what it tries to achieve, it has the obligatory sleazy cheap look &amp; feel to it which adds to the atmosphere immensely, the script could have been a little better paced but I thought The Toolbox Murders was a great way to spend 90 odd minutes of my time. I just wish the filmmakers didn't include so much bad country music on the soundtrack! There is some good gore here with a woman being killed with a drill, one has a hammer whacked into the top of her head, someone is stabbed with a screwdriver &amp; the famous nail-gun murder along with someone being doused in petrol &amp; being set on fire &amp; a stabbing, all of these scenes are drawn out, bloody &amp; pretty brutal looking. The acting is as good as you can expect from this sort of thing, it ain't too bad but it ain't going to win anyone an Oscar anytime soon. Oh, check the funny bit out when the psycho puts his ski-mask on early on in the film, he can't even put it on straight! Surely it's not that difficult to put a ski-mask on properly?Overall The Toolbox Murders is one of those films you need to have a certain disposition to appreciate, it definitely isn't for everyone but if your interested in low budget horror, gore or exploitation then you could do a lot worse than The Toolbox Murders, a lot worse. I liked it &amp; think it's well worth a watch for those with the stomach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible, but true-to-life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cameron Mitchell stars as Vance Kingsley, the owner of an apartment building who kills "sinful" women (using assorted tools, of course) who commit "unatural acts." He then kidnaps a teenaged girl (Pamelyn Ferdin, who's wonderful) to replace his own deceased daughter.What a mess! The character motivations are muddled and the plot is inconsistent in the extreme. Vance claims that he's a "humane and compassionate" killer because he killed the women as quickly as he could to avoid suffering. But during the murder sequences, he clearly takes his time and seems undisturbed by his actions as they scream in agonizing pain (who wrote this?). But this is probably what makes the film so compelling to watch, as well. We've all heard of murders that seem to have had no logical motive and killers who claim that they are doing the work of God by murdering "sinful" people (while they themselves have commited the ultimate sin by killing). All of Vance's inconsistencies are true-to-life; many killers kill because they are simply crazy. And because of this, THE TOOLBOX MURDERS is more than just a bad film, it's a realistic one (but probably by accident).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely horrible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really was excited about seeing this when I finally got a hold of it. I had heard some good things about this. Who knew how bad this could be...The beginning of the movie for--I don't know how long, has a guy killing four women. The scenes are weak and slow and suspenseless and literally terrible. Then this guy kidnaps some girl (who isn't the worst actress ever, but at points she acted like a mannican) and her mother and brother go on the search for her, with the help of a detective and the girl's boyfriend. (Who actually turns out to be...well...you'll see. The killer also has a "surprise" identity, I think, that was delivered horribly.)Basically, this movie is terrible. It really is. The only semi-redeemable part was the last minute, I'd say, which was okay. Sort of twisted. This whole film really stinks. It's way too chatty, and any scene that could be made tense is just flubbed up. And on the Blockbuster box that this movie came in, it said on the back, "Stephen King has said this is 'One of the ten best horror movies on video.' I don't know what he was on when he made that comment. But then again, he had movies such as Graveyard Shift out that were just as bad.Anyhoo, pass on this. It really is no good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Video Nasty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A ski-masked maniac kills apartment complex tenants with the contents of a toolbox.Blue Underground does a great job of bringing forgotten movies to the mainstream, and making them look good in the process. You might think a "video nasty" from the 1970s would not fare well today, but they make it work with a great audio commentary and interview. We get an inside look at a slasher that really predated the slasher movement.One can see why it got the title of "video nasty". There is a sexuality to it that is not necessarily appropriate, and then the idea of killing people with power tools? This similar idea was explored more humorously with "Slumber Party Massacre", but there is little humor here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is kinda supposed to be some sort of exploitation classic. It has murders, nudity etc etc. Unfortunately there is not much nudity and the gore is absolutely lame. There is not plot at all and the camera is really very very bad. The soundtrack is horrifying because it is so so lame. I mean "elevator class music" lame. It makes the suffering of watching almost unbearable.The only thing I have found interesting is the fact the women to be killed seem to never try to fight or scream or run. They are not characters, they are there just to be killed.I do not consider this movie to be horror or thriller. It is probably very weird attempt to make bloody softcore porn or something. Whats worse - it is incredibly boring. Having said that: I never made it to the end of the movie. It was too lame and boring to waste time on this amateurish attempt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exactly what the title of the movie promises. Loses its attraction towards end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie starts with a very promising rate of about one murder per five minutes. As the title says contents of a toolbox is used for the work and outcome is almost a spoof. Reactions of victims are somewhat wooden. In one scene a drill is used to make a hole to a door much same way as in "Shining" (where an axe is used). "Shining" was released couple years later. Ski mask of the murderer creates interesting face expressions for otherwise silent character in the opening sequence.However after this rather dynamic start the movie loses much of its "attraction". Acting is thoroughly bland. No actor stands out. Wesley Eure (known for "Days of Our Lives") is maybe the best that this movie has to offer. Towards end the movie goes more and more uninteresting. There is an explanation to the motives of murderer - quite pointless in this kind of movie.Music creates interesting contrasts especially in the opening sequence.Not the best of its genre but I would say worth seeing if you like weird horror. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly tedious horror with an effective opening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a small apartment complex that contains an alarming amount of beautiful women living on their own, a masked killer stalks carrying a toolbox full of weapons. Women are butchered with a hammer, a nail-gun, and a power-drill in a short period of time, and Detective Jamison (Tim Donnelly) is assigned to investigate. The killer, Vance (Cameron Mitchell), also kidnaps Laurie Ballard (Pamelyn Ferdin), a 15 year-old girl who bears an uncanny resemblance to his dead teenage daughter. With the inept Jamison refusing to believe it's kidnapping, Laurie's brother Joey (Nicolas Beauvy) starts to investigate the disappearance along with Vance's nephew Kent (Wesley Eure).Traditional gore-hounds tend to turn their noses up at this movie, as after the extremely bloody opening half an hour, the film grinds to a halt and spends time developing it's somewhat tedious plot and characters. But the opening murders are very well done, with Donnelly taking time to develop the set-pieces, and they're usually played out with crooning music in the background that works well as a contradiction to the bloodshed. The killer isn't an unseen madman that seems to have supernatural powers of movement which is usually the norm in slasher flicks, but he is clumsy and awkward, bumbling his way around the room with a lop-sided ski mask, which makes him all the more real.Another plus point is the performance of Cameron Mitchell. Like so many veterans of 1950's and 60's Hollywood, Mitchell ventured into European horror and TV in the 70's and 80's, as his old-fashioned style of acting didn't suit mainstream Hollywood, yet added the required gravitas to many a low-budget horror. His obsession with Laurie forms the most interesting aspect about the film, but it is criminally underdeveloped, and is resigned to just one extended scene. It spends far too much time focusing on the rather crap detective skills of her brother Joey, and his homoerotic relationship with Kent. I'm all for a horror film to slow down and take time to develop its characters, but they're executed with such an alarming blandness that the film becomes simply boring. But the film is well worth a look for a strong opening and Mitchell's performance, if not for just sight of the red-headed victim, who is one of the most stunning victims I've ever seen in horror (long live misogyny!).www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good first half lack luster second half</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Toolbox Murders is one of those early pre date slashers that came out even before Halloween and has become well known among slasher fans due to it's entry on the Video Nasty list back in the 1980's, This is a film that I have seen many times, I dunno why I've never reviewed this movie before, no reason just never got round to it."The Toolbox Murders" starts out with a bang, as we get too see various sexy looking women getting murdered in an apartment building, (dunno why people still live there why don't they just move) not that it's a bad thing, just adds extra cheesiness. Hammers and Nail Guns are the weapons of choice favoured by a convincing menacing serial killer, nothing to complain about there and we even get a likable final girl who is quickly menaced by the killer early on and even kidnapped leaving her brother to try and find her and solve the murders. An interesting subplot even.But then this movie takes a sudden dramatic turn, everything that is shown in the first half of this movie, namely the murders, is almost abandoned in the second half, when the killer is revealed and kidnaps the female lead and has her tied to the bed. It's at this point where the movie quickly becomes rather tame and all the fun of the first half has been sucked out here. Okay like I said before we do get a rather interesting sub plot involving her brother attempting to solve what's going on but that's over way too quickly in a rather unsettling twist. Okay I do like the fact that they have attempted to do something different rather than the usual stalk and slash fest, but in my opinion it does feel rather out of place when it comes to the second half of this movie and even when they do try to flesh out some of these characters it's just not enough development in my opinion. And when it comes to the final moments of this film it does kind of fall flat as it tries to be shocking, which does work in a way.The performances in this movie are quite strong especially from veteran actor Cameron Mitchell who gives a chilling yet convincing performance that's rather menacing and yet quite engaging. Pamela Ferdin who plays Laurie is very sweet and convincing.All in all "Toolbox Murders" is a decent enough entry, with an awesome first half just try not to be put off with the second half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, it's '70's horror so it still has plenty of redeeming qualities.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by no means a classic genre movie but for a low budget independent '70's horror movie it also certainly is one fine watchable movie.Biggest problem with this movie is that there is no main character. Basically for the first third of the movie you only see different murders occur. You just keep waiting for the movie to introduce its main 'hero'. Some times character's roles become bigger in the movie and you expect the rest of the movie to be focused entirely around them but every time then the movie cuts away again and takes a whole other direction with its story and characters. So not really the most consistent movie around.It's an '70's movie, so the movie uses lots of unusual experimental editing. It's fine looking but yet it doesn't all quite work out well enough. The movie uses the proper right required horror build up for its sequences but yet when it comes down to its most important part; the scare moments, the movie falls short. The movie just never knows to become truly tense and perhaps you can even call the movie a bit boring in parts. This is also due to some of the pacing problems of the movie. The fact that we get to know who the killer is pretty early on in the movie (the hairy arms gave it away) also takes away a lot of the tension and mystery atmosphere of the movie.Even though the movie gets gory in parts, I mean the murders are being committed with the contents of a toolbox, how can it not be gory but it's just never really shocking.Still fans of this sub-genre will probably most likely still enjoy and appreciate this movie.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

Only the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre tops this one in the degree of blood and terror. Even though the acting, cinematography and screen play obviously sucked, there's NOTHING like a good gore filled movie from the 1970's.

		<shortDescription>The Toolbox Murders</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sick puppy from director Dennis Donnelly concerning how the car wreck demise of a young woman named Kathy causes her father and cousin to commit unspeakable acts towards innocent human beings. The father, Vance(Cameron Mitchell)is a simply deranged owner of the apartment complex for which he murders a set of beautiful tenants who represent "sinners" needed ridding of so that the world could be a better place. Laurie(Pamelyn Ferdin)shares an apartment with her mother, Jo Ann(Aneta Corsaut) and brother, Joey(Nicolas Beauvy)and Vance kidnaps her, holding the poor girl captive in his suburban home, commissioning his nephew Kent(Wesley Eure, of "Land of the Lost" fame!)to clean up his bloody messes! The police are baffled at the murders wondering just how the killer could operate so freely in dispatching them, moving within their rooms with only one forced entry. Joey, motivated by his sister's disappearance, opts to work as an amateur sleuth as he sees that Detective Jamison(Tim Donnelly)and the police have little to go on. Thanks to Kent, who seems to know more than he lets on(..while also displaying strange behavior when Joey speaks about the acts of violence and his calm demeanor around the crime scenes of the victims' rooms he's about to clean up), Joey suspects Vance once entering the sicko uncle's garage, finding the infamous toolbox, containing the devices used on those women during the nightly murder spree. But, Joey will not suspect someone else..Kent's not exactly operating with a full deck, either! We watch as frightened, and subdued, Laurie, tied to a bed frame, attempts futilely to coerce Vance into letting her go as he drifts into his own fantasies even believing she is his daughter incarnate. Kent, also, finds himself lost to the memories of Kathy, a kissing cousin with a history he is all too willing to share with good ole Uncle Vance, with shocking results.The film doesn't really create an air of mystery as to who committed the grisly, bloody murders at the beginning of the movie, and the reasons for doing so. The director opens inside the front seat showing gloved hands driving a car past the location of where a woman died as a result of a car crash. We then are *treated* to a series of murders(..perhaps not as notorious because of how the director pulls away the camera before the weapons really do their damage, but still repulsive acts of violence) with an assortment of weapons raging from a spinning drill driven into the back of an alcoholic who knows him and is surprised at his antics, a hammer slammed into the back of a victim's head after knocking her unconscious, a screwdriver stabbed into the stomach of a victim who stumbles upon the killer before he could leave, and a nail gun to the head of a model after her lengthly bath tub masturbation sequence. Unlike a lot of giallo thrillers and slashers(..which would follow a similar model as this film), the investigation of the murders is the weakest aspect of the film. The director instead, after bludgeoning the viewer with that wallop of a crime spree, decides to take us into the insanity of Vance, with actor Mitchell, a veteran from the old school Hollywood working in films like this for the money because of problems in his life, sucking a lollipop the first time we see him bringing din-din to Laurie. Mitchell just lets it hang out as the wacko holding so tight to the memory of his little girl and going on and on about the wicked sinners of the world with how he must cut them out like the Bible says. Eure, with those pretty boy looks and squeaky-clean image actually surprised me because he was such an innocent teenage idol on the LotL show. I could see how Joey would be startled at the true maniac that lies behind what appears to be just an ordinary young man looking for some extra dough handed out by Uncle Vance. Beauvy as Joey didn't really impress me, he's merely a plot device who makes a grave discovery whose fate is particularly memorable. Ferdin is a virginal sweetheart mostly tied to the bed hurting from the tightened bondage and worried for her life, a fawn trapped in the madness of a crazed predator(s). What I found most effective was the use of country music playing as Vance murders his victims, and the way the killer carries out his acts so cold-bloodedly, with calculated precision. This will certainly be unpleasant for the weak-hearted and easily offended.</fullReview>

Answer: Because they were women and even in the 70s, women were considered brainless. Why didn't some of them just pick up something and throw it at him and then kick the crap out of him? Answer: Because in those days women were still considered weak and damsels in distress and still needed a strong empty-headed man around to "save" them. Why is it that for absolutely no reason at all, their shirts would suddenly fly open for no apparent reason? Answer: Because it was the 70s. Why were the women described as "exhibitionist?" Answer: Because if you didn't know already, all women are that way, right ladies. God knows that's what I like to do in my spare time (sarcastic of course.) I found myself screaming at the TV for the women "throw the lamp at him!" since they just stood their screaming when he was clearly at least 10 feet from them. It is just your typical low budget B horror movie full of butts, boobs, brainless, bubble headed bimbos from the Planet Playtex. I doubt very seriously if the female actors in it really wanted to do some of the stuff in this movie, but hey, I understand, a paycheck is a paycheck and they may get noticed to do something substantial.But for the most part, this movie was the antithesis of all the dumb low budget B horror movies of the 1970s and even some of the 1980s. Although some of the acting was actually descent, the story line itself was choppy of ridicules and down right stupid and stigmatized women as being weak and stupid.My condolences to the female actors in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>promising start, but falls apart quickly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening scene, in which an unseen assailant drives around, listening to some fundamentalist idiot spouting off about the world's 'evil' on the radio, you almost know where "The Toolbox Murders" is headed. Unfortunately, after several effective, gruesome deaths (which all take place in the first 15 minutes of the film), the movie becomes another one of those "God-made-me-do-it" cheese-fests, where the killer justifies his madness by citing his strict religious upbringing (which might be THE most tired cliche in the Mad Slasher Handbook). The film is redeemed by the crude innovation of the murders, the long "bathtub" scene, and some funny bad acting by a cast of nobodies. Timothy Donnelly ("Parts: The Clonus Horror") is hilarious as a would-be tough-guy police detective, and Aneta Corseaut (Steve McQueen's girlfriend in "The Blob"!) seems embarrassed beyond belief as the mother of one of the victims. Don't go out of your way to see "The Toolbox Murders" unless you're a slasher enthusiast. 1.5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trash.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film apparently caused quite some controversy when it was released back in 1978, and it's easy to see why - the "bathtub" scene is explicit even by today's standards, and I'll bet that it's cut (or shortened) from the current British re-release of the film. Essentially, however, this is an artlessly made (there's no style to the killings, although the weapons used - like a nail-gun and a screwdriver - are fairly original), rampantly misogynistic horror film with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Cameron Mitchell, as the lollipop-sucking, Bible-quoting owner of the building where the murders take place, is beyond awful, but the screenwriter is also to blame for giving him campy lines like "Come here, you damn fornicator!"

		<shortDescription>Dull, cheap &amp; silly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film begins with a masked man carrying a toolbox around an apartment block. He murders four women by using a drill, a hammer, a chisel and a nail gun. Not one word is spoken during the first 15 minutes of the film. The man then kidnaps a woman who is related to him. Then the cops arrive, and as usual in films of this type, they are completely useless. So the kidnapped woman's inept boyfriend decides to investigate. All very silly. It's a wonder Cameron Mitchell managed to keep a straight face through the scenes when he's talking like a child to the kidnapped woman. Also, after the initial four murders, there is hardly any other violence in the film. It becomes dull very quickly. This is Dennis Donnelly's only theatrical feature film. I wonder why?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Toolbox Murders, The (1978) * 1/2 (out of 4) Notorious slasher was highly controversial when first released and while the film starts off good it quickly falls apart. A man wearing a ski mask is using items out of his toolbox to brutally murder women in an apartment complex. This film is highly talked about amongst horror fans due to the creative death scenes but for me the film is a major disappointment because of the sudden change in tempo after the half hour mark. The opening twenty-minutes contain one murder right after the other and the creative kills mixed in with the slow pacing of the murders really builds a strange atmosphere that works quite well. Sadly, after these sequences the film tries to become a Hitchcock like mystery but the screenplay isn't strong enough to keep the film moving and it quickly falls flat on its face. I'm really not sure why the filmmakers, clearing making an exploitation film, would deliver the goods so quickly and then turn their back on them and try to deliver something smart. The film is certainly worth watching due to the death scenes, which involve hammers, screwdrivers and various other objects but the highlight of the film is the infamous scene where a woman in masturbating in the bath when the killer breaks in with a nailgun. Cameron Mitchell is on hand to cash a paycheck and delivers a pretty bad performance, although I guess alcohol could be involved. The rest of the cast members are all pretty bland but they're no worse than what you'd expect in a film like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If only the murderer had more tools...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't like slashers where the murderer only uses one murder weapon, so the premise behind The Toolbox Murders sounded great to me - a psychopath with a whole box full of weapons to do his slicing and dicing with! The opening sequence, which sees a young woman butchered with a drill, gives way to an even better scene where we watch a hot naked chick killed with a nail gun. But for some reason, the film doesn't follow these scenes up with anything similar in quality, and after the good opening; The Toolbox Murders becomes rather routine. The plot is supposedly based on a true story, which sort of makes the sickness more potent and benefits from a nice gritty atmosphere emanating from the block of apartments that make up the central location. The plot follows a butch man with a toolbox full of goodies who, for some reason, decides to use them for things other than DIY. When a young man's sister is kidnapped, he decides to track her down himself and after being asked for advice by the police(?), we get treated to the discovery of the identity of the not so helpful repair man.Considering the huge amount of potential this had to be one of the truly great slasher films, The Toolbox Murders is a huge letdown. Our killer has a nail gun and a drill in his toolbox, but that's about it. I was highly disappointed to find that a chainsaw wasn't present and the death scenes we do have, while shocking and gory, aren't what they could have been. The film was, rather unsurprisingly, banned during the eighties as a part of the DPP's "Video Nasty" list, and really that's the only reason to bother viewing it. Tobe Hooper remade this film in 2003, and while I didn't like the remake much; it is superior to this movie. The atmosphere is rather nice, as the cheap feel of the movie translates into a gritty and depressing feel that bodes well with the murders. However, the killer's motives are never really explained; and the central idea of the kidnapped girl doesn't make a lot of sense. The murderer himself is suitably sick, but it's hard to believe that this guy would take it upon himself to begin butchering people with his array of tools. Naturally, the acting is rather crappy and overall, while The Toolbox Murders has its moments; I can't say that I'm glad I saw it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Repulsive massacres and nothing else. Screw political correctness!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film once made the notorious list of Britain's forbidden movies and since I'm personally intrigued by that kind of garbage, I had to watch it sooner or later. It's easy to see why this sickie got so infamous?after only 15 minutes of playtime you're already treated to 3 repulsive massacres and gratuitous nudity (including a long and pointless female masturbation scene in a bathtub). No depth, no building up an atmosphere, not even a word of possible motives?just bloody butchering! Lovely! In case it's not clear yet: this is a slasher movie from the era where everything was possible. The makers didn't have to worry about ethical situations or whether their product was politically correct or not. All that matters is a grizzly portrayal of bad taste and explicitly showing the largest possible body count. And I'll shamelessly admit that it works, too. This is one fun flick and, if you watch the fully uncut version, one of the bloodiest gems ever unleashed upon horror loving audiences. The Toolbox Murders is half creative and half imbecile. The idea of a killer using tools (nail gun, hammers and drills) is fairly imaginative but after a while the no-substance plot really begins to irritate you and some of the absurd plot-twists are too ridiculous for words. And I should mention the totally inappropriate use of music! Golden oldies, like country songs by Dolly Parton, are very over-the-top and completely misfit. The identity of the killer doesn't really come as a surprise since you didn't care enough to find out. And yes, you forgive him his ridicule motives for killing just because he does it so swell.Even though this is far from being a horror masterpiece, director Tobe Hooper found the premise interesting enough to produce a remake in 2003. The setting of that film is entirely different but the killer's nasty modus operandi is repeated. Never change a winning team, I guess?.especially not if it is a gory as this one!</fullReview>
