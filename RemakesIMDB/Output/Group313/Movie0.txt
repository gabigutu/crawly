		<shortDescription>This movie is a real treat!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is obvious that this movie was designed and photographed by true artists. Art Director Cedric Gibbons has been credited with over 1,000 movies throughout his career spanning the 20s - 50s. Associate Art Director Edwin Willis has also designed over 500 sets.Every corner of every scene has interesting and beautiful details to look at in the sets of the English cottage and gardens, and all are exquisitely lit and photographed by cinematographer Ray June. Pay attention to the way he uses light streaming in the windows and highlights even the smallest details. It is striking.Rosalind Russell also gives a very good English accent. I liked her serene performance of a prim Englishwoman. Robert Montgomery excellently portrays the "dangerous type," a psychopath who can display many different personalities to suit his needs. I especially liked his performance in the arrest scene. Dame May Whitty also gives an excellent performance as the abrasive but gullible and neurotic Mrs. Bramson.A good movie doesn't have to have a lot of action and chase scenes. I recommend this movie for many other reasons: Beautiful sets, lighting, photography, interesting story, interesting dialogue, and interesting characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whitty walks away with this "poetic" thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other commentators have complained about the "talkiness" of this thriller, and it can't be denied that much of the movie's almost-two-hour running time is squandered in the Welsh equivalent of blarney. (Thank original author Emlyn Williams, and remember this was originally a stage play -- in fact, I've seen it on stage, where it may work even better, with its more obvious and mannered mechanisms). You won't find a cast this good at a Wednesday matinee, however. Roz Russell, in plain-Jane getups, plays a definite third wheel to Robert Montgomery's charming psycho and Dame May Whitty's steely but dependent old battleaxe. Whitty walks away with the movie even though wheelchair-bound; she's amusingly annoying and in almost every scene, but at the end, when panic strikes her and she skitters off into hysteria, she shows what a great old trouper she was -- almost the British version of Marie Dressler. If you aren't totally spoiled by the whiplash pacing of today's movies, Night Must Fall still packs a special thrill for lovers of literate, well-acted melodrama. Just be a wee bit patient.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic mystery thriller is a bit creaky, but still worthwhile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Emlyn Williams suspenseful stage play is given a strong treatment in this atmospheric film. Russell plays the penniless and somewhat dowdy niece of crotchety, cranky Witty, a wealthy, feisty old woman confined to a wheelchair (possibly by her own hypochondria!) When one of the maids of the house is made pregnant, Witty interviews the guilty party (Montgomery) in order to scold him and pressure him into marrying the wayward girl, but instead is charmed to the point of hiring him on as an assistant and care-giver to herself. Russell watches in disbelief and disgust as this snake weasels his way into the heart of the otherwise cantankerous Witty and eventually begins to believe that his cheerful demeanor is a cover for a much darker side. The fact that a beheaded woman's body was found nearby and that he keeps a hat box that is "much too heavy for a hat" only adds to her fears and suspicions, yet she is strangely drawn to him, falling under his spell herself, with only occasional breaks back into cold reality. Russell and Montgomery play a game of mental tennis with Witty as the ball until the situation reaches a fever pitch. Russell does well in a mostly understated portrayal. Her versatility is evident as only two years later she would soar overboard in the classic "The Women". Sometimes, her character's motivations are fuzzy, but she does an able job of standing up to and being drawn to Montgomery. Montgomery is excellent. His innate pleasantness and sunny face mask a truly troubled persona that only comes to the surface occasionally. His interplay with both women, but primarily Witty, is a highlight of the film. Incidentally, in certain scenes and in some long shots, he resembles Jude Law (even on the video cover.) Witty is magnificent in her role as the bitter, lonely old woman whose ice is melted by the new surrogate son in her life. Alternately snippy and delighted, she and Montgomery have great chemistry and are a memorable screen duo. The remainder of the cast is solid and helpful to the ambiance with the possible exception of Russell's rather gooey love interest Marshal (though there isn't much he could have done with that part.) Definitely showing its age and its stage roots, (and clocking in a bit too lengthily) the film is nonetheless entertaining and intriguing for the most part. Interestingly, Montgomery's career as a leading man was not affected by this dark role, yet a couple of years later Cary Grant was prevented from playing one that was far less deranged in "Suspicion" (thus rendering that film's storyline somewhat ridiculous.) Montgomery even scored an Oscar nomination. It's interesting to wonder whether Grant could have gotten one if his character weren't toyed with and how his career path may have changed if he had played the darker aspects (but he could hardly complain about his film success!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Montgomery's great performance illuminates film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this movie I had never heard of Robert Montgomery. After seeing it, he instantly joined Robert Mitchum, Lee Marvin, Gene Kelly, Lon Chaney (Sr), and Beverly Garland on the short list of actors whose movies i will watch simply because they are in them. I recently also found out about R. Montgomery's work as a director, which I look forward to seeing as soon as TCM airs some of it. Now to the movie, I've only seen it once, so I don't know how qualified I am to speak on it, but I do know that Robert Montgomery's performance as a psychotic killer is one of the all time greats in the category, certainly the equal in its sinister qualities to the better performances along these lines of actors like Lon Chaney, Robert Ryan, and Anthony Hopkins. This movie should be watched and I guarantee you will be surprised it is like no other film of the 30s and like no other film since. It is full of cheezy melodramatic moments but also has some really chilling moments of fear. Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Psychology in this Intriguing Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never heard of this movie. I watched it the other night on Turner Movie Classics.Robert Montgomery is amazing in this role. His subtle English accent reminded me of Paul McCartney. He is totally immersed in this role.Rosalind Russell is not that impressive until about the middle of the movie.Her unwilling attraction to Babyface finally makes sense.The other great performance was by Dame May Witty. She fell hook, line, and sinker for Babyface.Had Babyface not been so self-destructive and amoral probably Mrs. Bramson would have left him her entire estate.I strongly recommend this movie. It is beautifully filmed, directed, and acted. It is one of those movies made in the 30s that is surprisingly better than many of today's movies, and much more intrinsic in its twists and turns. All of the characters are defined and varied.This could give Hitchcock a run for his money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all-time favorites (contains spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As you can see from my ID name, this is one of my top 10 movies of all time. Yes, it is basically a filmed stage play, not really opened out, but the performances of the 3 leads are so magnificent, it doesn't really matter.Dame May Whitty plays a woman you love to hate very well in this one. Mrs. Bramson, her character, is so nasty, smug and self-satisfied, that you can't help but cheer when Bob Montgomery's Danny smothers her ? good show! My friend and I laughed our heads off when she went into hysteria when left alone and had to drag her butt off the wheelchair and actually stand up on her own. A very good performance. I have seen her in several other films, but in smaller and less showy roles than here, and I think she carried it off beautifully? and she was 72 at the time. WOW! -- Impressive!What can I say about Robert Montgomery's performance, except that I thought it was fantastic, and such a large step away from many of his roles, especially up to that point. Apparently the studio was mad at him for defying some rule, or whatever, and gave him this role as punishment. Well, he showed them. Aside from him being slightly restrained in a couple of earlier scenes (he could have been a bit more menacing, although I suppose the objective was to build the suspense at a slower pace), his performance hit fever pitch at the film's end. The arrest scene (my friend's favorite) and the psychotic breakdown speech (my favorite ? the church/evil monologue was great also) were excellent. Who knew the man had it in him? And all the while keeping the spot-on Welsh accent. BRAVO!!!! As good as Montgomery was in comedy, I would love to have seen him in more roles similar to this (as in The Big House and A Rage in Heaven).Rosalind Russell was the perfect choice for the role of Olivia Grayne, Whitty's niece, as we see her blossom from a backward, repressed, shy woman into a more self-assured, no-nonsenser unafraid to speak her mind by the movie's end -- both types of roles that Russell has always been able to pull off with ease.The lengthly scene in the kitchen between Danny and Olivia (the actors make a good pair) is very sexy, yet does not even contain a single kiss. Boy, they knew how to make ?em in the old days!My little quiibbles: the script could have delved a bit more into Danny's psyche, and could also have relied on less conveniently-placed exits/entrances for the characters. But these are minor points.A film not to be missed for the fab performances, esp. Bob Montgomery tossing cats around and menacing old ladies.HIGHLY RECOMMEMDED.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly acted, moody psychological drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Night Must Fall," which was originally a play by Emlyn Williams, contains three fantastic roles for actors, and as a film, it has been beautifully cast, directed (by Richard Thorpe), and photographed. Set in an English cottage in a village that borders a forest, Rosalind Russell lives with her horrid, verbally abusive aunt. Along comes Danny, basically brought into the household to be spoken to about a promised marriage to one of the maids in the house. Danny is a sexual opportunist, a murderer, and a psychopath who can hone in on what each person he meets needs and wants. He soon becomes charmingly indispensable to the aunt. The Russell character senses his black soul but is attracted to him nonetheless, and he knows it. What transpires is an intriguing mystery and psychological drama.Robert Montgomery was a wonderful actor, adept at many kinds of roles but most often cast in the light comedies so often made in the '30s. Here he is fantastic - a charming, frightening liar with a huge ego who thinks his crafty mind will win in the end. Russell gives a beautiful, underplayed performance as an unhappy young woman, dating a man she's not sure she loves, attracted to this stranger and to the possibility of something interesting happening to her. Dame May Witty is great as an abrasive shrew.This is one of those gems - and doesn't Hollywood know it, they've remade it enough - but it's a real tour de force for the right actors. A winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Epitome of an Intelligent Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A marvelous suspenseful, tension-filled, atmospheric thriller with absolutely NO "blood and guts," and I thank God for that. This film is intelligent in every respect and requires the viewer to watch with his/her brain switched "ON." "Night Must Fall" is the epitome of an intelligent horror film.The first time I saw this film I was initially and completely mesmerized by Robert Montgomery's performance. I had not seen him act in any film other than gay '30's farces (with some serious roles thrown into the mix) or WW II films. I always enjoyed his films, but after seeing "Night Must Fall" I began to pay attention to his acting in other films and developed a greater appreciation for his skill as an actor.Rosalind Russell is a talented, gorgeous actor/wit/comedienne, and is able to fully-utilize her skill in her role. What can I say about Dame May Witty, other than I wish I could travel back in time to see her on the stage in London in her prime. The two other women characters in the home, the cook and the girlfriend/servant, are small but vital roles that each actor plays to perfection. Additionally, this was that unusual and rare film that was adapted from a stage play BUT was not merely shot as a play. Unless you paid attention to the credits, you would not realize this was a stage play. Not so easy to adapt a stage play to film, keep the dialog flowing properly, turning the play into a film that is meant to be seen as a film.This film is perfectly written, directed and acted. The lighting and cinematography are superb. The set designs, costumes, etc...............all nonpareil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it Bigger Than a Hat box?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhat forgotten, uniquely entertaining "thriller" about the happenings of an old English cottage when news of a missing then discovered murdered woman surrounds household. Rosialnd Russell, looking very prim and proper(and Oh! so young!), gives a good performance as a bullied niece with loads of imagination, a repressed sexual bent, and some genuine ambivalent feelings toward life, death, and the whole notion of what is exciting and what is dull. She takes orders from the wonderful Dame May Witty giving a grand performance as an imperious woman in a wheelchair trying to clutch on to anything in her life that will still give it meaning. Her household is visited upon by a young man that has been seeing one of the servant girls - Robert Montgomery - and he manages through his "charm" to worm his way into her home. We know at the very beginning that his intentions are not noble as we see him talk about Witty's wealth and spy on her as she locks away her valuables. Witty adopts Montgomery, now working in her home, as a kind soul full of funny anecdotes and good will. Russell knows differently but either is unwilling to accept what kind of person Montgomery is or is excited by that very same kind of person he may be. The murder looms the entire time in the background. Richard Thorpe does one heck of a good job infusing this film with taut tension and gentle humour. His use of setting and cinematography in particular show great craftsmanship. He is also blessed with three strong performing leads. Witty is an absolute treasure. Russell is very good, and Montgomery gives what might be his best performance. His light Cockney-like accent is believable, and although I found his character despicable from the very beginning - that credit for making what many perceived as a charming local initially affable and then later very detestable is a credit to Montgomery's acting craft. He plays a psychopath very well indeed. Night Must Fall will not dazzle you with action sequences, nor will you even see any actual violence. The film is very talky, but wonderfully so and relies almost entirely on the dialog and the believability of the acting. Movies like this sure aren't made any more. They just involve way too much thinking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional morbid comedy/drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Witty reverse morality story of an obnoxious old woman (Whitty) who takes in a lodger/servant to help her (and to spite her live-in niece, Russell, who doesn't know her aunt is leaving her $100 in her rich estate). He's "not an ordinary servant", and neither is she. They have a love story, too, shared in the dark in a time when fear and possibility are the same, and death and sex interchangeable. Thus, Danny (nice, innocent sounding name), left alone with the old woman -- makes his move. Montgomery is stunning and disarming as he shifts from "play acting" as the charming young gent to the possibly psychotic. Russell is also a convincing dark horse, saddled with a lame lover. Great photography, decent directing. This is a should-be legendary suspense film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note: I am unsure as to whether my comments about Mongomery here are a spoiler, so rather than be blacklisted, I submitted it as "spoiler," although one would have to be a bit dense not to see where the film is going.Now to what I gave to say: If you don't think Robert Mongomery can act, see this film. If you do think he can act, see this film. This is very close to being a classic, low key thriller with even an unusual twist about the dark side of one of the "upright" characters thrown in as highly believable depiction of the complex nature of the psyche. The other members of the cast, Rosalind and the rest, are just great. It seems to be in the Hitchock vein and to really outdo the "master," at least in my opinion. For me, this was an entirely different Robert Mongomery than any of the characters I've seen him play. He is simultaneously credibly charming and sinister. And I do mean "credible." He most certainly deserves kudos for his role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful at Times, but Not Entirely Credible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film a couple of times, if only for the sinister, multi-faceted performance of Robert Montgomery (Elizabeth's father), but, as someone previously noted, it is an old play and it certainly creaks from time to time. A horrible crime is committed in a small English town; a local woman has been found dead, her head missing. There are no suspects, and the police are alerted for a maniac roaming the area. Rosalind Russell is a prim, bookish young woman staying with Dame May Witty, her petulant, wheelchair-bound aunt. The aunt makes demands of her niece, and tends to be full of unctuous self-pity. Robert Montgomery appears on the scene as Danny, an Irish dandy who is dating one of the old lady's maids. He soon charms Dame May, who hires him on as her helper and general syncophant - flattering her, and giving in to all her petty whims with a smile and a smooth air. Rosalind Russell does not trust him, and lets her dislike of him show, but there seems to be an undercurrent of attraction to him at the same time. Despite her distrust, she leaves her aunt alone with him to visit her lover in town, and the horribly inevitable occurs. I found several holes in this so-called "thriller". One is: if she did not trust him, and wondered about his past, and noted some instability in his personality -- why leave a defenseless old lady alone with him? Why were the police not more suspicious of a newcomer in town, and not more strident in their investigation of him? And, a most unpleasant truth, if indeed he had that missing body part in the infamous hatbox, why didn't the scent of decay (let's be realistic here) permeate that small cottage? That alone would have sent him to the gallows much sooner, as it would have been immediately noticed. So there was a little too much dramatic license here. If you've seen the later remake with Albert Finney - another fine actor who also imbued Danny's character with a very sinister psychosis - you'll find the same stretches of credibility here that detracted from the finale of this drama. It's good watching for the fine character actors in the cast, but not something that I'd think would scare the tar out of you if you examine it closely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining, if not too logical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: spoilers follow.Let's see if I've got this straight. A neighboring woman disappears and her hidden body is later found with the head severed. About the same time, an itinerant young man shows up, charms the crotchety old lady who runs the household, as well as most of her staff, with the sole exception of her dedicated personal assistant, who is also her niece and who can't stand her. The niece immediately becomes suspicious, does some checking, and finds out that his background isn't exactly what he says it is. Meanwhile she discovers he's carrying around a hatbox which she, and we, suspect contains the severed. So do the police, but when the police ask him to open the hatbox, the niece comes to his rescue and gets him off the hook by saying that the box is hers and that it contains some papers. Why does she rescue him? Could it be that she is secretly attracted to him? If so, this is belied by the all of her previous (and subsequent)actions, all of which indicate that she is terrified of him. And with good reason, as it turns out, because he soon dispatches the old lady. We never see her body, because he probably hid it as well, since he seems absolutely certain that he'll never be caught. Then the police show up, following a tip from the niece's boyfriend that couldn't have been more than conjecture. He is arrested and resigns himself to eventually being hanged, but it's never clear what he is being arrested for, the first murder or the second. And on what evidence? There is nothing linking him to the old lady's death, and there's no indication that they saw what was in the hatbox. So, go figure!All this probably makes the film sound much worse than it actually is, because in spite of all the aforementioned, I still recommend it. It is tremendously entertaining and contains some superb acting. Although this was early in Montgomery's career, this was easily his best performance. Dame May Whitty is superb as well. Rosalind Russell underplays her role. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit creaky, like an old wheelchair, but still well worth watching?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Olivia Grayne (Rosalind Russell), a prim-looking, bespectacled young woman in tweed skirts, twinsets, and sensible shoes, lives in a country house with her crabby aunt Mrs. Bramson (Dame May Witty) and suffers the indignity of being treated like a servant while employed as her aunt's companion. She is ardently pursued by her aunt's lawyer Justin Laurie (Alan Marshal, a ringer for Laurence Olivier), who is handsome and good. Frankly, I would have left with him long ago. He asks her to marry him and says, "Even if you don't love me, aren't I better than the old lady?" Indeed!! Olivia longs for some adventure or excitement in her life of drab monotony, but doesn't think it's ever going to happen.That changes when Dora, one of the maids, confesses tearfully to being "in trouble" by a messenger from another house. Mrs. Bramson agrees to see him to make him do right by the girl. Into their lives comes Danny (Robert Montgomery), a strutting Irish charmer whose silver tongue so enchants the old lady, she offers him a job. He nonchalantly agrees to marry the maid, like many sociopaths who toss off the answer they know needs to be said without any intention of actually doing so. Indeed, soon enough Danny is taking dinner with the ladies of the house and being served by the maid presumably carrying his baby.Olivia sees right through Danny from the start. She becomes interested in him, though, because he's good-looking, different, and has that dangerous bad-boy vibe going on. But she's also repulsed my his servile attitude to the old cantankerous battle-axe and his facile way with the truth. Nonetheless, after he tells her she would be prettier "without them glasses on," we don't see her wearing them much.When the lady of the house from his previous employment turns up dead, nude, and decapitated in the woods, Danny seems to know her far too intimately to have been just her servant. Olivia twigs onto this immediately, and has her suspicions. Olivia wonders what is in the hatbox under the bed that is much too heavy for a hat and why he's never unpacked his things. Nonetheless, Olivia saves his bacon when the police inspector wants to look through his things and she claims his hatbox as her own. She feels a little sorry for him and we guess that even she doesn't know quite why she did this.There's a lot of sexual tension between Danny and Olivia. This is played out in quite a charged fashion in the kitchen scene. Olivia goes to make tea because she can't sleep. Danny is also awake, troubled by something. He hears someone in the kitchen, goes to investigate, and scares the bejesus out of Olivia. He pegs her spot on, telling her, "You want adventure, don't you? It's right here in this house, right here in this kitchen, with the two of us, alone here, at this time of night. It's exciting, isn't it?" He tells her, as she is breathing hard and blushing, that she's never been alone with a chap like him but she likes it, and it's a secret part of her she never knew existed. He comes closer to her, close enough to kiss?It's true, she is excited. But it's dangerous too, and she knows it. I won't spoil the scene for you; you'll have to see it for yourself.This was the first performance I had seen Montgomery give. I went back and saw his romantic comedies and then saw this again. He is wonderful in it, and indeed was nominated for an Academy Award. His Irish accent is very good. His demeanor as the insouciant servant who starts out mouthing platitudes to all and sundry and by the end of the story is displaying his contempt of them is very well-played. His good looks worked for him in this role, as who would believe someone so handsome would be a killer? Indeed, would many women have cuddled up with Ted Bundy had he looked creepy and frightening? That's just how sociopaths work; and Montgomery pretty much nails it. Russell is good as well in the kind of role that would be left in the dust as she moved on the screwball comedies in just a few years. Dame May Witty, as the malingering old biddy, is too perfect with her complaints of palpitations, bosom-clutching, and rattling around in a wheelchair she clearly doesn't need. Her hysterics late in the film, when everyone has left her alone and she has the "jitters," is classically comical.The story holds up but some of the film's flaws include staginess and talkiness (over two hours long). You can tell it started life as a play because most of the action takes place in one room from which all others open off. I also found heavy-handed the device of using threatening music when Danny enters the room. Also, mention is made that the body has not been found yet and promptly there is a scream from offstage and a policeman rushes in to use the phone to report that the body has indeed been found. Stagy! It doesn't quite hold up to thriller standards by today's viewpoint but still atmospheric, and the set design is beautiful and the performances, especially Montgomery's, are well worth seeing. In fact, this role was not given to Montgomery as some sort of punishment by MGM, as suggested by another post. Louis B. Mayer was astounded Montgomery wanted to play this type of role at all, and Bob had to fight for it. If all you know of him is the fluffy romantic movies where he waltzed around pretty women and said things like, "I love you, and you love me too, admit it," do see him acting quite differently in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth a Closer Look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following a grisly murder, a pushy stranger worms his way into a rich, old lady's remote household, much to disapproval of her uptight secretary.What a good touch when Danny (Montgomery) roughly shoves the house cat and then smilingly tells Mrs. Bramson (Witty) how much he likes the little four-footed critters?a neat introduction to his devious nature. I wish the rest of the movie were this well executed. Aside from being overlong and too talky as other reviewers point out, (some silent mood scenes are badly needed), there's a big hole in the middle that's been generally overlooked. Surprisingly, it concerns that otherwise excellent actress Rosalind Russell.Key to the plot is the highly refined, severely repressed Olivia's (Russell) conflict over Danny. She's both attracted and repelled by him. He's such a low, boisterous type, it's hard to see her attraction to him at any level. But the script has wisely prepared us with her attraction to dark, woodsy things. Now, the movie's key scene is in the kitchen where Danny boldly confronts Olivia's repressed attraction. To this point, Olivia has had only one outward emotion, namely an emotionless expression consonant with her inner discipline and station in the household. Danny's aim is to force from her an acknowledgment of what he knows she feels even though she won't admit it even to herself.Crucial to this pivotal scene is that actress Russell convey even the slightest expression of the inner conflict she is now experiencing? conflict we know she's experiencing from the dialog. But try as I have, I can't spot a single change of expression. She's grudgingly okaying the words, but without the necessary conflicted behavior. In short, her words say one thing, her manner another. Thus, we're not drawn into her conflict, we merely observe it in the dialog. And crucially-- instead of becoming active participants in the story, we're encouraged to remain passive observers.In terms of story development, the role of Olivia becomes unconvincing, especially since the deadpan continues for the rest of the film. It's especially implausible when the plot has her hide the severed head in order to save Danny from the law. As a result, her motivations from the kitchen scene on ring hollow, thereby undercutting her pivotal role in the movie as a whole. It wouldn't be accurate to say that Russell therefore walks through the part in uninterested fashion. Rather, I'm inclined to blame director Thorpe for not providing the proper cues, especially in that key kitchen scene. At the same time, I wish Montgomery's Danny were not so extreme, bordering at times on the clownish. For a usually restrained actor, it's a real departure, robbing his character of any hint of needed menace. Still and all, the idea of Danny's acting out for the benefit of his "double"? the one that emerges in the mirror scene at the end-- remains a provocative one.Where Danny's blustery, overdone charm really works is with tyrannical old Mrs. Bramson. His is just the kind of overriding personality that would melt her icy reserve. At the same time, Witty steals the film with a rock solid performance, especially during that exhausting breakdown scene that even had me gasping for breath. I also like that morbid sight-seeing tour with E. E. Clive as the guide. That people would pay to see a gravesite suggests to me the basic gentility of small town England for whom murder is such an unusual and curious event. I gather from IMDb that studio head L. B. Mayer didn't like the results and didn't want to release the film. Whatever the failings, It's far from being that bad. Ironically, it appears that had Mayer himself wanted to do justice to the material, he would have assigned a top studio director instead of the thoroughly mediocre Thorpe (check out his credits). In fact, the movie as a whole suffers from uninspired direction, its rich atmospheric potential left visually untapped. As far as I can tell, Thorpe simply filmed the script that was handed him and nothing more. After all, his reputation with the studio rested on efficiency, i.e. bringing projects in under budget.I just wish someone like Hitchcock had gotten hold of the material first. With its rich potential for nuance and atmosphere, a gifted psychologist like Hitch could have made something really memorable. Unfortunately, as the movie stands, it's a long way from that point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Classic Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember my parents telling me how great this film was and the great acting performed by all the actors. It is great to see other generations enjoying this great story that was performed on the New York City stage and then the 1937 film version. Robert Montgomery, (Danny 'Babyface'), "Lady in the Lake",'47, played a rather strange fellow who became quite involved with Rosalind Russell,(Olivia Grayne), "Wonderful Town", '58 who lived with her Aunt, Dame May Witty, (Mrs. Bramson), "The White Cliffs of Dover",'44. Danny was hired by Mrs. Bramson, who was delighted with his great wit and charming personality. This is certainly a very dramatic film which reveals deep hidden secrets about each persons mental feelings and childhood problems that some of them share with each other. Dame May Witty, was the first woman awarded the title of Dame in 1918, which stands for Knight in the United Kingdom. A must see great Classic film of 1937</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Montgomery Finally Shows He Is More Than a Stylish Cad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Montgomery had a distinguished acting career for two decades, which initially was one as weaklings and society cads, but subsequently had meatier roles in store for him. This is not to dismiss his initial performances. He honed a first rate comic timing in these films, so that by the end of the 1930s he was a leading man in many comedies. But except for an occasional film like THE BIG HOUSE (where he is a prisoner who turns stool pigeon) most of his films were set in upper crust society, such as in THE LAST OF MRS. CHEYNEY. But in 1937 he actually got the chance to show he was an actor of the first rank. Due to some problem with the heads of MGM, Montgomery was given the role of "Danny" in NIGHT MUST FALL as punishment. It was history repeating itself. In 1934 to punish Clark Gable MGM hired him out to Columbia Pictures, and he ended up with the male lead in Frank Capra's IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT, and his Oscar performance. In 1937 Montgomery's "Danny" would earn him the Oscar nomination for best actor, but he lost to Spencer Tracy (who MGM pushed for the Oscar). However, after 1937 Montgomery had a better selection of different roles in his career.NIGHT MUST FALL was a play about a small household in an English village, made up of Mrs. Bramson (Dame May Witty), her niece/secretary/punching bag Olivia (Roselind Russell), Emily the Cook (Kathleen Harrison), and Dora the Maid (Merle Tottingham). Dora has been romancing a hotel busboy/waiter named Danny (Montgomery), and he is brought to the cottage to meet Mrs. Bramson to ask for her approval of the marriage of Dora and Danny. But Danny is a charmer who knows how to manipulate Mrs. Bramson. The sharp tongued and harsh old lady finds herself liking the young man, and he is hired to work in the cottage.It's just as well for Danny. One of the female guests at the hotel has disappeared. The viewers are aware (at the start) of some figure burying the body in the woods, but we are not fully certain who. Danny continues charming Mrs. Bramson, Dora, and (to a lesser degree)Emily. But Olivia is not quite so unquestioning. She finds him too conceited, and not very trustworthy regarding whatever he says. Dora and Emily are also aware of this (Dora wondering what happened to the marriage plans she and Danny had been discussing). Instead Danny concentrates his charm and line of blarney (although he is Welsh, not Irish) on the difficult Mrs. Branson. He may have ulterior reasons - he sees where Branson keeps her household expense money in a desk, while peeking through a window. The audience is aware that Olivia is right in not trusting the young man.Olivia can't make her aunt see what she sees - Branson is all toughness with Olivia, but not with Danny. Olivia does discuss the matter with her boyfriend Justin Laurie (Alan Marshall) but even he (being a solicitor) is not fully convinced that Danny is anything but harmless. There is no real evidence. Then Olivia (with Dora and Emily) does a little spying. They go through Danny's belongings, and find his wallet shows he's had other romances, and he has a photo of himself and the missing woman. But before they can check a mysterious large hat-box Danny brought with him, he silently enters the room and confronts them.The film has an excellent atmosphere due to it's concentration (except in a handful of scenes) on the rooms of the cottage. Also on the three leads. Witty is wonderful as an apparently wheelchair bound old woman who has little warmth in her toward her niece (we later learn she hated Olivia's mother), and is only interested in her own comfort. Russell plays Olivia as nearly neurotic - used to being her aunt's servant and punching bag, yet civil and trying to be of use and of warning the old lady. And Montgomery's Danny, cigarette dangling insolently from his lip (or behind his ear when not lit), ready to give a line of blarney to amuse the elderly Bramson. Yet he also, gradually, opens up bit by bit to the fascinated Olivia - until the pressures of what he reveals frightens the hell out of her.Finally the body of the missing woman turns up in the forest. But it is mutilated (no head is found, and the killer tried to remove the fingerprints). Olivia is now wondering about that hat-box. She is sure she knows who is the murderer. But can she make her aunt see it?I'll leave it there. To me it remains a flawless study of criminal evil, with Montgomery (in the last half hour) revealing what such a criminal's mind is like. Emlyn Williams (who wrote the play) was fascinated by true crime - he would write a memoir about the Ian Brady-Myra Hindley "Moor Murders" Case of the 1960s, BEYOND BELIEF. The American Criminal Historian Albert Borowitz wrote an essay on the play suggesting that Danny is based on the Crumbles Bungalow Murderer Patrick Mahon (who had a bad experience with the head of his victim), and also Harry Jacoby, the hotel busboy who was hanged for killing an elderly woman in the hotel in a robbery. Whether Williams used them or not, he created a great acting part in "Danny", and a wonderful melodrama in NIGHT MUST FALL.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent atmosphere, but the film has more holes than a hunk of Swiss cheese!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently, I am atypical of most people's reaction to this film. With a very respectable 7.2 score, you'd assume it's an above average film and to many it is. In fact, my review and one other are the lowest rated reviews so far on IMDb for this film. However, despite having a great atmosphere and sense of foreboding, I really disliked the film because of its many plot holes and irrational decisions by the characters. And, because of all the very serious plot problems, I am amazed so many people saw this as a perfect or near-perfect film with many reviews giving it a 9 or 10.What I liked, at least initially, was Robert Montgomery's characterization. He played a very charming narcissistic sociopath. He was able to insinuate himself into a rich widow's confidence because he was so clever and manipulative and I loved this aspect of the film. Likewise, at times the atmosphere of the film was very dark and foreboding--it really set you on edge.However, there was so much to dislike if you actually paid attention to the characters. At first, Rosalind Russell seemed very smart and insightful. She saw right through Montgomery's false charms. However, late in the film she simply behaved like she'd had a traumatic brain injury!! First, when the police inspector went through Montgomery's belongings, he came upon a suitcase that obviously had SOMETHING incriminating inside. Yet, inexplicably, Russell then claims the bag is hers!! Why?! She already assumed he was a murderer and was afraid of him--so why stop the inspector from looking inside the bag?! Then, at the end of the film, she leaves the home--and she announces it's for good because she is so afraid of Montgomery. BUT, just a bit later, she returns and brings no one with her--no police backup--nothing. And, she then confronts Montgomery ALL ALONE and insists that he is a killer--at which point he naturally tries to kill her (duh)!! Only because the police happen to arrive at that moment is this dumb dame saved at all!! A truly horrible ending to the film. Now if she'd returned with the police waiting outside and got him to try to kill her or confess to the murders, then this could have worked. As it is, it just seemed stupid.Other things to dislike is Montgomery's performance late in the film where he transforms from smart and evil to silly--like a kid in a high school play trying to pretend to be crazy! He gyrates, faints and over-emotes so badly, it's laughable and transformed a brilliant performance to a campy one. Additionally, the biggest other complaint is that unlike a good mystery/suspense film, there really are no "red herrings". In other words, no one else in the film COULD have committed the murders and so there is no sense of suspense. Having someone else be the actual killer and Montgomery only a schemer would have been a great twist--especially if Montgomery eventually had to take on the real killer. Instead, it was all so obvious and dopey as the film concluded.My verdict is to watch the first 2/3 of the film, then turn it off and create your own ending in your mind. Up until then, it's rather brilliant. You certainly couldn't do any worse!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never trust a guy carrying around a hatbox</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A charming, handsome handyman (Robert Montgomery) wheedles his way into the home of a wealthy old woman (Dame May Witty). Her niece (Rosalind Russell) is suspicious of him and eventually pieces together that he is a murderer the police are looking for. Montgomery being the killer is spoiled in most descriptions of this movie. Even TCM spoils it in their one sentence description on their programming guide. I guess we can't exactly cry foul over spoilers for a movie over 75 years old, but still it makes me wonder if there would have been some added punch for audiences in 1937 who might not have connected the dots right away. Entertaining thriller with a standout performance from Robert Montgomery, who clearly has fun with his part. Witty is excellent as always. Russell is good in one of her first big roles. Her character does a few things that are hard to explain, such as covering for Montgomery even though she knows he's got a severed head in a hatbox! I've read a decent theory that Russell wanted him to kill the old lady and that's why she prevented his arrest earlier. But I'm not convinced that's supported by what we're shown as much as it's people trying to explain away some out of character moments by Russell. Still, it's all good fun and an enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Some Spoilers) Very probably the very first psycho or psychological murder mystery movie released in 1937 23 years before the Alfred Hitchcock movie "Psycho" with the person in question, the psycho, revealed almost as soon as he made his appearance in the film. We get to meet the cute and lovable Danny Boy, Robert Montgomery, when his girlfriend Dora, Merle Tottenham, tried to get her boss Mrs. Bramson, Dame May Ghitty, to act as a matchmaker for her and Danny who's been ignoring her, after promising to marry Dora, of late. Soon Mrs. Barmson forgets about Dora's love life and turns her attention to Danny Boy who's secretly turning the screws or his boyish charms on her. Just before Danny showed up a local woman Mrs.Shellbrook ended up missing in the woods and was feared to have been murdered by a escaped psycho from a nearby mental institution. It seemed that the only person who suspected Danny of being the murderer was Mrs. Barmson's niece Olivia Grayne, Rosaland Russell, who like her aunt and boss Mrs. Bramson fell under Danny's spell.Danny for his part kept on pushing his luck in his relationship with Mrs. Bramson is getting in real tight with the wheelchair ridden old lady where she soon looked upon him as her new found friend sweet Danny the Sailor Boy. Even though it later turned out that Danny's wasn't a sailor at all but in fact a butcher in how he treated his victim, Mrs. Shellbrook, or later victims. He decapitates them! It's when Mrs. Shellbrook's headless body is discovered that Olivia finally comes to the conclusion that it was non other then the sweet and lovable Danny Boy who murdered her. In fact Olivia was so stuck up on Danny that she even helped him cover up his crime by claiming the hat box where he kept Mrs. Shellbrook's severed head was in fact her's when Inspector Belsize,Matthew Boulton, asked Danny if he could examine it!****SPOILERS*** It was Danny's feeling of indestructibly that in the end did him in. Going so far as murdering his boss and benefactor Mrs.Bramson for no other reason then stealing her money, that amounted to about as little as 200 pound shilling, he turned his guns or meat cleaver on Olivia who just happened to come on the murder scene. The fatal mistake Danny made on his part was soon picked up by Olivia's boyfriend and the late Mrs. Bramson's family lawyer Justin Laurie, Alan Marshal, who got in touch with Inspector Belsize and the local police before Danny could go, kitchen knives and meat cleaver in hand, into action!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films that gets lost in the shuffle when it comes to scary thriller films. It needs a re-look by everyone.I'll say right off that I'm a huge Rosalind Russell fan but she was sorta bland in this one. She's a lot better in her screwball comedies. She has a co-headliner in this and he should be cause...he's the star.Robert Montgomery is just super creepy in this. He plays the perfect sociopath in this fine little thriller. You wouldn't think with him in this it would come off as eery and scary as it does but he plays the villain so well it was a pleasure to watch. What makes him so good is that during the film you know he's bad but he doesn't come off that way. It's in a sorta roundabout way with sly inferences here and there. Wait until the end though. Evil finally rears its ugly head.This film is well worth a look in horror/thriller circles. I think it gets overlooked because of its age. Even for 1937 though, it's damn effective if your gonna watch this on a cold/dark Saturday night. Give it a try and be amazed on how well it works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Montgomery's Hat Trick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an English village, roguishly Irish Robert Montgomery (as Danny) worms his way into the household of wealthy hypochondriac May Witty (as Mrs. Bramson). Charmed by Mr. Montgomery's fawning attention, Ms. Witty hires him as her wheelchair-pushing companion. Meanwhile, police search the countryside for a man who has decapitated another woman. Witty's beautiful straight-laced niece, Rosalind Russell (as Olivia Grayne), suspects Montgomery is the killer, and wonders if Witty is next. Yet, Ms. Russell is strangely attracted to Montgomery, even more than handsome lawyer Alan Marshal (as Justin Laurie)."Night Must Fall" entertains greatly due to the Oscar-nominated "Best Actor" performance from Montgomery; he didn't get many roles like this one, but sure knew what to do with it when he had one. At the time, Montgomery served as a romantic attachment to MGM's female leads; here, he shows he can carry a film with the best of them. Russell plays a second fiddle just as well, and Witty thankfully preserves her presence on film; nominated for a "Best Supporting Actress" award, Witty is simply marvelous. The film made several year-end honor rolls, topping the "National Board of Review" as "Best Picture" of 1937.******** Night Must Fall (4/30/37) Richard Thorpe ~ Robert Montgomery, May Witty, Rosalind Russell, Alan Marshal</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Teaching Hitchcock a few lessons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Night Must Fall" was a very offbeat murder thriller for MGM in 1937. It was produced for the main reason that the Emlyn Williams play was a great popular success on both sides of the Atlantic. It may have flopped at the box office for several reasons but certainly not for lack of quality: the acting is superb (the US actors actually making an effort to sound British alongside national British treasures like Dame May Witty, Kathleen Harrison and E.E. Clive), the pacing is vivid and the dynamic music score (by the almost forgotten Edward Ward) was nothing if not prophetic of things to come. In spite of its occasional staginess and theatricality (yes, there is a difference between the two), it was very audacious in bringing adult themes and deep motivational analysis to film narrative, a lesson that wouldn't be lost on the later Hitchcock and a host of film noir and horror directors and writers on both sides of the pond. Hitchcock had used Williams' talents as a journeyman providing additional dialogue to his "Man Who Knew Too Much" but certainly could not afford such a hit as this play with the British film budgets of the time and would certainly have cut deep into its Shakespearian speeches. The film got past the censors in the first place because, to Americans, anything British was considered "quaint" and therefore acceptable - even when the plot almost gets away with murder. Still, its preoccupation with questions of social class, sociopathy, sexual attraction and the slightest hint of a happy end must have been quite a shock to the system for the British movie-going public. It is worth mentioning that this film (and its remake) was banned outright in Finland - where nights are very long indeed - as both outrageous to community standards and too horrific for Scandinavian nerves. Nowadays, there is a heavy metal band fom Finland called "Night Must Fall". In conclusion, this is a film that set up several precedents which have been emulated all through the rest of the XXth century, which makes it an unrecognized cinema masterpiece. Another way of sizing up its brilliance is comparing it to its 1963 remake, which fails in almost every respect.P.S.: The entire film is available on YouTube.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Public's Word Is Law</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night Must Fall was a popular star vehicle on stage for that Welsh renaissance entertainer Emlyn Williams who both wrote and starred in it on the London and New York stage. I'm not sure how Williams felt when his work was sold to MGM and he was not to star in it. But I'm sure even Williams realized he wasn't a box office name.We're far more used to in these days, players stepping outside themselves to expand their range in acting. Back in the day of the big studio system though, the public expected exactly what the studio publicity machines created for images. And Robert Montgomery's image was as a light leading man when he finally found it at MGM. In the beginning of his career Montgomery did play weak and villainous roles. He wanted back in this part and begged Louis B. Mayer for this role.Montgomery got great critical acclaim, deservedly so for playing the homicidal and charming Danny who carries a souvenir trophy of one of his earlier kills in a hat box. He worms his way into the household of Dame May Witty whose current companion, niece Rosalind Russell is getting irritated with the crotchety old biddy. Russell got a career boost from this film herself. She suspects Montgomery of being the worst kind of villain, but she's attracted to his charm as well. Dame May Witty who did the old lady part in London, New York and now Hollywood got an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, but lost to Alice Brady for In Old Chicago.The other Oscar nod for this film went to Robert Montgomery. But while the critics loved him, as they later loved Tyrone Power in Nightmare Alley, the public stayed away in droves. Montgomery later essayed another great homicidal maniac in Rage In Heaven and also retained that Irish brogue for next year in Yellow Jack. Montgomery lost the Oscar sweepstakes to Spencer Tracy for Captains Courageous. Typecasting has frustrated many a player, but there are limits and the public's word is law.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, What's In the Box?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dame May Witty is a bad-tempered wheelchair-bound old woman. She's attended by her niece, Rosalind Russell, a sullen and repressed woman who keeps her eager suitor, Alan Marshal, at arm's length. He's a lawyer in the city, while Witty and Russell live in a woodland cottage. There are two women who serve as day maids. Nota bene: That's four women alone in an isolated house, with two of them gone by nightfall. Always a great set-up for a slasher movie.Then Robert Montgomery shows up. He's more of a caricature than a character. He looks cocky. A cigarette dangles from his lips and he keeps his thumbs hooked in his trouser pockets. He wears this weird topper, a flat hat wider than his head, like a woolen dinner plate.But, man, is he bewitching. He's always cheerful, as quick and perceptive about people as a particularly savvy shrink. He has an Irish accent. He's candid and forthright about himself and what he sees in others. He's loaded with this fey charm and it's easy for him to worm his way into the brutal old lady's graces so that, after some initial protests, she happily hires him as something between a personal attendant and a son.It isn't as though Robert Montgomery didn't have problems, though. Chief among them are the facts, which emerge only point by point during the story, that he's a blatant liar and a sneaky murderer who totes the head of his latest victim around in a hatbox with him.The play was written in 1934. A bit more than thirty years earlier Queen Victoria was on the throne. Victorian England was notorious for its repression of everything that could possibly be defined as "improper", meaning mostly sex and violence but also bad manners and a careless regard for class distinctions. Furniture legs were covered with little draperies. A chicken's "breasts and thighs" became "white and dark meat." It's the kind of atmosphere in which evil could pop unexpectedly, like a pierced carbuncle, an atmosphere that could produce Stevenson's "Doctor Jeykll and Mr. Hyde" or an Alfred Hitchcock.The play's author, Emlyn Williams, was born in 1905 and some of these values are carried over into his plot. Montgomery's character, Danny, smilingly admits that he's always "acting", as if eyes were staring at him. Every once in a while, though he doesn't tell Russell or anyone else, the zit pops and he dismembers somebody.Montgomery does a fine job with Danny. He always appears gawky. His movements are sudden and jerky, and his speech comes in bursts. Eventually, along with Russell, the viewer realizes that Danny is not merely acting but overacting. He races around singing and whistling and flattering the grouchy matron. He pushes her wheelchair too quickly. Everything he does is in fits and spasms.Russell's part is pretty complicated. She has to begin as a buttoned-up spinster who resents the lower-class Danny, but then becomes interested in him, half repelled and half attracted sexually, so much so that she saves his bacon when the police begin to suspect him of a local murder.Danny is the sort of guy who, if he didn't exist, would not be necessary to invent, but he does accomplish some good unwittingly. He opens up Rosalind Russell's passions and causes to her act out her desires.The movie is a little slow. It's not the action-filled mystery with cheap effects that we've become used to. The pace picks up towards the end. And it's not without weakness. The cynical and tough old lady finds herself alone in the house at night and instantly turns into a quivering mass of Jello. There's been no indication that this transmogrification from brick wall into vulnerability was coming -- or was even possible.But, that aside, it's a neatly drawn picture of aborted predation, of character and the evolution of character.</fullReview>

Emlyn Williams' successful stage production becomes first-rate dramatic film, with careful attention to character motivation and dialogue (and gleefully nasty, sordid little details besides). Unfortunately, it all unravels in the final reel, which does allow Oscar-nominated Robert Montgomery a chance to pull out the stops, though at the expense of credibility. Beautiful production, terrific supporting performance from May Witty. Followed in 1964 by a critically-drubbed remake. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A psychological thriller with few thrills but some fine acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Times sure have changed. In 1935, George M. Cohan wrote of the play "The best thrill play I ever saw - and I've seen 'em all. It takes you by the throat and leaves you gasping." Perhaps it's unfair to compare it with Psycho, the best thriller of all time, but the comparison is like black and white. The only thrills here is in the last 20 minutes or so, and they are mild. The movie opened up the one-set play a bit, which helped vary the surroundings, but it still felt like a filmed play. The two saving graces were in the performances of Oscar nominees Dame May Whitty and Robert Montgomery, both a pleasure to watch. Whitty dominates all the scenes she is in, and Montgomery plays his murderous sweetness to perfection. The movie is worth seeing for these two performers.For those interested in credits, I had a hard time spotting Winifred Harris, who is billed tenth. But if you believe the second set of opening credits which specified the cast in order of appearance, she should have appeared before tour guide E.E. Clive. There must have been some scenes cut because she appeared last, and barely at that. She has no lines and was in the background.</fullReview>
