		<shortDescription>Grace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Delightful, witty screenplay. A collection of perfectly constructed moments of awkwardness, beautifully photographed by Ruttenberg and Surtees (who did Oklahoma, The Graduate and Last Time i Saw Paris between them) and perfectly shot by Charles Vidor. A fun performance by Alec Guinness as Prince Albert who visits Grace Kelly's princess on a tour of all the princesses in the country, in search of a wife. Louis Jordan, as the young professor, contender for the princess's affections, is very good and looks like a young Colin Firth.Grace Kelly looks lovelier than ever, and is quite excellent in the role of her life - the role she played for the statesmen of Hollywood. She was just a little girl from Philadelphia who looked like a princess, so they asked her to learn to speak like a princess. And she did. They sent her tapes of elegant speech, and gave her tuition in elegance - and she played the part perfectly. The fun, flirtatious girl she was remained hidden from the public by the press, who in those days co-operated with the Hollywood political establishment. For all the public knew, Grace Kelly was merely a beautiful, elegant woman who played herself on screen. This was not the case. Like Humphrey Bogart, she was not originally like her on screen persona, but like Cary Grant, she eventually became it - through outside circumstance, when she was proposed to by Prince Rainier of Monaco, who met her on a publicity stunt visit. Here, Grace took the elegant persona of Dial M for Murder and Rear Window a step further, anticipating what it would be like to be an actual princess. In less than a year she would know from personal experience, but in The Swan she predicts the feeling perfectly, coming off looking completely genuine. She depicts the confusion of the princess beautifully, the awkwardness and uncertainty despite best intentions. She reveals her feelings at once in the "box him on the ears" speech beautifully - watch her eyes. Such a tender, genuine moment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Charming Story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read a review proclaiming Grace Kelly was a young girl from Wisconsin, who made a hit in Hollywood, and became a real life princess. The Philadelphia, Pennsylvania native met her Prince at a photo match arranged by Paris Match in Monte Carlo, Monaco. She later transcended the realm of film and married the reigning prince of one of Europe's oldest principalities. Grace Kelly, later HSH Princess Grace of Monaco was as lovely as she was talented. She totally restructured Hollywood, giving it an old world elegance. This is the same charming appeal she brought to the film, "The Swan." She plays Princess Alexandra who finds herself torn between obeying her overpowering mother and marrying her cousin, Prince Albert, or following the dictates of her own heart. The battle for her heart is waged by two dashing gentlemen, the prince, Alec Guinness, and the poor but respectable tutor, Louis Jourdan. It is a movie that is entertaining and for those with a romantic disposition!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Princess Grace's "Swan Song"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before her marriage to Prince Rainier, Grace Kelly made this next-to-last film for M-G-M, the royalty (though, alas, in somewhat of a decline from its glory days) of Hollywood's studio "system." I thought it, along with "High Society," a graceful exit for the lovely Miss Kelly, and M-G-M surrounded her with thorough professionals both before and behind the CinemaScope cameras. I especially enjoyed Alec Guinness, Jessie Royce Landis, and the wonderful Estelle Winwood, as well as Brian Aherne and Louis Jourdan. It's not available on DVD (and may possibly never be) and, I fear, the VHS version is formatted to fit the full screens of non-widescreen TVs. Too bad...It's a handsome production which, no doubt, won't visually impress very much when diminished by, ugh!, "formatting." What's wrong with "letterboxing," may I ask? Maybe it's the word itself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lovely movie!! Starring the lovely Grace Kelly (Princess Alexandra), the wonderful actor Alec Guinness (Prince Albert), and last but not least, the young and wonderful dashing Louis Jourdan (Tutor/Professor, Nicholas Agi), the trio knows how to make a lovely film. Alexandra is to be married to the Prince, to restore the lost throne, and then at a Ball, she falls inlove with Nicholas while dancing with him. She has to make a hard choice; either marry the man she loves, or become a queen with Prince Albert. There are funny parts, allot of Royalty, and is beautifully filmed, and a really good movie. 2 thumbs up!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crowned Heads of Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grace Kelly is one of the great icons of the twentieth century, partly on account of her extraordinary beauty but also on account of the fact that she is the only person to have belonged to both of the world's two most glamorous and exclusive elites, the Crowned Heads of Europe and the Crowned Heads of Hollywood. "The Swan" was her penultimate film before her marriage to Prince Rainier (her last was to be "High Society") and it is the only film in which she actually portrays a princess. It is sometimes said, probably inaccurately, that MGM deliberately chose it as a vehicle for Kelly in order to cash in on the publicity surrounding her romance with Prince Rainier. In fact, the decisions to make the film and to cast Kelly in the leading role seem to have been taken before that romance was public knowledge. The story is one that must have seemed very old-fashioned even in the fifties. It is based on a play by Ferenc Molnár, the Hungarian author who also wrote the drama which served as the basis for "Carousel", the film version of which also appeared in 1956. Two other films, neither of which I have seen, have been based on Molnár's play, a silent from 1925 and an early talkie from 1930. The setting is a kingdom somewhere in Central Europe in the year 1910. The country is never named in the film; we catch a brief glimpse of a Hungarian flag, although the royal family at the centre of the action bears no resemblance to the Habsburg rulers of Austria-Hungary at this period. Kelly plays Princess Alexandra, the daughter of a junior branch of the ruling dynasty, who is the intended bride of her cousin Prince Albert, the heir to the throne. The exact relationship between the two is never made clear. At one point it is implied that Alexandra's late father was the younger brother of Albert's father, the current King, which would make them first cousins, but at other times it is suggested that at one time Alexandra's branch of the family were monarchs in their own right of a neighbouring country but were deprived of their throne by Napoleon, which would suggest that the kinship of Albert and Alexandra is much more distant.The two families hope that a true romance will develop between Albert and Alexandra, but she is starting to fall in love with Professor Agi, the handsome young tutor employed to teach her two younger brothers. (I presume that his title of "Professor" is an honorary one; I doubt if the holder of a genuine academic chair at a university would want to abandon it for the dubious privilege of tutoring two minor royals). The situation between Alexandra, Albert and Agi, however, is not really a love-triangle because the only love involved is that of Alexandra and Agi. Albert seems to have no sexual or romantic interest in Alexandra or anyone else, being more interested in duck-shooting and playing football than in women. I wondered, in fact, if Alec Guinness (himself bisexual) were trying to imply that Albert may secretly be gay, something of course which could not have been made explicit in the cinema of the fifties. As another reviewer has pointed out, a man would have to be either gay or mad to show no sexual interest in Grace Kelly. She is as lovely as ever in this film, although in terms of her acting it is not really her best. This was Guinness's first American film. He had, of course, already become a huge star in Britain, appearing in some of the finest British films of the late forties and early fifties, such as David Lean's "Great Expectations" and Ealing comedies like "The Ladykillers". His appearance here, however, must have come as something of a disappointment to American audiences, as it is one of his least interesting performances. In Guinness's defence, however, it could be said that Albert was written as a stiff, wooden character and that the task of making such a character interesting is a difficult one. (Even Laurence Olivier was to fail in this task the following year in "The Prince and the Showgirl", another film set in the early 1910s about the love-life of a prince from Central Europe). Guinness, moreover, was too old for the role; he was 42 at the time, and Albert is supposed to be 33. His next American film, "Bridge on the River Kwai", was to be a far more successful one. Louis Jourdan is rather better as Agi, although his French accent seems a bit out of place given that Agi is supposed to be a compatriot of Albert and Alexandra, not a foreigner. (It might have been better to have rewritten the script to make the professor a Frenchman). The film is sometimes described as a romantic comedy, and indeed for much of the time it is played as an amusing trifle, with the princess's relatives being portrayed as comically eccentric. It is, however, a comedy with a serious underlying theme- the choice between love and duty- and without the expected happy ending. Indeed, I felt that the film's major weakness was the inability of the scriptwriter and director Charles Vidor to decide whether it was supposed to be a comedy or a serious psychological drama. The producer Dore Schary had something of a reputation for producing what his boss Louis B Mayer called "message pictures", and there are hints of this in "The Swan" when Agi, who is from a humble family background, starts lecturing the Prince about class distinctions. The film ends up as a sort of mixture of comic operetta and socialist pamphlet, a mixture which never really comes off. On a final note, I found the background music loud and intrusive, often preventing me from clearly hearing what was being said. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Molnar needs to be done with style, taste and wit--all of which qualities this dramatization has. The cast is stellar, with the future Princess Grace surrounded by the likes of Alec Guiness, Louis Jourdan, Estelle Winwood, and Jessie Royce Landis, to name a few.The pace is very regal and leisurely, I'd say in "Adagio tempo," appropriate to the delicate nature of the royal estate. Bronislau Kaper's score captures the distinguished atmosphere, and the set decor is done with great care.Charles Vidor's direction is dignified and the character interaction has genuine charm. I greatly respect MGM for creating so noble a work, and find the widescreen DVD most appealing.Fine work done by all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Disturbing Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't give it the "awful" rating because it's beautiful filmed and all the acting is splendid. It's a gorgeous film, and it is simply awful. The woman has had no life of her own, she's been ruled by her mother, done what her mother demanded, and never let herself feel. Finally, the situation between the tutor and the Prince she is supposed to marry, becomes explosive and in that explosion she realizes her true feelings -- more than that: she realizes she HAS feelings. And of course she's a princess and she's going to marry the Prince, it doesn't matter who she loves. But that happens in Roman Holiday and the princess is going to feel it and love the man involved for the rest of her life. The ending of this film with Alec Guinness saying she's the swan gliding through life, having no feelings and he's the same, playing their roles. Oh god, it's horrible. How can anyone call that romantic???? It's a total denial of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grace Kelly, the perfect swan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Swans are beautiful, elegant creatures. So who better to portray the human embodiment of a swan than the beautiful, elegant Grace Kelly? Our story unfolds in 1910 with Kelly playing young Princess Alexandra, a minor royal in some fictional European nation. Her family's fortune has faded and her mother desperately desires for Alexandra to marry the heir to the throne, Prince Albert, and thus restore her family to the throne they lost. Prince Albert is Alexandra's cousin but don't mind that because marrying your cousin was quite the royal thing to do at the time. As it turns out Albert is a bit of an odd duck. He has rejected many potential brides and now he has come to call on Alexandra to see if perhaps she is the one. But the prince's social awkwardness sinks this romance before it ever starts. Alexandra isn't exactly warm and loving either, a bit of an ice princess. As the would-be romance founders Alexandra's desperate mother hatches a plot.The mother urges her daughter to show an interest in Nicholas, who tutors Alexandra's younger brothers. Nicholas is a nice enough guy, but a commoner, certainly not a real romantic possibility for a princess. He is just to be used to hopefully make Prince Albert jealous. But Nicholas doesn't know this. He's been carrying a torch for Alexandra all along and now he thinks he's got his big chance. Complications ensue, suffice to say things don't really go according to plan for anyone involved. At least here the drama picks up a bit, prior to this the film had been a little bit flat and mundane. While there are some decent comedic moments sprinkled throughout there aren't nearly enough laughs to make the film work as a comedy. So for the film to succeed the story has to really grab you. The drama has to be compelling and for much of the film it is really not. Kelly is terrific in a role which suits her perfectly. And Alec Guinness is reliably excellent in playing Prince Albert. But just as the romance between their two characters never sparks to life so too does the movie lack a certain energy. A reasonably engaging, enjoyable film but it leaves you wanting more. The film's somewhat surprising conclusion is a bit of a letdown as well. At least that ending provides an explanation for why Alexandra is thought of as a swan. The comparison between the beautiful bird and the beautiful woman works well. The movie as a whole does not work nearly as perfectly. A great vehicle for the lovely Kelly, with some good work from Guinness and Louis Jourdan, playing the tutor, as well. But the excellent performers could have done so much more had they had a more engrossing story to work with. Kelly is so good, and so radiant, that it is worth seeing the film for her alone. You're just left wishing the film had a little bit more to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romance for an era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With rare exceptions (i.e., 'The Age of Innocence' and 'The Painted Veil,' among a few), too many contemporary movies set in earlier (from Elizabethan to Oscar Wildean) times miss out from a distinct failure to capture apparent period authenticity in manner or speech, be it: 'A Perfect Husband;' 'The Importance of Being Earnest'; 'Moulin Rouge;' 'The Other Boleyn Girl;' etc.Not so here.Every moment and character in director Charles Vidor's 'The Swan' (with the possible exception of usually adept Agnes Moorehead) takes one to an aristocratic pre-WW1 middle-Europe - at least, in Ferenc Molnar's stage conceit from 1922.Fortunate enough to have purchased the laser-disc widescreen issue in the mid-1990s, continue to enjoy every telling exchange among the principals in the exploration of the values of a long by-gone era, politically dated as they might be - which intent might have been the author's, whether Mr. Molnar's or screenwriter John Dighton's. Not for nothing does the introductory scene convey the off-handed delivery of bread from the local baker.Mr. Guinness is wrong in age as the heir to the throne (after all, 'Kwai;' 'Tunes of Glory,' and 'The Horse's Mouth,' were only a few years away), but acquits himself fairly well, altogether.Ms. Kelly was slightly past taking on roles of ingénues, but does herself proud in coming across as the well-bred princess but unsophisticated woman in matters of the heart; brought up as she has been in obedient fashion towards her elders, her lack of experience makes feasible her deception towards the initially indifferent Prince Albert, as it certainly does her surprise of the unintentional emotional hurt of Professor Agi (Louis Jourdan), the man whom she makes the unwitting instrument of the deceit.Jourdan, as a matter of fact, is in best form possible, convincing as he lets down his long-held reserve towards Alexandra and, more importantly for the piece, is assured in the English language, better so than in other performances.SPOILER: Certain wonderful moments can best be experienced on-screen, particularly during the moment of truth between Alexandra and Professor Agi, as: Alexandra (to Agi): "Don't come any closer Nicholas...I have never seen a man in love...(with sudden awareness) and he happens to be in love with me!" Would not dare spoil any other such quote, such as when Uncle Carl (Brian Aherne), standing near the young lovers, wisely observes that the emotion that they share may never again be as deep or as true, but that nevertheless, it is perhaps already fleeting.Restoration of 'The Swan' in DVD form is imperative. Leave it to younger audiences to sort out its relevance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Swan is a magnificently beautiful film in every way--sets, costumes, dancing and music, dialogue, and the actors. Of course Grace Kelly is noted for her blonde regal beauty. Louis Jourdan is the most gorgeous man to ever grace film. The two together, Grace and Louis, are almost too much to watch. They are stunning together.Their characters, Princess Alexandra and Dr. Nicholas Agi, are just as lovely to watch. From the beginning, Dr. Agi's love for the Princess is clearly evident, and as her attraction to him develops, the audience hopes for the romance to culminate in a romantic Royal Wedding. Alas, that does not happen. Alexandra cannot bring herself to follow her heart and to succumb to love for Nicholas. Instead, after the most enchanting waltz, he realizes the truth and prepares to depart the palace the following morning. Does she merely pity him, as he claims, or does she love him but reject him because he is a tutor and not of royal birth? Or is it that Nicholas is Alexandra's first romance and she realizes it will never last? For whatever reason, Nicholas rides out of her life, leaving her heartbroken yet awaiting future happiness.It takes Alexandra's uncle, the Father Carl Hyacinth (Brian Aherne), to provide the insights and truths that guide Alexandra into letting Nicholas go. Carl realizes his niece's inexperienced youth, and assures her that true love will find her in due course. Of course, we are left at the end to wonder of that comes in the form of the (forced) marriage to her cousin Prince Albert (Alec Guinness). We must each answer that question for ourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>View this film. Though it's not a great film, it is entertaining, and, its theme is rare.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Swan" is in that relatively small niche of films in which duty or honor trump love.Obvious examples of the duty/honor-trump-love genre include "Roman Holiday," "The Prisoner of Zenda," "Casablanca," "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence," "Shakespeare in Love," "Interstellar," (arguably) "Camelot," and some superhero stories (especially Superman). If you like these movies, you will probably like "The Swan." (OK, I'm not too fond of the molasses "Camelot," but I do like the others.)Here is Why:(Skip down to the next section if you're not into movie pedantry ? I couldn't resist :-).This genre involves a triangle consisting of at least one worthy hero, a worthy heroine, a clear duty, and a tension involving that duty and love between the hero and heroine. However, the hero or the heroine ends up yielding to the duty rather than seizing the love (a variant is "Liberty Valence," where, instead, perhaps the heroine does not end up with the hero she should). The hero/heroine love need not be romantic, e.g., "Interstellar" involves father- daughter love.Frequently, a fourth element is added in the form of a second, less sympathetic, suitor for the heroine, forming a more traditional romantic triangle. The second suitor is usually the proxy of the duty, i.e., the duty requires the heroine to choose the second suitor. ("The Swan" falls into this case.)Also typically, the hero makes the noble decision to not take the prize of the heroine (exceptions include "Roman Holiday," where the heroine makes the decision, "Shakespeare in Love," where the Queen commands it, and "Liberty Valence" where the John Wayne character makes the decision). The great cause requiring the noble sacrifice can be family honor (as in "The Swan"), patriotism, humanity, or religion, among others.To be clear, there are many tragic themes that do not fall into the duty/honor-trump love genre. These other themes are often sorrowful, but just not do carry the same emotional undertones. Hence, I do not include happy-ending duty/honor-vs-love stories such as "The Four Feathers;" death-for-love sacrifice stories, such as "Titanic," "A Star is Born," "A Tale of Two Cities," or "Five Graves to Cairo," (a relatively common theme); other sacrificial stories such as "Gypsy;" or sacrificial subplots within stories, of which there are gazillions (think "Gone With the Wind" or many war films). I also discard deferred-gratification-with-hope stories such as "The Prince and the Showgirl" or "Hollywood Canteen." Further, the genre is exactly the opposite of love-trumps-duty stories such as "Romeo and Juliet" and its dozens of derivatives, and "Love Story" and its many wrong-side-of-the-tracks variants, in which characters defy duty to obtain love, with the inference that the duty is improper or even offensive.Films in the duty/honor-trump-love category tend to have sad and somewhat ambiguous endings, and "The Swan" fits right into that mold. Truly great and memorable films in the duty/honor-trump-love genre tend to be high tension, powerfully emotional, passionate, moving, and intense, packing a demonstrative wallop and encouraging a wet eye or even a tear. Unfortunately, in this respect, "The Swan" disappoints. It does not drive the poignant punch of most of the examples above. The letdown in "The Swan" is certainly not due to the cast, the costumes, the pacing, or the sets, all of which are wonderfully first rate and make the film worth watching. Grace Kelly alone makes this film worthwhile. You will be entertained, you will be hopeful, you will be charmed -- but comes the placard that says "The End," you will be wondering if someone forgot the last reel.The problem is the story and script, in which the Grace Kelly character spends only a tiny sliver of the film falling, without much motivation, for the Louis Jourdan character. Contrast the significant amount of time "Roman Holiday" spends building the deep connection between the Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck characters. By the end of "Roman Holiday," the audience is so invested in the pair, that their sacrifice, while understandable, is nevertheless heartrending. Similarly, consider the number of scenes in "Casablanca" developing Humphrey Bogart's and Ingrid Bergman's characters. On the other hand, the love of Grace Kelly's princess with the Professor comes across more as shallow puppy love, a brief and contrived infatuation. The audience is simply not upset with the turn of events. The viewer observes the events from afar but does not live it.Footnote:BTW, when folks say "they don't make films like that anymore," they are correct about this genre. This category has become even rarer since the 1960s. (Ok, a few remakes here and there, and "Shakespeare in Love," and "Interstellar," and some "Superman" flicks, and a few others). The bulk of the offerings seem to originate in the 1920s through the 1940s.Perhaps this rarity can be explained either by notions of duty and honor being less strong or popular post-WWII, or maybe by "downer" movies not generating the required revenues. (I tend to lean towards the first explanation; "Titanic," "Shakespeare," and "Interstellar" demonstrate that sad and even tragic endings can be profitable.)A further observation is that movies in this genre are almost always period or other-world pieces, never in real modernity (with the possible exception of "Roman Holiday," and even that is fairy-tale flavored). The message is that this is the selfish "Me" generation, chivalry and nobility are dead, and nothing in 21st century western civilization can trump love. Even Superman comics have given in (though not yet the films ? I predict they will). Simply, in our day and age, we are expected to have no duties, loyalties, or honor greater than love. Perhaps this is why, when we see modern sad films, they are usually "Romeo and Juliet" or "Love Story" or "Titanic" themed films.Watch this film ? it is enjoyable, though not great, and its theme is less common than you think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The accompanying publicity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one of those life imitates art situations Grace Kelly gave her farewell performance on the big screen playing a princess. She left the screen to become a princess, Princess Grace of Monaco. No Hollywood scriptwriter could come up with that.I wish she had left after High Society though. The Swan is a rather old fashioned drama set in 1910 with a royal family of some Ruritanian principality finding themselves in a financial bind. Jessie Royce- Landis and her three kids, Grace Kelly, Christopher Cook, and Van Dyke Parks will have to live in reduced circumstances and have to give up among other things, the royal tutor Louis Jourdan. That is unless mom can get visiting cousin Prince Alec Guinness interested in a royal match with Princess Grace. But when he arrives he's essentially quite indifferent to her. Which gets Jourdan's goat because he's crushing out big time.This kind of work without the accompanying publicity of Grace Kelly's real life wedding to Prince Rainer probably would have died at the box office. It's a story way too old fashioned for 1956 tastes let alone now. The choices that this family is forced to make would be imposed on most of royal Europe by the end of the decade, forced on people holding much bigger titles than this family has.No one set foot in Europe as this was shot in a recreated castle in North Carolina by the Vanderbilt family. Since that time the location has been used for several films. It certainly is one fine replica.In a recent biography of Alec Guinness it is reported that Guinness who got along with his co-stars did not with director Charles Vidor. It certainly didn't affect his performance. Guinness was a brilliant player but a strangely neurotic man who had a lot of issues.Grace Kelly did not end her acting career on a high note with The Swan. More like a middle C.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful to look at and has its moments, but it could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Molnar's play "The Swan" was dug up as a vehicle for Grace Kelly in the last year or two of her brief Hollywood career. She's teamed here with the always skillful Alec Guinness and Louis Jourdain, who could get by on his handsome looks alone but is equally fine in his role.The premise of the film is clever: A plot to snag a prince into marriage goes awry, and the story then hinges on which of two men--royalty or commoner--will win the hand of the innocent but gradually awakening "swan." One of the problems I had with the film is that it begins with a lot of comedy and then turns, rather abruptly, into something, if not darker, then decidedly more serious. The ending comes rather suddenly, and neither genre--comedy or drama--quite hits the mark to render the film satisfactory, let alone memorable.Of the three major players, Grace Kelly is the least effective, doing her frequent "upper class" act, complete with irritating voice mannerisms. Here, I suppose, it's at least appropriate, and fans of Kelly won't be disappointed. Jessie Royce Landis, Estelle Winwood, and Brian Aherne are fine; Agnes Moorehead arrives like gangbusters late in the film and injects some broad comedy when that aspect of the story has already passed. The film is beautifully shot, great to look at, with lavish sets and costumes. Just wish the director or writer or ? had figured out what they wanted the film to be. The downbeat ending doesn't work here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Delightfully Witty and Insightful Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting to note that The Swan's screenplay writer/adapter, John Dighton, also co-wrote the screenplay for "Roman Holiday", since one can logically assume that MGM's decision to film Molnar's play "The Swan" was inspired by the success of the earlier film; the similarities are obvious."Swan" must be regarded as one of the great DIALOGUE films of the '50's; the exchanges between all of the characters are continually witty and engaging, and the cast clearly relished the opportunity to perform such beautifully written material. The direction is fine and, except for a few slow patches, keeps the action and dialogue moving at a rapid clip. The performances are uniformly solid, with Alec Guiness in top form as the bemused, distracted and somewhat shallow Crown Prince Alexander; a more deft and perfectly controlled performance could not be imagined.Jessie Royce Landis also excels in a typically thankless sort of role, and a major one at that. In fact, the expert performances are clearly the result of the high level of STAGE experience of Guiness, Landis, and Brian Aherne (as the aristocrat-turned-monk Karl), among others. You almost feel that you are watching Molnar's original play in a filmed version, so fascinating is the chamber-like, character-driven nature of the dialogue and action.The scene near the end where Alec Guiness convinces his mad-cap Queen/mother (Agnes Moorehead) to unknowingly give her blessing to the romance between Grace Kelly and Louis Jordan is but one of the many delightful, dazzlingly-delivered dialogue scenes.Oddly, I found Grace Kelly's much-heralded performance to lack a certain amount of intensity; her screen presence rarely seems particularly commanding; this may be due to the essentially reticent nature of her character. However, she definitely seemed to "catch fire"--in all of her understated, regal beauty---during her lengthy waltz scene with Louis Jordan. One really senses the awakening of her deepest emotions, even though she only occasionally glances at her partner. And then goofy Alec Guiness decides to go play the double-bass in the court orchestra instead of romancing Grace. I laughed out loud.My reaction at the end of the film was rather unexpected, given what I knew of the "Roman Holiday-style" ending. In that film, I was heart- broken during Gregory Peck's long, lonely final walk. But here---due entirely to the very real, conflicted nature of all three principal characters, I felt that Grace Kelly's choice may have been, in fact, the better one. It's difficult to know, human nature being a rather complex thing. And therein lies much of the brilliance of this film.Bronislau Kaper's score is also delightful, and beautifully captures the musical idiom of the era and its locale, the "swan song" as it were of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, whose faded glory would become extinct less than a decade later.A FILM THAT SHOULD BE FAR BETTER KNOWN AND ACCLAIMED THAN IT IS.LR</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and NOT romantic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boring, ridiculous, despicable, annoying.I guess I'm stupid.I don't understand this film.Yeah yeah, duty over desire, but that does not even apply, she doesn't have to marry him??!! The prince surely doesn't seem in love with her, he needs a queen, and towards the end he seems to take pity on her, who turned from a plank to a teenager in love (very unconvincingly). Maybe that what he's supposed to be? Her rescuer?The family schemes to get the prince, so the professor becomes a token, despicably so. Then his advances soften her, but she wants to be a queen, she's so sorry, can he forgive her. No, he says. He gets all angry with everybody and holds socialist speeches, which are somehow connected with his admiration for Napoleon (lol!). She likes that for some reason, or his hurt pride, or whatever. So now she's in love, with a vengeance. I can actually accept that, putting aside the improbability of its sudden appearance. The way she's in love is believable. Then the prince insults the professor, he wants to retort, she stops him with a kiss - that ends it for him---huh??? Says she kissed him out of pity, like she would kiss a dog - huh??? Well I love my dogs! With passion!:-)So then he leaves and everybody manipulates her thoughts and so she is a swan again, who actually are rather aggressive animals on land, while I have found geese to be much gentler! I thought the ending was tragic. Nothing funny or romantic in it. And just for her I say that, as I don't understand the professor beyond the kiss. And I don't care. I guess he just didn't want to bother with her fickleness, or a kiss was all he wanted... You know, I like Alec Guiness, but even the uncle is more dashing than him with his moustache-twirling and his padded chest (or so it looked - ridiculous!) - shudder.All hail to the aunt!So, first hour boredom extraordinaire, then a little one-sided romance and a lot of overacted drama about it, very confusing, at the end back to the ice swan - great. Fantastic. Call that entertainment?But, as I mentioned, I just didn't get it.Just my two cents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Swan is The Awkward Duckling **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While there are some very funny moments in the film as well as a wonderful performance by Jesse Royce Landis as a scheming mother, the picture falls flat mainly due to the ending.Here we are happy to see that convention will be put aside as Grace Kelly would marry her true lover. Instead, we have an ending quite similar to "The Student Prince." It's as if everyone has to do their monarchical duty, no matter what the consequences.While radiant here and as always, Grace Kelly is rather boring, particularly at the beginning. She appears to be afraid of life. Ditto for Alec Guiness as the prince. With his dull speeches, he seems to finally wake up towards the end of the film.Brian Aherne does well as the uncle who turned to the priesthood to get away from the royal way of living. Ms. Landis is wonderful as she shows that even in the royal family, scheming shall prevail. She gets a good run for her money from Agnes Moorehead, who comes in and deftly steals her scenes away as Guiness's royal mother.No wonder Estelle Winwood lived to 103. Nothing probably ever bothered her and as a royal aunt in the film, she takes her place without misgivings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The making of a princess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More than Charles Boyer,Louis Jourdan was par excellence the French lover;he was so handsome that pairing him with supreme beauty Grace Kelly was only natural;Alec Guiness seems out of place next to this dream couple.It should be noted that Jourdan was never big in his native country where he made some interesting movies ("Premier Rendez-Vous" )but no memorable masterpiece :he was probably too handsome for his own good.Whereas France was asking for plebeian heroes (Jean Gabin) he was some kind of aristocratic person.But not in "the swan": he is a proletarian ,an educated proletarian (they always call him "the teacher" ,"the professor" and the princess learns his first name halfway through the movie) but a man of common birth . Which makes "the swan" a fairy tale in reverse : everyone knows his place (scene of the kiss) ,even the romantic gorgeous lady becomes sensible and reneges on her love."When a swan leaves his lake,he becomes gauche" ."A Star dragged down into the mud" .The aristocrats (particularly the ladies and even the clergy) are hard on the others.The story takes place at the beginning of the last century at a time a princess could not marry a peasant ;and today ,if they do not marry a noble ,they make sure he's got plenty of dough ;ditto for the princes.The movie became prophetic :Grace Kelly was so credible as a princess she became one in real life.Strong supporting cast :Jessica Royce Landis (who was also Kelly's mother in "to catch a thief"),Estelle Winwood and Agnes Moorehead .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sophisticated wit, sentimental tragedy of a girl who will not compromise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charming and witty comedy of a uncompromising princess and two suitors -- the penniless tutor and the worldly Prince. Wonderful casting throughout, though Grace Kelly is, as always, less an actress than a beautiful presence. Audrey Hepburn would have been ideal, and should have been cast in the Kelly role. I'm a fan of Agnes Moorhead, but more impartial viewers may find her a bit much. The Molnar play upon which the film is based is pretty much intact and holding its own. This is an unusual offering for a Hollywood film -- not quite a Ruritanian romance, not quite a Shavian exercise in philosophical banter, but containing the sentimentality of the one and the badinage of the other along with a bit of the Gallic savoir faire of Giradeaux and Annuilh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starring Grace Kelly, who married Prince Rainier that same year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was only a kid of 10 when the whole Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier courtship and marriage thing was happening and, being a small town boy who would rather be exploring the woods with my dog than sitting in a movie house, Grace Kelly was only a faint blur on my mental radar screen. So it was fun to see this movie, 'The Swan', this week on the TCM channel. It gets its name because her deceased father had always called her his swan. Because of a combination of factors, her family had lost its status, and her mother was urging her to marry her second cousin, a prince played by Alec Guinness, so that they could enter royalty again. The love triangle is completed by Louis Jourdan who plays the tutor of her two younger brothers. This is not a particularly good story, in fact without the lure of the leads, it would not be worth watching. Kelly's character, to me, is an insult to all women, because she has no ambition other than to fill her mother's wishes to marry into royalty. Of further interest, timing of the release of the movie was a few days after Kelly and Rainier married, to take full advantage of the publicity.SPOILERS, for my benefit, please read no further. Kelly and Jourdan become the obviously best couple. Her character and Guinness' have no attraction, he is willing to take her as a wife, as the right thing to do. In the end, she denies her real desire, she agrees to enter a loveless marriage with the Prince to make things better for the family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very pretty but somewhat empty package</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very lovely film to look at--with lots of opulent dresses, a lovely palace locale and pretty people such as Louis Jordan and Grace Kelly. However, once you peel away all the loveliness, the film itself isn't all that special despite a few decent performances here and there. That's because of two serious faults--very stilted and controlled performances as well as occasionally awful dialog. If you take out these factors, the basic fairy tale story is pretty good and I liked the way the movie ended.Now as far as the stilted acting goes, some of this was definitely required for the film. The royal family was supposed to be stiff and proper but after a while, this just seemed too much--particularly with Grace Kelly. As a result, this good actress just was a pretty person in pretty clothes and that's about all! This was made worse by the less than sparkling dialog between her and Jordan. When they started talking about love and she "let loose", it just sounded syrupy and silly--lacking all realism and sounding like it came straight out of a really bad romance novel. Frankly, I found these scenes, at times, a bit embarrassing--they were that silly.Fortunately, apart from these problems, the film is still rather enjoyable--particularly Alec Guinness' performance--though I must admit his character was a tad inconsistent. I also wondered if the writers' intent was to make him seem like he might be a latent homosexual--showing no interest in any women--even the lovely Grace Kelly (he must have been gay or insane). This sort of thing never would have been alluded to in the 1950s, but this would have made the film a lot more interesting had they pursued this! Also, the supporting roles were well done and the film did provide a nice, though not especially deep, diversion.Several other reviews have alluded to this being Grace Kelly's "swan song" to Hollywood. Ironically, in this film she plays a member of the royalty that contemplates giving it all up to become a commoner, whereas in real life it was the opposite--with Kelly marrying the Prince of Monaco.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Molnar's bygone relic makes dull exit for Grace Kelly...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Capitalizing on Grace's intention to marry a prince in Monaco, MGM dusted off Molnar's antique play, a comedy of manners involving a princess torn between the love of two men--ALEC GUINNESS (as her second cousin) and handsome LOUIS JOURDAN (as the tutor of her young brothers). By the time she makes her choice, you won't care.On this painfully dull story, they've spared no expense to give the production a handsome cast adept at assuming royal manners--BRIAN AHERNE, AGNES MOOREHEAD, JESSIE ROYCE LANDIS, ESTELLE WINWOOD and ROBERT COOTE, among others, and Charles Vidor was chosen to direct Kelly's last film at Metro.The ice princess herself is perfectly at home in such material, never once letting a believable expression disturb the beauty of her classic features. She's strictly playing herself in an arch manner and letting others do the real emoting. There's plenty of eye candy aside from Grace, the sets and costumes being beyond reproach.But it's a stuffy affair, talky and full of dull stretches where almost nothing happens to move the story forward. Women will adore watching Grace parade around in a number of fetching costumes and will no doubt enjoy seeing her paired with Jourdan in the more intimate scenes.But overall, it's an awful bore with its chief compensation being a delightful cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated gem mired in a muddy reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Molnar's stately examination of romance and duty, THE SWAN, made a slightly disappointing "swan song" for Grace Kelly in Hollywood (it and the delightful PHILADELPHIA STORY remake, HIGH SOCIETY with Cole Porter songs, marked her final two studio films before marrying Prince Rainier of Monaco who she met at a photo shoot at the Cannes Film Festival following her filming Alfred Hitchcock's TO CATCH A THIEF in his principality on the Mediterranean - near the borders of France and Italy). The disappointment today is less in the undeniably beautiful film itself than the undeserved reputation for "emptiness" and misconceptions which have grown up around it and served to limit the film's showings and the knowledge of Princess Grace's actual legacy.Even in 1956, the popular taste was shifting to faster paced entertainments with more emphasis on car chases and adventure than language and communication. Ferenc Molnar's original 1923 play (he was also responsible for the 1921 LILIOM which became Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein's CAROUSEL, filmed the same year as THE SWAN) was from a quieter age between the Wars when the popular taste was willing to look within the provinces of mythical royalty for its universal stories of human relationships. It seemed talky to a 1956 audience who saw the trappings of a long passed royalty and stopped listening to the very real emotions and honor at the heart of the story. Who wanted to care about the problems of a girl who happened to be living in luxury - and worse, was being torn between the love of two essentially good men? That failure to care - or care to listen - was the audience's loss (and the studio's - it was obviously a very expensive film), for the problems under examination were hardly trivial and the final scene between Alec Guinness and Princess Grace was as moving and true as any that could have been crafted from more earthy elements. Audiences today who care to listen to what literate people are actually saying rather than wallow in explosions and contrived "action" plots will find much to appreciate.I said the film also perpetuated myths about its star. Seeing Princess Grace in this sumptuously costumed and technically undemanding setting, it's easy to believe she was the "little Philadelphia girl" given the Hollywood treatment and polished there into a "star," but Grace Kelly was far from the a Hollywood naif. She came from one of the wealthiest families in Philadelphia, and a not unconnected one theatrically. Her uncle, George Kelly, was a Pulitzer Prize winning playwright who probably inspired Grace's theatrical ambitions.Before finding an all too brief position in the Hollywood pantheon, Kelly graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York and polished her craft in at least two productions on Broadway, winning a Theatre World Award for her first, a 1949 production of August Strindberg's THE FATHER! In his book "Darling, You Were Wonderful," press agent Harvey Sabinson, who worked on that production, tells of the dedication and generosity of the young actress who he didn't know at the time was so well connected (and when he learned, was not permitted to capitalize upon).While the ending of her story (the far too early death in a car accident at 51 notwithstanding) may be one of seeming fairy tale romance, the true story of Grace Kelly the actress is one of natural ability rewarded through careful preparation and hard work - a tale not unlike the quietly inspiring plot of THE SWAN.</fullReview>

Sets and costumes are magnificent! (Was a real palace used here...or was it constructed on a studio back lot??) This is movie not just for romantics, but also for those who want to know how the other half, (or other 1/200th!) live and think!I would like to see this movie re-made! I suggest ANNE HATHAWAY as Princess Alexandra, JOHNNY DEPP as Tutor Nicolas, and ERIC PIERPOINT as Prince Albert!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alec Guiness' character gay?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A nice old-fashioned story with a hidden message: do what is right. Grace Kelly seems a little self-conscious under the glare of the camera, but beautiful nevertheless. The dashing Louis Jourdan is worth watching on the dance floor scene, as he is good-looking, graceful and romantic. Look for the aunt Symphorosa's wacky, out-of-place comments when it seems that the plot gets a little dry. She adds some off-beat humor and is very likable. Of note, there are several underlying hints that the Prince is probably gay: he takes no notice of Princess Alexandra and the scenes between him and her are painful to watch, because he keep fixing her with a closed expression in his eye (like a man that knows a woman wants him but is not interested because he already has a man!). Be on the lookout for a telling scene between Carl, Symphorosa and Beatrix. They discuss the Prince's preference for the professor's company rather than attempting to court the princess. Enjoy the movie and the subtle style of screen writing from the bygone era of cinema!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The summer of 1955 Grace Kelly read love letters from her real-life prince while sitting on the terrace of the Biltmore Estate in Ashville, N.C., waiting for the cameras to be set up for exterior shots of "The Swan." I saw the film for the first time in 1958 at the 25-cent movies for University of Illinois students in Champaign-Urbana. I thought my date that night looked like Louis Jourdan, the tutor who dared to love a princess. I watched the videotape of "The Swan" just before visiting the Biltmore Estate the summer of 1998. I looked for the rooms in "The Swan." They are studio sets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>See this beautiful film with Grace Kelly before she made the horrible mistake of marrying Prince Rainier. This film pre-figures her mistake; you cannot believe she would go for Alec Guiness but she does, and then she marries Rainier in real life(sic). It's bizzare in the extreme, and almost surreal. Don't miss this; it looks like Disney did it, but you will be riveted to it, esp. if you know Kelly's hsitory.Great performances!</fullReview>
